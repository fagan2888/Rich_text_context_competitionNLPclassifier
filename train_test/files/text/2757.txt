Brief Report
Evaluating the Factor Structure of the MIDI Personality
Scale Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling
MOHSEN JOSHANLOO* Keimyung University
Abstract: This study investigated the factor structure of the 26-item Midlife Develop-
ment Inventory (MIDI) Personality Scale in a sample of 2,720 Americans. It was
found that whereas confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) did not provide an acceptable
fit to the data, exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) provided an accept-
able fit. The results of ESEM revealed that the a priori five-factor structure of person-
ality was generally consistent with the data, and all items had salient loadings on
their target factors. ESEM also revealed that some of the items contributed signifi-
cantly to more than one personality factor. The results are in line with previous
research, and indicate that ESEM is more suitable than CFA for the study of person-
ality traits.
Key words: Midlife Development Inventory (MIDI) Personality Scale, exploratory
structural equation modeling (ESEM), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Big Five,
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS).
The five-factor model of personality traits is
recognized as the dominant paradigm in per-
sonality research. This model posits that most
personality traits can be classified into five
broad domains: Extraversion (E), Openness to
Experience (O), Neuroticism (N), Agreeable-
ness (A), and Conscientiousness (C). There
has been a constant demand for short Big Five
measures. This need is most salient in contexts
in which the respondents' time or energy is
limited. The Midlife Development Inventory
(MIDI) Personality Scale (Lachman &
Weaver, 1997) is among the briefest Big Five
measures.1 The scale has been developed
based on a need to measure personality traits
in less than 5 min to be used in national sur-
veys where time is usually limited. The authors
of the scale created a list of adjectives com-
monly used in prior personality scales to mea-
sure the five personality traits. In pilot studies,
the items that had low variances, factor load-
ings, or item-to-total-scale correlations were
omitted, and new items were added to
increase reliabilities on some scales
(Lachman & Weaver, 1997).
The resulting scale has been included in the
National Study of Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS), and over 110 publications have
used it so far. Lachman (2005) reports correla-
tions ranging from .42 to .81 between the sub-
scales of the MIDI Personality Scale and
those of the 60-item NEO-Five Factor Inven-
tory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1989).
For four of the traits, the correlations were

high, indicating high conceptual overlaps
across the corresponding scales. However,
the correlation between the Agreeableness
subscales was relatively low (.42). This may
be due to the fact that the MIDI Agreeable-
ness items are largely focused on trust and
altruism, whereas the NEO Agreeableness
subscale has a broader conceptual coverage
(Lachman, 2005).
Applying confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA), Zimprich, Allemand, and Lachman
(2012) investigated the factor structure of the
scale using the first wave of the MIDUS data
(collected between 1995 and 1996). They
found that the fit of the original five-factor
model to the data was not acceptable. After
removing one of the items, and allowing five
cross-loadings and six item residual covari-
ances, the fit of the model met the conven-
tional criteria. That traditional CFA has failed
to support the a priori structure of the MIDI
Personality Scale is consistent with a large
body of evidence showing CFA's constant fail-
ure to support the five-factor model across
measures, populations, and languages
(e.g., Chiorri, Marsh, Ubbiali, & Donati, 2016;
Rosellini & Brown, 2011).
CFA's failure to represent personality traits
results from the assumption that each indica-
tor should load on a single factor, and non-
target factor loadings should be fixed at zero.
This assumption has been found to be too
restrictive in practice (Marsh et al., 2010).
What available data show is that many indica-
tors of complex constructs have significant
relationships with more than a single factor.
Exploratory structural equation modeling
(ESEM; Asparouhov & Muthen, 2009) has
proved to be a useful substitute for CFA,
because it allows all indicators to load freely on
all factors. This results in more accurate esti-
mates and better fit. Prior research comparing
CFA and ESEM has shown that ESEM repre-
sents the factor structure of personality traits
considerably better than CFA (e.g., Booth &
Hughes, 2014; Chiorri et al., 2016; Marsh et al.,
2010; Rosellini & Brown, 2011).
When there are no outcomes and/or predic-
tors for the factors in a factor analytic model,
an ESEM is basically identical to an explor-
atory factor analysis (EFA). However, ESEM
offers a lot of advantages over EFA. Specifi-
cally, it
shares many characteristics with CFA that
fundamentally distinguish it from traditional
approaches to EFA, such as tests of predic-
tive relations between latent constructs
adjusted for measurement error, method
factors, correlated uniquenesses, complex
error structures, bifactor models, full mea-
surement invariance over groups or occa-
sions, latent mean structures, differential
item functioning (i.e., noninvariance of item
intercepts), extension of factor analysis to
SEMs, auto-regressive path models of causal
ordering, and multiple-indicator multiple-
cause (MIMIC) models of relations of latent
factors with background and predictor vari-
ables (Marsh, Morin, Parker, & Kaur,
2014, p. 88).
Of crucial importance in the context of the
present study is that ESEM yields model fit
indices that can be compared across ESEM
and CFA models.
Building on the recent developments in the
field of personality research, the present study
sought to reinvestigate the factor structure of
the MIDI Personality Scale with a recently
collected American data set, using both CFA
and ESEM. Given that ESEM has never been
used with short measures of the Big Five, the
present study is expected to contribute evi-
dence on the potential usefulness of ESEM
for brief measures of personality.
Methods
Participants
The MIDUS III data set (Ryff et al., 2014)
was used. The data were collected between
2013 and 2014. The overall MIDUS III sample
consists of 3,294 American respondents
(54.9% females) with a mean age of
63.64 years (SD = 11.35 years). Of the partici-
pants, 574 were excluded because of missing

data on all of the personality items. Hence,
the final sample consisted of 2,720
participants.
Measure
The scale has 26 items, which are presented in
Table 1. Respondents indicate how well the
items describe them, on a scale from 1 (a lot)
to 4 (not at all). The items were reverse-coded
such that higher scores indicated higher levels
of the traits. As shown in Table 1, internal
consistencies ranged from .668 (C) to
.774 (O).
Statistical analysis
The CFA model was specified based on the a
priori factor structure of the scale. In CFA,
because the items are constrained to a single
factor, only 26 factor loadings were freely esti-
mated, and the 104 non-target loadings were
constrained to zero. In contrast, all possible
factor loadings are freely estimated in ESEM.
The mean- and variance-adjusted weighted
least squares (WLSMV) estimator was used,
because the indicators are categorical. An
oblique geomin rotation ( = .5) was used in
ESEM. A minimum cutoff of .90 for the com-
parative fit index (CFI) and a maximum cutoff
of .08 for the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) were considered as
indicative of acceptable fit. The conventional
cutoff point of .30 for size of loading was used
to identify salient loadings to be emphasized
in defining constructs (e.g., Joshanloo, 2016;
Rosellini & Brown, 2011).
Results
Fit indices for both the CFA and ESEM
models are presented in Table 2. As can be
seen, whereas the fit of the CFA model was
unacceptable, the ESEM model provided
acceptable fit. The Bayesian information crite-
rion (BIC) serves as an important index to
compare the fit of the CFA and ESEM models
because it imposes penalties for model com-
plexity. Hence, we can make sure that the fit
advantage of ESEM is not merely due to hav-
ing more free parameters. However, the BIC
is not reported in Mplus when the WLSMV is
used. Therefore, separate analyses were con-
ducted comparing the same CFA and ESEM
models using a robust ML estimator (MLR) to
obtain the BIC. The BIC value of the ESEM
model (144,983.39) was substantially smaller
than that of the CFA model (147,114.32), indi-
cating that the fit advantage of the less con-
strained ESEM model is enough to offset the
penalty for having more free parameters than
the CFA model. Five alternative ESEM
models were also tested with different num-
bers of factors. As shown in Table 2, the fit of
the one- to four-factor models was not accept-
able. The six-factor model fitted the data bet-
ter than the five-factor model. However, one
of the factors in the six-factor model had only
two salient indicators (Creative and Imagina-
tive). It is recommended to restrict the num-
ber of factors to those having at least three
salient variables, because two variables lack
reliable variance to form a nontrivial construct
(Gorsuch, 1997; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).
In addition, the five-factor model is more the-
oretically sensible. Therefore, the five-factor
model was considered as superior.
Standardized factor loadings for the 5-factor
models are presented in Table 3. In CFA, all
of the factor loadings were over .30 with the
exception of Careless. In ESEM, all of the
items had loadings over .30 or very close to

.30 on their target factor. In addition, the
results of ESEM revealed 78 significant non-
target loadings. However, the target loadings
were considerably stronger than the non-
target loadings. More specifically, disregarding
the direction of the loadings, the 26 target
loadings averaged .591, whereas the 104 non-
target loadings averaged .101. Seven of the
secondary loadings exceeded or were very
close to the cutoff point of .30. These included:
Warm, Sophisticated, and Adventurous on E;
Careless on N; Active and Intelligent on C;
and Friendly on A. The factor correlations are
presented in Table 4. The ESEM correlations
(irrespective of the direction) averaged .18,
whereas the CFA correlations averaged .41,
indicating that CFA yielded decreased factor
orthogonality.
In sum, ESEM provided better fit and
revealed a large number of non-trivial cross-
loadings, which are fixed at zero in CFA.
Thus, ESEM provided more nuanced and
comprehensive information on the relation-
ships between the items and factors.
Discussion
Consistent with many previous studies with
other personality measures (e.g., Chiorri et al.,
2016; Marsh et al., 2010; Rosellini & Brown,
2011), the ESEM model provided a better fit
than did CFA. Inspection of the factor load-
ings (Table 3) suggests that the emerging fac-
tors in ESEM correspond to the five
personality factors, in that each factor is
clearly dominated by items related to one of
the Big Five. All of the factors are predomi-
nantly loaded by their target items. To a con-
siderably smaller degree, the factors are also
loaded by non-target items. Thus, based on
the results of ESEM, it can be concluded that
the five-factor model of personality is largely
compatible with the data in the present
sample.
O had no salient loadings from non-target
items. The other four factors, however, had
factor loadings from non-target items that
were larger than or close to .30 (i.e., three
non-target loadings on E, one on N, two on C,
and one on A). These salient secondary load-
ings should be considered when interpreting
these factors. It is also important to note that
five items had larger secondary than primary
loadings, or their primary and secondary load-
ings were almost equal. These items include
Sophisticated, Adventurous, Intelligent,
Active, and Friendly. Each of these items is
contributing almost equally to two personality
traits. If these results are replicated in future
large-scale studies, researchers may consider
removing these five items or replacing them
with other items.
CFA models of the personality traits have
regularly been found to provide poor fit
(Church & Burke, 1994; Lee & Ashton,
2007), and the present CFA model did not
fare any better. In fact, many researchers
have questioned "the adequacy of CFA
in the study of personality structure"
(Rosellini & Brown, 2011, p. 28), and have
concluded that CFA is "too restrictive to

(Borkenau & Ostendorf, 1990, p. 523). CFA
does not seem to be well suited for analyzing
personality data because many believe that
cross-loadings are actually expected in per-
sonality measures. For example, McCrae,
Zonderman, Costa, Bond, and Paunonen
(1996) state that "there is no theoretical rea-
son why traits should not have meaningful
loadings on three, four, or five factors"

measures confirm that items with more than
one salient loading are far from rare in the
five-factor structure of personality traits
(e.g., Chiorri et al., 2016; Marsh et al., 2010).
Research in other fields of psychology also
indicates that completely pure items of
psychological constructs with no correlations
with other constructs are hard to come by
(Asparouhov, Muthén, & Morin, 2015;
Joshanloo, 2016). Therefore, from both sub-
stantive and statistical standpoints, the
restriction of zero cross-loadings imposed by
CFA can often be considered unwarranted
and misleading, which can also bias the esti-
mation of non-constrained parameters. Thus,
the present ESEM results converge with the
bulk of previous research to intensify the con-
cern over using CFA for analyzing measure-
ment models of personality.
Previous CFA studies of personality traits
have often relied on post hoc modifications
to reach an acceptable fit. However, making
exploratory use of CFA in personality
research has been criticized. Post hoc adjust-
ments are usually misleading unless the ini-
tial model provides a reasonably good fit
(MacCallum, 1986). If the initial model is
markedly different from the true model, as
was the case in the present study and in
many previous CFA studies of personality,
post hoc adjustments are unlikely to lead to
the correct measurement model (Brown &
Moore, 2012). Given that the initial CFA
models in prior research have been typically
ill fitting, extreme caution should be exer-
cised when interpreting the modified models.
Moreover, it is usually ignored that con-
straining many non-trivial factor loadings to
zero can make the discovery of truly misspe-
cified loadings even more difficult. Even
extensive post hoc adjustments of CFA
models of personality may fail to provide
an acceptable fit (Borkenau & Ostendorf,
1990). Therefore, to achieve simple struc-
ture, using rotation of the factor matrix
(as in ESEM/EFA) seems to be more effec-
tive than relying on post hoc modification as
commonly performed in CFA (Browne,
2001). ESEM usually provides better-fitting
models, and reduces researchers' reliance on
post hoc modifications.
The present ESEM results are different
from the CFA results of Zimprich et al. (2012)
in many important ways (it is notable that the
item Thorough was not used in their analyses,
because the item has been added in later ver-
sions of the scale). Zimprich et al. omitted the
item Careless from the scale due to a small
factor loading, which is consistent with the
present CFA results. However, in the present
ESEM analysis, this item had a salient loading
on C, offering no justification for removing
it. Secondly, Zimprich et al. permitted five
cross-loadings in their CFA model based on
CFA modification indices, of which only one
matches the pattern of seven salient
cross-loadings in the present ESEM model
(i.e., Friendly on A). Third, Zimprich
et al. also allowed six residual covariances to
improve fit, which was not needed in the pre-
sent ESEM analysis, because the fit of the
model was already acceptable. This shows that
if all of the cross-loadings are freely estimated,
the need for specifying item residual covari-
ances may be largely eliminated. Finally, they
found the factor correlations to be consider-
ably higher than those found in the present
ESEM analysis. This elevation of factor corre-
lations is a result of the constraints on second-
ary loadings in simple-structure CFA.
Constraining non-trivial cross-loading enlarges
the "burden on the factor correlations to
reproduce the correlations among indicators
loading on different factors because there are
no cross-loadings to assist in these model-
implied estimates" (Brown, 2015, p. 178). The
result is that factor correlations are usually of
greater magnitude in CFA than ESEM
(Marsh et al., 2010).
In view of the pattern of factor loadings,
researchers are encouraged to use ESEM
when studying this personality measure to
obtain more accurate estimates. The ESEM
measurement model can be readily expanded
to include predictive relations between the fac-
tors and directional relations between the fac-
tors and external variables (Marsh et al.,
2014). If using ESEM is not possible, an

alternative option would be to specify CFA
models based on the results of previous ESEM
analyses in the same population (Joshanloo,
2017). For example, researches can include the
salient secondary loadings found in the present
study in their future CFA models in American
samples. The ESEM results can also be used
when analyzing composite measures (e.g., sum
scores). An item with two salient loadings can
be used in calculating the scores of both of the
traits on which the item loads. When using
composite measures, some researchers may
also choose to discard items with salient cross-
loadings (Sass & Schmitt, 2010).
It is noteworthy that although simple-
structure CFA has virtually always failed to
support the measurement models of personal-
ity, CFA still has great potential in personality
research. The general conclusion from studies
that have used both ESEM and CFA in this
field is that CFA should not be abandoned
(Booth & Hughes, 2014; Furnham, Guenole,
Levine, & Chamorro-Premuzic, 2013).
Although ESEM has proved to be a better
analytic strategy in the field of personality, it
should be acknowledged that ESEM is an
exploratory method, and is most useful in ini-
tial stages of model building and scale devel-
opment (Booth & Hughes, 2014). After
enough information on the loadings is accumu-
lated by ESEM studies with large and diverse
samples, CFA studies can utilize the emerging
information to develop more parsimonious
models. Therefore, the main concern is not
the usage of CFA in the field. Instead, the
main concern is that more exploratory tech-
niques, such as ESEM, are underused.
Accordingly, personality researchers are
encouraged to use exploratory techniques
until enough information is accumulated on
various personality measures to ensure that a
transition from exploratory to confirmatory
analysis is warranted.
In sum, given that the a priori five-factor
structure of the scale was replicated, and all of
the items had salient loadings on their target
factors, it can be concluded that the scale mea-
sures the intended constructs. This study also
illustrates that ESEM can serve as a useful
tool in the study of brief measures of personal-
ity traits. It will need to be borne in mind,
however, that some of the items of the scale
contribute substantially to non-target factors, as
is the case with many other psychological scales
(Joshanloo, 2016; Marsh et al., 2010). The pres-
ence of secondary loadings necessitates the use
of ESEM in future research with the scale.
These findings, if replicated in additional
research, may also be considered as the main
source on which to rely for optimizing the scale.
