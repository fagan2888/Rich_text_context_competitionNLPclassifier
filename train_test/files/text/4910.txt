Introduction
Given many U.S. households' lack of active participation in
the financial market and the increasing sophistication of
financial products, legislators and market analysts suggest
that access to financial education would increase financial
knowledge, improve financial decision making, and
strengthen market participation (Greenspan, 2005; Mandell,
2009; Willis, 2008). America's recent credit and housing
crisis suggests that informed financial decision making may
be important to a more stable national economy. In the past
15 years, financial education and Individual Development
Account (IDA) programs have been implemented to teach
adults and youth about savings and investments and to link
them with the mainstream financial sector (Shobe & Sturm,
2007). However, the majority of research in the area of IDA
programming has been conducted with adults.
Limited available research on youth suggests that high
school financial education is associated with improved
financial decision making (Bernheim, Garrett, & Maki,
2001), whereas other data indicate that financial behavior
and decision making are more directly influenced by one's
family of origin than by one's formal financial education
(Shim, Barber, Card, Xiao, & Serido, 2010). Youth savings
rates, for example, are often closely related to their parents'
savings behaviors (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999). Because the
available literature is largely focused on outcomes, it is dif-
ficult to understand the reasons for these competing find-
ings. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the
perspectives of youth themselves and the important
relationships between financial education, family environ-
ment, and financial behavior.
Literature Review
Financial Literacy and Financial Education
Although limited, current findings suggest that youth finan-
cial education can have positive effects on long- and short-
term measures (Masa et al., 2010). For example, a recent
qualitative study exploring the perception of participants
in a child savings program (Elliott, Sherraden, Johnson,
& Guo, 2009) indicated that children who saved in the
program perceived "that savings is a way to help pay for
college" (p. 1). In the short term, Masa et al. (2010) con-
ducted a review of current literature on the associations
between youth savings and well-being and found significant
relationships between youth savings and increased
(a) savings, income, and the development of other assets;
(b) self-esteem and social group participation; (c) reproduc-
tive and sexual health knowledge; (d) safe-sex behavior;
and (e) educational achievement.

"It's All About Security to Me":The Role of
Environment inYouth Financial Literacy and
Savings Behaviors

Abstract
This qualitative study explores financial behavior and expectations in families of origin in addition to youth financial education
and savings behaviors.The authors interviewed 14 youths, aged 17 to 19 years, whose families had low incomes, education
levels,and savings rates and who participated in a youth-based financial education and dedicated savings program and present
key themes and subthemes that were revealed during data analysis. Findings suggest that, rather than replicating the behavior
of their parents and experiencing the same financial struggles, the youths interviewed were motivated by a desire to avoid
these challenges. However, youths in this study also noted that they experienced social and economic barriers that their
higher income peers did not. Policy, practice, and research implications of these findings are discussed.

Given these potential benefits, efforts to increase youth
savings and financial literacy are well placed. Nonetheless,
research on the effects of financial education curricula for
youth is inconsistent (see McCormick, 2009). Positive
results include those of Bernheim et al. (2001), whose study
based on survey data collected by telephone from 2,000
young adults found a positive relationship between financial
education training for youth during state-mandated compul-
sory schooling (1957-1982) and increased savings in adult-
hood. In an effort to expand upon this research, Cole and
Shastry (2008) used a representative national sample from
the 2000 Public Use Census Data to examine the relationship
between financial education and later financial market par-
ticipation. Their findings suggested that youth financial edu-
cation programs were not associated with financial market
decisions for either attendees or their children; rather, the
findings suggest that these programs are both costly and
ineffective. Instead, they found that increased financial mar-
ket participation was related to increased educational
achievement and cognitive ability (e.g., higher test scores).
In terms of financial knowledge retention, two different
studies surveyed high school seniors and full-time college
undergraduates who had participated in a high school money
management or personal finance course; neither study found
participants to have more financial knowledge than those
who did not participate in a course (Mandell, 2009; Mandell
& Klein, 2007). Interestingly, Mandell (2007) noted in a
recent nonrandomized study on the use of a Googolplex@
school middle school pilot financial education project that
students in lower grades gain financial knowledge from fun,
interactive financial literacy education.
Family of Origin
Disparate outcome data may be attributable to the lack of
national standards, the absence of a set curriculum for finan-
cial education (McCormick, 2009), or environmental factors
outside the classroom. Recent scholarship suggests that par-
ent attitudes, behaviors, and role modeling play a much
larger role than financial education curricula in shaping their
children's financial knowledge and behaviors. For example,
using a survey with 2,098 college students, researchers
found that those who received financial education in high
school had higher levels of financial knowledge, but the
most important predictor of student financial behavior was
parent financial behavior (Shim et al., 2010). In addition,
researchers using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) found that bank account and stock ownership for a
sample of 1,933 adults (25-54 years old) was influenced by
parental account ownership (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999).
Furthermore, Chiteji and Stafford (2000) also found that
children's exposure to family asset development helps explain
future financial knowledge and asset development for later
generations. The authors used the term parental learning
effect to describe the fundamental knowledge children
acquire from their parents regarding wealth accumulation.
In a qualitative study that explored past and current savings
experiences of a small sample (N = 10) of adult African
American women, findings suggested that, for the majority
of women, parental role modeling and education regarding
savings played an integral role in their decision to save and
the manner in which they saved as a child, youth, and adult
(Shobe & Christy-McMullin, 2007).
Still, minimal research has been conducted on the role of
low-income parents in shaping financial knowledge and
decision making for their children (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999).
Furthermore, researchers have not fully examined the ways
in which youth learn about and replicate their families'
behaviors related to financial decision making and savings.
As stated by Shim et al. (2010), "although we do know that
parents are the primary socialization agents in the process by
which children learn how to function in the marketplace as
consumers and money managers, we have not clearly defined
the specific roles that parents play" (p. 1458).
Current Study
From an ecological systems perspective (Germain &
Gitterman, 1981; Bronfenbrenner, 1989), the financial
behaviors of youth and young adults are best understood
within the context of their environments. Bronfenbrenner
(1979) depicted human growth and development as an
interactional and nested process between multiple levels of
environment, including the self and one's immediate envi-
ronment (microsystem), larger organizations such as schools
(mesosystem), and broader cultural, political, and economic
forces (macrosystem). In this view, human thought pro-
cesses and behavior are best described as a product of these
interactions.
Financial education, then, though an amiable goal, may
fall short of expectations if youth are not seen as part of an
interconnected whole. For this reason, we plan to extend
Charles and Hurst's (2003) suggestion to examine the role
of parent financial behavior in shaping youth financial
knowledge, skills, and behaviors to also include the effects
on youth savings.
The aim of this descriptive, qualitative research project is
to better understand the role of environment in youth finan-
cial decision making and determine whether this may explain
previously mixed results on the efficacy of financial educa-
tion. To this end, this study seeks to capture the perspectives
and experiences of the 14 youths who participated in an IDA
savings program and to present the key themes and sub-
themes that reflect their perspectives and experiences, rela-
tive to (a) financial decision making in the family of origin;
(b) savings successes, challenges, and expectations in the
family of origin; and (c) their perceptions of the IDA experi-
ences. We also plan to examine past and current savings
behaviors and future savings aspirations of the youths in this
study. This study will remain descriptive in nature as we seek
Hamilton et al. 3
a deeper understanding of the personal experiences of par-
ticipants (Rubin & Babbie, 2001).
Due to the limited availability of research in this area, it
was necessary to engage in a small scale, exploratory study.
Previous qualitative research has found this model useful.
For example, Shobe and Christy-McMullin (2007) used a
small sample of 10 participants to explore the influence of
parental role modeling and education in savings behavior
among African American women.
Method
Background and Protocol
Students were recruited from the "Cash for College" IDA
savings program, which is sponsored by a large economic
development nonprofit agency in northwest Arkansas. Cash
for College offers an 8-hr financial literacy course to high
school students and 4:1 matched dedicated Individual
Development Savings Accounts (IDAs). Students are
required to deposit at least US$250 into their IDA accounts
over the course of 1 year, at which point the program con-
tributes an additional US$1,000. Funds from this program
can only be withdrawn for higher education expenses,
including tuition, fees, books, and supplies. The program is
open to students whose families have annual earned incomes
within 200% of the federal poverty guidelines.
Prior to the interviews, a research proposal was submitted
to the University of Arkansas Institutional Review Board for
approval. Students and their parents were provided with a
letter explaining the purpose of the study (including potential
risks and benefits and the voluntary nature of the study) and
an informed consent form. Students aged 18 and above were
allowed to sign consent forms themselves; however, minor
students required written parental consent.
In each interview, the researchers explained that some
questions were of a sensitive and personal nature. Each par-
ticipant was given the option to skip any question he or she
wished. All participants were given US$25 following the
interview. This amount was chosen so as to show gratitude
for the participants' time without being coercive (Berg,
2008). Participant names were replaced with a code number
and no identifying information was associated with tran-
scripts or interview notes.
The audio-recorded interviews lasted between 30 min
and 1.5 hr and were later transcribed. The interview guide
included open-ended questions grouped in four main areas.
The first area included questions to capture demographics
relative to the child such as his or her race/ethnicity, age,
gender, housing composition, primary caregiver, employ-
ment status, and whether they have a savings or checking
account other than the IDA and the child's account of demo-
graphics relative to his or her family (parent's employment
status, family's income and type of employment held by
parents). The second group of questions explored the child's
perspectives of his or her family's economic situation and
financial behaviors. For example, who makes financial
decision in the family, how does the family manage fiscally,
the saving and financial patters and behaviors the child per-
ceives within his or her family (e.g., spending and savings
patterns, what does the family save for, what does the family
spend on, how does the family make decisions about sav-
ings and spending; what rules do the parents voice and what
rules do they enforce relative to savings and spending); the
child's reflections of economically challenging times and
how the child perceived the family functioned during such
times; the child's account of the parent's history of home
ownership and savings, child's account of family's social
support network and resources, and child's account of mes-
sages his or her parents give about savings and education;
the child's account of whether money matters are discussed
openly in his or her immediate family. The third group of
questions explored the child's perspective on his or her
financial behaviors and patterns prior to joining the IDA
program and since joining the idea program. For example,
how he or she acquired money before and post IDA, what
does he or she do with the money earned, where do they
keep their money (e.g., bank, piggy bank, give it to parents
to keep); the child's thoughts and feelings about money and
savings; future orientation relative to savings and spending
(goals regarding home ownership, business ownership,
asset purchases etc.); strategies they have used to work
toward financial goals, challenges they have encountered in
trying to save or achieve a financial goal, success stories
relative to savings and finances; and savings goals. The last
group of questions explored the child's thoughts, experi-
ence, and feelings related to the IDA program. For example,
how they learned about the program, what interested them
in the program, accounts of success and challenges relative
to experiences in the program, accounts of how the program
works, suggestion for program improvements, accounts of
other aspects of the program and what if anything they
gained from the other aspects (e.g., financial literacy), per-
ceptions of why IDAs were created, and the child's percep-
tion of the effects IDA participation could have for other
children and families.
Study Participants
Fourteen students, ranging in age from 17 to 19 (with a mean
age of 17 years 11 months), were interviewed regarding their
savings experiences, strategies, and perspectives (see Table
1 for demographic details). Utilizing a purposive sampling
strategy (Berg, 2008), we derived our sample from youths
participating in an IDA program in northwest Arkansas. All
youths who participated in the IDA program between
February and July 2010 were asked to participate in this
study. Study participants included 4 males (29%) and 10
females. Eight of the sample (57%) self-reported their race
as non-Hispanic Caucasian, 4 (21%) as Asian American, 1
4 SAGE Open
(7%) as Latino, and 2 (14%) as biracial (in both cases,
Caucasian and Native American).
Participants were also asked about family housing and
household composition. Two of the students (14%) lived
with their families in rental housing; the remaining 86%
lived in owner-occupied housing. The average household
size for participants was four members (with a range of 2-9
members), with an average of 1.5 minors living in the home
(with a range of 0-6 children). When asked about the family
member who serves as their primary caregiver, five students
(36%) reported their mother, four reported their father (28%),
one student (7%) reported both parents, one student (7%)
reported her grandparents, and three students (21%) reported
another type of caregiver. Four students (29%) reported that
their household was currently receiving some type of gov-
ernment support (e.g., food stamps, disability insurance,
Women, Infants and Children [WIC], Temporary Assistance
to Needy Families [TANF]).
Finally, students were asked about their personal employ-
ment and financial behavior. Two youths (14%) worked full-
time, nine (64%) worked part-time, and the remaining three
did not work. These findings may be somewhat skewed as
some students were interviewed during the school year, but
several others were interviewed during the summer, when
employment practices might change. Five of the students
(36%) had personal checking accounts, and only four (28%)
had a savings account outside of their IDA account.
Data Analysis
The data analysis involved two main phases. The first phase
used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
software to descriptively analyze the demographic informa-
tion. Because we were interested in exploring the students'
perceptions of their family background relative to their moti-
vations for IDA participation, we selected thematic analysis
for the second and central phase of analysis. Thematic
analysis is common in qualitative methods as it focuses on
capturing the depth of central themes and allows the data to
be organized around such themes (Marks & Yardley, 2004).
All transcripts were reviewed by two members of the
research team, who independently reviewed each transcript
in search of data responses related to family background and
motivation for IDA participation to generate a first round of
subthemes relative to the two primary themes. Using a con-
stant comparative method (Merriam, 1998), the two mem-
bers met on several occasions to discuss and compare their
individual findings and to ensure research consistency.
Analysis of each narrative involved a sentence-by-sentence
review, seeking and identifying open codes (Ryan & Bernard,
2000). During the earlier round of analysis, open coding
identified potential themes and short segments of text were
color-coded according to their connection to the two prede-
termined themes (Ryan & Bernard, 2000). On the right-hand
side of the transcript, codes or categories were written.
During the later stages of analysis, axial coding was com-
pleted. This phase of the analysis involved identifying rela-
tionships among codes and collapsing these codes into core
categories. Finally, selective coding occurred, in which
broader, more inclusive categories were formulated as sub-
themes of the broader themes.
Trustworthiness
Several measures have been taken in an effort to improve
the trustworthiness of our findings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
For instance, each participant was informed of confidential-
ity to facilitate his or her comfort in responding and to
improve credibility. Confidentiality was reiterated before
youths were asked their opinions of the program.
Furthermore, findings were triangulated theoretically by
comparing our results with previous research. To expand
transferability and dependability, we have attempted to
describe our processes in detail. Finally, two authors coded
the interviews separately and then compared themes in an
effort to decrease bias and create greater confirmability
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Findings
This study sought to capture the key themes that emerged
from the participants' accounts of financial decision making
in their family of origin, the challenges and successes rela-
tive to savings and the participants' experiences within the

IDA program. The following section presents the primary
themes and subthemes that were revealed.
Financial Decision Making in the Family of Origin
Money is a stressful subject. Most of the youths in this study
expressed that money was "stressful" for their families and
was often "difficult to come by" or "pretty tight." Families
often had to prioritize expenses, putting mortgage/rent, utili-
ties, and auto insurance ahead of savings for the future. Many
students reported that even covering basic expenses could be
difficult. One said, "I can't go certain places because we
don't have enough gas money, and we can't buy certain
things like food because we don't have enough and we have
to pay for bills." Speaking about her mother, another stated,
"If she gets behind on anything . . . [it's] probably the rent,
because she wants to keep the electricity running. She can
usually talk to the landlord."
Something unexpected is always coming up. With such tight
budgets, many of the youths reported that unexpected
expenses, such as a car repair or a life event (divorce, death
in the family), often created a financial emergency for the
family. For example, one participant said, "When my parents
got divorced . . . we were low on food and clothes and we had
to stay at my uncle's house for a while." Another reported,
"We used to have an auto care business too and because of
the economy . . . [it] went down, plus my brother got cancer."
Other students reported that illness, death, and increases in
gas prices had caused significant financial crises for their
families. To deal with financial emergencies, families used
various coping strategies. Some families would "go in the
hole," "tighten the budget," or get a "second job." Several of
the participants reported that their families borrowed money
from extended family to cover lean times.
Savings Success, Challenges, and Expectations
in the Family of Origin
No models for savings but lots of encouragement to save.
Most of the youths reported that their families had no sav-
ings of their own, and only two families had established
retirement accounts. Furthermore, very few students could
think of a time when their families spoke of saving for the
future or for a specific goal. All of the youths, however,
reported that their parents encourage them to save.
Education matters. Most families placed a high priority on
higher education, with the hope that it would culminate in
employment. One student, expressing a common response,
stated, "My mom really wants me to go to college. . . . She wants
me to have a good job."Among all the youths in this study, pay-
ing for college was a financial concern for the family.
Perception of the IDA Experience
Financial education. As discussed, students in this IDA pro-
gram are also required to attend a series of financial literacy
courses. Prior to beginning the program, most of the youths
had never had any sort of financial education. Most reported
enjoying the courses, but were primarily motivated to enter
the program by the availability of matching funds. One stu-
dent said, "I think it's very beneficial because I learned a lot
about things I didn't know." Several students reported that
the classes encouraged them to continue saving. When asked
about the overall benefit of the program, one student said,
"It's a good way to motivate savings." A few of the youths,
however, wished for more hands-on learning methods.
Saving. Most of the youths in this study had begun saving
before beginning the program and intended to continue sav-
ing after meeting their US$250 goal. One reported, "I'm
going to have my own savings account."Another said, "I just
heard about monetary bonds and savings bonds. I'll look at
them." Some of the students wanted to continue saving for
college, and others hoped to purchase a car with their future
savings. When asked, all of the students saw themselves as
future homeowners.
Still, many of the students experienced their own barriers
to savings. Several contributed to the family in times of
financial strain. A student with several younger brothers and
sisters stated, "For the past few months I've been helping
out, so I haven't really had money, just to feed everyone and
myself. . . . But I've been trying my hardest to get a lot of
hours . . . and try to put money away." Another said, "We
kind of all help a little bit. My sister works and helps."
The majority of students interviewed were employed and
paying for many of their personal expenses such as car insur-
ance, food, clothing, and cell phone bills. Most reported that
they avoided "unnecessary" spending. One noted that she
tried "to focus on what I need and not what I want." Another
stated, "When I cash my check, I automatically save and that
way I don't waste any because I don't have it." When asked
about their reasons for saving money, most of the youths saw
it as security from the type of financial instability experi-
enced in their families. One said, "It feels really good to
save. It makes me feel like I have . . . peace of mind."Another
saw her savings as "something I can use in emergency cir-
cumstances so I'm not completely lost. I like foundation."
Finally, a third student explained that saving "means I sleep,
really. I become incredibly sick and stressed when I don't
feel secure. It's all about security to me and not worrying."
Discussion and Implications
Family Economic Situation
Family financial status. In discussing their families' finan-
cial situations, the majority of the youths in our study noted
that their families were currently experiencing a great deal
of financial difficulty. Several even commented that their
families found it difficult to meet basic expenses for
food, clothing, and shelter and, as a result, had to prioritize
which expenses (e.g., electricity vs. rent) were more impor-
tant. When youths provided reasons for their economic
6 SAGE Open
difficulties, it became clear that an economic crisis or two
played an integral role, at times, in impacting their current
financial difficulties. For example, youths mentioned the
economic recession, resulting unemployment, gas prices,
car repairs, illness, divorce, and death of a loved one as
unexpected economic crises they had experienced.
Family savings for future assets. Given that none of the
heads of household in this study had money in savings, they
engaged in several short- and long-term strategies to help
make ends meet. Some of the strategies they used, including
borrowing money and going into debt, tend to create longer
term financial burdens; other approaches, such as taking a
second job and tightening their budget, offer fewer long-
term difficulties.
Turning to long-term goals, not surprisingly, youths noted
that their parents and caregivers would like them to go to
college. However, because their families did not have sav-
ings for this purpose, other than the IDA, many saw postsec-
ondary education as a great financial concern.
These findings suggest that opportunities are needed for
low-income individuals and families to set aside funds to
address financial crises. Although the youths in our study
were participating in an IDA dedicated savings program,
their parents were not. It may, therefore, be beneficial for
parents as well as youths to participate in an asset develop-
ment program so that families can survive economic crises
without getting into further debt.
Youth Economic Situation
Financial literacy. The overall sentiment from participants
was that they enjoyed taking the financial literacy courses;
several noted that this was the first time in their lives that
they had had access to this important information. In addi-
tion to the attainment of financial literacy knowledge, the
youths also noted the intangible benefits of the economic lit-
eracy classes, including the support and encouragement they
received from the instructor and each other. When asked for
suggestions regarding how the classes could be improved,
several youths suggested adding "hands-on" economic liter-
acy learning opportunities. This feedback is in keeping with
findings from Johnson and Sherraden (2007), who suggested
that, though financial education is important for young chil-
dren and youth, "financial capability"--or the ability to
receive financial education and to participate in economic
life through actions and behaviors--is ideal. The authors
suggested that providing hands-on banking experiences for
youth helps them link knowledge to behaviors.
Savings behaviors. When asked about their previous expe-
riences with saving, the majority of participants reported that
they had engaged in savings behaviors prior to joining the
IDA program. Thus, it may be that youth with savings expe-
riences are more motivated to join an IDA program than
other youth.
However, because the youth did not all have prior savings
experience, it is important to interpret these findings with
care. IDA research has demonstrated that low- and moder-
ate-income individuals can and do save when opportunities
are provided. Therefore, though it would be easy to conclude
from this research that certain individuals have a proclivity to
save, this would be an erroneous assumption. What we need
to examine in further research studies is the underlying moti-
vating factor for savings in some individuals versus others.
As Sherraden (1991) pointed out, even some middle- and
upper-income individuals choose not to engage in dedicated
retirement savings plans, even if it is in their long-term
financial best interests to do so.
Meaning of savings. Interestingly, the emotional benefits of
savings appear to have a larger impact on youth than the sav-
ings themselves. In terms of what saving means to them,
youths noted that they wanted to avoid following in their
parents'footsteps. Instead, they were willing to avoid unnec-
essary spending and learn more about different forms of
asset development (e.g., savings, home ownership, invest-
ments) so that they could achieve financial security and have
peace of mind. These findings fit with previous research that
suggests that it is not the amount of the asset that has the
highest benefit for individuals and their families but the
ownership of the asset itself (Sherraden, 1991).
Barriers to saving. Despite their participation in the pro-
gram, the youths were not immune to experiencing barriers
to saving. Given that they all resided in low-income house-
holds, many youths reported that they often had to give their
earnings and potential savings to help offset household costs
related to food, rent, and clothing. Some youths also had
their own personal expenses, including car payments and
cell phone bills, which reduced potential savings.
These financial barriers to savings cannot be taken lightly,
as youth know that if they do not contribute to the household
expenses, their basic needs will go unmet. Thus, the sugges-
tion that IDAs need to be offered to both youth and adults in
the household is an important one. In this way, families can
meet their basic needs and, perhaps, save for future eco-
nomic crises.
Clearly, the financial behavior of youth is critically inter-
twined with the family environment. Any well-meaning
efforts at financial education will be thwarted if youth have
barriers to savings that their higher income peers do not,
such as contributing to the household income and paying for
their own necessities such as clothing and car insurance.
Future policy and programming will need to consider the
holistic needs of low-income families, providing financial
support and education for both parents and youth. Future
research should investigate the effect of such multigenera-
tional programming.
Limitations
While these results are compelling, it is important to mention
that they are limited by our method of sampling. Because
we surveyed youth who were voluntarily participating in
a savings and financial education program, a significant
Hamilton et al. 7
self-selection effect was created (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). As
a result, saving might be more important to these students
than to their peers who chose not to participate in the pro-
gram. The goal of this qualitative research is not, however, to
create generalizability. We have instead attempted to create
an in-depth description of this particular phenomenon to
maximize potential transferability for future research.
