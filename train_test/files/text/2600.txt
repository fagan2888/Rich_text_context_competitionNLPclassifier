chronic inflammation and quality of life in
older adults

Abstract
Background: This article summarizes exploratory analyses of relationships between chronic inflammation, its
physical consequences, and quality of life (QoL). It summarizes key findings from preliminary analyses, and
contextualizes these results with extant sociomedical literature to recommend directions for future research.
Methods: Cross-sectional data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) were used to
explore these relationships. Inflammation was assessed via the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined
associations between CRP levels and two different domains of QoL: happiness with life in general and happiness
with intimate relationships. We used ordinal logistic regression with companion OLS models and Sobel-Goodman
tests to assess potential mediation, and also conducted a variety of sensitivity analyses.
Results: Findings suggest that mediation pathways for the overall association between chronic inflammation and
QoL may differ markedly across particular outcome constructs. Specifically, it shows mediation potential for the
clinical sequelae of chronic inflammation in frameworks using happiness as an outcome measure, but not in those
using relationship satisfaction. Disability appears to mediate the effect of inflammation by 27 %; chronic pain
appears to exert a similar mediation effect of 21 %.
Conclusions: Pain and disability linked to chronic inflammation appear to play a small but significant mediating
role in the overall reduction in QoL observed among older adults with biomarker evidence of chronic inflammation.
We note that these patterns are best framed as dynamic elements of a complex causal fabric, rather than powerful
determinants that override other factors contributing to QoL. Hypotheses for further exploration using longitudinal
data from the NSHAP are thus offered, pending availability of Wave III data in future years.

Background
The relationship between chronic conditions and quality
of life (QoL) represents a key focus in medical sociology
research [1]. Many of the conditions that sociomedical
scientists have explored are inflammatory in nature [2].
Examples include arthritis [3­8]; inflammatory bowel
disease [9­14]; interstitial cystitis [15­19]; and asthma
[20­22]. These studies consistently show that chronic
disease can reduce QoL in a variety of domains [23].
Consistent negative associations have been identified
between chronic inflammatory disease and overall happi-
ness with life, as well as satisfaction with intimate rela-
tionships [24].
Literature on inflammatory disease and QoL suggests
that these negative associations may be mediated by com-
mon medical consequences of chronic illness [25]. These
sequelae generally include functional limitation and/or
persistent pain [2]. Sociology distinguishes between "limi-
tation" and "disability" as well as "pain" and "suffering" by
illuminating how physical experiences become sources of
social disadvantage [26]. In turn, these challenges can re-
duce QoL by producing feelings of social alienation [27],
derailed progress [28], and lost identity [29]. These
changes may arise via multiple social and clinical

mechanisms associated with chronic disease, including the
pathology of inflammation and any resultant clinical
diagnoses.
Biomarker data can offer insight into the potential me-
diating impact of formal diagnosis for people who live
with inflammatory pathology. Indeed, medical sociolo-
gists have begun to use biomarker data as a complement
to diagnosed inflammatory disease in assessing health.
The common inflammatory biomarker C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) often captures chronic inflammation particu-
larly well due to its unique attributes [30]. Consequently,
it has emerged as a predictor of interest in many socio-
logical studies of inflammatory disease. Reliable associa-
tions have been found between blood levels of CRP and
a variety of QoL outcomes [24, 31].
Much of the sociological literature on relationships be-
tween chronic disease and QoL focuses on how these
conditions produce consequences that are both medical
and social in nature. Indeed, a key contribution of this
literature is the idea that disease only becomes illness
under certain circumstances: when it affects identity for-
mation processes [26] and/or threatens individuals' sense
of being whole [32]. These same concepts offer insight
into how common sociomedical sequelae from chronic
conditions may mediate associations between inflamma-
tory chronic disease and QoL. Specifically, relationships
between inflammatory biomarker levels and QoL may be
mediated by diagnosis, disability, and pain.
Diagnosis reflects a variety of physical experiences that
can later translate to disadvantages in the social world.
Indeed, receiving a diagnosis formalizes a given person's
transition into the role of patient [26]. This shift occurs
through the process of medicalization [33] because
health care providers assert social control over people
entering into the patient role [34] and thus confer legit-
imacy [35­37]. Diagnosis can facilitate access to roles
[38], accommodations [39], resiliency [40], coherence
[41, 42], and relationships [43] that help people cope. At
the same time, diagnosis can also brand people as devi-
ant [36, 37], alienate people from themselves [41, 42],
and instill feelings of hopelessness [28, 41]. Diagnosis
also brings expectations to work actively toward recov-
ery [38], remain positive and hopeful [39], and weather
suffering with good humor [42]. For people with chronic
conditions, these expectations are often unrealistic [39]
and the resulting disappointment can lead others to offer
less support over time [41].
Like diagnosis, disability is as much a social construct
as it is a medical one [26]. Functional impairment be-
comes disability when it becomes inhibiting in social
contexts [32]. This can bring a variety of negativeconse-
quences for social life [44]. Coping with these
consequences can also lead to unexpected positive expe-
riences. Having a physical disability thus does not
necessarily result in low QoL, but can introduce signifi-
cant impediments to people's overall sense of well-being
and fulfillment [26]. These challenges can include stigma
[37, 45, 46], sanctions for not responding appropriately
to the discrediting behavior of others [42, 45, 46], and
embarrassment from inability to meet normative expec-
tations of behavior [41, 47].
Pain similarly becomes suffering when it produces ad-
verse social consequences [26]. Pain itself can prompt
people to seek medical care [26] and receive a diagnosis
[39], and thus afford access to some of the benefits of this
process. Yet by the same token, both the receipt of a diag-
nosis and the experience of pain can levy dramatic nega-
tive consequences on social life., Showing evidence of pain
can negatively impact both social [26] and medical [39] in-
teractions by introducing feelings of burden and guilt [26],
as well as frustration and disappointment [39] that eventu-
ally lead to anger and [26] withdrawal of social support
[41]. Likewise, medical providers frequently express disap-
pointment in people who have not met the standard de-
mands of the sick role [39]. Specifically, the sick role
involves the core expectation that the person occupying it
will eventually recover and be free of symptoms. Providers
often demonstrate not only disappointment, but also frus-
tration and even outright anger with people who continue
to experience pain from a chronic condition despite ac-
tively undergoing treatment [26].
Sociomedical sequelae of chronic disease thus constitute
generic processes [48] that entrench inequality in health-
related quality of life [49]. Although relatively few sociolo-
gists have studied these dynamics for chronic inflamma-
tion and related diseases specifically, these conditions
share many clinical and social features with other persist-
ent diseases [23, 50]. Sociologists of health can thus use
data on chronic inflammatory pathology and conditions to
explore how pain, disability, and diagnosis may mediate
the overall experience of disease. Many of the datasets that
allow for exploration of these relationships are relatively
new, and thus offer only limited insight into longitudinal
processes. As additional waves of data are collected for
major biosocial projects, cross-sectional inquiry can estab-
lish a foundation for more sophisticated studies using
panel designs when sufficient data become available. We
thus used the two available waves of data from a relatively
new biosocial dataset on older United States adults to test
the mediational effect of inflammatory biomarkers linking
chronic diseases and QoL. In this manuscript we build on
our team's prior work linking inflammatory biomarker
levels and key elements of QoL, as well as social disadvan-
tage and chronic inflammation.
Methods
We used data from Waves I and II of the NSHAP. This
biosocial dataset provides information on physical,

mental, and social health among United States residents
aged 57 to 85 at Wave I. The dataset includes 3005 indi-
vidual cases in total. NSHAP data documentation de-
scribes the study sample as "a nationally representative
probability sample of community-dwelling individuals"
[51]. African Americans, Latinos, males, and persons 75
to 85 years of age are oversampled to boost statistical
power [51]. Data are collected via a combination of
questionnaires, in-home interviews, and clinical exams
(Table 1).
The NSHAP is designed as a panel dataset with mul-
tiple repeated measures. However, only two waves of
NSHAP data are currently available, making the data es-
sentially cross-sectional at present for research questions
requiring three or more waves of data for rigorous as-
sessment in longitudinal context. However, the older age
of the study population [52] does allow for conjecture
about long-term impacts on QoL from a variety of
chronic health conditions. A substantial foundation also
exists [53] for using cross-sectional data to generate hy-
potheses about mediation processes. We thus used avail-
able data from the NSHAP to begin exploring these
processes, with the goal of recommending trajectories
for future research. We used Wave I data to compute
our final models because we did not have three waves of
data to represent each timepoint in the mediation path-
way. This strategy offered the additional advantage of fa-
cilitating comparison of our results in this study to prior
work by our team. However, we did conduct a variety of
sensitivity analyses using the Wave II data, which we de-
scribe at a later point in the manuscript.
To assess inflammation we used serolevels of CRP, a
substance that circulates in the blood of individuals ex-
periencing significant amounts of inflammation. We
note that CRP is a biomarker of inflammation rather
than a direct measure of inflammation itself. CRP pro-
vides compelling evidence that inflammation is present.
The NSHAP contains a continuous measure of total
serum CRP. We retained over 87 % of total participants
with real data on the CRP variable, excluding cases with
very high values due to concerns about biologic plausibil-
ity [49]. According to NSHAP data documentation, these
extremely high values for the approximately 300 add-
itional study participants whose data were not used likely
owed to measurement error [51]. Our initial analytic sam-
ple contained 1684 people whose observed CRP serolevels
varied between 0 and 5.98 milligrams per liter [24].
Prior to running any regressions, we made three sets
of comparisons to ensure that using only data on partici-
pants with a successful CRP assay and then further
restricting the range of CRP values used did not intro-
duce differential bias. First, we compared the full sample
of NSHAP participants to just those with real data for
the CRP variable. Second, we compared those respon-
dents with a successfully assayed CRP value to those
without one. Third, we compared the participants with
real CRP values who were excluded due to concerns
about biologic plausibility to those whose values were in-
cluded. These sensitivity analyses helped us avoid ex-
cluding populations that would yield substantive
additional insight into our research questions.
We measured key elements of QoL using both emo-
tional and relational constructs to facilitate comparison
of results across domains. The NSHAP's "generally feel-
ing happy" and "overall happiness with relationships"
variables, provided data for each QoL component out-
come respectively. These constructs were assessed using
validated questions similar to those from the NSHAP's
immediate predecessor and foundational inspiration, the
National Health and Social Life Survey [51]. These ques-
tions were set up as Likert scales that included numeric
levels with corresponding text descriptors for the end-
points of each scale. Questions were structured as
follows:

Both outcomes were preserved as ordinal measures ra-
ther than dichotomized. Initially we also explored sub-
components of these overall outcomes, which the
NSHAP captures as separate variables such as "physical
satisfaction with relationships" and "emotional satisfac-
tion with relationships". However, we found that analyz-
ing these component outcomes separately afforded little
insight in excess of that yielded by the NSHAP's more
general questions about happiness and relationship
satisfaction.
The "generally feeling happy" variable is an experien-
tial measure of subjective well-being that assesses how
frequently respondents have experienced happiness in
the 12 months prior to participating in interviews. The
"overall happiness with relationships" variable captures
feelings of happiness specifically with respect to intimate
partnerships in the same time window. Because having a
partner can itself contribute to subjective well-being, we
also did some preliminary analysis prior to running re-
gressions that revealed nearly all of the people in our
sample were either married or cohabitating without be-
ing married. Incorporating partnerships as a control
variable thus added little value.
We operationalized physical disability by aggregating in-
formation about activities of daily living and instrumental
activities of daily living with which study participants ex-
perienced difficulty. We chose these measures because
they are both highly validated in the literature [44] and
corroborated by NSHAP interviewers after participants'
initial reporting [51]. We added binary scores for each of
the seven activities of daily living (walking one block,
walking across a room, dressing, bathing, eating, getting in
and out of bed, toileting) and two instrumental activities
of daily living (driving in daylight, driving at night)
assessed by the NSHAP. Specifically, we aggregated each
of the component ADL variables from the NSHAP into a
summative index by adding up possible values (0 or 1 in
all cases) for a maximum disability score of 9 and a mini-
mum score of 0, depending on how many activities people
reported experiencing difficulty in completing. We used
this index to model the potential mediating impact of
functional impairment in associations between chronic in-
flammation and QoL.
We measured persistent pain using the NSHAP's vari-
able capturing whether or not people experience pain
while walking, which had real values for most study par-
ticipants and offered a reasonable proxy for chronic pain
across a variety of common daily activities. The NSHAP
also contains two additional variables that capture pain
during other activities: sexual intercourse and getting up
from a sitting position. Our preliminary examination of
the NSHAP data, including exploratory factor analysis of
each measure's unique value for modeling QoL con-
structs, suggested that "pain while walking" offered the
best insight into our outcomes of interest. In addition,
these other measures of pain were not available for a
large portion of cases. The binary "pain while walking"
variable thus provided the best means of modeling the
potential mediating impact of persistent pain on rela-
tionships between inflammation and QoL.
We operationalized diagnosis status via a single vari-
able in the NSHAP that captures whether or not people
have ever been diagnosed with a chronic condition. The
dataset also captures information about 18 specific types
of chronic conditions, including three that may include
inflammatory pathology (asthma, gastrointestinal dis-
ease, and arthritis). However, we did not use these vari-
ables for two specific reasons. First, they only capture a
small subset of the complete spectrum of health condi-
tions that involve chronic inflammation. Second, they
may capture conditions that are not inflammatory in na-
ture, such as gastric ulceration or bowel perforation.
The binary "any chronic condition" variable thus pro-
vided an ideal means of exploring the general mediation
potential of a clinical diagnosis.
We used logistic regression to explore possible medi-
ation relationships between chronic inflammation, its
common medical sequelae, and two different types of
QoL. For each QoL outcome, we first computed bivariate
Nowakowski et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2016) 14:46 Page 4 of 10
ordinal logistic models of the relationships between in-
flammation and QoL. We also generated bivariate ordinal
and binary logistic models of associations between inflam-
mation and each of its common sequelae, as well as bivari-
ate ordinal logistic models using each suspected mediator
to predict each QoL outcome. Next, we incorporated each
of the three potential mediators into bivariate ordinal
models of inflammation and QoL. For each outcome vari-
able we computed trivariate models incorporating sus-
pected mediators in isolation, as well as more complex
models using all three sequelae as an aggregated block.
We assessed potential effect mediation using Sobel-
Goodman tests on a series of companion models com-
puted using OLS regression. Although allowed by some
statistical software packages including the one we used,
performing these tests on ordinal logistic models is
widely viewed to be theoretically inappropriate. Perform-
ing these procedures instead on the companion OLS
models we computed, which yielded substantively identi-
cal results to our original ordinal logistic ones, allowed
us to examine the plausibility of a mediation effect from
common medical sequelae of chronic inflammation, as
well as the apparent proportion of the predictor's total
effects mediated by the intervening variables.
To guard against reporting results that were merely ar-
tifacts of our specific modeling framework and testing
strategy, we also performed a series of sensitivity ana-
lyses. First, we computed regressions for all hypothesized
models using structural equation modeling with boot-
strap standard errors and compared results to those
obtained from ordinal logistic and OLS models. Com-
paring results across these different modeling frame-
works allowed us to achieve reasonable confidence in
the findings from our ordinal logistic regressions and
companion OLS models. Second, we compared our re-
sults from purely cross-sectional modeling to those ob-
tained with a variety of different limited-longitudinal
modeling specifications, finding results to be substan-
tively equivalent. Specifically, we used CRP serolevels
from Wave I; measures of disease sequelae at Waves I
and II as appropriate; and measures of QoL components
at Wave II. This allowed us to compute longitudinal bi-
variate models for each component pathway in the over-
all mediation analysis, and limited-longitudinal
expanded models for the full framework, to which we
then compared our models using only Wave I data.
Finally, we computed a set of models incorporating in-
formation about a variety of other factors that can lead
to social disadvantage. Specifically, we included data on
sampled NSHAP participants' age in years, sex identity,
ethnoracial background, and educational attainment in
years. While the idea of "controlling" for such factors is
more abstract than concrete, including information
about social status and position can afford meaningful
insight about potential confounding of overall associa-
tions between inflammation and QoL. Moreover, incorp-
orating structural covariates can illuminate possible
fundamental causation of chronic inflammation by social
disadvantage, a process in which medical sociologists
have increasingly taken interest [49, 54, 55]. We present
models that frame social structural disadvantage as a
fundamental cause of chronic inflammation because the
literature increasingly supports this perspective.
For all ordinal logistic models, we performed Brant
tests to ensure that parallel regression assumptions were
fully met. No models yielded significant results on these
tests, indicating that all models satisfied the basic as-
sumption that the odds of moving between any two suc-
cessive contiguous categories were roughly equivalent
across all levels of each outcome. Diagnostic tests were
not performed on binary logistic models because parallel
regression is not an issue for outcome variables with
only two possible values.
After computing preliminary models for every ana-
lyzed pathway, we ran sensitivity analyses incorporating
data completeness elements and survey design variables
from the NSHAP. This allowed us to account for the po-
tential influences of participant non-response and data
clustering. We ran models incorporating the survey
weighting variables and compared results with those
obtained from our initial regressions. To assess the po-
tential impact of missing data, we also ran a series of
sensitivity analyses using complete case samples (versus
the small variations in sample sizes that appeared with
each bivariate model in the hypothesized mediation
pathway). Because these analyses either left our results
substantively unchanged or slightly improved the signifi-
cance of parameter estimates, we present unadjusted re-
sults for ease of interpretation.
This research study was performed in accordance with
the principles for protecting data on human participants
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved
by the Florida State University Human Subjects Commit-
tee on June 23, 2014 with reference number 2014.12860.
This approval was renewed on March 31, 2015 with refer-
ence number 2015.15273. Our study used only secondary
data obtained from Waves I and II of the NSHAP. No
active data collection with human participants was con-
ducted at any point during our research process. Conse-
quently, we have no consent documents of our own to
share. All uses of data for this research fell within the
scope of accepted activity for approved NSHAP data
users. No individual NSHAP participant data are reported
in this manuscript.
Results
We began by assessing the ability of inflammatory bio-
marker levels to predict each of the suspected mediating

constructs (i.e., disability, pain, and diagnosis). Table 2
shows results from bivariate logistic regressions of each
hypothesized mediator on CRP serolevels. In developing
each model, we computed odds ratios for the relevant
indicator. As Table 2 shows, we found reliable prelimin-
ary evidence to suggest pain, disability, and diagnosis
could serve as mediators of the overall association be-
tween chronic inflammation and QoL. Specifically, CRP
serolevels demonstrated significant ability to predict at
least one indicator of each variable. These results were
observed in both raw examination of CRP parameter sig-
nificance attenuation by the hypothesized mediators,
and Sobel-Goodman testing (via companion models) of
the purported mediation effects.
For disability, we found that each additional milligram
per liter of CRP was associated with 18 % greater odds
of experiencing high levels of functional impairment.
This association is significant with a p-value less than
0.001. For pain, we found that each additional milligram
per liter of CRP was associated with 17 % greater odds
of experiencing chronic pain while walking. This associ-
ation is also significant with a p-value less than 0.001.
For diagnosis, we found that each additional milligram
per liter of CRP was associated with 18 % greater odds
of being diagnosed with any chronic condition. Once
again, this association is significant with a p-value less
than 0.001.
Next, we examined the potential ability of these socio-
medical variables to mediate overall associations be-
tween inflammatory biomarkers and QoL outcomes. We
did so by incorporating each of the sociomedical indica-
tors into models of QoL outcomes regressed on CRP
serolevels. This allowed us to assess the degree to which
sociomedical sequelae of chronic inflammation attenu-
ated the significance of CRP itself in predicting each
QoL indicator. Table 3 summarizes results from these
analyses. Each of the three types of sociomedical seque-
lae (i.e., disability, pain, diagnosis) attenuated the overall
predictive value of CRP for QoL outcomes associated
with inflammatory biomarker levels.
We also assessed component fit for each covariate
as well as whether or not these variables improved
the overall fit for each QoL outcome. We did so by
computing Bayes Information Criteria for initial
models (e.g., regressions of QoL outcomes on CRP
levels using only cases with real values on the included
covariate) and final models (e.g., regressions of QoL out-
comes on CRP levels and sociomedical sequelae). Each of
the three sociomedical sequelae significantly predicted
by inflammatory biomarker levels (disability, pain,
diagnosis) substantially improved the overall fit of
models for general happiness, but not for relationship
happiness. Modeling for the happiness outcome was
consistently and significantly improved by incorpor-
ation of all three sociomedical sequelae, whereas over-
all fit for regressions of the other outcome became
worse. These results mirrored our findings from
Sobel-Goodman testing on companion models of sin-
gle mediators in the pathway between CRP and each
form of QoL.
We then computed models for each QoL outcome in-
corporating the three common sequelae of chronic
inflammation as a block. Findings from integrated mod-
eling of all three variables support the idea that these
constructs may collectively mediate the relationship be-
tween chronic inflammation and QoL, but more in some
domains than in others. Incorporating sociomedical se-
quelae of chronic inflammation as a block reveals strong
mediation potential for a measure of overall happiness,
but virtually none for a measure of happiness with in-
timate relationships. Wald chi-square testing revealed
that adding the block of inflammation consequences
substantially depreciated model fit, as did overall model
likelihood testing for the expanded regression equation.
By contrast, fit tests for the expanded model regressing
overall happiness on CRP and the potential sequelae of
inflammation suggested superior predictive ability for
the more complex model.
Results from these analyses are shown in Table 4.
When happiness with life in general is modeled as the
outcome, two of the three common sequelae of inflam-
mation appear to play a mediating role. Disability ap-
pears to exert the strongest mediating influence,
followed by pain while walking. In fact, when modeled
together with pain and disability, diagnostic status does
not appear to exert an independent mediating influence.
Diagnosis with any chronic condition, however, is often
highly collinear with both pain and disability, which sug-
gests this finding does not necessarily mean that diagno-
sis does not independently influence the relationship.

Indeed, sensitivity analyses reveal a consistent relation-
ship between diagnosis with one or more chronic condi-
tions and decreased happiness with life.
Discussion
Our findings provide support for hypothesized relation-
ships between chronic inflammation, pain, disability,
diagnosis, and QoL. Specifically, our results reveal that
pain, disability, and diagnosis may individually and col-
lectively mediate associations between biologically-
demonstrated chronic inflammation and QoL. These
findings are consistent with evidence suggesting relevant
sequelae of chronic disease and the ways such constructs
may mediate relationships between health status and
QoL.
As suggested previously, research on how pain and dis-
ability impact QoL yields more consistent evidence con-
cerning the direction of influence. Specifically, sociologists
have found that functional impairment and chronic pain
generally reduce QoL in multiple domains [26]. Clinical sci-
entists have observed similar patterns among people with
many specific inflammatory conditions [23]. Considering
that sociologists explain these declines in QoL via changes
in health that threaten the integrity of people's relation-
ships with self and others [32], such findings reveal equal
relevance for sociomedical sequelae from specific chronic
conditions and consequences associated with broader ex-
perience of chronic disease.
Our findings also support evidence concerning medi-
ating impacts of diagnosis on the association between
health status and QoL. On the one hand, diagnosis with
any chronic condition is typically associated with at least
modest declines in QoL [56], but on the other, diagnosis
can confer important resources and support systems
[57]. The fact that diagnosis is not as strong or consist-
ent a mediator between chronic inflammation and QoL
may thus indicate that this variable exerts influence
through multiple pathways. People whose conditions
have been diagnosed may experience unhappiness and
grief, but may also experience relief from anxiety that
stems from reduced uncertainty about health and greater
ease communicating their illness experience [41]. Be-
cause we measured only diagnosis with any chronic con-
dition as opposed to specific diseases, findings may also

reflect that not all chronic conditions influence QoL in
the same ways.
Our findings for both the pain and disability variables
also illuminate relevant deficiencies of the sick role con-
cept as they relate to persistent inflammation. Non-
visible sequelae from inflammatory disease, such as
chronic pain, may cause the sympathy of friends and
loved ones to wane at greater speed [26]. This
phenomenon is likely mediated by the discrediting role
of invisible illness, which lacks social legitimacy [37].
Functional disability presents a different set of concerns,
especially when the impairment can be seen by others.
People who experience disability from chronic disease
may experience relative declines in social isolation if
their impairment becomes severe enough to demand
outside caregiving [58]. However, gains in social support
mediated by caregiving often occur outside the realm of
intimate partnerships [59]. In cases where partners do
become primary caregivers, partners experience high
risk of morbidity due to the role conflict and captivity
that can often result from providing care for an ailing
partner [58].
Taken together, these findings suggest that the mecha-
nisms by which the common sociomedical sequelae of
chronic inflammation may mediate the overall relation-
ship between inflammatory disease and QoL are highly
nuanced. Likewise, these mechanisms are often dynamic
and multifaceted in terms of directional influence: A
given medical consequence of chronic inflammation may
exert important positive and negative influences on QoL
synergistically. We therefore encourage caution in inter-
preting findings concerning the ability of these con-
structs to improve the overall fit of models relating
chronic inflammation to QoL. Non-significant improve-
ments in fit do not suggest that a given sociomedical se-
quelae variable confers no predictive value, but rather
that decomposing this variable into smaller elements
may be necessary to assess the different impacts it ex-
erts. We also note that happiness itself is a nuanced con-
cept, both within and outside of intimate relationships.
Our reviewers for the first draft of this manuscript
pointed out that experiential measures of happiness both
offer valuable insight and pose key limitations.
Indeed, we further urge caution interpreting our find-
ings due to several limitations in our measurements.
First, as noted above the two outcome measures are ex-
periential and reflect a relatively large time window of
12 months. As such, they do not necessarily reflect vari-
ations in daily experience or the complexity of happiness
as an emotion. Second, we also did not have access to a
complex overall measure of chronic pain. While the
"pain while walking" variable offered a reasonable proxy
given the community-dwelling and age-diverse makeup
of the NSHAP population, it did not capture nuances of
pain or its impact on daily activities. Third, as with any
biomarker, although we excluded missing measurements
and those with obvious errors, there may be some mildly
inaccurate estimates of participants' CRP values in the
analytic data stream. Although bias introduced by
small measurement errors is likely to be to the null
[30], we do note that our study mirrors other bio-
social analyses in the need for continued replication
and refinement of findings with varied data sources
and populations. Fourth, although extant literature
validates CRP as a general measure of chronic inflam-
mation, less is known about how well CRP predicts
the manifestation and severity of specific inflamma-
tory conditions. Care should thus be taken to further
refine such knowledge as biosocial research expands
in coming years.
We also note an additional key limitation in the study
design itself, albeit one that we cannot address at this
time given lack of available data. As previously noted, we
did not have three waves of data for use as only Waves I
and II of NSHAP are presently available. We are thus
unable to establish the full impact of mediation or pro-
vide panel design type conclusions. We certainly encour-
age fellow scholars to continue this research with
additional waves of NSHAP as they become available,
and to incorporate more robust uses of advanced longi-
tudinal modeling techniques and SEM frameworks using
appropriate software.
Despite these limitations, our study also presents some
important strengths other researchers may build on in
future research. First, our analyses focused on an older
age study population, which grants greater probability of
hypothesizing likely nuances and outcomes in the com-
ing years. Second, we were able to demonstrate some
longitudinal elements of mediation by utilizing two
waves of data throughout our analyses. Further, we pos-
sessed solid biosocial data on inflammation, which is ne-
cessary for teasing out nuances and influences along
biological, sociological, and psychological dimensions of
health and well being. Finally, the NSHAP is built upon
evidence-based inclusion and exclusion criteria, which is
necessary for accurate accounts of health and illness ex-
perience within and between populations. We would
thus argue that with the proper caution researchers may
build upon our strengths to further understand the com-
plexities of biosocial experiences of chronic conditions.
Conclusions
Taken together, our findings suggest that sociomedical
sequelae may indeed serve as mediators of the relation-
ship between chronic inflammation and QoL. However,
they also suggest that social pathways mediating the hy-
pothesized relationship between chronic inflammation
and QoL may differ fundamentally for emotional versus

relational outcomes. More broadly, our findings indicate
a need for more nuanced research on social mechanisms
that may mediate the effects of chronic inflammatory
disease across a variety of different dimensions of QoL.
Indeed, this interpretation mirrors robust evidence from
sociological literature on QoL measurement concerning
the importance of capturing multiple outcomes [60].
Findings also reflect potential nuances in the impact of
specific chronic conditions on QoL, and the diversity of
these experiences among people with different health
profiles and social locations.
Our analyses of disability, pain, and diagnosis as poten-
tial mediators of the relationship between chronic inflam-
mation and QoL recommend three tentative conclusions.
First, the overall association between chronic inflamma-
tion and QoL is likely to be mediated by sociomedical se-
quelae. Second, this apparent mediation is partial rather
than complete. Our findings suggest that chronic inflam-
mation generally exerts influences on QoL in excess of
those explained by disability, pain, and diagnosis. Third,
sociomedical sequelae appear to mediate the relationship
between chronic inflammation and emotional QoL more
strongly and consistently than that between inflammation
and relational QoL. Our findings suggest there may be
much to learn from potential mediators between chronic
disease experience and varied components associated with
overall QoL. We specifically recommend extending this
analytic framework across a variety of chronic inflamma-
tory conditions and associated biomarkers.
