Introduction
Phillips and Earle (2010) argue that while methodological
debates regarding the positionality of researcher engaged in
prison research has not been totally absent, such a focus still
remains largely neglected by those conducting research in
such setting. In their work, they draw attention to the meth-
odological and epistemological contours of prison research,
its complexities and how this offers an opportunity for an
empathic understanding of the lives of prisoners in their
study. The aim of this article is to share our connection to the
knowledge produced, which is shaped not merely by the
approach employed but how our individual biographies inter-
sect with that of the participants in our study (Stanley and
Wise, 1993). We share how Lizzi's, a White, married, middle-
class female (Junior Researcher), and Geraldine's (Principle
Investigator), a Black, unmarried, mother of working-class
African Caribbean descent (Senior Researcher), identities
became part and parcel of the research process. As in the
work of Phillips and Earle (2010), the suggestion here is not
that identities are fixed but aim to offer an insight that demon-
strates the methodological significance of our identities to the
study carried out. Letherby (2003, 2013) notes, there is much
that can be understood when researchers engage in a process
of reflexivity. As such, Letherby (2003, 2013) asserts that
reflexivity occupies a central role in `the doing'and in `under-
standing' what is done when researchers engage in social

Abstract
Within the social sciences, there is a wealth of literature that examines the challenges and ethical dilemmas encountered
by researchers in conceptualising, conducting and understanding their research. In this article, we share our reflections on
experiences we encountered carrying out a qualitative evaluation of a prison gardening intervention with male substance
misusing prisoners. Our aim is to suggest that there is much we can gain when researchers engage in a process of reflexivity,
which includes consideration to the intersection of identity of the researcher, the researched and the forces of various kinds,
operating upon and within such situations. As such, here we share our fieldwork experiences and shed light on how, for us,
the evaluation was a subjective, power-laden, emotional, embodied experience. We highlight how a human geographer and
a sociologist working as part of a multidisciplinary evaluation team encountered issues associated with choices in terms of
how we conduct our work, the emotional labour expended and how we had to assume both chosen and imposed identities.
We have been challenged to consider and reflect upon aspects of gender, class, age and professional status throughout our
research experience, with the `researched' and between the `researchers'. Finally, we suggest that embarking on qualitative
research in a prison setting is an outcome of complex negotiations, but in theorising our subjectivities is a means of illuminating
issues that often remain invisible within prison research.

research. This is because there are a myriad of ways in which
researchers are present and connected to the research they
undertake. This article illuminates the various ways in which
the researchers' identities, whether externally or internally
inscribed, intersect with the evaluation context, participants
and subject under investigation. Our article contributes to the
growing body of research which recognises the importance of
positionality in prison research.
Positionality
Over the past 12months, we (Lizzi and Geraldine) have been
part of a multidisciplinary team from Coventry University
evaluating a horticultural intervention (the Master Gardener
Programme (MGP)) at HM Prison Rye Hill (see Brown et al.,
2015). Over this period, we spent, in total, an estimated
152hours in the field engaging both formally and informally
with participants (and staff) on the MGP allowing us to spend
time working alongside participants, engage in conversations
with participants and staff and gaining an insight about other
parts of the prison estate (such as visiting the recovery wing,
industries and staff canteen). Consequently, there is a core eth-
nographic dimension to our evaluation in which we used a
variety of research tools to capture participants'experiences of
the MGP and over the evaluation period we collected a wide
range of data (detailed in the `Methodological approach' sec-
tion) month by month. As noted by Jewkes (2012), `a small
minority of ethnographers acknowledge the emotional content
of prison studies' (p. 63). Here, we argue that the knowledge
we produce is enhanced by having time to gain an understand-
ing of the context in which the evaluation was undertaken, get-
ting to know the participants and staff delivering the
programme was an insightful experience. Our approach ena-
bled us to situate ourselves in this process, which has meth-
odological and epistemological implications such as how
emotions, memory and subjectivities became entangled within
fieldwork encounters (Holland, 2007).
Working in a prison setting
The prison in which the research took place is a private training
prison which opened in 2001 and is run by G4S, a leading
global integrated security company (www.g4s.com). At the
start of the evaluation, the prison was designated as a category
`B'training prison holding 664 sentenced male adults. The sen-
tence requirement at HMP Rye Hill (2014) is for prisoners who
receivemorethan4yearswith18monthslefttoserve.However,
at the midpoint of the evaluation, the prison was designated as
one of eight prisons in England and Wales to undertake a re-
roll1 of its population, and since Spring 2014, the prison has
housed men incarcerated for a sex related offence. Today, the
prison remains a training prison with a capacity of 635 and acts
`as a national resource for sentenced male adults who have
been convicted of a current or previous sex offence(s)' (www.
hmpryehill.co.uk) and who have been sentenced to over 4years
and have at least 12months left to serve on their sentence.
The evaluation took place between August 2013 and
December 2014. At the start of our evaluation, the prison was
in the process of introducing a new approach to supporting
prisoners with a substance misuse issue. A key part of this
included the development of a recovery wing alongside a wider
suite of substance misuse programmes. In Phase 1 of our evalu-
ation, we spent 6months with a group of `mainstream' prison-
ers, and due to the re-roll of the prison to a vulnerable persons
(VP) population, Phase 2, the final 6months of the evaluation
was undertaken with sex offenders.All participants included in
our evaluation experienced substance misuse and were
recruited on the garden from the dedicated recovery wing; the
garden was part of a wider suite of programmes provided and
being developed by the substance misuse team.
As in the work of Phillips and Earle (2010), our field
notes, and the conversations we have had about our study,
reveal an aspect of the research that often remains hidden in
relation to how we felt about the MGP, participants, staff in
the prison setting and generally about our role in conducting
this study. Indeed, our notes and conversation often had an
emotional or subjective dimension. This enables us, like
Phillips and Earle, to focus attention on how factors such as
gender, `race' and class unravelled during the process and
our fieldwork experiences. However, our reflection here also
includes how perceptions associated with age and experience
also impacted fieldwork experiences:
Lizzi: I am a Senior Research Assistant with a research
background in human geography and 6
years' experi-
ence of working in the academy. I have worked on many
agri-food-related projects, including in the area of food
growing and the social and community aspect of this.
Prior to this evaluation, I had no experience of working
in prisons; my fieldwork experiences have involved
working with people around food growing spaces in the
United Kingdom and internationally. My part-time PhD
fieldwork focused particularly on food growing spaces
on housing estates and disadvantaged areas in London
where I critically sought to understand the broader
experiences and motivations of citizens from a critical
realist perspective. I am a White, British female from a
professional family. As someone who became disen-
gaged with school and particularly in subjects that did
not interest me, my need to work in a job that was mean-
ingful and captivating coupled with work experience at
a research institute gave me a concern for real world,
practical research which contributes towards `making
a difference'. The working-class area of the country
where I went to school comprised a host of socio-
economic issues which may have prompted my interest
in undertaking a human geography degree and MSc. in
urban regeneration research and policy. My Christian
faith (not one I grew up with) is central to my identity
and as such is of key importance to my reflections
around my research experience.
Brown and Bos 3
Geraldine: I am an experienced researcher (albeit quite
junior in the academic hierarchy), and I have been
involved in social research (initially as a Research
Assistant and now as a Research Fellow) for over 15years.
My academic background is in sociology and social pol-
icy, and the research I have conducted has largely focused
on exploring issues that have been identified as dispropor-
tionately negatively impacting groups identified within
UK policy as `excluded', `marginalised', `disadvantaged'
and more recently categorised as `vulnerable'. Hence, this
work has included research with teenage parents, Black
and minority ethnic communities, women, older people
and offenders. I am an unmarried mother from African
Caribbean descent and the first of my siblings to attend
Higher Education. I was born and grew up in inner city
Birmingham, which is one of the United Kingdom's larg-
est metropolitan cities. As a Black female researcher, I
often find myself navigating between two worlds ­ as a
Black woman working and researching in what remains a
White-dominated institution and as a woman who lives in
and is part of a wider Black community. This is challeng-
ing as I am continually reminded of how my background,
gender and racial identity mediate the research process in
diverse ways (Brown, 2015). As a Black feminist, there is
a political goal that underpins much of the research I have
undertaken in that my aim is to `allow space for groups
who are often absent from debates to be included', pro-
viding an opportunity to give voice to those who have
been silenced (Hill Collins, 1990: xiv). This reflects how
for me the personal is a political act (Mills, 1959). I hope
to undertake research that is not merely an attempt to gen-
erate new intellectual insights as while this is important,
fundamental to the research I undertake is for my work to
make a difference in the lives of those I engage in the
process (see Letherby and Bywaters, 2007).
Cohen and Taylor (1981) describe prison as places of
intensely managed emotions where institutional interests in
formal order coincide and conflict with the raw exigencies of
ontological survival in an alien and austere environment.
Consequently, the stress and anxiety imposed by closed and
crowded living conditions, and limited privacy have to be
endured daily by prisoners. It is therefore to be expected that
anxiety defences are mutually at play for both researchers
entering this world from the relative comforts of life outside
and prisoners themselves:
Lizzi: My previous personal and research experiences
undertaken had not prepared me for research in prisons. In
all honesty, I was quite apprehensive about going in to
this space and there was an element of fear in terms of not
being able to relate to the participants and a fear of being
`rejected'. However, as Geraldine was confident about the
process, I felt comfortable placing my trust in her.
Although I felt the need to `find a place' in this new
research environment as discussed by Warren (1988, cited
in Jewkes, 2012), working as part of a team made this
process somewhat easier. Warren suggests that finding `a
place' can be
tricky for the female ethnographer within a strange culture ...
because not only does she have to conform to assumptions about
women being unchallenging and compliant but she must also be
seen to be operating successfully in a male-dominated public
sphere. (Jewkes, 2012: 68)
Our gender was not a barrier to working with the partici-
pants, but for me age, or how I felt others perceived this, was.
I knew Geraldine would be great at working with the guys,
which comforted me but also made me question my ability.
However, being more reserved, introverted and somewhat
shy in an unfamiliar environment, I was nervous about not
knowing what would happen. Going into any unfamiliar set-
ting, in an intense manner (for the whole day in a confined
space) with a group of males (who I had never met before)
would have given me some degree of apprehension, of which
the `offender' status added to. The (un)predictability of the
participants was something I was initially cautious of, which
may have been to do with perceptions around their substance
misuse issues. The fact that we would be entering their space
as outsiders ­ in the whole sense of the meaning ­ outside to
the regime, outside of their cultural norms ­ meant that I did
not know how I should act, which perhaps reflected my level
of research experience generally (and did make me self-
reflect, recognising the importance of the experience for
researchers). As such, I can concur that as a `novice prison
researcher', I experienced anxiety about entering the field
although not with observing and talking to the participants on
a one-to-one basis, as Jewkes (2012) asserts. This is due to the
space of the garden and the methodological approach we took
in our evaluation, which moved beyond the formal researcher­
participant interview. I did, at the start of the visits, observe
Geraldine's behaviour and mirrored it to a certain extent ­
informally and somewhat unconsciously knowing what was
`acceptable' and the kind of things to ask, talk about, and so
on. I was surprised and comforted at how polite, welcoming,
warm, friendly and sensitive in tune with their emotions the
participants were, which made our prison visits enjoyable.
Geraldine and I became a familiar part of the garden space,
which allowed for a closeness to the participants (and the gar-
den) over a period of time.
I felt as though for me, prisons were a forgotten place and
prisoners were a forgotten people. I was never made to think
about prisons or prisoners and therefore I had a very limited
knowledge or connection to the prison system. I am reminded
of a friend ­ before the prison evaluation, Tom* who as well
as experiencing quite severe mental health problems, was
also tagged. Although this gave me a little insight and prepa-
ration for the prison, it enabled me to consider Tom's
circumstances and complex needs. This project along with

other events has taken me on a complex and unforgettable
journey shaping my inseparable personal (Christian) and
professional values:
Geraldine: I was excited about the opportunity of working
on this project. I have had some previous experience of
researching in a prison environment and also had some
personal experiences in terms of friends and family mem-
bers who had come to the attention of the UK Criminal
Justice System. At the point of starting this project, one of
my oldest friends was coming to the end of a 5-year prison
sentence and I had visited him on a number of occasions
so I had some understanding of the prison regime. This is
not to suggest that I was not initially nervous about doing
this work, but my nervousness was not associated with the
thought of working with prisoners. If I am honest, I was a
little more anxious about the relationship I would have
with those employed to work in the prison. Indeed, I
understand what Phillips (2010) means when she writes
about the marginalising experiences often reported in
accounts of empirical research carried out by Black and
minority and female researchers. Phillips accepts that this
undoubtedly holds epistemological value but simultane-
ously is evidence of how `race', gender and class remain
central to how individuals experience the social word.
Furthermore, fully aware that having some understanding
and knowledge about prison through knowing friends and
family members who had been incarcerated did not auto-
matically designate me as an insider. Like Lizzi, I too rec-
ognised my outsider identity. However, being an outsider
for me as a Black woman working in the Academy is not
unusual. There are numerous occasions that working in
the academy, for me, equates to feelings like being a body
out of place (Mirza, 2006) as I am often required to enter
places and spaces in which my racial identity positions
me as an outsider. For me, my anxiety similar to that noted
by Phillips (Phillips and Earle, 2010) related to the uneas-
iness I perceived I would encounter from those working
within the institution in which I would be undertaking this
work.
I was aware that Jane was apprehensive at the start of the
project as she had spoken to me about her feelings prior to
starting. I had tried to reassure her that we were a team and we
would conduct the data collection together. As a Principal
Investigator (PI), I explained that I was responsible for ensur-
ing her safety and that meant she would not be expected to
work alone with prisoners, we would ensure that we had
opportunity to share how we were feeling about the work and
she could talk to me about any concerns she may have; I
would support her in any way I could. The first fieldwork date
was set by the commissioners while I was on annual leave. I
had tried to get the date changed or suggested that another
senior member of the team attend the meeting, but was told in
no uncertain terms that as I was PI on the project it was
preferred that I attend the initial meeting with the evaluation
participants. Despite explaining that I would be in Singapore
and returning to the United Kingdom the morning of the visit,
the date remained the same alongside the expectation that I
attend.After a 13-hour flight, I jumped on a train from London
Heathrow to Coventry and was picked up by a member of the
team and driven to the prison to conduct the research team's
introduction to participants and participants' introduction to
the evaluation. On reflection, it is possible to see the very
insistence that I attend and my acquiescence to this request as
an example of an internal fear and how our own racial posi-
tioning (and awareness thereof) informs how we make sense
of and react in certain situations (Rollock, 2012).
Methodological approach
The decision to primarily adopt a number of qualitative
methods for our evaluation of the MGP is in acknowledge-
ment of the limitations associated with research designed to
uncover fixed patterns. A mixed-method approach drawing
on a range of qualitative tools is a recognition that human
behaviour is complex and fluid, and there are factors that are
often overlooked in research that primarily focuses on
uncovering fixed patterns alone. As we detail below, while
the aim of the MGP was to work with substance misusing
offenders, these prisoners were diverse in terms of age, eth-
nicity, drugs used, educational background, length of offence
and offences perpetrated. As such, it was decided that an
appropriate way of understanding the relationship between
the MGP and its impact was to design an evaluation that was
flexible and focus on the process, capture small scale situa-
tions, stresses, diversity and variability in terms of the range
of perspectives held by participants engaging in the pro-
gramme and key stakeholders involved. However, while the
primary approach to the evaluation rested on using a range of
qualitative methods, the evaluation was also informed by a
survey administered to staff working at the prison but who
had no direct input to the gardening intervention. Data were
also collected from participants' families in survey form and
in addition, the research team carried out an analysis of data
that were routinely collected by the prison. Demographic
data were also collected from participants via a short survey.
Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the type and amount of data col-
lected during Phases 1 and 2 of the evaluation from pro-
gramme participants and programme-related personal (see
Table 3 in Appendix 1 for a description of the tools used).
Phase 1 data were collected from September 2013 to March
2014 and Phase 2 from August 2014 to December 2014.
Therefore, in total, the research team has
·
· Spent around 152
hours conducting participant
observations;
·
· Facilitated three focus groups;
·
· Conducted seven staff interviews;
·
· Collected 50 completed staff feedback forms;

· Gathered 58 completed reflective diaries, 46 com-
pleted circles of change, 25 demographic surveys;

Reflexivity: understanding the
relationship between self and `others'
Phillips and Earle (2010) argue that the attraction of reflex-
ivity lies not in confessional or testimonial exhortation but
in its capacity to acknowledge researchers as active partici-
pants whose identities, like those of research subjects, may
be variously shaped by powerful hierarchies of race/ethnic-
ity, gender and class. Furthermore, consideration of such
dynamics enables us to see how our own positions and
interests are, sometimes discretely, imposed throughout the
research process, influencing the questions we ask, the ones
we do not, who we interview and who we do not, how we
interview, how we listen and how we do not and ultimately
how we understand (Hertz, 1997). For this reason, they
foresee reflexivity as providing a guide to sociological
practice somewhat immunized against `the single, central,
dominant ... quasi-divine, point of view that is all too eas-
ily adopted by observers' (Bourdieu, 1999: 3):
Lizzi: I was aware that on first impressions, I felt a dif-
ferent age and background from the group. This with
the mainstream prisoners was a point of conversation,
with them asking my age, where I was from, how I grew
up and where I did my food shopping. One of the guys
was curious about my upbringing and asked whether I
grew up on an estate; the same participant also asked
whether I shopped at Waitrose alluding to me being
posh (neither of which was true!). I welcomed this dis-
cussion as it allowed me to have some further social
interaction and facilitated a bond with the group.
Additionally, I was aware of how I feel others have
perceived me in the past, which I brought with me to the
prison project. I was conscious of my age, demeanour,
personality traits and professional position. Being more
of an introvert who prefers to `blend in' to group set-
tings contributed towards the anxiety I initially experi-
enced. One point to note is that upon reflection, it is
likely I would have felt anxious in any group setting at
first. I initially tried the approach of blending in which
was not too easy given the setting. I actively tried to
engage in group discussions by taking notes and show-
ing active listening skills ­ an acceptable tactic in the
academe. However, this opened the perception of me as
someone in authority quietly observing, watching and
assessing. Although I was observing and watching, this
was my role during the visits ­ a subordinate role to
Geraldine's which involved the more challenging task
of facilitating the group, ensuring data were collected as
well as their engagement with the evaluation. This made
me further reflect on myself, and my behaviour and
actually made me laugh as the perceptions of the par-
ticipants was quite opposite to my reality. It forced me
to question my positionality.
This sense of power the participants instilled in me was
not something I had experienced before and made me feel
uncomfortable. This experience was more apparent when
supporting Geraldine with a focus group as part of another
project (due to the absence of one of the research teams on
the project). I was the only White person in the room and the
only female apart from Geraldine; my role was to note-take
and to ensure we obtained completed consent forms. I took
my place around the table, tried my strategy of blending in
through keeping quiet and making notes (as I had limited
overview of the project and experiences of participants).
This however triggered the participants to question my posi-
tion, asking whether I was Geraldine's boss. Again, this per-
ception of me, being so far from my reality where I have felt

junior, young and inexperienced, not only made me feel
extremely awkward but also led me to consider my position-
ality and how others perceive me (which may be the opposite
to how I perceive myself) and the `power' I have.
I was also consciously aware of my appearance, with
some participants stating I look younger than I am, some-
times making me feel less capable of my job role, or that my
capability was being questioned. Upon reflection, I attended
the first visit dressed in a quite masculine way ­ wearing
trousers, limited make up and my hair tied back in a low bun
(which is uncommon for me). Over time, my comfortable-
ness with being a female was apparent in being more relaxed
by dressing and looking how I would normally would, and
even wearing my hair down on one occasion. Like Adams
(2000), my presentation of self is something that raised
doubts about `authenticity and integrity, as she feared pre-
senting an "unreal" or "false" self' (Adams, 2000, cited in
Jewkes, 2012: 67). Being married was one aspect of my
identity which was not a point of discussion (although it was
mentioned by Geraldine) despite my visible wedding ring;
perhaps, this subject was perceived as `too personal'?
Geraldine openly talked about where she was from and being
a mother, allowing this to be an area of discussion. This made
me consider what information was appropriate to share.
Finally, I soon realised that while it is important to consider
and reflect on the above, for me, regarding the participants as
`people' and listening to their experiences was central.
Overall, trying to blend in actually created barriers (internal
and external) and can be perceived as pretentious, as such
`finding a place' even before entering the research environ-
ment is important:
Geraldine: The majority of those recruited to the interven-
tion identified themselves as White European, hence, of
the 25 participants engaged in the intervention, only three
respondents identified as non-White. What became clear
during the study is how perception held by some of the
participants in regard to my racial identity in this setting
helped to facilitate positive relationships with prisoners.
Participants were often keen to share information about
their families, life prior to entering prison and life in
prison. In addition, in Phase 1, participants spoke can-
didly about their substance misuse both inside and outside
prison. Rarely did they refuse to answer questions asked,
there were occasions in which participants would share
things they had written additional too what we asked them
to do. I felt that my racial identity provided me with a
proxy insider status; during one visit, I was told that I was
`real' that I was `O.K.' and that they trusted me.
In this setting, notions associated with my racial identity
were perceived by participants as signalling that I would
have an understanding of their experiences and that I shared
a connection. Hence, engagement was problem free.
Alongside this, the fact that I spoke with a recognisable local
dialect, turned up in jeans, lived in the same city of some of
the participants on the programme or grew up in an inner city
area that shared familiar characteristics to that in which some
participants had lived prior to their sentence likely added to
my acceptance. It appeared that I challenged their perception
or the ideas they had about being an academic. This sense of
familiarity was something I also experienced and I remember
feeling a sense of acceptance and warmth towards partici-
pants. I was aware of how my personal experiences of sup-
porting friends and family who had come to the attention of
the criminal justice system lent itself to seeing beyond the
offender label to the person underneath. Bourne (1983) notes
that respondents and researchers can experience a kaleido-
scope of emotions during the course of a research project and
lists emotions such as laughter, tears, love hate, happiness,
longing, fear grief and loss are all feelings that we may
encounter and observe in others when we undertake research.
Furthermore, not only is a range of emotions experienced
during the course of a project but we may also experience in
a single interview (Bourne, 1983: 89). I experienced and
observed a range of emotions in the field. I was conscious of
how an aspect of our evaluation allowed for the humanisa-
tion of prisoners. I was conscious that I wanted them to know
that I did not share the judgemental attitude that is often asso-
ciated with those awarded with the offender label. This is not
to suggest that this did not pose some challenges during
Phase 2 of the project that led to multiple conversations with
colleagues.
Phillips and Earle (2010) argue that this sense of empathy
can be viewed as represented a sense of working-class align-
ment in which there is an emotional recognition of shared
class heritage. This is in conjunction with perceptions held
that being Black, I was working from an informed position
through having experience of criminal justice system and
drugs. To participants, my primary identity, irrespective of
that I was the PI on the project, was not related to my position
within the academy but the subordinate position that per-
ceived I held in wider society. For them, it was Lizzi they
initially identified as the `boss' or indeed any other member
of the team that accompanied me on a visit. Rollock (2012)
argues that an explanation rests in how it has been argued that
racialised Others occupy a liminal space of alterity; a position
at the edges of society from which their identities and experi-
ences are constructed irrespective of class. However, it is also
possible to understand the engagement of participants as
reflecting how they viewed the work we were carrying out
and how they welcomed the opportunity to contribute to pro-
viding an evidence base that would support sustaining the
MGP at the prison and its expansion to other prison setting.
As such, it is possible to see that engagement was also facili-
tated by participants and the researchers having a shared goal
in wanting a smooth execution of the evaluation to elicit evi-
dence that demonstrated the wider range of health, social and
educational benefits they identified from being involved,
which superseded certain notions of difference.

Final reflections
In writing this article, we attempt to make visible how as
researchers we are rarely neutral, objective bystanders in the
work we undertake. In so doing, we want to add our voices
that of researchers working in secure settings as a way of
showing as noted by Amanda Coffey (1999) that
Fieldwork is personal, emotional and identity work. The
construction and production of self and identity occurs both
during and after the fieldwork. In writing, remembering and
representing our fieldwork experiences we are involved in
process of self-presentation and identity construction. In
considering and exploring the intimate relations between the
field, significant other and the private self we are able to
understand the processes of fieldwork as practical, intellectual
and emotional accomplishments. (p. 1)
Lizzi: The experience of working with a senior Black
researcher has given me insight into considerations of
`race', class and age in the research environment, both in
terms of professional and participant interactions. While
Geraldine has been forced to reflect on `race', class and
gender throughout her professional life, I, on the other
contrary, have never really been forced to question my
whiteness (and power that goes with it) until this research
experience, demonstrating one of the advantages of
being part of a multidisciplinary team. While this experi-
ence has been uncomfortable at times, with participants
trying to `work me out', it has enabled and challenged
me to have a greater understanding of my own position-
ality and how aspects of my (self-constructed) identity
(and others), and how others perceive me, implicitly
shape and are fundamental to the research process.
Geraldine: Situating ourselves in the research process
highlights some of the methodological and epistemologi-
cal challenges encountered when engaged in research. It is
possible to suggest that in relation to Lizzi, I was in a privi-
leged position and my identity as a Black African
Caribbean woman not only helped to facilitate access to
my participants but also provided an insight that enabled
me to explicate stories that can be hidden when research-
ing in a prison setting. Yet, as noted by Phillips and Earle
(2010), this is not to suggest that this is always the case.As
someone with over 15
years' research experience, I am
also aware of the emotional labour one may encounter
when engaged in social research (Hochschild, [1983]
2003). Yet, the emotional work experienced during this
journey cannot be under stated conversations about sui-
cide, death, abuse and self-harm. The emotional work
experienced was in part my reaction to the stories recounted
and I acknowledge that none can ever be truly an insider
(Naples, 1996) and can never share or understand all par-
ticipants' views and experiences. Nonetheless, it was a
reminder of why it is important to challenge the dehuman-
ising stereotypes often associated with prisoners.
Our evaluation would be very different if we had
decided to remain invisible or taken a position with the
expectation that we remained the `objective'. Embarking
on qualitative research with ethnographic dimensions in a
prison setting is an outcome of complex (re)negotiations
but in theorising our subjectivities (Letherby, 2013) is a
means of illuminating issues that often remain invisible
within prison research.

Table 3. Research tools.
Participant observation. The purpose of participant observations is to observe the delivery of the Master Gardener scheme in a prison
setting and to capture first-hand participants' views, behaviour and interactions.
Semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews allow the research team to explore issues arising from participant observations and
other methods used.
Focus groups. Focus groups were conducted with staff working in the Substance Misuse Team and participants.
Portfolio of work. As part of the gardening intervention, participants are required to complete a work-based portfolio. The portfolio
contains information related to personal development ­ practical, factual and transferable skills learnt or developed as part of the
gardening programme worksheets ­ record of skills covered as part of the gardening intervention, motivation and expectation in relation
to involvement in the gardening intervention and to also include some biographical information.
Reflective diaries. On a monthly basis, participants were asked to complete a reflective diary. The diary is designed to capture individual
participants' feelings and experiences about being on the programme. Participants were asked to consider sharing their experiences,
feelings, what they feel has changed over the month, and generally capture their perceptions about the gardening intervention.
Circle of change. On a monthly basis, participants were asked to record their perceptions about how they feel the programme has
encouraged and/or supported them to make changes in areas of their lives.
Prison data. This is information that is routinely captured as part of the prison management regime; these data include adjudications,
earned privilege level and category.
Demographic survey. A one-off survey used as a way to gather socio-economic data when participants in the programme consent to take
part in the evaluation.
Staff survey uses as a way of gaining an insight as to the perceptions of changes observed by members of staff not directly involved in
the Master Gardening Programme but who may come into contact with participants as part of their roles, on a bi-monthly basis a short
survey is administered to a random selection of staff.
Family survey used as a way of gaining an insight as to the perceptions of changes observed by participants' family members a short survey
was administered to family members attending a family event as part of the Master Gardener Programme.
