Objectives. This research examines how the trajectories of self-rated health evolve among elderly Japanese individuals
and how socioeconomic status (SES), social relations, and baseline health differentiate these trajectories.
Methods. Data came from a five-wave panel study of a national sample of 2,200 Japanese old adults between 1987 and
1999. Hierarchical linear models and cluster analysis were employed to depict major patterns of temporal changes in self-
rated health.
Results. Overall perceived health becomes worse, but only slightly, between ages 60 and 85, whereas it appears to
improve a little bit after age 85. Underlying the observed age norm are four subtrajectories including constant good health,
early onset of perceived health decline, late onset of perceived health decline, and a course of recovery from poor self-
assessed health.
Discussion. Diverse subjective health trajectories exist in old age, extending well into the 90s. Prior observations of the
effects of SES, social relations, and baseline health on health states and transitions can now be extended to trajectories of
subjective health. Our analysis of Japanese data provides important benchmarks for comparisons with observations made
in other developed nations.
SUBJECTIVE ratings of health have been a focus of intense
research in gerontology for decades (Maddox & Douglas,
1973). They not only correlate cross-sectionally with diseases,
functional status, and mental health but also predict mortality
prospectively. Furthermore, people with perceived poor health
make more outpatient visits and use more hospital services
(Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Idler, Hudson, & Leventhal, 1999).
Consequently, self-ratings have often been regarded as a valid
indicator of health status (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999).
Empirical findings concerning how subjective health changes
with age are, however, very mixed. First, self-assessed health
has exhibited considerable stability over periods ranging from 2
to 15 years (Idler, 1993). Second, older people are more likely
than the young to rate their health as excellent or very good at
any given level of chronic conditions or functional disability
(Ferraro, 1980). For instance, Idler (1993) observed a ``linear,
positive association of age with better self-assessed health'' (p.
S297). Third, perceived health worsens with age except at the
advanced ages (i.e., 70 and older) (Hoeymans, Feskens, Van
den Bos, & Kromhout, 1997). Finally, according to recent
meta-analyses, subjective health declines with age, but this
decrement is greater in the old­old (75þ years) than the young­
old (60­75 years) samples (Pinquart, 2001).
Research on subjective health could benefit significantly by
adapting a life course perspective (Clipp, Pavalko, & Elder,
1992; Crosnoe & Elder, 2002). This requires an examination of
the shape of intrapersonal changes or trajectories (i.e., intercept
and rate of change) over an extended period of time. In addition
to the age norm or aggregated health trajectory for the total
population, one needs to ascertain the increasing heterogeneity
of health changes in old age (Nelson & Dannefer, 1992). For
instance, some individuals have shown little health decrement
until very late in life, whereas others have begun to show
marked impairment in middle age (Rowe & Kahn, 1987).
Individuals may vary not only in the initial state but also in the
timing, duration, and ultimate level attained for a given at-
tribute. As a result, temporal variation in subjective health is
best understood as a number of distinct trajectories, whereas
their average constitutes the age norm.
Existing studies have yielded only limited information
regarding interpersonal variation in trajectories of subjective
health. In cross-sectional studies of health states at one point in
time (e.g., Ferraro & Feller, 1996), intrapersonal change cannot
be distinguished from interpersonal differences. On the other
hand, some investigators have examined transitions in self-rated
health between two points in time by using an autoregressive
or residual change model (e.g., Hoeymans et al., 1997; Idler,
1993). This approach depends on the covariance matrix of
repeated observations of the same measures (e.g., subjective
health) over time, whereas the underlying growth curve or
trajectory is not analyzed (Rogosa, 1988). A more complete
understanding dictates an analysis of the initial level as well as
the rate of change with age.
This research aims to contribute to current knowledge in
three respects. We first offer quantitative estimates of the
growth parameters associated with the aggregated trajectory of
subjective health. Second, we delineate the multitude of sub-
trajectories underlying this age norm. Finally, we focus on the
effects of socioeconomic status (SES), social networks, and
baseline health status in differentiating subtrajectories of health.

To the best of our knowledge there has been no published
research that employs growth curve models in examining the
multiple trajectories of subjective health.
Japan provides a useful context for understanding how
subjective appraisal of health evolves in old age, particularly
in contrast with the United States. Similar in economic de-
velopment, both nations are experiencing rapid population
aging. However, with the highest life expectancy at birth in the
world, Japanese outlive Americans by 4­6 years (World Health
Organization, 2004). Psychological processes in Japanese
culture may differ significantly from those in European and
American cultures. In Western cultures, individual identity is
defined by personal choice and achievement, whereas in Japan,
a collectivistic model is assumed, emphasizing connections
with others, empathy, reciprocity, belongingness, loyalty, and
respect (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbet, 1998). Despite
these differences, findings concerning self-rated health among
older Japanese largely parallel those from the United States
(Fujita & Hatano, 1990; Haga et al., 1988; Liang et al., 2002).
As the vast majority of research on subjective health has been
conducted in the United States and other Western developed
nations, data from a non-Western country such as Japan would
provide valuable benchmarks for evaluating the external
validity of current research.
HYPOTHESES
We hypothesize that subjective health declines in old age,
with the decrement accelerating after age 75. Because the
prevalence of health problems accelerates as one ages, it is
more difficult to maintain good subjective health (Pinquart,
2001). Therefore, self-rated health is unlikely to evolve in
a linear fashion.
We also theorize that there exist multiple trajectories of self-
rated health. Although many physiologic variables show
substantial losses with advancing age, there is great variability
across individuals. Many people can be regarded as aging
successfully because they experience minimal physiologic loss
or none at all in old age. They should be differentiated from
those who show nonpathologic age-linked losses. The latter can
be designated as experiencing usual or normal aging (Rowe &
Kahn, 1987, 1998). Other investigators have distinguished
normal aging from pathologic aging, which is a result of
diseases (Kane, Ouslander & Abrass, 1999, pp. 4­7).
Accordingly, subjective health evolves along several path-
ways. Successful aging would suggest that self-rated health is
consistently good, stable, and characterized by only modest
decrement, if any, as one moves into the late 80s or early 90s.
In contrast, usual aging implies a similar course of subjective
health but with an onset of accelerated health decrement in the
mid or late 70s. Finally, an early onset of acceleration in
perceived poor health in the mid-60s would signify pathologic
aging (Liang et al., 2003b). The notions of usual and pathologic
aging parallel prior observations that self-assessed health
declines with age. However, investigators differ in their hy-
potheses regarding whether such decrements become more
accelerated or not in advanced ages (Hoeymans et al., 1997;
Pinquart, 2001). Other types of trajectories might also exist. For
instance, those with poor health initially may experience
significant improvement of perceived health because of re-
covery (Clipp et al., 1992). Idler (1993) also described a linear
trajectory of age-related improvement in self-rated health.
In addition, we aim to examine key factors that distinguish
among these trajectories. Current knowledge is based almost
exclusively on studies of health states at one point in time or
transitions between two points in time. It is presently unknown
whether the effects of these risk factors could be generalized to
health trajectories. Nevertheless, several hypotheses may be
advanced by extrapolating from current literature. Important
risk factors for differentiating subjective health trajectories may
include SES, social networks, and baseline health status.
House, Lepkowski, Kinney, Mero, Kessler, and Herzog
(1994) suggest that SES differences in health increase with
age until relatively late in life. According to the theory of
cumulative advantage, those with higher SES are more likely to
experience good health well into old age, whereas those
with lower SES are likely to experience significant health
decline (Ross & Wu, 1996). Health trajectories associated with
different SES diverge increasingly with age. Accordingly, we
hypothesize that persons with higher SES are less likely to
follow a course of accelerated health decline.
The quantity and quality of social relationships have been
widely recognized as risk factors of mortality and morbidity.
Prospective studies consistently show increased risk of death
among persons with a low quantity, and sometimes low quality,
of social relationships (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). We
hypothesize that those with strong social networks have
a greater probability to maintain good health into their late
80s. We recognize that health may affect social relationships as
well. In this research, we focus on the effects of social
relationships on health.
Given the extensive research on the linkages between
subjective and objective health measures (Ferraro & Farmer,
1999), we hypothesize that poor baseline physical health
conditions (i.e., disease, functional status) are significantly
associated with an accelerated decline in self-rated health.
Moreover, we postulate that poor baseline mental health (i.e.,
depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments) exerts
a similar effect, as there is substantial evidence that negative
emotions and cognitions can lead to poor health (Pinquart,
2001). Finally, we include gender as a control variable because
men and women differ significantly in self-rated health and
various risk factors (Liang et al., 2003a).
In our specifications, we focus on the effects of various
factors on health trajectories. Given the prospective nature of
our data (to be described later), the time sequence is well
defined. Theoretically, however, reciprocal causal linkages are
likely to exist. For instance, health trajectories may well in-
fluence one's employment status and income.
METHODS
Sample and Data
Data came from a five-wave panel study of older adults
in Japan. The baseline survey, conducted in November 1987,
involved a national probability sample of 2,200 Japanese
persons aged 60 and over. With a response rate of 69%, the
sample was found representative of the total elderly popula-
tion in Japan (Jay, Liang, Liu, & Sugisawa, 1993). After the
TRAJECTORIES OF SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH S225
baseline survey, except those deceased, all subjects were
followed up once every 3 years (i.e., in 1990, 1993, 1996, and
1999). Proxy interviews were obtained for those unable to
complete the survey themselves. In addition, a nonresponse
questionnaire was utilized to gather information in the case of
death or other reasons for nonparticipation. A significant
number of those who did not respond at a given wave were
recovered at a subsequent follow-up. Between waves 2 and 5,
the proportion of self-respondents ranged from 62% to 76%,
whereas proxy interviews varied from 7% to 13% and death
accounted for 8­14%. Accordingly, we were able to keep the
proportion of nonrespondents to , 10% of the total number of
subjects contacted at each follow-up (i.e., waves 2­5; Table 1).
Measures
As the dependent variable, self-rated health was assessed via
three indicators: (a) a rating of physical health (coded: excellent
[1]; fairly good [2]; average [3]; not very good [4]; and poor
[5]), (b) health comparisons with other people one's age (better
[1]; about the same [2]; and worse [3]), and (c) a report of
overall satisfaction with one's health (coded: very satisfied [1];
relatively well satisfied [2]; can't say [3]; not very satisfied
[4]; and not at all satisfied [5]). Health compared with others'
was scaled to reflect a 5-point scale, and then the three items
were summed to form a composite of perceived ill health,
with Cronbach alpha values ranging from .82 to .86 across
five waves.
Gender was defined as a dummy variable (1 ¼ female),
whereas SES was measured by education in terms of the total
number of years of schooling. In addition, marital status and
employment at the baseline were included as dummy variables
(1 ¼ married and 1 ¼ working, respectively). These can be
regarded as indicators of social networks. Because the time
sequence between these two measures and health trajectories
is well defined, we avoid the possibility of endogeneity in
causal inference.
With reference to baseline health conditions, cognitive
impairment was assessed using Pfeiffer's (1975) Short Portable
Mental Status Questionnaire. A count of the number of
incorrect responses across nine questions covering short- and
long-term memory, orientation to surroundings, knowledge of
current events, and ability to perform mathematical tasks was
obtained. Unanswered questions were counted as incorrect
(Fillenbaum, 1980). Depressive symptoms were represented by
seven items (a ¼ .807) drawn from the Center for Epidemi-
ological Studies­Depression scale (Radloff, 1977). These items
included the following: (a) appetite was poor, (b) sleep was
restless, (c) could not get going, (d) everything I did was an
effort, (e) felt depressed, (f) felt lonely, and (g) felt sad (coded:
most of the time [3]; sometimes [2]; and rarely [1]). The
selection of these items was based on findings that a brief form
taps the same symptom dimensions as does the original scale,
and reliability measures indicate little sacrifice of precision
(Kohout, Berkman, Evans, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1993).
Based on a checklist of conditions, an index of serious
conditions was generated by including diabetes, heart disease,
hypertension, and stroke, whereas the remaining conditions
were grouped to be chronic conditions, consisting of up to 13
types, including, for example, arthritis, eye disease, asthma, and
Parkinson disease. Serious and chronic conditions are measured
separately because there is some evidence that serious illnesses
have stronger relationships than chronic illnesses with mortal-
ity and self-rated health (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999). Finally,
functional status at baseline was assessed by a composite of six
items measuring difficulties with activities of daily living or
instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, climbing
stairs, walking a half mile, using the phone, shopping, and
traveling by bus, train, or subway) scored in the following
manner: no difficulty at all (0), slightly difficult (1), fairly
difficult (2), extremely difficult (3), and unable to do at all (4).
All mental and physical health covariates as well as the
dependent variable self-rated health status were coded to reflect
greater morbidity, impairment, or poor health. Table 2 presents
the descriptive statistics of all the baseline covariates.

Data Analysis
Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate parameters
associated with health trajectories (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).
In particular, individual health trajectories were modeled as
follows (Level 1 or repeated-observation model):
YiA
¼ p0i
þ p1i
A þ eiA
ð1Þ
where YiA
is self-rated health for Individual i at age A (at a given
survey); p0i
is the intercept of subjective health for individual i;
p1i
is the rate of change (slope) in self-rated health for
Individual i across age; and eiA
represents random error in self-
rated health for individual i at age A.
An important feature of Equation 1 is the assumption that the
intercept and growth parameters vary across individuals. Thus,
these parameters become dependent variables in the level 2 (or
person-level) model, where individual or group attributes can
be included as predictors. This is represented in the following
model for each of the individual growth parameters:
ppi
¼ bp0
þ
X
bpq
Xqi
þ rpi
ð2Þ
Here Xqi
is a covariate (e.g., gender and education) associated
with Individual i, and bpq
represents the effect of Xq on the pth
growth parameter (ppi
). rpi
is a random effect with a mean of 0.
For the sample as a whole, both linear and nonlinear changes
in self-rated health were considered. Linear change was eval-
uated by estimating Equation 1 as it appears above, whereas
nonlinear change was evaluated in a separate pass through the
data by adding one or more appropriate polynomial terms
(e.g., p2i
A2 for a quadratic age effect) to Equation 1. Age was
standardized (M ¼ 73.88, SD ¼ 7.31) to minimize the col-
linearity among various age-related effects (i.e., intercept, linear
and nonlinear effects).
To identify major patterns of self-rated health changes in
old age, K-means cluster analyses were used to create categories
of individuals with similar growth parameters from Equation 1
(i.e., p0i
þ p1i
). The goal was to choose a solution that used the
fewest number of clusters possible to identify distinctive and
meaningful subjective health trajectories. These trajectories were
then used as the dependent variable in a multinomial logistic
regression analysis assessing the effects of baseline covariates.
Finally, to validate the identified subtrajectories, they were in-
cluded in the level 2 equation in conjunction with various pre-
dictors in analyzing interpersonal differences in self-rated health.
Item Missing, Attrition, and Mortality
To minimize the loss of subjects due to item missing and
attrition, multiple imputation was undertaken. There was little
item missing at the baseline survey. Missing values on all
baseline measures were imputed by using data collected in
1987. Across waves 2­5, the proportion of cases with at least
one of the three self-rated health items missing ranged from
17% to 25% at each wave, with the vast majority containing
one or two missing items. Different procedures were followed
depending on the type of response. For those with proxy
interviews and those who did not respond at a given wave, we
imputed their missing values on subjective health by using
baseline data and prior observations of subjective health. For
those who died, self-rated health was imputed for the time
period between the previous wave of data collection and death.
Three complete data sets were imputed with the NORM
software developed by Schafer (1997), and analyses were run
on each of these three data sets. Parameter estimates and their
standard errors were derived by averaging across three
imputations and by adjusting for their variance.
FINDINGS
Age Norm of Self-Rated Health
We examined the aggregate trajectory of subjective health by
evaluating several progressively more complex (i.e., linear,
quadratic, and cubic) models and choosing the most appropriate
model on the basis of the statistical significance of various age-
related effects. For the sample as a whole, the age norm can be
best described by a cubic function (Table 3). In this function,
fixed effects associated with all growth parameter estimates
except the quadratic slope are statistically significant (i.e.,
intercept ¼ 7.86, p , .001; linear slope ¼ .55, p , .001; cubic
slope ¼ À.06, p , .05). Between ages 60 and 85, subjective
health becomes only slightly worse, ranging between 7.388 and
8.836 (Table 4; Figure 1). From age 85 to 95, it appears to
improve a little bit (i.e., from 8.836 to 8.503). To gauge how
much confidence one should give to the parameter estimates,
we present both the total age range and the effective age range
associated with all health trajectories in Table 3. Although the
total age range is from ages 60 to 102, the effective range is
between 60 and 95 where at least 20 observations at each age
are required.
Subtrajectories of Subjective Health
In addition to the age norm, we examined the heterogeneity
in subjective health changes. To accomplish this, the sta-
tistically significant random effects parameters (i.e., intercept
and linear slope associated with the aggregate trajectory in
Table 3) for all respondents were subsequently subject to K-
means cluster analyses. Because K-means cluster analysis
requires that the number of clusters be fixed a priori, it was re-
peated with different numbers of clusters selected (i.e., from 2
to 10). The goal was to choose the solution that involved the
fewest clusters possible to detect distinctive and theoretically
meaningful differences in health trajectories. The four-cluster
solution seems to fulfill this criterion best. Solutions involving
more than four clusters generally contain minor clusters, which
are very similar to each other. The four identified trajectories
are described in the following.
Constant good health. --Consisting of 899 respondents (41%
of the total sample), this trajectory has a positive quadratic age
effect (slope ¼ .20, p , .001) and a negative cubic age effect
(slope ¼ À.05, p , .01; see Table 3). It is characterized by
a somewhat higher level of perceived ill health (i.e., 7.769) at
age 60 and remains stable until age 90 (see Table 4; Figure 1).
Indeed, self-rated health improves (or perceived ill health
decreases) slightly between ages 60 and 75, whereas it becomes
a bit worse between 75 and 90 years. Although this trajectory
does not exhibit the best subjective health before age 80, it
appears to mirror what Clipp and associates (1992) termed as
a trajectory of ``constant good health,'' which is quite similar to
TRAJECTORIES OF SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH S227
``successful aging,'' as characterized by Rowe and Kahn (1987,
1998). Further discussion of our rationale will be presented later.
Early onset of worsening health. --This course is distin-
guished by a positive linear age effect (slope ¼ 2.08, p , .001)
and a negative cubic age effect (slope ¼ À.15, p , .01; see
Table 3). Older adults following this trajectory have better
initial self-rated health (i.e., 6.388 at age 60) than those with
consistent good health. However, from age 60 on, subjective
health begins to worsen steadily until age 85 (i.e., self-rated ill
health score: 12.363 in Table 4). Constituting 21% of the total
sample (N ¼ 452), this trajectory can be viewed as pathologic
aging because of the unusually early onset of accelerated
health decline.
Late onset of worsening health. --This trajectory (N ¼ 225 or
10%) has a positive linear age slope (2.92, p , .001), a positive
quadratic age slope (.23, p , .001), and a negative cubic age
slope (À.20, p , .05; see Table 3). After an initial period of
excellent health between ages 65 and 70, health begins to
deteriorate significantly thereafter (to an ill health score of
11.684 at age 90).
Recovery from poor health. --Finally, 270 respondents, or
10% of the total sample, had very poor perceived health
initially at age 65 (ill health score ¼ 12.302; see Table 4).
Interestingly, their perceived health improved substantially in
a linear fashion (slope ¼À1.48, p , .001) during the following
three decades (ill health score ¼ 6.987 at age 90; see Table 3).
Predictors of Subtrajectories of Subjective Health
Multinomial logistic regression analyses were employed to
evaluate the effects of key risk factors (Table 5). To control for
competing risk of mortality, the four identified subtrajectories
were analyzed in conjunction with two groups of individuals:
those who died between 1987 and 1990 (n ¼ 167) and between

1990 and 1993 (n ¼ 188). Because at least four repeated
observations are required to estimate a cubic function, those
who died before 1993 had to be excluded from the analysis of
growth curves. Within this context, early death can be
conceptualized as two distinct health trajectories different in
the timing of death.
In contrast to the trajectory of consistent good health, older
Japanese individuals with higher education have a significantly
lower risk of dying by 1990 (eb ¼ .894, p , .01), experiencing
recovery from poor health (eb ¼ .922, p , .05), or a late onset
of poor health (eb ¼ .922, p , .05). These results are generally
consistent with our hypothesis that higher SES is less likely to
be associated with more accelerated health decline. However,
education does not discriminate between those with consis-
tent good health and those experiencing an early onset of
poor health.
There is some evidence that social relations reduce the risk of
having a more accelerated health decline. Those who were
married at the baseline are significantly less likely to have an
early death by either 1990 or 1993 (eb ¼.564, p , .05; eb ¼.491,
p , .01) and to have a late onset of health decline (eb ¼ .487,
p , .05). In addition, employment at the baseline leads to
a significantly lower probability of dying by 1990 or 1993
(eb ¼.464, p , .01; eb ¼.508, p , .01) and recovery (eb ¼.431,
p , .01). Nevertheless, those who experience an early onset of
poor health do not differ from those with constant good health
in terms of marital status and employment.
There is strong evidence that poor baseline health leads to
either early death or a course of recovery. In comparison with
those who enjoyed constant good health, those who died before
1990 and those who recovered had more cognitive impairment,
depressive symptoms, serious and chronic conditions, and
functional impairment (Table 5). On the other hand, older
Japanese who experienced an early onset of poor self-rated
health had more serious conditions at the baseline (eb ¼ 1.392,
p , .01) than those with consistent good health. Finally,
somewhat paradoxically, those with more chronic conditions
(eb ¼ .659, p , .01) were less likely to experience a late onset
of poor health than consistent good health.
To what extent are the effects of SES, social relations, and
baseline health confounded by the competing risk of dying
before 1996? Ideally, the risk of dying was randomly dis-
tributed, and thus the estimated effects of various risk factors
would not be biased. However, as shown in Table 5, this is not
the case. Those who were female, had more education, were
married or employed, and had better health at the baseline were
significantly less likely to die. As a result, the effects of various
risk factors are likely to be somewhat understated because of
mortality. On the other hand, death during the periods of 1987­
1990 and 1990­1993 can be viewed as distinct health tra-
jectories themselves.
Interindividual Differences in Age Norm of
Subjective Health
We also examined interpersonal variations in the age norm of
self-rated health. If the identified subtrajectories of subjective
health are valid, then we can expect that they will all have
substantial and statistically significant effects on the growth
curve parameters. Indeed, there is strong evidence that this
is the case (Table 6). For instance, early onset of poor health
(b ¼ 3.24, p , .001) and recovery (b ¼ 3.61, p , .001) are both
associated with a higher initial level (i.e., intercept) of
perceived ill health, whereas late onset of poor health is
associated with significantly better subjective health (b ¼
À.1.60, p , .001). Furthermore, those experiencing early (b ¼
2.41, p , .001) and late (b ¼ 2.17, p , .001) onset of poor
health have a greater linear increment of ill health with age.
Finally, older Japanese persons who recover from poor health
experience a significant reduction in perceived ill health over
time (b ¼ À1.09, p , .001). After controlling for these
subtrajectories, none of the slope parameters is significantly
related to the baseline risk factors. This further suggests that
interpersonal variation in the curvature of the age norm is fully
explained by these subtrajectories.

TRAJECTORIES OF SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH S229
Nevertheless, the subtrajectories do not explain all inter-
personal differences. In particular, more depressive symptoms
(b ¼ .06, p , .05), serious conditions (b ¼ .32, p , .001),
chronic conditions (b ¼ .21, p , .001), and functional
limitations (b ¼ .09, p , .05) at the baseline lead to greater
initial level of perceived ill health. On the other hand, being
married at the baseline is associated with a relatively higher
level of ill health (b ¼ .23, p , .01). Furthermore, the random
effects associated with the intercept, linear, quadratic, and cubic
age slopes remain significant, even when all risk factors and
subtrajectories are taken into account.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
A major contribution of this research lies in its quantitative
depiction of the age norm of subjective health after age 60.
Subjective health worsens gradually, but only slightly, between
ages 65 and 85. Interestingly, subjective health improves a little
bit after age 85. This could be due to the fact that these
individuals were hardy survivors. This finding reinforces
previous observations that subjective health deteriorates until
advanced ages, where it becomes stabilized or even improved
(Ferraro & Feller, 1996; Hoeymans et al., 1997). In addition,
this research is among the first to trace the longer-term
trajectory of self-assessed health in older adults. It offers
valuable benchmarks for cross-validating previous findings.
Prior investigators focused only on the age norm of self-rated
health, and there was little understanding of its underlying
heterogeneity. This research explicates the considerable in-
terpersonal variations underlying the observed age norm of
subjective health. We identified four subtrajectories: (a) con-
stant good health, (b) early onset of poor health, (c) late onset of
ill health, and (d) a course of recovery.
How do these subtrajectories map onto the concepts of
successful, usual, and pathologic aging? ``Constant good
health,'' as described by Clipp and colleagues (1992), is quite
similar to ``successful aging'' characterized by Rowe and Kahn
(1987, 1998). However, prior investigators described this
trajectory qualitatively without providing quantitative estimates
of the parameters of the growth curve. Our decision about
labeling various trajectories is based on a comparison of all of
them between ages 60 and 90. What we have found is that those
with a trajectory of ``constant good health'' do not necessarily
have the best self-rated health in comparison with other
trajectories before age 80. What is unique about this trajectory
is that good subjective health is maintained well into the early
90s. Whereas further research is clearly needed, this also
suggests that the typologies developed by Clipp and colleagues
and Rowe and Kahn could be qualified with reference to the
changes in subjective health in old age.
In contrast, a late onset of perceived health decline seems to
correspond to usual aging, whereas those with an early onset of
perceived poor health mimic pathologic aging. Interestingly,
these two subtrajectories fit rather well with prior observations
that subjective health declines with age, and this decline is
greater in the old­old (75þ years) than the young­old (60­75
years) samples (Pinquart, 2001). However, these researchers
did not focus on the timing of the onset of decrement.
Why were those with more chronic conditions at the baseline
more likely to experience constant good subjective health rather
than a late onset of poor health (see Table 5)? Before age 80,
those with a late onset of poor health actually had better self-
rated health than those with constant good health (see Table 4
and Figure 1). More chronic illness at the baseline experienced
by older Japanese persons with constant good health may
explain this. On the other hand, changes in health conditions
after the baseline could be responsible for the late onset of
deteriorating subjective health. This suggests the need to include
not only baseline health conditions but also their changes as
predictors of how subjective health evolves in old age.
On the other hand, there was a small group of older Japanese
individuals (12% of the total sample) who had an elevated level
of perceived ill health at age 65 but experienced significant
improvement thereafter up to 90 years of age. This trajectory
appears to correspond well to the frequently observed linear
increment in positive assessment of health (Idler, 1993). As
poor baseline health led to either death or recovery, this group
shared many common determinants (i.e., poor baseline mental
and physical health) with those who died (see Table 5).
Nevertheless, how could one's self-rated health improve sig-
nificantly with age despite poor baseline health? There are at
least two possible explanations. First, these individuals might
indeed have experienced significant improvement in objective
health, thus leading to better perceived health. This is unlikely,
given recent findings reported by Liang, Shaw, and colleagues
(2003) that, on average, there is an accelerated increase in
functional limitations after age 60. No subgroup with
a significant improvement in functional status between ages
60 and 90 was observed.
Second, the increased health optimism could be explained by
psychological adaptation and social comparison (Hoeymans
et al., 1997; Idler, 1993; Piquart, 2001). Given sufficient time,
an individual may adapt to poor physical health and integrate it
into daily functioning, hence leading to improved self-rated
health. In addition to physical health, many assess health by
focusing more on what the body can do, on social role activities
they are capable of, or on emotional and spiritual well-being.
On the other hand, individuals often interpret health infor-
mation through a process of social comparison. People may
increasingly assess their health in reference to the conditions of
their age peers instead of their objective health (Borawski,
Kinney, & Kahana, 1996; Idler et al., 1999).
To analyze how various risk factors are linked with
trajectories of subjective health, we follow a person-centered
approach by focusing on distinct patterns of intraindividual
change (Crosnoe & Elder, 2002). The course of constant good
subjective health clearly differentiates itself from the trajectory
of recovery from poor health in terms of SES, social networks,
and baseline health. However, there is much less distinction in
risk factors between constant good health and health decline
with either an early or a late onset. On the other hand, relative
to those with constant good health, those who were married and
with higher education were less likely to follow a course of late-
onset perceived health decline. Although SES, social networks,
and baseline health have long been shown to be associated with
states of subjective health and their transitions, we provide new
evidence that these conclusions can now be generalized to
trajectories of self-assessed health.
In our analysis, the competing risk of dying was taken into
account when analyzing the probabilities associated with the
subtrajectories. In this regard, we differentiated those who died
LIANG ET AL.
S230
by 1990 from those who died by 1993. Our approach is rather
unique in that these two groups can also be viewed as represent-
ing two distinct health trajectories, and thus, we can examine
common as well as unique risk factors associated with them.
Nevertheless, these two groups shared virtually all risk factors.
In addition to those who died between 1987 and 1993, 447
respondents in our cohort deceased between 1993 and 1999.
These individuals were included in our analysis of health
trajectories for sufficient data (i.e., at least four repeated
observations) exist on them. One may question our decision
because these individuals were not grouped as a separate
trajectory, thus leading to an overestimation of those who
experienced various health trajectories. On the other hand,
excluding those who died between 1993 and 1999 from our
analyses may cause us to overlook essential details concerning
changes in self-rated health prior to death. To address this
concern, we replicated our analysis by treating those who died
between 1993 and 1999 as a separate group like those who died
before 1993. The results were nearly identical to those
presented earlier. Although the age norm follows a quadratic
instead of a cubic function, these two functional forms are very
similar because of a small cubic slope. More importantly, we
were able to identify the same four subtrajectories and, on them,
the similar effects exerted by the risk factors. Consequently, our
results are fairly robust regardless of whether those who died
between 1993 and 1999 were included in the analysis of health
trajectories or not.
In addition to the person-centered approach, we applied
a variable-centered approach, in which various risk factors are
included as predictors in conjunction with the four identified
subtrajectories. There is strong evidence supporting the validity
of the four trajectories derived from our cluster analysis, as they
are all significantly associated with the interpersonal differences
in the growth parameters associated with the age norm (see
Table 6). Further evidence is provided by the fact that these
four trajectories are associated with different predictors (see
Table 5).
Our research should be evaluated with reference to some of the
most important issues yet to be resolved. First, self-assessed
health is but one of the multiple dimensions of health and well-
being, including disease avoidance, sustained engagement in
life, and maintenance of cognitive and physical function
(Rowe and Kahn, 1987; Ryff, Singer, Love, & Essex, 1998;
Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). Further explication of the intra-
personal changes and stability is required for dimensions other
than self-rated health.
Our approach can be elaborated in several ways. For
instance, time-varying covariates could be incorporated in the
Level 1 equation (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). This may be one
way to address the reciprocal linkages that are likely to exist
between subjective health and its risk factors (e.g., work status).
On the other hand, there appear to be some differences in the
interpersonal variations (i.e., random effects) associated with
various subjective health trajectories (see Table 4). Further
research concerning their causes is certainly warranted.
More importantly, how multiple trajectories interface among
themselves over the life span is a very critical but unresolved
issue. Some researchers have used measures of life courses to
predict outcomes at one point in time (e.g., Crosnoe & Elder,
2002). Conceivably, this approach could be extended to using
trajectories of one kind to predict those of the other kind (for
a recent example, see McDonough & Berglund, 2003). Other
investigators have analyzed the linkages between trajectories by
applying latent growth curve models (George & Lynch, 2003;
McArdle & Anderson, 1990). However, because of the lack of
substantive theories, the causal order between the trajectories is
ambiguous, and strong assumptions are often required. A
partial solution involves the application of latent difference
scores, which imply a variety of dynamic age trajectories and
offer some means of comparing propositions (McArdle, 2001).
The present research entails a quantitative analysis of
interpersonal differences in intrapersonal changes of subjective
health. It would be extremely interesting to relate these
processes to higher levels of social structure such as family,
neighborhood, formal organizations, and cultures. An example
of such a specification would be a three-level hierarchical linear
model where interpersonal differences in intrapersonal change
and stability are nested within household units or birth cohorts.
This would also extend research concerning successful aging to
examine the effects of individual factors as well as features of
social structure.
Finally, to what degree could our findings be extended
to a non-Japanese population (e.g., American population)?
Because of the significant sociocultural difference, subjective
health trajectories among older Americans may differ sub-
stantially. For instance, Japan's population is more homoge-
neous than that in the United States, and it may be less useful in
making cross-national contrasts in terms of the impact of race
and ethnicity. On the other hand, class distinction does exist in
Japan, though it manifests in different ways. Further research is
clearly in order. Nevertheless, given that prior findings
concerning self-rated health among older Japanese largely
parallel those from the United States (Liang et al., 2002), our
results may offer some useful clues regarding how subjective
health changes among older Americans.
