Introduction
All children have stories to tell. But many are hampered in
their ability to write them down. The reasons for this may
include lack of confidence or practical skills, having
English as a second language, learning disabilities, or cul-
tural deficits. This difficulty in communicating through
written forms affects both the children's social develop-
ment and their academic attainment, with serious conse-
quences for prospects in adult life. The Write Here
collaborative project was designed to address the chal-
lenges children face as writers. It drew from Dorothy
Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert dramatic enquiry teach-
ing approach to allow a certain degree of learner flexibility
and creativity in exploring the process of writing, as
opposed to learning about different writing styles. Our
main goals included (a) testing how visual art, play, and
multimodal learning can help engage children with pur-
poseful, meaningful creative writing practices; (b) capital-
izing on this motivation to support the acquisition of
practical "nuts and bolts" writing skills; and (c) promoting
the engagement of young people with art galleries. The
project involved a professional writer working in residency
in both an art gallery and in schools, collaborating with a
gallery education officer and a lead schoolteacher, to
develop a sustainable body of practice designed to support
young people's confidence and skill in writing.
Context
The Teaching of Literacy
Writing is a complex set of practices which is far more than a set
of skills. (National Writing Project, 1989)
Over the past 50 years, different approaches to the teaching of
writing"havebeeninfluencedbythedebateoftheday"(Bearne,
Chamberlain, Cremin, & Mottram, 2011, p. 4). In the 1960s,
writing was regarded as a "creative" activity. By the mid-1970s,
the internationally renowned linguist Michael Halliday
(Halliday, 2002) emphasized the significance of social pro-
cesses for developing writing skills. In this view, children should
initiate the learning, and the teacher responds with support, but
not by direct teaching. By the early 1980s, Donald Graves's
(1983) initiative "Writer's Workshop" had pioneered what the
National Writing Project described as "the Horticultural model
of development" (p. 9). He identified the importance of what a
child brings to the writing process (including experiences and

Abstract
As political agendas change, the teaching of writing continues to evolve, encompassing different writing practices in an attempt
to address the perceived needs for literacy in our society. This article presents the Write Here project, which aims to boost
children's social development and literacy attainment through engagement with visual art, play, and multimodal learning,
delivered in both art gallery and classroom settings. The valuable knowledge gained at the end of this study was evaluated
and developed further through a series of extended collaborations between professional, postgraduate and undergraduate
writers, and schoolchildren and their teachers. Our findings suggest that engaging young learners with creative, playful,
multimodal activities will foster their confidence and motivation to engage with the subject and, more importantly, will lead
to a significant improvement in literacy attainment.

assumptions learned outside school) and the role of the teacher
as a fellow "writer." Since the 1990s, however, the establish-
ment of a National Curriculum and the work of the National
Strategies in the United Kingdom have led teachers to regard
writing as a set of skills, which need to be taught directly. In this
process, children work through each stage until they achieve a
finished product--that is, planning, drafting, revising, and edit-
ing before the final copy is made (Department for Education
and Employment, 1998). Since the turn of the century, writing
has remained at the top of the national educational agenda, for
two main reasons: (a) the much poorer results achieved by 10-
to 11-year-olds in writing, compared with reading, maths, and
science, at the end of Key Stage 2 Standard Assessment Tests
(SATs), and (b) the poor performance of boys in writing (Palmer
& Corbett, 2003). The implementation from autumn 2014 of the
New National Curriculum in England indicates how writing
remains a priority in schools today, and the subject of bitter
debate.
Key Practitioners
Before they can write, children need meaningful experiences to
write about, and opportunities to talk them through. (Palmer &
Corbett, 2003, p. 45)
Pie Corbett, the educational writer and poet, was an advisor
to the previous Labour Government (1997-2010). In 2008,
he introduced "Talk for Writing" (now common practice in
U.K. classrooms), at the heart of which lies children's talk
and discussion as a prerequisite to the writing process. He
has developed a multisensory approach to the teaching of
writing, to appeal to different learning styles. In this approach,
a new story with archetypal structure and tropes is read to the
class, who then cocreate a visual map of the story using a set
of visual symbols that have been learned. The story is then
told physically by the children in groups (using the map as
prompt) with performative symbols so the story becomes
embodied by the pupils. Subsequently, when writing the
story down as text, the children gradually substitute their
own individual words, characters, and actions into the origi-
nal story, making it their own. The "Talk for Writing" pro-
cess advocates strongly that the teacher should play a pivotal
role in modeling a scaffolded writing process to help the
child engage with "shared" given texts and encourage their
"guided" and then "independent" writing. This process
responds to Corbett's observation that children need to inter-
nalize language constructions through the "imitation" and
oral rehearsal of given texts, "acting out" the narrative in
class together, using visual maps or cues to build confidence.
When the words, structures, and phrases are sufficiently
embedded through this process, the children are in a position
to "substitute" their own ideas, and subsequently "innovate"
their own spoken and written narratives and nonfiction texts
with confidence. This method has been shown to be highly
effective, improving the quality of writing, and increasing
the child's motivation and engagement. This is especially
true for boys, for children using English as an additional lan-
guage, and for those with special educational needs (Corbett,
2008).
The importance of talk in laying the foundation for a writ-
ing process is also supported by Sue Palmer, a former pri-
mary head teacher, writer, and education consultant. Palmer
argues that human beings are not "hard-wired" for literacy,
whereas we are "hard-wired" for speech (Palmer, 2011). She
believes we are able to talk and articulate as we are exposed
to speech from birth. This is very different to reading and
writing, which have to be explicitly taught. However, liter-
acy is more than an agglomeration of speaking, listening, and
writing. Literacy affects the way people think, view, and con-
struct the world around them. Talking about one's experience
is essential to writing about it. Palmer introduces the "Two
Horses Before the Cart" model for writing, originating from
the assumption that writing without any talking is, "putting
the cart before the horse." In this approach, children are
required to use two different types of talk: talk for learning,
which gives them the opportunity to discuss the subject they
are going to write about; and talk for writing, which is a dis-
cussion of the reading and technical writing of a type of text.
Palmer has developed writing "skeletons" to support the
transference of talk into writing. These skeletons help to
organize and plan the writing process by using diagrammatic
representations and visual models, which can support even
very young children's thought processes.
Like Corbett, Palmer is offering children a range of tools
and methods of motivation for the job in hand. But there is
still debate among leading practitioners about the relation-
ship between--or prioritization of--"skills acquisition" and
"creativity" in developing young writers. Some studies sup-
port the view that writing skills need to be taught first
(Wilson, 2002), whereas others argue against establishing a
"crude checklist" to allow children to think like writers, to
become motivated, thoughtful, and creative in their endeav-
ors (Corbett, 2008).
This project adopted the "Talk for Writing" approach,
making use of the aforementioned individual and collabora-
tive processes, but also extending them into new practice to
explore greater detail in writing, and more varied degrees of
individual authorship of the archetypal story. The strategy
proposed by Corbett was particularly suitable for this study,
as so many children in participating schools (especially in
Mellers, which was the lead school) use English as a second
language, and this technique proved to benefit the pupils in
the past.
Multimodal Learning and Play
Children can, and need to, learn in a variety of different
ways. These have been described variously as "learning
styles," "multiple intelligences," or "personalized learning."
Individual learners may have preferences for a particular
Rumney et al. 3
sensory modality (e.g., visual, auditory, or kinesthetic) and,
as a result, may engage with the learning process more enthu-
siastically. However, recent scientific evidence suggests that
(notwithstanding the very important motivational benefits)
new knowledge is not necessarily processed more effectively
if young learners receive information according to their pre-
ferred learning style. This is due to the fact that although
visual, auditory, and kinesthetic information is indeed pro-
cessed in different parts of the brain, these parts are highly
interconnected (Coffield, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone,
2004; Dekker et al., 2012; Gilmore, McCarthy, & Spelke,
2007). Bearing the above in mind, this study adopts the term
multimodal learning, and bases its definition on Goodwin
(2005): "the engagement of all senses in interpreting differ-
ent parts of the story offers visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic
support to all the children--especially for those for whom
language and literacy are not easy" (p. xv). Multimodal here
embraces the social, verbal, and playful elements advocated
by practitioners alluded to above.
Play is as important to young children's linguistic devel-
opment as it is to their social and emotional development.
Play as formalized through drama, or as expressed through
visual mark making, offers opportunities to "explore the pos-
sible" socially and emotionally (Craft, 2000, p. 53). In 1978,
Lev Vygotsky argued that "It is incorrect to conceive of play
as activity without purpose . . . Creating an imaginary situa-
tion can be regarded as a means of developing abstract
thought" (p. 103). He also stated earlier that "in play a child
is always above his average age, above his daily behaviour;
in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself"
(Vygotsky, 1967, p. 16). Visual play and drama make a
child's imagination tangible and visceral. In terms of the per-
formative aspects of play, it can help children to interpret,
create, and communicate ideas. The Write Here project used
drama as "an emancipatory device that frees its participants
from the constraints of reality" (Aitken, 2013, p. 51). The
intention here was to enable young learners to inhabit a state
of metaxis, or in other words, a state of belonging to two
autonomous worlds at the same time, which is applicable to
performance studies when actors go in and out of character
(Kuksa and Childs 2014: 166). In this research, it refers to
dramatic role-taking by the young learners, to embrace mul-
tiple viewpoints and perspectives when exploring a particu-
lar issue or emotion. This ongoing awareness of both the
fictional world and the social reality of the classroom
strengthens the children's ability to reflect on the task, as
well as helping them to realize that there is a multitude of
possible solutions to a given problem classroom (Boal, 1995;
Edmiston, 2003).
Unfortunately, however, in mainstream education, such
use of "play" and "drama" is all too often left behind after
Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7), and abandoned all together by Key
Stage 2 (ages 7-11; or limited to occasional basic drama les-
sons and role-play). Even teachers who want to use drama as
a tool (for literacy or elsewhere across the curriculum) may
have had very limited exposure to drama techniques during
training. They may lack the confidence to use it, or may not
even value it is a thing "of itself." By its nature, drama
requires risk-taking, asks uncomfortable questions, and can
challenge hierarchy in the learning space; but it cannot be
forced to a predetermined conclusion, hence its potential for
use in fostering children's creative writing.
The discouragement of children to learn through play,
after a certain age, is mirrored by a long-standing and reduc-
tive tendency in the subject of visual art. Here, pupils aged 7
and above are suddenly required to "represent" the world lit-
erally, as opposed to being able to "interpret" it more
abstractly, which was deemed more acceptable for younger
children in the past. The disadvantages of this formalist
approach are evident to Further Education (FE) and Higher
Education (HE) lecturers involved in interviewing art foun-
dation or arts degree candidates at the end of the mainstream
school cycle. Many 18-year-olds spend their first year of
higher education in a process of unlearning, reacquainting
themselves with experimentation and playfulness, and reed-
ucating themselves to take responsibility for their own, non-
objective led learning.
Research Questions and Aims
The main research question posed by the Write Here project
was as follows:
Research Question 1: How can visual art and multi-
modal learning increase motivation, and attainment in
literacy?
The project engaged in the essential task of facilitating all
children in their literacy development, regardless of back-
ground, life experience, mother tongue, or "ability." The main
aims were incremental and interconnected: (a) to inspire and
motivate children's writing through experiential engagement
with visual art, (b) to develop techniques designed to improve
attainment in writing generally, and (b) to find ways to engage
more young people with art galleries.
Philosophically and politically, the Write Here project
aimed to challenge the (now prevailing) tendency toward
learning that is objective-led and predicated on knowledge
acquisition, accompanied by an unseemly and aggressive
flight from explorative learning. The project was conceived
partly to address the debate about the value of play and formal
learning, which has become polarized and acrimonious. The
current Coalition government's agenda visibly exerts down-
ward pressure on state schoolteachers who wish to teach liter-
acy (and other subjects) creatively. Children need a variety
of "playful, profound, and unusual" experiences to draw on,
to develop their communication skills (Rumney, 2008).
Connecting with children's personal experiences is not only an
effective way of fostering their engagement with core literacy
skills, but also a meaningful one. But the project sought to
4 SAGE Open
demonstrate that nurturing a creative writing process can sup-
port not only a sense of personal achievement, but measurable
attainment as well. The effects of teaching literacy creatively
have been evidenced recently by data collected by the National
Association of Writers in Education (NAWE) in a study that
demonstrates how the intervention of professional writers into
schools can have a remarkable effect on both achievement and
attainment (see Owen & Munden, 2010). The decision to
involve a professional writer in this project was based on
teachers' beliefs that the act of writing becomes more mean-
ingful when it is shared by a professional reading or creating
their own text. This brought an alternative working knowl-
edge, a fresh perspective to the use of vocabulary, grammar,
and punctuation, and unexpected literary ideas (e.g., using
several genres), which expanded and challenged the received
approaches of the school curriculum. Interestingly, in this
study, the fact that the writer was male had a significant impact
on boys, who traditionally have more negative (sometimes
culturally informed) attitudes to writing.
Method
The Write Here project was a longitudinal examination of
"cycles of shared learning," focused on developing chil-
dren's writing skills and creative thinking. The core project
worked with 900 children from 12 primary and secondary
schools. It extended the previous NAWE research, by plac-
ing a writer into both an art gallery setting, and a lengthy
residency in a lead school. The project's methodology was
predicated on an extended, tripartite relationship between a
writer (Peter Rumney), an art gallery learning officer (Ruth
Lewis-Jones, Djanogly Gallery, Lakeside Arts Centre,
University of Nottingham), and a literacy coordinator (Joy
Buttress, Mellers Primary School, Radford). This triumvirate
of practitioners sharing diverse pedagogies was supported by
Writing East Midlands, by undergraduates and graduates
from both the University of Nottingham and Nottingham
TrentUniversity,andbytheNottinghamCentralImprovement
Partnership. Over a year, 840 pupils, aged 5 to 14 attended
the gallery for a half-day session, developing their writing
skills further after they returned to school. In addition, 60
pupils at Mellers were allocated the role of "experts" for the
project, with their attainment being statistically measured.
All the gallery sessions were modeled, planned, and evalu-
ated in conjunction with staff and pupils at Mellers, and with
the Djanogly gallery team. Preparatory and post-gallery ses-
sions were conducted in Mellers to deepen and extend the
research methodology. The techniques developed there were
applied and refined in microcosm with the other schools in
the four core gallery exhibitions explored in the project.
Baseline assessments, teacher profiling and evaluations,
SATs results, and pupil self-evaluations were used to test the
efficacy of the approach, demonstrating its effects on moti-
vation and a sense of "achievement," and on "attainment" in
writing.
In light of the pedagogical context discussed above, three
assumptions were made about the development of children's
literacy: (a) that they need to play to maximize learning, (b)
that multimodal activities are crucial in engaging imagina-
tions and attention, and (c) that visual art of all kinds offers
an open-ended, empathetic stimulus through which children
use their own life experiences and imaginations to motivate
writing. Philosophically, the methodology was underpinned
by principles of discovery-based learning (Bruner 1967,
1987), mediated by enhanced discovery learning (Marzano,
2011), and facilitated by use of both "soft" and "hard" scaf-
folding to engage different learning styles (Brush & Saye,
2002). Practically, the study drew on and developed whole
school approaches to writing (such as the "Talk for Writing"
and "Big Writing" schemes).
One might argue that persuasive or report writing have an
equivalent (or even more important) role in adult life, requir-
ing a different form of discourse than that of creative writing.
This study, however, is in agreement with Aitken (2013),
who states that by adopting Mantle of the Expert approach,
the students are no longer asked to carry out a piece or writ-
ing "because we are learning about persuasive writing" (p.
46), but instead, they are empowered to be more in charge of
their learning process. It could also be claimed that all the
skills learned through the creative writing, such as narrative
structure and editing techniques, can be applied to formal
writing structures as taught in school. In this article, how-
ever, we intend to avoid any deliberate tendencies to polarize
one approach from another.
Dorothy Heathcote's dramatic enquiry teaching approach
was influential in determining the project methodology, as
were later iterations of her philosophy. This approach known
as Mantle of the Expert encompasses the idea of "learning
growing like a mantle" (Aitken, 2013, p. 35) and, as Ericsson
(2011) argues, is highly applicable within the new field
called arts didactics (an approach explored in the research
project Kunstfagdidaktikk, led by Professor Aslaug Nyrnes,
at Bergen University College in 2004-2008).
There are several good reasons to revisit the work of Heathcote
today. For one thing, it represents an approach to teaching that
strives to empower pupils to reflect critically about issues. It
also stands for a pedagogy that seeks to involve the class
collectively in a process of investigation, and it works from an
art-based philosophy of education that is not informed by a
romantic prioritising of creative expression inherited from the
progressive education movement, or a prioritising of
performance of worship of individual talent that is modelled in
contemporary competitions for young people on television.
(Eriksson, 2011, p. 101)
The Mantle of the Expert methodology is quite flexible and
brings together "the individual and the collective, language
and cognition" (Eriksson, 2011, p. 102); it places the child in
the center of the learning process, responsive to his or her
needs (Heston, 1993). This approach, however, is far from
Rumney et al. 5
child-led. Aitken (2013) argues that although it assumes a
progressive view of learning and positions the child as its
competent co-constructor, it also requires careful teacher
planning and designing activities appropriate to the curricu-
lum level. Children are not just "given expert status in an
empty way, but are encouraged to earn and justify that posi-
tion" (Aitken, 2013, p. 52). One of the teaching modalities
the Mantle of the Expert approach relies on is the concept
based on the study of "a frame" by the sociologist and writer
Erving Goffman (1986). He argued that every individual
uses conceptual frames as a means of organizing his or her
experiences and structuring his or her societal perceptions.
The allocation of the role of an expert to the young learners
(or, in other words, framing them as such) empowers them to
take responsibility for their own learning process and subse-
quently improve their achievements (Kahnemann, 2012).
Case Studies
Having postulated that play and multimodal activities are
important to developing creative writing, the art gallery pro-
vided a unique "domain" for young people's engagement
with both art and literacy. It offered a significantly different
experience from encountering individual artworks (sponsored
by supermarkets) hanging in the school corridor, however
useful and pleasing to the eye such benefactions might be. An
art exhibition, or a collection of museum artifacts, offers audi-
ence choice. Making choices about which works to gravitate
or respond to leads to more active learning. The gallery acts
as a transformative or liminal space in which to encounter art,
a place full of opportunities to construct new knowledge,
question the self, and express this through the written word.
The Write Here team used four Lakeside Arts Centre Gallery
exhibitions (2010-2012) as sites to stimulate children's
engagement with art and literacy.All these exhibitions offered
powerful, motivational stimuli to the making of meaningful
stories (through prose or poetry), and opportunities to explore
writing techniques once the children had been engaged.
This article focuses on two contrasting case studies from
the body of work. In the first, Revolution on Paper (2009-
2011), we discuss how the artwork was used to explore the
writing of prose, with an emphasis on understanding narra-
tive structures. The children engaged with the art through a
process of empathy, which motivated them to understand and
attempt the detailed task of developing narrative causality.
This case study also examines how the work was prepared
for and followed up in the school classroom, and how the
Write Here project was connected to and developed a major
literacy strategy, Pie Corbett's "Talk for Writing" alluded to
earlier. In the second case study, Dust on the Mirror (2010-
2011), we discuss how the gallery offered opportunities to
write poetry. Children responded to the artworks through a
process of reflection and contemplation, which excited their
poetic imaginations and led to writing that was liberated
through experimentation with formal structures.
Revolution on Paper was a British Museum traveling
exhibition of poster and print art (1910-1960), which
explored the politics, iconography, and aesthetics of the mid-
20th century Mexican post-revolutionary period (Ades, &
McCLean 2009). Images of class struggle propaganda, the
experience of urban and rural poverty, the influence of indig-
enous cultures on modern Mexican life, the symbolism Day
of the Dead festivities, and global concerns in the Totalitarian
era jostle with intense portraiture, all encapsulated in Diego
Rivera's iconic portrait of Emiliano Zapata and His Horse
(1932). Through engaging with and responding to this exhi-
bition, 90 children aged 9 to 14 achieved complex and
advanced narrative writing, which reflected their own con-
temporary lives. The process described below embraces the
gallery-based work undertaken by all the participating
school, and the pre-research and follow-up research work
carried out in the lead school.
Pre-work (Mellers, 60 children). The gallery visit was prepared
for by a series of kinesthetic interventions in the participating
school hall. The purpose was twofold: (a) to encourage
engagement with and empathy for characters depicted and
(b) to inculcate and extend the pupils' understanding of nar-
rative structures and archetypes. Physical work included the
embodiment of pictures through tableaux, the description of
an artwork to peers who could not see it, and the develop-
ment of personal narratives from art images, through discus-
sion. A series of warm-up exercises were developed to start
addressing "causality" in narrative, to deal with "and then
syndrome" (Wray & Lewis, 2005), which is one of the big-
gest challenges to young writers. For example, a backward
learning game called "And . . . Why . . . Because" was
devised and introduced. In this, an archetypal story opening
(e.g., "A girl walked into the forest, and . . . .") is offered to
the group by the writer/teacher. Each child has then to
develop the narrative in turn by saying "and" what happened
next. The exercise is then repeated, but the story begins, "A
girl walked into the forest . . .Why? . . . Because . . . " Each
child has now to explain in turn the narrative events in terms
of causality (e.g., "Why did the girl walk into the forest?"
"Because she was running away." "Why was she running
away?" "Because she was scared." "Why was she scared?"
"Because . . . etc."). This process encouraged lateral thinking
through word association activities and was a helpful precur-
sor to interpreting the visual artworks in the gallery.
Gallery work (four schools,90 children). After orientation to the
gallery experience, the children were asked to investigate the
Mexican Revolutionary art with minimal (historical) context
(Figure 1), and the simple question, "What are these Mexi-
can artists trying to say to us about the world?" Children
were free to select the images that most interested, puzzled,
or annoyed them, and discussed the content in small groups
supported by an adult (from the professional and student vol-
unteer team).
6 SAGE Open
Drama was used to interrogate the artwork, and key
images were brought to life through tableaux, which were
responded to and developed by other pupils in the class
(Figure 2). The children identified very strongly with the
images of another era and culture. In enacting and discussing
the revolutionary imagery, they were able to articulate very
clearly their own understanding of class and gender politics,
notions of justice, and family dynamics. One refugee with
little English later wrote,
I thought it was brilliant . . . and when we look at the stories I felt
that I was scared because if I was in that time, I might be dead
because of the war that killed their father . . . their story was
important because it was true . . . because I've seen lots in my
life, because I have lots of things like war and I want to learn
more about them. Was it like my story or not? . . . (Eritrean
refugee aged 10, Mellers)
Although this child's personal experiences may be an
extreme and particular example of empathy with the art-
works, it did demonstrate the general empathetic response of
the children to the exhibition, and their motivation to make
stories from it.
After these initial engagements, the children were intro-
duced to novel ways of identifying narrative structure,
through words, symbols, and kinesthetic structures, such as
story strings. These are simple, long lengths of twine that are
manipulated by the child to create a flexible (and change-
able) narrative "thread" that maps a story on the floor or
large sheet of paper. Post-it notes are then used to assay and
write down possible narrative events and way markers in the
narrative journey, inspired by the child's chosen picture. The
post-it notes are moved around the string at will, providing a
skeleton for more detailed writing of the story later on. The
story can be written from any point in the narrative, but par-
ticipants were challenged to invent their personalized story
backward from the very end (literally writing it upward from
the bottom of the page) to foster causal thinking and to facili-
tate the shifting of writer's block. The "And . . . Why . . .
Because" game was reintroduced to facilitate this process.
After initial reticence, all the gallery visitors embraced this
"backward" writing technique, irrespective of whether they
had encountered it previously in school.
Post-gallery follow-up sessions (Mellers, 60 children). The writer
was asked by the class teacher to write a short five-part story
inspired by one of the Mexican poster images, but adhering
strictly to the format set out by Corbett's "Talk for Writing"
scheme (which had previously been adopted by the school)
Rumney's new archetypal story (Bala and Wareem) drew
consciously on the life experiences of the children as per-
ceived from their fictional writing in the early gallery inter-
actions. The new story was then used in the "Talk for Writing"
model. It was mapped out visually, then acted out and told
through a version of coded sign language. Once the story and
its structure had been learned and embodied physically in
this way by the children, they developed it into their own
narratives through independent writing. Elements of the
original story were substituted with their own ideas, thus
innovating and personalizing the story into new and distinc-
tive narratives.
This use of the "Talk for Writing" process with an art-
inspired story was successful, but it raised the question of
whether more detailed writing could be achieved by extend-
ing this scheme in new ways. To investigate this, a set of
exercises was devised using playing cards and the simple
well-known game of "Sevens" to develop further the con-
cepts of sequencing and backward thinking. Returning to the
story strings and causal games, the pupils continued writing
their own narratives, but backward, constantly expanding
and developing detail through the post-it note mapping struc-
ture. The stories were then rewritten from the beginning.
This also introduced practically the idea of editing in story
writing. At the same time, the children were asked to con-
sider and subsume familiar strategies from their classroom
teaching into the new story (e.g., focusing on particular parts

of speech or grammatical tropes). In addition, in Mellers,
visual artist Huw Feather worked alongside the writer to cre-
ate group drawings of the new stories, using TV camera tech-
niques ("close-ups," "mid-shots," and "long-shots") to
"focus" on different aspects of the narrative structure and
character development through storyboarding, helping to
refine the writing further. Finally, the children used the same
storyboarding techniques to evaluate the whole Write Here
project, discussing it as if it were a narrative of the kind that
had been inculcated during the writing process. They criti-
cally assessed the work in detail, considering the advantages
and disadvantages to their own learning of all the writing
techniques described above, scoring the stages accordingly.
In addition to this raw material, the teaching staff contextual-
ized the children's evaluations according to their own assess-
ments of the pupils in terms of ability, attainment, and
learning needs. This process was subsequently used by the
team to evaluate the whole Write Here process.
Dust on the Mirror (eight schools, 290 children) was an
exhibition of multimedia art (drawing, painting, and video
installation) by Siân Bowen, Christopher Cook, Susan Derges,
Donna Ong, and Charwei Tsai (Godfrey, 2010). The artists
used materials such as graphite, light particles, and film to cre-
ate contemplative, abstract artworks (Figure 3). Central to the
exhibition (and therefore germane to the Write Here research)
were the notions of interconnectedness, deep thinking, and
sensual imagining, which were used to explore a range of writ-
ing issues: reflection and the finding of characters and genera-
tion of stories, freeing up the writing process, generating
language and poetic ideas, manipulating expressive language
and finding structure for poetic ideas, and editing.
Whereas the gritty realism and macabre fantasy of the
Mexican revolutionary exhibition enabled young people to
write stories derived from relatively direct connections they
made with their own lives, engagement with the meditative
and reflective works in Dust on the Mirror engendered calm
abstraction and engagement with mythic themes.
The artwork encouraged philosophical reflection and
stimulated higher order thinking, as well as developing
aspects of emotional intelligence. Children aged 5 years
upward explored the poetry of the image, be it still or mov-
ing. The writing (and speaking) work, therefore, addressed
primarily the generation and structuring of poetic ideas.
There were no previsit sessions for this case study. The
work began with the pupils reclining on duvets in a side gal-
lery to view two simultaneously projected Charwei Tsai
films. In these, the artist wrote/painted mantras on large mir-
rors reflecting the sky and the ocean. Each pupil was then
given a personal mirror to look at, to explore the notion of
"reflection" in both its physical and metaphorical senses. By
"reflecting" upon both the "inner" and "outer" world, the
children could then invest their own experiences in making
statements, assumptions, and suppositions about the charac-
ter of the artist. This raised a series of questions designed to
channel the pupils'imaginations into story and myth making:
"What do we know?" (differentiated for younger children as
"What can we see?"),"What do we think we know?" (differ-
entiated as "What can we guess?"), and "What would we like
to ask the artist/girl/woman in the film?" The potential sto-
ries or histories of the artist were then debated in small
groups, supported by an adult, and shared among the whole
class.
The session then moved physically from the "reflection"
space into the wider gallery, surrounded by the other artists'
abstract works. On the floor, rolls of Mylar (thick mirrored
paper) were unscrolled. These replicated the sea and sky of
Tsai's videos, and the children were invited to draw or write
stories on the reflective surface, effectively adopting the
mantle of the artist seen in the videos. This mark making
exercise was intended to free up the "writer," unfettered by
formal language, using the children's propensity to write and
draw simultaneously. The unpressurized work was particu-
larly important for unskilled writers or those with no discern-
ible writing skills at all (due to age, disability, or lack of
English). The mirrored writing surfaces, placed with sensi-
tivity to the exhibition works, became de facto new, collab-
orative artworks on the gallery floor, increasing the pupil's

sense of involvement in, and ownership of, a cultural space
they would not normally access.
At this point, as part of interventions discussing the prob-
lems of being a professional writer, participants discussed
"blank page" syndrome. This demonstrated to the children
that the issues they faced as writers were shared by adults as
well, with the intention of raising self-esteem and confidence
to tackle their writing tasks. Once again, speaking and listen-
ing to the stories and images that the pupils had committed to
the "blank" mirror paper was an important developmental
phase in the gallery session. The second "writer's issue"
addressed was the challenge of accessing and developing
interesting ideas. Responding to the array of images sur-
rounding them on the gallery walls, the pupils were invited to
extrapolate potential stories that they could see in the images
(irrespective of the artists' original intentions). This was
achieved though modeling the "what is possible" questions.
The openness to interpretation of the abstract works, and
lack of judgment in adult's responses to the children's ideas,
were key in realizing their potential as story makers.
To collate and embed these responses to the imagery, the
pupils were given A4 scaffolding grids on which they wrote
down all the characters/emotions/sounds/senses/thoughts/
conflicts that they felt were expressed in the artworks. The
words or phrases they wrote were unencumbered by expecta-
tions of grammatical or spelling accuracy (which was explic-
itly put aside). Once these grids or word banks were filled
out, Rumney modeled the writing of "Mykus" (a new haiku
form in which the Japanese 5/7/5 syllable line structure is
replaced by a more accessible 5/7/5 word structure), using
the grids as source material. The children's writing had there-
fore been scaffolded very carefully, but the writing was fresh,
experimental, and improvisatory. The final Myku writing
exercise took place in the last 10 min of the 120-min session.
This was achievable because of the depth of imaginative
work, and the scaffolding, that led up to it.
They gained a new way of thinking about art and writing through
the writing strategies in the workshop . . . I found it particularly
interesting their response to the installation. Having the space to
reflect over that expanse of time is something largely missed
from their ordinary, fast-paced timetable, and the pupils got a lot
out of the experience. (Key Stage 3 teacher, SamworthAcademy,
Nottingham, age group 12-13)
Below is the example of Mykus written by children
aged 7 to 11:
A cold misty night where
stray dogs and spirits roam all around
and the only sound is water
I was fighting in the
war with my best friends, but on
the radio he died silently
I held the cross tightly.
"Lord save us." And then I ran.
Ran to save my country
Ashes floating down from war,
the salty tears of devastated children crying.
Fiery bombs, upset children thinking all is lost.
Findings
Attainment
The findings of the Write Here project are presented here in
the context of previous data on pupils' attainment in writing,
and based on a new dataset created as part of this research
(see below). All 30 children from Year 6 (Mellers, 2011
cohort) were part of the project evaluation (Table 1). This
core group of young learners evaluated the project through
creative recall exercises, and drew up with the writer a list of
the activities they had undertaken throughout the project.
These activities were then grouped into a simple list form
with options to indicate (from 1 to 10) how effective the chil-
dren had found them.
The medium term benefits of the study are attested by the
effect on SATs levels after a year. It is impossible, however,
to determine the longer term benefits (i.e., beyond 2 years)
due to the participating cohort being lost to a diverse second-
ary system once they leave primary school. Although no
claim for this improvement in terms of attainment can be
made for the project in isolation from other strategies used in
the school, staff across the school indicated that the Write
Here project was hugely influential on attainment (particu-
larly by those struggling with writing), because of its impact
on pupil motivation and engagement.

The Write Here project and strategies . . . have had a huge impact
on the writing attainment of children over the last two years
[with]a dramatic increase in the number of children achieving
Level 4 or above. (Primary Literacy Coordinator)
In addition to above, a target group of six pupils was iden-
tified, to analyze the more subtle sublevels attained by the
children. Three out of six pupils demonstrated accelerated
progress, exceeding teacher expectations. These three reflect
a wide range of abilities and confidence as writers.
I feel really confident at writing stories than I did before . . . I can
place a lot of punctuation with writing before and I'm not really
good at SATs but getting higher at the level. It makes me feel
good about myself. (Pupil, Mellers)
Three other pupils also met expectations; one was high
ability technically, but poor in terms of actual content, which
nevertheless improved; the other had both Special Needs
and English as a second language, therefore their "average"
progress was regarded as "very good" for a child with this
particular learning needs. The third pupil, a refugee with no
English on arrival, made a five sublevels increase in a year.
The teacher assessments for the children's work indicate
that all these six pupils made "very good progress" in writ-
ing skills and imaginative content through the project, and
that this is reflected in their attainment. Since the study was
conducted, there has been a change in the way "progress" is
measured in primary schools. The idea of "levels and sub-
levels" attained across a child's lifetime in primary school
has been abandoned and replaced with a more "age appro-
priate" approach. When the project data were collected,
however, the old "levels" system of progress measurement
indicated that greater than expected progress had been made,
as indicated in the specific examples cited.
Engagement With the Art Gallery
During the project, teacher evaluations attested to the effec-
tiveness of the gallery-based work in motivating children to
speak and write, irrespective of their age:
Pupils began to develop their own narratives for the paintings
through discussion . . . their individual work enabled them to
focus on their language choices. (Year 8 Teacher)
At the heart of the pedagogy was play, stillness, reflection,
and nonobjective led learning.
[This was] a new way of thinking about art and writing, [giving]
a sense of ownership of their work, [and offering] the use of
reflection (both kinds!) to build thinking skills and the space to
create. (Year 8 Teacher)
Of the 28 lead teachers who attended, two found the approach
challenging because they had expectations that children
would be "doing more writing" to develop their literacy. The
children's imaginative, passionate, and unusual follow-up
writing subsequently submitted to the gallery by these teach-
ers attested to the powerful motivation and inspiration
achieved by the Write Here methodology.
Motivation
Thirty children from Year 5 (Mellers, 2011 cohort) scored
each activity in the Write Here project out of 10 (Figure 4).
The average scores for most activities are high, demonstrat-
ing that the work motivated the children and offered a range
of activities that appealed to all abilities. The lowest average
scores are given to some of the more technical aspects of the
work, such as writing backward. However, teacher observa-
tions indicate that some of the children were marking these
aspects down because they were difficult, rather than because
they were unhelpful, and that these strategies were useful to
the whole group, however unusual and challenging.
Gallery Work: Legacy Project
After the main Write Here project ended, 700 Key Stage 2
pupils from inner city Nottingham schools have visited the
gallery (between January 2012 and April 2014), to take part
in the legacy program of literacy workshops. These work-
shops have been delivered in the gallery by 28 graduate and
undergraduate volunteers, who have been mentored and
trained in cascade fashion by the original research team.
Faced with competition for scarce time and resources in
schools, the literacy work has proved to be an effective mag-
net to bring pupils into the gallery. Teachers have been able
to make a pragmatic choice to engage with both the "nuts and
bolts" of writing and with a cultural site in one visit.
It was a great introduction to how interesting a gallery can be
and how art can be used to develop literacy skills. . . . A great
opportunity for a real writing experience to further develop the
literacy experience. . . . [It] Enthused students, many of whom
returned with family and friends in order to share their
experiences, and [it was] a great opportunity to see important
works of art that I believe they will appreciate even more as they
grow up. (Primary Arts Coordinator/Year 6 Teacher)
Conclusion
From September 2014, children as young as 4 years old will
be expected to be able to write a sentence by the time they
finish their foundation stage year. Some children are able to
do this, but many still need time to play first. The New
National Curriculum states that all children will achieve
expected levels, regardless of special educational needs. This
will seriously affect many vulnerable children, and it is not
clear how this will raise standards throughout the education
system. The Write Here project demonstrated that the teach-
ing of writing skills should not be undertaken simply for
their own sake, or solely for utilitarian purposes. Participating
pupils regarded "pointless" writing as demotivating, and this
10 SAGE Open
attitude affects their attainment. The project demonstrated
how effectively an art gallery could be used to enable chil-
dren, of all ages, to make a personal connection to art, talk
about it, be motivated to write about it, and support that writ-
ing with specific skills acquisition. The project scaffolded a
process of ownership for the children, demystifying the writ-
ing process, and demonstrating to pupils that they are not
alone in struggling to express themselves.
This work, in both the art gallery and the classroom, led to
a series of impacts. First, children developed (a) a significant
improvement in literacy attainment, especially in sublevels,
and (b) increasing confidence to express themselves in writ-
ing, irrespective of their "ability." The children no longer
saw "writing" as "work." Second, professional writers were
enabled to achieve a greater understanding of their potential
to influence young writers, whereas student writers acquired
important workplace skills and knowledge (public speaking,
presentation, teamwork), which affected their abilities to fos-
ter writing and others in the future. In the longer term, the
study demonstrated impact in embedding experiential learn-
ing strategies developed by the research team, and subse-
quently implemented by teachers into the school curriculum.
The study evidenced the importance of creative, playful,
multimodal activities in fostering both motivation and
achievement in children's writing. It also indicated what a
powerful site for learning an art gallery can be, due to the
possibilities for individual interpretation and empathy that
visual art can offer the young writer. At the same time, the
study also acknowledges that formal structures can be used
intelligently and creatively to liberate pupils' imaginations,
and consequently enable them to express themselves coher-
ently. Paradoxically, to achieve what many might consider to
be a "prosaic" goal--the raising of attainment--this work
drew on the most "poetic" of ideas--the practice of playing
with form to discover meaning. This process enabled a fun-
damental principle underpinning the work, namely, that
young people have something important to communicate
about their experience of the world, and that "seeing" things
and "doing" things have a vital role in enabling them to give
witness to their lives through the written and spoken word.
