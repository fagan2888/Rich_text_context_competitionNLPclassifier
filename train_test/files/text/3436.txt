Background
Long-term survivorship is the new mantra for cancer manage-
ment. Many studies have assessed strategies that may enhance
physiological outcomes and palliate the varying range of
debilitating symptoms associated with cancer and its treat-
ments (Calfas et al., 1996; Davies, Batehup, & Thomas, 2011;
Gray et al., 2013; Jones, Courneya, Fairey, & Mackey, 2005).
Particular attention has been given to basic lifestyle factors
including weight, physical activity, and diet. These lifestyle
factors among others have been held culpable for cancer pro-
gression, recurrence, and development of new events/dis-
eases (Davies et al., 2011; Rock et al., 2012). Though the
relationship between these lifestyle factors and cancer out-
comes are still unclear, it has been estimated that 27% to 39%
of cancers can be prevented by improving diet, physical activ-
ity, and body composition (World Cancer Research Fund,
2009). Many advanced countries are incorporating self-man-
agement support centered on these lifestyle factors into their
cancer care system as an adjunct therapy to surgery, chemo-
therapy, and other treatment options (Jones et al., 2005; Loh,
Yip, Packer, & Quek, 2010). This support involves counsel-
ing survivors on lifestyle behavior changes and providing
them with necessary resources to promote adherence.
Counseling support is recommended as best upon diagnosis,
when the diagnosed are vulnerable and willing to learn and
play a more active role in their health care (Davies et al.,
2011; Demark-Wahnefried, Aziz, Rowland, & Pinto, 2005;
Jones, Courneya, Fairey, & Mackey, 2004). Policies and
guidelines on nutrition, physical activity, and weight manage-
ment which provide a global perspective on self-management
strategies to improve cancer outcomes and quality of life have
been developed (American Cancer Society, 2012; World
Cancer Research Fund, 2009).
Nigeria, the highest populated country in Africa (Central
Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2015), is only at the infancy
stage of cancer management. Its field of oncology is rife with
problems ranging from no national cancer policy to lack of
oncology specialists, finances, and resources, to mention a
few (Oluka, Shi, Nie, & Sun, 2014). Besides the control of
reproductive cancers which is included in the National pol-
icy on reproductive health and strategic framework as well as
in the policies on food, nutrition, and health promotion, the
government has yet to approve any cancer policy (Federal

Abstract
This study sought to identify factors associated with doctors' intention to provide lifestyle counseling to cancer survivors
and provide an evidence base for developing an intervention to maximize counseling behavior in cancer management
programs. A cross-sectional survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was conducted. Participants were 210
medical doctors recruited from two hospitals in Nigeria. Participants completed questionnaires containing all the theoretical
constructs of TPB. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated adequate fit for
the final structural models. Attitude and subjective norm, but not perceived behavioral control, were identified as significant
predictors of intention to provide lifestyle counseling. Intention also significantly predicted counseling behavior. This evidence
informs the design of a behavioral intervention to improve lifestyle counseling behavior in cancer management programs.

Ministry of Health, 2004; Kolawole, 2011). Also, in a coun-
try of more than 170 million people with cancer incidence of
about 74,000 for both males and females in 2014, there are
approximately nine radiation centers, 30 radiation oncolo-
gists, 100 pathologists, and less than 100 oncologists (CIA,
2015; Kolawole, 2011; World Health Organization, 2014).
Treatment of cancer, where available, is expensive and in a
country, known to be "rich with poor people," most of those
diagnosed are poor and cannot afford treatment (Health
Reform Foundation of Nigeria, 2006). This is compounded
by the lack of a system of health care financing and shared
risks, which has led to families bearing cancer care costs
through spending savings and investments, borrowing at
high economic and social costs, and sale of resources like
homes and investments, thereby making cancer an important
risk factor in poverty and loss of social status among the
middle class (Adebamowo, 2013). Ultimately, rather than
pay for recommended treatment methods, survivors fall prey
to a host of unreliable and harmful herbal remedies as well as
other unorthodox treatment options (Oluka, Shi, et al., 2014).
In the face of these issues, cancer mortality rate is over the
top and strategies for long-term survival are nonexistent
(Ferlay et al., 2010). While policies are still being tendered to
the government for approval and financing, self-manage-
ment strategies have been proposed to enable cancer patients
cope effectively and reduce the long-term impact of cancer
(Oluka, Shi, et al., 2014). These strategies, though not a
replacement for treatment, costs little or nothing and will
serve as an immediate response to disease management, and
improve long-term survival and quality of life. The concerted
effort of a team of multidisciplinary health care providers
was recommended to ensure implementation of these strate-
gies (Oluka, Shi, et al., 2014).
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been
employed in many cancer management­related studies
(Courneya et al., 2004; Di Sarra et al., 2015; Jones et al.,
2005; Wade, Smith, Hankins, & Llewellyn, 2010). It is a
social-cognitive model which postulates that performance of
a particular behavior is determined by intention which is in
turn, influenced by three constructs: attitude, subjective
norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC; Ajzen, 1991,
2012). Intentions are subjective judgments about how indi-
viduals will behave in future and has been used as a surrogate
measure of future behavior in many studies (Giles et al.,
2007; Tan, 2013; Wade et al., 2010). Attitude refers to an
individual's positive or negative evaluation of performing a
behavior. Subjective norm is the individual's perception of
social pressure to/not to perform a behavior. PBC reflects an
individual's perceived ease or difficulty to perform a behav-
ior and is assumed to have both indirect (through association
with intention) and direct influence on behavior. The theory
further postulates that these three determinants of intention
may be measured directly (based on individual overall
beliefs) or indirectly (based on individual specific salient
beliefs; Ajzen, 1991; Francis et al., 2004).
Oncology specialists are in a key position to provide life-
style change support to cancer patients. Oncologists espe-
cially, have intimate knowledge of the patients'health status,
and are better placed to help them choose behavior changes
that are appropriate, safe, and feasible (Oluka, Shi, et al.,
2014; Sabiston, Vallance, & Brunet, 2010). This personal
touch may not only encourage lifestyle behavior change but
may also ensure adherence. In fact, many studies have pro-
vided preliminary evidence consistently demonstrating
oncologist approval as a powerful tool in predicting inten-
tion and facilitating health behavior change among cancer
survivors (Blanchard et al., 2003; Courneya & Friedenreich,
1997; Jones et al., 2004; Rock et al., 2012). Based on the
TPB, the oncologist's approval is termed a normative belief
and has been reported to translate into feelings of approval
and support (favorable subjective norm), belief that the
behavior may be useful (positive attitude), and greater moti-
vation/intention to perform the behavior (Jones et al., 2005).
However, as Nigeria has a limited number of oncology spe-
cialists as is common with many low- and middle-income
countries, it was recommended that rather than wait for
more specialists to be trained, a cost-effective strategy
would be to recruit physicians, regardless of their specialty,
to provide lifestyle counseling to cancer patients (Oluka,
Shi, et al., 2014).
In this study, the TPB is used to identify the predictors of
a physician's intention to provide lifestyle counseling to can-
cer survivors during treatment consultation, with the objec-
tive of providing an evidence base for developing an
intervention to maximize lifestyle counseling behavior in
cancer management programs.
In this article, the terms cancer patient or survivor, and
doctor or physician are used interchangeably.
Method
In this study, we hypothesized that a physician's attitude,
subjective norm, and perceived behavior control would pre-
dict intention to counsel cancer patients. Furthermore, inten-
tion and PBC would predict actual lifestyle counseling
behavior.
Participants and Design
We employed a cross-sectional survey design. Participants
were medical doctors working at two major federal and state
government-owned hospitals (University of NigeriaTeaching
Hospital [UNTH] and Enugu State University of Science and
Technology Teaching Hospital [ESUTH]) in Enugu, Nigeria.
Ethical approval and permissions were obtained from the
Ethics Review Boards of Tongji Medical College, Wuhan,
China; UNTH; and ESUTH. Convenience sampling method
was employed in the selection of study participants; how-
ever, only certified doctors with at least 1 year of experience
were eligible to participate. Self-administered questionnaires
Oluka et al. 3
and informed consent forms were given to willing partici-
pants. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed and 210
medical doctors recruited.
Measures
A lifestyle counseling questionnaire, modeled based on the
TPB, was employed in this study. The questionnaire, con-
taining questions on all the TPB constructs and demographic
characteristics had been previously validated in a pilot study
on participants from the same population as this study
(Oluka, Apio, Phiri, Nie, & Sun, 2014). Both direct and indi-
rect measures of TPB were employed.
The direct measures included two attitude items (ATT),
two items on subjective norm (SN), three PBC, and three
intention (INT) items. Responses were scored on a 7-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree). Individual item scores were averaged to
produce a composite score for each construct.
Indirect measures included five behavioral beliefs for
attitude (ATB) and their corresponding outcome evalua-
tions (10 items in total), five normative beliefs (NB) and
their corresponding motivation to comply (10 items total),
and two control beliefs (CB) and their corresponding
strength of belief (four items total). Responses were either
unipolar, 1 (extremely unlikely) to 7 (extremely likely), or
bipolar, -3 (extremely undesirable) to +3 (extremely
desirable). Each belief was multiplied with its corre-
sponding outcome to obtain weighed scores which were
summed to create composite scores for each construct so
that possible ranges of total scores were -105 to +105 for
ATB and NB and -42 to +42 for CB. For both direct and
indirect measures, high summary scores consistently
reflect stronger or more positive beliefs toward the target
behavior.
Actual lifestyle counseling behavior was assessed based on
a single question with a "yes/no" response format employed.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the charac-
teristics of the study population. Internal consistency for the
reliability of each item relating to the direct TPB measures
was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Content validity of
indirect measures was confirmed using simple bivariate cor-
relations between direct and indirect measures of the same
construct.
Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to
determine the association between TPB variables and life-
style counseling. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
first conducted to determine whether there is empirical sup-
port for the hypothesized theoretical factor structure. Based
on the confirmed factor structure, SEM was then carried
out to identify the potential relationships among all TPB
variables.
Maximum likelihood method was used to estimate param-
eters in the SEM analysis and model fit assessment was
based on absolute model fit indices using chi-square (2),
2/df ratio (<2.25), p value (>.05), and relative fit indices
using goodness-of-fit index (GFI > 0.95), Tucker­Lewis
index (TLI > 0.95), comparative fit index (CFI > 0.95), and
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08).
All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical
package 20.0 and Amos version 20.
Results
Of the 350 questionnaires distributed, 210 were returned
fully completed (60% response rate). Thirty-five additional
questionnaires were incomplete. Of the 210 participants, 136
were male (64.8%) and 74 (35.2%) female. Most work at
UNTH (n = 118, 56.2%) and average number of years quali-
fied is 7.6 years (SD = 4.78; range = 1-34 years). Oncologists
represented only 7.1% of the population, general practitio-
ners (GPs) 16.2%, and other specialties 76.7%.
The research framework of this study consists of three
directly measured (ATT, SN, and PBC) and three indirectly
measured (ATB, NB, and CB) exogenous variables. It also
consists of two endogenous variables (intention and behav-
ior). The mean values of the directly measured exogenous
variables, including intention, ranged from 5.39 to 6.54 with
standard deviations ranging from 0.84 to 1.28. The indirectly
measured variables had means ranging from 13.09 to 49.07
(SD = 11.2-30.09) due to the multiplicative approach used to
calculate the measurement scale (Francis et al., 2004). Mean
scores were highest for both directly and indirectly measured
attitude indicating that Nigerian doctors consider lifestyle
counseling for cancer patients to be a worthwhile behavior.
Test for normality using the Shapiro­Wilk test indicates nor-
mal distribution of data (p values > .05) for the indirect TPB
measures but not the direct measures.
As recommended by Francis et al. (2004), bivariate cor-
relations between the direct and indirect measures of TPB
were carried out to determine the content validity of the indi-
rect measures. Due to the violations of the assumptions of
normality and linearity by the direct measures of TPB,
Spearman Rank correlation method was employed with sig-
nificant correlations observed between directly measured
attitude and indirectly measured attitudinal belief (r = .468, p
< .01). Direct (SN) and indirect (NB) measures of social
norms were also significantly correlated (r = .136, p < .05);
however, no significant correlation was observed for both the
direct (PBC) and indirect (CB) control measures.
Convergent Validity
Upon conducting CFA, convergent reliability of the mea-
surement items were assessed. Convergent validity estab-
lishes that measures that should be related are in reality,
related. According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), this can be
4 SAGE Open
assessed based on item reliability of each measure, reliability
of each construct, and the average variance extracted (AVE).
Item reliability was assessed based on the factor loading of
each item on its underlying construct. In this study, the "cut-
off" point chosen for significant factor loading is 0.30 based
on our sample size of 210, a recommended minimum by
Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2006). Construct
reliability was measured using composite reliability (CR),
AVE, and Cronbach's alpha with values of .6, .5, and .6 or
higher, respectively, deemed significant (Fornell & Larcker,
1981; Nunnally, 1970).
As shown in Table 1, the remaining number of items for
each construct is as follows: Attitude (two items), SN (two
items), PBC (two items), Intention (three items), ATB (three
items), NB (four items), and CB (zero items). Control belief
(CB) was excluded entirely from further analysis of the indi-
rect TPB model as the factor loadings of its observed vari-
ables were too low and it had no statistically significant
correlation with other latent variables in the model.
The AVE for PBC and NB were slightly below 0.5, sug-
gesting that the latent factors may not be well explained by
their observed variables. Otherwise, all requirements for
convergent validity of the proposed constructs are adequate.
Cronbach's alpha for the indirect measures were not calcu-
lated as people can logically hold both positive and negative
beliefs about the same behavior, thereby making it inappro-
priate to assess their reliability with an internal consistency
criterion (Ajzen, 2006; Francis et al., 2004).
Discriminant Validity
This establishes that measures which are not supposed to be
related are in reality, not related. In particular, the variance
shared between a construct and any other construct in the
model, should be less than the variance that construct shares
with its indicators (Fornell, Tellis, & Zinkhan, 1982). In
this study, discriminant validity was assessed by comparing
the square root of the AVE for a given construct, with the
correlation between that construct and other constructs
(Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). A significant
result, suggesting that a construct is more strongly corre-
lated with its indicators than with other constructs in the
model, is obtained when the square roots of the AVEs are
greater than the interconstruct correlations. As shown in
Table 2, all proposed constructs had satisfactory discrimi-
nant validity.
Goodness-of-Fit Indices
Goodness-of-fit indices for the CFA of the direct TPB mea-
sures were 2/df = 30.12/22 = 1.37; p value = .12; GFI = 0.97;
TLI = 0.98; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.04. Indices for the CFA
of indirect measures were 2/df = 56.46/32 = 1.76; p value =
.005; GFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.96; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.06.
The CFA results are satisfactory and suggest that the linear
structural model is appropriate for our data (Hair et al., 2006;
Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Structural Model
Power analysis for the SEM(s) was calculated based on the
number of latent and observed variables in each model, the
anticipated effect size, desired probability, and statistical
power levels (Cohen, 1988; Soper, 2014). The recommended
minimum sample size to achieve a power of 0.80 for the indi-
rect TPB model structure was 116 participants which is well
below our study sample size of 210. However, the direct TPB
model would have required 288 participants.
The SEM results and explanations are based on the final
or generating structural models after the CFA. However, the
hypothesized models for both the direct and indirect models
are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, to provide a
clearer picture of the modeling process. Measured variables
with low factor loadings in the hypothesized models were
excluded, and the multivariate Lagrange Multiplier (LM)
test--a modification index indicating possibilities for
improving model fit--was also employed to decide which
variables significantly improve model fit.
The final direct model (Figure 3) had a reasonably good
fit with the absolute fit (2), p value > .05. Only attitude had
a significant direct effect on intention (standardized estimate
[SE] = .44, p < .001) to provide lifestyle counseling. SN and
PBC were not significantly related to intention. This contra-
dicts previous findings which identified both social referents
influence and control factors as key predictors of behavioral
intention (Ajzen, 2002). Approximately 24% of variance
(R2) of intention was explained by the three latent variables.
The final indirect model included only attitudinal belief
and normative beliefs. Though the p value for the 2 of the
model was <.05, the model was not rejected as absolute fit p
value is always likely to be small for large enough samples
(Collins & Carey, 2007). Other relative goodness-of-fit indi-
ces were adequate (Figure 4). As observed in the direct TPB
model, ATB (SE = .40, p < .001) was the best significant
predictor of intention to provide lifestyle counseling. NB
also significantly predicted intention (SE = .27, p = .004)
unlike SN in the final direct model. The proportion of vari-
ance (R2) in intention explainable byATB and NB is approxi-
mately 33%.
Predicting Behavior
According to the TPB, behavior is expected to be predicted
by intention and PBC (Wade et al., 2010). However, behav-
ior was excluded from the SEM analysis as it was assessed
using only one question with a yes/no response and so cannot
be accurately estimated usingAmos (Albright & Park, 2009).
Logistic regression of behavior on intention, PBC, and con-
trol beliefs was conducted and indicated intention as the only
statistically significant predictor of behavior with odds ratio
Oluka et al. 5
(OR) of 2.231 and 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.058,
4.706] (p < .05). This suggests that the odds of providing
lifestyle counseling among respondents with high intention
are 2.1 times greater than the odds for those with low inten-
tion. PBC and CB were not significantly associated with
behavior.
Discussion
In this study, we assessed the ability of the TPB to predict
intention and lifestyle counseling behavior among doctors.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess lifestyle
counseling behavior for cancer survivors among physicians.
Previous studies have examined other health behaviors in
relation to cancer survivors but not physicians (Graves,
2003; Jones et al., 2005). Overall, our results showed that
TPB constructs integrated into the structural models accom-
plished model fit and showed significant direct effects on
intention.
This study included both direct and indirect measures of
TPB, a controversial issue in the operationalization of the
theory. Direct measures of TPB have been proven effective

in predicting intention in many studies (AL Ziadat, 2014;
Wade et al., 2010). Indirect measures have also been evi-
denced as providing insight into the underlying cognitive
foundation of each TPB construct (Giles et al., 2007; Valois,
Desharnais, Godin, Perron, & Lecompte, 1993). However,
Francis et al. (2004) recommends that both measures be
included in TPB studies as they are expected to be positively
correlated when measuring the same construct.
In both the final direct and indirect TPB models, results
indicated that attitude best predicted intention. This result is
similar to those of past studies (AL Ziadat, 2014; Collins &
Carey, 2007; Tan, 2013). This indicates that those with posi-
tive attitude are likely to engage in lifestyle counseling for
cancer patients.
Interestingly, subjective norm predicted intention in only
the indirect TPB model but not in the direct model. This
attests to the recommendation that both measures be used as
neither approach is perfect (Francis et al., 2004). The result
implies that while doctors may believe counseling cancer
patients to be a worthwhile behavior, social referents includ-
ing colleagues and patients among others may have an influ-
ence on their intention to do so.
Perceived control had no significant effect on intention in
either structural model, making it the only aspect of TPB that
was not confirmed in this study. PBC was, however, found to
have moderate significant correlations with SN in the final
direct model. This provides empirical evidence that it is an
important extension of TPB. Also, this correlation may have
suppressed the effect of PBC on intention and so should not
be ignored (Collins & Carey, 2007; Wade et al., 2010).
Both direct and indirect measures of PBC also had no sig-
nificant association with actual counseling behavior. This
result is somewhat surprising in light of previous research
that found PBC to be a significant predictor of intention and
behavior (AL Ziadat, 2014; Jones et al., 2005).
Intention was a significant predictor of behavior, replicating
results in previous studies (Ajzen, 2002; Collins & Carey, 2007;
Downs & Hausenblas, 2003; Tan, 2013). Specifically in this
study, stronger intentions to provide counseling were predicted
by more positive attitudes and possibly the positive influence of
social referents regarding lifestyle counseling. Thus, doctors
acknowledged feeling relatively positive about providing life-
style counseling but also indicated that the opinion of social ref-
erents may influence their behavior. It is worthy of note that
72.9% of participants reported providing lifestyle counseling to
those diagnosed with cancer in the past. This finding corre-
sponds with that of the pilot study and raises the possibility that
past behavior may influence future behavior (Collins & Carey,
2007; Oluka, Apio, et al., 2014; Ouellette & Wood, 1998).
Comparing the R2 results of the final TPB models, the
indirect model explained 9% more variance in intention than

did the direct model. Based on this finding and the fact that
only the indirect model was able to show significant direct
effect of SN on intention, it may be surmised that the indirect
model in this study may be statistically superior to the direct
model in predicting lifestyle counseling behavior.
Ultimately, the application of TPB to understand counsel-
ing behavior showed that intention was mediated by attitude
and subjective norm; and actual counseling behavior medi-
ated by intention. As such, attitude and subjective norm are
appropriate modifiable targets to increase lifestyle counsel-
ing intention and behavior among doctors. The results also
suggest that Nigerian doctors of various specialties are will-
ing to contribute to cancer care in the face of limited oncol-
ogy specialists. The challenge is to develop and implement
strategies to help doctors maintain this positive intention and
actually translate it into practice during treatment consulta-
tions. As lifestyle counseling is probably the easiest and least
expensive aspect of cancer management, development of
strategies to maximize the behavior should be prioritized.
For example, attitude and SN can be improved by training or
providing doctors with resources that would improve their
knowledge and awareness on the benefits of healthy lifestyle
changes. In addition, the national medical council (or/and
other influential bodies) endorsement could make provision
of lifestyle counseling more likely. Development of a life-
style counseling intervention may provide the much-needed
improvement in cancer outcomes for patients in Nigeria and
other low/middle-income countries.
Some limitations of this study deserve mention. Actual
counseling behavior was assessed with only a single ques-
tion on past provision of lifestyle counseling which may
have been insufficient to fully assess the construct. Next, our
study sample size of 210 did not ensure adequate power to
optimally test the direct TPB model; thus, future studies

using SEM to replicate this study should aim for a larger
sample size. Furthermore, the current study population con-
sisted of doctors in one city in Nigeria and may require rep-
lication in several other cities to enhance generalizability of
the results. Finally, we used a cross-sectional study design
and therefore cannot infer causation.
Conclusion
Despite the limitations in this study, the TPB model proved
effective in predicting intention and lifestyle counseling
behavior for cancer patients among medical doctors. The
findings suggest that theory-based interventions focused on
enhancing attitude, subjective norm and intentions may have
positive impacts on lifestyle counseling among doctors.
Future research may assess strategies to improve doctors'
intentions to provide counseling. Also, a lifestyle counsel-
ing intervention for cancer survivors in general practice is
warranted.
Clinical Implications
This study recommended provision of lifestyle counseling in
routine cancer care as a feasible self-management strategy
which will improve the quality of life and overall survival of
Nigerian cancer patients, while costing little or nothing.
The results provide evidence that Nigerian doctors of various
specialties are willing to contribute to cancer care in the face
of limited oncology specialists. However, strategies to
improve physician's attitude and influence of social referents
on lifestyle counseling behavior may be required.
