Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect and mechanism of action of metformin on proliferation of a
human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (FaDu).
Methods: FaDu cells were treated with metformin (25­125 mmol/l). Cell proliferation was
evaluated via CCK-8 assay. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription­polymerase chain reaction
was used to evaluate microRNA (miR)-21-5p and PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) expression.
PDCD4 protein was quantified by Western blot.
Results: Metformin significantly inhibited FaDu cell proliferation in a dose- (25­100 mmol/l) and
time-dependent manner (12 h­36 h), significantly downregulated miR-21-5p, and upregulated
PDCD4 mRNA and protein expression.
Conclusions: Metformin significantly inhibited FaDu cell proliferation, possibly via down-
regulation of miR-21-5p and upregulation of PDCD4.

Introduction
Hypopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the
most malignant tumours of the upper aero-
digestive tract and is difficult to diagnose
early due to occult lesion location.1 Despite
progress in medical and surgical therapy, the
5-year survival rate of this cancer has not
improved over the past decade.2 Indeed,
hypopharyngeal carcinoma has the worst
prognosis among head and neck cancers.3­5

The insulin sensitizer metformin is the first
line drug for the treatment of type 2 dia-
betes,6 and has been shown to reduce the
incidence of several tumours in diabetic
patients.7­10 Metformin has been shown to
inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer
cells in vitro (including liver, prostate, cer-
vical and ovarian cancers),11­14 but its effect
on hypopharyngeal carcinoma is unclear.
Abnormal expression of the microRNA,
miR-21-5 p, and its downstream target gene,
programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) has been
shown in multiple tumours,15 and miR-21-5p
is significantly upregulated in hypopharyn-
geal carcinoma.16 To date, there is little
information regarding the effects of metfor-
min on the expression of miR-21-5p and
PDCD4 in hypopharyngeal tumour cells. The
aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate
the effects of metformin on cell proliferation
in the human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell
line, FaDu, as well as the expression of miR-
21-5p and PDCD4 in these cells.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell
line (FaDu) was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection
(ATCCÕ, Manassas, VA, USA) and stored
in liquid nitrogen until use. Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37C in 5%
carbon dioxide in air. After three consecu-
tive passages, cells were divided into groups:
untreated (control); 25 mmol/l metformin;
50 mmol/l metformin; 75 mmol/l metformin;
100 mmol/l metformin; and 125 mmol/l met-
formin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA).
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were plated at 2 Â 104/ml/well in
96-well plates, cultured for 36 h, washed
twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
then cultured as follows (one plate/timepoint;
three wells/group): untreated control;
25 mmol/l metformin; 50mmol/l metformin;
75 mmol/l metformin; 100 mmol/l metformin;
and 125mmol/l metformin. Cells in each
group were cultured for 12 h, 24h and 36 h.
Cell proliferation was quantified via
CCK-8 assay, according to the manufac-
turer's instructions (Dojindo, Kunamoto,
Japan). Optical density (OD) was measured
three times at 450 nm, and growth inhibiting
rate was calculated as: (OD experimental
group ­ OD blank)/(OD control group ­
OD blank) Â 100%.
Real time qRT­PCR
Cells were incubated with metformin
(25 mmol/l, 50 mmol/l, 75 mmol/l and
100 mmol/l) for 24 h. Total RNA was
extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was
synthesized using the poly-A tailing
method.17 PCR was performed for miR-21-
5p with U6 RNA as internal reference, using
a miRNA qRT­PCR detection kit
(FulenGen Corporation, Guangzhou,
China) Primer sequences were: miR-21 for-
ward 50-GAAATGCCTCACAGCTAT
CGT-30 and reverse 50-CCTCCACAAAG
AGCCACC-30; U6 forward 50-ATCATG
TTTGAGACCTTCAACA-30 and reverse
50-CATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCA-30
(Sangon Biotech Corporation, Shanghai,
China). Cycling conditions were 10 min at
95C, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 10 s,
60C for 20 s, and 72C for 10 s. PCR for
PDCD4 was performed using a SYBRÕ
Green I real time qPCR (Roche
Corporation, Basel, Switzerland) with
b-actin as internal reference. Primer
sequences were: PDCD4 forward, 50-CCC
GAGGGATTCTGAAGGAAG-30 and
reverse, 50-TCACCGGAAAAGAGAGAG
TCAC-30; b-actin forward, 50-AGTTGCG

Cycling conditions were 95C for 20 s, fol-
lowed by 40 cycles of 95C for 3 s, and 55C
for 30 s. All PCR experiments were per-
formed in triplicate. Expression levels of
PCR targets in experimental groups were
determined relative to control cultures using
the 2ÀÁÁCt method.
Western blot
Cells were incubated with metformin
(25 mmol/l, 50mmol/l, 75mmol/l and
100 mmol/l) for 24h, washed twice with
PBS, and lysed with RIPA buffer
(Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) on ice for
30min. Lysates were centrifuged at
12000 Â g for 5 min at 4C, and the protein
concentration of the supernatant was deter-
mined using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime).
Total protein (40 mg) was separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, and blocked with 5%
skimmed milk at room temperature for 2 h.
Membranes were incubated overnight at 4C
with mouse monoclonal antihuman-b-actin
antibody (1: 1000 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or
rabbit polyclonal antihuman PDCD4 anti-
body (1 : 2000 dilution; Abcam Corporation,
Cambridge, UK), washed three times with
tris buffered saline­Tween 20, then incubated
at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish
peroxidase labelled goat antirabbit or goat
antimouse secondary antibody (1 : 5000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunoreactive protein bands were
detected using an enhanced chemilumines-
cence (ECL) kit, according to the manufac-
turer's instructions (Beyotime) and
quantified via densitometric analysis using
software Image J (Image Processing and
Analysis in Java). All assays were performed
in duplicate.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as meanÆ SD. Between
group differences were analysed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
multiple group comparisons and Student­
Newman­Keuls q-test for paired compari-
son. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. A
P-value< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant

cell proliferation in a dose- (P < 0.05) and
time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). There
was no significant difference in cell prolifer-
ation between 100 mmol/l and 125 mmol/l
metformin at any timepoint.
Incubation with metformin for 24h signifi-
cantly inhibited miR-21-5p expression (each
dose P< 0.05 vs control; Table 2). Levels of
PDCD4 mRNA (each dose P< 0.01 vs con-
trol; Table 2) and protein (each dose P< 0.05
vs control; Table 2) were significantly upregu-
lated by incubation with metformin.
Discussion
Metformin has been shown to activate the
adenosine monophosphate activated protein
kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway and
inhibit the activity of the downstream
related enzyme in vivo, thereby regulating
the metabolism of glucose and lipids.18
Studies have showed that metformin can
significantly inhibit the growth and prolifer-
ation of a variety of tumour cells
in vitro.11­14 It has been reported that
metformin slows bladder cancer progression
by inhibiting stem cell repopulation through
the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis in both
animal and cell models.19 The drug may
also be used as an adjuvant in combination
with antiproliferative modalities to improve
the outcome of patients with obesity-
activated thyroid cancer.20 In one study,
low doses of metformin were able to reduce
proliferation of certain glioblastoma cells,21
and it has been postulated that it may have a
role in the prevention and management of
urological malignancies.22 In addition, met-
formin has been shown to inhibit prostate
cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion
and tumour growth mediated by upregula-
tion of pigment epithelium-derived factor
(PEDF) expression.23 Furthermore, metfor-
min had an effect on progenitor/stem cells in
a chemoprevention setting, and is being
investigated as a potential early intervention
in patients with chronic liver disease at high
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.24 Another
study has reported that metformin inhibits
the proliferation of human keratinocytes by
regulating the MAPK and Akt signalling
pathways.25 The results of our study showed
that 25­100 mmol/l metformin significantly
suppressed the proliferation of human hypo-
pharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu) in a
dose- and time-dependent manner over 12
to 36 hours.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of
endogenous, single-stranded non-protein-
coding RNAs (14­24nt) that regulate the
expression of target genes at a posttranscrip-
tional level, and play a vital role in cell
differentiation, biological development and
disease occurrence and progression.26­28
Several miRNAs are located in tumour sus-
ceptibility loci, and their abnormal expres-
sion has a close relationship with cell
cancerization. For example, miR-21-5p is

thought to be a cancer-causing gene as it is
upregulated in a variety of tumours and
participates in the abnormal differentiation,
proliferation and apoptosis of tumour cells.15
Studies have reported that there are many
downstream target genes of miR-21-5p,
including PDCD4,29 a proapoptotic factor
and tumour suppressor gene.30,31 The abnor-
mal expression of miR-21-5p and PDCD4
has been shown to play a vital role in the
pathogenesis, progression and metastasis of a
variety of tumours, such as renal cancer,
multiple myeloma and gastric cancer.32­34
Levels of miR-21-5p RNA and PDCD4
mRNA and protein in FaDu cells were
significantly affected by treatment with met-
formin in the present study. Metformin
significantly downregulated miR-21-5p, and
upregulated PDCD4 mRNA and protein,
while significantly inhibiting cell proliferation.
A limitation of this study is that these in vitro
findings may not be representative of the
in vivo environment. Further in vivo studies
are therefore required to validate our findings.
In conclusion, metformin inhibited the
proliferation of FaDu cells in vitro. This
may be associated with the downregulation
of miR-21-5p expression and the upregula-
tion of PDCD4 expression.
