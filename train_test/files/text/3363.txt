Introduction
Feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL) is considered the most com-
mon hepatobiliary disease in cats.1­3 Clinical signs include
lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, icterus and often vomiting
and constipation. Histologically, it is characterised by the
excessive accumulation of triglycerides in more than 60%
of hepatocytes, resulting in secondary impairment of liver
function and intrahepatic cholestasis.2,4 The histological
feature of FHL is that of simple steatosis and the current
literature suggests that the disease lacks necroinflamma-
tory lesions and fibrosis.4,5 FHL often presents as an acute
critical syndrome that can result in the cat's death if thera-
peutic measures are not rapidly implemented. Its progres-
sion into steatohepatitis and chronic liver failure has not
been documented in cats.1,2

Abstract
Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the cellular and stromal components of the hepatic progenitor cell
niche in feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL).
Methods Immunohistochemical staining for the progenitor/bile duct marker (K19), activated Kupffer cells (MAC387),
myofibroblasts (alpha-smooth muscle actin [-SMA]) and the extracellular matrix component laminin were used on
seven liver biopsies of cats with FHL and three healthy cats. Double immunofluorescence stainings were performed
to investigate co-localisation of different cell types in the hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) niche.
Results HPCs, Kupffer cells, myofibroblasts and laminin deposition were observed in the liver samples of FHL,
although with variability in the expression and positivity of the different immunostainings between different samples.
When compared with the unaffected cats where K19 positivity and minimal -SMA and laminin positivity were seen
mainly in the portal area, in the majority of FHL samples K19 and -SMA-positive cells and laminin positivity were seen
also in the periportal and parenchymatous area. MAC387-positive cells were present throughout the parenchyma.
Conclusions and relevance This is a preliminary morphological study to describe the activation and co-localisation
of components of the HPC niche in FHL. Although the HPC niche in FHL resembles that described in hepatopathies
in dogs and in feline lymphocytic cholangitis, the expression of K19, -SMA, MAC387 and lamin is more variable
in FHL, and a common pattern of activation could not be established. Nevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a
spatial association between HPCs and their niche could be demonstrated.

Mature liver cells, ie, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes,
have a remarkable capacity to proliferate and restore
liver function in homeostasis and in response to injury.6­8
Three decades ago `the streaming liver hypothesis' was
proposed based on pulse-chase experiments: peripor-
tally derived hepatocytes migrate along the central vein
to the hepatic vein axis.9 Recent cell-tracing experiments
demonstrated a population of proliferating and self-
renewing cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver
lobule. These cells seem to be able to replace all hepato-
cytes in the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal.10
These experiments helped the understanding of liver
regeneration and the importance of specific hepatic
stem- or progenitor cells (HPCs), as recently reviewed.11,12
Irrespective of the origin of HPCs, once the ability of
hepatocytes to restore liver mass and function is
exhausted or impaired, HPCs become activated, as has
been described for several species.8,13­18 These quiescent
HPCs reside in the smallest branches of the biliary tract,
also known as the canal of Hering, and are recognised by
their morphological appearance, portal location, and
expression of specific markers, such as cytokeratin 7 (K7)
and keratin 19 (K19).6,14,19­21 Once activated, HPCs prolif-
erate and their expansion results in the formation of his-
tological structures known as ductular reactions, also
known as bile duct proliferation.14
There are few descriptions of HPCs in cats.15,22,23 The
first study that reported on progenitor cells in healthy
cats was the study by Ijzer et al in 2009.15 Those progeni-
tor cells were described as small, periportally located
cells positive for K7, with a morphology and location
identical to resident HPCs located in the canal of Hering,
as described in humans and dogs.14,15,24 The same study
identified the presence of ductular structures (ductular
reaction) in different types of feline liver disease (acute
hepatitis, neutrophilic and lymphocityc cholangitis and
lipidosis), and characterised their histological and phe-
notypical features similarly to what has been described
in humans and dogs.8,13,15­18,23­28 However, the simple
description of the ductular reaction does not further
implicate the activation and co-localisation of the HPCs
and their niche.29
The balance between HPC self-renewal, proliferation
and differentiation is determined by the interaction
between the cells and stroma present in the microenvi-
ronment, ie, the `HPC niche'.30­32 In rodent models,
humans and dogs, important cellular components in this
niche include HPCs, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), their
differentiated counterparts, alpha-smooth muscle actin
(-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts and macrophages/
Kupffer cells with laminin as the main stromal compo-
nent.6,7,19,24,33 Laminin is important for HPC proliferation
and maintenance of the progenitor phenotype. Once the
HPCs have left the laminin-enveloped niche, they can
differentiate into a hepatocyte phenotype.34
In humans and dogs the ductular reaction and the
degree of HPC and its niche activation is directly related
to the severity of disease,17,35,36 indicated by the amount
of hepatocyte loss, the amount of inflammation and the
extent of fibrosis, and it is seen in diseases like acute
hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, biliary disease and hepatic
tumours.13,17,24,27,28,36­42
In a recent publication, the remodelling and activa-
tion of the HPCs and their niche was described in feline
lymphocytic cholangitis.43 The characteristics of the
HPCs and their niche in feline lymphocytic cholangitis
share similarities to the HPCs and their niche in scleros-
ing cholangitis in human medicine.
In human and rodent models of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) steatosis is sufficient to inhibit
replication of mature hepatocytes and to trigger the acti-
vation of HPCs.17,18 There is growing evidence that stea-
tosis per se is associated with the development of
steatohepatitis and fibrosis, and should not be consid-
ered just an innocent bystander in liver disease.44­46
To our knowledge, there is no literature available for
cats on the changes of the HPCs and their niche in FHL.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the cel-
lular and stromal pattern of the HPC niche in FHL, with
emphasis on MAC387-positive Kupffer cells, -SMA-
positive myofibroblasts and the important extracellular
matrix component laminin. To substantiate the immuno-
histochemical data we further used double immunofluo-
rescence to investigate possible co-localisations of the
various cell types within the HPC niche.
Materials and methods
Samples of diseased livers were obtained from cats sub-
mitted for routine post-mortem examination. Normal
livers from healthy cats were obtained from fresh cadav-
ers of non-liver-related studies as required under the
University 3R policy. Projects were approved by the
Animal Welfare Committee on Experimental Animal
Use, as required by Dutch legislation.
Seven liver specimens (formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded) with a histological diagnosis of FHL were
selected from the archives of the Department of
Pathobiology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Utrecht University, The Netherlands. The seven FHL sam-
ples demonstrated a severe degree of lipidosis (>70% of
hepatocytes involved), based on histological evaluation
performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist
(GCMG). In one sample extensive lipidosis coincided with
a histological diagnosis of peracute hepatitis. No other
liver comorbidities were present in the six other FHL sam-
ples. Diagnoses were based on criteria as reported previ-
ously by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.47
Tissue samples from three healthy cats were taken
post-mortem and processed similar to the FHL samples.
Sections (3 m) of all samples were cut for haematoxylin
Valtolina et al 3
and eosin and immunohistochemical and immunofluo-
rescence staining. The samples were confirmed histolog-
ically normal by the same board-certified veterinary
pathologist (GCMG).
Immunohistochemistry
All FHL and control samples were examined immuno-
histochemically for the expression of K19 (marker of bile
duct and progenitor cells),27 MAC387 (myelomonocytic
antigen; marker of infiltrated and resident mac-
rophages),22,48 -SMA (marker of activated hepatic stel-
late cells/myofibroblasts),27,34 laminin (extracellular
matrix component and part of the HPC niche)34 and Ki67
(proliferation marker),23 to characterise the HPC niche in
cats (Table 1).
The immunohistochemical procedure was per-
formed as described previously.23,49 Briefly, sections
were deparaffinised and rehydrated in xylene and a
graded alcohol series, respectively. After antigen
retrieval, endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with a
ready-to-use peroxidase block (Dako). Sections were
blocked with 10% normal goat serum and the primary
antibody was diluted in antibody diluent (Dako) and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at
4°C, depending on the marker (Table 1). EnVision
horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies
(anti-rabbit or anti-mouse; Dako) were used and
3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for
visualisation. Sections were counterstained with
haematoxylin. As a negative control, the primary anti-
body was omitted and the IgG1 isotypes served as
internal non-specific controls for each other. For wash-
ing steps PBS/Tween 0.1% was used.
The stainings for K19, Ki67, -SMA and laminin were
scored by one operator at high (40×) magnification. Five
random fields were observed for positively stained
hepatocytes and myofibroblasts, and the number of pos-
itive cells/fields were reported. Only the cells that
displayed nuclei on the section were considered. A dis-
tinction was made within initial scoring for portal,
periportal and parenchymal cell positivity for K19,
-SMAand laminin. To perform a cell count for MAC387,
ImageJ was used, a Java-based image processing pro-
gram from the National Institutes of Health. Images of a
representative slide were made using an Olympus
ColorviewIIIu digital camera and an Olympus BX41
microscope. Cells that stained positive for MAC387 were
reported as total cells per total area analysed (mm2) for
each sample.
Double immunofluorescence staining
To evaluate the spatial relationship between mac-
rophages, activated HSCs, laminin, and HPCs double
immunofluorescence staining was performed on three
samples of cats with FHL showing varying K19 positiv-
ity. The decision not to include double immunofluores-
cence on healthy samples was related to the fact that the
positivity to -SMA and laminin in healthy samples was
almost negligible and mainly seen around the portal
area (bile ducts/blood vessel), as also described in previ-
ously performed studies.15,29
Staining was performed using the aforementioned
markers for macrophages (MAC387), activated stellate
cells (-SMA) and laminin. To detect HPCs, panCK, a
broad-spectrum cytokeratin and well-validated HPC
marker, was used (Table 1).50 Immunofluorescence
staining was performed as described for the immuno-
histochemical procedure. Sections were incubated with
the primary antibodies in a parallel approach overnight
at 4°C. The secondary antibodies (goat­anti-mouse
AlexaFluor-488 and goat­anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 568;
Invitrogen) were applied 1:100, diluted in antibody dil-
uent (Dako). Sections were counterstained using
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 1:2000 for 10 mins at
room temperature, and mounted using Fluorsave. In the
negative controls the first antibody was omitted and
replaced with an aspecific isotype control.
Slides were analysed with a Leica DMRE fluorescent
microscope with Photometrics Coolsnap CCD digital
photo camera and CellB software (AnalySIS; Olympus).

Results
Immunohistochemistry
The results of the immunohistochemical staining for
normal liver and FHL samples are summarised in Tables
2 and 3, and Figure 1 depicts examples of each staining.
Negative controls remained unstained, indicating a spe-
cific signal for each antibody (data not shown). Samples
were considered for the study when at least five portal
areas were evaluated.
K19
In unaffected livers, K19 ­ indicating bile duct and/or
progenitor cells ­ was present in bile ducts and in a vari-
able number of small epithelial cells located in the peri-
portal area (Table 2; Figure 1) confirming the validity of
the anti-K19 antibody. No ductular reactions were
observed. Of the seven cats with lipidosis, four showed
an increase in the number of K19-positive cells in the
(peri)portal area and clusters of cells in the parenchymal
area (Table 2; Figure 1). In 3/7 cases an increased number
of cells positive for K19 staining were seen in the
(peri)portal areas and a positive staining for parenchy-
mal ductular reactions was observed in one case.
-SMA
-SMA-positive staining, indicating the presence of
HSCs and differentiated smooth muscle cells. In healthy
livers very few cells stained positive and mainly in the
portal area, around bile ducts and in the smooth muscle
of blood vessels (Table 2; Figure 1). In 4/7 FHL samples,
-SMA expression was strongly increased in both the
periportal area and throughout the parenchyma. In 3/7
FHL samples, -SMA-positive cells were increased both
in the portal and periportal area when compared with
the unaffected samples.
MAC387
In healthy livers variable amounts of MAC387-positive
cells were found spread throughout the parenchyma as
single cells with no clear spatial relationship with the
portal areas (Table 3; Figure 1). All FHL samples also
demonstrated variable amounts of MAC387-positive
cells. In these samples, the MAC387-positive cells
formed clusters varying in number from 2­3 to 4­6 cells
per cluster, mostly located in close proximity to the por-
tal area.
Laminin
Weak laminin staining was observed in and around the
portal areas in healthy livers (Table 3; Figure 1). Four of
five FHL samples showed an increase in laminin positiv-
ity in the periportal area, ceasing towards the central
vein. The central areas in all samples were negative for
laminin. One FHL sample remained negative for the
laminin staining.
Ki67
Ki67 positivity was minimal in healthy liver. Three FHL
samples showed a distinctive increase in Ki67-positve
cells, whereas four remained negative (Table 3; Figure 1).

Double immunofluorescence staining
Double immunofluorescence showed that -SMA and
laminin expression were increased and in close proxim-
ity to the panCK/K19-positive cells. Laminin strictly

co-localised with HPCs, whereas -SMAwas also located
at other histological sites. MAC387-positive clusters of
cells were found adjacent to K19-positive cells (Figure 2).
Discussion
This study characterised the feline HPC niche by immu-
nohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining in a
common feline hepatic disease, FHL. The results of the
study demonstrate that ductular reactions observed in
the feline HPC niche in FHL contain Kupffer cells, acti-
vated HSCs (myofibroblasts) and the extracellular matrix
component laminin. This is comparable with other
hepatopathies in humans and dogs, such as acute and
chronic hepatitis, hepatobilary diseases and hepatic car-
cinoma.13,15,16,24­27,32,49 It is also in line with the HPC acti-
vation in feline lymphocytic cholangitis, a chronic feline
hepatobiliary disease.43
In human, rat and murine models of impaired hepato-
cyte replication in NAFLD, simple steatosis is enough to
inhibit replication of mature hepatocytes and to trigger
the activation of HPCs.17,18 Owing to elevated levels of
serum-free fatty acids and insulin resistance, lipotoxicity

is promoted, reactive oxygen species are formed, and
hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis are
induced.18,44,45 This results in an inhibition of the replica-
tion capability of the hepatocytes and stimulation of the
activation of the HPCs. Liver steatosis seems to affect the
gravity and progression of more chronic liver disease.44­46
Although a liver with steatosis is less protected against
inflammation and fibrosis, only a small population of
people affected by liver steatosis will further develop
steatohepatitis and fibrosis.44­46
However, we were unable to demonstrate a definite
pattern between the histopathological presence of lipido-
sis and the activation of the HPCs or the upregulation of
the niche components in all cats with hepatic lipidosis.
Different degrees of HPC activation in FHL were sug-
gested by the variability in the expression and positivity
of the different immunostainings in the different sam-
ples. Despite the presence of severe steatosis (>70% of
hepatocytes affected), this might be explained by the fact
that hepatic lipidosis in cats often has an acute onset and
progression due to a negative energy balance resulting
from a heterogeneous group of underlying diseases,
which may have different secondary effects on the liver.
In the cases with only a minimal number of cells staining
positive, the damage to the hepatocytes could have been
minimal or not severe enough to induce hepatocyte
apoptosis/death and secondary activation of HPCs.
Nevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a spatial
association between HPCs and their niche could be
demonstrated. The result of the double immunofluo-
rescence in FHL cases with an enhanced number of pro-
genitor cells suggested that a relationship was present
between the HPCs, Kupffer cells/macrophages and
HSCs/myofibroblasts
Stellate cells/myofibroblasts are the main producers
of extracellular matrix components in the liver and could
be responsible for the enhanced laminin deposition.34
Recently, it has been suggested that the activated HPCs

produce their own laminin sheet to perpetuate their pro-
liferation and maintain their undifferentiated pheno-
type.34,50­52 The close anatomical relationship between
HPCs and laminin suggests that this may also be true in
cats. In situ hybridisation for laminin mRNA can resolve
this issue.
This is the first study to characterise the feline HPC
niche, HPC activation and the relation of HPCs with
FHL. The low number of FHL cases and the lack of lon-
gitudinal samples limits the power of the study. Staining
differences may have been affected by variations in fixa-
tion and/or storage time. However, the quality control
with omission of the first antibody resulted in negative
staining for all antibodies that were used. Furthermore,
the staining patterns were not identical, despite the use
of similar IgG isotypes and the same secondary antibody
in the stainings for K19, MAC387 and Ki67. This strongly
argues against aspecific staining patterns.
We did not use liver samples collected during life,
because histological biopsies are not routinely taken in
cats suspected to have hepatic lipidosis.1­3 High-quality
biopsies of sufficient size are therefore difficult to
obtain.53 Furthermore, liver diseases in cats are often
associated with coagulation disturbances and haemor-
rhage is a potential complication.1,3,52,53 In particular,
serial histological liver biopsies for the evaluation of dis-
ease progression are difficult to obtain owing to the res-
ervations of veterinarians and the understandable
reluctance of pet owners.52 In addition to this, histologi-
cal liver biopsies are also not necessary for a diagnosis of
FHL.3 Because of the absence of sequential sampling and
the descriptive nature of the immunohistochemistry, this
study does not provide dynamic information and limits
conclusions on cause­effect relationships. Despite these
restrictions, we were able to highlight some interesting
aspects of the HPCs and their niche in FHL.
Conclusions
Based on this study the composition of the feline HPC
niche in FHL and its observed cellular and stromal inter-
actions resemble that of normal and diseased livers in
other companion animals like dogs and in cats with lym-
phocytic cholangitis. However, the feline HPC niche in
FHL shows variability between cats regarding the
expression of K19, -SMA, MAC387 and laminin, and a
common pattern of activation could not be established.
Nevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a co-localisa-
tion between HPCs and their niche could be demon-
strated. It remains speculative whether this variation is
caused by the duration of lipidosis, variations in the
underlying disease or the effect of the therapeutic meas-
ures initiated by the referring clinician.
