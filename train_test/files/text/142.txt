Non-technical summary
The purpose of this paper is to examine firm size as a driver of systematic credit risk
in lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by means of an empirical analysis
based on historical default rates of German SMEs. The dependence of systematic risk on
firm size is compared with the size-dependent capital relief granted to SME lending in the
regulatory minimum capital requirements of Basel II and Basel III. Key contributions of
this paper are the use of a unique data set of SME lending by over 400 German banks
covering both small and large banks and an evaluation of the asset correlations as a
measure for systematic risk in the context of current regulatory capital requirements.
Since regulatory capital requirements can affect the interest margins required by the
lender, only their appropriate risk sensitivity will ensure an optimal credit supply.
We find that the relative differences between the capital requirements for large corporates
and those for SMEs (in other words, the capital relief for SMEs in Basel II) are in
two cases lower in the current regulatory framework than implied by the empirically
estimated asset correlations: (1) In the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach this
difference amounts to up to 24 percentage points on average across rating categories. This
concerns only SME loans in the corporate portfolio. (2) For all loans assigned to the SME
portfolio in the Revised Standardized Approach (RSA), this effect is considerably stronger.
Before interpreting these results as an indication to lower international regulatory capital
requirements, one should also consider the deliberately more conservative calibration of
the less risk-sensitive RSA (compared with the IRB approach) and the Germany-specific
robustness of the credit quality of SMEs within the sample period.

Abstract
Our paper addresses firm size as a driver of systematic credit risk in loans to small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). Key contributions are the use of a unique data
set of SME lending by over 400 German banks and relating systematic risk to
the size dependence of regulatory capital requirements. What sets our sample
apart is its comprehensive coverage of the particularly rich and well developed
credit market for SMEs in Germany. We estimate asset correlations as the key
measure of systematic risk from historical default rates. Our results suggest that
systematic risk tends to increase with firm size, conditional on the respective rating
category. We also compare the size of this effect with the capital relief that has been
granted in Basel II for SMEs relative to large firms. For SME loans in the corporate
portfolio of the Internal Ratings-Based Approach and also for SME loans treated
under the revised standardized approach of Basel II, our asset correlation estimates
suggest a significantly larger relative difference from large firms than reflected in
the regulatory capital requirements.

1 Motivation and Overview
Our paper belongs to a well-established strand of empirical work on the systematic risk in
loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We explore in particular the dependence
of systematic risk on firm size and compare the size of this effect with the capital relief
granted to SME lending in the regulatory minimum capital requirements of Basel II.1
Another key contribution is the use of a unique data sample of SME lending by over
400 German banks. What sets this sample apart is its comprehensive coverage of the
particularly rich and well-developed credit market for SMEs in Germany, the availability
of banks' internal ratings, and the capture of the recent financial crisis in the time series.
The asset correlation is used as the key measure of systematic risk. It also drives the
systematic risk in the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) model of Gordy (2003) that
is the basis of the regulatory minimum capital requirements in the Internal Ratings-Based
Approach (IRBA) of Basel II.
The asset correlation is estimated in the first step from historical default rates by the
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimator of Gordy and Heitfield (2002). In the second step
and based on the asset correlation estimates, the dependence of capital requirements
on firm size is compared both with the dependence implicit in the current IRBA risk
weight functions and with risk weights in the Revised Standardized Approach (RSA).2
For this purpose we consider the relative reduction in systematic risk which is measured
as a capital requirement in the ASRF model, with respect to large firms. Thereby, our
study also contributes to the empirical question of an appropriate (relative) calibration
of regulatory capital requirements for SME lending.
For our analysis it is important to separate a potentially higher firm-specific (idiosyncratic)
risk of SMEs ­ that is typically reflected in higher default probabilities ­ from a potentially
lower systematic risk of SMEs. Since capital requirements in the ASRF model refer
by construction only to systematic risk, lower asset correlations (and therefore lower
systematic risk) compared with large firms would ceteris paribus also suggest lower
calibrated capital requirements for SMEs. Capital requirements of an SME loan in the
IRBA depend on both, the default probability and the risk weight function that in turn
depends on the asset correlation value. As a consequence lower systematic risk for SMEs
can well be in line with higher capital requirements for SMEs if SMEs have higher default
probabilities, i.e., higher firm-specific risk, than large firms.
1This treatment has been continued without change in the Basel III framework.
2In the IRBA the capital requirements are computed by multiplying the credit exposure by a risk
weight that is a function of the default probability, the recovery rate, the maturity and the asset type of
the loan. In the RSA the risk weight is tabulated and depends both on the borrower type and an external
rating, i.e., a rating given by an acknowledged rating agency. Very often in this paper the terms "capital
requirement" and "risk weight" can be used interchangeably.
1
Our empirical results can also be useful for an evaluation of current regulatory capital
requirements ­ subject to taking into account various conceptual and empirical caveats
that are described in more detail in Section 5. Since regulatory capital requirements can
affect the interest margins required by the lender, only their appropriate calculation in the
sense that they reflect the actual risk posed by the borrower will ensure an optimal credit
supply for the economy. Since SMEs are the backbone of the economy in many countries,
such as Germany, appropriate capital requirements are crucial for economic growth.
In principle, an evaluation of regulatory capital requirements should distinguish between
the level of capital and the relative difference to other asset classes. In the development
of Basel II the second aspect, often referred to as relative calibration, was addressed
first. The level calibration instead was guided by the requirement to keep the overall
level of capital in the international banking system broadly constant when transitioning
from Basel I to Basel II. This was achieved in an iterative top-down calibration, guided
by several quantitative impact studies coordinated by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision.
Our analysis is very much in the spirit of previous analyses that were carried out for
the relative calibration of Basel II. The asset correlations are estimated based on the
ASRF model underlying the IRBA capital requirements. We use large corporates as a
benchmark which means that they are assumed to be correctly calibrated in level. Then
we compare the relative difference of both, capital requirements based on estimated asset
correlations and the current IRBA capital requirements from the capital requirements for
this benchmark. Comparing these two relative differences can provide useful information
for an evaluation of the capital relief for SMEs granted in Basel II.
We have to confine ourselves to this relative calibration since the appropriate level of
regulatory capital cannot be satisfactorily assessed for the following two reasons:
(i) The overall level of capital requirements was determined in the top-down calibration
of the whole Basel II framework, involving also for example the 99.9% confidence
level of the value-at-risk, the scaling factor of 1.06 of credit risk weighted assets,
and the benchmark maturity of 2.5 years. There is no reason to believe that this
very different calibration goal will provide asset correlations similar to the estimates
from time series of default rates.
(ii) The asset correlation parameter in the regulatory risk weight function was calibrated
in order to reflect a certain degree of sectoral concentration in portfolios of
2
representative banks.3 For this reason, any direct estimation based on the ASRF
model would be, technically speaking, an estimation within a wrongly specified
model.
A well-established strand of empirical work now exists on the systematic risk in SME
loans. Although the findings on the level of asset correlations in the ASRF model vary
substantially, they tend to indicate lower rather than higher asset correlations overall
compared to the values used in the IRBA capital requirements. Table A.1 in the Appendix
provides a comprehensive overview of the existing empirical studies on asset correlations.
Further studies are summarized in the survey of Berg, Gehra, and Kunisch (2011). We
distinguish between two strands of empirical literature which lead to quite different results
in terms of the level of asset correlations. The first strand uses historical default rates to
determine default correlations or asset correlations. These studies include R¨
osch (2003),
Dietsch and Petey (2004), D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006), and Bams, Pisan, and Wolff
(2012). These authors generally estimate lower values than the ones used in the IRBA. In
the second strand D¨
ullmann, Kunisch, and K¨
ull (2010) have shown that asset correlation
estimates based on equity prices tend to be somewhat higher than those based on default
rates. Their results are reflected, for instance, in studies by Hahnenstein (2004) or Lopez
(2004).
Several studies which originated from Hahnenstein (2004) also assess the dependence
of asset correlations on size, creditor quality (i.e., rating), and sector. For a sample of
German firms D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006) find that asset correlations increase with size,
but they do not find an unambiguous relation to the creditor rating. In contrast, Dietsch
and Petey (2004) find that for French and German SMEs "asset correlations decrease
significantly on average with the SME size". However, their sample is considerably smaller
than the one used by D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006).
Castro (2012), who distinguishes between sectors, world regions, and rating finds an
"inverse relation between correlation and the quality of the issuer" using Bayesian
estimation techniques. Also, Hansen, van Vuuren, and Ramadurai (2008) come to the
conclusion that asset correlations vary geographically and that the relation between asset
correlations and probability of default (PD) is ambiguous. For certain asset classes, as
opposed to the Basel II predictions, they find a higher PD being associated with higher
asset correlations.
In summary, previous empirical work is by and large inconclusive on the size of the
3Since the ASRF model cannot capture sectoral concentration because of the assumption of the single
risk factor, the asset correlation for the risk weight function was "calibrated" as follows: It was set so
that the value-at-risk of the ASRF model was on average the same as the value-at-risk of representative
portfolios of real banks in a multi-factor asset value model. In this way, the risk weight function implicitly
also reflects the sectoral concentration of those bank portfolios on average.

appropriate asset correlations, although a tendency towards lower values than the ones
chosen for the current regulatory capital requirements is observable.
Our empirical results confirm previous findings that asset correlations increase with firm
size conditional on the rating category. Furthermore, they suggest that the relative
differences between the capital requirements for large corporates and those for SMEs (in
other words, the capital relief for SMEs) are in two cases lower in the current regulatory
framework than implied by our empirically estimated asset correlations:
1. In the IRB approach the empirically observed potential for increasing the difference
in capital requirements between SME loans in the corporate portfolio and large
corporates might amount up to 24 percentage points dependent on firm size. This
could be achieved by adjusting the asset correlation parameters of the IRBA formula.
For SMEs in the IRBA retail portfolio, however, there is no empirical indication
supporting a change of the current minimum capital requirements.
2. For all loans assigned to the SME portfolio in the RSA, the empirical results suggest
a significantly higher relative reduction compared to large firms than reflected in the
current capital requirements. The capital relief potential amounts to values between
15 and 35 percentage points.
Before the capital relief reflected in these figures is translated into a policy message
to adjust the current regulatory capital requirements, several caveats also need to be
considered, which are described in Section 5.

2 Data Sample
2.1 Desirable Properties of the Dataset
The sample should ideally cover as large a part of the entire SMEs and large corporates
universe as possible. Since defaults are rare events and since the sample needs to be split
into several buckets the small-sample noise in the estimation results should be reduced
to the extent possible. Systematic risk is driven by the evolution of the credit cycle over
time; therefore, it can only be measured from time series. Thus, it is important to have
a long time series that covers at least one full credit cycle.
It is also crucial that the definition of default is the same throughout the observation
period since any change in the definition may have a significant impact on the level of
observed default rates and ultimately on the asset correlation estimates. This definition
should ideally be the Basel II definition of default: "A default is considered to have
occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following
events have taken place. (1) The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its
credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions
such as realising security (if held). (2) The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any
material credit obligation to the banking group. Overdrafts will be considered as being
past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller
than current outstandings." (See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006)) Since
this definition is wider than the insolvency criterion4 that has often been used in previous
studies (e.g., D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006)), we expect the number of defaults to be on
average higher and consequently the results to be more robust to small-sample noise in
buckets of low default rates. A recent study by Dietsch (2013) investigates the impact of
different definitions of default on measures of credit risk.
There should be no selection bias of SMEs included in the sample, e.g., by larger SMEs
entering at an earlier stage and smaller SMEs at a later stage. Pooled data of a large
number of banks can also help to reduce any bank-specific bias in the data.
Based on empirical findings regulators chose to make the asset correlation in the IRBA
risk weight functions for corporate SMEs dependent both on the PD and the firm size.
In order to disentangle both dependencies, the sample should be broken down not only
into size buckets but also into rating buckets. This two-dimensional break-down further
underlines the need for the total sample to be of a sufficient size.
There should be no structural breaks in the sample caused, for example, by a significant
change of the rating methodology.
Lending policies as well as the cyclicality of the credit risk in SME loans may differ across

jurisdictions, for example, because of economic differences between the SME segments,
structural differences in the capital structure of SMEs, different lending policies (e.g.
relationship oriented banking vs. transaction oriented banking), or legal differences, e.g. in
the insolvency code. Since our results pertain only to the German SME sector, an analysis
on a country-by-country basis is required before generalizing the outcome to SME sectors
of other countries.
2.2 Data Description
The data that have been provided by both small and large German banks feature the
desirable properties listed in the previous subsection. They comprise submissions by
more than 400 banks and cover the time period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December
2011. Defaults are counted for 14 semi-annual periods starting at the end of June and
the end of December, respectively. In each considered time period our sample on average
includes approximately 250,000 rated borrowers. Although the vast majority of banks
have adopted the RSA, their rating systems have been designed along the requirements of
an IRBA rating system. The considered creditors include all domestic firms (except credit
institutions) for which an IRBA PD has been available. Retail and specialized lending
are not considered.
Default rates for certain rating-size buckets exhibit semi-annual seasonality due to
banks' provisioning policy. Thus, the underlying time series have to be seasonally
adjusted. Since the data set contains only 14 half-yearly observations for every rating-size
bucket, it is challenging to identify the seasonal pattern. In this regard, we apply the
difference-from-moving-average method to seasonally adjust the time series. In order to
avoid overadjustment during the financial crisis (second half year of 2008, both half years
of 2009), these outliers are excluded from the estimation of the moving average. It should
be noted, however, that all data points are seasonally adjusted and visual inspection of
the new time series confirms the high quality of this approach.
In our sample every observation includes two figures: the number of borrowers at the
beginning of the respective period in the respective bucket, and the number of defaults
up to the end of that period. Buckets are built in three dimensions: yearly turnover,
rating, and time.5 If a borrower is included in the credit portfolio at the beginning of
the semi-annual horizon and its credit is redeemed in the following half year, the credit is
counted as 0.5 for the number of credits. Nevertheless this effect is minor. The upper panel
of Figure 1 shows the number of borrowers and the lower panel the number of defaults
with respect to the rating category. The increase in numbers in the first two semi-annual

buckets quite flexibly if the number of observations becomes too low for robust estimation results.

periods is clearly due to the step-by-step adoption of the rating methodology by the banks
in 2004­2005. The fluctuation of the number of defaults is indicative for point-in-time or
"hybrid" PDs, i.e., PDs that follow a mixture between a pure point-in-time and a pure
through-the-cycle concept.
Figure 1: Semi-annual number of borrowers and defaults with respect to rating
category

(b) Number of defaults
The rating buckets are defined according to the size and the rating of the borrower. Rating
categories are determined by a master scale invented by the Joint Banking Initiative for
the Financial Location of Germany (2010) (IFD). Its original purpose was to improve
7
the transparency of IRBA ratings and to enable borrowers to compare their own rating
across banks. This master scale comprises six rating classes I to VI with I being the
best rating. The different rating systems of each bank in Germany can be converted
into the IFD system. The sample period of seven years covers the recent global financial
crisis and roughly meets the requirement to include one full credit cycle. However, due
to the robustness of foreign demand from outside Europe and due to special national
arrangements to support the German economy (for example, extensive use of flexible
time arrangements in order to avoid lay-offs, or the temporary introduction of the car
scrapping premium), the sample period does not capture a period of severe recession in
the SME sector.
Since observations are available for half years, the sample in total contains 14 semi-annual
periods in the time dimension. As the data is pooled across many banks it is important
to ensure that double counting of defaults due to two or more banks granting loans to the
same customer is avoided. In our sample, the majority of banks adhere to the "regional
principle" which states that banks are only allowed to serve customers within a specified
region. Therefore, there should be no significant distortion from the double counting of
defaults and the estimations should not be significantly biased. This has been assured via
various robustness checks.
The size of the borrowers is proxied by the turnover which is published in the balance
sheet of each borrower. The following six size categories measured in e million are chosen:
[0; 0.3], (0.3; 1], (1; 2.5], (2.5; 5], (5; 50], and (50; +). Figure 2 illustrates the number
of borrowers for each rating and size bucket. The majority of buckets is sufficiently
filled by borrowers; however, for the higher size categories, the number of borrowers is
comparatively lower.
8
Figure 2: Number of average borrowers with respect to rating and size category
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the number of borrowers and defaults, respectively, over
time in each turnover class. Disregarding the large increase in the number of rated
borrowers in all turnover classes from the first to the second half of 2005, the number
of borrowers has grown moderately for smaller borrowers and increased considerably for
larger enterprises. The number of defaults, as also evident from Figure 1, behaves in a
rather volatile fashion, which can be attributed to the fact that banks usually report more
write-offs at the end of the year.

Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of the default rates for each rating class (upper panel)
and each turnover class (lower panel) over the considered time horizon. The highest
default rates for the total sample are observed in 2005, well before the financial crisis
started. This observation supports the view that German SMEs mastered the financial
crisis quite well. In general, the majority of empirical studies dealing with the estimation
of asset correlations from default rates use yearly data.

In order to validate the robustness of the estimation results based on semi-annual data,
we also aggregate the observation periods to an annual time span so as to conduct all the
estimations with annual default rates. The main difference in yearly data is that they
reduce the variation in the number of defaults over time. This smoothing effect is revealed
in the time series of default rates in Figure 5 which shows the yearly default rates in each
rating category (upper panel) as well as in each turnover class (lower panel).

3 Model and Estimation Methodology
The analysis is based on the widely known ASRF model of Gordy (2003) that is also
the foundation of the IRBA risk weight functions for credit exposures in the banking
book. Default is triggered in this model if the ability-to-pay process Yi
of firm i falls
below an exogenous default threshold i
. Yi
follows a standard normal distribution. It
can be decomposed into the return of a systematic and unobservable factor X and an
idiosyncratic firm-specific part i
:
Yi
=

i
ˇ X + 1 - i
ˇ i
.
X and i
are independent for every obligor i and follow a Gaussian distribution. The factor
loading

i
of the systematic risk factor can be interpreted either as the sensitivity against
systematic risk or as the square root of the asset correlation i
. For this analysis the
common assumption of a constant i
is applied which is typical for such empirical studies
as it allows this parameter to be estimated from a cross section. The Bernoulli variable
Li
describes if a credit event has occurred during the considered horizon (Li
= 1) or not
(Li
= 0). It is important to differentiate between the unconditional and the conditional
default probability. The unconditional default probability of obligor i for the time period
t is defined as follows:
P(Li
= 1) = P(Yi
< i
) = (i
)
where  denotes the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution.
Since homogeneity in the obligor buckets is assumed, the index i for the distance to default
i
of a specific firm is dropped.
In this study the ML estimator advocated in Gordy and Heitfield (2002) is applied for
retrieving the main results. The ML estimator is a very general estimator and allows for
the possibility that obligors in different rating and size buckets may be sensitive to different
risk factors. For robustness tests we employ a Method-of-Moments (MM) estimator6 and
also use annual time periods in addition to semi-annual ones for computing the default
rates (see Appendix A.3­A.5). The estimation methodology is described in Appendix
A.2.
6In addition we also employ the Asymptotic Maximum Likelihood Estimator that has been analysed
by D¨
ullmann et al. (2010) in small samples. The results for this estimator are available from the authors
on request.

Standard errors determined analytically from asymptotic Fisher information matrices are given below in brackets.
In order to evaluate the relative calibration we need to consider that besides firm size
measured by yearly turnover, credit quality, i.e., the rating, has also been found to be
a potential driver of the estimation of asset correlations (e.g., Hahnenstein (2004) and
D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006)). This two-dimensional dependency is also reflected in the
current IRBA risk weight functions. Therefore, we estimate the asset correlation for a
matrix of rating and turnover buckets. This procedure enables us to compare capital
requirements for different size buckets conditional on the rating with the respective IRBA
capital requirements. The estimation results are presented in Table 1. Since the time
periods in the sample cover six months we have transformed the estimates of a half-year
PDh
by the formula PD = 1 - (1 - PDh
)2 into PDs for a one-year horizon. This
transformation is necessary for the analysis of the capital requirements since PDs in Basel
II always refer to a one-year horizon.
The asset correlation estimates in Table 1 tend to increase with firm size when holding the
rating constant. This increase, however, is not perfectly monotonic and more pronounced
in some rating categories than in others. The level of asset correlations never exceeds two
percent and is on average considerably below the asset correlations in the IRBA capital
requirements. A possible underestimation of the asset correlations could result from the
14
fact that for each size and rating bucket the correlations were estimated for well-diversified
portfolios with respect to business sectors. Since the applied time series is still relatively
short at seven years, as already discussed in Section 2, it is questionable whether one full
business cycle is captured in the estimations. If this is not the case, negative biases can
arise in the estimation of the asset correlations. (See for instance Gordy and Heitfield
(2002), Dietsch and Petey (2004), and D¨
ullmann and Scheule (2006).)
In the next subsection we compare the capital requirements in Basel II dependent on
turnover with the estimated capital requirements based on the asset correlation and PD
estimates. Afterwards in Subsection 4.3 we evaluate the estimated capital requirements
with respect to the RSA. The asset correlation estimates depend not only on the turnover
but also on the rating. In the following we account for this two-dimensional dependence
by weighting the IRBA or RSA risk weights with respect to the number of borrowers
in each rating category. The advantage of this aggregation is that we can condense the
assessment of the asset correlation estimates in a single figure.
4.2 Evaluation of IRBA Capital Requirements
We consider the "empirical risk weight function", i.e., the risk weight function based on
the empirically estimated asset correlations, rather than the asset correlation estimates
themselves in order to assess the calibration of the IRBA capital requirements. The
current Basel II capital requirements are calculated according to the IRBA formulas.
Turnovers above e 50 million are lumped together in a single bucket since the risk
weight curve would remain flat above this turnover threshold (for a constant PD). For a
turnover between e 2.5 and e 50 million we have applied the corporate risk weight function
including the capital relief due to the turnover dependence of the asset correlation. The
retail risk weight curve (Other Retail) has been applied for a turnover below e 2.5 million.7
By comparing the size dependence of "estimated capital requirements" (i.e., based on
empirical asset correlation estimates) with the size dependence "hard-wired" into the
corresponding IRBA capital requirements we want to answer the question whether the
size dependence of IRBA capital requirements is appropriate in light of the new empirical
results. For this purpose, and for different size buckets, we consider the relative difference
of the (estimated and Basel II) capital requirements from the corresponding capital
requirements of "large" corporates (i.e., firms with a yearly turnover higher than e 50
7Analyses of the Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonised (BACH) database from the
European Committee of Central Balance Sheet Data Offices support the consideration of the first three
turnover classes as Other Retail since the average ratio of turnover to liabilities of credit institutions
amounts to 3.1 in 2009 and e 1 million is the exposure threshold for the retail portfolio. 2009 is the most
recent final data point.

million) which serve as a benchmark8; by assumption they are correctly calibrated. If
both (relative) differences are negative (indicating a capital relief) and if the absolute
value of the difference for the empirical estimates is higher than that of the difference
for the regulatory numbers, this may be interpreted as an indication that our empirical
results ceteris paribus would support lower Basel II capital requirements for SMEs. Table
2 shows the estimated capital requirements and the Basel II ones in terms of risk weights.9

In order to determine the differences in capital requirements we calculate the relative
difference between each risk weight in all turnover classes up to e 50 million and the
corresponding risk weight for the largest turnover class (benchmark). As an example,
consider the relative difference between the estimated risk weight of turnover class (5, 50]
and turnover class >50 in rating category I-III:
Est,I-III
5-50
=
RWEst,I-III

- RWEst,I-III
>50
RWEst,I-III

=
4.3% - 6.4%

= -32.8%.
The same is done for the Basel II risk weights:
BII,I-III
5-50
=
RWBII,I-III
5-50
- RWBII,I-III
>50
RWBII,I-III
>50
=
62.4% - 67.8%
67.8%
= -8.0%.
8This segment comprises firms with a yearly turnover of at least e 50 million; the size adjustment in
the IRBA risk weight function is zero for this segment.
9Appendix A.2.3 shows the empirical risk weight function based on estimated PDs and asset
correlations.
16
Doing this for each risk weight gives us the following reductions for the estimated and the
Basel II capital requirements:

Since the dependence of capital requirements on size and rating based on the asset
correlation estimates is compared with the dependence implicit in the current IRBA risk,
total differences are considered and presented in Table 4. Total differences of capital
requirements with respect to the benchmark "large corporates" are simply the absolute
differences of the relative differences of the estimated capital requirements and the relative
differences within Basel II. Again using the example of turnover class (5, 50] and rating
category I-III the total difference of capital requirements amounts to

The total differences in Table 4 vary to some extent, which means that it is difficult to
draw essential conclusions from this representation. Thus, for an overall assessment of
these results, average total differences of the capital requirements are applied in terms of a
weighted average of all total differences for each turnover class using weights with respect
to the number of loans per rating class. Table 5 shows all weights for each turnover class.

By weighting the total differences with the number of obligors for each rating category,
a representative number of possible differences between Basel II and the empirical
estimations for each turnover class is obtained in Table 6. For example, the average
total difference in capital requirements for the size category (5, 50] is obtained as

Average total difference 6.6 2.8 9.2 -21.8 -23.6 0.0
Table 6 shows that the average total differences for the corporate portfolio and the retail
portfolio move in different directions. For the retail portfolio, the gap between both
relative differences from the benchmark is positive but below ten percent. We define
average total differences below this threshold as economically insignificant. In contrast,
for all SME loans assigned to the corporate portfolio, the capital requirements of the
estimated curve show significantly higher negative differences than Basel II does with a
gap of about 22 percentage points.
These results for the IRBA indicate that there is a potential for increasing the relative
distance between the capital requirements for SME loans in the corporate portfolio and the
capital requirements for loans to larger corporates. This could be achieved, for example,
by providing a capital relief for lowering the risk weights of SMEs relative to their current
treatment only for a certain turnover class or by adjusting the asset correlation parameters
of the IRBA formula. In general, the results of Table 6 are not surprising and confirm
a perception already discussed when the Basel II framework was designed, namely that
splitting the SMEs between the corporate portfolio and the retail portfolio gave rise to a
cliff effect between both portfolios.
4.3 Evaluation of Capital Requirements in the Standardized
Approach
In this subsection we compare the relative level of capital requirements implied by the
asset correlation estimates with the RSA capital requirements. Table 7 calculates the
average total differences in the RSA. The RSA risk weight function is simply a step
function with a risk weight of 100% if the firm is treated as a corporate exposure and 75%
if it is assigned to the retail portfolio, i.e., if the exposure to the borrower does not exceed
e 1 million which is comparable with a turnover of up to e 2.5 million (see footnote 7).
The results for the RSA are considerably stronger and economically more significant than
those for the IRB approach. The estimated capital requirements differ to a much greater

extent from the benchmark "large corporates" (-34% up to -47%) than the regulatory
figures (0% up to -25%). For SMEs in the corporate portfolio, the results are directionally
in line with those for the IRBA, but the average total differences are higher up to a level
of 35 percentage points. In comparison to the corporate portfolio, the empirical results for
the SME loans in the retail portfolio indicate a lower but economically significant capital
relief potential between 15 and 22 percentage points. To sum up, for all loans assigned
to the SME portfolio, the empirical results suggest that the relative reduction compared
to large firms is significantly higher than reflected in the current capital requirements.
Before these results are interpreted in terms of a policy message, it needs to be considered
that the RSA is less risk-sensitive than the IRB approach in general which justifies a more
conservative calibration. The robustness checks conducted support our results for possible
capital reliefs for SMEs and show to some extent higher effects. (Appendix A.3­A.5)
20
5 Policy Message
In our paper we have identified two cases in which our empirical results suggest that the
relative differences between the capital requirements for large corporates and those for
SMEs (in other words, the capital relief for SMEs) are lower in the current regulatory
framework than implied by our empirically estimated asset correlations. Since these
average total differences reflect the capital relief granted for SMEs by the regulators they
may indicate ­ in certain cases and if taken at face value ­ a potential for increasing this
capital relief. This would be equivalent to lowering the regulatory capital requirements
for SMEs, for instance by lowering the asset correlation values in the IRBA formula or
by lowering the RSA risk weights directly. Before drawing this inference as the policy
message of this paper, the following important caveats need to be carefully considered:
The RSA was deliberately calibrated more conservatively than the IRB approaches. This
can be explained by the significantly lower risk sensitivity of the RSA and the regulatory
intention to retain incentives in terms of a ceteris paribus capital relief when banks switch
to the more risk sensitive IRB approaches. The more conservative calibration is one reason
why the capital requirements in the RSA are currently independent of firm size, which
is one important driver for the empirically observed lower potential for reductions of the
capital requirements. It also suggests that at least a substantial part of the 15%­35%
difference between the current capital relief in the RSA and the capital relief implied by
our new empirical results can be explained by this original calibration target.
The time series is still relatively short and the use of semi-annual rather than annual
time intervals for measuring the default rates does not remove the limitation that the
development of the German economy is only captured over seven years. The substantial
noise in asset correlation estimates from such short time series has been well-documented,
for example in D¨
ullmann et al. (2010) by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, although
the sample period comprises the recent global financial crisis, the German SME sector
appears to have been surprisingly unaffected.
Since the regulatory minimum capital requirements are harmonized internationally
nowadays, their modification appears reasonable only if the results of this study are
also broadly representative for other countries. This applies all the more since the
development of the German economy during the financial crisis differs positively from
that in other European countries. Therefore, further analyses ­ possibly based on the
same methodology used in this paper ­ appear to be useful, especially for countries which
also have a strong SME business sector. This is left to further research.
The indicated potential for increasing the relative difference between risk weights for
certain size buckets for SMEs and risk weights for larger corporates is derived from the
21
current regulatory minimum capital requirements for large corporates which are assumed
to be correctly calibrated. The assumption to use large corporates as a benchmark is well
motivated since, for reasons stated above (see Section 1), the study design does not allow
us to quantify the absolute level of the minimum capital requirements. One could argue
that a compensation in the overall calibration of minimum capital requirements would be
necessary if the requirements are lowered for specific SMEs, in order to retain the overall
level of capital in the banking system.

A.2 Estimation Methodology
A.2.1 Method-of-Moments (MM) Estimator
The (asymptotic) MM estimator matches the first and second moments of the conditional
default probability with the first and second moment of the observable default rates. The
first moment is estimated by the average default rate, given by
E[g(x)] = Ż
p,
with g(x) denoting the default probability conditional on X = x and the second moment
by the sample variance of the default rate, given by
V ar[g(x)2] = 2
-1(Ż
p), -1(Ż
p),  - Ż
p2,
where 2
(ˇ) is the cumulative bivariate Gaussian distribution function.
A.2.2 ML Estimator
The ML estimator proposed by Gordy and Heitfield (2002) draws on the property that
the number of defaults D in a (homogeneous) obligor bucket with n obligors follows a
binomial distribution in each period, conditional on systematic factor X. The default
probability conditional on X = x is defined as
P(D = d|X = x) =
n
d
g(x; , )d (1 - g(x; , ))n-d .
The ML estimator of  is determined numerically by maximizing the log-likelihood
function
LL(a, b; , ) =
t
log (Lt
(at
, bt
; , )) ,
26
where at
denotes the (T × 1) vector of the total number of obligors for T time periods, bt
the (T × 1) vector for the number of defaulted obligors and

adjustment dependent on the effective maturity M and the PD with
f(M, PD) = (1 + (M - 2.5) ˇ b(PD))/(1 - 1.5 ˇ b(PD)) and b(PD) = (0.11852 -
0.05478 ˇ log(PD))2.
The capital charge is determined by multiplying the exposure at default with the risk
weight and the solvability coefficient of 0.08.
