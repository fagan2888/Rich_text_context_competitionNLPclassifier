Abstract: We investigated whether men's faces contain embedded cues that signal
differences in individual fitness. Data on shoulder-to-hip ratios (SHR), grip strength,
sexual history, and facial photographs were collected from male college students. Female
college students rated the photographs for attractiveness We found a striking relationship
between ratings of facial attractiveness and body morphology. Males with attractive faces
had significantly more masculine, wedge-shaped SHRs. Ratings of facial attractiveness
accounted for over 25% of the variance in this sexually dimorphic dimension of male body
configuration. Male students with attractive faces also had higher grip strength scores, and
more sexual partners. These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence
showing that facial features contain important cues to fitness and hormonal status.

Introduction
Adaptations to life in the arboreal habitat during primate evolution helped shape a
heavy reliance on the sense of vision (see Gallup and Cameron, 1992). The importance of
visual cues is illustrated by the preoccupation that humans have with faces and the
specialized neural mechanisms dedicated to facial recognition. Faces are featured
prominently when it comes to interpersonal attraction and mate choice, and ratings of facial
attractiveness are consistent across different cultures (Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee,
Druen, and Wu, 1995). Even neonates spend significantly more time looking at faces rated
by adults as being more attractive (Langlois et al., 1987; Langlois, Ritter, Roggman, and
Vaughn, 1991). These findings suggest that selection has operated to influence our
perception of faces because they contain embedded cues to individual fitness.
What you see is what you get
Consistent with this position, it has been shown that people with lower fluctuating
asymmetry (i.e., higher bilateral symmetry) have faces that are rated as more attractive
(Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993) and deviations from bilateral symmetry are inversely
proportional to genetic, physical, and mental health (Thornhill and Moller, 1997). Indeed,
more symmetrical faces are found to be more attractive in their own right (Grammer and
Thornhill, 1994; Hume and Montgomerie, 2001) and attractive faces predict body
symmetry even when facial symmetry is masked by only presenting half of the face
(Scheib, Gangestad, and Thornhill, 1999).
People with attractive faces also live longer (Henderson and Anglin, 2003),
providing more opportunity for offspring and grandchildren investment. Ratings of facial
attractiveness have been shown to predict sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm
morphology in males (Soler et al., 2003) and estrogen levels in females (Law Smith et al.,
2006). Ratings of facial attractiveness peak in females when they are in the ovulatory
phase of the menstrual cycle (Roberts et al., 2004). Men who are heterozygotic at the
Major Histocompatibility Complex, and are therefore more disease resistant, are also
judged by women as being more attractive (Roberts et al., 2005).
Little has been done, however, to examine how well faces reflect other sexually
dimorphic traits, such as strength and body configuration. Body configuration also signals
underlying fitness. Singh (1993) has shown that males prefer females with low waist-to-
hip ratios (WHR), a signal of increased fertility. Hughes and Gallup (2003) extended this
analysis by suggesting that low WHR also signals 1) the absence of pregnancy and 2)
pelvic skeletal morphology conducive to easy childbirth. More recently, Lassek and Gaulin
(2006) gathered evidence for a neurodevelopmental effect of differences in the distribution
of body fat as measured by WHR. Fat stores in the hips and thighs are comprised of long
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids essential for brain growth and development. Mobilization
of these fatty acids is conserved for gestation and lactation, times of primary brain growth
in offspring. Consistent with this idea, women with low WHR (more lower-body fat), and
their offspring, have higher cognitive ability scores (Lassek and Gaulin, 2008).
When it comes to short term sex partners females tend to prefer testosterone driven
traits in males, such as broad shoulders and narrow hips indexed by high shoulder-to-hip
ratios (SHR) (Evans, 1972; Franzoi and Herzog, 1987). The importance of these gender
specific body types is highlighted by the finding that individuals with ideal body
proportions evoke more intrasexual jealousy (Dijkstra and Buunk, 2001). Furthermore, a
recent eye-tracking study has shown that WHR is the primary morphological cue used to
determine the gender of figures in motion (Johnson and Tassinary, 2005).
Males with wedge-shaped torsos (high SHR) have sex at earlier ages, more sexual
partners, and more extra-pair copulations (Hughes, Dispenza, and Gallup, 2004). High
SHR males are also more prone to high school aggression and show enhanced handgrip
strength (Gallup, White, and Gallup, 2007). Handgrip strength is a ubiquitous measure of
human health and vitality that is associated with postoperative recovery (Klidjian, Foster,
Kammerling, Cooper, and Karran, 1980) and longevity (Rantanen et al., 1999). In males,
grip strength is positively correlated with number of sexual partners and negatively
correlated with age of first sexual intercourse (Gallup et al., 2007). Although handgrip
strength is influenced by environmental (Geliebter et al., 1997) and developmental (Hunt,
Rowlands, and Johnston, 1985) factors, 65% of the individual differences in grip strength
are due to underlying differences in genes (Reed, Fabsitz, Selby, and Carmelli, 1991),

making it a prime candidate for fitness research. The relationship between handgrip
strength, promiscuity, and body morphology (SHR) among males recently reported by
Gallup et al. (2007) casts a new light on handgrip as a mate choice characteristic.
The current study was designed to determine if female ratings of facial
attractiveness in males predict independent measures of strength, body configuration, and
sexual behavior.
Materials and Methods
Stimuli
All subjects were undergraduate college students fulfilling course research
requirements. Thirty-eight males (mean age = 19.1, SD = 2.1) agreed to provide
morphological data including shoulder and hip circumferences, and hand grip strength
measurements. Subjects were asked to squeeze a hand held dynamometer (Lafayette
Instruments Model 78010) as hard as they could. Grip strength (in kilograms) was defined
as the maximum of three dynamometer readings for each hand. Shoulder and hip
circumference measurements were obtained following the method of Hughes and Gallup
(2003). A digital photograph was taken of each male's face from the neck up. Facial
photographs were taken against a white background under the same lighting conditions
from a distance of approximately one meter. Males were asked to remove their hats,
glasses, and other accessories that would be visible in the photograph. Subjects also
completed an anonymous questionnaire to determine their age, number of sexual partners,
and age of first sexual intercourse. All participants reported being heterosexual.
Raters
Sixteen female college students viewed a PowerPoint slideshow of a series of male
faces. At a designated computer, females were free to spend as much time as necessary to
view and rate each photograph for attractiveness. All ratings were recorded on a five point
Likert-type scale. To minimize fatigue effects, half of the photographs were presented in
random order to half of the female raters and the other half of the photos were rated by the
remaining females. This resulted in two groups of eight females each rating 19 facial
photographs. Females in both groups were instructed not to rate photographs of individuals
they recognized. Menstrual cycle phase and use of birth control among the raters were
treated as random variables. Cronbach's alpha inter-rater reliability of male facial
attractiveness was .88 for both groups of females.
Results
Descriptive statistics for the different measures and ratings are presented in Table 1.
Morphological measurements and survey data were initially analyzed using two-tailed
Pearson correlations.
Morphology and behavior
Grip strength scores varied as a function of body morphology. Males with more
accentuated wedge shaped torsos (high SHRs) had significantly higher grip strength scores.

strength was also correlated with number of sexual partners (r = .317, p < .05).
Morphology and ratings
Males with higher grip strength scores were independently rated by the females as
having more attractive faces (r = .323, p < .05) (see Table 2 and Figure 2). As shown in
Figure 3, males with broad shoulders and narrow hips (high SHR) were also rated by
females as having more attractive faces (r = .512, p < .01). Females also rated males who
reported more sexual partners as having more attractive faces (r = .360, p < .03).
A multiple regression was employed to determine the unique contributions of each
variable while controlling for all others. Semi-partial correlations between facial
attractiveness and SHR, grip strength, and number of sex partners are shown in Table 3.
When controlling for all other variables, the correlations remain in the predicted direction
and SHR correlates significantly with facial attractiveness.

Discussion
These results show that the way women rate men's faces accounts for a substantial
proportion of the variance in body morphology, grip strength, and sexual behavior among
male college students. Ratings of facial attractiveness accounted for 26% of the variance in
body configuration (SHR) and 10% of the variance in grip strength. Fink, Neave, and
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(3). 2008. -474-
What you see is what you get
Seydel (2007) also found a relationship between grip strength and ratings of male facial
attractiveness.
It is important to note that our facial photographs were taken from the neck up and
did not include the participants' shoulders or any other body features, suggesting that
hormonal and genetic factors that shape morphological indicators of fitness also influence
facial features. Thornhill and Grammer (1999) found that ratings of female faces were
positively correlated with ratings of their bodies, suggesting that faces signal body features
in both sexes. Both the neck and hair were included in the photographs we used to
maintain realistic depictions of the subjects. Whereas it may be possible that the inclusion
of the neck could have affected the results, subjects were given explicit instructions to rate
the face. Future work will be needed to determine whether and to what extent (if any) the
neck may contribute to such ratings.
Consistent with findings reported by Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters (2005), our
results also show that female ratings of male facial attractiveness accounted for a
significant proportion (13%) of the variance in male promiscuity (i.e., number of sexual
partners). Rhodes et al. measured both short-term and long-term sexual partners, body
attractiveness (height and symmetry in males), and facial attractiveness to show that
attractive males have more short-term mating partners. Although not significant, age of first
sex among the males in our sample was related to handgrip strength and SHR in the
predicted negative direction (see Table 2). Because the mean age was only 19.1 (SD =
2.1), the magnitude of these correlations may have been affected by the truncated range of
values for self-reported age of first sex (range = 7 years). We also found a negative (but
again non-significant) correlation between number of sexual partners and the age of first
sex (r = -.18).
Our findings parallel those reported by Hughes et al. (2004) for voice attractiveness.
Both men and women with voices rated as more attractive by members of the opposite sex
reported more sexual partners, more extra-pair copulation partners, and an earlier age of
first sexual intercourse. In addition, having an attractive voice predicted a more masculine
(high) SHR in males, a more feminine (low) WHR in females, as well as lower fluctuating
asymmetry in both sexes (see Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup, 2002). Considered in
conjunction with our results, it would appear that the interplay between hormones and
genes plays a substantial role in molding a `package' of characteristics that signal
differences in fitness. This package includes body morphology (as in SHR and WHR),
physical strength, bilateral symmetry, vocal characteristics, and facial attractiveness.
Do these effects generalize to women? Contrary to Thornhill and Grammer (1999)
who failed to find a relationship between WHR and ratings of facial attractiveness in
females, Brewer, Archer and Manning (2007) recently found that male ratings of women's
facial attractiveness were negatively correlated with WHR. Robust negative correlations
between WHR and ratings of voice attractiveness in females have also been obtained
(Hughes and Gallup, 2003; Hughes et al., 2004).
According to our results and those of Gallup et al. (2007), handgrip strength fits
comfortably into this package. Our findings replicate theirs, showing that handgrip
strength predicts SHR as well as number of sexual partners among men. We also found
that males with a stronger grip had faces that were consistently rated as being more
attractive. This is particularly interesting in light of evidence showing that handgrip
strength is correlated with serum testosterone levels (Page et al., 2005). It is well

established that females in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle find masculine male
faces more attractive (Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink, and Grammer, 2001; Penton-Voak
et al., 1999) and that masculine male facial features are largely testosterone driven (Penton-
Voak and Chen, 2004). These results suggest that handgrip strength is a reliable proxy for
circulating testosterone levels in men. It is important to note that although environmental
factors do affect grip strength, both handgrip strength and testosterone levels are highly
heritable (65% and 56%, respectively) (Reed et al. 1991, Kuijper et al., 2007) making them
prime candidates for screening during mate selection.
Given the historical and cross-cultural prominence of handshake greetings between
men, handgrip strength could also function as a means of assessing intrasexual competition.
Archer and Thanzami (2007) report that males with high grip strength, score higher on
physical aggression and direct aggression scales. They discuss their findings in terms of
the Resource Holding Power theory (Parker, 1974), in which males assess their rival's
abilities prior to making decisions regarding competition strategies. If handshakes enable
males to assess the health, strength, and vitality of newly encountered individuals then grip
strength would be positively selected in males. Unlike males, Gallup et al. (2007) found no
correlations between female grip strength and measures of reproductive fitness, including
WHR, number of sexual partners, and age of first sexual intercourse. They also found that
the distribution of grip strength scores between males and females were virtually non-
overlapping.
In conclusion, our results add to a growing amount of evidence for important
connections between appearance and underlying dimensions of fitness. In addition to
replicating several relationships between morphology, behavior, and attractiveness, we
report a novel relationship between facial attractiveness and SHR, suggesting that these
characteristics should be interpreted as a package that, collectively and individually, signal
fitness. Therefore in a very real sense what you see is what you get when it comes to faces
and bodies, and what you hear is what you get when in comes to voices.
