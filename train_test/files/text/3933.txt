Introduction
Ethical and legal considerations require that human subjects
who participate in research do so under informed consent.
This requires them to receive a detailed, complete, and com-
prehensible description about research objectives, an expla-
nation why they are being asked to participate, and assurance
that their participation is voluntary and that declining to par-
ticipate will not have negative consequences. Processes for
gaining informed consent are reviewed by an Institutional
Review Board (IRB), with attention to the level of risk, char-
acteristics of the target group, and cultural practices of the
population (Faden & Beauchamp, 1986; Gostin, 1991).
Gaining informed consent may be complicated for popu-
lations with low levels of literacy, limited language fluency,
or different cultures than researchers (Kripalani, Bengtzen,
Henderson, & Jacobson, 2008). It may be even more difficult
when working with the elderly, persons in rural areas, or
places where a required signature on a document may cause
anxiety or suspicion about the intentions of those requesting
it (Wendler, 2004).
The importance of informed consent dates back to the
1947 Nuremberg Code, drafted as evidence emerged of
abuse in human-research trials during the Second World War,
and then again in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration. Informed
consent did not become routine practice until the 1960s, and
was not enforced until Pappworth (1967) in the United
Kingdom and Beecher (1966) in the United States published
details of prevalent unethical exploitation of "marginalized
minority groups" in experiments "without their knowledge
or consent." Informed-consent guidelines were first devel-
oped for medical and clinical research, with such guidelines
being more standardized than those for social-science
research (Beauchamp & Childress, 2012).
The issue of attaining informed consent among marginal-
ized populations deserves special attention for several reasons
(Beecher, 1966; Pappworth, 1967). Marginalized populations
have been systematically excluded in clinical research
because of imperfect and culturally insensitive informed-con-
sent procedures, researcher bias (e.g., "belief that minorities
will not agree to participate or adhere to protocols," as dis-
cussed in Barata, Gucciardi, Ahmad, & Stewart, 2006, p.
480), and researcher perception of costs (such as those to

Culturally Competent Informed-Consent
Process to Evaluate a Social Policy for
Older Persons With Low Literacy: The
Mexican Case
Emma Aguila1, Beverly A. Weidmer2, Alfonso Rivera Illingworth2,
and Homero Martinez2
Abstract
The informed-consent process seeks to provide complete information to participants about a research project and to
protect personal information they may disclose. In this article, we present an informed-consent process that we piloted and
improved to obtain consent from older adults in Yucatan, Mexico. Respondents had limited fluency in Spanish, spoke the
local Mayan language, and had some physical limitations due to their age. We describe how we adapted the informed-consent
process to comply with U.S. and Mexican regulations, while simplifying the forms and providing them in Spanish and Mayan.
We present the challenges and lessons learned when dealing with low-literacy older populations, some with diminished
autonomy, in a bilingual context and a binational approach to the legal framework.

translate informed-consent materials, as discussed in Swanson
& Ward, 1995).
Such considerations become more complicated in foreign
countries, where specific requirements and processes for
obtaining informed consent must conform both to the regula-
tions of where the research is conducted and to those of the
foreign partner (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2009). Researchers doing international work may
need creative approaches to comply with requirements from
domestic and foreign IRBs.
In this article, we review efforts to gain informed consent
among participants in an income-supplement program in
Yucatan, Mexico, in a way that was acceptable to both the host
country for the research and the home country of the research-
ers.As part of its social policies to improve the quality of life for
older adults, the Yucatan state government collaborated with
researchers from the RAND Corporation, the a (USC), and
other U.S. and U.K. institutions to design, implement, and eval-
uate an income-supplement program for persons aged 70 and
older (Aguila, Kapteyn, Robles, Vargas, & Weidmer, 2014).
The state of Yucatan occupies the northern part of the
Yucatan peninsula in Southeastern Mexico. Nearly one third
(32.6%) of its population lives in rural areas (Instituto Nacional
de Estadística y Geografía [INEGI], 2010), and nearly half
(45.7%) lives in poverty (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de
la Política de Desarrollo Social [CONEVAL], 2012). Poverty is
higher in Mexico among those who speak an indigenous lan-
guage (76%) than it is among those who do not (43%); Yucatan
is the state with the highest proportion (51%) of inhabitants
who speak an indigenous language (CONEVAL, 2014).
The program included a detailed survey of selected house-
hold members on demographic characteristics, income and
assets, employment history, expenditures on durable and
non-durable goods, family transfers, health and physical sta-
tus, access to and use of health care, medication use, social
networks, social support and caregiving responsibilities,
dietary intake, and food security. For eligible individuals, it
also included anthropometric and selected biomarker mea-
surements (Aguila et al., 2014).
Many individuals had limited literacy, and most spoke the
native indigenous language, Mayan, with only limited fluency
in the national language, Spanish. Many of these persons also
had limited autonomy given their age. In developing informed-
consent processes for them, we paid particular attention to
developing a culturally appropriate process that conformed to
both U.S. and Mexican norms and regulations for conducting
social-science research involving human subjects.
This study expands the scant information previously
available on gaining informed consent among older individ-
uals outside of community centers or nursing homes. Taub,
Kline, and Baker (1981) found that special methods may be
needed to present informed-consent processes to elderly per-
sons with limited vocabulary and low levels of education.
Previous research noted that older persons in nursing homes
have difficulties in providing informed consent, given their
levels of mental competence (see, for example, Annas &
Glantz, 1986; Cohen-Mansfield, Kerin, Pawlson, Lipson, &
Holdridge, 1988).
Method
An Overview of the Informed-Consent Process
Human subjects who are invited as potential participants on
research projects should be considered autonomous individ-
uals, capable of deciding their own acts after deliberating
whether to participate in a project (National Commission for
the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and
Behavioral Research [NCPHS], 1978). As such, they should
be provided with all pertinent information about the project,
including potential risks and benefits, as well as assurance
that their decision will not influence any benefit, such as the
right to health care or government benefits, to which they
may be entitled (Gostin, 1991).
Researchers should ensure that potential participants
clearly understand participation is voluntary, free of coer-
cion, and can be terminated any time without any undesir-
able consequence to their rights (NCPHS, 1978). Researchers
must also take proper measures to protect the confidentiality
of the information collected, including the participant's iden-
tity and any sensitive information that may place the indi-
vidual at risk if it were to be disclosed (Organization of
American States, 2012; Penslar, 1993).
The informed-consent process and efforts to protect pri-
vacy of participants begin before contacting the research par-
ticipants, continue throughout project implementation, and
extend to the use of data and dissemination of results. When
explaining research methods to a potential participant, the
research team must use language and concepts that the par-
ticipant can understand (NCPHS, 1978; Penslar, 1993).
Participants have the right to resolve their doubts and ask
questions about project aims and objectives, possible risks or
expected benefits, and what will be done to address psycho-
logical, physical, or moral harm that may occur as a result of
project participation (NCPHS, 1978; Penslar, 1993).
Once all these issues have been properly addressed, poten-
tial participants may give their informed consent to take part in
the project. Documentation of this informed consent is usually
collected on paper using a digital or hand-written signature
(CONEVAL, 2012). In some cases, participants may waive
written consent but provide oral consent (Klitzman, 2013).
Beyond ethical and moral obligations, informed consent has
legal consequences for participants and the institution respon-
sible for the research (Klitzman, 2013; Penslar, 1993).
U.S. and RAND's Protection for Human Subjects
Participating in Research
In the United States, organizations receiving federal research
funds must have an IRB to ensure compliance with federal
Aguila et al. 3
regulations regarding human-subject protection (Bankert &
Amdur, 2006). Such IRBs must register with the Department
of Health and Human Services. To register, an IRB must
have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of
Human Subjects, which must be renewed every 3 years. The
FWA is the only means accepted by the Office for Human
Research Protections to assure that the institution will com-
ply with federal requirements (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2009).
In line with these policies, RAND's IRB, known as the
Human Subjects Protection Committee (HSPC), is responsi-
ble for reviewing every research project undertaken by the
institution, regardless of the source of funding and project
location. Every RAND researcher must submit a research
protocol for HSPC approval before data collection begins,
usually after funding has been assigned a "fundable" score
(in the case of National Institutes of Health [NIH] projects),
committed or received. Every principal investigator (PI)
should be trained in the protection of human subjects and be
cognizant of HSPC procedures before submitting a project
for review (NCPHS, 1978).
PIs are responsible for preparing the required materials
for submission, responding to any queries raised by HSPC
reviewers, and complying with HSPC recommendations and
regulations before engaging in any activity that involves
human subjects. They are also responsible for reporting any
event that departs from the expected course of the project, as
well as any event that may harm participants in the research,
regardless of whether this is related to research procedures
(NCPHS, 1978). Likewise, every PI is responsible for sub-
mitting any changes to the research protocol initially
approved, whether it is an amendment to project procedures,
a request for approval of any new component to the project
(e.g., a new survey), or a progress report, as long as the proj-
ect is kept "active" by HSPC. After the project is closed, the
PI is responsible for safeguarding signed informed-consent
forms, as well as for protecting participant confidentiality in
presentations or publications of results.
Such responsibilities extend to all staff considered to be
RAND's "agents," including project members hired by
RAND directly or indirectly (i.e., through an in-country sub-
contractor, such as an academic or a public institution). This
requires that local staff involved in any RAND project
receive adequate training in human-subject protection and
adhere to RAND policies and procedures for protecting the
research participants (NCPHS, 1978).
Requirements for Protecting Human Subjects
Participating in Research in Mexico
Government-regulated procedures for protecting human sub-
jects in Mexico have a shorter history than they have in the
United States. Although the General Health Law, which regu-
lates human-based research, established informed consent as
a legal requirement in the mid-1980s (Cámara de Diputados
del Congreso de la Unión, 1984), not until 1992 did the
Ministry of Health establish the National Commission of
Bioethics (NCB). Following a presidential agreement in
2000, the NCB became a permanent body with technical and
operational autonomy (Diario Oficial de la Federación, 2005).
The NCB is responsible for establishing and promoting
health policies related to bioethics, encouraging the creation
of Bioethics Commissions for each state of Mexico, estab-
lishing guidelines and criteria for the activities of these com-
mittees, and promoting bioethics education among health
care institutions (Comisión Nacional de Bioética [NCB],
n.d.). The mission of NCB to promote norms and guidelines
for research ethics committees includes the informed-con-
sent process for social and biomedical research (NCB, 2005).
Every public, private, or social institution that operates
under the National Health System and conducts research
involving human subjects should have a Local Research
Ethics Committee (LREC), equivalent to an IRB in the
United States. LRECs are responsible for reviewing and
applying research ethics to all types of research, but typically
such reviews are reserved for projects that have human sub-
jects (Valdez-Martinez, Turnbull, Garduño-Espinosa, &
Porter, 2006). Institutions that conduct research involving
human subjects are mandated by law to submit their research
protocol to a LREC.
Social-science and biomedical research conducted in
Mexico historically has had little regulation, with many
research projects routinely failing to use an informed-consent
protocol (Garcia, 2009; Lamas et al., 2010; Outomuro, 2008).
Although the commission promotes LRECs as part of its
capacity-building mandate, their establishment is left to uni-
versities, research centers, or other research entities (Comisión
de Salud Fronteriza México-Estados Unidos, 2010).
Complying with the law can take time, so many Mexican
universities and research centers have no LRECs. This is par-
ticularly evident in institutions that do not regularly carry out
research. State-level ministries of health are not required to
(and often do not) have LRECs. At the time of our research,
Yucatan was not among the 20 states (of 32) that had for-
mally established a LREC.
Researchers collaborating with these institutions may find
it necessary to find another institution, such as a local univer-
sity with an LREC, to review their study. There are no guide-
lines for such review, and there is often a disconnect between
the reviewing institution's LREC and the goals and needs of
the proposed research. As a result, the review process may be
long and tedious, often discouraging researchers from going
through it (Comisión de Salud Fronteriza México-Estados
Unidos, 2010). This can make binational research difficult
given U.S. requirements for IRB approval.
According to the NCB (2005), informed consent involves
a social process that should provide information about the
research in an understandable way to the respondent, allow
the researcher to verify that the respondent understands what
participation involves, and provide the opportunity for the
4 SAGE Open
respondent to ask questions and have them answered. The
process must also allow the respondent to decline participa-
tion without being subject to intimidation, coercion, or being
unduly influenced by incentives that could be viewed as
coercive (Aguilera-Guzmán, Mondragón Barrios, Icaza, &
Elena, 2008).
In practice, informed-consent processes in Mexico focus
more on the completion of the consent form as a legal
requirement than on the process of actually acquiring effec-
tive "informed" consent. A shortage in adequate training,
guidance, and supervision of LRECs results in reviews that
focus on rules, regulations, and improving research methods
and analyses rather than on protecting the rights and well-
being of participants (Angeles-Llerenas, Wirtz, & Lara-
Alvarez, 2009; Valdez-Martinez et al., 2006).
Developing Informed-Consent Methods for Our
Project Population
Requirements for our project included asking for informed
consent from participants at each stage of the survey.
Specifically, we asked respondents for their consent to take
part in the general survey (oral), allow the research team to
review administrative and health records (written), and col-
lect anthropometric and biomarker measurements (written),
while assuring informants that we would protect individual
confidentiality. Developing consent forms that could easily
explain the aim of the project to the participants posed a chal-
lenge, given their age, language barriers, low levels of
schooling, and cultural characteristics (Gostin, 1991). We
sought to respect the autonomy of the individuals, especially
given that some participants had physical constraints. The
project also had to comply with both U.S. and Mexican regu-
lations regarding research with human subjects.
To develop the informed-consent documents, we first
reviewed forms previously used in other projects, particu-
larly those similar in scope and complexity and that had used
written rather than oral consent. We developed an initial ver-
sion of the consent forms in English for RAND HSPC
review, then translated them into Spanish.
Before moving into the field, all field staff underwent a
2-week training course on study procedures and selected
aspects of human-subject protection. This course included
practical interview topics, such as how interviewers should
introduce themselves and the project to potential participants,
as well as administrative procedures, including data-safe-
guarding plans and handling of potential adverse events.
Training included theory (lectures) and practice (group ses-
sions to enact interviewing procedures). To promote a cultur-
allysensitiveinteractionbetweenrespondentsandinterviewers,
a local anthropologist gave a lecture to interviewers about
Mayan culture and the role of the elderly in society. Training
was followed by the pilot field-test phase, in which interview-
ers visited homes to collect written informed consent and test
the data-collection forms.
A first pilot test was conducted at a nearby site, in a local-
ity called Progreso, away from the area where the project
was to be conducted. This pilot test involved approximately
200 Spanish-speaking participants and included the applica-
tion of the informed-consent forms as well as the full battery
of planned individual- and household-level data-collection
procedures. We requested written informed consent for the
survey, for access to administrative or health records from
any public program in which the subject had taken part, and
for anthropometric and biomarker measurements.
Participants who signed the informed-consent form were
given a copy for future reference.
We followed the same procedures in each pilot test to
identify issues and challenges of the survey application. The
PI, survey director, local project director, and field coordina-
tor accompanied the field staff during these pilot tests to
observe directly the informed-consent process. Following
each field-test, all project staff held two extensive debriefing
sessions to identify salient issues and major challenges.
The first debriefing session was held the last day of each
pilot test between interviewers and supervisor. Interviewers
reported their findings to their supervisor who made notes
and merged these comments with his or her own observa-
tions during the pilot test. The PI, survey director, local proj-
ect director, and field coordinator also attended and made
notes in these debriefings. The first debriefing sessions lasted
on average 2 hr each. At the end of this session, supervisors
summarized the main issues and challenges for the field
coordinator. The field coordinator, in turn, summarized, by
topic, main issues, and challenges identified in the debriefing
sessions.Areport for discussion was then presented to the PI,
survey director, local project director, and a local researcher
expert on primary data collection. This subsequent meeting
sought potential solutions to the challenges faced in the pilot
test and to highlight items requiring further information.
The second debriefing session summarized the issues and
challenges faced by all interviewers and supervisors, and dis-
cussed potential solutions with all field staff. The second
debriefing session lasted on average between 3 and 4 hr, and
included 35 staff members: all five teams (each comprising
five interviewers and one supervisor), the field coordinator,
local project director, survey director, a local expert on pri-
mary data collection, and the PI. During the first 30 to 40 min
of the second debriefing session, the field coordinator pre-
sented the main issues raised in the first debriefing session.
In the next 60 min, participants provided feedback of addi-
tional items not considered in the summary or provided
deeper insights about a specific item. In the next 90 min,
participants had a brainstorming session on solutions to the
issues presented. The survey director led the debriefings and
organized the discussion. Supervisors, the local project
director, the field coordinator, the local expert on primary
data collection, and the PI all made notes during the second
debriefing sessions. After the second debriefing, the field
coordinator revised the summary of issues and challenges
Aguila et al. 5
with suggested solutions, using her notes and the debriefing
notes of supervisors, the local project director, the local
expert on primary data collection, and the PI. The field coor-
dinator provided this report to the survey director and local
expert on primary data collection, who then made a final
decision on the feasibility of changes to the informed-con-
sent protocol and who prepared a report for the RAND IRB.
The revised forms were drafted in Spanish, and the local
expert on primary data collection helped simplify them
(Aguila, Cervera, Martinez, & Weidmer, 2015). Revised
consent forms and reports of the field-tests were then trans-
lated into English, to be submitted as an amendment to the
report for RAND HSPC.
After the debriefings of the first pilot test in Progreso, we
realized that the informed-consent forms needed to be trans-
lated to Mayan for respondents who could not fully under-
stand the process in Spanish. Bilingual (Spanish­Mayan)
staff reviewed all forms prepared by professional Mayan
translators for content and accuracy. We then conducted a
second pilot test in a nearby town, Teabo, using the Mayan-
language versions of the informed-consent and survey instru-
ments. The translation of the instruments was a major
enterprise that increased project costs but was necessary to
conduct research with the indigenous elderly.
The informed-consent forms were provided in both
Spanish and Mayan to all project participants, who were
allowed to keep a copy for future reference. All interviews
and procedures were conducted in a place that provided com-
fort and privacy for respondents, whether in their own home
or, if respondents so chose, in a place such as a school, church,
or government office. Interviewers made sure respondents
understood that they could refuse to answer any question, par-
ticipate in one component of the project but not another, or
withdraw from the project at any point, without giving up any
state-government benefit to which they were entitled.
Results
During the debriefing sessions held by project and field staff
after the first pilot test, it became obvious that many partici-
pants were intimidated by the consent form and process.
There were three issues causing problems.
First, many respondents, particularly those with low lev-
els of education, were not able to understand the content and
language of the forms. The length of the forms and the time
they took to discuss (as much as 30 min) proved too tedious
for many potential participants. Many became tired, and lost
attention, interest, or willingness to participate. Many of our
interviewers were also unfamiliar with informed-consent
processes. While most held an undergraduate degree, and
30% had participated in previous data-collection projects,
none were familiar with the human-subject protection pro-
cess before our training.
Second, many respondents were illiterate or had poor
vision; hence, they were unable to read any of the forms. As
described by an interviewer, one male participant who lived
alone in the city of Progreso "gladly agreed to participate" in
the project. However, referring to the consent forms, he said,
"I can participate but I cannot sign them because I cannot see
well and I do not have glasses; therefore, I prefer not to sign."
Others who could not read the forms were afraid to sign
something they were unable to read, for fear of being tricked
into something that they could not independently verify. In
some instances, having a family member or a field inter-
viewer read the form out loud helped. Still, the written nature
of the documents posed an obstacle for a number of
participants.
Third, participants were intimidated by the consent pro-
cess and, particularly, signing the consent forms. The lack of
knowledge and understanding of consent forms caused many
respondents to fear that someone would somehow take
advantage of them. In some cases, respondents refused to
sign the consent forms though they indicated willingness to
participate in the study. The requirement to sign document
made them suspicious of the intentions of the field staff.
These suspicions could relate to fears of being duped by,
or associated with, criminals. The words of a female partici-
pant, as recalled by an interviewer, provide an example of
these fears:
I will not sign any documents because I'm afraid that you can
use my information for some illegal purpose, as I had heard on
the news about fraudulent calls being made to old persons in
which strangers said that they have personal information of a
family member and they used them for criminal purposes if they
did not give money.
She also mentioned being wary due to cases she had heard
in which criminals used others'names and signatures to steal
money from bank accounts. The participant had no problem
understanding the project or forms. She simply refused to
provide her signature due to fears of theft and fraud.
In another case of refusal, when asked for her signature, a
female participant said, "No, I'm afraid you guys might take
away my property or belongings." After more conversation
and explanation by the interviewer, she still asserted, "I do
not know, because you could change everything and make
this like a distraction to take away the small valued things
that I have left."
Respondents also feared that "the government" would
take advantage of them. For example, a female participant
who refused to sign the consent form said, "The government
only wants our signatures to get more money, so the people
in the government can continue robbing our money."Another
female participant said,
I detest everything related to the government; if I accepted to
collaborate with you, it's because I care about people like you
who are just doing their job to support your families, but I'm not
going to sign any official document to the government. I do not
want to be associated with the government in any way.
6 SAGE Open
Family members sometimes reinforced such fears,
actively discouraging or preventing their elder relative from
signing the form. They feared that a signature would com-
promise their property or possessions, or waive some privi-
leges related to government-sponsored welfare programs. In
the words of one participant's wife, who supported her hus-
band's decision to participate without signing the consent
form, "We found the study very interesting and we're very
grateful for having been taken into consideration. However,
we don't see any benefit or advantage in other people
review[ing] our administrative and health records." Other
potential participants were reluctant to provide a signature
without the presence or advice from a trusted family mem-
ber: "I am not signing any document without the presence of
my son," one female participant said, "because I do not
understand many things and I am afraid to get into trouble."
To address these issues, we revised the forms to be shorter
and simply describe the project. Final versions of Spanish
and Mayan informed-consent forms can be found at (Aguila
et al., 2015). We also modified the informed-consent process
to promote an exchange of information between the inter-
viewer and respondent. Revised forms submitted to the
RAND HSPC eliminated the requirement for the partici-
pant's signature, replacing it with the interviewer's signature
as a "witness to informed consent." That is, an interviewer's
signature would attest that the interviewer had reviewed the
content of the consent form with the respondent, offered
appropriate answers to any question or concern of the poten-
tial participant, and obtained oral consent from the respon-
dent to proceed with the survey. The forms allowing the field
staff access to administrative or health records were held by
government programs or health providers, and therefore
required an actual signature from the participant. The revised
versions of these forms allowed for a signature or fingerprint
or even for a legally authorized representative to sign when
the participant was unable to do so. In short, we simplified
the consent forms for participation, while maintaining the
basic elements of informed consent required by the HSPC.
We found that it was difficult for the interviewers to intro-
duce the project to the eligible adults, or their relatives, and
to clarify all questions regarding the consent form. We
resolved these problems through more training as well as
positive feedback and reinforcement of interviewer activities
by field supervisors and project coordinators. In our debrief-
ings, we discussed the field-test experience with interviewers
and identified processes or procedures with which interview-
ers experienced difficulty and needed modification. In our
field-test observations, we found that interviewers struggled
with how to present the study to respondents, succinctly
answer questions posed by respondents or their friends and
family, and persuade respondents (or gatekeepers) to sign the
consent forms and participate in the study.
We instructed interviewers to ask for written informed con-
sent for anthropometric and biomarker measurements after the
individual interview, which only required oral consent, was
finished. This allowed the interviewer to establish rapport with
the respondent, and considerably improved the consent rate
for more invasive procedures. Figure 1 shows the flow of the
informed-consent process for the overall project.
Ultimately, the interviewers were able to obtain consent
from a high proportion of eligible individuals. Table 1 sum-
marizes the number of individuals in the two localities,
Valladolid and Motul, where baseline data collection began
in 2007. Overall, 99.8% of the eligible individuals gave their
initial consent in the baseline survey, 94.5% did so for the
first follow-up, and 91.8% did so for the second follow-up.
Consent rates were higher for Mayan than for Spanish speak-
ers across the three waves. The decrease in the proportion of
eligible individuals who completed and gave their consent to
participate in the follow-up survey was due to illness, death,
refusal, or address change. There were no reports of eligible
individuals declining to participate in the follow-up surveys
because of issues related to the informed-consent form.
In Table 1, we can observe the proportion of individuals
who, in Spanish or Mayan, gave written consent for access to
their administrative and health records and for anthropomet-
ric and biomarker measurements. These written-consent
rates were lower than the initial oral-consent rates to respond
to the survey. These differences indicate that respondents
were aware they could provide, or refuse, consent for differ-
ent elements of the process.
Discussion
As noted by Pappworth (1967) and Beecher (1966), the issue
of obtaining informed consent among the marginalized pop-
ulations deserves special attention. Dula (1997) similarly
notes several reasons why implementation of research with
adequate informed consent is especially relevant among eth-
nically and financially marginalized populations. These
include the history of abuse of informed consent that may
cause distrust, particularly among minority populations.
Obtaining the consent of such individuals "calls for commu-
nity consultation, education, and involvement." These can be
difficult to obtain among such populations.
Other studies including minorities have found that trust is
key for survey participation. Barata et al. (2006) examined
cross-cultural perspectives on informed-consent procedures in
medical research among Portuguese Canadian and Black
Caribbean Canadian immigrants. In both groups, the key to
attaining informed consent was the degree of trust or mistrust
arising in the process. The Portuguese considered interper-
sonal trust relevant to participation, while Black Caribbean
respondents reported establishing trust to verify the legitimacy
and safety of the study. The Black Caribbean respondents suf-
fered more fear and anxiety about participating due to mistrust
of the research and because the study could stigmatize their
community. Even increasing participation in the focus-group
session was difficult and only accomplished when a well-
known community member asked for participation.

A number of scholars have paid increasing attention to
informed-consent procedures for indigenous (Native
American) populations. Ellis and Earley (2008) explored the
value of employing culturally sensitive informed-consent pro-
cedures, such as offering asemaa (tobacco ties) symbolizing
reciprocity among different cultural groups. They suggested

that, in eliciting informed consent from an indigenous popula-
tion, researchers ought to go beyond debriefing their research
procedures and build on a more culturally sensitive researcher­
subject relationship that embodies "the American Indian
worldview involving collectivism, collaboration, compassion,
and courage" (Ellis & Earley, 2008; Portman & Garrett, 2005).
Informed consent is especially important for preventing
exploitation of minority participants (Dula, 1997), but over-
protection can lead to a complete exclusion of minorities from
research (Elks, 1993; Smith, 2008).
Informed-consent processes on social research are less
standardized than those in medical or clinical research. Some
researchers (Beauchamp & Childress, 2012; Doyal, 1998)
have argued that social-research ethics should follow medi-
cal- and clinical-research ethics emphasizing the values of
autonomy of subjects, non-maleficence ("Research must not
inflict harm"), beneficence ("Research should benefit oth-
ers"), and justice ("People must be treated equally within the
research process"; Wiles, Heath, Crow, & Charles, 2005).
Social-science researchers (Goodwin, Pope, Mort, & Smith,
2003; Punch, 1998; Wiles et al., 2005), however, have criti-
cized such a strict adherence to ethical principles as not
reflecting the reality of social research where ethical dilem-
mas encountered are highly context-specific. Warnock
(1998), for instance, contended that there could be cases,
such as in conducting research with mentally incompetent
participants, where these principles are breached. Tobias
(1998) similarly suggested that social science demands much
more lenient imposition of informed-consent requirements,
given that informed consent for social research is often dif-
ficult to obtain. As Couture (2008) suggested, in social-
science research the "benefits and costs of informed consent
should be carefully considered in each situation (p. 1)."
The simplicity or complexity of developing adequate
informed-consent procedures depends on the location of the
project, specific cultural or demographic characteristics of
the target population, the nature of the research proposed,
requirements of participating institutions, and local rules and
regulations on conducting research (Chin et al., 2011;
Kripalani et al., 2008). For our Yucatan research, the lack of
a LREC affected both researchers and respondents. For
researchers, this lack made it more difficult to conduct col-
laborative binational research. Such difficulties reduce
incentives to conduct research among marginalized commu-
nities, reinforcing their marginalization.
Adapting the informed-consent process to be more cultur-
ally competent required additional resources and staff train-
ing, and delayed implementation of the study. Doing so,
however, allowed us to conduct successful research with a
marginalized elderly population in a developing country
without international IRB standards or procedures.
Following a dialectic approach, we conducted initial field-
testing with extensive debriefing of the field staff about their
experiences, and used this and local researcher expertise in
primary data collection to restructure our interview forms.
Our pilot test in Spanish helped us realize the importance of
translating the informed-consent protocols and survey instru-
ments to Mayan. One of our subsequent pilot tests completely
focused on the Mayan-speaking populations, helping us adapt
our process to their particular characteristics.
The project would not have succeeded without an itera-
tive process of cultural exchange and adaptation that reflected
true commitment to the ethical principle of respect for per-
sons. One of the key contributors to the success of a research
project of this type is interviewer training. We conducted
comprehensive training sessions to instruct the interviewers
about the importance of the informed-consent process.
Training the project staff about the Mayan culture, traditions,
and role of the elderly in society helped the research team
understand the need to conduct research for this marginal-
ized population. We collaborated with a local expert on
Mayan culture who gave a lecture during field staff training.

The collaboration with our IRB was also key in the rede-
sign of the informed-consent process. Harmonizing U.S. and
Mexican regulations was always a focal point. It may be worth
noting that, at RAND, PIs are regularly invited to HSPC meet-
ings where their projects are reviewed. This allows for interac-
tion and clarification between the researcher and the full IRB
committee. While field-testing of instruments and processes
can be challenging for projects with time and budget con-
straints, we found it to be vital in ensuring that our project was
conducted with both ethical and methodological rigor.
We tried to ease participants'fears of exploitation by allow-
ing for oral or fingerprint consent. We implemented a staged
process of consent. For the interview, we were able to rely on
oral consent, with interviewers signing the consent form, indi-
cating their role as "witness to informed consent." This allowed
respondents to feel at ease with interviewers. It also allowed
interviewers to establish rapport with respondents before ask-
ing for a signed authorization to conduct more invasive tests,
including anthropometry. When dealing with illiterate persons,
interviewers were authorized to collect the signature of a fam-
ily member on behalf of the older relative or a digital signature
(i.e., a fingerprint) from the participant, with interviewers then
also signing as "witness to informed consent."
Conclusion
In this article, we presented the experience of a group of
researchers from a U.S.-based institution involved in research
in a developing country, facing different challenges with the
target population. These challenges included the target popu-
lation's age, physical or mental frailty, reduced autonomy
and privacy, low levels of schooling, and language chal-
lenges. In spite of these challenges, we were able to develop
adequate consent forms, building on previous experience
acquired in our own institution by other research groups fac-
ing similar conditions, and submitting our initial consent
procedures, including informed-consent forms, to several
iterations field-tested in subsequent pilot runs.
One of our most important lessons is that of involving local
experts. Our project, though binational and cross-cultural from
the outset, underwent even more cultural adaptation than antic-
ipated. By approaching this project with a sense of mutual
respect and flexibility, and by partnering with local researchers
familiar with the nuances of indigenous norms, we were able
to adapt our processes in ways that dramatically increased
their acceptability to the target population. Specifically, we are
grateful to a local researcher expert on primary data collection
who participated in field-tests and debriefing sessions that
shaped the informed-consent protocol. We intentionally chose
project interviewers from the communities where they would
be working, and who were able to recognize and explain the
discomforts respondents had with the original consent forms
and procedures. We accommodated participants' cultural pref-
erences by conducting interviews in their native language, with
participation of the whole household.
Overall, there must be ongoing dialogue about whose
authority should take primacy in decisions regarding "best
practices" for informed consent when different stakehold-
ers hold divergent viewpoints. U.S.-based IRB bodies and
federal regulations may have quite different expectations
for consent procedures than LREC. LRECs in turn might
hold very different expectations than the target population
has. Better understanding how to balance these competing
demands and interests is critical as scientific inquiry
becomes increasingly global. Future empirical research
should show how research with vulnerable groups can
align with the ethical imperatives that lie at the heart of
research on human subjects: minimizing harm, maximiz-
ing benefit, respecting human dignity and autonomy, and
striving to distribute equitably the benefits and burdens of
research.
