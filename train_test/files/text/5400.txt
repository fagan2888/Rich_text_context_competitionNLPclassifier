Setting the Context
The secondary school years are quite turbulent for most ado-
lescents, regardless of their families'socioeconomic status or
home neighborhood. Adolescence is a time for identity for-
mation or individuation away from family of origin while
moving toward increased conformity with peers (Erikson,
1968). These two phenomena, individuation and conformity
with peers, often contribute to the confusion associated with
adolescence, a phenomenon conceptualized by Erikson as
"Identity Versus Role Confusion." On one hand, the adoles-
cent wants to establish himself or herself as an independent
entity from his or her parents, often pushing against family,
community, and religious rules and norms. Changes in
appearance, style of dress, music preference, and choice of
friends characterize this individuation. On the other hand,
these same changes become the basis for seeking acceptance
from and conformity with the adolescent's peer group.
Conformity or "fitting in" with peers, sometimes termed
collective identity, takes on enormous significance at ado-
lescence; being different or standing out in any way is seen
as problematic. "Fitting in" can also have an effect on aca-
demic achievement; peer acceptance typically translates
into average academic performance at best. According to
Forham and Ogbu (1986), academic success, especially for
racial and ethnic minority students, may be viewed as
"selling out" to the dominant racial or cultural group. In
other words, being smart as an adolescent may "not be
cool," and for racial and ethnic minority children, may be
seen as trying to gain acceptance by the dominant race or
cultural group.
Achievement gap data between White and minority stu-
dents have been well documented, and these gaps have per-
sistedandwidenedovertime(NationalCenterforEducational
Statistics [NCES], 2015).According to the NCES (2015), the
percentage of 12th-grade students who were proficient in
reading was 37% and for math was 25%. In reading, the gap
in proficiency was 34% between White and Black students
and 11% between White and Hispanic students. In math, the
gap in proficiency was 25% between White and Black stu-
dents and 20% between White and Hispanic students. These
persistent gaps in academic achievement between Whites
and racial and ethnic minorities evident nationally across all
12th-grade students have significant implications for post­
high school study and vocational training. Many of these stu-
dents who apply to 2- and 4-year colleges often find
themselves taking remedial courses during their first year of
college attendance, needing to demonstrate proficiency
before being permitted to take credit-bearing courses. Poor
proficiency in reading and math may derail college dreams,

Strategies to Improve Academic
Achievement in Secondary School
Students: Perspectives on Grit and
Mindset
Susan Polirstok1
Abstract
This article examines the academic performance of secondary school students from the perspectives of grit and mindset
through a detailed review of the literature. What makes a learner resilient? Persistent? Willing to take on academic challenges?
The research on grit and mindset provides an understanding of why many secondary students struggle academically. Whereas
Duckworth discusses persistence and resilience, Dweck compares fixed versus growth mindsets, the willingness to take
on academic challenges and belief in oneself as a learner. Teaching strategies and materials that can help students increase
persistence and build a growth mindset are presented as keys to successfully affecting academic performance.

and can result in students having to pay loans for college
costs without moving beyond the "remediation phase" and
never having earned a degree. Similarly, these students will
be challenged as well when enrolling in vocational training
programs, which require competence in reading and mathe-
matics. Have you ever met an auto mechanic who cannot
read the manual or a carpenter who cannot measure precisely
or convert fractions as needed?
In looking at factors contributing to poor student perfor-
mance at the secondary level, achievement data from fourth
grade and eighth grade are significant data points. As reported
by National Center for Educational Statistics (2015), the per-
centage of students proficient in reading at the fourth-grade
level was 36% and at the eighth-grade level was 34%.
Similarly, the percentage of students proficient in math at the
fourth-grade level was 40% and at the eighth-grade level was
33%. In both, reading and math, student performance at the
fourth- and eighth-grade levels was not significantly different
from scores previously demonstrated in 2013. This is consis-
tent with the findings of Rockoff and Lockwood (2010) on the
decline in performance from early grades (K-5) to later grades
(6-8) and the persistence of these gaps through eighth grade.
There is a convergence of several events when adolescents
transition to middle school during sixth grade. These events,
which include psychological and physiological changes as well
as normative declines in motivation and academic achievement,
make sixth grade an exceptionally important year for the future
success of at-risk students. (Saunders, 2014, p. 4)
During the period of young adolescence when it may be "not
cool to be smart," students who are bright and have strong
skills already developed, may choose to be passive learners,
not demonstrating their abilities and often concealing their
academic strengths for fear of garnering recognition.
In high school, many of these adolescents are able to rede-
fine the group to which they want to belong, choosing a more
proacademic identity. Because high schools are typically
larger and have students drawn from a wider catchment area,
these students have an opportunity to redefine themselves in
high school by making new friends and joining many new
clubs and activities. For them, they have been able to negoti-
ate the early adolescent years with little lasting negative out-
comes. They seem to have matured sufficiently and are more
able to accept academic challenges as part of the overall
learning experience. However, for the group of young ado-
lescent middle school students who are typically close to
failing, the "not cool to be smart" style of operation may
have a significant negative effect on academic performance
and opportunities over time. "Much less attention has been
paid to understanding the magnitude of student disengage-
ment in high-poverty middle-grades schools, its impact on
student achievement, and ultimately the role it plays in driv-
ing the nations' graduation rate crisis" (Balfanz, Herzog, &
Mac Iver, 2007, p. 223).
Grit and Mindset
Carol Dweck's (2007) work on mindset offers good insight
into understanding students who seem relatively closed as
learners, unwilling to take on academic challenges, in com-
parison with others who are open to learning new concepts
and willing to take risks, even as the academic content
increases in complexity. Students who are willing to struggle
with new ideas and concepts are those who Dweck refers to
as having a "growth mindset." These are the students who are
ready to challenge the "not cool to be smart" perspective and
are ready to let people see that they may have to struggle to
learn a new concept or task. What is important to this group
of students is the belief that, through hard work, they will
ultimately be able to master what seems so difficult for them
to learn at any given point. In the face of academic chal-
lenges, they persevere, embodying an implicit theory
(Dweck, 1996) that they will eventually master the new
material. Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews and Kelly (2007)
call this persistence in the face of challenge "grit." Students
who are successful, able to sustain their effort, and ultimately
reach their targeted goal over time are gritty. According to
Hochanadel and Finamore (2015), "It appears that when
teachers teach students how to persist, a growth mindset
develops, thus improving grit to overcome any challenges"
(p. 49). Whether a growth mindset is a function of grit, or
whether grit is a function of growth mindset remains open to
debate, but clearly these ideas are closely intertwined and
can offer a valuable lens into how adolescents may operate
when challenged academically.
For those adolescents who are not willing to take on aca-
demic challenges and who choose instead to be among those
who believe "smart is not cool," Dweck (2007) refers to
them as having a fixed mindset. The fixed mindset is best
viewed as an implicit theory about oneself that is defensive,
not wanting anyone to see into one's real academic abilities
or lack thereof. It may always be better to be viewed as prob-
lematic in terms of one's behavior, rather than to be seen as a
struggling learner. These students, unlike their counterparts
with growth mindsets, do not see intelligence as a factor that
can grow and change in relation to hard work. Instead, they
believe that that intelligence is static:
They have reached the end of their ability or smarts and there is
nothing they can do about it; for such students, avoidance might
be a more rational option, because if they don't try to do
something they feel is beyond them, they can kid themselves
that they have not failed. (Mawer, 2014, p. 50)
According to Saunders (2014), "at-risk students who adopt a
fixed mindset may become trapped in a recursive pattern of
low achievement, low motivation, and low effort" (p. 4). The
long-term impact of having a fixed mindset can be damaging
to future opportunities after high school. So, the real question
for teachers is, how do we develop gritty students who can
Polirstok 3
approach tasks with growth mindsets? What strategies can
facilitate persistence, resilience, increased academic achieve-
ment, and foster a sense of self-efficacy that goes beyond the
limits of conformity?
Teaching Strategies That Can Help
Develop a Growth Mindset
Learning Stories
Simply telling a student that he or she is bright and can surely
learn what is being presented is not a successful strategy;
belief in oneself as a learner must come from within. One
strategy related to the development of self-efficacy involves
the use of "learning stories" that capture the narratives of stu-
dents who are empowered as learners and who yearn for
meaningful learning experiences (Pride, 2014). Learning sto-
ries typically include (a) a discussion of a problem or project,
(b) the learning challenges and the degree of difficulty the
problem/project presents, (c) the actions the student chose that
kept him or her engaged and working in the face of difficulty,
(d) the way success with this problem/project was assessed,
and (e) the extent to which the student was successful (Carr,
May, & Podmore, 1998). Creating these learning stories over
time, from students who are diverse by race, gender, ethnicity,
and academic background, can serve as an excellent resource
to help adolescents relate to others like themselves who have
been able to embrace a growth mindset. The digital learning
stories approach has been successfully employed at the
University of Texas at Austin for incoming freshman about to
enroll in rigorous science courses (Tough, 2014). In this arti-
cle, written by Paul Tough, a case example is provided that
involved minority students discussing how they felt when they
first entered these rigorous science courses, how they had little
confidence, and what strategies they used to help them be suc-
cessful in their studies. The stories that were most effective
either had a "belonging" message or a "mindset" message. In
the "belonging" message, students talked about their fears at
first of not fitting in, of not being smart enough to succeed, and
what things they did that made them feel more like they
belonged. In the stories that focused on "mindset," students
read and discussed an article that focused on how the brain
was changeable and, through practice, could foster increased
connections, challenging the conscious or unconscious belief
that intelligence is static. The outcome of this work at
University ofTexas atAustin, was that these messages worked;
more disadvantaged first-year freshmen students were retained
and completed more credits after viewing these digital stories
than did their comparison students.
What was unique here is the emphasis on developing self-
efficacy in freshmen by using digital learning stories told by
upper classmen who were representative of the same back-
grounds and neighborhoods where many of the incoming
freshmen lived. The connections that were made by the new
incoming freshmen to these "belonging" stories gave them
the courage to face the academic challenges presented by the
rigorous STEM (science, technology, engineering and math-
ematics) curriculum and to embrace a core belief, an implicit
theory, that they too could be successful. Relating to stories
from individuals of similar backgrounds helped to strengthen
a growth mindset in these new freshmen and fostered a sense
of belonging and perseverance that could be what Duckworth
et al. (2007) referred to as grit.
This article, written by Tough about the program at the
University ofTexas atAustin, connects with a book he authored
in 2012, titled How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity and the
Hidden Power of Character, and to a more recent book
authored in 2016, titled Helping Children Succeed: What Works
and Why? In both these texts, Tough argues that overcoming
the problems associated with growing up poor requires that stu-
dents learn the skills associated with character including grit,
curiosity, and an embrace of challenges that are linked with
opportunities. In essence, developing grit and mindset can lead
to success and increased opportunities; teachers need to create
classroom environments that provide children with chances to
see themselves differently as learners who can be successful.
Adolescent Literature
Like digital learning stories that contribute to students develop-
ing self-efficacy with respect to themselves as learners, charac-
ters from adolescent literature can effectively help students to
begin to challenge and change their mindsets from fixed to
growth and to begin to see themselves as resilient (Elish-Piper,
2014). According to Connors (2014), stories about adolescents
and young adults can become "a vehicle for imagining other
worlds . . . to inhabit other subject's positions and experiences,
circumstances and emotions other than their own" (p. 33). In
particular, the use of biographies can offer some insight into
"gritty" characters that struggle, persist, demonstrate resilience,
and ultimately succeed. "Salt in His Shoes: Michael Jordan in
Pursuit of a Dream (Jordan & Jordan, 2003) highlights the
challenges Michael Jordan faced and how he developed
patience, determination, and a commitment to hard work"
(Elish-Piper, 2014, p. 62). Biographies of individuals who have
overcome significant challenges may be very impactful for
young adolescents, especially if the highlighted individual is
someone who comes from a similar circumstance and back-
ground. Kaufman and Libby (2012) provide evidence that
beliefs and behaviors can be changed through an imaginative
"experience taking" process based on fictional narratives and
first-person stories. Similarly, Tough (2012) discusses the
"power of character" and both digital learning stories and biog-
raphies of individuals who have succeeded in the face of con-
siderable challenges are good illustrations of this concept.
The Choice Map
Embedded in the journeys that characters take in adoles-
cent literature are the "moment by moment" choices they
4 SAGE Open
make along the ongoing paths of the narrative. Adolescents
need to understand that these same kinds of choices are
made every day by themselves and others in their world,
and that these very choices can have profound effects on
the outcomes of their lives. Making choices and under-
standing the resultant outcomes of those choices is a big
part of helping students to "grow up." According to Marilee
Adams (2013), these choices emanate from either a
"learner mindset" or a "judger mindset," and can be
depicted graphically in the "Choice Map." In Adams' para-
digm, the "learner mindset" path is typically filled with
choices, whereas the "judger mindset" path is typically
filled with self-deprecating comments. Adams notes the
importance of the "switch" where a person can change his
or her path, or mindset, from judger to learner. The "Choice
Map" provides a graphic approach to following decisions
and feelings that students themselves, or people they know,
or characters they have read about, may experience. This
approach helps students to understand the consequences
that result from decisions, and the actions that can be taken
to "switch" from one path to another, from a mindset that
is limiting to another that provides many options.
Recognizing that one can overcome the judgmental, nega-
tive, and self-deprecating comments that often compete
with positive feelings and actions can be life altering! How
often do students with fixed mindsets experience the nega-
tive and self-deprecating thoughts that Adams' map depicts
and how can teachers help these students literally find the
switch to a growth (learner) mindset?
The Brainology Program
A software program geared for students in fifth grade to
ninth grade, developed by Mindset Works, Inc. (2017)
(https://www.mindsetworks.com/kid/programDescription) is
designed specifically to increase academic performance by
helping students to develop the self-efficacy or mindset nec-
essary for success. Underlying this self-efficacy or mindset
is a belief that intelligence can be developed in the same way
a muscle of the body can be developed through hard work
and practice. "Brainology makes this happen by teaching
students how the brain functions, learns and remembers, and
how it changes in a physical way when we exercise it"
(mindsetworks.com). This software program applies the
physical exercise metaphor to understanding specific skills
and strategies for addressing learning tasks and concepts. To
implement the program requires anywhere from 7 to 12 hr
and the training can be done over a 5- to 16-week period. The
program consists of an online training module that addresses
four instructional units and is followed by up to 10 hr of
classroom activities.
One research study (Saunders, 2014) was conducted to
assess the impact of Brainology on the reading performance
of low-achieving sixth graders on the cusp of failing.
Whereas this study did not find a treatment effect for changes
in the target behavior, focus group interviews did find that
students believed the Brainology program (n.d.) had affected
their understanding of intelligence.Another study by Wilkins
(2014) examined the impact of the Brainology program on
young adolescents and found no difference in academic or
self-efficacy measures, but noted improvement in the content
engagement and increased motivation. Clearly, more studies
need to be conducted to determine the efficacy of this pro-
gram on developing both grit and growth mindsets, but fos-
tering increased engagement, motivation, and a better
understanding of intelligence may be valuable in helping to
change a student's implicit theory about himself or herself as
a learner.
The 7 Mindsets: Ultimate Life Summit Program
This program developed by Shickler and Waller (2011),
based on their book titled The 7 Mindsets, provides direct
instruction in mindsets and highlights the importance of
grit and resilience for students in Grades 5 to 9 during a
7-day summer camp experience. The seven mindsets that
this program focuses on include "Everything is Possible,
Passion First, We Are Connected, 100% Accountable,
Attitude of Gratitude, Live to Give, and The Time is Now"
(Gamel, 2014, pp. 11-12). This program helps students rec-
ognize that success in the future begins within themselves,
in the big dreams they create that grow out of a passion or
a talent they possess. Moreover, the program teaches that
students are accountable for their actions and choices; they
are the makers of their own fates and create their own hap-
piness. Connectedness is another focus of this program;
students are asked to explore what they give and what they
get from relationships, how relationships are often untapped
resources, and the importance of making positive connec-
tions with, and contributions to, the community and the
larger world. Finally, the last mindset, "the Time is Now"
addresses seizing the moment to begin to make changes in
one's life that can enhance one's current path or lead to a
new path, giving life purpose and direction. In this last
mindset, taking action and possibly changing one's path,
not only with respect to school success but also more
broadly to success as a person in the world, help students
learn about empowerment.
Gamel (2014) employed this model as a means of study-
ing grit and resilience building in 45 predominantly older
adolescents drawn from an international sample of students.
As a consequence of training, the sampled students were bet-
ter able to understand resilience in themselves and had a bet-
ter appreciation of openness to possibilities, passions, and
accountability in the future. Students were asked to develop
a life plan for their future as part of the training. Having stu-
dents focus on how they might shape their own future
requires a growth mindset, goal setting, and lots of resilience
to plan how to address roadblocks and pitfalls that have the
potential to derail meeting their goals in the future.

Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches
There are several behavioral and cognitive approaches that
can be employed in the classroom that will contribute to the
development of a growth mindset for adolescents who lack
the resilience and the grit to persevere in completing tasks
that are getting progressively more challenging. These
approaches include peer tutoring, self-evaluation, and verbal
self-instruction. Even though all these approaches employ
contingent reinforcement, they do so in the context of learn-
ing to meet academic challenges, monitoring one's own per-
formance, and learning how to persist in the face of
self-defeating thoughts and behaviors. As Yeager and Dweck
(2012) point out, "we should not praise children for being
`smart' when they do well, but rather, to promote resilience,
praise them for the process they engaged in--their effort,
their strategies, their focus, or their persistence" (p. 311).
Peer tutoring. Peer tutoring is a well-documented technique
that has been used over 30 years to increase the academic
performance and sometimes the social/behavioral perfor-
mance of both tutors and tutees alike. Peer tutoring has been
implemented in various formats including reciprocal peer
tutoring, cross-age and cross-grade peer tutoring, and class-
wide peer tutoring.
Wexler, Reed, Pyle, Mitchell and Barton (2015) synthesized the
literature published between 2001 and 2012 related to peer-
mediated reading and math interventions for secondary
struggling learners and found that it was a moderately to highly
effective intervention for struggling learners at the secondary
level. (Alzahrani & Leko, 2017, p. 34)
"The success of peer tutoring for both tutors and tutees is
likely from incorporated instructional features such as fre-
quent opportunities to respond, increased time on-task, and
regular and immediate feedback" (Bowman-Perrott et al.,
2013, p. 39).
Students who have a fixed mindset and diminished confi-
dence in themselves as learners can be specifically selected
and trained to be tutors, to either work with younger students
who have weaker skill sets or to work with same-age peers,
and dispense verbal praise to tutees who are on-task and
making progress toward successful completion of assign-
ments. In other words, students do not have to tutor academic
skills; students can be trained to tutor on-task behaviors
rather than academic content. The act of serving as a tutor
can result in enhancement of one's social status with peers,
while garnering reinforcement from the teacher or teachers
who have established the tutoring program for their effec-
tiveness in dispensing praise to tutees for remaining on-task
to complete assignment requirements. By engaging in this
process, the tutors themselves learn the rules of persistence
to task completion and this learning can generalize to the
tutor's own performance in his or her academic classes
(Greer & Polirstok, 1982; Paterson & Elliott, 2006; Polirstok
& Greer, 1986; Sutherland & Synder, 2007). One of the fea-
tures of verbal praise is that it is reciprocal; the recipient of
the praise typically acknowledges its receipt, either by com-
menting verbally or by using head nods, smiles, and so forth.
As a consequence of dispensing verbal approval, the tutors
are likely to receive increased reinforcement from the tutees
via their verbal and nonverbal acknowledgments. Beyond
the increased social status that serving as a tutor may pro-
vide, the additional reinforcement and the act of tutoring
itself help the tutors to better understand persistence and the
positive outcomes that are derived from increased time on-
task. Taken together, increased social status and increased
time on-task can contribute to increased self-efficacy, and
over time, changes in mindset can emerge.
Self-evaluation. Self-evaluation training, sometimes referred
to as self-management or self-monitoring is one type of
metacognitive activity that can enhance both academic and
social performance (Ardoin & Martens, 2004). Self-evalua-
tion training for adolescents who typically do not persist in
meeting academic task demands teaches them to recognize
the criteria that will be used for evaluation in a given setting
and the perspective of the significant other(s) in the environ-
ment who will serve as raters of their performance (Polir-
stok, 1987, 1989). In self-evaluation, adolescents can be
taught by teachers to monitor specific academic or social
behaviors that detract from academic performance by pro-
viding the adolescent with feedback concerning the fre-
quency, accuracy, appropriateness, and completion of
assigned tasks and how they were rated by the teacher.
Amato-Zech, Hoff, and Doepke (2006) successfully
increased student on-task time by more than 50% using a
cueing procedure and reinforcers as part of a self-monitor-
ing program. Interventions using self-monitoring have been
widely reported as useful in strengthening proacademic and
prosocial behaviors. However, these interventions are not
typically generalized across settings and over time because
they are seen as situation specific. In contrast, self-monitor-
ing or self-evaluation procedures can be trained so that they
will generalize across settings and time by building in a
matching ratings procedure. When the adolescent has come
to understand the rating criteria, he or she then rates his or
her own performance independently and matches those rat-
ings to those collected simultaneously by the teacher. This
matching component is extremely valuable in helping the
adolescent to understand the teacher's perspective. Bonus
points or other reinforcers can be earned for the degree of
match between the adolescent and the teacher, thereby
increasing the motivation to evaluate one's own perfor-
mance by taking on the teacher's perspective. Over time,
once the degree of match between ratings is high, the ado-
lescent can then rate his or her own performance indepen-
dently and even self-reward as well, if the teacher has
empowered the student to self-determine reinforcers and
self-consequate when goals are met. What is potent about
6 SAGE Open
this intervention is that the adolescent learns to view his or
her behavior like the teacher, thinking in school settings
"How is the teacher viewing my behavior--the quality of
my assignment? My time on-task? My degree of compliance
with rules?" These questions and the process of determining
how the teacher views the adolescent's behavior becomes
what is portable about this intervention. As the adolescent
uses this procedure, it will facilitate generalization to other
classroom settings, vocational sites, or the home environ-
ment. Most recently, a new app for cell phones called "Score
It" provides an automatic cue for recording one or more
behaviors over a given observation period. This app also has
the ability to build in the matching component for the
teacher. The use of cell phone technology can enhance a stu-
dent's thinking about this self-evaluation process, making it
more "user friendly."
Self-evaluation can be a useful tool for adolescents who
lack the ability to persist through task completion and who
operate with a fixed mindset. By giving an adolescent a
structured approach that will help him or her stay on-task to
completion, he or she is likely to discover that increased
time on-task can improve the quality and accuracy of that
completed task. As a consequence, the adolescent learns
persistence and builds self-efficacy. Self-evaluation can
help the adolescent begin to think differently about himself
or herself as a learner, moving toward a more open or
growth mindset. "Beliefs of personal competence ulti-
mately become habits of thinking that serve [students]
throughout their lives" (Pajares, 2003, p. 153, as cited by
Margolis & McCabe, 2006, p. 226).
Verbal self-instruction. Another approach used by teachers to
help adolescents learn to manage their time on-task and/or
limit their own self-defeating thoughts around academic
performance is termed "verbal self-instruction," a form of
"self-talk" (Graybill, Jamison, & Swerdlik, 1984; Kunzen-
dorf, McGlone, & Hulihan, 2004). Margolis and McCabe
(2006) suggest that to increase self-efficacy in students, the
teacher needs to use verbal persuasion to convince them that
they are competent and can succeed if they employ a par-
ticular strategy. In other words, the goal is to determine ". . .
what to say to strengthen struggling learners' beliefs in their
academic abilities and how to increase their willingness to
engage in academic tasks" (p. 218). Teachers can provide
students with key phrases and/or questions that can be
trained through active rehearsal. The "self-talk" can serve to
diffuse self-defeating thoughts and or lessen the need for
task avoidance.
Adolescents can be trained to first recognize specific
self-defeating thoughts and the accompanying feelings
they experience. A series of questions that will help to
guide the students to make more appropriate choices about
the task at hand can be trained via rehearsal. For example,
given an assignment that the adolescent views as problem-
atic can prompt the following "self-talk" questions: "What
am I getting upset about?" "Maybe I need to read this
again?" "What don't I understand?" "What assignment is
this like that I recently completed successfully?" "Who
can I ask for help in a quiet way that won't call too much
attention to me?" Through this "self-talk" process, the
adolescent can better manage his or her feelings and
behaviors and identify resources in the environment that
can be helpful.
Adolescents need to learn "fix-up" strategies related to
academic performance; monitoring what one does not under-
stand and learning how to get the assistance one needs are
specific skills that can be taught. Learning how to recruit
assistance in the environment is a skill that can help adoles-
cents move from a learner who is not engaged, to a more
resilient learner willing to work through academic chal-
lenges. Self-evaluation and "self-talk" strategies are impor-
tant for adolescent learners to acquire because these strategies
have great potential for generalization and maintenance, fos-
tering increased academic performance in school, home, and
community settings.
A summary of the various strategies discussed to
strengthen grit and mindset can be found in Table 1.
Conclusion
Grit and mindset are important concepts for learners at any
age. However, for adolescents, being gritty and having a
growth mindset can significantly affect their futures. That
is why secondary school teachers need to be able to employ
some of the strategies discussed to help students improve
their performance and willingness to take on risks academ-
ically (for a complete listing of all the strategies presented
and how to access additional information, see Table 1).
Teachers need to help students focus on building persis-
tence and engaging in a process that leads to accomplish-
ing goals and fostering success. When students believe that
they can be successful as learners, and that their personal
narratives can be similar to those of older students who
have persevered, their trajectories with respect to postsec-
ondary school and career choices can be dramatically
changed!
This article has discussed a wide array of cognitive, tech-
nological, and behavioral strategies that teachers can imple-
ment to develop and strengthen the implicit theory students
have about themselves as learners. The strategies that teach-
ers select to use, be they learning stories, characters and situ-
ations from adolescent literature, choice maps, mindset
building programs, computer software programs, peer tutor-
ing, self-evaluation, or verbal self-instruction, are flexible,
capable of being customized, and often used in tandem to
address specific student needs. Understanding adolescent
development, the culture of secondary schools, and the strat-
egies that can develop grit and growth mindset are keys to
successfully teaching adolescents, especially those on the
cusp of failure.

Choice maps When confronting an academic challenge, a student can view his or
her actions through either a "learner mindset" or a "judger mindset."
Overcoming the "judger mindset," the negative voices one often
hears about his or her ability is key. How a learner changes paths to
a "learner mindset" where he or she can willingly take on learning
challenges and experience himself or herself differently is important

practice. Types of peer tutoring include reciprocal peer tutoring,
cross-age and cross-grade peer tutoring, and class-wide peer
tutoring. Research shows these techniques to be moderately to

Self-evaluation A metacognitive approach that requires students to evaluate their
own performance based on key criteria that can involve target
behaviors that are both academic and/or social in nature. A matching
procedure with the significant rater can also help students learn to
appreciate the perspective of the significant rater (parent, teacher,
or work supervisor), which can help to maintain proacademic and
prosocial behaviors over time
"Score-It" application for cell phones makes data collection for
students fairly simple, provides opportunities for matching ratings
with significant other

Polirstok (1987, 1989)
Margolis and McCabe (2006)
Verbal self-instruction Students can regulate their own academic and/or social behaviors
through a metacognitive "self-talk" process. The self-talk can be
scripted and practiced; fix-up strategies can be part of self-talk
