Introduction
Materialist and consumerist attitudes are becoming more
present in our lives because we are setting life goals, building
self-esteem, and forming beliefs about others. Thus, psychol-
ogists view these attitudes as an important topic within
research into human functioning. Despite the large amount
of research into materialism, the mechanism by which it is
engendered and the role of upbringing in its formation are
still unclear. It is expected that the family plays an important
role in the process because its impact is the strongest and is
present throughout a person's life. This claim seems to be
justified by previous research (Flouri, 1999, 2004; Górnik-
Durose & Dziedzic, 2013; Kasser, Ryan, Couchman, &
Sheldon, 2003; Kasser, Ryan, Zax & Sameroff, 1995).
However, as most of this research was conducted in Western
countries with developed consumer cultures, these questions
should also be studied in central and eastern Europe.
Although materialism is not a new concept in psychology,
it is certainly a complex and heterogeneous one requiring
further exploration and contextual research (Burroughs &
Rindfleisch, 2002; Kilbourne, Grünhagen, & Foley, 2005).
The concept also arouses controversy because it does not
allow for easy or full classification in terms of "good" and
"evil." A vast majority of researchers have remained critical
of materialism, defining it as a dark side variable (Burroughs
& Rindfleisch, 2002) and pointing to its strong negative rela-
tionship to happiness, a sense of well-being, and satisfaction
with life (Belk, 1985; Burroughs & Rindfleisch, 2002;
Richins & Dawson, 1992) as well as several other intra- and
inter-psychical variables (see Kasser, 2002). Some also point
to the positive aspects of materialism (Holt, 1997; Micken &
Roberts, 1999, as cited in Kilbourne et al., 2005) or its posi-
tive and negative aspects (Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-
Halton, 1981, as cited in Górnik-Durose, 2002). Thus,
positive or "instrumental" materialism sees possession as a
means of accomplishing aims and achieving non-material
goals inclusive of values aimed at self-fulfillment. However,
negative or "terminal" materialism makes possession a goal
in itself (Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).
Although materialism has been extensively researched,
no consensus has been reached concerning its definition.
Researchers argue whether materialism is a trait (Belk,
1985), attitude (Moschins & Churchill, 1978), value (Richins
& Dawson, 1992; Richins, 2004), or perhaps something alto-
gether different (Górnik-Durose, 2002). This study uses the
conceptualization proposed by Richins and Dawson (1992)
that predominates in contemporary psychology. Richins and
Dawson (1992) understand materialism as the "value which

Perceived Parental Upbringing and the
Materialism of Young Adults
Magdalena Poraj-Weder1
Abstract
The aim of the study was to determine whether the level and structure of young adults' materialism varied depending on
parental attitudes toward upbringing and whether a negative assessment of the family of origin's material situation and a low
level of meeting material needs in childhood contributed to the formation of materialistic attitudes. The sample comprised
453 individuals: 335 women (74%) and 118 men (26%). The results indicated that parental attitudes toward upbringing played
an important role in forming materialistic orientations in young people. Materialism is associated with parental attitudes of
rejection and over-protection. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the level and structure
of young adults' materialism varied depending on their parents' attitudes toward upbringing. The analysis revealed that
groups with different perceptions of these parental attitudes viewed them solely within the scope of variables describing
materialism as the importance of possessing and acquiring money to fulfill one's main goals in life (that being the case for all
its dimensions). The "traditional" understanding of materialism (and the most common one in specialist literature), that is,
regarding the possession of material goods as a source of happiness and an indicator of success in life, was non-differentiating.

guides human choices and behaviour in various situations
related to consumption and operationalize it as the set of
beliefs concerning the value attributed to material goods in
the individual's life" (p. 308). Materialism manifests itself in
three areas. The first area is the tendency to judge one's suc-
cess and that of others by the quantity and quality of posses-
sions (the role of possessions in defining success). The
second is the propensity to identify the possession of goods
with happiness and satisfaction (the role of acquisitions in
happiness). The third area is the central place in life accorded
to the acquisition of goods (acquisition centrality). Because
thinking about materialism solely in the context of material
goods seems to produce an incomplete picture of the phe-
nomenon, Richins and Dawson's conceptualization was
extended by adding another component, that is, the impor-
tance of money and its role in achieving one's main goals in
life.
Of course, questions related to the drive to acquire money
have already appeared in materialism research, especially in
studies on the relationships between materialism and a sense
of well-being (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996; Richins &
Dawson, 1992; Schmuck, Kasser, & Ryan, 2000). However,
as suggested by Srivastava, Locke, and Bartol (2001), stud-
ies explicitly or implicitly assumed that individuals who had
high financial aspirations and appreciated money would
wish to allot it toward making purchases and consumption.
Nevertheless, high financial aspirations and the tendency to
attach importance to money may also be based on other
"positive" motives, such as the need to secure one's own and/
or one's family's future or the need to be independent.
According to Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton (1981),
these motives are part of the "instrumental" form of material-
ism (as cited in Górnik-Durose, 2002) rather than "terminal"
motives, such as the willingness to enhance one's status or
the desire to gain admiration and/or arouse jealousy from
others.
Origins of Materialism
Many researchers have studied the essence and correlations
of materialism, but few have undertaken research into the
origin of the phenomenon. To date, the issue has mainly
been explored in countries with developed consumption
cultures that are suffering from the adverse consequences
of materialism due to its expansion. Studies into the deter-
minants of this materialistic orientation have been con-
ducted by many researchers (e.g., Cohen & Cohen, 1996;
Flouri, 1999, 2004; Kasser et al., 1995, 2003). The issue of
materialism has been present in Poland for less than 10
years (Górnik-Durose, 2002), but studies into the origin of
the phenomenon have only recently started to appear
(Górnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013). The studies quoted
above (Górnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013; Kasser et al.,
1995, 2003) explain the origin of materialism in the context
of a model designed by Kasser et al. (2003), which points to
two paths that lead to materialism: deprivation and social-
ization. The former presents materialism as a compensation
strategy (i.e., materialism as the effect of important psycho-
logical needs that were not satisfied in childhood). The lat-
ter emphasizes the role of internalizing and modeling
behaviors that lead to learning materialistic patterns (i.e.,
materialism as an effect of behavior modeling). The study
presented in this article considers the aspect of deprivation,
and the analysis focuses on the relationship between paren-
tal attitudes toward upbringing and young adults' material-
ism. It also considers two additional socioeconomic
variables: a subjective assessment of the family of origin's
material situation and the degree to which one's material
needs in childhood are met, which is subjectively
perceived.
The relationship between parental attitudes and children's
materialism has been studied by many researchers, including
Cohen and Cohen (1996), Flouri (2004), Kasser et al. (1995),
and Górnik-Durose and Dziedzic (2013) in Poland. Their
results indicate that a materialist orientation is engendered
by attitudes that do not involve a need for belonging and
closeness; these attitudes lack consistency and are associated
with excessive control. Such attitudes hinder the growth of
individual and social resources, disrupt the individuation
process (Plopa, 2005, 2008), and create an opening for defi-
cit compensation through the development of a materialist
orientation and thus a focus on goods and money (Kasser et
al., 1995). The concept of parental attitudes proposed by
Arrindell et al. (1999) was adopted in the present study.
Arrindell et al. distinguish three types of parental attitudes
exhibited by mothers and fathers: emotional warmth, over-
protection, and rejection. In view of the results cited above,
over-protection and rejection seem to foster a materialistic
orientation.
Research Issue
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships
between parental attitudes and materialism. Materialism is
understood here as the importance of possessing and acquir-
ing material goods and money to achieve one's main goals in
life. The following research questions were examined in this
study.
Research Question 1: Are maternal and paternal atti-
tudes toward a child's upbringing connected with young
people's materialism?
Based on existing literature and the results of previous
research, it was assumed that a materialistic orientation
would be fostered by parental rejection and over-protection
(Flouri, 1999, 2004; Górnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013;
Kasser et al., 1995). The relationships between young peo-
ple's materialistic orientations and mothers' parental atti-
tudes were expected to be stronger than relations between the
Poraj-Weder 3
former and parental attitudes exhibited by fathers (Górnik-
Durose & Dziedzic, 2013).
Research Question 2: Does young adults' materialism is
affected by parenting style and whether a young people's
needs were met in childhood?
To answer this question, it was necessary to divide the
entire group of participants into subgroups characterized by
the specific parenting styles exhibited by mothers and
fathers.
Method
Sample
The study surveyed individuals aged 18 to 34 years old. The
participants were full-time and evening students at the
University of Warsaw, the University of Social Sciences and
Humanities in Warsaw, the Academy of Special Education in
Warsaw, the University of Lód, the University of Computer
Sciences and Skills in Lód, the Academy of Music in Lód,
and the Lód University of Technology. In all, 530 individu-
als were surveyed, and 453 individuals were qualified for
analysis. The resulting participants comprised 335 females
(74%) and 118 males (26%).
Instruments
The study utilized a research strategy based on an adult's
retrospective assessment of childhood and growing up. The
questionnaire method was applied.
Maternal and paternal upbringing attitudes were exam-
ined using the Polish version of the My Memories of
Upbringing Egna Minnen Beträffande Uppfostran (s-EMBU )
inventory (Arrindell et al., 1999). The tool measures parental
upbringing attitudes on three dimensions: emotional warmth,
rejection, and over-protection. The reliability of the specific
dimensions in the presented study was as follows:
·
· emotional warmth: Cronbach's 
M
= .867; Cronbach's

F
= .915;
·
· rejection: Cronbach's 
M
= .786; Cronbach's 
F
=
.838; and
·
· over-protection: Cronbach's 
M
= .774; Cronbach's

F
= .778.
The subjective assessment of the family of origin's mate-
rial situation and the degree to which one's material needs
were met in childhood were determined using closed-ended
questions on a demographic questionnaire.
Materialism was studied using two scales: the Material
Values Scale (MVS) by Richins (2004) and the Motives for
Making Money Scale by Srivastava et al. (2001).
The MVS is the Polish adaptation of the abbreviated MVS
by Richins (2004). Richins' tool comprises 15 items forming
three subscales that address three aspects of materialism:
Success, Happiness, and Centrality of possessions. The suc-
cess subscale measures the tendency to assess one's own suc-
cess and the success of others based on the quantity and
quality of possessed goods. The Happiness subscale mea-
sures the tendency to equate possessions with a source of
happiness and satisfaction with life. The Centrality subscale
measures the centrality of possessions in an individual's life.
The MVS was adapted for Polish conditions by Wsowicz-
Kirylo (2013). Similar to the version devised by Richins, the
adapted version consists of 15 items and contains three sub-
scales: Success, Happiness, and Centrality of possessions.
However, the study presented here does not conform to the
three-factor structure, which is consistent with the results
from other Polish studies. Exploratory factor analysis was
conducted, and the results indicated four main components
with eigenvalues above one, which cumulatively accounted
for 54% of the variance. However, due to the unsatisfactory
reliability of the received subscales, factor analysis was per-
formed again by applying a solution suggested by the scree
plot for two and three components. Because of this proce-
dure, a proper version of the MVS was produced. This ver-
sion comprised 9 test items and contained two subscales:
Success and Happiness. The Success subscale included 5
items--the same as the original questionnaire version,
whereas the Happiness subscale was made up of 4 items,
which was also the same as Richins' scale. A subsequent
analysis performed on the 9-item questionnaire version
examined its internal structure. Exploratory factor analysis
was used using the principal components analysis method
with Oblimin rotation and Kaiser normalization. The results
for sample selection adequacy were satisfactory (Kaiser­
Meyer­Olkin [KMO] = 0.822; Bartlett's sphericity test 2 =
941.08, df = 36, p < .001; Bedyska & Cypryaska, 2007).
Two principal components were reached cumulatively and
accounted for 51.57% of the variance. The next step was to
determine the reliability of both subscales selected as a result
of factor analysis. To that end, Cronbach's alpha method was
applied. Item 14 comprising the Happiness subscale lowered
Cronbach's  coefficient value and weakly correlated with
the other items; therefore, it was dropped from the scale. In
this way, the final 8-item version of the tool was reached.
The Cronbach's  statistical values were .724 for the Success
subscale and .727 for the Happiness subscale. The psycho-
metric characteristics of the scale formed by combining
items included on both subscales were also tested. The
Cronbach's  coefficient value for these characteristics was
.783.
The Motives for Making Money Scale enables the diag-
nosis of materialism in relation to the importance of money
in value realization. In its original version, the tool comprises
10 subscales with three items each. The subscales are
Security, Family Support, Market Worth, Pride, Leisure,
Freedom, Impulse, Charity, Overcoming Self-Doubt, and
Social Comparison. The reliability of the specific subscales
measured by Cronbach's  coefficient ranges from .73 to .92
4 SAGE Open
(Srivastava et al., 2001). These subscales form three superior
dimensions, which were isolated by Srivastava et al. (2001)
as a result of second-order factor analysis. These dimensions
are positive motives, freedom of action, and negative
motives. Their reliability values are .86, .91, and .94,
respectively.
The scale was adapted for Polish conditions by Poraj-
Weder for the purposes of this work, and Srivastava et al.
(2001) gave consent for the tool to be adapted. The transla-
tion was done using the back-translation procedure and com-
petent raters. As in the original version, data concerning
motives for making money were subjected to second-order
factor analysis. The results received, however, were only
partly consistent with the original solution. Based on these
results, four dimensions were isolated instead of three, as in
the original version.
·
· The positive motives dimension grouped the security,
family, support, market worth, and pride scales. It
expressed the tendency to treat money as a means of
obtaining one's life necessities (e.g., "I want to secure
basic needs," "I want to secure the future of my chil-
dren"), a measure of market worth (e.g., "I want to get
just compensation for my efforts"), and a measure of
achievements in life (e.g., "I want to know that I can
handle challenges posed by life"). It proved to be
identical to the positive motives dimension isolated
by Srivastava et al. (2001).
·
· The freedom of action dimension grouped the leisure
and impulse scales. It expressed the tendency to treat
money as a means allowing for a comfortable, nice,
and entertaining life (e.g., "I want to let my mood
guide me at times so that I can blow money while
shopping just for the thrill of it," "I want to enjoy lux-
uries"). This dimension differed fundamentally from
the original freedom of action dimension (Srivastava
et al., 2001), which treated money as a means of car-
rying out values.
·
· The negative motives dimension grouped the over-
coming self-doubt and social comparison scales. It
was tantamount to perceiving money as a means of
overcoming one's deficiencies and gaining an advan-
tage over others (e.g., "I want to show that I am better
than my acquaintances, siblings, relatives," "I want
to prove that I am not as dumb as some people
assumed I was"). It proved identical to the negative
motives dimension isolated by Srivastava et al.
(2001).
·
· The charity scale comprised one scale of the same
name. It entailed treating money as a means of serving
others (e.g., "I want to donate money to those who
need it"). In the factor solution assumed by Srivastava
et al. (2001), charity did not form a separate factor;
instead, it was part of the freedom of action
component.
Research Results
The first aim of the study was to verify the relationship
between role models in the family and young people's mate-
rialism. The analyses indicated several interesting, though
relatively weak, relationships among the analyzed variables.
Relations Between Parental Attitudes and
Materialism (Understood as the Importance of
Possessing and Acquiring Material Goods for
Value Realization)
The first step was to analyze the relationship between mater-
nal and paternal attitudes toward upbringing and materialism
that equates the possession of goods with success and happi-
ness. Statistically significant relationships between paternal
attitudes toward children's upbringing for both success and
happiness were revealed. Both forms of materialism corre-
lated positively with attitudes of rejection and over-protec-
tion and negatively with an attitude of emotional warmth. In
relation to maternal attitudes toward upbringing, positive
relationships were found between treating possessions as a
measure of success and an attitude of over-protection and
between seeing possessions as a source of happiness and atti-
tudes of over-protection and rejection (p < .10). Detailed
results from the analyses are shown in Table 1.
Relations Between Parental Attitudes and
Materialism (Understood as the Importance
of Possessing and Acquiring Money for Value
Realization)
This study also aimed to analyze the relationship between
parental attitudes toward their children's upbringing and
materialism, understood in this section as the importance of
possessing money to realize values. In relation to maternal
attitudes toward upbringing, the attitude of acceptance (emo-
tional warmth) proved to be vital. It was positively correlated
with the positive motives dimension and with the freedom of
action and charity dimensions at the level of tendency, thus
indicating good or "instrumental" materialism
(Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton, 1981, as cited in
Górnik-Durose, 2002). An attitude of over-protection was
positively correlated with the negative motives dimension,
which equates money with the ability to overcome one's
deficiencies and gain an advantage over others; therefore,
bad ("terminal") materialism was indicated. The attitude of
rejection also correlated with the negative motives dimen-
sion at the level of tendency.
A very similar set of results was received for the fathers.
The attitude of acceptance correlated positively with the pos-
itive motives and charity dimensions, while the attitude of
rejection correlated negatively with the positive motives
dimension and positively with the negative motives
Poraj-Weder 5
dimension. The attitude of over-protection correlated posi-
tively with the negative motives dimension (Table 2).
To answer the second question, it was first necessary to
isolate and describe groups comprising mothers and fathers
who exhibited specific types of parental attitudes and then to
determine whether those groups showed differences in the
level and structure of materialism.
Parenting styles. Ward's (1963) method of hierarchical clus-
tering analysis was used (StatSoft, Electronic Statistic Text-
book) to assign individuals to groups according to parenting
styles. Ward's method was chosen to minimize variance
within clusters and to group participants exhibiting similar
parenting styles. The analysis was based on empirical data
describing parenting styles exhibited by mothers and fathers.
The analysis was conducted for three, four, and five clus-
ters. An optimal value was received for four clusters
comprising 163, 181, 74, and 38 individuals. Differences
between each group's parental attitudes toward upbringing
are shown in Table 3 and are illustrated in Figure 1.
The isolated groups are represented by (1) individuals
who perceived their mother's and father's parenting styles as
normal; (2) individuals with a positive perception of their
mothers and who perceived their fathers as isolating; (3)
individuals who perceived their mothers as distant and con-
trolling and their fathers as inconsistent; and (4) individuals
who perceived their mothers as over-protective and their
fathers as rejecting and controlling.
Individuals who perceived their mother's and father's
parenting styles as normal (Cluster 1) differed from the oth-
ers on all the dimensions of parental attitudes toward
upbringing. The only exception was for the attitude of rejec-
tion exhibited by the mother (similarly "remembered" in the
first and second clusters). Thus, individuals in the first group

had the lowest scores regarding the father's attitude of rejec-
tion in comparison with the other clusters (p = .001).
Moreover, they received the most emotional warmth from
both parents. They scored moderately on the over-protection
attitude, which indicates its normal intensity (parents are per-
ceived as protective but not controlling).
Individuals with a positive perception of their mothers
and who perceived their fathers as isolating (Cluster 2) were
characterized by a complex array of scores. Hence, they dif-
fered in regard to maternal parenting styles from the third
cluster (p = .001) and the fourth cluster (p = .001) on the
rejection dimension, from the first and second clusters on the
emotional warmth dimension, and from all the clusters on
the over-protection dimension (p = .001), in which they
scored the lowest in comparison with the other groups. The
array of scores for maternal attitudes toward upbringing indi-
cates a similarity between the parenting style in the second
cluster and the style characterizing the first cluster, that is,
individuals who perceived the parenting style of both parents
as normal. However, in the second cluster, the profile is
clearly less beneficial; mothers are perceived as less emo-
tionally warm and less protective. Consequently, this cluster
specifies these maternal parenting styles as "positive" but
not "normal" or "desirable."
When analyzing paternal parenting styles, participants in
the second cluster differed from the others on the rejection
(p = .001) and over-protection (p = .001) dimensions. In
terms of the attitude of rejection, they scored higher than the
individuals in the first cluster did and lower than the indi-
viduals in the third and fourth clusters did, while they scored
the lowest compared with the other clusters on the over-pro-
tection dimension. In addition, the participants differed from
individuals in the first cluster in the emotional warmth
dimension. Therefore, in comparison with the other clusters,
fathers in this cluster seem emotionally cool, uninterested in
their children, and "absent" in the upbringing process.
Individuals who perceived their mothers as distant and
controlling and their fathers as inconsistent (Cluster 3) dif-
fered from the others on all the dimensions of maternal atti-
tudes toward upbringing. They received the highest scores
on the rejection (p = .001) and over-protection (p = .001)
dimensions and the lowest scores on the emotional warmth
(p = .001) dimensions compared with the other clusters. Such
an array of scores makes this maternal parenting style the
least beneficial compared with the other clusters.
In terms of paternal parenting styles, participants in the
second cluster differed from the others on the rejection (p =
.001) and over-protection (p = .001) dimensions. Regarding
the attitude of rejection, the participants scored higher than
the individuals in the first and second clusters and lower than
the individuals in the fourth cluster. For the attitude of over-
protection, they scored higher than individuals in the second
cluster and lower than individuals in the first and fourth clus-
ters. This structure indicates an inconsistency in upbringing,
as fathers seem simultaneously rejecting, protective, and
emotionally cool. Together with emotionally cool, rejecting,
and controlling mothers, they create a clearly adverse envi-
ronment for the process of individuation.

Individuals who perceived their mothers as over-protec-
tive and their fathers as rejecting and controlling (Cluster 4)
differed from the other clusters for maternal parenting styles
on the rejection (p = .001) and over-protection (p =.001)
dimensions and from clusters 1 (p = .001) and 3 (p = .001) on
the emotional warmth dimension. Thus, for the attitude of
rejection and over-protection, they scored higher than indi-
viduals in the first and second clusters and lower than indi-
viduals in the third cluster, whereas they scored lower than
individuals in the first cluster and higher than individuals in
the third cluster for the attitude of emotional warmth. The
scores on the over-protection and emotional warmth dimen-
sions are especially significant to the qualitative description
of this cluster. Their intensity indicates a clear perception of
mothers as over-protective (although not controlling).
In terms of paternal parenting styles, the participants in
this cluster scored the highest on the rejection (p = .001) and
over-protection (p = .001) dimensions in comparison with
the other clusters. Moreover, they differed from the first clus-
ter (p = .001) on the emotional warmth (p = .001) dimension,
where they received lower scores. Such an array of scores
indicates a strongly negative perception of paternal parenting
styles. Fathers are perceived as exceptionally strict, reject-
ing, controlling, and emotionally cool.
The clusters that emerged from the analysis were further
characterized by socioeconomic variables. Participants
assigned to a given group were tested for the subjective
assessment of their financial situation and the satisfaction of
their needs during childhood. To that end, a different signifi-
cance test was performed between two independent propor-
tions (Ferguson & Takane, 2009). The results of this analysis
are shown in Table 4.
Statistically significant differences were found for the
first and second clusters (p = .05) and for the first and fourth
ones (p = .05). The percentage of individuals who perceived
the material conditions in which they grew up as negative
was higher in the second and fourth clusters than in the first
cluster.
The last element of the deprivation path in the presented
study was then tested, that is, the degree to which one's
material needs were met during childhood. Similar to the
subjective assessment of material conditions, a different sig-
nificance test was performed between two independent pro-
portions (Ferguson & Takane, 2009). The percentage of
individuals who assessed the degree to which their material
needs were met during childhood as unsatisfactory was lower
in the first cluster than in all the others (p = .05). Moreover,
the percentage of individuals who stated that their parents
went above and beyond in meeting their material needs was
higher in the first cluster than in the fourth cluster No other
differences regarding satisfaction were observed among the
clusters.
Differences Between Clusters With Respect to
the Level and Structure of Materialism
The objective of the next stage of analysis was to answer the
second research question, namely, whether different parent-
ing styles result in varying intensities and structures of mate-
rialism in young adults. To answer that question, a MANOVA
between groups was conducted. The groups determined in
the hierarchical cluster analysis were treated as the indepen-
dent variable. Two dependent variables were used:
·
· materialism understood as the importance of possess-
ing and acquiring material goods to achieve one's
main goals in life, which are defined as success and
happiness; and
·
· materialism understood as the importance of possess-
ing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals
in life, which are defined as positive motivation, free-
dom of action, negative motivation, and charity.
The results indicated that participants differed only on
variables describing materialism as the importance of pos-
sessing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals in
life. In addition, inter-group differences in materialism
understood in this way were found for all four of its dimen-
sions: positive motives, F(3, 452) = 2.758, p = .042, 2 =
.018; freedom of action, F(3, 452) = 2.871, p = .036, 2 =

.018; and charity, F(3, 452) = 2.914, p = .034, 2 = .019.
Although the results were statistically significant in each
case, their strength measured with the 
p
2 coefficient was
weak. "Traditionally" captured materialism, which regards
the possession of material goods as a source of happiness and
an indicator of success in life, was found to be non-differen-
tiating (Table 5).
To check whether the structure and intensity of specific
components of materialism in a cluster differed from the
structure and intensity of materialism in other clusters, a
series of unpaired t tests was performed. For these tests, the
first, second, and third clusters constituted the first group and
the second group included "classified" participants, exclud-
ing those individuals in a cluster that constituted the first
group for comparisons. The results of these analyses are pro-
vided in Tables A1 to A4 in the appendix.
Individuals who perceived the parental styles of both their
parents as normal (Cluster 1) scored higher in comparison with
the other clusters on the positive motives dimension, t(377.44) =
2.512, p = .010, and at the level of tendency on the freedom of
action, t(454) = 1.735, p = .083, and charity, t(454) = 1.800, p =
.072, dimensions. Individuals in the second cluster differed from
those in the other clusters on the same dimensions--significantly
on positive motives, t(454) = -2.657, p = .008, and at the level of
tendency on charity, t(454) = -1.769, p = .078--but the differ-
ences were in the opposite direction. Individuals who perceived
their mothers as distant and controlling and their fathers as incon-
sistent (Cluster 3) differed from those in the other clusters on the
freedom of action, t(91.95) = -2.364, p = .020, dimension in that
they received significantly lower scores. Finally, individuals who
perceived their mothers as over-protective and their fathers as
rejecting and controlling (Cluster 4) scored higher in comparison
with the other clusters on the negative motives, t(454) = 2.746,
p = .006, dimension and lower (at the level of tendency) on the
charity, t(454) = -1.839, p = .067, dimension.
Discussion
The results of these analyses indicated that parental attitudes
toward upbringing play an important role in forming young
people's materialistic orientation.
The hypothesis regarding the positive relationship
between young people's materialism and parental attitudes
of rejection and over-protection was confirmed. The conclu-
sion applies both to materialism understood as the impor-
tance of possessing and acquiring material goods for value
realization and to materialism understood as the importance
of possessing and acquiring money for value realization. The
attitude of over-protection seems to be especially adverse. It
clearly contributes to the belief that possessed goods are a
guarantee of happiness and success and that money serves to
overcome doubts and to gain an advantage over others ("ter-
minal" materialism). In turn, attitudes toward upbringing
that support the individuation process, which is associated
with emotional warmth, contribute to forming positive
motives for earning money and treating it as a means to ful-
filling constructive goals and values ("instrumental" materi-
alism). In addition, fathers' attitudes toward upbringing are
negatively related to materialism in terms of viewing posses-
sions as a measure of success and a source of happiness.
It is quite surprising and contrary to previously held
assumptions that paternal (rather than maternal) attitudes
toward children's upbringings appeared to be more impor-
tant in forming young people's materialistic orientations.
Relationships between materialism (understood as the
importance of possessing and acquiring both material goods
and money for value realization) and the attitude of rejection
exhibited by mothers were observed only at the level of ten-
dency (the attitude of over-protection played a significant
role). This result requires further verification because accord-
ing to information provided by the specialist literature,
abnormal maternal attitudes are central to forming young
people's materialistic orientations (Flouri, 1999, 2004;
Górnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013; Kasser et al., 1995).
However, studies by Kasser et al. (1995) and Flouri
(1999) only examined mothers. Therefore, the hypothesis
regarding the impact of paternal attitudes toward children's
upbringings on young people's materialism was de facto not
verified. However, studies by Górnik-Durose and Dziedzic
(2013) used a retrospective assessment of parental attitudes
to analyze differences between groups that were isolated
based on a configuration of goals in life (individuals with
materialistic orientations were compared with individuals

oriented toward spiritual development and individuals ori-
ented toward achieving psychophysical harmony). These
studies produced results indicating inter-group differentia-
tion between both maternal and paternal attitudes toward
upbringing. In both these cases, inconsistent and demanding
attitudes proved to be important. Although the strength of the
effect was decidedly higher for maternal attitudes toward
upbringing, the results indicated that not only maternal but
also paternal attitudes toward children's upbringing play a
role in forming young people's orientation in life. This result
was also confirmed in a study conducted by Poraj-Weder and
Dzierek (2012) that compared differences between life
goals among groups that were isolated based on the quality
of parental attitudes toward children's upbringing. The object
of the analyses was to determine which maternal and pater-
nal attitudes toward upbringing are differentiating in relation
to forming materialistic orientations operationalized by
attaching a high importance to goals related to money, image,
and fame. The results revealed that individuals who per-
ceived parental attitudes toward upbringing as normal
assessed goals indicating materialistic orientations signifi-
cantly lower than did individuals who perceived maternal
attitudes toward upbringing as inadequate (inconsistent,
over-protective) or those who perceived paternal attitudes as
inadequate (rejecting, excessively demanding, do not sup-
port autonomy).
The other aim of the study was to determine whether the
level and structure of young adults' materialism varied
depending on how they perceived their parents' style of par-
enting. The cluster analysis used in the study divided the par-
ticipants into four groups based on their perception of
maternal and paternal parenting styles. The four clusters
were divided as follows: (1) individuals who perceived their
mother's and father's parenting styles as normal; (2) indi-
viduals with a positive perception of their mothers and who
perceived their fathers as isolating; (3) individuals who per-
ceived their mothers as distant and controlling and their
fathers as inconsistent; and (4) individuals who perceived
their mothers as over-protective and their fathers as rejecting
and controlling.
The groups differed in their subjective assessment of the
material situation and subjectively perceived the degree to
which their material needs were met during childhood. The
first cluster contained the highest the percentage of "satis-
fied" individuals in comparison with the other clusters. In
contrast, the fourth cluster comprised the largest number of
individuals who experienced deficiencies in both areas.
A comparative analysis of the each groups regarding spe-
cific components of materialism (understood as the impor-
tance of possessing and acquiring material goods and money
to achieve one's main goals in life) revealed interesting
results.
First, the studied groups differed only on the scope of
variables describing materialism as the importance of pos-
sessing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals in
life (this was the case for all its dimensions). Materialism in
its "traditional" and most common understanding, that is, the
possession of material goods as a source of happiness and an
indicator of success in life, was non-differentiating. This was
a surprising result that requires further empirical verification
because it indicates a higher importance for the component
that associates materialism with gathering money (rather
than with gathering goods) and, more specifically, with vari-
ous motivations that underlie gathering money.
In terms of the motives for gathering money, the relation-
ships revealed were as expected. Positive parenting styles on
the part of both parents (Cluster 1) or only mothers (Cluster
2) created favorable conditions for shaping positive motives
for gathering money, which are typical of "instrumental"
materialism. However, negative parental attitudes toward
upbringing, especially on the part of fathers (Cluster 4),
resulted in the development of negative compensatory
motives, which represent "terminal" materialism.
Thus, the hypothesis that the deprivation path leads to
materialism was confirmed for parental attitudes toward
children's upbringings.
In terms of the formulated expectations, an apparently
contradictory result was received for the third cluster.
Negative maternal attitudes toward upbringing associated
with excessive control and emotional distance combined
with inconsistency in paternal upbringing (Cluster 3) resulted
in the inhibited development of motives connected with the
freedom of action dimension, which leads to the tendency to
treat money as a means of obtaining a comfortable, nice, and
entertaining life. Cluster three's high reluctance to freely and
"materialistically" dispose of their money may result from a
need for security that was not satisfied in their childhood
because of disturbed relationships with their mothers
(Uchnast, 1991). This deficit may trigger behaviors aimed at
ensuring security for oneself, which is manifested in various
areas of life, including one's attitude toward money and a
reluctance to squander it and spend it to indulge oneself.
The issue is very interesting in the context of the depriva-
tion-related roots of materialism. However, it requires fur-
ther research and empirical verification through analysis
carried out on a representative sample using instruments that
are more sophisticated. The sample and the measures used in
this study both somewhat limit the results of this research.
In interpreting the results of the study, one should note the
structure of the sample; 74% of the participants were women.
It is possible that this disparity biased the results. The study
should be repeated with a representative sample of an appro-
priate size.
The instruments used in the study have good psychometric
properties, although they do rely on self-assessment. While
such tools are widely accepted in studies on parental attitudes
and materialism, they are sensitive to situational and temporal
factors. Therefore, alternative assessments on parental attitudes
toward children's upbringings and materialism that corroborate
or extend the results of this research would be desirable.
In conclusion, the results of the present study show that
parents can effectively help their children live lives governed
10 SAGE Open
by "being" rather than "having" by ensuring well-function-
ing family environments for them. This result is very impor-
tant. The ubiquitous mercantilism in social relations and the
belief that possessions define our identities pose a serious
threat to the proper development of the young generation and
provide fertile grounds for the growth of materialism as a
character trait. The role of the family is particularly impor-
tant in this context. A child's materialist orientation is shaped
and strengthened within the family. When they are accepted
and loved, children grow in an atmosphere conducive to the
development of self-esteem and the adoption of a system of
values that helps them resist harmful external influences and
make free choices. However, deficits in this area lead them
to seek compensation in the form of goods and money,
although such a lifestyle does not guarantee a sense of
well-being.
