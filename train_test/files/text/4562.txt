Introduction
A number of clinical1­4 and experimental5­9 studies have
demonstrated that renin­angiotensin system (RAS)
inhibitors, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor and an angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor
(AT1R) blocker (ARB) reduce renal tissue damage and
proteinuria. These reports indicated that Ang II is
involved in the development of kidney diseases and pro-
teinuria. Although the action of Ang II is basically
explained as being on systemic blood pressure and/or
intra-glomerular pressure-dependent mechanisms, some
studies have focused on the pressure-independent mech-
anism of Ang II action in kidney.10,11 Although the RAS
was originally viewed solely as an endocrine system,
some recent studies have emphasized that the local RAS
plays an essential role in maintaining local tissue func-
tions.12,13 However, the role of the local RAS in regulat-
ing glomerular function is not yet well evaluated.
In the field of nephrology, clarification of the mecha-
nism of proteinuria is one of the most important themes.
The filtration barrier of the kidney glomerulus, preventing
the leak of plasma proteins into primary urine, comprises
three layers: the endothelial cells, the glomerular basement
membrane, and the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). It

Abstract
Background and objective: Renin­angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors reduce glomerular injury and proteinuria,
indicating that angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in glomerular diseases. Although the local RAS is reported to play an
essential role in maintaining local tissue functions, the role of the local RAS in regulating glomerular function is not well
evaluated. In this study, we analyzed the glomerular expression of RAS components in nephrotic models and the effect
of Ang II receptor blockers (ARB) on the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT).
Methods: The levels of glomerular expression of RAS components were analyzed in two nephrotic models: anti-nephrin
antibody-induced nephropathy and PAN nephropathy, a mimic of human minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The effect
of the ARB irbesartan on the expression of AGT in the nephrotic model was analyzed.
Results: Glomerular expression of AGT and the receptors for Ang II was clearly increased in the nephrotic models, while
the expression levels of renin, ACE and ACE2 were decreased. ARB treatment suppressed the increase of glomerular
expression of AGT in the nephrotic model.
Conclusion: It is conceivable that the promoted local RAS action participated in the glomerular dysfunction, and that ARB
treatment ameliorated slit diaphragm injury by inhibiting the positive feedback loop of the activated local Ang II action.

is now accepted that the slit diaphragm (SD), located
between adjacent foot processes of podocytes, functions as
the final barrier of the glomerular capillary wall, and that
dysfunction of the SD is involved in the development of
proteinuria in several common diseases .14­16
We have previously reported that the ARB ameliorates
proteinuria in rat nephropathy models in which proteinuria
results from SD dysfunction.17,18 In these reports, we
showed that ARB reduced proteinuria by preventing the
dis-localization of the functional molecules of the SD.
These observations indicated that the increase in Ang II
action participates in the development of SD dysfunction.
However, the differential roles of the systemic and local
RAS in regulating the barrier function of the SD remain to
be clarified.
In this study, we showed that glomerular expression of
angiotensinogen (AGT) and the receptors for Ang II were
clearly increased in the nephrotic models. We also showed
that ARB treatment rescued the decreased expression of
nephrin, a key molecule of the SD, and suppressed the
increase of the expression of AGT in nephrotic rat glomer-
uli. It is conceivable that the promoted local RAS action
participated in SD dysfunction, and that ARB treatment
ameliorated SD injury by blocking the positive feedback
loop of the activated local Ang II action.
Materials and methods
Animals and cultured podocytes
All in vivo experiments were performed using specific path-
ogen-free female Wistar rats weighing 100­110 g at the age
of 7­8 weeks. All rats used in this study were purchased
from Charles River Japan (Atsugi, Japan), and fed with a
normal salt diet. All animal experiments conformed to the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Procedures for the present study were
approved by the Animal Committee according to the guide-
lines for animal experimentation of Niigata University. All
the animal experiments were conducted in compliance with
the protocol which was reviewed by the InstitutionalAnimal
Care and Use Committee and approved by the President of
Niigata University (Permit Number: #26, Niigata Univ.
Res.378-2). Cultivation of conditionally immortalized
mouse podocytes kindly donated by Dr. P. Mundel (Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) was conducted
as reported previously.19
Experimental protocols
Experiment 1: Analyses of the expression of
RAS components in nephrotic syndrome models
ANA nephropathy. Two sets of experiments were done. In
each set nine rats were used. Six rats were intravenously
injected with murine monoclonal antibody against rat
nephrin (ANA: mAb 5-1-6),20,21 and three rats each were
killed under pentobarbital anesthesia at 1 h and 5 days
after the injection. Another three rats were injected with
vehicle (PBS) and sacrificed at 1 h. After blood sampling,
the kidneys were removed, weighed, cut into portions and
used in immunofluorescence (IF) studies. The remaining
kidney materials from three rats in each group were pooled
and used for preparation of glomeruli, and the glomerular
materials were used for reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for Western blot analysis.
PAN nephropathy.The same as for the study on ANA
nephropathy, two sets of experiments were performed for
PAN nephropathy. In each set nine rats were used. Six
rats were intravenously injected with PAN (100 mg/kg
b.w.), and three rats each were killed under pentobarbital
anesthesia at 1 h and 10 days after the injection. Another
three rats were injected with vehicle (PBS) and sacrificed
at 1 h. The samples were prepared as in the ANA nephrop-
athy experiment.
Experiment 2: Analysis of the effect of ARB on
the expression of AGT and nephrin
A total of 12 rats were injected with PAN, and six rats were
orally administered with irbesartan (15 mg/kg b.w. per
day) from 3 days before the injection with PAN, and the
remaining six rats were treated with distilled water.
Irbesartan was kindly gifted from Dainippon Sumitomo
Pharma Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan. The treatment of 15 mg/kg
b.w. per day of irbesartan was confirmed not to affect sys-
temic blood pressure18 and to ameliorate proteinuria (day
8: 237.6 ± 97.0 vs. 359.0 ± 63.3 mg/day, p < 0.05). All rats
were sacrificed on day 10. Kidney materials were used for
RT-PCR and IF analyses. The other three rats injected with
PBS instead of PAN were treated with ARB as described
above and sacrificed 10 days after PBS injection.
RT-PCR
Real-time RT-PCR analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR
with glomerular RNA was performed according to the
method described previously.17,18 The data are shown as
ratios relative to control findings and expressed as means
± SD of two samples. The primer sequences are summa-
rized in Table 1.
Immunofluorescence
IF studies were performed according to the method previ-
ously reported.21 Antibodies used in this study are as fol-
lows: rabbit anti-AGT antibody was purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), and mouse anti-nephrin
antibody (ANA: mAb 5-1-6) was prepared as previously
described.20,21 The following antibodies were used as the
Yamazaki et al. 3
markers for glomerular cells: mouse anti-RECA1 antibody
(Serotec, Oxford, JE, UK), mouse anti-synaptopodin anti-
body (PROGEN, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse anti-
Thy1.1 (OX7).22 FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG,
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and RITC-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG were purchased from DakoCytomation
(Glostrup, Denmark).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed according to the
method described previously.23 Strips of the membrane
were exposed to rabbit anti-AGT antibody or rabbit anti--
actin antibody. Anti--actin antibody was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA). The
strips were then washed and incubated with alkaline phos-
phatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Zymed
Laboratory Inc. San Francisco, CA, USA).
Results
mRNA expression of RAS components was
detected in glomeruli and cultured podocytes
mRNA expression of AGT, renin, ACE, ACE2, neprilysin,
AT1R and AT2R was detected in isolated rat glomeruli and
in differentiated cultured podocytes by RT-PCR. The find-
ings are shown in Figure 1.
Glomerular mRNA expression of RAS
components was altered in nephrotic rats
Glomerular mRNA expression of AGT was clearly
increased more than 50 times in both nephrotic models.
The expression levels were already increased just
after disease induction (1 h) in both models. The expres-
sion levels of Ang II receptors were also increased. The
expression of AT1R was clearly doubled when proteinuria
peaked in both models, although the increase was not evi-
dent at the early phase (1 h). Expression ofAT2R increased
by around 10 times at 1 h after disease induction in both
models. On the other hand, expression levels of the
enzymes RAS, renin, ACE, ACE1 and neprilysin were
decreased. The features of the changes in expression of
RAS components were very similar in the two models. The
findings are shown in Figure 2.
Glomerular expression of AGT was increased at
the protein level in nephrotic models
Bands around 50 kd were detected in normal rat glomeru-
lar lysate with anti-AGT antibody, and the intensity of the
bands was increased in the glomerular lysates of rats in
the nephrotic models. Representative Western blot find-
ings and semi-quantitative data are shown in Figure 3(a).
The immunostaining of AGT was observed in a discon-
tinuous patchy pattern in normal rat glomeruli; the inten-
sity of the AGT staining increased and its staining pattern
changed to a continuous pattern along the capillary loop
in the nephrotic models (Figure 3(b)). Dual-labeling IF
analysis showed that the AGT staining on day 10 of PAN
nephropathy was clearly different from endothelial cell
marker RECA-1 and mesangial cell marker Thy1, and
major portions of AGT were co-stained with a podocyte
marker synaptopodin (Figure 3(c)). Positive AGT stain-
ing was detected at the apical surface of tubular cells in
proteinuric states (Figure 3(b)). Positive AGT staining
was observed in normal rat liver section. No clear
increase in AGT staining was detected in the nephrotic
models used in this study (data not shown).

ARB treatment suppressed the increased AGT
expression in PAN nephropathy
In experiment 1, we showed that AGT was clearly upregu-
lated, and renin, ACE and nephrin were downregulated in
nephrotic glomeruli. Next, we analyzed the effect of ARB
treatment on the expression of RAS components and nephrin.
The increase of mRNAexpression ofAGT and the reduction
of renin, ACE and nephrin at 1 h of PAN nephropathy were
suppressed by theARB treatment (Figure 4(a)). The increase
in the immunostaining of AGT on day 10 of PAN nephropa-
thy was suppressed by ARB treatment (Figure 4(b)).
Discussion
It is understood that Ang II contracts efferent arterioles of
glomeruli more effectively than afferent arterioles, and
that the consequent glomerular hypertension damages the
glomeruli and enhances proteinuria. Thus, it has been
accepted that RAS inhibitors have a protective role for kid-
ney glomeruli and ameliorate proteinuria by reducing glo-
merular hypertension. However, some recent reports have
shown that RAS inhibitors reduce proteinuria indepen-
dently to intra-glomerular pressure.10,11 It is also reported
that Ang II acts directly on glomerular podocytes.17,24
From these observations, it is now accepted that the action
of Ang II directly damages the barrier function of podo-
cytes, and RAS inhibitors ameliorate proteinuria by pro-
tecting podocytes. However, the pathogenic mechanism of
how Ang II acts on podocytes is still unclear. Durvasula
et al. showed that cultured podocytes actively synthesize
AGT if they are stimulated by stretch or a high-glucose
condition.25,26 The reports suggested that the local RAS
participates in the development of podocyte injury. On the
other hand, Matsusaka et al. reported that Ang II action-
dependent nephropathy could be induced in podocyte-
specific AGT knockout mice, indicating that the systemic
RAS plays a major role in inducing podocyte damage.27
Thus the role of the local RAS in podocyte injury is still
controversial.
In this study we first analyzed the expression of RAS
components in isolated glomeruli and in cultured podo-
cytes. mRNA expression of all major components of the
RAS was detected (Figure 1). Expression of AGT in nor-
mal rat glomeruli was also observed with immunohisto-
chemical analysis, although the staining was not very
intense. It is conceivable that these observations suggest
that the local RAS might have a physiological role in
maintaining glomerular function.
Next, to elucidate the role of the local RAS in the devel-
opment of podocyte injury, we analyzed the expression of
RAS components in nephrotic models. We adopted two
nephrotic models, ANA nephropathy and PAN nephropa-
thy. ANA nephropathy is caused by a one-shot injection of
the antibody against nephrin, a key molecule of the SD.
Proteinuria in ANA nephropathy is induced by the rear-
rangement of nephrin and other functional molecules of
the SD without participation of any inflammatory factors
or complement.21,23,28,29 PAN nephropathy is widely used
as an experimental model of human minimal change
nephrotic syndrome. PAN has toxicity specifically to
podocytes. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism of
PAN nephropathy has not yet been elucidated, it is accepted
that the disarrangement of the SD molecules is involved in
the development of proteinuria in this nephropathy.21,23,30
We found that glomerular mRNA expression of AGT is
dramatically increased in both models from just after dis-
ease induction, and that the increase of AGT expression
was maintained when proteinuria peaked (Figure 2). The
increased expression of AGT in glomeruli was also
detected in the immunohistochemical analysis and Western
blot study with glomerular lysates (Figure 3(a, b)).

Glomerular mRNA expression of AGT is evidently increased in both models. Expression levels of AT1R and AT2R were increased. Expression of re-
nin, ACE, ACE1 and neprilysin was decreased. The data are shown as ratios relative to control findings and expressed as means ± SD of two samples.
6 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
Dual-labeling IF study with glomerular cell markers
showed AGT was mainly expressed in podocytes in glo-
meruli (Figure 3(c)).
In this study we also showed that the mRNA expression
of AT1R was clearly increased in the nephrotic stage in
both models. By contrast, the expression of renin and ACE
was decreased (Figure 2). These enzymes might be
decreased to suppress the effect of the dramatic increase of
AGT production. Although the meaning of the changes in
the expression of the RAS molecules in glomeruli is not
well explained, these observations suggest that local RAS
activity is basically regulated by the amount of the
substrate, AGT, and that the increased production of AGT
in podocytes contributes to podocyte injury in an autocrine
manner.
It should be mentioned that the increase of the protein
level of AGT was not remarkable if compared with the
decrease of the level of mRNA. Although it is difficult to
explain the precise reason for this discrepancy, it is plausible
that some post-translational pathway suppressed the increase
of the AGT protein. It is also plausible that some negative
feedback pathway enhanced the degradation of AGT.
Another important finding we should mention is that
ATR2 expression also increased in both nephrotic models.

nephrin. AGT staining was increased and its staining pattern changed to a continuous linear-like pattern along the capillary loop. Positive AGT stain-
ing was detected at the apical surface of tubular cells in proteinuric states. (c) Dual-labeling IF analysis: AGT staining on day 10 of PAN nephropathy
was clearly different from the endothelial cell marker RECA-1 and the mesangial cell marker Thy1, and major portions of AGT were co-stained with
a podocyte marker synaptopodin.
Yamazaki et al. 7
We have previously reported that AT2R-mediated Ang II
action has a function opposite to AT1R-mediated Ang II
action.17 It is thought that the increase of AT2R is a protec-
tive response to suppress AT1R-mediated Ang II action.
It is reported that the local tissue RAS is enhanced if
the cells are stimulated,25,26,31 and that the activated local
RAS participates in tissue injury in an autocrine or par-
acrine manner. A recent report implied that if the cells
are stimulated with Ang II, the Ca++ channel was acti-
vated and the consequent increase of Ca++ influx
enhanced the local RAS in a positive feedback loop.31 In
this study we observed that glomerular mRNA expres-
sion of AGT increased remarkably in nephrotic models,
and the increase of AGT was also observed by immuno-
histochemistry. We observed that the increase in AGT
staining in liver is not clear in the nephrotic models.
These observations suggest that the local RAS may be
involved in the development of the nephrotic models.
ARB is widely used for patients showing proteinuria,
including in steroid-resistant nephropathy.32 In this
study, we also observed that the ARB treatment sup-
pressed the increase of the glomerular expression of
AGT, and inhibited the decrease of the expression of SD
molecules, and then ameliorated proteinuria in the
nephrotic model (Figure 4). The observations suggest
that the local RAS participated in SD dysfunction, and
that ARB treatment protected the SD by blocking the
positive feedback loop of the local action of Ang II.
This is the first report showing that the expression of
AGT in podocytes was evidently increased in nephrotic
states and the increased expression of glomerular AGT
was suppressed by ARB treatment. It is conceivable that
the promoted local RAS participates in the development of
nephrotic syndrome.
