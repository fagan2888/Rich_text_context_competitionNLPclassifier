Abstract
Background: The dimensions along which mortality is patterned in India remains unclear. We examined the specific
contribution of social castes, household income, assets, and monthly per capita consumption to mortality differentials in
India.
Methods and Findings: Cross-sectional data on 217 363 individuals from 41 554 households from the 2004­2005 India
Human Development Survey was analyzed using multiple logistic regressions. Mortality differentials across social castes
were attenuated after adjusting for household economic factors such as income and assets. Individuals living in the lowest
income and assets quintiles had an increased risk of mortality with odds ratio (OR) of 1.66 (95% CI = 1.23­2.24) in the
bottom income quintile and OR of 2.94 (95% CI = 1.66­5.22) in the bottom asset quintile. Counter-intuitively, individuals
living in households with lowest monthly consumption per capita had significantly lower probability of death (OR = 0.27,
95% CI = 0.20­0.38).
Conclusions: Mortality burden in India is largely patterned on economic dimensions as opposed to caste dimensions,
though caste may play an important role in predicting economic opportunities.

Introduction
Social class and economic well-being have been identified as
important social determinants that shape health inequalities
[1,2,3,4,5]. In India, social castes were previously considered as
a proxy for socioeconomic status and poverty [6]. A nationally
representative study on India based on the 1981 census indicated
that under-five child mortality in the lower castes, Scheduled
Tribes and Scheduled Castes, were significantly higher than upper
social castes [7]. The 1998­1999 India National Family Health
Survey (NFHS) demonstrated an increase in mortality rates of
neonates, infants, and under five children in progressively
disadvantaged social castes [8,9]. In more detail, a study on an
urban population of North India provided evidence that
cardiovascular-related mortality was more prevalent in higher
social castes whereas infections-related mortality was more
prevalent in lower social castes [10]. Similarly, based on the
analysis of the 1998-99 NFHS data, mortality was found to
differentially associate with household wealth and much less with
caste [8]. In this study, we provide an update of the most recent
association between social caste, economic factors and mortality in
India using individual data from the India Human Development
Survey 2004­2005.
Methods
Study Design and Data
The cross-sectional data was drawn from the India Human
Development Survey (IHDS) [11], a nationally representative,
multi-topic survey collected from November 2004 to October
2005. It sampled 215 754 alive individuals from 41 554 rural and
urban households in India. Villages and urban blocks formed the
primary sampling unit consisted of 150­200 households, from
which the sample of households was selected [11]. The survey
response rates were calculated as 92% for the total sample [11].
The lowest unit of observation was the individual member,
including 1609 who died in the previous year. Data on age and
gender for both living and deceased household members were
collected. The deceased household members were assumed to
have belonged in the similar caste and religion as other household
members and benefited from similar quality of living based on
shared household income, assets and consumption. One house-
hold was defined as a group of people living under one roof and
sharing the same kitchen.
Outcome and Predictors
The study outcome measure was a dichotomous variable
indicating whether an individual was dead (1) or alive (0).
Caste and religion of the household were self-identified by the
head of household. The caste categories were separated into
Brahmin, High Caste, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes
(Dalit), Scheduled Tribes (Adivasi), and No Caste. Other
Backward Classes, Dalits and Adivasis are considered the lower,
marginalized social groups in India [12]. The individuals in IHDS
that self-identified as No Caste were further stratified according to
their religion into Muslims, Christians and Sikhs and Jains
combined.

Detailed household income data was collected from queries of
over 50 different income sources. The queries were categorized
into eight major household income types: family farm income,
household agricultural wages, non-agricultural wages, salaries, net
business income, sum household remittance, government benefits,
and property and pensions. The current analysis used the
aggregated total income data and divided it into quintile groups
and a group that reported negative household income.
The variable for household assets was a score constructed from
the summation of 22 equally weighted dichotomous items
measuring household possessions of consumer goods and eight
aspects of housing quality. The household asset score was divided
into quintiles for the current analysis.
The consumption variable was constructed from a standard
battery of 47 expenditure questions taken from the short form of
India's National Sample Survey. These included 30 questions on
monthly expenditure and 17 questions on annual expenditure
reported for the previous year. The final consumption total was
calculated as the sum of the expenditure on monthly items and one
twelfth of the expenditure on annual items. The monthly
consumption per capita was divided into quintiles for the current
analysis.
Age was divided into six categories to capture the different stages
of life course: infants (,1 year), young children (1­5 years), children
or adolescents (6­18 years), young adults (19­44 years), middle-aged
adults (45­64 years) and elderly ( = 65 years). Other predictors were
gender and residency location. Residency location was divided into
three categories: rural villages, urban neighborhoods that were not
metropolitan cities (population 5000­100 000) and cities of
Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad
(population .100 000). The data on residency location was based
on the India Census 2001, where an urban neighborhood must have
a minimum population of 5000, at least 75% of male working
population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits and a population
density of at least 400 persons per square kilometer.
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic regression to model the association between
mortality at the individual level with demographic and socioeco-
nomic predictors. The binary response (y, dead or not) for each
individual were related to a set of categorical predictors, X,
(gender, age, residency location, religion, caste, income, assets,
monthly consumption per capita) and a fixed state effect by a logit
link function:
logit(pi
)~log½pi
=(1-pi
)~b0
zb(X)ze ð1Þ
The probability of an individual being dead is pi
. The
parameter b0
estimates the log odds of mortality for the reference
group, and the parameter b estimates with maximum likelihood,
the differential log odds of mortality associated with the predictor
X, as compared to the reference group. Odds ratios (OR) and
predicted probabilities (PP) with 95% CI were calculated. All
analyses were performed using the statistical program SAS 9.2
`surveylogit' procedure, adjusted for sample clustering at the level
of primary sampling units.
We used multivariable regression models to explore the effects
of social caste, household income, household assets, and monthly
consumption per capita on mortality separately, while adjusting
for gender, age and residency location. Secondly, we explored the
associations of the above factors together as they mutually adjusted
for each other. Furthermore, we explored these associations with
regards to age-specific mortality by adding interaction terms
between age and caste, income, assets and monthly consumption
per capita. We also explored the effects of caste on mortality when
modified by income, assets and monthly consumption per capita.
Social castes were stratified into five groups to observe mortality
differentials across asset quartiles in finer detail. Households were
re-grouped into asset quartiles to ensure at least one death is
present within each asset quartile stratified by caste.
Ethical Review
The India Human Development Survey was conducted under
the scientific and administrative supervision of the National
Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi and the University
of Maryland and was reviewed by the relevant ethics review board.
Formal written consent was obtained for all the surveys. This study
was reviewed by Harvard School of Public Health Institutional
Review Board and was considered exempt from full review as it
was based on an anonymous public use data set with no
identifiable information on survey participants.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
There were 217 363 individuals included in the analysis. There
were 1609 individuals, 0.7% of the total sample, who died in the one
year prior to household survey. The distributions of gender, religion,
social castes, and quintiles of household income, household assets
and monthly consumption per capita are listed in Table 1.
Socioeconomic Differentials in Mortality
The conditional odds ratios (OR) and predicted probabilities
(PP) of each subgroup is shown in Table 2 and Table S1. The
reference group represents a Hindu male between the ages of 19­
44, living in a metropolitan city. He belongs to the High Caste and
has household income, household assets and monthly consump-
tion per capita of the highest quintile.
Across social castes, we found significantly higher odds of
mortality in Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. However, after adjusting for all wealth factors:
income, assets and consumption per capita, the associations was
no longer statistically significant with the exception of Scheduled
Castes (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.23­2.41). Adjusting the effect of
social caste on mortality with household income and asset
ownership independently also resulted in the attenuation of caste
effect on mortality except in Scheduled Castes (Table S2). Within
the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and Jains populations outside the
traditional social caste system, no significant patterning in risk of
mortality was found.
We found a statistically significant association between house-
hold income and mortality. Compared to the top quintile, the
third and fourth quintile displayed significant and progressively
higher odds of mortality. Individuals living with household income
at the bottom quintile had 76% higher odds of mortality
(OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.35­2.29). Mortality differentials in
lower income quintiles were attenuated after mutually adjusting
for assets and expenditure, but remained statistically significant
(OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.23­2.24).
Similar to associations with household income, individuals with
household assets within the middle quintile and lower quintiles had
higher odds of mortality. Individuals who had little or no
ownership of household assets at the bottom quintile had odds
of mortality substantially higher than the top quintile (OR = 2.38,
95% CI = 1.42­3.99), which increased to almost three times
when adjusted for income and expenditure (OR = 2.94, 95%
CI = 1.66­5.22).

Unlike household income and assets ownership, a decrease in
monthly consumption per capita was associated with decreased
odds of mortality. Individuals living in households with the lowest
quintile of monthly consumption per capita were 73% less likely to
die than individuals from the top consumption quintile (OR = 0.27,
95% CI = 0.20­0.38).
Interaction of Socioeconomic Factors with Age
The mortality odds of infants younger than one year were
differentially associated with social castes. Furthermore, infants, young
children and adolescents up to 18 years old had mortality odds that
were differentially associated with quintiles of household assets.
Mortality at age 65 and above was significantly associated with being
in Scheduled Castes, the bottom income quintile and the bottom assets
quintile (Figure 1, Figure 2). No apparent interaction between age and
monthly consumption per capita was found (Table 3, Figure 3).
Interaction of Social Castes with Wealth Measures
There were significant interactions found between Scheduled
Castes and asset ownership, but not with household income or
monthly consumption per capita (Table S3). Upon stratification of
social castes, we found significant mortality differentials across
asset quintiles in High Caste and in Scheduled Castes (Table 4).
Discussion
Our analysis has the following findings related to patterns of
mortality differential among socioeconomic groups in India. First,
the mortality burden associated to lower castes was substantially
attenuated after accounting for the individuals' household income
and assets. Our analysis showed that infant mortality burden
remained associated with social castes. This mirrored previous
findings which suggested that there were differential attenuation by
economic factors in mortality burdens across life stages [9]. In our
case, the importance of economic factors was lesser in infants than
older ages. Although lower castes such as Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes are disadvantaged in terms of social standing and
materialistic wealth [13], recent studies supported views that
economic well-being, such as standard of living, is a more favorable
indicator of mortality and morbidity burden than social caste as an
intrinsic risk factor [8,9,14]. Results from sensitivity analysis
provided support that asset ownership, among the three wealth
measures, was the most important underlying factor in the mortality

differentials observed across social castes (Table S2). Furthermore,
individuals belonging to the High Caste and the bottom asset
quartile suffered from a higher mortality gap than Other Backward
Classes. This suggested that magnitude of inequality across asset
ownership may be an additional risk factor (Table 4).
In our study, we utilized three measure of economic well-being
to unravel the associations of wealth and mortality patterns. Low
household income and asset ownership continued to be strongly
associated with increased risk of overall mortality, but asset
ownership alone were strongly associated with age-specific
mortality. Total household income reflected short term, self-
reported wealth of a household. The benefit of higher income may
not trickle down to all members of the household at different ages.
The data did not reflect significant income effect on mortality risk
across age groups (Table 3).
Household asset ownership is a relatively accurate long-term
reflection of a household's economic well-being than income. Asset
ownership measure has lower recall bias; consumer goods and
housing quality can easily be verified by survey administrators.
Comparing the two different household wealth indicators, we

observed differential mortality gaps across age groups, mainly
concentrated in infants and elderly (Figure 1, Figure 2). Further-
more, the mortality gradient of the population over 64 years old
was much greater when deprived of asset ownership than of high
household income. This suggested that wealth in terms of
monetary resources translated less readily to standard of living in
elderly than ownership of household goods and housing quality.
Among different household goods and housing qualities, there
exists a differential mortality risk reduction for different age groups
as well. For instance, an electric fan may reduce risk of malarial
infection in infants and young children who stay at home, but not
for older children and adults. We observed significant interactions
between asset quintiles and age groups 0­18 years but not with
older adults, suggesting ownership of particular assets could affect
age groups selectively (Table 3).
Consumption captures monthly household expenditures such as
staple food cost and seasonal or sporadic expenditures such as
contributions to annual festivals, weddings and major medical
expenses. Surprisingly, our findings showed significantly lower odds
of mortality in individuals from lower quintiles of monthly
consumption per capita. Higher quintiles of monthly consumption
per capita captured poor households that might need to exert greater
marginal effort and percentage of household wealth than rich
households to obtain similar daily resources [15]. For example, a
woman in an urban center could switch on a tap for potable water in
the matter of seconds and a woman living in a rural village may
require several hours each morning and afternoon to line up, pump
and carry water for daily use, in turn reducing her available income-
generating time. Correlations of consumption with income quintiles
(r= 0.32) and asset quintiles (r= 0.48) were low, which suggested the
subpopulations with low wealth measured by household total income
and ownership of assets may not be the similar subpopulations that
were consuming the least per capita monthly. On the other hand,
high monthly consumption per capita was strongly associated with

high mortality risk in elderly individuals (Figure 3). This was likely due
to the increased medical expenses at older ages.
The findings of our study need to be considered along with
following limitations. Our 2004­2005 update of mortality
differential across socioeconomic factors in India was based on
cross-sectional survey data. Although it captured only a snap shot
of India's mortality patterns, it reinforced previous findings from
the NFHS 1998-1999 that economic well-being was a more robust
determinant of mortality risk than social caste [8,16]. However,
both findings related to mortality were influenced by recall bias of
deaths within the household[17]. Age of the deceased and
socioeconomically levels influence under-reporting of deaths
differentially. The Sample Registration System (SRS), which is a
large-scale demographic survey conducted in India, reports birth
rate, death rate and other fertility and mortality indicators at the
national and sub-national levels. The crude death rate from IHDS
2004-2005 was 7.4 deaths per 1000 population compared with 8.0
from the 2003 SRS (http://censusindia.gov.in/vital_statistics/
Vital_Rates/Vital_rates.aspx; accessed on December 1, 2010).
However, infant deaths from IHDS estimate was considerably
lower than the SRS estimate. Furthermore, our measures do not
capture all dimensions of socioeconomic status. Although multiple
studies have illustrated strong link between education levels of the
head of household and mother with childhood mortality
[5,16,18,19], education levels of individuals who died was not
collected from IHDS, thus related aspects such as maternal
education level and literacy rate were not included in our analysis.
Given the above, conclusions drawn from the mortality analyses
presented should qualitatively reflect the underlying patterns of
mortality differences across social castes and household economic
well-being[5].
Conclusions
Our study suggests a gradual decrease in importance of social
caste as an intrinsic mortality risk. Social caste influences
individuals' opportunities to income-generating work and asset
ownership. However when adjusted for these economic household
measures, the importance of social caste attenuates while the
economic measures remain strong indicators of the mortality gap.
Overall, mortality differential in India remains salient. Social caste
exerts strongest influence in mortality during the first year of life
while economically disadvantaged households bear heavier
burdens across several age groups.
