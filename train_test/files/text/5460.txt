Introduction
Like many other Sub-Saharan countries, South Africa has a
high rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which
includes the HIV (Key, Denoon, & Boyles, 1997). One of the
strategies that could be used to prevent STIs, HIV in particu-
lar, is the correct and consistent use of condoms. However,
condoms are not always used effectively and consistently,
which has led many researchers to investigate this issue
(Santelli et al., 1997). In addition, despite having much
knowledge on HIV and AIDS and how it is transmitted, peo-
ple still have unprotected sex with their partners. Even
though condom use is one of the elements in the ABC strat-
egy--Abstinence, Be Faithful, and Condom Use--when this
strategy was implemented in South Africa, it became clear
that it had little or no regard from local culture, especially
when you take into consideration the cultural beliefs that
women are expected to bear children once they are married.
This, therefore, makes it nearly impossible for women to
negotiate condom use with their partners.
The main purpose of this article, therefore, is to explore
the views of customarily married housewives to identify how
easy or difficult it is for them to negotiate condom use with
their husbands. Osuafor and Mturi (2014) stated that custom-
ary marriage takes place when two families are joined
together by the groom and bride through the payment of
lobola or the bride price. This practice is common among
Black SouthAfricans.According to the Department of Social
Development (2003), marriage symbolizes many social
ideas, and it embodies morality. Moreover, Corvino (2005)
further stated that marriage also result in an accomplishment,
stability, acceptance, and general good standing in communi-
ties as well as in personal commitment, sexual fidelity, and
emotional fulfillment. Marriage is often regarded as a protec-
tive institution when it comes to issues around exposure to
HIV and AIDS. This study seeks to explore the experiences
of customarily married housewives in their intimate relation-
ships with regard to condom use negotiation in Katlehong,
the East Rand of Gauteng Province in South Africa.
Condom use has helped in reducing the risk of HIV trans-
mission (Potts et al., 2008). However, evidence has shown
that the use of condoms has remained low, given the rise in
HIV infection among women, particularly those in steady
relationships (Osuafor, 2014). Maharaj and Cleland (2005)
argued that the promotion of condom use among married
couples have been neglected despite the fact that HIV is
mostly infectious through sexual intercourse within marital

Condom Usage Negotiation Among
Customarily Married Women in
Katlehong, Johannesburg
Nkosiyazi Dube1, Thobeka S. Nkomo1, and Priscalia Khosa1
Abstract
South Africa has the highest number of HIV-infected people in the Southern African Region, and of great concern is the fact
that cases of new infections among young people, especially young women and girls, are on the increase. The prevalence
of HIV and deaths caused by AIDS are still on the increase, whereas condom use, particularly in rural areas, remains low.
Consistent condom use is central to the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections
(STIs); yet, young men and women alike are hesitant to use condoms because of threats to their relationships, cultural roles,
and, at times, economic survival. This study explored the views of customarily married housewives regarding condom use
negotiation with their husbands. The findings point toward the need to empower women while they are still young so that
they can be assertive, financially independent, and able to make their own decisions with regard to their sexuality.

and cohabiting unions because of either prior infection by
one partner or due to infidelity. In South Africa, the HIV
prevalence has declined among women between the ages of
15 to 24 years, while there has been an increase in older
groups of between 30 to 39 years (Ross & Deverell, 2004).
Studies by Maharaj and Cleland (2005), Potts et al. (2008),
and Osuafor and Mturi (2014) found that there is a lot of
resistance concerning condom use, particularly in stable and
long-term relationships because of it being associated with
lack of trust, and the fact that there is no consistency in the
use of condoms. It is therefore significant to investigate fac-
tors related to condom use negotiation among customarily
married women.
The Overview of the South African HIV
Epidemic
Introduction
Brouard, Maritz, and Lazarus (2013) declared that the
National Department of Health estimated that in 2011, South
Africa was home to approximately 5.6 million people living
with HIV (PLHIV)--the highest number of PLHIV of any
country in the world. In addition, using the Actuarial Society
of South Africa's model for projecting the impact of HIV and
AIDS on the South African population in general, and find-
ings from household surveys undertaken by the Human
Sciences Research Council (HSRC), are slightly lower but
broadly in line with the Joint United Programme on HIV and
AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates of 5.3 million in addition. In
2012, the SouthAfrican National HIV Prevalence, Incidence,
and Behaviour Survey found out that 6.4 million people in
South Africa live with HIV. This figure represents a quarter
of the burden of HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa and
18% of the global burden (Shisana et al., 2014).
Women's Vulnerability to HIV and AIDS
South Africa has been rated among other African countries to
have one of the highest incidence and prevalence rates of HIV
and AIDS in the world (Brouard et al., 2013). According to
Ramjee and Wand (2012), women are particularly heavily
affected by the epidemic; they are at the greater risk of infec-
tion due to biological, social, and economic factors. Women
are also more vulnerable to HIV's and AIDS' impact for sev-
eral reasons, for example, the epidemic's potential of breaking
down the relationship between partners, parents, and children.
Furthermore, Ross and Deverell (2004) argued that due to
HIV and AIDS, "families fall apart and burden of sustaining
the family life is socially placed on women who are also dis-
advantaged by cultural and gender inequalities" (p. 259).
In terms of the risk of exposure to HIV infection, marriage
is often presented as a protective institution, because it is
assumed that in marriage, there is a monogamous fidelity
(Weed, Ericksen, & Birch, 2005). This assumption underlies
the traditional belief that when one enters into marriage,
sexual relationships should be done with the sole marriage
partner. However, it should be noted that where societies
apply different norms to sexual regulation, marriage becomes
an institution of vulnerability to HIV infection for women
(Department of Social Development, 2003). Anecdotal evi-
dence points to the idea that women continue to have unpro-
tected sex with their wife even when they know the man has
other wives. For example, Scamber (2009) stated that some
married men have multiple and concurrent wives who put
their partners at risk of getting infected. In 1998, a South
African Demographic and Health survey was conducted and
the results indicated that condom use in marriage was very
low; for example, only 5% of the men on the mines said they
used condoms with regular partners (Van Dyk, 2008).
According to Hardee and Leahy (2008), condom use is infre-
quent among married couples for multiple reasons, including
the desire for children and the widespread association of con-
doms with infidelity and lack of trust. In Kenya, 97% of peo-
ple in marriage or cohabitating relationships reported that
they did not use condom the last time they had sex. Similarly,
a study in Zaire found that women were not able to insist on
condom use--even when they suspected their husbands of
having multiple partners--because of their fear of an angry
reaction (Maharaj & Cleland, 2005). Moreover, many cou-
ples throughout Sub-Saharan Africa want to have large fami-
lies;thus,useofcondoms--particularlyifitisprolonged--may
be considered unacceptable (Central Bureau of Statistics
[Kenya], Ministry of Health, and ORC Marco, 2004). Based
on this study, it is clear that condoms are one of the least fre-
quently used contraceptive methods by married couples in
African countries.
Another contributing factor to women's vulnerability to
HIV is gender-based violence. According to Maharaj and
Cleland (2005), gender-based violence plays an overlooked
but significant role in women's vulnerability to HIV. Forced
unprotected sex obliterates women's ability to negotiate
condom use, and the threat of physical violence is a strong
deterrent to requesting condom use, particularly with a hus-
band who may view the request as an admission or accusa-
tion of infidelity. Social and legal factors that impede
women's empowerment also have important impacts on
married women's vulnerability to HIV. Hunter (2010) stated
that in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other parts of the
world, women have lower educational attainment and, sub-
sequently, fewer economic opportunities than men. Much of
women's work is unpaid or exists in the informal sector.
Furthermore, economic dependence on a husband makes it
difficult to leave an unsafe marriage or refuse unprotected
sex (Hardee & Leahy, 2008).
Conceptualization of Marriage
According to Giddens (2008), marriage is defined as "a
socially acknowledgeable and approved sexual union between
two adult individuals" (p. 207). However, in the SouthAfrican
society, it is socially acceptable for a man to have extramarital
Dube et al. 3
affairs which may place their partners at risk of contracting
HIV. This is one of the factors that lead to the increasing num-
ber of HIV and AIDS cases in South Africa.
There are different concepts and expectations that go
along with marriage. Scholars such as Mohlahlane (2004)
and Hunter (2007) have presented marriage using an opti-
mistic perspective, where the focus tended to be on the posi-
tive aspects, whereas this study explored other contributing
factors in marriages which put couples at risk of contracting
HIV and AIDS. Giddens (2008) argued that marriage nor-
mally forms the bases of family through procreation; that is,
it is expected that married couples will bear and raise chil-
dren. It is from this perspective of reproduction that disease
exchange transmission can happen among married couples.
Particularly as this is where non-use of contraception, espe-
cially condoms, occurs.
Condom Use and Power
Power is defined as an ability of the individual, or marriage
partners, to achieve aims or further their interests (Giddens,
2008). Max Weber, one of the sociology's founding figures
generally defines power as the "chance of man or a number
of men to realize their own will in a command action even
against the resistance of others who are participating in the
action" (Giddens, 2008, p. 71). Hence, power is viewed as a
pervasive aspect of all human relationships. In many differ-
ent societies, conflicts occur due to struggles for power,
because of how much power an individual or group has to
achieve or to realize as their own wishes at the expense of
others (Harvey, Bird, Galavotti, Duncan, & Greenberg,
2002). It is also argued that power in a society is all about
getting your own way, even when others do not want you to
(Parker & Aggleton, 2003).
In South Africa, power differentials are derived from eco-
nomic, political, and social relations, which include gender,
race, age, and locality (Squire, 2007). In this research, the
concept of power was considered because some activities or
experiences that influence people's daily living revolve
around who has power and how that power is utilized. In
male-dominated society, women do not hold a significant
power especially in decision making. This notion makes it
highly impossible for women to exercise their abilities to a
full potential. For example, in a marriage, the man may
always have power when it comes to sexual decision mak-
ing, like condom use. Women tend to listen to their husbands
because they are the ones who have the financial power in
the relationship, especially the housewives.
There have been so many debates on issues concerning
women empowerment, and this study reveals how women
perceive this notion of empowerment. This was done through
the research question as it tests the women's structure and
agency initiatives when it comes to condom use negotiation
with their partners. In South Africa, the structure of the econ-
omy and gender relations place women in a dependent rela-
tionship to men, often outweighing educational, political,
and other social gains (Rehle et al., 2010). The fact that
women are not empowered to exercise the power with their
partners can put their health status at risk, due to constant
inability to control decision making regarding sexual consent
and protection in marriage. Condom negotiation is made dif-
ficult due to a popular belief that the main objective of mar-
riage is to reproduce and expand the family; this perception
makes the use of protection to be difficult within marriages
(Walker, Reid, & Cornell, 2004).
Culture and Socialization
According to Williamson, Liku, McLoughlin, Nyamongo,
and Nakayima (2006), condom use among married and
stable couples is low and underresearched in developing
countries, even in countries with high HIV prevalence like
South Africa. Hence, introducing condoms into a long-
standing relationship, in spite of HIV risk, is likely to be
awkward (Williamson et al., 2006). Maharaj and Cleland
(2005) are of the view that most HIV prevention efforts
focus on premarital and extramarital sexual behavior, but in
areas with high HIV prevalence, the protective needs of
married and cohabiting couples are just as great and often
go unmet. Condom use by these couples is generally low,
with resistance from men and cultural norms commonly
cited as barriers to increased use.
In most African societies, culture plays a major role in
marriage. It is argued that women are more physiologically,
biologically, social-culturally, and economically vulnerable
than men when it comes to HIV infection because they are
commonly subjected to patriarchal social cultures that do not
allow them to exercise control over their health and well-
being (Department of Social Development, 2003). However,
it is a contested concept and it can be understood differently
depending on the context and background. For example,
most women in the African context do not have the power
and the initiative to challenge their husbands as it will be
viewed as culturally unaccepted behavior.
Socialization is another element which determines wom-
en's ability/inability to negotiate for condom use. According
to Korpi (2000), socialization refers to "a lifelong process of
social interaction through which we become a consistent and
recognizable person and acquire the physical, mental and
social skills needed for survival in the society" (p. 81). On the
contrary, Giddens (2008) views socialization as involving a
situation whereby "a helpless infant gradually becomes self-
aware, knowledgeable and a skilled person in terms of the
culture into which he or she was born" (p. 72). He further
argues that development occurs through learning, genetic
heritage, as well as through the norms, values, and roles we
learn through interacting with others. According to Giddens,
socialization can take place through different agencies, for
example, family, schools, peer relationships, and mass media.
It is through socialization that sexual taboos are created and
reinforced within different societies. If behavior is said to
be learned from childhood, it continues throughout life to
4 SAGE Open
influence people to modify their behavior in relation to the
people around them. Socialization is, therefore, important in
understanding women and their ability and/or inability to
negotiate for condom use when they are within the circles of
marriage as a social institution. Generally in theAfrican tradi-
tion, men are socialized to be in charge of decision making in
all aspects of life, and therefore, women have to succumb to
those decisions even if it is at the detriment of their health,
including the aspect of negotiating for condom use.
Research Method
Aim
The aim of this study was to explore the views of customarily
married women in Katlehong, Johannesburg, regarding con-
dom use negotiation with their husbands.
Research Question 1: What are the views of customarily
married women regarding condom use negotiation with
their husbands?
Research Approach and Design
The study utilized a qualitative research approach. Within
the qualitative research dimension, an exploratory-descrip-
tive research design was used to understand the phenomenon
studied. The study sample comprised of eight customarily
married housewives who were selected using snowball sam-
pling, which is a non-probability sampling technique.
Snowball sampling is useful in the investigation of sensitive
topics that explore issues that are too personal such as con-
dom use negotiation (Monette, Sullivan, DeJong, & Hilton,
2014). The criteria that were used for selection was that each
participant was supposed to be a resident of Katlehong's
Khumalo section and be a customarily married housewife
aged between 25 and 30 years. The age range of 25 to 30
years was used because it has been found that women within
this age range are the most affected and infected with HIV
and AIDS (Shisana et al., 2014).
In-depth one-on-one interviews were used to collect
data. All participants were interviewed individually due to
the sensitivity and personal nature of the study. A minimum
of 45 min and a maximum of 60 min were allocated per
interview. The interviews were guided by the use of a semi-
structured interview schedule that is comprised of open-
ended questions. The use of open-ended questions allowed
for flexibility and further probing of the responses that par-
ticipants gave. All the interviews were conducted on
Saturdays in the homes of the participants. Saturday was
chosen because it was the most convenient day for the par-
ticipants as their husbands were at work and they also did
not have the responsibility of fetching children to and from
school. Given the fact that an appointment was arranged
prior to the interview, there was less destruction during the
interviews. This ensured that privacy and confidentiality
were maintained. Thematic content analysis was used to
analyze data. Data analysis was based on notes that the
researchers took during the data collection process, through
which different themes were identified. Therefore, identi-
fied themes were then used as headings and sub-headings
guiding the reporting of the study findings.
Avoidance of harm, informed consent, voluntary partici-
pation, confidentiality, and anonymity were some of the
ethical considerations that were employed in the study.
Participants were informed beforehand about the potential
impact of the study so that they can make informed decision
about whether they wanted to participate or not. Also, infor-
mation about the purpose of the study, what participation is
required of them, and duration of participation was made
available to the participants. Moreover, participation was vol-
untary and refusal to participate did not have negative conse-
quences on any of the potential participants. Participants'
information was treated with utmost confidentiality regard-
less of their social, health, and socioeconomic status.
The study was ethically cleared by the University of the
Witwatersrand's nonmedical ethics committee. Limitations
that were inherent in the study might have included the provi-
sion of socially desirable answers by participants; however, to
minimize this, all participants were told that there was no
right or wrong answer.
Findings and Discussion
The findings from the study indicate that customarily mar-
ried housewives in Katlehong found it challenging to negoti-
ate for condom use with their husbands due to a variety of
reasons. Below is a discussion of the key findings that ema-
nated from the study.
Women's Financial Dependency on Men
According to Bassett and Mhloyi (1991), economic depen-
dence on men has been identified as a key structural factor at
the root of women's vulnerability to poverty, sexual violence,
unwanted childbirth, and STIs including HIV. This study
shows that the majority of women were financially depen-
dent on their male partners, and this was highlighted by one
participant who said, "I am not working because my husband
said, why should I work when he can provide for the fam-
ily?" Cases such as this pose a great issue as most of the
women interviewed did not have any source of capital for
their general and day-to-day requirements. This therefore
placed their husbands at very powerful positions and influ-
ence in terms of how their households were run. Even though
some women indicated that they were the ones who kept the
bank cards, they did not have the power to go and withdraw
cash without informing and getting permission from their
partners. For example, one participant said, " . . . I also have
a bank card, so I can withdraw cash anytime I want as long
as I phone my husband first and tell him about it and the
reason why I want the money." This response concurs with
Dube et al. 5
literature where Chitsike (2000) and Endley (2001) reported
that a question need to be raised of whether women's access
to cash income gives them more decision-making power
within the household, or does not always lead to greater deci-
sion-making power in the household or in wider society.
Furthermore, the statement shows that even though the cus-
tomarily married housewife appears to be handling the
finances, she does not have the power to spend as she pleases
and/or as need arises, but will have to clear with the partner
first, of which sometimes the partner refuses to authorize the
transaction. This concurs with what Rehle et al. (2010) found
that within the South African context, the structure of the
economy and gender relations places women in a dependent
relationship to men, which outweighs educational, political,
and other social gains. Selikow, Zulu, and Cedras (2002) also
highlighted that in one of the studies that they conducted
with males, some males indicated that they deliberately keep
their wives as housewives so that they can control them,
which gives males even more power to engage in sexual
intercourse with their wives without using condoms.
Culture and Condom Use
The authors are of the view that cultural norms such as the
need to have children, polygamy, and negative attitudes
toward condom use are viewed as not being African and will
promote promiscuity, thereby contributing to the inability to
negotiate for condom use. When a woman is married, there
are so many expectations from different people, especially
from the family that she is married into. She is expected to
bear children, and condom use is viewed as an obstacle that
can hinder the fulfillment of her expected role of child bear-
ing. Therefore, it becomes nearly impossible for her to intro-
duce the issue of condom use during sexual intercourse. One
customarily married housewife said,
Sometimes you can say that you want to use a condom but then
your partner forces you not to use it. Or maybe sometimes he
may say you are not faithful to him or you do not trust him, and
that you do not want to give him a child and threatens to leave
you. Why do you want to use condoms and stuff, especially
when you are married.
This statement shows that unequal gender relations within
married partners promote male dominance over their hus-
bands. It is also an indication that some women are coerced
into engaging in un-protective sexual practices with their
partners due to the fear of being dumped or divorced. This
poses a high risk to women because a condom is only seen as
a preventive measure for unwanted pregnancy and not as a
preventive measure for sexually transmitted diseases, which
includes HIV/AIDS.
Moreover, Walker et al. (2004) also stated that condom
negotiation is made difficult due to a popular belief that the
main objective of marriage is to reproduce and expand the
family, and this perception makes the use of protection to be
difficult within marriage. This idea was supported by one
participant who said,
if you fail to reproduce in your marriage you will be labeled as a
barren and an evil woman and in some instances your husband's
family will encourage their son to look for and marry someone
else who will bear children for him.
This idea of expansion and reproduction is embedded within
the cultural practices and beliefs in SouthAfrica and it makes
it difficult for women to disentangle it. Furthermore, within
the sphere of cultural practice and expectations, one partici-
pant stated, "the payment of lobola (pride price) makes the
woman to be like her husband's asset or property that he
owns, to the extent that the husband decides on what the
woman can do and at what time." This cultural practice
which is common, not only to South Africa but also in other
African countries, makes it difficult for women to negotiate
for condom use with their husbands as their male counter-
parts normally claim that they paid for them; therefore, they
should respect and listen to what they order them to do. Also,
once the lobola is paid, the aunts of the woman emphasizes
to the woman that she must be strong and endure whatever
circumstances she is subjected to. It is common knowledge
that it is a disgrace or embarrassment to the family should a
woman decide to return home when facing challenges in her
marriage. In such instances, the woman may not be accepted
back home. Therefore, the decision of women on whether or
not to use condoms is shaped by factors such as culture.
Conformity Associated With Marriage
According to Schulman (2006), women find themselves in a
difficult position of having to conform to the values and
norms of society for them to be socially accepted.
Traditionally, the decision-making process is regarded as an
exclusive preserve of the male folks, which places women at
an inferior position in marriage. The fact that there should be
consultations before one takes a decision shows that mar-
riage reinforces the structural ideas of patriarchy, where
males become dominant over women. Almost half of the
women interviewed expressed fear of losing their partners,
especially after suggesting that they need to use condoms.
This is a sensitive area that women felt that even though they
might test HIV positive, they will never disclose to their part-
ners due to the fear of the implications, for example, domes-
tic violence and stigma. One participant said,
I am fully aware of the manner in which HIV spreads, and the
things that I can do to protect myself from being infected. But I
am married and I feel that I have little or no voice to suggest to
my partner that we use condoms, because I can lose my marriage
through that and also my man.
Women find themselves in a compromising position and
being unable to voice out their concerns due to the fear of the
6 SAGE Open
unknown. It was clear that some women did things not just
because they wanted to but because they wanted to conform
to certain popular beliefs and expectations from their male
partners. It also appeared that in some marriages, women
didn't have much say in terms of reproductive health issues,
for example, when to start a family.
However, it was said to be an innate expectation that once
one gets married, she should not be worried about falling
pregnant, even though it might not be her choice. This is also
due to the inequalities that the institution of marriage pres-
ents to married partners. Losing one's man takes precedence
to one's life and right to good health. To support this argu-
ment, one participant also said, "When one gets married,
condom use automatically falls away as you will no longer
be afraid of getting pregnant because as a woman you are
required to start having children and this means non-use of
contraceptives of any type." This statement is an indication
that women were at high risk of contracting STIs due to their
inability to negotiate for condom use with their husbands.
Hunter (2004) also pointed out that society, through oral
praise poems, puts pressure on men to have as many children
as they can, as he will be viewed as a powerful and strong
man who might be respected within his society.
Implications and Recommendations for
Social Work Practice
An intensive effort is required from social work services,
regarding support, education, and enhancement of all pro-
grams related to HIV and AIDS transmission. This could be
done through the involvement of all affected family mem-
bers in all HIV andAIDS related programs within Katlehong.
However, there is a need to create a mutually trusting envi-
ronment to enable the establishment of a functional and
positive flow of communication between customarily mar-
ried couples. This strategy might serve to effectively break-
down the negative effects of silence and the abuse of power.
There is a need for improved awareness and prevention
campaigns on HIV and AIDS. This might enhance in mov-
ing away from traditional taboo that a man is responsible
for decision making, including sexually related issues that
affects women. Furthermore, professional support from
social workers is recommended through active engagement
in empowering couples and communities to access avail-
able resources with an aim of building successful and
healthier relationships. By doing this, the social work pro-
fession will be on the lead in spearheading psychosocial
challenges related to social justice and power struggles
within customary marriages in different communities.
Conclusion
The study showed that the majority of the participants could
not negotiate for condom use because they were dependent on
their husbands for financial support, which reduced their
chances of having sexual control in their relationships. In
addition, such tendencies are mostly perpetuated by the soci-
etal expectations and roles that men are the breadwinners and
women are supposed to stay at home and look after the chil-
dren. Furthermore, the study revealed that some of the partici-
pants choose not to go against their husbands' decision of not
using a condom during sexual intercourse due to fear of sepa-
ration and/or divorce. This is mostly attributed to some of the
cultural beliefs that a man has the whole power to mandate
what the woman can or cannot do after paying lobola. The
study also found that the majority of women fear to challenge
their male partners with the view that it was socially unac-
ceptable in the traditional African society. This is an indica-
tion that women, especially housewives, still subscribe to the
societal roles that are said to be unfit for women. Hence, the
study revealed that the majority of the participants had very
little involvement in the decision making concerning their
sexual activities. Findings showed that condom use was nega-
tively associated with lack of trust in the relationship, and
therefore, women were willing to forgo their independence in
decision making even though they might have suspected that
their husbands were having an extra marital affair. Therefore,
studies on gender and HIV are imperative given the fact that
HIV vulnerability among women is prevalent and associated
with gender inequality, gendered power relations, inhibitive
social structure, low sexual agency among women, forced
sex, lack of sexual autonomy and sexual pleasure-seeking,
and economic dependence on men.
In conclusion, it is apparent that women are unable to
negotiate for condom use in their relationships due to their
financial dependency on their husbands. Therefore, there is a
need for women to be empowered while they are still young,
through education, so that they can be assertive, financially
independent, and able to make their own decisions with
regard to their sexual-related matters. Furthermore, HIV and
AIDS prevention strategies have to incorporate issues around
social, cultural, and psychological aspects of behavior
change to win the fight against this epidemic.
