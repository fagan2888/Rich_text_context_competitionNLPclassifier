Introduction
It has been argued that a competitive business environment
and its rapid expansion beyond national boundaries has
undoubtedly become a necessity for companies to succeed in
the long run and expand their customer base (Aboulnasr,
2007). Such is the pressure to make their presence noticeable
globally that many companies are inevitably spreading their
wings beyond their national boundaries and expanding inter-
nationally. As a matter of fact, international expansion and
distribution of products beyond national borders is a result of
the emergence of two important phenomena, namely, global-
ization and the falling of trade barriers through the establish-
ment of different kinds of international organizations and
associations. At present, the globally connected marketplace
and reviewing what influences consumers' intention of pur-
chasing foreign products have evolved as topics of much
importance. Studies have been conducted in different regions
of the world with the intention of understanding what actu-
ally affects consumers' purchase intention of foreign prod-
ucts (Haque, Rahman, & Haque, 2011; Mostafa, 2010).
This is partly driven by the realization that consumers
from different countries are distinct from each other not only
culturally (Sohail & Sahin, 2010) but also economically and
demographically (Essoussi & Merunka, 2007). Under such
circumstances, studies conducted in the context of one coun-
try cannot be easily generalized in the context of another
country (Sohail & Sahin, 2010). To understand which factors
are affecting consumers' intention of purchasing foreign
products, it is important to conduct research in the context of
different countries as consumers are unique in their spending
preferences.
Available literature reveals that previous studies have
been conducted in the context of different countries with the

Purchase Intention of Foreign Products:
A Study on Bangladeshi Consumer
Perspective

Abstract
The current research aims to investigate various factors that influence consumers' intention of buying foreign products. The
data were collected by means of self-structured questionnaires from a total of 260 Bangladeshi consumers residing in the
two major cities of the country, Dhaka and Chittagong. At the initial stage, statistical analyses, particularly descriptive analysis
as well as exploratory factor analysis, were conducted using SPSS, after which structural equation modeling was run by using
AMOS. The findings have established that brand image and quality of foreign products carry significant positive influence on
purchase intention of foreign products. However, religiosity leaves a significant negative effect on the purchase intention of
foreign products. Furthermore, findings have also revealed that the image of the country of origin carries a significant positive
effect on brand image but ethnocentrism carries a significant negative effect on perceptions about the quality of foreign
products in their purchase intention. The major contribution of the current study is that it focuses on Bangladesh, as there
is a vacuum in contemporary literature on this topic in the context of Bangladeshi consumers. The findings derived from the
study could facilitate marketers in the creation of effective marketing strategies and at the same time are also valuable for
academicians as well as consumers at large.

objective of identifying which factors affect consumers'
intention of buying foreign products: America (Shimp &
Sharma, 1987; Yoo & Donthu, 2005); China, United States,
and Taiwan (Lin & Chen, 2006); China and Japan (X. Wang
& Yang, 2008; Wei, 2008); Egypt (Mostafa, 2010); United
Kingdom (Diamantopoulos, Schlegelmilch, & Palihawadana,
2011); Iran (Fakharmanesh & Miyandehi, 2013); and
Malaysia (Haque et al., 2011; Tabassi, Esmaeilzadeh, &
Sambasivan, 2012). Even though much is known in aca-
demic literature regarding this topic in the context of differ-
ent countries, there is a scarcity of research on this issue
pertaining directly to Bangladesh. Thus, it is imperative that
this study is conducted to gain insights into what influences
Bangladeshi consumers' intentions to purchase foreign
products.
Literature Review
Purchase Intention
Traditionally, the term intention is defined as the antecedents
that stimulate and drive consumers' purchases of products
and services (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2010). One of the
most common approaches undertaken by marketers in gain-
ing an understanding about consumers' actual behavior is
through studying their intentions (Blackwell, Miniard, &
Engel, 2006; Ghalandari & Norouzi, 2012). Kim and
Pysarchik (2000) have demonstrated the existence of a strong
correlation between these two respective constructs. Hence,
they assert that purchase intention serves as an alternative for
measuring consumers' purchase behavior. Therefore, con-
sumers' intention toward a particular behavior has remained
the central focus of well-known theories like theory of rea-
soned action (TRA).
This claim is also supported by Azjen (1991) who men-
tion that intention is the factor that motivates consumers and
in turn influences their behavior. To a greater extent, it
reveals how hard consumers are willing to try, as well as the
amount of effort they intend to exert for performing a respec-
tive behavior. According to them, the probability that a par-
ticular behavior will actually be performed by individuals
largely relies on the strength of their intentions. When the
intentions of performing certain behavior are strong, there
are higher likelihoods that the respective behavior will be
performed.
Image of the Country of Origin
Following the classic work by Schooler dating back to 1965,
some 700 studies have been conducted in different parts of the
globe by prominent researchers on the topic of country of ori-
gin (Essoussi & Merunka, 2007). The numerous studies con-
ducted on country of origin have eventually made it an essential
tool (Ryan, 2008) and indeed a phenomenon in the arena of
international marketing and consumer behavior (Sohail &
Sahin, 2010; Tigli, Pirtini, & Erdem, 2010). Therefore, coun-
try of origin has occupied an integral position in understand-
ing consumers' behavior in the literature of international
marketing, specifically consumers' preferences and pur-
chases of foreign products (Kumara & Canhua, 2009; Zhang,
1996). Several researchers have noted that country of origin
is the place where the corporate headquarters of the company
a product or brand belongs to is located (Kim & Pysarchik,
2000; Thanasuta, Patoomsuwan, Chaimahawong, &
Chiaravutthi, 2009; X. Wang & Yang, 2008). It has been
mentioned by Laroche, Papadopoulos, Heslop, and Mourali
(2005) that the importance of products' origin has increased
today due to trade liberalization among foreign countries and
globalization of national economies. Thus, in their words,
with the inception of the first-ever work on country of origin
by Schooler, the study of product origin has turned into one
of the most lucrative research areas in the arena of interna-
tional marketing.
Koubaa (2008) has also stated that the image of the coun-
try from where a particular brand originates remarkably
affects consumers' perception of the brand's image. From a
similar perspective, it has been noted by Hsieh, Pan, and
Setiono (2004) that when consumers hold a favorable per-
ception toward a brand's country of origin they appreciate
brands from that particular country, which in turn enhances
the brand's image; on the contrary, a country's negative
image in the eyes of the consumers prevents them from pur-
chasing its brands. Thus, consumers' intention to purchase
brands is in harmony with their impressions about the image
of the products' country of origin. It has been revealed that
country of origin's image directly affects consumers pur-
chase intention (Josiassen & Assaf, 2010; X. Wang & Yang,
2008). However, other researchers such as Diamantopoulos
et al. (2011) have shown that country of origin's image
affects consumers' intention of buying foreign product
through brand image. Based on the above discussion, the fol-
lowing hypotheses are drawn:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Country of origin image has a signifi-
cant positive effect on brand image.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Brand image mediates the relation-
ship between country of origin image and purchase
intention.
Religiosity
Religion is one of the most vital elements in the lives of
every individual (Khraim, 2010) because people from differ-
ent religious backgrounds are obligated to follow the princi-
ples and beliefs prescribed by their respective religions
(Rehman & Shabbir, 2010). Religion cannot be considered a
mere short-lived fad that changes over time; rather, it is a
permanent pillar that remains in the lives of believers forever
(Khraim, 2010). As a matter of fact, religion is one of the
most prominent aspects in society, influencing every aspect
Haque et al. 3
of a person's life, lifestyle, attitude, belief, behavior, and
habit (Hanzaee & Ramezani, 2011; Mokhlis, 2009). It pro-
vides people with a value system and, most importantly,
gives them their identity (Essoo & Dibb, 2004). Religion is
an important factor that guides peoples' consumption habits
and at the same time has an influential impact on their pur-
chases of products as consumers from different religions are
encouraged to abide by their religious principles in their
selection of products (Essoo & Dibb, 2004). Even though
religion affects individuals' behavior and their consumption
habits, it has been explained by Mukhtar and Butt (2012) that
its impact varies from individual to individual in accordance
to their religiosities.
Prior literature reveals that the construct of religiosity has
been extended to studying consumers' purchase intention of
foreign products (Haque et al., 2011; Tabassi et al., 2012)
and how religiosity is associated with consumers' intention
of purchasing products that come from foreign countries.
The result of the study has revealed that as consumers'religi-
osity increases, their intention of buying products coming
from foreign countries decreases. Similar results have also
been demonstrated by Tabassi et al. (2012). It has been
revealed by them that consumers are unwilling to purchase
products from foreign countries as religiosities of consumers
are negatively associated with their intention of purchasing
these products. Based on the above discussion, the following
hypothesis is drawn:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Religiosity has a significant negative
effect on purchase intention of foreign products.
Ethnocentrism
The sociological concept of ethnocentrism's origin can be
traced back to the early 20th century, with the pioneering
work of Sumner (1906). It is solely a social factor that
revolves around the notion that individuals tend to perceive
their own group (known as in-group) as superior (Sumner,
1906). As such, individuals who belong to the same group
are considered in-groups and individuals who do not belong
to the group are considered out-groups and are believed to be
harmful to the in-group (Ueltschy, 1998). Thus, it has been
stated by Chryssochoidis, Krystallis, and Perreas (2007) that
the division of individuals into two distinct groups (in-group
and out-group) makes ethnocentrism a concept that is dichot-
omous in nature.
Watson and Wright (2000) have investigated the effect of
ethnocentrism on consumers'attitude toward foreign products
in the case where the local market does not provide a domestic
substitute for particular product(s). The results of the study
have shown that ethnocentric consumers favor products that
come from neighboring nations that have similar cultural
backgrounds. Consumer ethnocentrism also plays a role in the
quality evaluation of foreign versus domestic products.
Ethnocentric consumers tend to perceive the quality of local
products as superior to the quality of foreign products (C. L.
Wang & Chen, 2004). Similar statements have also been
made by a number of past studies as their findings have
revealed that ethnocentrism leads to an unfavorable effect on
foreign products' quality, and later, foreign products' quality
positively affects consumers' intention of purchasing the
products (Ettenson & Klein, 2005; Mostafa, 2010; Yoo &
Donthu, 2005). Based on the above discussion, the following
hypotheses are drawn:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Ethnocentrism has a significant neg-
ative effect on quality of foreign products.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): Foreign product quality mediates the
relationship between ethnocentrism and purchase
intention.
Brand Image
In the study of marketing, branding has emerged as an inte-
gral concept (Meenaghan, 1995). Through the years, schol-
ars have described the concept of branding in different ways
(Meenaghan, 1995). Brand image is a result of the marketing
activities that are undertaken by companies (Hsiung, 2011).
Hawkins and Mothersbaugh (2010) have noted that brand
image, in essence, is the thought that arises in peoples'minds
when they come across certain brands. In examining the
effect of brand image on consumers' loyalty toward brands,
it has been stated by Hu, Jou, and Liu (2009) that brand
image is comprised of three components, namely, the image
of the product itself, followed by the corporation's image,
and finally the image of competitors'brands. It has been con-
cluded by them that for enhancing consumers'loyalty toward
a brand, it is important to improve the image of the product
as well as the corporate image.
Yagci (2001) has found that brand image is a significant
factor that not only plays an influential role in affecting con-
sumers' quality perception and attitude toward products but,
at the same time, also plays an influential role in consumers'
purchases of products as it is a strong predictor of consum-
ers' purchase intention as well. On the reverse side, the
opposite has been uncovered by Eze, Yee and Wamala
(2012) as consumers did not form their intentions of pur-
chasing products based on the image of the brand, indicating
that brand name is not prioritized by consumers in making
their purchases. Moreover, Shah et al. (2012) have studied
how consumers'purchase intentions are affected by the con-
cept of branding. According to them, a product's core brand
image is comprised of two elements, namely, brand knowl-
edge and brand preference, and both elements affected
intention of purchasing as expected. In examining what fac-
tors affect Iranian consumers' purchase intention of foreign
products, it has been revealed by Fakharmanesh and
Miyandehi (2013) that brand image is one of the important
factors; thus, they have concluded that consumers rely on
brand image when intending to purchase foreign products.
Based on the above discussion, the following hypothesis is
drawn:
4 SAGE Open
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Brand image has a significant posi-
tive effect on purchase intention of foreign products.
Foreign Product Quality
Kirmani and Baumgartner (2000) have pointed that a prod-
uct's quality is the extrinsic and intrinsic cue that is taken
into consideration by consumers in evaluating its perfor-
mance. Consumers' assessment of quality has also been con-
sidered an attitudinal judgment based on which consumers
evaluate the extent to which brands fulfill their expectations
(Rafi, Ali, Saqib, Choudhary, & Akhtar, 2012). C. L. Wang,
Chen, Chan, and Zheng (2000) have pointed out that quality
resembles the functional value of a product, which in turn
motivates consumers in making their choices. It has been
noted by C. L. Wang and Chen (2004) that Chinese consum-
ers' perception regarding the quality of products is an influ-
ential predictor of their purchase intention for both local and
foreign products. Similarly, product quality is one of the ele-
ments highly taken into consideration by consumers from
developing countries such as Pakistan when they purchase
nonlocal products, as revealed by Khattak, Saeed, and Shah
(2011). Prior study has shown that in the purchase of foreign
products, ethnocentrism is an important factor that has the
potential of affecting consumers' perception toward foreign
products' quality; therefore, consumer ethnocentrism is an
influential factor that is considered by consumers in evaluat-
ing the quality of foreign goods (Mostafa, 2010). Several
past studies have taken into account the relationship between
ethnocentrism and the quality of foreign products when it
comes to understanding consumers'intention of buying these
products (Ettenson & Klein, 2005; Mostafa, 2010; Yoo &
Donthu, 2005). In accordance with their findings, ethnocen-
trism has a negative effect on imported products' quality and
the latter leaves a positive effect on consumers' intention of
purchasing foreign products. Based on the above discussion,
the following hypothesis is drawn:
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Quality of foreign products has a sig-
nificant positive effect on purchase intention of foreign
products.
Proposed Framework of the Research
As represented in Figure 1, the theoretical framework of the
research concentrates on consumers' purchase intention of
foreign products based on the variables extracted from the
literature review, namely, country of origin image, brand
image, religiosity, ethnocentrism, and foreign product quality.
The model links all these respective variables together in one
frame and also illustrates how they are related to each other.
From the figure below, it can be seen that the framework is
comprised of one dependent variable (purchase intention),
two mediating variables (brand image and foreign product
quality), and three independent variables (country of origin
image, religiosity, and ethnocentrism). In addition, it also
reveals the basis on which the hypotheses have been derived.
Method
As the study at hand upholds the objective of exploring the
factors affecting consumers' intention of buying foreign
products, particularly concentrating on Bangladeshi consum-
ers, it is essential to build the study by collecting data from
Figure 1. Framework of the research.
Haque et al. 5
the consumers of Bangladesh to make sure that the data col-
lected are a good representation of the Bangladeshi popula-
tion. The data required for the study have been gathered
through the distribution of self-administered questionnaires.
All the items were developed based on the literature review.
Initially, the questionnaire was developed in English and
later it was translated into Bengali with the help of a profes-
sional translator. The key reason for translating the questions
into Bengali was to make it convenient for the respondents to
understand as well as answer the questions appropriately.
The items were then pretested on a sample of 38 respondents,
including experts, to see whether the items were understand-
able to the respondents. Based on the feedback, a few items
were rephrased and a few items were deleted from the final
version of the questionnaire. For reliability analysis,
Cronbach's alpha test was carried out. An alpha value of .878
shows the high reliability of the questionnaire. Hence, the
results of the study showed that the questions in the question-
naire were reliable and valid, which indicated that the ques-
tionnaire can be utilized for collecting data for the actual
study.
As the study at hand upholds the objective of exploring
the factors affecting consumers' intention of buying foreign
products, particularly concentrating on Bangladeshi consum-
ers, it is essential to build the study by collecting data from
the consumers of Bangladesh to make sure that the data col-
lected are a good representation of the Bangladeshi popula-
tion. A convenience sampling method has been employed to
collect the required data from the two major cities of the
country, Dhaka and Chittagong. The underlying reason for
specifically selecting these two destinations rests on the fact
that Dhaka and Chittagong are the main cities of the country.
These two cities have innumerable shopping malls, with the
widest variety and array of foreign (imported) products.
Currently, there are 43 shopping malls in Dhaka city and 29
shopping malls in Chittagong city (Wikipedia, 2014). As
such, this study has decided to cover 30% of the shopping
malls, which were selected randomly, for data collection.
Based on the ratio, 22 malls were selected from Dhaka city
and 9 malls were selected from Chittagong city. Moreover,
these two cities have the highest number of foreign products
in the local market, as well as consumers who have the high-
est interaction with foreign products. One of the main advan-
tages of convenience sampling method is that this specific
method greatly helps researchers gather the required data
from a sizable number of respondents in a relatively short
span of time (Hair, Babin, Money, & Samouel, 2003; Hair,
Bush, & Ortinau, 2009).
The respondents were requested to answer the questions
on a 7-point rating scale, where 1 stands for strongly dis-
agree and 7 stands for strongly agree. Initially, 260 question-
naires were given out to Bangladeshi consumers in different
shopping malls in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong. This is
because this study has used structural equation modeling
(SEM) for data analysis, where the minimum sample size
required is 200 to conduct such analysis, as suggested by
Hair et al. (2009). Moreover, Sekaran (2003) mentioned that
the appropriate size of a sample for most of the research proj-
ects is a sample size that consists of more than 30 samples
but is less than 500. Thus, in reference to this particular rule,
the sample size of the study at hand is 260 (detailed data
distribution is presented in Table 1). However, for the pur-
pose of the study, 30 questionnaires were discarded, as they
were not fully completed by the respondents, as a result of
which 230 questionnaires were used for statistical analysis.
Hence, this justifies the sample size used in this study as the
sample size is more than 200.
At the initial stage, descriptive analysis as well as validity
testing through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was con-
ducted through SPSS. According to Hair et al. (2009), it is
important to conduct EFA as it helps researchers in summa-
rizing the information gathered from a particular set of data.
Later, SEM was run through AMOS to test the measurement
model and, finally, analysis was completed by testing the
full-fledged structural model and verifying the hypotheses
that have been derived for the study.
Results and Discussions
Respondents' Demographic Profile
Of the participants, 63% were male while 37% were female.
In the survey conducted, most of the participants were in the
age group of 20 to 29 years, which is 44.8%. Another 23% of
the participants were in the age group of 30 to 39 years while
13.5% were in the age group of 40 to 49 years.Atotal of 13%
of the participants were below the age of 20. A small percent-
age of the participants were in the age group of 50 to 59 years
(3.5%). The minority of the participants were in the age
group of 60 to 69 years, which accounted for only 2.2% of
the total participants. Most of the participants were Muslims,
which accounted for 80.9%; 13.5% were Hindus, 3.5% were
Buddhists, and 2.2% were Christians. In terms of academic
qualification of the respondents, 35.7% had master's degrees,
27.4 % had completed honors, 20.4% had completed high
school, 13.9% had completed secondary school, and 5.8% of
the participants had PhDs.
EFA
Hair et al. (2009) have mentioned that it is important to con-
duct factor analysis, as it helps researchers in summarizing
the information gathered from a particular set of data.
However, prior to proceeding with EFA, two tests, namely,
Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's Test of
Sphericity, should be verified for checking the factorability
of data (Pallant, 2007). Tabachnick, Fidell, and Osterlind
(2001) have indicated that the value of the first test (KMO)
ranges from 0 to 1, and for an appropriate analysis it is
important to have at least a value of 0.6, and for the latter
6 SAGE Open
(Bartlett's Test of Sphericity) it is important to attain a sig-
nificant p value (p < .05). After running both of these respec-
tive tests through SPSS, it was observed that the results of
both fell within the acceptable range, indicating that the
researcher can run EFA. The outcomes of the tests are shown
below in Table 2.
From EFA, 20 items have been derived and all the items
are considered to be significant as they managed to load
with a value greater than 0.50, and any loading above this
value is considered to be practically significant by Hair et al.
(2009). All the five respective components successfully
attained eigenvalues higher than one, as recommended by
Pallant (2007); in total, all the five components together
explained 64.696% of the total variance (Table 3).
Cronbach's alpha has also been calculated for all the items
of the five variables. It can be seen that all items under each
of the variables are reliable as they all have surpassed the
minimum value of .60 suggested by Hair, Black, Babin, and
Anderson (2010).
Fitness Assessment of the Structural Model
For gauging the fitness of a particular model to a set of data,
it is obligatory for researchers to employ several goodness-
of-fit statistics (Brown, 2006).All the fit indices that are used
for assessing a model's fitness fall generally under three dif-
ferent respective categories of fitness, which are commonly
known as absolute fit, incremental fit, and parsimonious fit
(Brown, 2006; Byrne, 2010; Hair et al., 2010; Kline, 2011).
Each of the categories is comprised of a number of different
types of indices as well as their required values (Table 4).

Evaluation of the Structural Equation Model
The result of the model revealed that the model is acceptable
as it attained the required values for each of the indices as
follows: root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) =
.074, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = .908, comparative fit
index (CFI) = .908. normed 2 = 2.263 (Table 5, Figure 2).
Results of Hypothesis Testing
As shown in Table 6, it can be observed that all the five
hypothesized paths were significant at a p value < .05.
Country of origin image has a significant positive effect on
brand image in Bangladeshi consumers' intention of pur-
chasing foreign products, indicating that H1 is accepted as the
standardized regression weight = .587, standard error = .083,
critical ratio = 7.037, level of significance for regression
weight = significant at .000. H2 of the study has also been
accepted, demonstrating that religiosity has a significant
negative effect on Bangladeshi consumers' purchase inten-
tion of foreign products as the standardized regression weight
= -.236, standard error = .106, critical ratio = -2.225, and
level of significance for regression weight = .026. H3 was
not rejected as the estimates of the structural path demon-
strated that standardized regression weight = -.186, standard
error =.065, critical ratio = -2.884, level of significance for

regression weight = .004. Therefore, it can be stated that in
the case of Bangladeshi consumers, ethnocentrism does
carry a negative effect on the quality of foreign product. H4
was also not rejected as the standardized regression weight =
.367, standard error = .116, critical ratio = 3.167, and level of
significance for regression weight = .002. Therefore, brand
image is highly taken into account by Bangladeshi consum-
ers during the purchase of imported products. Last, the qual-
ity factor of foreign products also plays a significant role
when Bangladeshi consumers are buying foreign products as
indicated by the structural path, with standardized regression
weight = .531, standard error =.120, critical ratio = 4.412,
and level of significance for regression weight = significant
at p value 000. Therefore, H5 was also accepted.
Validity testing. Besides the baseline model, the study needs
to consider the overall measurement model to test the valid-
ity of the analysis. To confirm construct validity of the study,
it requires to assess convergent, discriminant, and face valid-
ity. Most of the factor loadings for each construct (more than
.70), average variance extracted (AVE; more than .50), and
construct reliability (more than .50) show the presence of
convergent validity, while discriminant validity is confirmed
with the positive difference between AVE and squared cor-
relation (r2) of the constructs. Here, in all cases AVE is big-
ger than squared multiple correlation value and gives the
evidence of uniqueness for each construct. In addition, theo-
retical support of the literature proves the face validity of the
constructs (see Table 7).
Testing mediation effect. In addition to the five basic hypoth-
eses, the study also tends to test the mediation effect of brand
image and foreign product quality between country of origin
and purchase intention, as well as ethnocentrism and pur-
chase intention, respectively. In confirming the mediating
effect of brand image, both the path coefficients of country

of origin to brand image and brand image to purchase inten-
tion should be multiplied, whereas the multiplication value
should be greater equal or greater than the threshold value
(.08). In addition, p of these effects should be significant
(Rucker, Preacher, Tormala & Petty, 2011). For the case at
hand, in seeking practical importance, the multiple effects of
both these relationships (.59 × .28 = .16) is greater than the
threshold value (.08) and Sobel's test also shows the signifi-
cant p value, which demonstrates the statistical significance.
In the same manner, to demonstrate the mediation effect
of foreign products'quality, both the path coefficients of eth-
nocentrism to foreign products'quality and foreign products'
quality to purchase intention should be multiplied, whereas
the multiplication value should be greater than .08. In addi-
tion, p of these effects should be significant (Rucker et al.,
2011). For the case at hand, in seeking practical importance,
the multiple effects of both these relationships are very close
to the threshold value (.08). Likewise, Sobel's test also shows
the significant p value, which demonstrates the statistical
significance. Hence, it can be said that H6 and H7 are not
rejected and brand image as well foreign products quality is
the mediator in the given relationship stated in the
hypothesis.
Conclusion and Marketing
Implementations
The results of the research have demonstrated that country of
origin image does carry a significant positive effect on brand
image when it comes to Bangladeshi consumers'intention of
buying foreign products. Therefore, it is advised that market-
ers incorporate and emphasize the favorable match between
country of origin image and brand image in the various mar-
keting activities undertaken. However, in the event a certain
brand is affiliated with a less favorable image then it would
be a good decision for marketers to concentrate on other
product attributes when advertising as well as promoting the
products. In addition, another factor that carries a favorable
effect on Bangladeshi consumers' intention of buying for-
eign products is brand image. Henceforth, to sell their prod-
ucts in this particular market, it is advised that marketers
should work toward creating favorable images of their
brands. Under such circumstances, it has been mentioned by
Belch and Belch (2012) that one of the most popular means
of improving brand image is through image advertising. At
the same time, the findings have also unveiled that
Bangladeshi consumers pay much attention to the quality of
foreign products. In the future, initiatives must be taken by
marketers for informing the consumers about the superior
quality of their products through advertisements.
The results of the study have also indicated that ethnocen-
trism is unfavorably associated with foreign product quality
when it comes to Bangladeshi consumers' intention of buy-
ing imported products. Cateora and Graham (2007) have
advised that "localisation" is one of the most common ways
that can be undertaken by marketers to combat the negative
effect of ethnocentrism. Therefore, marketers must try to
give local appeal to the foreign products by associating them
with local celebrities in advertisements, as well as creating
joint ventures with local firms.
Finally, the findings have shown that religiosity also car-
ries a negative effect on intention of purchasing foreign
products. Therefore, to remain successful in the Bangladeshi
market, it is vital for marketers to take into consideration and
be thoughtful toward consumers' religious beliefs when
developing their marketing strategies and activities.
From a managerial perspective, this indicates that it is
vital for marketers to tailor different strategies for consumers
from different countries. This will assist marketers in craft-
ing meaningful marketing strategies that will enable them to
appropriately position as well as sell foreign products, par-
ticularly in the Bangladeshi market. Besides, in the context
of Bangladesh, it is also recommended that marketers should
create favorable images of their brands in the minds of the
consumers to augment the impact on their intention of pur-
chasing foreign products. Thus, in their marketing programs

marketers must give special attention toward informing con-
sumers about the superior quality of their products.
Limitations and Future Research
The main limitation of this study is that it strictly concen-
trates on Bangladeshi consumers; therefore, its findings can-
not be generalized to consumers from other countries. Hence,
it is highly recommended that in the future the generalizabil-
ity of the results of the current study is tested by studying the
proposed model in the setting of a new country where it has
not been studied yet and with a larger sample size. Besides,
the current study has studied consumers' intention of pur-
chasing foreign products in general; it did not focus on any
particular category of products. In the future, researchers can
study this phenomenon by taking into account specific prod-
uct category. Moreover, as the proposed model of the current
research stops at purchase intention, the researcher greatly
encourages future researchers to extend the proposed frame-
work by adding actual purchase behavior to the framework,
along with other new mediating and moderating variables.
