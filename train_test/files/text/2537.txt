The implementation of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act and shrinking federal, state,
and local budgets are among the greatest forces
changing the local public health system. In response
to lower budgets and an increase in insured individu-
als, some local health departments (LHDs) are explor-
ing ways to be reimbursed for their services by billing
third-party payers (public insurance providers such as
Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurers) for ser-
vices provided by LHD clinics.
Some LHDs have already successfully billed third-
party payers. All LHDs in Oregon have been
billing insured clients for immunizations through the
Oregon Immunization Project since 2003 to gener-
ate revenue to sustain immunization programming.1
LHDs billed third-party payers for vaccine adminis-
tration during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.2
The National Profile of Local Health Departments (Pro-
file) survey shows that 88% of LHDs in 2010 and
90% in 2013 reported revenue from clinical services.3
In response to the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention developed the Billables Project in 2009 to help
LHDs bill third-party payers to offset the rising cost of
immunizations.4
Data on the current billing landscape at LHDs
are limited. In response, the National Association of
County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) conducted
the 2014 Forces of Change survey to assess billing at
LHDs.

 Study Overview
NACCHO distributed the 2014 Forces of Change sur-
vey to a statistically representative sample of 957 LHDs
in the United States from January to February 2014
(n = 648; 68% response rate). To supplement the Forces
of Change data and collect more in-depth information
on LHD billing practices, NACCHO also conducted
key informant interviews with survey respondents in
May and June 2014 (n = 10). LHDs interviewed were
at various levels of billing capacity, from LHDs that do
not bill at all to large LHDs with well-developed billing
programs.
 Billing at LHDs
Findings show that most LHDs bill for at least some of
the clinical services they provide. Sixty percent bill pri-
vate and public insurers (Medicaid, Medicare, or both),
21% bill only public insurers, and 4% bill only private
insurers. Fourteen percent of LHDs reported that they
do not bill for clinical services.
As previous research has shown, LHDs bill third-
party payers in part to generate revenue.1,4 Forces of
Change key informants repeatedly discussed that reim-
bursements obtained through billing was an important
factor sustaining public health services to community

members. One respondent stated, " . . . There are [staff]
that rely on third-party for their salary and benefits
and so forth, so [billing allows us] to expand and get
qualified folks to be able to provide those services . . . ."
Another reported, "It helps to offset . . . some of our
costs. We don't receive near what it costs to run all our
programs."
In addition, some LHDs indicated that billing third-
party payers was important to demonstrate steward-
ship to elected officials:
So we need to be able to describe what we do, we need
to be able to describe what it costs to do what we do,
and we need to be able to show that we are recovering
every bit of money that we possibly can before we lean
on tax payer dollars.
LHDs were most likely to bill for family planning,
immunization, and home health; few LHDs billed for
tobacco cessation programs (Table 1). Across all service
areas asked, LHDs were most likely to bill both public
and private insurers.
In interviews, LHDs described that they attempt to
bill for all reimbursable services they provide. How-
ever, some also indicated that as a public health orga-
nization their mission is to provide services that might
not be available elsewhere in the community. For in-
stance, one informant reported:
I don't know that there are a lot of other of our direct
services that really lend themselves to billing. Because
by-in-large if it's something that insurance will cover
and it's available in the broader community, we're
probably not going to be heavily invested in it.
This finding is consistent with other literature that
shows that LHDs most often provide services to
vulnerable populations or when no alternative health
care provider is available in their communities.5
 Engagement to Increase Third-Party Billing
While some literature reports that LHDs have reduced
their clinical services over time,5 Forces of Change
findings show that LHDs are interested in increasing
billing to third-party payers. For instance, one infor-
mant stated, "We can always do better. I wouldn't say
that we're at 100 percent of where I would like to be."
Another put it simply: "If we could bill more, we would
bill more."
Survey results show similar findings. More than 80%
of LHDs were planning to increase billing to third-party
payers (76.9%) or planned to establish billing with
third-party payers (4.3%) (Table 2). LHDs that served
larger populations were more likely to plan to establish
billing with third-party payers than LHDs that served
smaller populations.
Even among LHDs that are not yet billing third-
party payers, key informants indicated they realize it is
important for them to start billing to maintain their pro-
grams: "We're definitely going to have to start billing, I
mean there is no way around it if we want to keep our
vaccine program going, if we want to have patients at
all we're going to have to start billing."
 Implications
Forces of Change findings show that a large major-
ity of LHDs bill for some clinical services and most
report interest in increasing third-party billing. This

increase in billing is fueled by the expanding pool
of insured patients, dwindling revenues from other
sources, and grant requirements for billing. At the
same time, LHDs are being encouraged to move away
from clinical care and toward population-based pre-
vention. The Institute of Medicine released a report
that emphasizes that population-based services, rather
than clinical care, have a larger impact on the public's
health.6 The shift away from clinical care and toward
population-based services has been a national trend
for decades. For example, NACCHO's Profile surveys
show that the percentage of LHDs providing primary
care decreased from 30% in 1993 to 11% in 2013; other
services showing big declines are prenatal care (54%
in 1993, 27% in 2013) and home health care (45% in
1993, 21% in 2013).7,8 However, some LHDs (particu-
larly in the South) continue to provide extensive clinical
services.
Sufficient availability of health care providers and
the profitably of clinical operations should be consid-
ered when determining whether to continue to pro-
vide clinical services. The availability of health care
services for low-income individuals, including those
covered by Medicaid, increased in many communi-
ties as community-based provider programs expanded.
However, some communities continue to rely on LHDs
as safety net providers, some individuals will remain
uninsured, and some will continue to seek care at LHDs
for various other reasons (eg, confidentiality, high co-
pays, or deductibles). In addition, clinical services can
generate revenue if LHDs provide them efficiently and
collect sufficient reimbursement from third-party pay-
ers. In these cases, clinical services are not competing
for tax dollars used to fund other services. As the health
care landscape evolves, LHDs need to carefully evalu-
ate the financial performance of their clinical operations
regularly to make informed decisions about whether to
continue, change, or eliminate services.
Both reducing clinical services and increasing billing
can change the relationship between LHDs and the
community they serve. For some LHDs, clinical ser-
vices such as immunizations have been an important
way for LHDs to be visible in their communities. When
LHDs discontinue these services, they must look for
new ways to demonstrate their value.
Providing services without regard to insurance sta-
tus is a long tradition at many LHDs, so shifting to
billing for services is a major cultural change for both
patients and LHD staff. However, for some LHDs, it is
a required change. One Forces of Change respondent
reported,
Some of the staff . . . don't like that we can't [provide
services] for free anymore. But you know, we have to
pay the bills and we have to be able to pay them a
salary. It's just really hard because a lot of the staff have
been here for a very very long time and we never had to
even question somebody about their income status or
their insurance status. And so it's kind of hard for us to
get accustomed [to] that too.
Despite the debate over clinical care, a large propor-
tion of LHDs are already billing third-party payers and
more are interested in increasing their billing capacity.
Researchers and practitioners have argued that LHDs
need additional training, technical assistance, peer sup-
port, and the exploration of a statewide unified billing
approach, among other resources to support billing
capacity.3 Forces of Change key informants supported
this claim: "If there was some way that someone could
figure this all out for us so that it wouldn't take us
months to actually determine what it is that we can bill
for."
The local billing landscape will continue to develop
over time. Data should be collected on which third-
party payers LHDs are billing, for which services and
through which systems, and how much reimbursement
is being collected compared with the costs of billing to
better prepare LHDs to adapt to the changing local
public health and health care landscape.
