Background: It is well known that European women are less physically active in their leisure time than European
men. Attempts to explain this gender difference often do not succeed in raising the problem above the individual
level. However, the size of the disadvantage for women varies considerably across countries, proving that leisure
time physical (in)activity takes place in a broader societal context and must also be approached as such. In this
sense, some authors have explained women's lack of leisure time physical activity in terms of gendered power
relations in society. Therefore, the present article postulates that over and above the individual effect of gender,
there is an additional impact of a society's gender-based (in)equality distribution. Methods: By means of the
2005 Eurobarometer survey (comprising 25 745 adults from 27 European countries), gender differences in leisure
time physical inactivity (LTPI) were analysed by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. National
gender-based (in)equality was measured by the Gender Empowerment Measure and the Gender Gap Index.
Results: Controlled for compositional effects, gender differences in LTPI varied as a function of gender-related
characteristics at the macro-level. In particular, in countries characterized by high levels of gender-based equality,
LTPI differences between men and women even disappeared. Conclusion: The findings underscore the need
to adopt a society-level approach and to incorporate socio-contextual factors in the study of gender disparities
in LTPI.

Introduction
Physical activity is an important public health issue and the
benefits of an active lifestyle in relation to well-being and
health have been strongly emphasized in recent years in Europe.
Physical inactivity is associated with increased risk of chronic
diseases and with other disease states, such as hypertension,
diabetes, osteoporosis, particular forms of cancer, obesity and even
psychological disorders. Therefore, the need to increase participation
in regular physical activity has been identified as one of the most
prevalent public health burdens of our times. In this regard, it is well
known that European women are less physically active in their
452 European Journal of Public Health
leisure time than European men.1­5 Attempts to explain this gender
difference generally emphasize women's different abilities, interests
and choices,6 and consequently do not succeed in raising the
problem above the level of the individual. However, the size of the
disadvantage for women varies considerably across countries.
Research shows that women residing in Southern countries
(Portugal, Greece, Italy) have the greatest deficit while the levels of
female participation in Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Finland,
Denmark) and the Netherlands are equal to or higher than those
of men.7­9 In addition, in most countries men are more likely to be
members of associations, whereas women's participation is more
flexible and market oriented. However, there remain considerable
cross-national differences.10 These differences prove that leisure time
physical (in)activity is a thoroughly social phenomenon, which takes
place, and finds its meaning for individuals within a broader societal
context4 and must consequently also be approached as such.
Therefore, recently, some authors11­13 have explicitly recognized
the role of gender- and family-related social policy as a source of
both ideological and practical influence on the way gender relations
are played out in the context of leisure. They have explained
women's lack of leisure time physical activity in terms of the
reality of their everyday lives, and gendered power relations in
society in particular. Lifestyle and leisure are thus constrained by
the lack of equal economic and political power between men and
women. Unfortunately, none of the existing studies on
cross-national variation in gender differences in leisure time
physical (in)activity7­9 examine the role of this factor in
preventing or reducing women's opportunities for participation in
leisure time physical activities. The present article aims to address
this gap and postulates that over and above the individual effect of
gender, there might be an additional impact of a society's
gender-based (in)equality distribution. Gender differences in
leisure time physical (in)activity are thus seen to arise out of
societal structures. Rather than viewing gender differences as fixed,
our question becomes: under what conditions are gender differences
in leisure time physical (in)activity large, and under what conditions
small? The conditions highlighted in this article are those facilitating
equal distribution of power and life opportunities for men and
women in different domains, including economic participation,
political empowerment, educational attainment and health and
well-being.
Moreover, an additional interpretation to be considered is that
previous reports on cross-national gender differences in leisure
time physical (in)activity might reflect a so called `compositional
effect',14 i.e. when cross-national variation is in fact attributable to
differences in group composition (the characteristics of the individ-
uals of which the groups are comprised). Such compositional effects
could erroneously lead to conclusions about contextual variation in
gender differences, when in fact the differences are due to
individual-level factors in several life domains, such as age, marital
status, educational attainment, urbanizational level and
employment, all of which have known effects on leisure time
physical inactivity (LTPI).5,15­18 Unfortunately, previous studies
have not ruled out such factors as likely explanations for the vari-
ability of gender differences. Consequently, the contextual (`the
difference a place makes') and the compositional (`what's in a
place') are often confounded.19
The present study examines both compositional and contextual
sources of cross-national variation of gender differences in LTPI
among European adults, using data from the 2005 Eurobarometer
survey. The article is structured according to three main objectives.
The first is to address the amount of gender differences in LTPI
across countries. The second is to examine the compositional
effects of individual-level factors on cross-national variation in
gender differences in LTPI. The third is to present relationships
between macro-level factors [gender-based (in)equality] and
gender disparities in LTPI.
Methods
Sample
Eurobarometer 64.3 (2005) is one of the most recent available
Eurobarometer surveys in which LTPI was assessed in all 27
European Member States. A multistage random sample design was
used and to ensure national representative samples,
post-stratification weights were applied in each country according
to demographic factors (gender, age and town size) using the most
recent census data.20 Data on individuals aged !18 years were
selected (N = 25 745), yielding at least 473 (Cyprus) and at most
1512 (Germany) conducted interviews in each country (table 1).
Measurement
Individual-level factors
The dependent variable in the analysis, LTPI, was assessed by means
of the question: `In the last 7 days, how much physical activity did
you get from recreation, sport and leisure time activities?' Answer
categories are divided between a lot (11.25%), some (25.69%), little
(23.49%) and none (39.56%). For analytical purposes, a dichotom-
ous outcome was created, with respondents answering `none'
defined as physically inactive in their leisure time, all others as
active [we have performed some exploratory sensitivity analyses
with a different operationalization of the outcome variable, i.e.
with both respondents answering `none' and `little' as physically
inactive in their leisure time, and the others as active (see also
previous research9). More specifically, we have re-analysed all
models, and although the coefficients were different, the results
were generally robust against the change in operationalization
implying that the main conclusions about macro-level influences

Study of gender disparities in LTPI 453
of gender (in)equality were upheld with a slightly different
dichotomization of the outcome variable].
The independent variables age, marital status, educational attain-
ment, urbanizational level and employment were introduced into
the equations to control for cross-national differences in the com-
position of LTPI-determining characteristics.
Macro-level factors
Two international composite measures of gender-based (in)equality
were introduced: the United Nations Development Programme's
Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and the World Economic
Forum's Gender Gap Index (GGI) (both measured in 2005). The
GEM captures gender differences in life opportunities in three areas:
(i) economic participation, measured by women's and men's
percentage shares of positions as legislators, senior officials and
managers; and by women's and men's percentage shares of profes-
sional and technical positions; (ii) political participation, measured
by women's and men's percentage shares in parliamentary seats; and
(iii) power over economic resources, measured by women's and
men's estimated earned income (PPP US$).
The GGI complements and expands on the GEM in that it
combines quantitative data sets with qualitative measures from the
Executive Opinion Survey of the World Economic Forum, a survey
of 9000 business leaders in 104 countries. The GGI focuses on five
domains: (i) economic participation, measured by male and female
unemployment levels, levels of economic activity and remuneration
for equal work; (ii) economic opportunity, measured by duration of
maternity leave, number of women in managerial positions, avail-
ability of government-provided childcare, wage inequalities between
men and women; (iii) political empowerment, measured by the
number of female ministers, share of seats in parliament, women
holding senior legislative and managerial positions, number of years
a female has been head of the state; (iv) educational attainment,
measured by literacy rates, enrolment rates for primary, secondary
and tertiary education, average years of schooling; and (v) health
and well-being, measured by effectiveness of governments' efforts to
reduce poverty and inequality, adolescent fertility rate, percentage of
births attended by skilled health staff and maternal and infant
mortality rates.
For technical details on the GEM, see http://hdr.undp.org/en/
media/HDR_20072008_Tech_Note_1.pdf. For the GGI.21 For both
measures, higher scores reflect higher levels of gender-based equality.
Statistical analysis
In the present article, the following questions are raised:
(i) nationally, how is gender related to LTPI?
(ii) having taken account of individual, compositional character-
istics, is there still cross-national variation in gender
disparities? and
(iii) how do country-level characteristics measuring gender-based
(in)equality account for the gender disparities in LTPI
between countries?
Unfortunately, most existing methodologies are problematic in
the manner in which contextual factors are implemented. The
more recent multilevel methodologies, however, provide a compre-
hensive framework to empirically address the key contextual consid-
erations of our research question5,14. By performing a multilevel
analysis, the clustered structure (individuals at level-1 and
countries at level-2) is taken into account and accurate estimations
of individual standard errors are obtained. Moreover, by explicitly
maintaining countries as a contextual level, it is reasoned that
important processes of social, political and/or economic nature
operating at this level might have a bearing on gender differentials
in LTPI.
A three-step sequential modelling strategy is adopted with
complexity being increased in every successive model. The focus of
each of the models is described below.
Unconditional or null model
Before estimating the individual-level multilevel models, it is
appropriate to begin by estimating a model with no predictors at
either level to test whether significant variation in LTPI exists across
countries (and consequently multilevel modelling is appropriate).
Moreover, in order to understand how much of the overall
variance in LTPI is attributable to either the individual or the
country level, it is useful to calculate the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC), [The intraclass correlation coefficient for linear
multilevel models is obtained by the following formula:
 ¼ ð00=00 þ 2Þ where 2 is the individual-level variance.
However, in non-linear models, such as our Bernoulli model, this
formula is less useful because the individual-level variance
is heteroscedastic.22 Snijders and Bosker23 describe an alternative
definition of the ICC for non-linear models as follows:
 ¼ ð00=00 þ 2=3Þ. This definition treats the dependent variable
as an underlying latent continuous variable following a logistic dis-
tribution of which the variance is 2=3], which measures the
proportion of the variance of the dependent variable that exists
between countries.
Individual-level model controlling for
compositional effects
Cross-national variation in gender differences could occur as a result
of known individual risk factors for gender differences in LTPI. To
test for such compositional effects, gender differences are adjusted
for age, marital status, educational attainment, urbanizational level
and employment. If the pattern of variation in gender differences
reflects a compositional effect related to (one of) these factors, we
would expect a reduction in the variation after controlling for these
individual-level factors. Both the intercept and the gender effect have
been allowed to vary across countries (i.e. to be random), while the
effects of all other variables are constrained to be the same across
countries (i.e. to be fixed).
Cross-level model
To examine the impact of national-level gender-based (in)equality
characteristics, a series of cross-level interaction models are tested.
For presentation purposes, countries are grouped in low, medium
and high groups based on the tertile scores of the relevant macro-
level indicators. To test whether significant cross-level interactions
exist, interaction terms between gender and the country subgroups
are computed separately for each of the gender-based (in)equality
measures and tested against the main effect model.
Since the response variable has two possible outcomes, logistic
multilevel (Bernoulli) models based on a logit-link function are
used. Models were fitted using the hierarchical linear modelling
(HLM) 6.3 software.24 The probability of LTPI occurrence is
estimated by calculation of multivariate odds ratio.
Before analysing gender-based inequality in LTPI in a multilevel
framework, the total LTPI percentages for each country, those for
men and women separately, and women's LTPI rate as percentage of
men's were computed. In addition, the gender differences in LTPI
were examined using the 2 measure in SPSS 17.0. The results of
these analyses are presented in table 1.
Results
LTPI differences across countries
The countries in table 1 are ranked according to their total LTPI
values, with Portugal and Romania as the most inactive nations:
454 European Journal of Public Health
around six out of 10 adult citizens are physically inactive in their
leisure time. Finland is the least inactive country with only less than
two out of 10 Finns aged !18 years reporting being totally inactive
in their leisure time. In general, LTPI seem to increase when moving
from the north to the south in Europe, and East Europeans generally
seem to have higher scores than West Europeans (with Lithuania,
Slovenia and to a lesser degree Latvia as exceptions). Moreover, for
23 of the countries, women have higher LTPI prevalences than men.
This gender gap is, however, only significant (at P 0.05) in 15 of
these countries. The size of the gender differences varies considerably
across countries, being largest in Cyprus (19.50%). For four
countries in our sample (i.e. Sweden, Finland, The Netherlands
and Lithuania), men have higher LTPI scores than women.
However, this gender difference is significant in none of the
countries. For men, the lowest LTPI score is found in Austria
(20.00%) and Finland (20.40%), whereas women report the lowest
levels of LTPI in Finland (17.90%) and The Netherlands (21.90%).
The highest LTPI is found for both men and women in Romania and
Portugal.
Multilevel models
Unconditional or null model
The results of our unconditional model show that statistically sig-
nificant variance in LTPI exists at the country level (variance
component intercept = 0.238 with P 0.001), making it clear
that the multilevel nature of LTPI should not be ignored.
Moreover, the proportion of the variance in LTPI that exists
between countries is considerable: 6.75% [(100 Â 0.238/
(0.238+3.29)]. (The ICC after including individual-level variables
is:  ¼ ð0:170=0:170 þ 2=3Þ ¼ 0:049). As noted by other
authors,25 the individual level usually accounts for a great deal of
the variance when data are measured at the individual level.
Moreover, the variance found here is congruent with previous
studies into leisure time physical (in)activity in Europe,5 but may
well be an artefact of not taking into account key compositional
characteristics. This is corrected for in the model shown in table 2,
which represents a simple multilevel model where the level-2 gender
variation is estimated after allowing for, and conditional on, selected
individual, compositional effects.
Individual-level model: controlling for
compositional effects
Table 2 shows the odds ratios (ORs) of gender on LTPI before and
after adjustment for compositional effects (ORs of all fixed effects
available upon request from the authors). After allowing for
individual characteristics, a 2 test shows that significant variation
in gender differences in LTPI between countries remains even
though the amount of variation decreased a little from 0.034 to
0.033 (The ICC after including both individual-level variables and
the GEM is  ¼ ð0:109=0:109 þ 2=3Þ ¼ 0:032). This indicates, in
other words, that the variation in gender differences in LTPI cannot
be accounted for by individual confounders alone and hence
country-context matters.
Cross-level models
Before turning to the cross-level models, a model containing the
contextual variables in addition to the compositional variables was
estimated. Each of the contextual variables (included separately) was
significant at P 0.001. Moreover, an exploratory aggregate
bivariate analysis showed that women's LTPI rate as percentage of
men's was positively related to both the GEM (Spearman's  = 0.543
with P 0.001) and the GGI (Spearman  = 0.683 with P 0.001),
indicating that in countries characterized by more gender-based
equality, the LTPI rates of women tend to approach those of men.
Our multilevel analyses confirm that the ORs of gender on LTPI
vary across country subgroups (table 3). The coefficients for the
group of countries characterized by high levels of gender-based
equality differ significantly (at P 0.001) from those for the group
of countries characterized by low and medium gender-based
equality, respectively. In countries characterized by low or
medium gender-based equality, significant gender differences in
LTPI can be noticed, with European women reporting being
around 1.4 times more physically inactive in their leisure time
compared with men (with P 0.001). In countries characterized
by high levels of gender-based equality, differences between men
and women disappear.
Discussion
By studying samples from all European Union countries, the present
study showed that the magnitude of gender differences in LTPI
varies cross-nationally, a finding that is consistent with some
recent European studies on gender and leisure time physical
(in)activity.1­3,9. Compared with these studies, the major strength
of our analyses was that a more powerful statistical method
was used. Adopting multilevel methodologies gives a much
stronger basis for making judgements about cross-national variabil-
ity. Through controlling for potential confounders (age, marital
status, educational attainment, urbanizational level and
employment), it was found that the cross-national variation of
gender differences in LTPI was highly robust for compositional
effects. The key finding, however, was that gender differences in
LTPI varied as a function of gender-related characteristics at the
macro-level. In countries characterized by a high level of equal
opportunities between men and women in several life domains,
gender differences in LTPI seemed to be absent, net of all
individual-level effects. National gender-based (in)equality thus
seems to have implications for the way in which men and women
construct their individual (and household) lifestyles, and fundamen-
tally affects the broader context in which leisure time physical
(in)activity occurs. Our results show that especially countries with

Study of gender disparities in LTPI 455
gender-empowering social policies constitute a social context that
has positive consequences for gender disparities in LTPI. Removing
inequality between men's and women's participation in leisure time
activities will therefore require far more than simply European-wide
mass media campaigns aimed at convincing women to become
physically active in their leisure time. Instead of such individually
oriented approach, public health policy should adopt a society-level
perspective in addressing gender disparities in LTPI. In most
countries, women still bear the major responsibilities for
household duties and childcare while men bear the major responsi-
bility for generating income. In the absence of radical changes in
gender roles within the family, the aim of reducing inequality
between men and women may best be served by facilitating
parental (female) employment by reducing the conflicting
demands of paid work and childcare while at the same time
restructuring the organization of work to reduce the time burden,
on women in particular. Evidently, a more nuanced and detailed
understanding is needed of the implications of countries' social
policies aimed at narrowing unequal opportunities in several life
domains between men and women.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous study on leisure time
physical (in)activity has looked at gender disparities from a
multilevel perspective. Despite this major strength, however, we
should also note some limitations.
First, the external validity of the findings might be difficult to
ascertain. Although intentionally two different macro-level
indicators of gender-based (in)equality were included (the GEM
and the GGI), their conceptual basis has been questioned by some
authors on the grounds that they are composites of conceptually
very different indicators.26 As a tool for testing hypotheses about
very specific mechanisms, these indicators might indeed be of
relatively limited heuristic value. Nevertheless, in the context of
this study, both indicators proved to be useful and support the
view that macro-level gender-related factors need to be taken into
account when studying gender differences in LTPI from a
cross-national perspective. And although exploratory analyses with
the subcomponents of the GEM and the GGI provided more or less
similar results, a natural next step for future studies would be to
incorporate particular national, political, economic, cultural,
education- and health-based factors as moderators of cross-national
gender differences in LTPI.
Secondly, cross-national comparison of data such as in the present
study might involve several sources of bias, among which method
bias. However, although inevitable variation in the data collection
exists (e.g. influence from the reviewer), the available documenta-
tion20 suggests no bias with respect to the countries' adherence to
the protocol.
Thirdly, although our analyses were controlled for urbanizational
level (a proxy indicator of within-country regional differences), from
an empirical perspective, it would be interesting to evaluate the
relative contribution of gender-based (in)equality at different
contextual levels such as regions or communities. Unfortunately,
although extensions of the debate fit perfectly within our
multilevel framework, regional data on this subject are not available.
Fourthly, our study relies on cross-sectional data so that the im-
plications of change over time could not be assessed. In this regard,
longitudinal studies might be interesting to both confirm and extend
our cross-sectional findings.
Fifthly, although the Eurobarometer data were the best available,
the self-reported single-question registration of leisure time physical
(in)activity might under- or overestimate real levels and might vary
across subgroups. Moreover, there might have been some variation
between countries in how respondents understood what was covered
by `physical activity from recreation, sport and leisure time activities'
(other research27 provides a more in-depth discussion on this
problem of `equivalence of meaning'). In addition, with a
reference period of 7 days, weather influences might also give
some bias to the results. Unfortunately, objective or multi-item
leisure time physical (in)activity data are not available in all
European countries, or at least not in sufficient detail for
cross-national comparison. In addition, our data are restricted to
physical (in)activity in leisure time, and any inferences pertain only
to this form of activity. Consequently, the mentioned effects might
be contradictory. For example, a factor hampering leisure time
physical activity at the cultural level might at the same time
increase the propensity to become physically active in other
settings such as during gardening or household work. Research
from 20044 has shown that high percentages of leisure time
physical activity go hand in hand with relatively low levels of
physical activity beyond the leisure sphere. According to this
study, Scandinavians, for instance, seem to be involved in leisure
time physical activities to a large extent while (or possibly because)
they are comparatively inactive at work, in and around the house or
when moving from place to place. However, results from a 2007
European study27 did not confirm these `compensation
mechanisms'. What is certain, is that demographics (i.e. an
increase in elderly citizens) and many cultural drivers (i.e. a
decrease in activity derived through housework and self-powered
transport; a declining trend for physically demanding jobs) are
pushing us towards a more sedentary rather than a more active
European Union. However, outside of physical activity in the
leisure time, the opportunities to promote other types of physical
activities are rather limited. It is difficult to envisage public inter-
vention policies aimed specifically at promoting gardening or
do-it-yourself tasks. Moreover, apart from using the stairs instead
of the elevator, or from jogging during lunch time, it sounds rather
ridiculous to formulate government recommendations aimed at
increasing the physical burden of jobs. Therefore, we suggest the
important contribution of physical leisure time activities to health
(among which the prevention or control of overweight and obesity)
primarily through the extent to which it contributes towards
increasing physical activity, although there is also evidence to
suggest that the social engagement aspects of leisure time physical
activity are beneficial in their own right.28
Key points
 Attempts to explain gender differences in LTPI often do not
succeed in raising the problem above the level of the
individual. However, the cross-national differences found
prove that LTPI is a social phenomenon that should also
be approached as such.
 Compared with previous studies, the major strength of our
analyses was that a more powerful statistical method was
used. Adopting multilevel methodologies gives a much
stronger basis for making judgements about cross-national
variability. It was found that the cross-national variation of
gender differences in LTPI was highly robust for compos-
itional effects.
 Our study shows that national gender-based (in)equality has
implications for the way in which men and women construct
their individual (and household) lifestyle, and fundamen-
tally affects the broader context in which leisure time
physical activity occurs, or does not occur. Especially
countries with gender-empowering social policies
constitute a social context that has positive consequences
for gender disparities in LTPI.
 Removing inequality between men's and women's participa-
tion in leisure time activities will thus require far more than
simply European-wide mass media campaigns aimed at
convincing women to become physically active in their
leisure time. Instead of such individually oriented
approach, public health policy should adopt a society-level
perspective in addressing gender disparities.
