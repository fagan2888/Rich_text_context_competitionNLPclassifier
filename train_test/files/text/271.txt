Estimation of AIDS adult mortality by verbal autopsy in
rural Malawi
Henry V. Doctora and Alexander A. Weinrebb
Objective: To estimate AIDS-related adult mortality using verbal autopsies (VA) in a
rural sub-Saharan African setting with high HIV prevalence.
Design: VA data were collected from relatives and neighbors that described the
circumstances leading to death for 92 adults in three rural areas of Malawi. These
adults were initially interviewed in 1998 as part of a longitudinal social survey of a
sample of 1554 women and 1126 men, and their deaths occurred between then and a
3-year follow-up interview in 2001.
Methods: AIDS-related deaths were identified using a standard World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) algorithm and this observed number of deaths was compared with the
expected number. The expected number is derived from a comparison of adult
mortality in this sample with the pre-AIDS mortality levels measured in the 1987
Malawi census, giving an `excess mortality factor' that can be considered to be AIDS
related. It was calculated that 74.9% of observed deaths in 1998­2001 would be from
AIDS.
Results: According to the WHO algorithm, 75.5% of the VA deaths could be
categorized as AIDS deaths. The gender-specific figures were 75.1% for females and
76.3% for males.
Conclusions: Results are consistent with those found in studies conducted in other
areas of sub-Saharan Africa at earlier stages in the epidemic. They confirm that VA
data can be used to estimate with a reasonable degree of confidence the distribution
of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related deaths in the aggregate, even in a rural population
with relatively low levels of education. & 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

Introduction
An increasingly common methodological response to
the lack of `cause of death' data for adults in sub-
Saharan Africa ­ itself a product of the general absence
of health facilities and the imperfect coverage of vital
registration systems [1­4] ­ is the use of data gleaned
from `verbal autopsy' (VA) forms [5­10]. This refers to
reports about a deceased individual's symptoms prior to
death collected by lay personnel from that individual's
close relatives or friends after death. These can then be
used to ascertain the likely cause of death.
Prior studies have shown that, notwithstanding con-
cerns about the impact of differential field and analytic
procedures, and of limitations in informants' know-
ledge or memory of the circumstances and symptoms
surrounding death, VA tends to provide reliable data
on the distribution of deaths by broad category [8]. In
particular, several studies have compared VA of adult
mortality with clinical reports or physician's assessments
in sub-Saharan Africa settings and have either found
that VA data in general tend to have very high levels of
specificity, with slightly lower scores on sensitivity
indices [11], or that they score high on both [10,12].

These findings are consistent with the fact that sensitiv-
ity and specificity vary across categories of disease (e.g.,
infectious, parasitic, non-communicable), by specific
disease, and across other causes of death (e.g., accident
and violence). The typical conclusion of such studies is
twofold. First, because VA leads to minimal misclassifi-
cation of cause of death, such data can be used to
identify the most important health problems in a
developing country setting. Second, VA may even
provide more dependable data on the overall distribu-
tion of cause of death than hospital data, since the latter
are unlikely to represent all deaths in the community.
It is worth noting that this overall reliability of VA data
in relation to adult mortality is not fully replicated in
VA data on child mortality. For example, several
studies have highlighted problems in distinguishing
deaths caused by acute lower respiratory infections
[13], malaria [7,14], and diarrhea [15].
Studies conducted in settings with moderate to high
levels of HIV prevalence suggest that the accuracy of
VA data extends to the diagnosis of AIDS-related
mortality in settings with high levels of AIDS. Indeed,
one South African study finds 100% sensitivity with
respect to AIDS [16]. This is in spite of concerns that
the secondary infections that are the proximate cause of
AIDS deaths may lead to a confusing array of verbal
reports about individuals' symptoms, or that the stigma
associated with AIDS or local informants' fear of it,
including local constructions in which its symptoms are
treated as the outcome of witchcraft, may have caused
them to understate what they think are AIDS-related
symptoms.
Generalizing from these studies remains problematic for
two reasons, however. First, there are issues of sample
selectivity. The study conducted in a setting with high
levels of AIDS, for example, used South African data
[10,16]; yet the South African population, even in its
poorest rural sector, is wealthier, healthier, and more
educated than equivalents elsewhere in sub-Saharan
Africa [17]. Similarly, a Zambian study used only urban
data [18], and a Tanzanian study had relatively low
HIV prevalence [19].
The second problem is related to temporal changes.
Most of these studies use data from the early 1990s (the
most recent is that of Boerma et al. [19], who used data
up to 1996). There is at least one reason that their
claims about the continued accuracy of VA reporting
in high-AIDS settings may no longer hold. Specifically,
increases in AIDS-related mortality, AIDS-related
public health discourses (by government and non-
governmental organization officials, in clinics, schools,
newspapers, churches, etc.), and AIDS-related conver-
sations between individuals (as indicated in studies of
conversational networks) have been ongoing in most
areas of east and southern Africa since the mid-1990s.
The present study uses data from one such study and
the wider data collected in the study have indicated the
high frequency of such conversations. A reasonable
cultural response to these increases would be for locals
to begin to appraise all mortality through a type of
AIDS prism. This would directly affect the accuracy of
VA reports since it suggests that, even if AIDS is not
mentioned as a cause of death, memories of a deceased
individual's symptoms would increasingly filter out
symptoms seen to be inconsistent with AIDS, leading
ultimately to an overestimate of AIDS in the VA data.
In short, there could be a danger that the depiction of
symptoms in VA reports will become less accurate as
AIDS increases to affect informants' appraisals of
mortality. This study examines whether this appears to
have occurred in a rural Malawian setting using data
from 1998 to 2001.
Methods
Research setting and data
Malawi is a relatively small sub-Saharan Africa country
in the east and southern African `AIDS-belt' with a
population of almost 11 million, 86% of whom reside
in rural areas [17]. It is a poor country, even by African
standards: its income per capita is US$190, in compari-
son to a sub-Saharan African mean of US$480 [17].
HIV/AIDS prevalence among adults is on the order of
16% but rising steadily [20]. As elsewhere in the region,
the government of Malawi and foreign donors consider
AIDS to present a crisis for Malawi [18]. AIDS in
Malawi is also an increasingly frequent focus of social
research, much of it directed at understanding the
micro-level effects on local cultural (i.e., interpretive)
and institutional arrangements in rural settings [21­26].
The mortality data used in this paper were collected as
part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change
Project (MDIC), an ongoing longitudinal project in-
volving a sample of almost 1700 ever-married women
of reproductive age (15­49) and their husbands (1500)
in three areas of Malawi. The overall aim of the MDIC
is to examine the role of social networks in changing
attitudes and behavior regarding family planning and
HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi. The project is based at the
University of Pennsylvania's Population Studies Center.

edu/Social_Networks/)
The questionnaire itself asked about symptoms asso-
ciated with the terminal illness, the relative timing and
duration of those symptoms, and the types of medical
treatment sought and received. Local interviewers were
employed, in accordance with standard methodological
recommendations [27,28]. The questionnaire used ap-
propriate local terminology (developed by HVD in

pre-fieldwork collaboration with the interviewers) and
data collection was supervised by HVD. It is assumed
that these methods facilitated the accurate communica-
tion and recording of symptoms. The possibility that an
interviewer effect could impact on these data, specifi-
cally that interviewers may have wittingly or un-
wittingly directed respondents or miscoded their
responses, thereby generating some false positives; this
was minimized by instituting thorough training. Its
effect was evaluated by estimating intracorrelation coef-
ficients (rho) for the 22 relevant VA variables. In seven
variables, rho was , 0.02, the standard threshold for a
significant interviewer effect [29]. In an additional
seven variables, it was in the modest 0.03­0.06 range,
and in the remainder of the variables it was > 0.07. All
seven AIDS-related variables (identified below) were in
the first two groups, suggesting that there was minimal
difference between interviewers in their measurement
of informants' responses insofar as these relate to AIDS
(a summary table is available from the authors).
Definition of a death from AIDS
Validation of VA data requires comparison of diagnoses
derived from the VA reports with some external
standard, usually medical doctors' assessments or clinical
diagnoses [30]. As such information was not available,
the external standard for the validation of apparent
AIDS cases was an aggregate one: the observed number
of deaths identified as `AIDS deaths' in the study was
compared with the expected number of such cases.
An `AIDS death' was defined as one where the
informants reported either that a death was caused
directly by AIDS or the existence of at least two
`major' signs and at least one `minor' sign of AIDS.
Such an identification of `AIDS deaths' lacks sensitivity
to the extent that certain illnesses will be missed. It also
lacks specificity to the extent that any non-HIV
tuberculosis or cancer will also fit the criteria. It was
assumed that these likely compensate for each other.
In past studies, few deaths have been identified in the
first way (e.g., 7% in one of the Tanzanian studies [31],
and only 3% in the Lusaka study [18]). The bulk of
AIDS diagnoses are, therefore, based on the more
inferential second method.
The specification of `major' and `minor' signs of AIDS
is based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
classification of AIDS-related symptoms [32]. It draws
on WHO guidelines for the provisional clinical case
definition for AIDS where diagnostic resources are
limited [33] and is used by the Malawi National AIDS
Control Program [34].
Although the lack of specific medical information
means that there are a number of conditions associated
with AIDS for which data are not available, including
those that are sufficient in themselves to diagnose AIDS
(generalized Kaposi's sarcoma or cryptococcal menin-
gitis) and minor signs such as recurrent herpes zoster,
oropharyngeal candidiasis, chronic herpes simples infec-
tion, and generalized lympadenopathy, the definition
used is consistent with ones used in previous studies
[31,33]. The major signs for which data was collected
are chronic diarrhea for more than 1 month, prolonged
fever (intermittent or constant) for more than 1 month,
and weight loss of more than 10% of body weight.
Since few of these rural informants (nor the deceased
themselves) would be likely to know about actual
changes in weight, the questionnaire asked about the
duration of weight loss rather than its extent, assuming
that weight loss for more than 1 month is associated
with at least 10% of body weight [32]. The minor signs
were prolonged cough, prolonged difficulty breathing,
prolonged pneumonia, and `rash' (considered to be an
indicator of generalized pruritic dermatitis if it occurred
in combination with two major signs).
The expected number of AIDS cases was calculated as
the `excess mortality factor' derived from a comparison
of adult mortality in this sample with the pre-AIDS
mortality levels, as measured in the 1987 Malawi census
data [35]. Mortality in this adult sample was greater
than mortality calculated from 1987 Malawian census
data for the same age groups by a factor of 3.0 (95%
confidence interval, 2.1­3.8) [35]. This increase is
consistent, it should be noted, with those reported in
neighboring Zimbabwe over the same period [36].
Because the census data covering 1978­1987 largely
predate the effects of AIDS-related mortality, and there
have been no reports of systematic increases in other
non-AIDS-related causes of mortality for adults over
the same period (i.e., not including secondary infec-
tions facilitated by AIDS), it can be reasonably assumed
that this increased mortality reflects the impact of
AIDS. Translating the 95% confidence interval into an
expected distribution of AIDS and non-AIDS mortality
indicated that 68.3­79.3% of all adult deaths would be
associated with AIDS (mean, 74.9%).
Results
Validity of data collection
Of the base sample of almost 1700 ever-married
women of reproductive age (15­49) and their husbands
(1500) in three areas of Malawi, 1554 women and
1126 men were interviewed in a first round of data
collection in 1998; 104 of these (54 women, 50 men)
were reported to have died by the second round in
2001. A good indicator that these reports were accurate
is the fact that a related research project drawing on
half the sample in 1999 reported 41 deaths and of these

all but one were also reported as deceased in 2001.
This single `resurrection' may have been related to the
project's gifting strategy: that is, to help to maintain the
goodwill of respondents across this and future rounds,
respondents were given small quantities of sugar and
soap.
In 92 of the 104 reported deaths, interviewers were
able to identify close relatives or neighbors and admin-
ister a VA questionnaire. In 71 of these (77%), the
informant was a close relative such as a spouse or
sibling; in the remaining 21, the informant was a
neighbor. There is no statistical difference in any aspect
of the VA report between these two sources. Nor is
there any statistically significant difference in socio-
demographic characteristics (as measured in 1998) be-
tween the 92 individuals with VA data and the 12
without.
AIDS-related deaths
Reported VA symptoms are shown in Table 1 (some
of the non-AIDS-related symptoms are grouped to-
gether). Consistent with studies mentioned above, a
few cases (10%) were directly reported as being caused
by AIDS. Larger percentages of the deceased were said
to have had at least one major or minor sign of AIDS.
For example, 54% had prolonged weight loss, 43% a
prolonged cough, and more than a quarter prolonged
fever or malaria, chronic diarrhea, or prolonged pneu-
monia. A further 23% had prolonged difficult/rapid
breathing and 10% a long-term rash.
Using the WHO algorithm, 75.5% of these cases
appear to be AIDS related. This value is almost exactly
in the middle of the confidence interval specified by
the comparison between observed and expected mor-
tality. There were no significant gender differences in
specific symptoms reported and this is reflected in the
lack of differences in the overall AIDS-related deaths
calculated for men and women: 75.1% of females and
76.3% of males are reported to have died of AIDS.
This is equivalent to a death rate of 0.042 for females
(20­49 years) and 0.050 for males (20­59 years).
Conclusion
In this study, AIDS adult mortality was estimated based
on VA. The study wished to assess whether the
increasing scale of the AIDS epidemic in rural areas of
sub-Saharan Africa, and its preeminence in local public
health discourses and in informal conversations about
health, might affect informants' appraisals of the causes
of adult mortality, thereby affecting the reliability of
VA as an assessment of AIDS-related mortality. The
VA data on deaths collected in 1998­2001 was, there-
fore, compared with a mortality factor calculated
independently to describe the increase in adult mortal-
ity in Malawi since the onset of AIDS. The comparison
shows that there is no apparent effect of high AIDS-
related mortality on the accuracy of the VA in the
aggregate. The mortality factor predicted that 75% of
the deaths would be AIDS related; 76% of the VA
deaths showed consistent signs of AIDS as identified by
the WHO criteria, despite the partial lack of sensitivity
and specificity in the definition of AIDS-related deaths.
This study, therefore, confirms studies conducted in
other areas of Africa, albeit in more educated popula-
tions and/or at earlier stages of the epidemic, in
asserting that VA remain a reliable data collection tool
for differentiating, at the aggregate level, between
AIDS and non-AIDS deaths.
