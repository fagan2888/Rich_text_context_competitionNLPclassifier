Does Government Oversight Improve
Access to Nursing Home Care? Longitudinal
Evidence From US Counties
Larry L. Howard, PhD1
Abstract
Gains in life expectancy around the world have increasingly placed pressure on governments to ensure that the elderly
receive assistance with activities of daily living. This research examines the impact of government oversight of Medicaid
payment policies on access to nursing home care services in the United States. Variation in price levels induced by a federal
policy shift in 1997 is used to identify the effect of Medicaid reimbursements on the number of nursing homes and beds
available. Court rulings prior to the policy change are used to categorically define a range of oversight treatments at the state
level. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate a significant decline in access to nursing home care services for individuals
living in states in which courts consistently ruled that Medicaid reimbursements did not meet the minimum standard implied
by federal law. The findings suggest that nursing home care services were made more accessible through a combination of
legislative and judicial oversight of Medicaid payment policies.

Introduction
Due to aging populations, societies around the world face the
challenge of providing assistance to people who are no lon-
ger able to care for themselves. Trends toward smaller fami-
lies and greater labor market participation in the United
States have coincided with an increasing reliance on publicly
funded providers of long-term care, as opposed to informal
care provided by family members.1 Over the next few
decades, the number of elderly individuals aged 65 and over
is expected to increase by 7 percentage points to approxi-
mately 20% of the population.2 Although recent evidence
suggests that there have been increases in disability-free life
expectancy among the elderly,3,4 any growth in the size of the
population utilizing nursing home care would place greater
pressure on governments and taxpayers to publicly fund
Medicaid programs covering the services.5 In fact, even if
there are no changes in demand for nursing home care, the
costs are likely to continue to rise. For instance, the number
of Medicaid recipients utilizing nursing home care remained
at about 1.6 million from 1999 to 2009, yet the total program
spending for these services increased by more than 50% to
US$48.6 billion.6 The Medicaid program now accounts for
over a third of total spending on long-term care services in
the United States. Part of the impact of an aging population
on nursing home care costs is directly related to the choices
state governments make in the design of Medicaid provider
reimbursement policies.
This article investigates whether Medicaid price levels
affect the accessibility of nursing home care. We measure
access to care using the total number of homes and beds
available in markets defined by county boundaries within
states. Typically, equilibrium market prices and quantities
are simultaneously determined, which makes it difficult to
identify causal effects of prices on supply-side outcomes. By
defining markets at the county level, we are able to take
advantage of changes during the 1980s and 1990s in the fed-
eralist structure of the administration of the Medicaid pro-
gram to evaluate how nursing home care providers responded
to plausibly exogenous changes in market prices determined
at the state government level. Currently, nursing home care
services are a federally mandated component of Medicaid's
long-term care benefits, but each state is free to set reim-
bursement prices at any level below the upper payment limits
based on Medicare policy.7 In previous years, this was not

2 INQUIRY
the case as the prices offered by states for nursing home care
were subject to federal government scrutiny and oversight.
The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 introduced a new
policy requiring states to pay nursing home care providers
rates that were "reasonable and adequate to meet the costs
that must be incurred by efficiently and economically oper-
ated facilities," and the policy was subsequently repealed
with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. (The policy is also
known as the Boren amendment after former Democratic
Senator David Boren, from Oklahoma, who sponsored it.)
However, in the interim years, there were a series of lawsuits
brought by nursing home care providers challenging whether
a state's reimbursement met the minimum standard implied
by federal law.8 The variation in court rulings is used to con-
struct a range of oversight treatments ranging from the great-
est oversight for states that only lost lawsuits challenging
Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices to the least
oversight for states experiencing no lawsuits challenging
their Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices during
this time. While initial government oversight initiatives are
often times in direct response to prevailing outcomes, the
repeal of this particular federal policy was applied equally
across all states at the same time and is therefore less likely
to be endogenously related with access to nursing home care
services in counties.
We use a difference-in-differences (DD) empirical frame-
work to estimate the effects of government oversight on
nursing home care access before and after the federal policy
change targeting Medicaid reimbursement prices. The results
indicate a significant decline in both the number of nursing
homes and nursing home beds in states that only lost lawsuits
challenging their Medicaid nursing home reimbursement
policies. For these 9 states, the repeal led to an average
decrease of approximately 1 nursing home and 100 nursing
home beds at the county level. Tests of the parallel trend
assumption underlying the DD empirical framework suggest
that the repeal of government oversight had a causal impact
on access to nursing home care. Additional results indicate
that there were not simultaneous changes in the fundamental
structure of health care markets of counties in this period.
Further evidence is presented that suggests that the observed
patterns of nursing home exit decisions were attributable to
declines in Medicaid reimbursement prices following the
repeal in 1997.
The article proceeds as follows. The "Background and
Related Literature" section provides a brief background of
the history of the federal policy change examined here and
discusses the related literature examining nursing home care
supply decisions. The "Estimation Strategy and Data" sec-
tion discusses the estimation strategy and data used for the
empirical analysis. The "Results" section presents the main
results and addresses the question of whether the estimates of
the effects of government oversight can be interpreted as
causal. Then, the next section presents evidence on the
mechanism of the government oversight impact in this con-
text. The last section concludes.
Background and Related Literature
Annual federal and state government expenditures for the
provision of nursing home care services through the Medicaid
program now exceed US$48 billion. Elderly recipients
account for nearly three-fourths of the total costs of nursing
home care, and nursing home care services comprise 15% of
the total Medicaid program spending.6 (Nursing home care
services are also commonly referred to as nursing facility
services. Elderly recipients are individuals aged 65 and older
and are also commonly referred to as aged beneficiaries.
Nursing home care costs account for about 5% of the total
non-elderly recipient costs.) There has been remarkable
growth in Medicaid spending on this particular type of health
care since the program's inception in 1966. Spending on
nursing home care services increased 11-fold during the
1970s and, over the next decade, it continued to increase and
more than doubled during this time. From 1990 through
2000, spending on nursing home care services grew by 175%
(for a summary of aggregate nursing home care expenditures
by payment source, see Table 15 at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/
NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf).
In response to the rapid growth of nursing home care costs
in the 1970s, the federal government introduced a new
Medicaid provider payment policy as a part of the Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1980. The change was intended to help
reduce costs by relaxing federal government oversight and
giving states more discretion in setting Medicaid reimburse-
ment prices for nursing home care.9 In particular, the new
policy required that states pay nursing home care providers
rates that were "reasonable and adequate to meet the costs
that must be incurred by efficiently and economically oper-
ated facilities." However, a policy shift that was originally
intended to reduce government oversight of Medicaid reim-
bursement prices eventually led to increases in government
oversight for a number of states. Miller8 identifies 84 law-
suits in 34 states brought by nursing home care providers
challenging whether a state's reimbursement met the mini-
mum standard implied by the federal policy between 1981
and 2001. In each of the cases, a final decision was reached
and a prevailing party was determined on the issues. Overall,
states prevailed in 46.4%, nursing homes prevailed in 38.1%,
and mixed court rulings occurred in 15.5% of the lawsuits.
We consider the lawsuits in which nursing homes prevailed
as an adverse outcome from a state's perspective because it
implies that Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing
home care would need to increase to comply with federal
policy. The subsequent repeal of the policy with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 suggests that Medicaid reimbursement
prices for nursing home care would decline in the states that
had only lost lawsuits as the primary legal basis for the
Howard 3
lawsuits challenging Medicaid nursing home care reimburse-
ment prices was eliminated.
Related Literature
There exists a large literature examining the determinants of
decisions of nursing home care providers in the United
States. It has been recognized that government reimburse-
ment policies for nursing home care directly influence the
profitability of the industry.10 In contrast to other common
types of health care, providers of nursing home care are able
to enter the market for relatively low costs. Start-up costs are
generally lower for nursing home care because the facilities
do not need to invest in specialized equipment and are able to
utilize low-skill labor to meet the health needs of patients.1
As a result of the rapid increase in nursing home care costs
for Medicaid recipients in the 1970s, "certificate-of need"
regulation was implemented at the state level to restrict entry
into the industry. (The National Health Planning and
Resources Development Act of 1974 first required state
approval. It was repealed in 1986, and all 5 states continue to
implement some form of regulation to limit.1) To enter or
expand, firms had to prove to state governments that a need
for additional supply of nursing home beds was evident in a
local market.11,12 In contrast, there are no barriers preventing
firms from exiting the nursing home care industry. The
majority of nursing home care providers are owned and oper-
ated by for-profit firms.13 Nursing homes typically serve a
mix of private paying and Medicaid patients, and the profits
of nursing homes that serve a greater share of Medicaid
patients would be more sensitive to changes in Medicaid
reimbursement rates. If nursing homes are limited in the
extent to which they can substitute private paying patients
for Medicaid patients, then exiting may be a profit-
maximizing decision in the face of lower Medicaid reimburse-
ments. The present study is the first to empirically examine the
decision of nursing home care providers to exit the industry.
Estimation Strategy and Data
We are interested in the relationship between Medicaid reim-
bursement prices and access to nursing home care, which
might be approximated as

mined by state governments, X

state characteristics, and u
ist
is the error term. The parameter
of interest is , which is the effect of Medicaid reimburse-
ment prices on overall access to nursing home care. Note that
the effect expressed in equation (1) is not at the county level,
but at the state level because decisions on Medicaid provider
reimbursement prices are applied equally to providers in all
counties within a state. A key impediment to obtaining an
unbiased estimate of  is that prices are not randomly
assigned to states and are likely to be endogenously deter-
mined with other unobserved state-level factors related with
access to nursing home care. For instance, states with higher
reimbursement prices may have greater demand for health
care services, more generous Medicaid eligibility criteria, or
higher health care costs. To address the endogeneity prob-
lem, we take advantage of the timing of a discrete change in
federal government policy concerning the oversight of
Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices. The variation
in reimbursement prices induced by the federal policy shift is
plausibly uncorrelated with unobserved state-level factors
related with access to nursing home care.
The challenge in estimating the effect of government
oversight of Medicaid reimbursement prices on access to
nursing home care is finding a control group that credibly
tracks how counties would have developed in the absence of
oversight. In this case, every state Medicaid program was
subject to the policy introduced with the Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1980. (Arizona did not begin covering
nursing home care services through Medicaid until 1988.) A
key ramification of the policy was a series of lawsuits
brought by nursing home care providers against states on the
grounds that reimbursement prices were inadequate. The
variation across states in lawsuit initiation and court rulings
for or against the plaintiff suggests a range of oversight treat-
ments. We categorically define treatment status based on
each of the four possible outcomes for states during the
period before the repeal of the policy with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997: states with no lawsuits, states that only
won lawsuits, states with mixed court rulings on lawsuits,
and states that only lost lawsuits. The latter treatment cate-
gory is arguably the case where government oversight had
the strongest impact on Medicaid reimbursement prices for
nursing home care because the courts ruled that prices were
inadequate under federal law. In our initial approach, we
focus on this case of government oversight, and use a DD
methodology to examine the effect of strong government
oversight on access to nursing home care. The first estimat-
ing equation is specified as

4 INQUIRY
in nursing home levels of counties located within states that
only lost lawsuits and counties located within states that had
no lawsuits, had only won lawsuits, or had mixed court rul-
ings. The key identifying assumption is that any relative
change in nursing home levels is due to the repeal of the
policy and, hence, the federal law underlying previous court
decisions. As changes in nursing home supply may also be
correlated with other time-varying demographic and eco-
nomic characteristics affecting demand for nursing home
care within counties and states, we further include a set of
additional controls to equation (2). At the county level, we
include fixed effects to control for all unobserved and
observed time-invariant factors influencing the availability
of and demand for nursing home care. Over time, changes in
the number of residents as well as their income and employ-
ment opportunities would be expected to affect demand for
Medicaid and health care services. We include income per
capita, the annual unemployment rate, and the size of the
population to control for shifts in demand for counties and
the states in which the counties are located. However, at the
state level, we are concerned with potential omitted variables
related to Medicaid policy choices affecting eligibility crite-
ria and benefit levels, which are expected to influence
demand for health care services, particularly nursing home
care. Additional explanatory variables for the population
structure include the population aged 14 or younger per cap-
ita, the population aged 65 and over per capita, and the
female population aged 15 to 44 per capita. These three seg-
ments of the population are primary targets of the Medicaid
program. To control for changes in Medicaid recipients of
nursing home care, we include the number of elderly
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients per capita, as
well as the number of blind-disabled SSI recipients per cap-
ita. SSI program eligibility implies eligibility for the
Medicaid program. Finally, we include the federal medical
assistance percentage (FMAP) to control for differences over
time in federal government financing incentives associated
with Medicaid matching grants to states. To the extent that
states'Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing home care
are determined by these factors, the additional controls will
help to remove any resulting bias from omitted variables.
Our second approach considers the possibility that the ref-
erence group of states in equation (2), which includes states
that had no lawsuits, states that had only won lawsuits, and
states that had mixed court rulings, may lead to an over- or
underestimate of strong government oversight on access to
nursing home care. For instance, every state could poten-
tially lower Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing
home care after the repeal of the policy because the legal
basis for lawsuits against states was eliminated. However,
states with previous lawsuits may respond differently to the
repeal as compared with states with no previous lawsuits
challenging their Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing
home care. Modeling the entire range of government over-
sight treatments would allow us to further investigate whether
the judiciary involvement in states that won lawsuits also
affected access to nursing home care. The estimating equa-

Equations (2) and (3) are estimated using ordinary least
squares (OLS), and standard errors are clustered at the state
level to allow for an arbitrary pattern of serial correlation in
the residual error terms of counties.
Semiparametric Censored Regression Model
The outcomes of interest in equations (2) and (3) are the
number of nursing homes and nursing home beds in a county,
and observations can have a limiting value of 0. Tobin14
developed a limited dependent variable (Tobit) model to
account for a concentration of observations at a limiting

Greene15 demonstrates that OLS estimates of  are biased

if X

been developed to consistently estimate parameters in Tobit
models; however, very few are amenable to the inclusion of
fixed effects. To evaluate the extent of the bias evident in OLS
estimates of  in equations (2) and (3), we apply the trimmed
least squares estimator developed by Honoré.16 A key advan-
tage of using this particular semiparametric estimator is that it
Howard 5
is unnecessary to assume a specific structure for the serial cor-
relation of the residual error terms of US counties.
Data
The study utilizes county- and state-level data from a number
of sources. A description of each source is provided here.
Our main empirical analysis is based on a 2-period panel of
3094 counties, which is approximately 98% of all US coun-
ties, between 1994 and 2000. (There are 15 counties from
Arizona that are not included in the sample because Arizona
did not begin covering nursing home care services through
Medicaid until 1988.) Sample means for the key variables
are reported in Table 1.
Outcomes measuring the number of nursing homes and
certified nursing home beds in counties are obtained from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Additional
county and state controls include the annual unemployment
rate from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, total personal
income from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and total
population from the US Census Bureau. The percentage of a
state's population that is female and between the ages of 15
and 44, the percentage of a state's population aged 14 or
younger, and the percentage of a state's population aged 65
or older are also reported by the US Census Bureau. Data
collected on SSI recipients from the US Social Security
Administration are used to construct per capita measures of
elderly SSI and blind-disabled SSI recipients in each state.
The FMAPs for each state are obtained from the Green Book.
Additional county-level outcomes include the total number
of active medical doctors and hospitals reported by the
American Medical Association and the American Hospital
Association, respectively.
Additional state-level data are utilized to examine changes
in state Medicaid spending on nursing home care services
relative to the number of recipients over the 1994-2000 time
period. Data on Medicaid spending on nursing home care are
obtained from CMS-64 Expense Reports that are collected
by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Data on
Medicaid nursing home care recipients come from the Health
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 2082 reports for fis-
cal year 1994-1998. As of fiscal year 1999, all states are
required to submit Medicaid expenditure and recipient infor-
mation via the Medicaid Statistical Information System
(MSIS).
Sample means are reported in Table 2.

Results
Main Results
Table 3 presents the OLS estimates of  in equation (2),
which measures the DD in nursing homes and nursing home
beds from 1994 to 2000. In column 1, the DD estimate of
-0.49 is significant at the 5% level and indicates that coun-
ties located within states with the strongest government
oversight experienced a decline in the number of nursing
homes after the repeal of the federal policy with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. In column 3, the point estimate of
-41.74 suggests a corresponding decline in the number of
certified nursing home beds available in these counties. Note
that access to nursing home care declined at the state level as
well; if the decrease in nursing homes and nursing home
beds in certain counties was completely offset by increases
in other counties within states, the DD estimate would equal
0. To assess the omitted variable bias, columns 2 and 4 pres-
ent the estimates with an extensive set of controls included,
and a downward bias is evident. The point estimate of 
increases in magnitude to -1.01 for nursing homes and
-77.04 for nursing home beds. The results indicate that the
repeal of the federal policy significantly reduced access to
nursing home care for residents of states that only lost law-
suits related to the policy, relative to residents in all other
states.
To assess the extent to which judiciary involvement in
states that won lawsuits also affected access to nursing
home care, Table 4 presents the OLS estimates of 
1
- 
3
in
equation (3). The key difference here is that the reference
group is now counties located in states with no prior experi-
ence with lawsuits related to the federal policy. Columns 1
and 3 show the DD estimates for nursing homes and nurs-
ing home beds without the controls for completeness, as we
expect bias related to omitted variables based on the previ-
ous results presented in Table 3. In column 2, the DD esti-
mate of -0.94 is significant at the 5% level and indicates
that counties located within states with the strongest gov-
ernment oversight experienced a decline in the number of
nursing homes after the federal policy repeal. In contrast,
the DD estimates of -0.07 for states that had only won law-
suits and 0.26 for states that had mixed court rulings are
statistically insignificant and much smaller in magnitude.
Furthermore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of joint
insignificance of 
2
and 
3
(P < .41). The results do not
indicate any significant differences in nursing home avail-
ability for states that won lawsuits, relative to states with no
lawsuits.
As a final step, we apply the trimmed least squares esti-
mator developed by Honoré16 to assess the sensitivity of our
results to censoring of the dependent variables at 0. Table 5
presents the DD estimates of government oversight on nurs-
ing homes and nursing home beds based on equations (2) and
(3), with and without control variables included. We focus
the discussion on columns 4 and 8 based on equation (3) with
controls because of the estimation issues previously dis-
cussed. In columns 4 and 8, the DD estimates of -1.10 for
nursing homes and -116.22 for nursing home beds are sig-
nificant at the 5% level and indicate that the censoring biased
OLS estimates toward 0. The DD estimates for states that
had only won lawsuits are larger compared with those
obtained with OLS, but remain statistically insignificant.
The DD estimate of 0.60 for nursing homes in states that had
mixed court rulings is now larger compared with the OLS
estimate and significant at the 5% level. It is not clear why
the repeal had a positive effect of nursing home availability
in these states; however, the DD estimate of 23.52 for nurs-
ing home beds is statistically insignificant. This suggests that
the repeal of the federal policy may have prompted a restruc-
turing of nursing home size, possibly to reduce costs in antic-
ipation of lower Medicaid reimbursement prices. However,
there was not a significant increase in the number of nursing
home beds available to residents as a result of the increase in
nursing homes.

Testing the Parallel Trend Assumption
To interpret the DD estimates presented here as causal, it is
crucial to establish whether nursing homes and nursing home
beds in counties were changing at the same overall rate
before the repeal of the federal policy with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. We test the parallel trend assumption by
examining changes in nursing home care availability between
1991 and 1994. Table 6 presents the results based on equa-
tions (2) and (3) for nursing homes and nursing home beds.
In columns 1 and 2, the point estimates of -0.82 and -1.85
for nursing homes are statistically insignificant, and suggest
that counties in states that had only lost lawsuits were expe-
riencing the same overall decline in nursing homes during

columns 3 and 4, the point estimates of -59.11 and -200.13

we fail to reject the null hypothesis of a parallel trend in nurs-
ing homes and nursing home beds before the federal policy
repeal.

An additional threat to interpreting the DD estimates pre-
sented here as causal is that there may have been changes in

were correlated with the changes in nursing home care avail-
ability that we find. For instance, nursing home residents fre-
quently have health care needs that can only be provided by
hospitals and doctors. Nursing homes may find that locating
in counties with a greater number of hospitals and doctors
increases demand for available beds. We examine DD in
doctors, hospitals, and long-term hospitals to assess the
extent to which there were possible contemporaneous
changes in health care markets that would confound our DD
estimates of government oversight on access to nursing
home care. Table 7 presents the results based on equations
(2) and (3) for doctors, hospitals, and long-term hospitals.
We do not find any evidence of significant changes in the
availability of other types of health care providers for coun-
ties located in states with the strongest government oversight
of Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing home care.
Mechanism of Government Oversight
Impact
A key assumption underlying the findings presented here is
that the federal policy shift in 1997 removed a binding bar-
rier preventing states from lowering nursing home reim-
bursement rates. In general, nursing homes are likely to
respond to lower reimbursements by reducing the number of
beds allocated to Medicaid patients. However, if nursing
homes are unable to substitute private paying patients for
less profitable Medicaid patients, then they may be forced to
exit the market when faced with lower Medicaid
reimbursements. Nyman11 demonstrates that reductions in
the supply of nursing home beds result in higher market
prices. This suggests that we would expect to observe higher
prices and fewer available beds if nursing homes exit the
industry due to low Medicaid reimbursements in the years
following the repeal.
Although direct information on the reimbursement rates
prevailing during this period is unavailable, we are able to
examine trends in average Medicaid spending on nursing
home care services per recipient. We estimate the following

where the dependent variable measures Medicaid spending

t
is a linear time trend. Spending per recipi-
ent depends on the Medicaid reimbursement prices offered to
nursing home care providers and on the number of beds allo-
cated to Medicaid patients. Prior to the repeal, we would
expect to observe below-average levels of Medicaid spend-
ing per recipient in states with the strongest government
oversight because courts had consistently ruled that the
Medicaid reimbursement prices did not meet the minimum
standard implied by federal law. As a result of adverse court
rulings, the trend in Medicaid spending per recipient should
be positive for states with the strongest government over-
sight. In contrast, we would expect to observe the opposite in
Table 6. Testing the Parallel Trend Assumption.

the years immediately following the policy repeal. A key
consequence of nursing homes exiting the industry is higher
prices and fewer beds available for Medicaid patients, both
of which would work to increase Medicaid spending per
recipient. This would suggest that states with the strongest
government oversight would have relatively higher levels of
Medicaid spending per recipient and a negative trend if states
take advantage of the reduction in government oversight fol-
lowing the federal policy shift in 1997.
Table 8 presents the results based on equation (6). Over
the period 1994-1997, we see that states with the strongest
government oversight of Medicaid reimbursement prices for
nursing home care had significantly lower levels of Medicaid
spending per recipient for nursing home care services, rela-
tive to states with no prior experience with lawsuits related to
the federal policy that was repealed in 1997. In contrast, the
results do not indicate any significant differences in nursing
home spending per recipient for states that won lawsuits or
experienced mixed court rulings, relative to states with no
lawsuits. No significant trends in spending per recipient were
evident during this time period; however, the estimated trend
for states with the strongest government is positive. Focusing
on the years immediately following the federal policy shift
reveals a different picture. Over the period 1998-2000, states
that had only lost lawsuits or experienced mixed rulings had
significantly higher levels of Medicaid spending per recipi-
ent for nursing home care services, relative to states with no
prior experience with lawsuits. Furthermore, the trend in
Medicaid spending per recipient for nursing home care ser-
vices among states that experienced lawsuits was signifi-
cantly lower compared with states with no prior experience
with lawsuits. The evidence suggests that in states with prior
lawsuits challenging their Medicaid nursing home care
reimbursement prices, Medicaid spending per recipient for
nursing home care services grew at a significantly slower
rate immediately following the policy repeal. This is consis-
tent with lower provider reimbursements, which would cre-
ate disincentives for providers to operate in these states.
Conclusions
This study presents the first empirical analysis of the role of
government oversight in determining the accessibility of
nursing home care in the United States. Changes during the
1980s and 1990s in the federalist structure of the administra-
tion of the Medicaid program created differences across
states in the extent to which the judiciary was involved in
regulating provider payment policies for nursing home care.
Overall, 9 states experienced lawsuits in which courts con-
sistently ruled that Medicaid reimbursement prices did not
meet the minimum standard implied by federal law that was
originally introduced with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act
of 1980 and then subsequently repealed with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. (The 9 states that had only lost lawsuits
were California, Florida, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.) Using a DD
empirical framework, we estimate that the repeal led to an
average decrease of approximately 1 nursing home and 100
nursing home beds at the county level between 1994 and
2000 for the states with the strongest government oversight.
The findings presented here suggest that government
oversight of Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices
benefited both Medicaid and private paying nursing home
patients. Nyman12,17 demonstrates that the quality of nursing
home care is lower in markets where there exists excess
Medicaid demand for available beds. The decline in the

number of nursing homes and beds following the federal
policy repeal is likely to create or increase excess Medicaid
demand and therefore result in a lower overall quality of care
for all patients. Furthermore, Nyman11 examined the rela-
tionship between market concentration and the price of nurs-
ing home care and found higher prices in markets with fewer
nursing homes. A key implication of higher private nursing
home care costs is an increase in Medicaid recipients, as
people unable to care for themselves "spend down" to obtain
Medicaid eligibility for nursing home care.
The policy issue of ensuring individual access to nursing
home care services is unlikely to become less important over
time. Recent federal government expansions in the scope of
eligibility for Medicaid through the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act18 will eventually test whether additional
government oversight is necessary to guarantee the availabil-
ity of health care services covered by the program. The bud-
getary pressure generated by increases in Medicaid recipients
will create strong incentives for states to lower provider
reimbursement prices to help control costs. Predicted changes
in the age structure of the US population will further exacer-
bate budgetary pressure arising from the Medicaid program,
and force state governments to make difficult decisions
involving tradeoffs between raising taxes and cutting other
public expenditures to cover the costs. Baicker19 demon-
strates that state governments respond to federally mandated
Medicaid spending by reducing spending on other welfare
programs. The implication is that giving more authority to
states in the design of federal-state welfare programs such as
Medicaid may work to shift the accessibility of health care
services from one low-income population to another. Our
findings suggest that government oversight of Medicaid
reimbursements, involving both the legislative and judiciary
branches of government, is one policy lever that works to
increase overall access to nursing home care services.
Whether judiciary mandates distort states'welfare budgets to
the same extent as legislative mandates remains an open
question.
