Introduction
Pregnancy is one of the physiological conditions that
requires lengthy and significant restructuring of many sys-
tems of an organism to properly maintain homeostasis.1,2
Therefore, studying changes in the functions of the cardio-
vascular system (CVS) during pregnancy and the factors
responsible for these changes, is an important medical chal-
lenge. These functional changes may result in an increased
loadonthecardiovascularsystemofawoman.3 Impairments
of the cardiovascular system during pregnancy may cause
preeclampsia4,5 and, thereby, lead to chronic intrauterine
hypoxia and placental failure.6
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and, in par-
ticular, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to
play an important regulatory role in the function of the
CVS. The enzyme hydrolyses angiotensin I into angioten-
sin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor.7 Several polymorphisms
of the ACE gene have been studied with respect to
the association with CVS functioning under normal and
diseased conditions.8­10 One of these polymorphisms is an
insertion-deletion (I/D) of the 287-bp Alu repetitive ele-
ment in intron 16 of the gene.11 The polymorphism does not
affect the protein structure but apparently influences
expression of this gene.
The insertion-deletion polymorphism
of the ACE gene is associated with
increased blood pressure in
women at the end of pregnancy

Abstract
Introduction: Malfunctioning of the cardiovascular system during pregnancy may be responsible for adverse effects on
the `mother-fetus' system. The cardiovascular system of a pregnant woman develops adaptation to the increased load.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to play an important role in the adaptation. The present study was
designed to investigate whether the insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with the level
of arterial blood pressure in women before and during pregnancy.
Materials and methods: The level of blood pressure was measured in 591 Russian women (Central Russia) before
and during (37­40 weeks term) pregnancy. The women were divided into three groups which were hypertensive, hypo-
tensive, and normotensive according to blood pressure level. Genotyping of the ACE I/D polymorphism was performed
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism assay.
Results: Women with genotype DD showed the highest blood pressure level both during and at the end of preg-
nancy (p<0.05). The highest frequencies of allele D and genotype DD were found in pregnant women in the hyper-
tensive group.
Conclusions: The deletion variant of the ACE gene is associated with high blood pressure level at the end of pregnancy.

Several studies reported that bloodACE levels in healthy
individuals with the DD genotype were twice as high as
those in the II homozygotes, with the heterozygotes having
an intermediate value.11­13 The studies reporting the asso-
ciation of the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene with the
blood pressure (BP) level in pregnant women are contradic-
tory. This prompts further research on the role of the I/D
polymorphism of ACE gene in the regulation of BP during
pregnancy.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
The study population included 591 unrelated women of
Russian descent living in Central Russia (Belgorod region).
The age of the women varied from 20­43 years (mean age
27.98±4.50 years). The study was approved by the Regional
Ethics Committee at Belgorod State University. All women
signed an informed consent form prior to the recruitment
for this study.
Clinical and laboratory examinations of women were
conducted at the Perinatal Center (Division of Pathological
Pregnancy) of the Belgorod Regional Clinical Hospital.
The criteria for inclusion in the study group were (a)
Russian nationality; (b) pregnancy at 37­40 weeks of ges-
tation; and () signed informed consent for the study.
Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal
failure, and those at a gestation <37 weeks and >40 weeks
were excluded from the study. A general outline is shown in
Figure 1. BP level was measured three times by experi-
enced obstetricians according to the American Heart
Association recommendations.14 The measurements were
done in the morning (between 0700­0900 hours) and even-
ing (between 1900­2100 hours). The data on BP level
before pregnancy were obtained from the medical records
of each woman. The mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg)
was calculated as follows:
MAP=(SBP+2DBP)/3 where SBP is systolic blood
pressure and DBP is diastolic blood pressure.15
All study participants were divided into three groups
depending on the BP level at the end of pregnancy. The
groups included normotensive women (SBP from 90­140
mm Hg and/or DBP from 60­90 mm Hg), hypotensive
women (SBP<90 mm Hg and/or DBP<60 mm Hg), and
hypertensive women (SBP>140 mm Hg and/or DBP>90
mm Hg).16
DNA extraction and genotyping
Venous blood (8­9 ml) was drawn from the ulnar vein of
each woman. Genomic DNA was isolated using the
method proposed Miller and et al.17 Genotyping of the
insertion-deletion polymorphism (rs4646994) of the ACE
gene was performed using a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP) assay according to the protocol described
elsewhere.18
Statistical analysis
Allele frequencies of the ACE gene polymorphism were
estimated by the gene counting method, and the chi-squire
test was used to identify significant departure from Hardy­
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The distribution of allele
and genotype frequencies between the study groups was
compared by the chi-squire test for 2×2 contingency tables.
The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the
Bonferroni correction (pcor
). The distribution of the quanti-
tative traits such as SBP, DBP, MAP and pulse pressure (the
pressure difference between the systolic and diastolic pres-
sures) before and at the end of pregnancy were analyzed by
the Shapiro-Wilk's test.19 Because the values of the quanti-
tative traits did not follow the normal distribution, median
(Me) and interquartile range (Q25­Q75) were used for their
description and intergroup comparisons were done using
the Mann-Whitney test.20 Linear regression analysis was
used to estimate the impact of age, weight, and ACE geno-
types on the BP parameters in women. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using STATISTICA for Windows v. 6.0
(StatSoft, USA).
Results
The biomedical and clinical characteristics of the study
women are shown in Table 1.As can be seen from Table 1, the
prevalence of hypertension among women before and at the
end of pregnancy was 10.3% and 51.7%, respectively. The
prevalence of hypotension dropped from 19.1% prior to preg-
nancy to 4.1% at the end of pregnancy. Moreover the values
of BP increased significantly in women to the end of preg-
nancy in comparison with women prior to pregnancy. Obesity
was found in 20.6% the study women. Moreover 15.1% of
women had excessive body weight, whereas 8.1% of women
had decreased body weight. The study group also comprised
7.8% of women who had other extragenital pathology.
The observed ACE genotype frequencies in the study par-
ticipants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency
of allele D in the entire group (n=591) was 0.533. Frequency
of genotypes II, ID, and DD were 19.97% (n=118), 53.47%
(n =316), and 26.56% (n =157), respectively, which is con-
sistent with data reported in other European populations.21 No
statistically significant differences in the distribution of the
ACE genotypes prior to pregnancy were observed between
the three study groups (Table 2).
Friedmans ANOVA test allowed us to reveal that the
BP parameters increased significantly by the end of preg-
nancy in comparison with those prior to pregnancy, with
Reshetnikov et al. 625
most increased BP level in carriers of genotype DD.
However, as can be seen from Table 2, the values of the
systolic and mean BP during pregnancy were the lowest in
women with the II genotype and the highest in women
with the DD genotype. At 37­40 weeks of gestation,
women with genotypes DD and ID had greater values of
SBP, DBP and average BP as compared to those with
genotype II. Furthermore, the frequency of allele D was
the highest in the group of women with hypertension at the
end of pregnancy (56.6%) followed by the subjects with
normotension (50.7%) and hypotension (35.0%) (the data
are shown in Figure 2). Accordingly, the largest number of
individuals with genotype DD and the lowest one with
genotype II were observed in the hypertensive women

(29.5% and 16.4%, p=0.01, pcor
=0.03), while the opposite
pattern of the genotype distribution was seen in the hypo-
tensive group (6.7% and 36.6%, p=0.02, pcor
=0.06) (Figure
3). None of the study groups (normotensive, hypotensive
or hypertensive women) showed statistically significant
differences in the parameters of BP between the carriers of
the ACE genotypes among women before and during a
pregnancy (Table 3).
Linear regression analysis observed the impact of cur-
rent age (t=2.9, p=0.004), weight (t=8.2, p<0.0001) and the
ACE polymorphism (t=­3.8, p=0.0002) on SBP at the end
of pregnancy (R2=15.33%). In addition, the DBP depended
(R2=10.9%) on the same factors such as current age (t=2.3,
p=0.02), weight (t=6.7, p<0.0001) and the ACE genotypes
(t=­3.5, p=0.0006). The impact of the same factors was
seen with respect to the pulse pressure of pregnant women.
Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that the I/D poly-
morphism of the ACE gene is associated with the level of
arterial BP at the later stage of pregnancy (37­40 weeks) in
women. Allele D confers higher BP, whereas allele I is
associated with lower BP. The observed association
between the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and level
of BP in women at the end of pregnancy is supported by the
data about the physiological role of this enzyme. It has been
recently reported that healthy individuals possessing the D
allele of the ACE gene had significantly higher levels of the
circulating enzyme in blood than those possessing the
homozygous II genotype, while the heterozygotes had the
intermediate levels.11­13 The ACE enzyme participates in
the synthesis of angiotensin II, which has a strong vasocon-
strictor effect.22 Therefore, individuals with the highly
expressed DD genotype have a higher vascular tone and BP
level.23 Furthermore, under normal conditions, concentra-
tion of the ACE in plasma of pregnant women constantly
increases until the third trimester. Notably, women with
genotype DD ACE have the maximum concentration of the
enzyme as compared to those with genotypes ID and II,11,12
and in turn, this results in higher BP at the end of
pregnancy.
Ample evidence exists about association of the I/D ACE
polymorphism with various cardiovascular disorders such
as essential hypertension,24,25 coronary artery disease,26,27
myocardial infarction,28 and myocardial hypertrophy.29 It
should be noted that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sys-
tem may be involved in the development of both insulin
resistance and gestational diabetes mellitus.30 The increased
levels of ACE in plasma accounted for by the DD geno-
type11 may be responsible for the increasing levels of aldos-
terone and thereby lead to insulin resistance and gestational
diabetes.
The literature data on association between the I/D poly-
morphism of the ACE gene and hypertension during preg-
nancy are contradictory. In Table 4, we summarize several
genetic studies which investigated the association of I/D
polymorphism of the ACE gene and BP level during preg-
nancy. In particular, a higher frequency of allele D and
genotype DD was reported among patients with pregnancy-
induced hypertension (PIH) in the Chinese population.31,32
One of the studies32 has found the association of genotype
DD with higher concentrations of plasma angiotensin II in
pregnant women with hypertension, as compared to healthy
women. Similar results were obtained in the Indian sample
consisting of 50 pregnant women with PIH and 50 pregnant
women with normotension.33 The authors reported the
association of genotype DD with PIH, although they did
not find any association of the I/D polymorphism with
either plasma ACE levels or hypertension.33
The study conducted on the Arabian population has
found a relationship between the genotype DD and hyper-
tension in pregnant women with preeclampsia.34 However,
contradictory results have been obtained in a number of
studies conducted in Chinese, Indian, African and Italian
populations.35­38 In particular, in the sample of 104 preg-
nant women from Northern India, no association of either

allele D or genotype DD with PIH was observed despite
the higher blood ACE levels in the carriers of DD genotype
as compared to the carriers of the ID and II genotypes.36
Similar results were reported for the Chinese, Africans
and Italians.35,37­39 A large study (more than 1000
Caucasian women) conducted by Pfab with coworkers did
not reveal the association of I/D polymorphism of the
ACE gene with BP level during a pregnancy.40 Meantime,
a meta-analysis of more than 50 studies showed a signifi-
cant association of the I/D polymorphism with PIH and
preeclampsia in Chinese,41,42 and in Asians and
Caucasians.43 The observed inconsistency in the above
results may be explained by inter-population and intereth-
nic differences in the distribution of the I/D polymor-
phism: allele D is predominant in Caucasians from
Europe, Australia and the USA, whereas allele I is more
prevalent among Chinese and Indians.44­47 Therefore, this
feature may explain the different clinical importance of
the polymorphism for PIH in populations of the world.
The existing inconsistency in the genetic studies warrants
further research into the role of the ACE gene in the regu-
lation of BP and the development of PIH.
