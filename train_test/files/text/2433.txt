Many studies rely on self-reports to capture population trends and trajectories in weight gain over adulthood, but
the validity of self-reports is often considered a limitation. The purpose of this work was to examine long-term tra-
jectories of self-reporting bias in a national sample of American youth. With 3 waves of data from the National Lon-
gitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1996­2008), we used growth curve models to examine self-reporting bias in
trajectories of weight gain across adolescence and early adulthood (ages 13­32 years). We investigated whether
self-reporting bias is constant over time, or whether adolescents become more accurate in reporting their weight as
they move into young adulthood, and we examined differences in self-reporting bias by sex, race/ethnicity, and
attained education. Adolescent girls underreported their weight by 0.86 kg on average, and this rate of underreport-
ing increased over early adulthood. In contrast, we found no evidence that boys underreported their weight either in
adolescence or over the early adult years. For young men, self-reports of weight were unbiased estimates of mea-
sured weight among all racial/ethnic and educational subpopulations over adolescence and early adulthood.

Although some population-based surveys use direct an-
thropomorphic measurements to track trends in obesity (1),
many studies rely on self-reported measures of weight and
height (2). Objective measurement of weight and height can
be prohibitively expensive in large population-based surveys,
and even impossible for studies that rely on telephone or mail
surveys. Self-reported data are easy and relatively inexpen-
sive to collect (3), but the validity of self-reports has been
questioned. Although biases in self-reported height are gen-
erally small (4­7), differences between self-reported and
measured weight are more marked. A number of studies have
investigated bias in self-reported weight in adult populations
and have generally found self-reports to be similar to mea-
sured weight (Pearson's r = 0.77­0.99) (8­11). Nevertheless,
self-reports of weight are consistently lower than measured
weight and also vary by individual characteristics, with
women and younger adults tending to underreport their
weight more than men and older adults (8, 9, 12).
There is comparatively less research examining self-
reported weight in adolescence and young adulthood--
critical periods of the life course for research on obesity
(13). Although some studies suggest that adolescents' reports
of weight are valid and reliable (14­16), others have raised
concerns (17­21). However, most of this research has been
limited to select, geographically defined samples. The Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
provides a unique opportunity to examine reporting bias dur-
ing youth, because it includes measures of both self-reported
and measured weight in a nationally representative sample of
American adolescents followed repeatedly into their young-
adult years (4 waves of data from 1994 to 2008). Goodman
et al. (22) compared self-reported and measured weight
using data from more than 10,000 adolescents in the second
wave (in 1996) of Add Health (the first wave for which mea-
sured weight data are available). They found a strong corre-
lation between measured and self-reported weight (r = 0.95),

and they found no evidence of self-reporting bias by race, pa-
rental education, or household income. However, they did
find that adolescent girls tended to underreport their weight
to a greater degree than adolescent boys.
More recently, Field et al. (23) extended this work to
examine differences in self-reported and measured weight
change across 2 waves (in 1996­2001) of Add Health data,
when subjects were aged 16­26 years. They found that
both males and females slightly underreported their weight
at both time points, but because underreporting was fairly
consistent, a measure of weight change was not biased by
self-report. However, to our knowledge, no research has ex-
amined long-term trajectories of self-reporting bias in a na-
tional sample of youth.
We used 11 years of data (3 waves, in 1996­2008) from
Add Health participants aged 13­32 years. We investigated
whether self-reporting bias is constant over time, or whether
adolescents become more accurate in reporting their weight
as they move into young adulthood, and we examined differ-
ences in self-reporting bias by sex, race/ethnicity, and at-
tained education.
METHODS
In 1994­1995, Add Health administered an in-school
questionnaire to more than 90,000 students from a nationally
representative sample of schools (24). A stratified random
sample of 20,745 adolescents was then interviewed in their
homes in 1995, constituting the baseline survey (wave 1) of
the longitudinal cohort. These adolescents were followed
1 year later in 1996 (wave 2, n = 14,738, 88.2% response rate),
5 years later in 2001­2002 (wave 3, n = 15,197, 77.4%
response rate), and most recently in 2007­2008 (wave 4, n =
15,701, 80.3% response rate). Nonresponse analysis con-
ducted by the Add Health study team suggests there is no
significant bias to Add Health estimates from attrition across

waves (25). Because measured weight data are only available
beginning in wave 2, we restricted our analyses to 19,238 re-
spondents who participated in any wave after wave 1. Thus,
respondents contributed anywhere from 1 to 3 observations
to the analyses. Secondary analysis of Add Health data for
this project was approved by the institutional review board
at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan).
Measures
Respondents were first asked to self-report their weight in
pounds at each interview (which was converted to kilograms
for analyses). Following the computer-assisted interview,
respondents were asked to remove their shoes and any
items from their pockets, and weight was measured to the
nearest 0.1 kg using a Health O Meter 844KL high-capacity
digital scale (Jarden Corp., Rye, New York) (26). Thus, we
have 2 measurements of weight at each wave in which a re-
spondent was interviewed, generating up to 6 observations
per person across all 3 waves. (Data were excluded for re-
spondents who were pregnant at the time of interview.) A
dummy variable was used to distinguish between measured
and self-reported weight in the data, and in the analysis, it
captures the difference between the 2 (e.g., underreporting)
over time.
Time-invariant covariates included sex and race/ethnicity
(captured using 4 dummy variables contrasting non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, Asian, and other race/ethnicity (e.g., Native
American) with white respondents). Attained education was
modeled using 3 dummy variables comparing those who did
not complete high school, those with a high school diploma,
and those with some college versus those with a college de-
gree or higher. Missing data on attained education by wave 4
(n = 1,381, 7.2%) was multiply imputed using SAS, version
9.2, software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina)
using data on sociodemographic covariates, educational per-
formance (grades and history of skipping or being suspended
from school), college aspirations, family income, parents'
education, parents' occupation, and parents' marital status
from prior waves (27, 28).
Statistical analyses
We used growth curve models to estimate trajectories of
weight gain over adolescence and early adulthood (29).
Age (centered at 13 years) was used as the indicator of time.
To address nonlinearity in weight gain trajectories, we fitted
and tested quadratic terms. All models were estimated in
Stata, version 12, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas) using full information maximum likelihood assuming

normally distributed residuals. Maximum likelihood pro-
duces unbiased coefficients under the assumption that the
attrition process is conditional on observed variables in our
models (30­32). All data and analyses were weighted by
time-varying cross-sectional weights (waves 2 through 4)
to account for the unequal probability of selection into the
Add Health sample, as well as differential nonresponse. Be-
cause of the consistent evidence for sex differences in self-
reporting bias (7), we ran separate models for males and
females.
RESULTS
The sample was equally divided by sex (n = 9,864 females,
n = 9,374 males). Almost two-thirds of the sample was white
and less than one-fifth was African American. Hispanics
made up approximately 12% of the sample, whereas Asians
and other racial/ethnic groups constituted a smaller minority
(4%). By the fourth wave of Add Health (when adolescents
had reached ages 24­32 years), the majority (44%) had ob-
tained some college education.
Trajectories of weight gain among young women
Results from the unconditional growth model are pre-
sented in model A (Table 1) for women. Coefficients repre-
sent the association between the independent variables and
weight in kilograms at baseline (intercept) and kilograms
per year of age (rate of change). Girls weighed 58 kg on av-
erage at age 13 years, and they gained weight at an average
rate of 1.2 kg per year to age 32 years. There was significant
variation in weight between girls at age 13 years and signifi-
cant variation in the rate of weight gain over time (variance
components). Model B indicates a significant quadratic term,
where weight increased rapidly early in adolescence and then
attenuated with age. Adolescent girls underreported their
weight by 0.86 kg on average at age 13 years (model C),
and this rate of underreporting increased with age.

In terms of racial/ethnic differences, the measured weight
of non-Hispanic black women was 4.63 kg more than that of
white women, but African American women underreported
their weight at similar levels to white women at age 13 years
(model D). There was no evidence of differential rates of
weight gain by race/ethnicity over time (model E), nor was
there any indication that self-reporting bias varied by race/
ethnicityovertime(modelsnotshown).Asianwomenweighed,
on average, 8.06 kg less than white women (model D) and
showed no evidence of self-report bias (^
 for self report =
-0.72 + 0.95 = 0.23 kg, which was not statistically different
from 0 in posthoc tests).
There was a strong educational gradient in measured weight
among females. In adolescence, young women who do not
eventually graduate from college weigh significantly more
than those who do and exhibit a more rapid rate of weight
gain over early adulthood (model E). For example, compared
with women with a college degree, women with a high school
education gained 0.78 kg more per year of age, although this
was attenuated at later ages as a function of the age2 term ( =
-0.02). There was also evidence of differential underreporting
of weight by attained education; young women with onlysome
college education underreported their weight by 0.29 kg more
than college graduates (models D and E).
Trajectories of weight gain among young men
Table 2 presents a similar set of models for young men. In
early adolescence, boys weighed 67.7 kg on average, which
was 9.7 kg more than girls at the same age. Boys also gained
weight more rapidly than girls, gaining 1.5 kg per year of age
(model A). Similar to the results for females, there was evi-
dence of a quadratic form to the model, with more rapid
weight gain early in adolescence that tapered off with increas-
ing age (model B). Model C in Table 2 adds the binary indi-
cator for self-report. Unlike girls, early-adolescent boys did
not underreport their weight at age 13 years and showed no
evidence of any reporting bias with increasing age.
There was no evidence of differential rates of measured
weight gain by race/ethnicity over time (model E), nor was
there any indication that self-reporting bias varied by race/
ethnicityovertime(modelsnotshown).Therewasnosignificant
difference in the measured weight of non-Hispanic black and
white adolescent males, but Hispanic males weighed 1.5 kg
less than white males, on average (model D). Similar to the
results for women, Asian males weighed 6.4 kg less than
white males and showed no evidence of self-reporting bias.
Adolescent boys who did not go on to graduate from college
weighed more than those who did ( = 1.47, model D). There

were no differences in self-reporting bias among young men
by education.
DISCUSSION
The use of self-reported body weight to monitor popula-
tion trends in obesity is controversial. Although some con-
sider self-reports to be valid and reliable (12, 15, 22), others
urge caution on the basis of findings that suggest a consistent
underreporting of weight, especially among adolescent girls
(7). Although most of the existing research has used cross-
sectional data (or data from 2 time points (23)), this study
examined trajectories of self-reporting bias in weight over
adolescence and young adulthood using multiple, repeated
observations from a nationally representative sample over a
13-year period.
Consistent with previous research (7), we found notable
differences in self-reporting bias by sex. Adolescent girls un-
derreported their weight, and underreporting increased over
early adulthood. The rate of underreporting was the same
for African American, white, and Hispanic young women,
but Asian women showed no evidence of self-reporting bias.
In contrast, we found no evidence that boys underreported
their weight either in adolescence or over the early adult
years. Nor did we find any evidence of self-report bias among
young men by racial/ethnic group or attained education.
Many researchers urge caution when interpreting popula-
tion trends in obesity and overweight on the basis of self-
reported weight data (4, 16, 20) and even apply a correction
factor to empirically adjust for self-report bias (33­35). Our
findings suggest that adolescent boys are accurate in reporting
their weight and remain consistently accurate throughout the
transition to young adulthood. Any correction for self-report
should, therefore, be reserved for young women. However,
such a correction factor should not be applied to young
Asian women, who were consistently accurate in reporting
their weight over time. Underreporting of weight in this
study may have been minimized because respondents were
interviewed in person. This study was also unable to explore
the role of other factors, such as social norms, which have
been shown to affect misreporting of weight (36) but are
not available in the Add Health data.
