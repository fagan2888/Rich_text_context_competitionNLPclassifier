Introduction
Recent studies indicate that consumers reveal an increased
preference for purchasing goods making "proenvironmental
claims" and products that promote "societal well-being,"
whether that may consist of fair wages to farmers, manufac-
turing processes, or general working conditions (Stratton &
Werner, 2013). Castaldo, Perrini, Misani, and Tencati (2009)
found that socially oriented companies that comply with
ethical and social requirements and/or acknowledge a com-
mitment to protect consumer rights and interests can suc-
cessfully leverage their reputation to market products with
high symbolic values and thereby increase the consumer's
intention to buy their products.
On the flipside, other studies indicate mixed results
regarding consumers' purchasing behaviors and whether
they do in fact respond favorably to socially responsible
business practices. Even though a majority of surveyed con-
sumers said they would be willing to pay extra for products
made under "good" working conditions abroad or domesti-
cally, rather than in sweatshops (Hiscox & Smyth, 2006), a
study by Prasad, Kimeldorf, Meyer, and Robinson (2004)
found that most consumers preferred to pay less for the
"unlabeled" (not fair trade certified) products, and that only
one in four was willing to pay more for "labeled" (fair trade
certified) products. However, the results did indicate that
those who were willing to pay more were willing to pay up to
40% more for the labeled products. This coincides with
results from the Hiscox and Smyth (2006) study, which indi-
cated that although volumes decreased for labeled products,
price increases made up for the reduced sales.
Frank (2003) provides an excellent survey of the history of
labor- and middle-class efforts to mobilize shopping on behalf
of working people from the late 19th century through the
present. The article outlines both class dynamics of such
movements and how they affect workers' ability to generate
consumer campaigns and what the author considers contem-
porary middle-class campaigns that treat workers as unorga-
nized, passive victims. It highlights the potentially detrimental
effects of consumer­labor campaigns across various dimen-
sions and dynamics of race, gender, and space. Consistently,
Haedicke (2013) argues in his study from the meatpacking
industry that neoliberal patterns of economic organization
and policies have, in addition to undermining labor unionism,

Social Justice Attitudes and Concerns
for Labor Standards: An Empirical
Investigation of the Theory of Planned
Behaviors and Consumer Actions
Michaela Schulz1 and Kristian F. Braekkan1
Abstract
This study utilizes an adapted version of the Social Justice Scale to capture and assess the extent to which social-justice-
related values and attitudes toward labor standards relate to consumer intentions and behaviors. This social cognitive model
assesses, based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, how "perceived behavior control" affects these behaviors either
directly or indirectly through consumers' intentions. It is hypothesized that individuals who value fairness and equity in social
interactions are going to be more likely to engage with businesses that are known for ethical business practices and abstain
from firms that are known to violate labor rights. The results confirm that consumers who are concerned with social justice
are less likely to conduct business with enterprises that have the reputation of violating both human rights and labor rights.
However, the results also reveal that consumers with low levels of "perceived behavioral control" justify their consumer
behaviors as they do not think that they can make a difference.

supported consumer-based strategies, which have limited the
potential to restructure power relations in the market.
Starting in the late 1990s, a variety of nongovernmental
systems for advancing labor standards and enforcement
began to emerge. These were designed to make it easier for
consumers to make more informed decisions in the market.
These systems aimed at increasing the transparency of exist-
ing initiatives, independence of monitors, convergence of
standards, and dynamics among nongovernmental regula-
tions, unions, and state enforcements. O'Rourke (2003)
argues that with increased transparency, improved technical
capacities, and new mechanisms of accountability to workers
and consumers, nongovernmental monitoring could comple-
ment existing state regulatory systems and thereby enhance
the consumers' ability to support workers' rights.
More than a decade has passed since O'Rourke's article
was published and concerns about labor and environmental
standards remain. Research continues to indicate that regula-
tions (nongovernmental or governmental) or consumer cam-
paigns have contributed to only minor changes. Bartley and
Child (2009) found no support for their hypothesis that anti-
sweatshop campaigns would decrease sales for firms exploit-
ing labor. They did, however, find that more intense
campaigns directed at products that are recognizable to con-
sumers had discernible effects on sales.
Concerns regarding ethical business practices are to a
great extent shaped by cognitions and affects (Gregory-
Smith, Smith, & Winklhofer, 2013). Some of these cogni-
tions may be shaped by the individual consumer's perceptions
of social justice, or the promotion of "fair and equitable allo-
cation of bargaining powers, resources, and obligations in
society in consideration of people's differential power, needs,
and abilities to express their wishes" (Prilleltensky, 2001,
p. 754). It would be reasonable to expect that someone who
values fairness and equity in social interactions would be
more likely to engage with businesses that are not known for
unethical business practices. Stated differently, one would
not expect someone who is concerned with social justice to
conduct business with enterprises that have the reputation of
violating human rights or what most people would consider
ethical behaviors. Nevertheless, previous research suggest
that consumers are often aware of the unethical behaviors but
justify their behaviors for a number of different reasons (e.g.,
Bose & Sarker, 2012; Gregory-Smith et al., 2013).
This article utilizes Ajzen's (1985) model of planned
behaviors to assess the extent to which social-justice-related
values and attitudes relate to consumer intentions and even-
tual behaviors. Specifically, we utilize The Social Justice
Scale (SJS) of planned behaviors developed by Torres-
Harding, Siers, and Olson (2012) to capture and assess an
individual's social attitudes and values and other constructs
that might be related to social justice behaviors. Furthermore,
we also assesses how "perceived behavior control" affects
consumers' intended or actual behaviors either directly or
indirectly.
Background, Theory, and Hypotheses
Contemporary Examples of Violations by Retailers
To position this article in a contemporary context, we will start
by utilizing the largest retailer in the world as an example.
Many have hailed the Wal-Mart story as an example of what
the "American Dream" can do for budding entrepreneurs as
the Walton family of Arkansas took a small business and
turned it into an undisputed retail "superpower." Critics, how-
ever, have argued that the success has come at the expense of
other retailers, suppliers, employees, and consumers.
In 2004, a Federal district court oversaw a class action
lawsuit on behalf of more than 1.5 million current and former
female employees of Wal-Mart retail stores nationwide ("Pay
Equality Overview"). The most well-known court case that
pertains to Wal-Mart's discrimination against female employ-
ees is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The plaintiffs claimed
that women for years had been paid less than male workers
in comparable positions. They also made the Federal court
aware of Wal-Mart's unchanging company system of passing
over female employees when awarding promotions to man-
agement. Cases much like this one have been brought to the
court system all over America.
Wal-Mart's competitors have also been scrutinized for
their business practices. In 2002, Target was one of a group
of retailers that together paid US$20 million to settle class
action lawsuits charging them with permitting sweatshop
conditions in factories run by their suppliers in Saipari, part
of the U.S. Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands in
the Pacific. More recently, additional discrimination and
inequality business practices of Target have come forth. In
2007, the company paid a total of more than US$1.2 million
to settle cases brought by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission involving alleged racial discrimi-
nation in hiring in Wisconsin and a racially hostile environ-
ment in Pennsylvania. In 2004, a Target contractor paid
US$1.9 million to settle an overtime-violation case brought
by the federal government on behalf of immigrant workers.
In 2009, another contractor settled an overtime lawsuit for
US$3.8 million.
In 2005, Best Buy paid US$200,000 to nine plaintiffs
accusing them of job discrimination and over US$10 million
for legal fees and costs. Eight current and former employees
and one job applicant filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District
Court in Oakland, California. They claimed that Best Buy
was denying promotions, transfers, and desirable job assign-
ments to African American, Latino, and female employees.
Best Buy did not deny these allegations, but instead decided
to implement a decree.
Consumer Behaviors and Planned Behaviors
Consumer behaviors represent decision-making processes
and acts of consumers when it comes to buying and using
products (i.e., the exchange process). The construct rests
Schulz and Braekkan 3
upon the assumption that consumers and their behaviors are
motivated and purposive (Berkman, 1992; Bose & Sarker,
2012). In other words, consumer behavior is a construct that
involves choices and planned behaviors.
When deciding which retail stores to shop in, and which
to not, consumers appear to take their own personal prefer-
ence into consideration, and we do not know the extent of
their awareness of unethical business decisions. A multitude
of questions arise: Why do people continue to support com-
panies with appalling business practices and are people sim-
ply unaware of these practices? or Could consumer behaviors
be explained by either cognitive dissonance?
The theory of cognitive dissonance has been considered
essential in understanding consumer behaviors for some time
(Bose & Sarker, 2012). The term describes a psychological
state in which cognitions, for example, beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors, are at odds (Festinger, 1957) and is typically asso-
ciated with attitude change. This is where theories of planned
behaviors appear to be fruitful in understanding consumer
behaviors in lieu of what appears to be obvious poor business
practices by the retailers.
The theory of planned behavior, first introduced by Ajzen
in 1985, has been one of the most utilized and influential
models for the prediction of human social behavior over the
last three decades (Ajzen, 2011). It represents a social cogni-
tive model that yields a practical framework to consider how
attitudes and related constructs might predict a number of
behaviors. The central tenet of this theory is that behavioral
performance is best directly predicted by one's stated inten-
tion to act. Ajzen's theory and model have been applied to a
range of health-related behaviors, for example, levels of
exercise, frequency of medical self-examinations, regulation
of eating/nutrition, safe driving behaviors, and volunteerism,
and in the field of environmental psychology (Hardeman
et al., 2002). The theory is also frequently used in areas such
as advertising, public relations, and organizational behavior
(Ajzen, 2011).
Ajzen's theory appears to be particularly fruitful when it
comes to predicting and understanding "ethical" consumer
behaviors. Previous research has indicated that emotions and
the prevalence of dissonance play a significant role in con-
sumer behaviors (see Gregory-Smith et al., 2013 as a recent
example). Violations by retailers, whether they materialize in
the form of gender or race discrimination, antiunion mea-
sures, the utilization of child labor in the supply chain, or
lack of worker benefits, are frequent topics in news media.
Hence, it is reasonable to expect that most consumers are
aware of potential unethical business practices among the
major retailers in the marketplace.
Taking a step back, Ajzen (1991) suggests that one's
intentions to act are predicted by one's attitudes toward the
action, subjective norms around the action, and one's per-
ceived behavioral control of the action. Attitudes involve
general dispositions toward a given behavior. As suggested
by Torres-Harding and colleagues (2012), with respect to
social justice, it would involve an individual's acceptance of
the social justice ideals and related values (e.g., such as the
belief that one should act for social justice, or that it is right
or fair to promote equality of opportunity for everyone,
regardless of background.)
Subjective norms include support, or lack thereof, pro-
vided in an environment for performing a given behavior.
Ajzen (1991) suggests that the inclusion of subjective norms
describes a mechanism by which the social context can influ-
ence the occurrence of a behavior. Consistent with Torres-
Harding and colleagues (2012), in social justice work,
contextual messages, norms, and support would facilitate
one's intentions to act for social justice.
Perceived behavioral control is, according to Ajzen (1991),
one's perceived ability to perform an act. In a social justice
context, this would encompass the extent to which a person
feels it is possible to "make a difference," or the self-evalua-
tion of whether one can have an impact on existing social con-
ditions. Ajzen notes that perceived behavioral control could
directly predict intentions to act and, in some cases, also
directly predict behavioral performance itself if the action
itself was particularly difficult or challenging. Torres-Harding
and colleagues (2012) suggest that many of the social justice­
promoting actions could be viewed as particularly difficult or
challenging because it involves changing the status quo
(Prilleltensky & Nelson, 2002; Torres-Harding et al., 2012).
It is expected that an individual's acceptance of social
justice ideals and related values affect their consumer
behaviors. Specifically, it would be natural to assume that
consumers who value social justice will not engage in
economic exchanges with retailers who infringe on work-
ers' rights to unionize, are known to exploit workers, and
who utilize unethical practices throughout their supply
chains (e.g., use of child labor or forced labor in facto-
ries). Hence, utilizing Ajzen's model, we propose the fol-
lowing hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1a (H1a): Individuals with a high degree of
acceptance of social justice ideals and related values (e.g.,
attitudes toward the behavior), such as the belief that one
should act for social justice, or that it is right or fair to
promote equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless
of background will intend to act consistently with these
values through their consumer behaviors.
Hypothesis 1b (H1b): Intentions to act will mediate the
relationship between the attitudes toward the behavior
and the actual behavior.
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): Individuals experiencing subjec-
tive norms in their environment in favor of performing a
given behavior consistent with social justice will intend to
act consistently with these values through their consumer
behaviors.
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): Intentions to act will mediate the
relationship between subjective norms and the actual
behavior.
4 SAGE Open
Hypothesis 3a (H3a): Individuals with high-perceived
behavioral control with respect to social justice will intend
to act consistently with values through their consumer
behaviors.
Hypothesis 3b (H3b): Intentions to act will mediate the
relationship between perceived subjective norms and the
actual behavior.
Hypothesis 3c (H3c): Individuals with high-perceived
behavioral control will act consistently with their values
through their consumer behaviors.
The full model is illustrated in Figure 1 below:
Method
Sample and Procedure
The participants in this study consisted of 299 (response rate:
85%) undergraduate college students from a small liberal
arts college in the United States. Stratified sampling tech-
niques were utilized to capture students at different class lev-
els and from different fields of study. Following IRB approval
by the institution, the subjects were provided with an
informed consent in which the subjects were told that the
study aimed to study planned behaviors, intentions, and con-
sumer behaviors. Of the respondents, 160 (53%) identified
as male and 139 (47%) as female. The mean age was approx-
imately 20 years (SD = 1.8).
Measures. The study utilized an adapted version of the Social
Justice Scale (SJS) developed by Torres-Harding and col-
leagues (2012) designed to measure how college students
differ on their attitudes and values regarding social justice.
The SJS is based on Ajzen's model and is designed with the
purpose of measuring social-justice-related values, attitudes,
perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and inten-
tions based on a four-factor conception of Ajzen's theory.
The development of the scale included a confirmatory factor
analysis and analyses for reliability and validity to test the
properties of the scale. Furthermore, we added items designed
to capture the students' actual consumer behaviors and how
they let firms' labor standards and ethics affect their deci-
sions to do business with a particular retailer.
Social Justice Attitudes (SJA) were measured utilizing the
original 11 items from Torres-Harding and colleagues'
(2012) scale. These items included "I believe that it is impor-
tant to make sure that all individuals and groups have a
chance to speak and be heard, especially those from tradi-
tionally ignored or marginalized groups," "I believe that it is
important to allow individuals and groups to define and
describe their problems, experiences and goals in their own
terms," and "I believe that it is important to talk to others
about societal systems of power, privilege, and oppression."
Responses were made on a 7-point scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Cronbach's  for
this scale was .82.
Social Justice Perceived Behavioral Control (SJPBC)
was measured utilizing the original five items from Torres-
Harding and colleagues' (2012) scale. These items included,
"I am confident that I can have a positive impact on others'
lives," "I am certain that I possess an ability to work with
individuals and groups in ways that are empowering," and
"If I choose to do so, I am capable of influencing others to
promote fairness and equality." Responses were made on a
7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree). Cronbach's  for this scale was .67.
Social Justice Subjective Norms (SJSN) were measured
utilizing the original four items from Torres-Harding and
colleagues' (2012) scale. These items included "Other peo-
ple around me are engaged in activities that address social
injustices," "Other people around me feel that it is important
to engage in dialogue around social injustices," and "Other
people around me are supportive of efforts that promote
social justice." Responses were made on a 7-point scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Cronbach's  for this scale was .75.
Social justice behavioral intentions (SJBI) were measured
utilizing the original four items from Torres-Harding and
colleagues' (2012) scale. These items included, "In the
future, I will do my best to ensure that all individuals and
groups have a chance to speak and be heard," "In the future,
I intend to talk with others about social power inequalities,
social injustices and the impact of social forces on health and
well-being," and "In the future, I intend to engage in activi-
ties that will promote social justice." Responses were made
on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree). Cronbach's  for this scale was .86.
Aseven-item scale was developed and used to assess actual
consumer behaviors. Items included, "I let price or quality of
the products that I desire dictate where I shop," "I do not go out
of my way to find a business known to utilize ethical business
practices if a more convenient choice exists," "I let retailers'
business practices influence my decision to shop at their
stores," "I do not shop with retailers that I know, or suspect
sells products produced with child labor," "I do not shop at
retail stores if I suspect that working conditions are poor in fac-
tories supplying their products," "I do not shop at retail stores if
I suspect that working conditions are poor in the stores," and

"When shopping at retail stores I do not consider the retailer's
reputation regarding their business practices." The items were
selected following a preliminary factor analysis of 25 items.All
items had a 7-point Likert-type scale response format (e.g., 1 =
strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Internal consistency
estimates (alpha coefficients) were .86.
A number of control variables were used in the analyses:
gender, age, year in school, ethnicity, major, and previous work
experience. In addition, four items were generated to control
for the respondents' existing knowledge of labor issues. These
items included, "I am concerned with retail workers'benefits,"
"I pay attention to retail workers'rights to unionize," "I am not
concerned with retail workers'wages," and "I find it difficult to
know what companies utilize questionable business practices."
All items had a 7-point Likert-type scale response format (e.g.,
1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).
Results
The means, standard deviations, intercorrelations, and reli-
abilities for all the variables in this study are provided in
Table 1. Cronbach alpha values for the scaled variables are
also included in these tables.
Consistent with H1a, an individual's degree of acceptance
of social justice ideals and related values (e.g., attitudes
toward the behavior), such as the belief that one should act
for social justice, or that it is right or fair to promote equality
of opportunity for everyone, regardless of background
aligned with an intention to act consistent with these ideals
and values. "Attitudes toward the behavior" were strongly
correlated with "intentions to act" (r = .65, p < .05).
Whereas the relationships remained statistically signifi-
cant in the regression analysis ( = .63, p < .05) as indicated
in Table 2, neither constructs correlated with the actual
behaviors ( = .11, p = .55;  = .09, p = .65, respectively).
Hence, H1a was supported while H1b was rejected. No sig-
nificant gender or "age/year in school" differences existed.
Findings in Table 3 indicate that individuals experiencing
subjective norms in their environment in favor of performing
a given behavior consistent with social justice also intended
to act consistently with these values through their consumer
behaviors ( = .49, p < .05), but neither their subjective
norms nor intentions were reflected in their reported actual
actions ( = .05, p = .64;  = .09, p < .65, respectively).
Hence, H2a was supported while H2b was rejected. No sig-
nificant gender or "age/year in school" differences existed.
Results in Table 4 show that individuals with high-per-
ceived behavioral control with respect to social justice

endorsed intended consumer behaviors consistent with H3a
( = .72, p < .05). Hence, H3a was confirmed. H3b suggested
that intentions to act would mediate the relationship between
perceived subjective norms and the actual behavior. As
already noted, no significant relationship existed between
intentions to act and the actual behaviors ( = .09, p < .65).
Hence, H3b was rejected. However, individuals with high-
perceived behavioral control endorsed consumer behaviors
consistent with H3c ( = .77, p < .05). Hence, H3c, which
suggested a direct relationship between perceived behavioral
control and behaviors, was confirmed.
We conducted follow-up analyses to see if the respon-
dents' "interests and knowledge" in "industrial relations"
and "labor relations" would affect the relationship between
perceived behavioral control and the respondents' consumer
behaviors. Hence, a series of moderated regression analyses
were performed. Consistent with Aiken and West (1991), the
variables used in the interaction were centered at their means
to make the results more interpretable.
As shown in Table 5 and illustrated in Figure 2, the effects
of "perceived behavioral control" on "consumer behaviors"
varied across levels of "interests and knowledge."
As Figure 2 illustrates, the positive relationship between
"perceived behavioral control" and "consumer behaviors" was
significantly strengthened among respondents endorsing high
"interests and knowledge." The slope analysis confirmed this.
Among individuals with low "interests and knowledge,"
endorsing low "perceived behavioral control" scored on aver-
age 2.60 on "consumer behaviors," while individuals with low
"interests and knowledge" endorsing high "perceived behav-
ioral control" scored on average 2.82 (t = 0.75, p = .71).

However, individuals with high "interests and knowledge"
endorsing low "perceived behavioral control" scored on aver-
age 2.38 (almost identical to the low-interest/low-control sub-
jects), while individuals with high "interests and knowledge"
endorsing high "attitudes" scored on average 4.20 (t = 9.42, p <
.05). In other words, whereas there were minimal differences in
terms of consumer behaviors when perceived behavioral con-
trol was low between individuals with different degrees of
interest and knowledge, the gap widened significantly as per-
ceived level of control increased. Specifically, there were sta-
tistically significant differences on consumer behaviors scores
between high and low interest and knowledge subjects among
those with high perceived control.
Discussion
Implications
This study contributes to our understanding of how cogni-
tions and affects regarding ethical business practices affect
consumer behaviors. Normally, one would expect that some-
one who values fairness and equity in social interactions
would be less likely to engage with businesses that are known
for unethical business practices. However, consistent with
previous research, findings in this article suggest that con-
sumers who are aware of unethical behaviors do not neces-
sarily let their intentions lead to consistent outcomes.
Results from this study indicate that individuals scoring
high on measures of social justice ideals and related values
(e.g., attitudes toward the behavior), such as the belief that
one should act for social justice, or that it is right or fair to
promote equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of
background showed intentions to act consistently with these
values through their consumer behaviors (H1a), but these
intentions did not relate to self-reported actual behaviors
(inconsistent with H1b). In other words, intentions to act did
not mediate the relationship between the attitudes toward the
behavior and actual behaviors.
Similarly, individuals experiencing subjective norms in
their environment in favor of performing a given behavior
consistent with social justice revealed intentions to act con-
sistently with these values through their consumer behaviors
(as suggested by H2a), but these did not translate into actual
behaviors (H2b). Hence, intentions to act did not mediate the
relationship between subjective norms and actual behaviors.
Subjective norms can therefore be rejected as a possible pre-
dictor of consumer behaviors that are consistent with such
environmental norms.
On the contrary, the study confirmed that respondents
endorsing high behavioral control with respect to social jus-
tice both intended to act consistently with values through
their consumer behaviors (H3a) and their actual behaviors
(H3b). In other words, the results suggest that intentions to
act both mediated the relationship between perceived subjec-
tive norms and the actual behavior as these individuals
reported acting consistently with their values through their
consumer behaviors.
There are a number of other takeaways from the findings
in this study with respect to what we know about concerns
about labor standards and other social-justice-related issues.
These findings have been summarized in five major catego-
ries to make them concise and clear.
First, attitudes and general dispositions toward a given
behavior, such as the belief that one should act for social jus-
tice, or that it is right or fair to promote equality of opportu-
nity for everyone, regardless of background, is not by itself a
predictor of behaviors. Such attitudes appear to generate to
some intentions, but not necessarily lead to concrete actions.
As an example, having a favorable view of work that seeks to
rectify wrongs in the workplace is not sufficient to affect
consumer behaviors.
Second, experiencing subjective norms, such as contex-
tual messages, norms, and support may facilitate one's inten-
tions to act for social justice, but not necessarily lead to
action. In other words, this study revealed that although sub-
jects endorsing such support appeared to also endorse inten-
tions to act consistently with these norms, they did not
necessarily act upon these intentions. Hence, attitudes, dis-
positions, and environmental norms are not sufficient to
affect consumer behaviors.
Third, perceived behavioral control, or one's perceived
ability to perform an act in a social justice context, appears to
be a strong predictor of consumer behaviors. The extent to
which a person feels it is possible to "make a difference" and
have an impact on existing social conditions will affect both
intentions and actions according to these results. In sum-
mary, Individuals who value social justice will not engage in
economic exchanges with retailers who infringe on workers'
rights to unionize, are known to exploit workers, and who
utilize unethical practices throughout their supply chains
(e.g., use of child labor or forced labor in factories) unless
they perceive that their actions can change the status quo.
Fourth, it is evident that consumers need to be educated
about workplace rights. As Table 5 indicates, it is the combi-
nation of interest and knowledge that affect actions. Interest
alone is not enough. One may think of how generations of
the past were very well informed about social justice issues
such as civil rights, Western warfare in other hemispheres,
and gender equality and how these issues were pushed for-
ward by activists at a broad scale. Whereas issues of environ-
mental concern appear to become a larger part of the U.S.
curriculum in both secondary and tertiary education systems,
little is done to promote issues of workplace rights. These
findings strongly suggest that actions change when there is
an interaction of knowledge and interest.
Fifth, we live with the challenge of limited "behavioral
control." As Lilley, McNally, Yuen, Davis, and Henwood
(2011) documented very well in their collection of essays,
Catastrophism, the political left has, to a great extent, used
fear tactics to call people to action and they question these
8 SAGE Open
tactics. Their arguments hinge on the idea that people become
passive and compliant when issues are introduced as cata-
strophic or beyond their control. One may even argue that
unless people are encouraged to "make change" one con-
sumer at a time, we fall victims to the powers that want to
maintain the status quo. Table 5 reveals that experiencing
behavioral control is absolutely key for becoming an agent of
change.
Limitations of Study
Whereas the study has added to our understanding of how
social justice attitudes, social norms, and perceived control
affect consumer behaviors, there were limitations that should
be addressed. The data were based on self-reports that were
collected cross-sectionally. Biases may therefore be present
due to common-method variance (CMV). The study fol-
lowed recommendations by Conway and Lance (2010) and
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) and uti-
lized existing instruments that have been proven to be both
reliable and valid in previous studies in an attempt to over-
come some of these problems. The extent to which CMV
was a problem in the data was calculated based on the proce-
dures described by Podsakoff and colleagues (2003). The
results indicated that the average variance explained by the
CMV was less than 0.75%, which is considered acceptable
and fair (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The surveys utilized coun-
terbalancing question order to reduce the potential of such
problems. Finally, a remaining concern is the utilization of
self-reports. This is difficult to overcome with this research
design as the constructs measured are latent individual con-
structs and the authors were unable to observe actual
behaviors.
Future Studies
Future research could utilize longitudinal data. Causality was
not addressed in this study due to its use of cross-sectional
data, so there is a possibility that those acting consistent with
their values experience higher perceived control as a result of
their actions. Hence, these respondents could become more
cognitively aware of how actions directed against unethical
businesses generate "control."
Although the sample was of moderate size (n = 299),
future studies could benefit from the use of larger samples
and possibly a larger variety of respondents to draw compari-
sons between different demographics. It could also be bene-
ficial to replicate this study and compare differences among
subjects with different income levels. One may look at how
high-income individuals perceive the importance of labor
standards and other social-justice-related issues in compari-
son with individuals with lower income.
Future studies may also use theoretical frameworks such
as those offered by the theory of reasoned action (see
Fishbein &Ajzen, 1975 for an overview), which is frequently
used in psychology to predict how individuals will behave
based on their preexisting attitudes and behavioral inten-
tions, and Bandura's (see Bandura, 1986) concept of self-
efficacy, to examine intentions and consumer behaviors. The
latter concept might be particularly fruitful in this context as
it lends itself to examine various paths in the development of
self-efficacy, the dynamics of self-efficacy, and lack thereof,
and habits of attribution that contribute to, or detract from,
self-efficacy.
Finally, this study utilized college students who were
asked to reflect upon their consumer behaviors and inten-
tions. One may want to examine whether these results would
hold true as age increases. If these behaviors are unique to
this group of consumers as a result of, for instance, limited
disposable income, the literature may benefit from a broader
demographic in future samples.
