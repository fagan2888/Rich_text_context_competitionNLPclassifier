ABSTRACT
Aims To examine age-18 risk factors for alcohol use and heavy drinking during early (ages 22 and 26) and middle
(age 35) adulthood, and for symptoms of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in middle adulthood. Design Nationally
representative samples of US adolescents in their senior year of secondary school (age 18) were followed into middle
adulthood. Structural equation models estimated the associations between age-18 characteristics and current drinking
and heavy drinking at ages 22, 26 and 35 and symptoms of AUDs at age 35. Participants The sample consisted of
21 137 respondents from 11 senior year cohorts (1976­86) from the Monitoring the Future study. Findings Many
predictor variables had stable associations with alcohol use over time, although their ability to explain variance in
alcohol use declined with increasing time lags. Being white predicted alcohol use, but not symptoms of AUDs. Parental
drinking, risk taking and use of cigarettes and marijuana predicted heavy drinking to age 35. Planning to attend
college predicted more heavy drinking at age 22 and less frequent heavy drinking by mid-life. High school theft and
property damage predicted later AUD symptoms. Most associations were invariant across gender, with variations
typically taking the form of stronger associations between predictors and alcohol use for men. Invariance in findings
across cohorts indicates that results reflect general developmental trends rather than specific historically bounded ones.
Conclusions Many adolescent individual and contextual characteristics remain important predictors of adult alcohol
use and abuse, and their predictive impact varies as a function of age and type of alcohol outcome. These associations
are largely equivalent across gender and cohort, thus reflecting robust developmental linkages.

INTRODUCTION
In any given year, between 7 and 9% of the US adult
population suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence
[1,2], suggesting the very large economic and human
capital tolls of alcohol use disorders. At the same time,
most adults who use alcohol do so without any short- or
long-term difficulties. In fact, moderate drinking, defined
by the US Department of Health and Human Services and
the US Department of Agriculture [3] as no more than
one drink/day for women and no more than two drinks/
day for men, can have health-promoting effects [4].These
unique qualities of alcohol--namely, the effects of its use
being devastating for some and neutral or even salutary
for others--underscore the importance of delineating the
individual characteristics and experiences that contri-
bute to variation in the etiology and course of alcohol use
and abuse across the life-span.
In particular, given that adolescence is when alcohol
use typically onsets and escalates, as well as the pivotal
role adolescence can play in adult health [5­7], an impor-
tant set of questions pertain to how adolescent charac-
teristics and experiences contribute to variation in adult
alcohol use and abuse; due to the dearth of long-term
prospective studies, these questions have received little
attention. Of course, alcohol use and abuse during adult-
hood are not static, so in addition to interindividual varia-
tion there are important developmental variations, such

hood and then decline thereafter [8­13].Thus, not only is
it important to examine the adolescent risk factors for
adult alcohol use, it is also important to examine the
extent to which the associations between such risk factors
and alcohol outcome vary as a function of both age and
the type of alcohol outcome under investigation. Accord-
ingly, the purpose of the present study is to examine ado-
lescent risk factors for early and middle adult alcohol use
and abuse, within a US national multi-cohort panel study
following young people from age 18 to age 35.
Adolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use and alcohol
use disorders
As measured typically, there is a distinction between
alcohol use and heavy drinking; alcohol use refers to the
frequency and/or quantity of use, whereas heavy drink-
ing is a subcategory referring to excessive use in a rela-
tively short amount of time (sometimes called `binge
drinking' and measured traditionally as having five or
more drinks in a row) [11,14]. Alcohol use disorders
(AUDs), psychiatric disorders as defined by the DSM-IV
[15], include alcohol abuse, a condition in which alcohol
use is disruptive to an individual's personal life or respon-
sibilities, and alcohol dependency in which an individual
becomes physically tolerant to or dependent on alcohol.
Because alcohol use, heavy drinking and AUDs represent
varying levels of both normative alcohol involvement
and disorder, they are likely to have different adolescent
predictors; we include each as adult outcomes in the
present study.
Adolescent risk factors for concurrent and future
alcohol use and abuse are conceptualized to range from
characteristics of the individual to facets of the individu-
al's social context [16­18]. Given the purposes of this
study, it was important to include a wide range of risk and
protective factors capturing numerous aspects of adoles-
cents' lives including individual characteristics related
to conventionality, education, peer involvement, risk-
taking, deviancy and well-being, along with salient social
context and demographic characteristics. We focus in
particular on factors that are known to be related con-
temporaneously to alcohol use during adolescence so
that we can determine their staying power in predicting
adult alcohol use and abuse.
The associations between individuals' social and
family background and their alcohol use tend to be sub-
stantial during adolescence. In the United States, white
adolescents exhibit higher rates of alcohol consumption
than nearly all other racial/ethnic groups, particularly
African Americans [2], a finding that may relate to
higher religiosity among African Americans [19] and
may not be present much beyond adolescence [20]. Chil-
dren of divorce tend to exhibit higher adolescent alcohol
use [21] and more symptoms of drug and alcohol abuse
[22]; similarly, adolescents from single-parent homes are
more likely than those from two-parent homes to exhibit
problem substance use [23]. However, whether these
effects of parental divorce and single parenthood extend
into adulthood is unclear. Having parents who abused
alcohol is a well-established risk factor for AUDs especially
among males [24­27]; this association is probably attrib-
utable to a combination of genetic risk, modeling of
drinking behaviors and the effects of parental drinking
on the home environment.
Ties to broader social institutions can also be protec-
tive against alcohol use, at least during adolescence [17].
It has been well documented that religiosity is an impor-
tant protective factor [19], although it is unclear whether
adolescent religiosity has any long-term predictive rela-
tion to adult alcohol use and abuse. Adolescent educa-
tional success and plans have been found to predict lower
adolescent and adult alcohol use [17,28­30], although
college attendance relates to heavier drinking and
alcohol abuse during early adulthood and higher rates of
alcohol use (but not disorders) into adulthood [31]. Dif-
ferential drinking patterns between young adults who
attend college and those who do not are probably a result
of early and heavier use among adolescents who do not
go on to college, and heavy use among those in college
due in part to the normative aspect of heavy drinking on
many college campuses [12,28,32].
Many risk-taking and externalizing behaviors that are
uncommon among other age groups occur more fre-
quently during adolescence. When they co-occur, these
behaviors have been viewed as components of a problem
behavior syndrome [33,34]. Some of these behaviors
have been found to be effective in predicting which indi-
viduals will use or misuse alcohol into adulthood. For
example, externalizing behavior in adolescence [24] and
adolescent deviant behaviors predict adult alcohol abuse
and dependence [35,36].
Mentalhealthandwell-beingalsorelatetoalcoholuse.
Adolescent internalizing difficulties including depressive
affect and anxiety relate to adolescent alcohol and other
drug use [37], and also predict adult alcohol dependence
[36,38]. However, findings regarding the associations
between alcohol use and mental health are mixed, with
some suggesting the potential for AUDs to cause mood
disorders [39] and others showing stronger associations
between negative affect and problem drinking than
between negative affect and more normative alcohol use
[40]. The relationships between heavy alcohol use and
mental health are likely to be complex. For example,
research examining patterns of heavy drinking over time
finds less depressive affect among chronic heavy drinkers
than among infrequent heavy drinkers [41].

Alcohol use is associated frequently with the use
of other addictive and psychoactive substances. For
example, a body of evidence suggests that drinking
alcohol and smoking cigarettes have a high rate of
co-occurrence [42­44]. Cigarette smoking is the most
stable of drug use behaviors in that it is usually initiated
by the end of high school and, once established, desis-
tance from smoking is less likely than desistance from use
of other substances [9,29]. Because rates of desistance
from smoking are low and cigarette use co-occurs with
alcohol use, we would expect cigarette use at the end of
high school to be useful in predicting later alcohol use.
High school use of marijuana and other illicit drugs may
also relate to later drinking, either as a function of
deviance-proneness or proclivity to use psychoactive
substances.
Variation in prediction as a function of developmental
period, gender and cohort
Because adolescence is a time when many consequential
life decisions are made, adolescent experiences should
have strong implications for adult functioning. However,
adolescence is also a time when risky behaviors become
temporarily more normative than they are at other times
in the life-span. For some adolescents, engaging in risky
behaviors may be temporally limited, while for others
these behaviors are part of long-term problems [45­47].
During adolescence, those individuals for whom these
behaviors are developmentally limited and those for
whom they are indicative of life-long disorders may look
similar. Therefore, the normative nature of risk-taking
and externalizing behaviors in late adolescence could
limit their usefulness in predicting long-term drinking
outcomes.
Similarly, because drinking behaviors follow a devel-
opmental pattern, predictors are likely to vary as a func-
tion of the age of assessment of adult alcohol use and
abuse. Indeed, risk factors associated with drinking
within one age group of adults may be unassociated with
drinking among another age group [48]. In the present
study, we focus on three ages in adulthood: age 22
(corresponding with the peak of binge drinking), age 26
(an age by which the assumption of many adult roles has
occurred for most) and age 35 (corresponding with
beginning of middle adulthood) [28]. We expect that the
associations between adolescent risk factors (particularly
those that become temporarily normative during adoles-
cence) and alcohol outcomes will generally grow weaker
across the three ages. Some of the risk factors (e.g. racial/
ethnic group, parental education, single parent and
parental drinking) are static, in that they do not change
or at a minimum are well established by the end of high
school; accordingly, they may be more likely to maintain
their predictive power across adulthood.
Differences in alcohol use patterns between men and
women indicate the importance of examining gender dif-
ferences and interactions in alcohol research. Alcohol
abuse and dependence occur more frequently in men
than in women and, on average, men consume more
alcohol than women [1,2]. In addition to mean level dif-
ferences, normal developmental patterns include a slower
decrease in drinking during adulthood among men than
among women [49]. Furthermore, the associations
between risk factors and alcohol outcomes have been
found to vary as a function of gender, particularly for
academic achievement and deviant behaviors [50], and
possibly for depressive symptoms as well [51]. Similarly,
some evidence suggests greater heritability for AUDs
among males than among females [27].Thus, we include
a focus on gender differences and similarities in our pre-
dictive models.
Historical period may contribute to differences in
levels of risk factors and outcomes and, perhaps more
interestingly, to relationships among risk factors and out-
comes [33,52]. Because the Monitoring the Future (MTF)
data set used here includes 11 cohorts (1976­86) of high
school graduates who were followed into adulthood, we
have the unique opportunity to test the generalizability of
results across 11 senior year cohorts in this paper, pro-
viding some insight about the extent to which findings
reflect developmental trends and/or historical trends
(i.e. cohort-specific effects or period effects).
This paper extends current knowledge regarding the
associations between adolescent risk factors and later
alcohol use and abuse by using US multi-cohort national
longitudinal data, by including multiple adolescent risk
factors from a variety of domains and by including up to
four adult alcohol outcomes at three different ages. The
goals of this paper are to determine: (i) the associations
between adolescent risk and protective factors and later
alcohol outcomes; and (ii) whether the associations
between adolescent risk and protective factors and later
alcohol outcomes vary with gender, age and type of
outcome, and cohort.
METHODS
Respondents
Respondents are from the MTF national panel study [11].
Each year, MTF surveys a nationally representative
sample of about 17 000 American adolescents who are
in their senior year of secondary school (modal age 18).
Approximately 2400 respondents are selected randomly
from each senior year cohort for follow-up into young
adulthood and beyond. Follow-up mail surveys are con-
ducted on a biennial basis until age 30. After age 30, data
are collected at 5-year intervals. For the purpose of this

study, we selected respondents who had completed at
least the first follow-up (modal ages 19­20) and were old
enough for potential inclusion in the age 35 survey (high
school classes of 1976­86). Of a possible approximately
26 400 respondents selected for follow-up, 21 137 (80%)
provided sufficient data (5263 did not respond to the first
follow-up survey and 113 failed to indicate their gender).
Because high school students who reported drug use
were oversampled for inclusion in the follow-up sample,
analyses used selection weights.
Each respondent received one of five randomly distrib-
uted forms during their senior year, and was sent the
same form for each follow-up. All forms contained infor-
mation regarding respondents' alcohol use and many of
the predictors used in this paper. In addition, one of the
forms contained several items relevant to the current
study that were not duplicated on any other form. Previ-
ous publications [11,28,53] provide more detailed infor-
mation regarding the study's design, as does the study's
website [54].
Measures
Adult alcohol outcomes
Thirty-day and heavy alcohol use were measured at ages
22, 26 and 35 (and at age 18), while symptoms of
alcohol abuse and dependence were assessed only at age
35. These measures are described below, and means and
standard deviations are presented in Table 1 by gender; as
indicated, gender differences are significant for all mea-
sures at each age, with men having higher use and
symptom counts than women.
Thirty-day alcohol use. Respondents were asked about the
number of times they drank in the 30 days prior to each
survey. Responses ranged from one (never) to seven
(40 times or more).
Heavy drinking. Respondents were asked about the
number of occasions on which they drank five or more
drinks in a row during the 2 weeks prior to each survey.
Responses ranged from one (never) to six (10 or more
times).
Alcohol use disorders: symptoms of abuse and dependence.
AUDs were measured through symptoms of both alcohol
abuse and dependence. A nine-item symptom count indi-
cating each respondent's number of symptoms of alcohol
abuse in the 5 years prior to the age 35 survey was used
to construct a count of abuse symptoms.The items in this
symptom count (e.g. `Has your use of alcohol in the last
5 years hurt your relationship with your spouse?') are
based on DSM-IV criteria and are consistent with the
measurement of alcohol abuse in other large-scale
surveys [55­57]. A five-item scale indicated the number
of symptoms of alcohol dependence present in the
5 years prior to the age 35 survey. Items included symp-
toms of both tolerance (e.g. `needed more to get the same
effect') and physical dependence (e.g. `used alcohol to
avoid hangovers'). These items are based on the DSM-IV
criteria for alcohol dependence and are consistent with
how alcohol dependence has been measured in the
National Comorbidity Survey [58] and other large-scale
studies [57].

Adolescent risk factors
Table 2 provides information regarding the measures of
adolescent risk factors. At the time of the senior year
survey, respondents provided information regarding their
race/ethnicity, parental education and whether they lived
in a single-parent home. At the time of the age 35 survey,
respondents were asked to recall their experience of
parental drinking. In the senior year survey, respondents
also answered questions regarding their religious atten-
dance, grades, college plans, truancy, evenings out, risk-
taking, aggression, theft/property damage, self-esteem
and depressive affect. [To measure depressive affect we
included items from the MTF survey reflecting self-
derogation (feelings of worthlessness and guilt), which is
an important aspect of depression (and consistent with
items on the Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) [59]). Symptoms of depression range from
somatic disturbances to anhedonia, indicating that we
are measuring just one aspect, albeit an important one, of
depression.] They also reported their cigarette use, mari-
juana use and use of other illicit drugs.
Attrition and missing data strategy
As mentioned above, respondents who completed the
first follow-up survey after high school and were eligible
for the age 35 survey were included in the analyses
regardless of their level of response to subsequent
surveys. In order to minimize bias associated with
attrition after ages 19­20, we used full information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, a missing data
algorithm available within MPlus [60]. [With regard to
adolescents who attrited before the age 19­20 follow-
up, previous attrition analyses conducted with other
samples from MTF (e.g. [61,62]) found that those who
remained in the study were more likely to be female and
white; to be higher on parental education, religious
attendance, high school grades and college expectations;
and to be lower on substance use. These analyses also
found that relations among variables were not affected
by differential attrition.] Compared to simple case-wise
deletion and most other missing data procedures, FIML
is superior for minimizing bias due to attrition [63­66].
FIML is also appropriate to use to account for data
missing due to the planned missingness inherent in the
multiple form structure of MTF [63]. Although some of
the variables (including risk-taking, aggression, theft/
property damage, self-esteem and depressive affect) were
on only one of the five questionnaire forms (thus distri-
buted to only a random 20% of respondents), FIML
allows for the analyses of data from all respondents
[64].

Analysis plan
Preliminary analyses included zero-order correlations
conducted separately for men and women between age
18 individual and contextual variables and alcohol use at
age 18 and at each follow-up. To examine our primary
research questions, path analyses using adolescent risk
factors to predict each of the three domains of adult
alcohol involvement (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy
drinking and symptoms of alcohol abuse and depen-
dence) were conducted within Mplus [63]--see Fig. 1.
The associations between adolescent risk factors and
adult involvement with alcohol were modeled in three
separate models, one for 30-day alcohol use, one for
heavy drinking and one for symptoms of alcohol abuse
and dependence (two separate outcomes, modeled in
same set of analyses). Within each of the three models,
the adolescent risk factors were entered simultaneously
as predictors of the adult alcohol problem behavior of
focus; thus, the path coefficient for each risk factor repre-
sents the unique effect of each risk factor after account-
ing for the effects of each other risk factor. Given the
relatively large sample sizes used, only results significant
at the level of P < 0.01 are reported.
In order to determine: (i) if the strength of association
between adolescent risk factors at age 18 and adult
alcohol problems at ages 22, 26 and 35 remained stable
over time; and (ii) whether the associations between ado-
lescent risk factors at age 18 and adult alcohol problems
at ages 22, 26 and 35 varied across gender and cohort,
we conducted a series of model comparisons. Because
these analyses involved models in which no variables
were latent (i.e. path models) the baseline model, for
which all associations were free to vary across time and
gender, had a c2 value of 0 as well as 0 degrees of
freedom. Comparing each constrained model to the base-
line model via a standard c2 difference test remains
appropriate in this situation [67].
The model comparisons assessing the extent of stabil-
ity across time and the impact of gender were conducted
by estimating a series of multivariate models using stan-
dard multiple-group analyses. In the baseline model,
associations between the adolescent risk factors and the
adult alcohol outcome were free to vary across age of
outcome and across gender. In the next multivariate
model, the association between one adolescent risk factor
and alcohol outcome was constrained to be equal across
all ages and both genders. In models where these con-
straints had no significant effect on model fit the con-
straints were retained. If the c2 of the constrained model
was significantly different from the baseline model, then
two additional models were estimated: one in which asso-
ciations were constrained across age of outcome but free
to vary across gender, and one in which associations
were free to vary across age of outcome but constrained
across gender. If the constraints imposed in either of
these models had no significant effect on model fit then
the constraints were retained. If, for a given adolescent
risk factor, no constraints could be made without affect-
ing the fit significantly, then all associations involving
that adolescent risk factor remained free in the final
model. Next, while still focusing upon the same adult
alcohol outcome, we switched focus to a different adoles-
cent risk factor and repeated the above series of model
comparisons. This pattern of analyses continued until all
the associations between the set of adolescent risk factors
and the adult alcohol outcome of focus were examined.
This process was completed for each model: 30-day

drinking, heavy drinking and symptoms of alcohol abuse
and dependence.
In a final set of analyses, we examined whether the
path coefficients in each model varied as a function of
cohort.The 11 senior year cohorts used in this study were
divided into three groups: 1976­79, 1980­83 and
1984­86. For each model (i.e. 30-day drinking, heavy
drinking and symptoms of abuse and dependence), a
cohort model was estimated in which the constraints
from the final models were retained, but allowed to vary
across the three cohort groups. Then additional equality
constraints across cohort groups were added to all
parameters.
RESULTS
Preliminary results: correlations
Table 3 describes the correlations among the adolescent
risk and protective factors, with the correlations shown
above the diagonal for men and below the diagonal for
women. As shown, the associations between the sub-
stance use indicators were moderate to large. In addition,
both measures of age 18 alcohol use correlated moder-
ately with many of the adolescent risk factors. Further,
the intercorrelations among the adolescent risk factors
ranged from small to moderate. In particular, parental
education and high-school grades were associated posi-
tively with college plans, while truancy was associated
negatively with college plans. In addition, truancy was
associated positively with evenings out, aggression and
theft/property damage, while evenings out was itself
associated positively with aggression and theft/property
damage. The intercorrelations between the problem
behaviors of risk taking, aggression and theft/property
damage were also moderate. Finally, the intercorrelation
between self-esteem and depressive affect was both nega-
tive and significant.
Correlations between the adolescent risk and protec-
tive factors and alcohol outcomes are presented sepa-
rately by gender and age of outcome in Tables 4 and 5. As
presented in these tables, higher levels of alcohol use
were associated generally with being white, higher parent
education, higher parental drinking, lower religious
attendance, higher truancy, frequency of evenings out
for fun and recreation, risk-taking, aggression, theft/
property damage and high school use of cigarettes, mari-
juana and other drugs. There are a few variables for
which the associations with alcohol use varied across
time, outcome and gender. For example, parental educa-
tion was associated with higher 30-day alcohol use for
both men and women across time, but its positive asso-
ciation with binge drinking for men decreased over time.
Although depressive affect was not associated with heavy
drinking and was associated negatively with 30-day
drinking (for women at ages 26 and 35), respondents
with high depressive affect in high school reported more
symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence at age 35.

Models predicting 30-day alcohol use

with R-square values of 0.25, 0.12 and 0.09 among men
and 0.24, 0.12 and 0.11 among women (at ages 22, 26
and 35, respectively). As shown in Table 6, being white
and having more educated parents predicted 30-day
drinking at each age (although the association decreased
in magnitude across age) and the associations were the
same for men and women. Parental drinking, truancy,
risk-taking and low depressive affect significantly pre-
dicted higher 30-day drinking and the strength of these
associations did not vary with age of outcome or gender.
College plans predicted higher 30-day drinking, but the
strength of this association varied with both age and
gender, increasing in strength over time for men. Eve-
nings out during high school predicted 30-day alcohol
use for both men and women, but only at age 22. Age 18
30-day alcohol use predicted later 30-day alcohol use,
with associations diminishing over time, but invariant
across gender. [To assess the impact of autoregressive
effects on model coefficients, additional models excluding
age 18 alcohol use were tested for each alcohol use
outcome (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy drinking and
AUD symptoms). Generally speaking, the substantive
findings were similar to those presented in this paper.
Where there were differences, the effects of adolescent
risk factors on later alcohol use were generally larger
when age 18 alcohol use was excluded. In particular, the
effects of age 18 parental education, truancy and mari-
juana use on later alcohol outcomes were more pro-
nounced.] Marijuana use also predicted 30-day drinking,
with associations being stronger for men than for women
at ages 22 and 26. Based on these multivariate models,
several adolescent risk factors that were correlated sig-
nificantly with 30-day drinking--including religious
attendance, aggression, theft/property damage, cigarette
use and other illicit drug use--were not significant pre-
dictors of 30-day drinking at any age; also living in a
single-parent home, high school grades and self-esteem
were not significant predictors (or correlates) of 30-day
drinking at any age (and these non-significant associa-
tions were able to be constrained equally across age of
outcome and gender).

predicted more heavy drinking across all ages of
outcome, and in fact it increased in magnitude across the
ages. Higher high school grades predicted less heavy
drinking at all ages, with coefficients being invariant
across ages and gender. College plans in high school pre-
dicted more heavy drinking at age 22 but less heavy
drinking at age 35 (coefficients invariant across gender).
Higher frequency of evenings out, risk-taking and
smoking predicted higher levels of heavy drinking, with
each of these associations being invariant across age of
outcome and gender. Lower self-esteem and lower depres-
sive affect predicted more heavy drinking (invariant
across age and gender); given that the associated zero-
order correlations are non-significant, the predictive
effects may be model-dependent. Age 18 heavy drinking
predicted later heavy drinking, but this association was
stronger for men than for women and decreased in
strength over time. [To assess the impact of autoregres-

Adolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 93

sive effects on model coefficients, additional models
excluding age 18 alcohol use were tested for each alcohol
use outcome (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy drinking, and
AUD symptoms). Generally speaking, the substantive
findings were similar to those presented in this paper.
Where there were differences, the effects of adolescent
risk factors on later alcohol use were generally larger
when age 18 alcohol use was excluded. In particular,
the effects of age 18 parental education, truancy and
marijuana use on later alcohol outcomes were more
pronounced.] Similarly, although marijuana use signifi-
cantly predicted adult heavy drinking, the association
weakened with age. Despite being correlated significantly
with adult heavy drinking, religious attendance, truancy,
aggression, theft/property damage and use of illicit drugs
other than marijuana did not predict significantly adult
heavy drinking in these multivariate analyses; living in a
single-parent home was also a non-significant predictor
(these associations were invariant across age of outcome
and gender).
Models predicting symptoms of abuse and dependence
Another series of model comparisons resulted in a
final model for symptoms of abuse and dependence
(c2
(29, n = 21 137)
= 46.699, P = 0.02, RMSEA = 0.008,
SRMR = 0.007) in which R-square values were 0.12 and
0.09 for men's abuse and dependence symptoms, respec-
tively; and 0.12 and 0.10 for women's abuse and depen-
dence symptoms, respectively.
As shown in Table 8, symptoms of alcohol abuse and
symptoms of dependence were predicted significantly by
higher parental drinking, higher truancy, theft/property
damage, cigarette use, age 18 heavy drinking, marijuana
use and other illicit drug use. [To assess the impact of
autoregressive effects on model coefficients, additional
models excluding age 18 alcohol use were tested for each
alcohol use outcome (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy
drinking and AUD symptoms). Generally speaking, the
substantive findings were similar to those presented in
this paper. Where there were differences, the effects of
adolescent risk factors on later alcohol use were generally
larger when age 18 alcohol use was excluded. In particu-
lar, the effects of age 18 parental education, truancy and
marijuana use on later alcohol outcomes were more pro-
nounced.] Most of these associations were invariant
across gender, although parental drinking was a stronger
predictor of abuse symptoms for men, theft/property
damage was a stronger predictor of abuse symptoms for
women and marijuana use was a stronger predictor of
both abuse and dependence symptoms for men than for
women. Aggression predicted fewer symptoms of alcohol
dependence, but the zero-order correlation was non-
significant; aggression did not predict abuse symptoms
(but was correlated positively). Despite being correlated
consistently with both abuse and dependence symptoms
at age 35, age 18 religious attendance, grades, college
plans, evenings out, risk-taking, theft/property damage
and depressive affect did not predict abuse or dependence
symptoms significantly in the multivariate models.
Finally, being white, parent education and living in a
single-parent home did not predict significantly later
abuse and dependence for either men or women.
Cohort invariance
Overall, we found no significant cohort variation. In
taking the final models (as described above) and adding
constraints across the three cohort groups, we found that
the cohort constrained models were not significantly dif-
ferent (at an alpha of 0.01, as explained above) from
the final model for 30-day drinking, Dc2

= 86.412, P = 0.03 or

findings indicate that the associations between adoles-
cent predictors and later alcohol involvement are invari-
ant across cohorts.
DISCUSSION
Advances in the understanding of substance use etiology
can be made by viewing alcohol and other drug use, and
addiction in general, from a life-span development per-
spective. There are many reasons to expect connections

between adolescent and adult functioning, such that
adult alcohol abuse follows in a cascading manner from
adolescent difficulties; at the same time, the normative-
ness of substance use and externalizing behaviors during
adolescence may make it difficult to predict from this age
period to adult functioning [13,68]. Addressing such
questions about the predictability of adolescent charac-
teristics and experiences on adult substance abuse has
been difficult, given the scarcity of long-term prospective
studies. Thus the present study, in conjunction with the
other papers in this supplemental issue [69­75], offers a
needed perspective on life-span linkages of addiction.
This study shows that risk factors measured at age 18
can be useful in predicting alcohol use, heavy drinking
and symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependency to age
35. The findings regarding the lack of cohort variation in
the magnitude and patterns of predictors provides strong
evidence that the identified risk factors were not given
to historical variation during the period of this study,
and reflect robust developmental linkages (rather than
cohort-specific ones). Among the background character-
istics found to predict later drinking, being white was
associated with 30-day drinking through age 35, but was
associated with heavy drinking only at age 22 and was
unassociated with symptoms of abuse or dependence at
age 35.This decrease in racial/ethnic differences with age
is consistent with other research [20], and suggests that
future research should examine the associations between
alcohol use and its predictors separately by racial/ethnic
group. Parental education was a risk factor for 30-day
alcohol use at all ages and heavy drinking at age 22, but
was not associated with symptoms of abuse or depen-
dence. As expected, parental drinking was a risk factor for
all alcohol outcomes across all points of measurement,
and in fact increased in predictive power over time for
heavy drinking; it was generally a stronger predictor for
men than for women. These findings are consistent with
previous research [27] suggesting greater heritability for
AUDs among males than among females.
High school grades were protective against heavy
drinking but unassociated with 30-day drinking or symp-
toms of abuse or dependence, perhaps reflecting previ-
ously documented associations between intelligence and
light drinking [76] or the effects of school success and
institutional identification as protective factors [29,30].
College plans predicted more heavy drinking at age 22
but less heavy drinking at age 35, suggesting the differ-
ential college-based course of heavy drinking across
adulthood; it is equally interesting that college plans pre-
dicted greater 30-day drinking at all ages, but was unre-
lated to alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms at age
35.These associations suggest that although respondents
who attended college drank more heavily during their
college years, they were not at greater risk for AUDs than
others, a finding consistent with other studies [77,78].
That college attendance was a short-term risk factor for
alcohol use and abuse is worrisome, none the less, and
suggests the utility of studies aimed at identifying char-
acteristics that differentiate desisters from those who
experience long-term alcohol problems [12].
As expected, indices of adolescent risk-taking and
externalizing behaviors were all correlated positively with
adult alcohol use, heavy drinking and AUD symptoms.
However, based on the multivariate models, there were
some notable inconsistencies in the pattern of these pre-
dictors that suggest different pathways to adult use
and abuse [79]. Risk-taking predicted consistently both
30-day alcohol use and heavy drinking, but did not
predict age 35 AUD symptoms, suggesting that risk-
taking is associated more with use (even heavy use) than
with abuse or dependence symptoms.Truancy was a con-
sistent predictor of 30-day alcohol use, but not of heavy
drinking, and it predicted abuse and dependence symp-
toms; this suggests that truancy in high school may
reflect problems that manifest later as AUDs. The findings
that aggression did not predict either 30-day drinking or
heavy drinking at all (and was related inconsistently to
abuse and dependence symptoms) are consistent with
the argument that aggression during late adolescence
reflects a mix of ongoing and developmentally limited
externalizing behaviors, and thus may be of little value in
predicting later difficulties at the population level [46].
Similarly, theft/property damage did not predict 30-day
or heavy drinking significantly at any age. Interestingly,
theft/property damage was a particularly important pre-
dictor of both abuse and dependence symptoms, with a
gender difference indicating a stronger association with
abuse (but not dependence) symptoms for women than
for men. Further research is needed to investigate
whether the more normative nature of theft or property
damage among male adolescents contributes to the
gender difference. Of course, because all these indices
were included together, it is likely that some of the incon-
sistencies were due to some `competition' among the pre-
dictors, suggesting appropriate caution in interpreting
these findings.
Higher depressive affect in high school predicted lower
adult 30-day alcohol use and heavy drinking (but not age
35 AUD symptoms), suggesting the social aspect of much
of adult drinking, consistent with findings that loneliness
serves a protective function against heavy drinking [30].
Similarly, evenings out with friends in high school pre-
dicted higher adult 30-day alcohol use and heavy drink-
ing, but not age 35 AUD symptoms. The lack of a strong
association between adolescent depressive affect and
symptoms of AUDs in middle adulthood in this study
may reflect limitations of our depressive affect measure
(e.g. the absence of somatic symptoms and the focus on

self-derogation) or the presence of complex non-linear
associations between high school mental health and later
alcohol use and abuse [80­82].
High school use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana
were risk factors for all adult drinking measures, although
adolescent drinking and marijuana use were better pre-
dictors of later heavy drinking for men than for women.
Whether these associations reflect an individual's pheno-
typic tendency toward substance use [83] or similarity of
riskfactorsacrossmultiplesubstances[84],theirstrength
highlights the importance of identifying and intervening
with adolescent polydrug users in an effort to reduce adult
alcohol and other drug use problems.
The associations between many of the risk and protec-
tive factors and later alcohol use were largely stable
across gender and age of outcome. This was true for
parental education, truancy, risk-taking and depressive
affect as predictors of 30-day drinking and for grades,
evenings out, risk-taking, self-esteem, depressive affect
and cigarette use as predictors of heavy drinking. Other
significant associations varied by age of outcome, gender
or both. These include being white, parental education
(as a predictor of heavy drinking), college plans, age 18
drinking and marijuana use. Coming from a single-
parent home was the only risk factor included in this
study that was found to have no significant association
with alcohol use when entered into a multivariate analy-
sis. This suggests that the association between living with
a single parent and alcohol use may be limited to the
adolescent period [21­23]. Overall, although effects were
typically small and much variance remains unaccounted
for, the ability of adolescent predictors to account signifi-
cantly for alcohol use and abuse up to 17 years later
shows that despite the multitude of more developmen-
tally proximal influences on adult alcohol use and abuse,
adolescent risk factors remain important.
Strengths and limitations
This study is unique in its use of both US national multi-
cohort long-term longitudinal data and four different
alcohol outcomes. In particular, by using national data
from 11 different cohorts (thus essentially providing 11
national studies spanning senior year cohorts 1976­86),
we were able to test whether there were important his-
torical variations in the relationships. That there were no
such variations demonstrates the robustness of the find-
ings and argues further that we are tapping into
developmental/age effects rather than cohort or secular
trend effects across this historical period. One important
limitation to our sample is that by starting with high
school seniors we missed high school dropouts, repre-
senting about 15% of the population. Other analyses in a
separate MTF study that included dropouts [29] indicate
that many of the relationships found here would have
been stronger, suggesting that our findings reflect lower-
bound estimates. In general, we cover a wide range of
adolescent characteristics and experiences, but not all rel-
evant aspects of adolescence; similarly, in terms of mea-
sures, ours do not always provide in-depth considerations
of relevant constructs. Because the assessments for this
study began during the respondents' late adolescence, it is
difficult to distinguish between those respondents whose
problem behaviors began in adolescence and those whose
problem behaviors had an earlier onset in childhood or
early adolescence. Distinguishing these two groups could
be important when we use adolescent problem behaviors
as predictors of later alcohol use. Previous research has
indicated differing outcomes among individuals with life-
course persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial
behaviors [45,46]. Building on our analyses, future
efforts should be aimed at processes and mechanisms that
connect adolescent risk factors to later outcomes, focus-
ing upon adult characteristics and experiences that serve
to mediate and moderate long-term linkages.
CONCLUSION
Alcohol use disorders across adulthood are among the
strongest predictors of morbidity and mortality [85,86],
and a better understanding of their developmental ante-
cedents can facilitate efforts to diminish their negative
influence on individuals, families and communities. This
study shows that many predictors of alcohol use mea-
sured during adolescence retain their predictive value
throughout young adulthood and into early mid-life.
Adolescence is marked by rapid change, exploration and
behavior that is often risky. Many individuals move
beyond the unsafe behaviors of their teenage years, but
the choices made during adolescence can set in motion
behaviors and experiences that contribute to adult func-
tioning and adjustment [87].
