Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to assess the complication and diagnostic rates of
computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle biopsy of pulmonary parenchymal and
mediastinal lesions.
Methods: Patients who were suspected to have a malignancy based on chest imaging and CTand
could not be otherwise diagnosed were evaluated.
Results: Sixty-five patients were included; 48 (73.8%) were male and 17 (26.2%) were female. Their
average age was 58 years. The lesion size ranged from 11 to 105 mm. The most common specific
histologic subtype was adenocarcinoma, and the least common was lymphoma. The diagnostic rate
was 90.8%. The mean complication rate was 15.4%. Statistically significant associations were found
between the complication rate and needle size and between the needle path length and lesion size.
Conclusion: CT-guided needle biopsy is an effective diagnostic method for patients with
mediastinal and parenchymal lesions before thoracotomy. This method can also reliably
differentiate benign and malignant tumors.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most common
causes of cancer-related death among all
types of cancer worldwide.1 Therefore, sus-
pected lesions should be accurately diag-
nosed and optimal treatment planned as
soon as possible. Most lung malignancies
can be confidently diagnosed with accurate
histopathological identification.2
Intrathoracic lesions are common and
often difficult to diagnose. Many diagnostic
techniques are used for pulmonary and
mediastinal lesions, including washing and
brushing cytology, transbronchial biopsy,
transthoracic biopsy, thoracoscopy, medias-
tinoscopy, and thoracotomy. Although
many of these techniques are invasive, they
remain necessary to achieve an accurate
histopathological diagnosis.3,4 Of these
diagnostic techniques, percutaneous trans-
thoracic biopsy is performed using either
cutting needle biopsy (CNB) or fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB).5
FNAB is used for cytological examin-
ation of aspirated material. CNB is used to
obtain tissue fragments from the lesion for
histopathological diagnosis.4 Because a
piece of tissue is taken via a cutting needle,
this method is especially useful for diagnosis
of suspicious malignant or benign and
lymphoproliferative diseases. Additionally,
it is generally more accurate than aspiration.
This technique is frequently used for chest
wall lesions or peripheral lesions that do not
require parenchymal passage.6 The diagnos-
tic value of percutaneous transthoracic
needle biopsy (TTNB) for malignant dis-
eases ranges from 77% to 99%, and its
sensitivity is excellent.7
Historically, radiologists developed
lesion biopsy techniques using guidance
with fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, and
computed tomography (CT), contributing
to optimal surgical and medical manage-
ment.7 Using CT-guided TTNB, lesions in
the lung parenchyma and mediastinum that
are not reachable by bronchoscopy can be
distinguished, and a specific diagnosis can be
made with high accuracy. Thus, unnecessary
performance of thoracotomy to obtain a
histological diagnosis can be avoided.6 CT-
guided TTNB allows the practitioner to
safely avoid vascular and cardiac structures
when sampling almost all lesions. CT-guided
TTNB is an easy technique that induces less
trauma than thoracotomic biopsy tech-
niques.8 The complication and diagnostic
rates of CT-guided TTNB are affected by
many factors, including the needle depth,
needle size, and distance from the lesion to
the pleura.9
The purpose of this study was to investi-
gate the technique, suitability, and factors
influencing the diagnostic and complication
rates of CT-guided TTNB of lung masses.
Materials and methods
In this retrospective study, we assessed
65 patients who underwent CT-guided lung
biopsy using a fine needle and a cutting needle.
The diagnostic studies were performed dur-
ing a 4-year period in the Department of
Radiology, Ankara Numune Training and
Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. This
study was approved by the ethics committee
of the same institute. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients.
Patients who were suspected to have
malignant lesions on CT images and chest
radiographs that were unspecified by other
methods were evaluated. TTNB was per-
formed under CT guidance. We used a CT
Scanner (Hitachi Radix Turbo Model;
Hitachi Medical, Tokyo, Japan) to guide
the needle and locate the lesion.
Patients with significant coagulopathy,
contralateral pneumonectomy, bullous dis-
ease adjacent to the suspicious lesion, pul-
monary arterial hypertension, and advanced
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
excluded from the study.
The CT images were evaluated before the
procedure, and the patient was positioned
Go

based on these images to provide the safest
distance from the skin surface to the lesion.
Each patient was informed about the pro-
cedure and was asked to maintain the initial
position during the procedure. A metal
marker was then used to indicate the esti-
mated lesion area according to the scanned
images, and this area was rescanned using a
5-mm slice thickness for confirmation. The
depth of the lesion and the angle of needle
entrance were calculated. The selected sec-
tion was marked on the patient. The upper
side of the costal margin was used for needle
entrance to protect the neural and arterial
structures. The skin was cleaned, and sub-
cutaneous and intradermal anesthesia was
performed with 2% prilocaine (Citanest;
Dentsply, York, PA). We used 20-cm-long,
22-gauge Franseen lung biopsy needles
(Cook Medical, Inc., Bloomington, IN) for
the aspiration biopsies and 15-cm-long, 18-
gauge Franseen biopsy needles (Cook
Medical, Inc.) for the cutting biopsies. The
patient was told to hold his or her breath, and
the needle was lowered to the specified depth
after ensuring that no deviations due to
patient motion had taken place. The patient
was then told to take superficial breaths, and
several control scans were taken from that
area. After ensuring that the needle tip was in
the lesion, the mandrel of the needle was
removed. The needle was wiggled within the
lesion to free it, and aspiration was then
performed. When we judged that enough
material had been obtained, the needle and
injector were withdrawn. Both hands were
used for this procedure to terminate the
negative pressure. The puncture site was
covered with sterile gauze. The aspirate of
FNAB was sprayed to lam, and the tissue
specimen of CNB was placed into 10%
formalin solution and sent out for pathologi-
cal examination. A single entry was per-
formed to reduce the complication rate.
Upon completion of the biopsy, the
patient was examined by CT for rule out
pneumothorax and hemorrhage. The patient
was then sent to the clinics for further
follow-up.
Histopathologic results from all biopsies
were classified as (1) malignant with subtype
determination, (2) malignant without sub-
type determination, (3) specified benign, (4)
nonspecified benign, and (5) nondiagnostic
(Table 1).
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics, history, histo-
pathologic diagnoses, complication rates,
and radiologic data were recorded for all
patients. Pearson's chi-square test was used
to assess the data. The results are reported as
either percentage or mean Æ standard devi-
ation. A P value of < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
In total, 49 lesions in 65 patients underwent
CT-guided transthoracic FNAB, and the
remaining 16 lesions underwent CT-guided
transthoracic CNB. Lesion access was
achieved at the first needle pass in all cases.
Of the 65 patients, 48 (73.8%) were male and
17 (26.2%) were female. The patient age
ranged from 20 to 80 years for male patients
and from 11 to 78 years for female patients.
The median age was 58 years (65.4 Æ 10.7
years).
The mean lesion size was 36 mm (range,
11­105 mm; 54 Æ 19 mm). The mean dis-
tance from the margin of the lesion to the
pleural surface was 21 mm (range, 0­53 mm;
23 Æ 12 mm). The mean distance from the
skin to the center of the lesion (needle
path length) was 48 mm (range, 0­91 mm;
53 Æ 21 mm).
The histopathologic results from all
biopsies were classified into the five above-
mentioned groups (Table 1). Table 1 also
shows the percentage of lesions in each
group according to the histopathological
subtype. The histopathological diagnoses
810 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
were defined in 59 of 65 (90.8%) patients:
72.4% had malignant lesions and 18.4% had
benign lesions. In six patients, histopatho-
logical analysis was not informative because
of inadequate samples. The histopatho-
logical results in patients with malignancies
included non-small cell carcinoma and
malignant epithelial lesions (21.6%), lung
adenocarcinoma (16.9%), squamous cell
carcinoma (12.3%), metastatic disease
(10.8%), small cell carcinoma (6.2%),
lymphoma (3.1%), and pleomorphic carcin-
oma (1.5%).
Statistically significant associations were
observed between the complication rate and
lesion size (p < 0.05), needle path length
(p < 0.05), and type of biopsy procedure
(p < 0.05). No significant association was
found between the distance from the lesion
to the pleura and the complication rate. The
following four factors also showed no sig-
nificant association with the diagnostic rate:
needle size, lesion size, distance from lesion
to pleura, and needle path length (Table 2).
Post-procedure pneumothorax developed
in 10 (15.4%) of all 65 patients as shown by
the CT examination performed after the
biopsy. None of these patients required
chest tube placement. Pneumothorax
occurred in 4 (6.2%) of all 65 patients as
shown by the post-biopsy chest X-ray taken
3 hours later. Minor intraparenchymal
bleeding occurred in 7 (10.8%) patients as
shown by CT after the procedure. No hem-
optysis or hemothorax was seen.
Discussion
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in
men and the second most common cancer in
women that causes mortality.1 Therefore,
suspected lesions should be diagnosed as
soon as possible. When a lesion is seen in the
lung, the first step is to determine whether

the mass is benign or malignant. Microbial
analyses and histopathologic specimens
should provide the final diagnosis, regard-
less of whether a mass is considered malig-
nant or benign based on chest imaging as
your proposal. Many methods have been
described for diagnostic sampling of
intrathoracic lesions.9,10 Of these, the sensi-
tivity of bronchoscopy and transbronchial
biopsy are high for endobronchial lesions
and low for peripheral lung lesions. For
pulmonary nodules, CT-guided needle
biopsy is an effective technique with which
to confirm the pathological diagnosis. This
technique has been analyzed with respect to
factors that affect its diagnostic and compli-
cation rates.10,11
The indications for CT-guided TTNB
include consolidation, abscesses, mass
lesions, pulmonary nodules, pleural lesions,
and hilar and mediastinal masses that
cannot be definitively diagnosed by sputum
cytology or bronchoscopy.12 In current
practice, CT-guided TTNB is the gold
standard method for the diagnosis of
intrathoracic lesions. Easy and rapid appli-
cation and the lack of a requirement for
general anesthesia are the main advantages
of CT-guided TTNB over bronchoscopy
and video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy.13
The reported accuracy rate of CT-guided
TTNB varies from 77% to 99%.14 In the
present study, the diagnostic rate of CT-
guided TTNB was 90.8% (72.4% for malig-
nant lesions, 18.4% for benign lesions).
Diagnosis was successful in 59 of 65
patients. A specific result could not be
achieved in all patients who underwent
CT-guided FNAB (43/49, 87.8%), whereas
a specific histopathologic diagnosis was
obtained in all CT-guided CNB procedures
(16/16, 100.0%). This result is similar to the
findings reported in previous publications.
However, this difference was not statistically
significant in the present study.
Loubeyre et al.15 studied 75 patients and
reported that a specific histopathological
diagnosis with a low complication rate
could be achieved with CT-guided CNB.
Wallace et al.16 examined the efficacy of
CT-guided FNAB for 1.0-cm pulmonary
lesions. CT-guided transthoracic FNAB was
applied to 61 cases with a <1-cm lesion on
CT. The diagnostic rate was 77% (52% for
malignant lesions and 25% for benign
lesions). In another study, 296 patients
underwent core biopsy, FNAB, or both for
lung lesions. FNAB was diagnostically help-
ful in 91.7% and core biopsy in 87.8% of
patients in the malignant group. This rate
increased to 96.6% when the two methods
were combined.17
The present study included 48 (73.8%)
men and 17 (26.2%) women; the male:fe-
male ratio was 2.8:1.0. This particular ratio
occurred because malignant pulmonary

lesions are seen more commonly in males
than in females. This is also consistent with
the literature.
Malignant histopathological diagnoses
included non-small cell carcinoma and malig-
nant epithelial lesions (21.6%), lung adeno-
carcinoma (16.9%), squamous cell carcinoma
(12.3%), metastatic disease (10.8%), small
cell carcinoma (6.2%), lymphoma (3.1%),
and pleomorphic carcinoma (1.5%). The
histologic distribution of lung cancers has
changed throughout the years. In past dec-
ades, epidermoid carcinoma constituted 50%
of lung cancers, and this rate is now lower.
Conversely, the proportion of adenocarcin-
omas has increased, whereas that of small cell
cancers has decreased.4 In the present study,
the most common specific histologic subtype
was adenocarcinoma and the least common
was lymphoma. These findings are consistent
with some studies performed by other
authors.4,5,11,18
A statistically significant relationship was
found between the complication rate and
lesion size (p < 0.05), needle path length
(p < 0.05), and type of biopsy procedure
(p < 0.05). Pneumothorax was the most
common complication, but the rate of this
complication (15.4%) is within the accept-
able level and is even low according to the
range reported in the literature (9.0%­
59.6%).19,20 A main consideration of lung
biopsy-associated pneumothorax is whether
it is pleural or non-pleural. Aribas¸ et al.21
found that the lesion depth was a poor
predictor of pneumothorax. Accordingly, in
previous series of CT-guided biopsy in the
literature, pleural lesions were associated
with a very low incidence of pneumothorax;
as soon as the aerated lung was traversed,
the risk rose considerably. However,
the exact depth of the lesion was not a
significant factor. In the present study,
we found that the depth of the lesion,
rather than whether the lesion was pleural
or non-pleural, was a significant risk factor
for complications.
The next most common complication
was minor intraparenchymal hemorrhage
(6.2%). None of the patients required
chest tube insertion. No hemoptysis or
hemothorax occurred. The low rate of
pneumothorax in the present study might
have been related to the single entry, the
choice of different types of needles according
to the size and location of the lesion, and the
fact that the patients held their breath and
avoided coughing. All patients underwent
non-contrast CT scans immediately after the
needle was removed, followed by a chest
X-ray 3 hours later. If air was seen in the
pleural space, pneumothorax was diag-
nosed. Some authors have reported lower
complication rates in association with CNB
and higher complication rates in association
with FNAB, while others have reported the
reverse situation.17 Topal and Berkman18
found that the rate of pneumothorax was
not affected by the needle size in their
retrospective study of 284 cases. Anderson
et al.9 reported a 15.9% rate of pneumo-
thorax when performing CNB and 35.1%
when performing FNAB. However, some
studies have revealed higher rates of
pneumothorax with larger needle diam-
eters.22 We used 22-gauge, 20-cm Franseen
lung biopsy needles for the FNAB and 18-
gauge, 15-cm Franseen biopsy needles for
the CNB. A statistically significant relation-
ship was found between the needle size and
complication rate. The distance from the
lesion to the pleura was not significantly
associated with the complication rate.
The following four factors also had no
significant effect on the diagnostic rate:
needle size, lesion size, distance from lesion
to pleura, and needle path length. There is a
consensus in the literature regarding the use
of 18-gauge cutting needles for outlying
lesions and 20-gauge needles for deeper
lesions.23,24
Overall, the diagnostic yield in our study
was 90.8%. The diagnostic and complication
rates were found to be consistent with the
Go

results reported in the literature. Limitations
of this study include the retrospective study
design, low number of patients, and low
number of evaluated parameters. It is evident
that CT-guided TTNB is a reliable method
with a low complication rate and high diag-
nostic rate for lesions that cannot be diag-
nosed by clinical and radiologic methods.
CT-guided TTNB is also highly sensitive for
differentiation between malignant and benign
lung masses, and it reduces the need for more
invasive procedures. We believe that its
accuracy will further increase for early thor-
acic lesions because of continued advances in
CT technology and increased experience of
radiologists and cytopathologists.
