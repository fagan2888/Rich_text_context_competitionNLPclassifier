Double-blind trials in hyperbaric
medicine: A narrative review on past
experiences and considerations in
designing sham hyperbaric treatment
Nina CA Lansdorp and Rob A van Hulst
Abstract
Background: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which consists of breathing 100% oxygen under a higher atmospheric pres-
sure than normal, is utilized worldwide in the treatment of several diseases. With the growing demand for evidence-
based research, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been criticized for delivering too little high-quality research, mainly in the
form of randomized controlled trials. While not always indispensable, the addition of a sham-controlled group to such a
trial can contribute to the quality of the research. However, the design of a sham (hyperbaric) treatment is associated
with several considerations regarding adequate blinding and the use of pressure and oxygen. This narrative review dis-
cusses information on the sham profile and the blinding and safety of double-blind trials in hyperbaric medicine, irrespec-
tive of the indication for treatment.
Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched for sham-controlled trials on hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
The control treatment was considered sham if patients were blinded to their allocation and treatment took place in a
hyperbaric chamber, with no restrictions regarding pressurization, oxygen levels or indication. Studies involving children
or only one session of hyperbaric oxygen were excluded. Information on (the choice of) treatment profile, blinding mea-
sures, patient's perception regarding allocation and safety issues was extracted from eligible studies.
Results: A total of 42 eligible trials were included. The main strategies for sham treatment were (1) use of a lower pres-
sure than that of the hyperbaric oxygen group, while breathing 21% oxygen; (2) use of the same pressure as the hyperba-
ric oxygen group, while breathing an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and (3) use of the same pressure as the hyperbaric
oxygen group, while breathing 21% oxygen. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are discussed using the
information provided by the trials.
Conclusion: Based on this review, using a lower pressure than the hyperbaric oxygen group while breathing 21% oxy-
gen best matches the inertness of the placebo. Although studies show that use of a lower pressure does allow adequate
blinding, this is associated with more practical issues than with the other strategies. The choice of which sham profile to
use requires careful consideration; moreover, to ensure proper performance, a clear and detailed protocol is also
required.

on hyperbaric medicine, lists 14 indications for HBO
therapy. These include late radiation tissue injuries, dia-
betic foot ulcers and carbon monoxide poisoning.1
Treatment for chronic problems (e.g. wound healing)
usually involves giving daily sessions for several weeks,
at pressures between 2.0 and 2.5 ATA. These sessions
can be given in either a monoplace chamber (in which
only one patient is treated per session) or in a multi-
place chamber (where several patients are treated simul-
taneously, with the possibility of an attendant joining
them to supervise treatment). The therapy is generally
considered safe with few complications, with baro-
trauma of the ears or sinuses and transient myopia
being the most common.2
HBO therapy has been controversial from the start.
For example, in 1987, Gabb et al.3 stated in Chest that
HBO was ``... a therapy in search of diseases.'' The cur-
rently available scientific research is still criticized.
Although the theoretical basis for the use of HBO ther-
apy seems rational, and well-performed studies in
animals and humans show positive effects, a large pro-
portion of the evidence is anecdotal, retrospective,
uncontrolled and underpowered. The increased appli-
cation of evidence-based medicine has raised concerns
about the overtreatment of patients, possibly causing
unnecessary risks and higher costs in health
care. Despite efforts by the Undersea and Hyperbaric
Medical Society and (recently) the European
Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine to establish recog-
nized clinical indications, a need still exists for more
and better research, particularly in the form of rando-
mized controlled trials.4 Because the outcome of such a
trial can be biased by a placebo effect (especially in the
case of subjective parameters), a sham treatment for
the control group can be a valuable addition.
However, the design of such a trial is associated with
several considerations regarding the sham treatment.
The goal of a sham treatment is to ensure that patients
and investigators are unable to distinguish sham from
actual HBO therapy (thus filtering out a potential pla-
cebo effect), while the sham procedure must not have
any effect on the disease being treated. Because patients
have to auto-inflate their ears when pressure is
increased in HBO therapy, sham therapy also has to
use pressure to create/mimic this experience. However,
every increase in pressure has an effect on the partial
pressures of gases, potentially causing the sham treat-
ment to become an active agent.
This dilemma, together with considerations regard-
ing practicality, safety and blinding, has resulted in dif-
ferent strategies being used in various trials over the
years, each with their own advantages and disadvan-
tages. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a
structured overview of all past randomized controlled
trials that included sham (hyperbaric) treatment. The
methodology is examined and, if available, the authors'
considerations for the choice and the results of this
methodology (regarding treatment profiles, blinding
and safety) are presented. The findings of this review
may help researchers to make a more balanced decision
regarding the design of their specific trial.
Being a narrative review on the methodology of
trials investigating hyperbaric medicine, there is no dis-
cussion on the indications for which HBO was applied,
or on the efficacy and/or outcome of each trial.
Methods
Our aim was to provide a summary of past studies
involving HBO therapy using a sham treatment. A sys-
tematic search of the literature was conducted using the
following protocol.
Eligibility criteria
Included were all studies comparing actual HBO ther-
apy with sham treatment, irrespective of the indication
for treatment. It was expected that most of these stud-
ies would be randomized, but if any non-randomized
controlled trial were encountered, these were also con-
sidered for inclusion. The control treatment was con-
sidered sham if no additional therapeutic effect to
standard care was intended, and patients were blinded
to their allocation. The minimum criterion for the
blinding of patients was that the patients were located
in a hyperbaric chamber (either monoplace or multi-
place) during sham treatment; no restrictions were
made regarding pressure or oxygen levels. Studies that
did not meet this criteria (e.g. if patients were allowed
to choose their own allocation, or if they received a gas
mixture in a normal room) were excluded. Studies on
children were excluded, because their treatment regi-
mens (generally using a lower pressure) and blinding
measures can differ from those applied in adults.
Studies with only one session of HBO were also
excluded, because that treatment regimen is dissimilar
to a typical hyperbaric treatment which (generally) con-
sists of multiple sessions, often administered over sev-
eral weeks.
Database search
MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase via Ovid and the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
searched (up to April 2017) for sham-controlled studies
on hyperbaric medicine. Medical subject heading
(MeSH and Emtree) terms were used, in combination
with keywords. Searches were limited to randomized
controlled trials and trials including human adults and
published in English. Details of the search strategies
are presented in Appendix 1.
Lansdorp and van Hulst 463
Other sources
The reference lists of the included studies and identified
(systematic) reviews were screened to identify additional
eligible studies. Also, the Database of Randomized
Controlled Trials in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine
was searched by hand for articles on HBO.
Data collection
Data collection was performed by the first author
(N.C.A.L.). Abstracts were screened for eligibility fol-
lowing the criteria mentioned above. After screening,
information on the study sample, and on the sham and
HBO profile (pressure, time, oxygen levels), was
extracted from the full-text article.
The full text was also searched for considerations
regarding the choice for a certain sham treatment pro-
file, for information on blinding procedures and for the
use of questionnaires on patients' perceived allocation.
Information on the safety of the sham procedure was
also collected, including details on any type of
complications.
Results
The search of the databases and other sources yielded
477 articles. After removal of duplicates (including sep-
arate articles reporting on the same trial) and initial
screening, 45 articles remained. After assessing the elig-
ibility based on the full-text articles, 42 studies were
finally included in the present review (Figure 1). All of
these studies were randomized controlled trials.
Of the 42 included studies, analysis of the sham pro-
files revealed the use of three main strategies. Presented
in chronological order as described in the literature,
these are (1) use of a lower pressure than the HBO
group, while breathing 21% oxygen; (2) use of the same
pressure as the HBO group, while breathing a mixture
with an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and (3) use of
the same pressure as the HBO group, while breathing
21% oxygen.
The first strategy was used in 23 studies, with pres-
sures in the sham group ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 ATA.
An overview of these studies including considerations
for the choice of profile, blinding measures and compli-
cations in the sham group as provided in the articles is
presented in Table 1. The second strategy, using an
adjusted percentage of oxygen for sham therapy while
maintaining the same pressure as the HBO group, was
used in 11 studies. Adjusted oxygen levels ranged from
7% to 41%. An overview is provided in Table 2. The
third and last strategy (use of the same pressure with
21% oxygen in the sham group) was used in eight stud-
ies, of which the information is presented in Table 3.
The advantages and disadvantages of all three
strategies, using the information provided in the arti-
cles, are discussed separately below.
Discussion
Sham treatment using lower pressure than the HBO
group while breathing 21% oxygen
The first documented trial that involved patient blind-
ing using a sham treatment was a study performed by
Hart et al.5 in 1974. In that study, patients were exposed
to either real HBO therapy (at 2.0 ATA) or to a sham
therapy consisting of breathing 21% oxygen (i.e. nor-
mal air) at a considerably lower pressure (1.1 ATA)
than the active treatment. The choice for this profile
was not explained by the authors.
The advantage of using only a slight increase in pres-
sure is that the partial pressure of oxygen also increases
only slightly. Normally, at atmospheric pressure
(1.0 ATA), 21% of the air consists of oxygen; this is
equal to a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.21 ATA. If
the atmospheric pressure is doubled to 2.0 ATA, the
partial pressure of oxygen also doubles to 0.42 ATA.
This is the equivalent of 42% oxygen under normal cir-
cumstances (i.e. 1.0 ATA).
In the study by Hart et al.,5 21% oxygen was used
under a pressure of 1.1 ATA. This is the equivalent of
breathing 23% oxygen under atmospheric pressure
and, therefore, minimizes the effect on the inertness of
the placebo. However, some claim that even a slight
increase in the partial pressure of oxygen, or the mere
use of pressure alone (irrespective of the partial pres-
sures of the gases), could inflict changes in the body
and interfere with the realization of an inert placebo.
Although a small number of animal and cell culture
studies support this claim, it is debatable whether these
results are substantial enough to be used as an argu-
ment for clinical practice.49,50
Following the trial by Hart et al.,5 concerns were
raised about the effectiveness of blinding, given that no
ear barotrauma occurred in the sham control group. If
the use of 1.1­1.3 ATA had resulted in patients having
to equalize their ears, one would also have expected
more reports of complications.
Using a lower pressure for the sham treatment
group has some practical implications related to blind-
ing. Apart from masking the gas mixture that is being
applied, care should also be taken to blind the interior/
exterior of the chamber to prevent gauges or other
devices being seen that might indicate the pressure. If
the chamber operator or hyperbaric physician is
unblinded, they should be instructed not to refer to the
pressure used when in close vicinity to the patients and
investigators and to use a percentage of pressure
(rather than the actual pressure) when communicating
with an (inside) chamber attendant. Using a different
pressure also requires a separate daily session,

preferably scheduled so that the two groups cannot
meet and compare experiences. The use of cluster or
block randomization can minimize the impact of these
precautions on daily practice. Additional practical mea-
sures used to prevent unblinding in these trials are pre-
sented in Table 1.
Sham treatment using the same pressure as the
HBO group while breathing a mixture with an
adjusted percentage of oxygen
The second documented double-blind trial used a dif-
ferent strategy and was performed in 1983 by Fischer
et al.30 In that study, the same pressure was used for
both the HBO and the control groups (2.0 ATA). This
reduced concerns about patients' perception of their
allocation due to differences in pressure between the
groups and made blinding easier because only the
breathing mixture was different.
To correct for the increase in partial pressure of
oxygen to 0.42 ATA for the control group, the breath-
ing mixture for the control group was lowered in oxy-
gen content by adding nitrogen. This resulted in a
mixture of 10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen, allowing
the control group to be exposed to about the same
partial pressure of oxygen as normal (0.2 ATA).
However, an increase in the nitrogen percentage in
the breathing mixture also increases the risk for
decompression sickness. In decompression sickness,
nitrogen bubbles are formed inside the body once the
patient is decompressed, resulting in symptoms rang-
ing from joint pain and rashes to other neurological
symptoms such as paresthesia and paresis. To prevent
this, after the treatment, the period of time in which
the pressure is lowered to normal has to be pro-
longed, by stopping once (or multiple times) during
decompression; patients in the control group have to
breathe 100% oxygen during decompression to get
rid of any excess nitrogen.

making it ``even less of a consideration.''

create similar temperature and noise levels.
All clocks and pressure gauges were removed
from inside the chamber, no watches or
electronics were allowed inside the chamber.

gas mixture was confirmed by the inside
observer where the subjects could hear;
however, all 1.3 ATA exposures used air and

Inside observers breathed oxygen three times
during every exposure, regardless of the
profile, to avoid decompression sickness. To
track complications as defined by the
Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society,
monitors interviewed each subject daily,
checked tympanic membranes and
auscultated heart and lungs. Findings were
annotated on a subject daily log. In addition,
any medical or physical complaint was
annotated in the dive record by the chamber
operator; four patients had ear blocks (none
of which required removal from the
chamber) and one confinement anxiety.

more Snellen lines) was not reported. Snellen
was performed before, after and 6 weeks

In the present review, of the 11 trials applying this
strategy, 3 used stops in the decompression to prevent
decompression sickness,35,36,38 and 1 trial administered
100% oxygen during decompression.34 Other trials did
not mention the risk of decompression sickness or the
way that this risk was minimalized. The authors of the
study using 100% oxygen during decompression
acknowledged that the use of this strategy may have
negatively influenced the inertness of the placebo, pos-
sibly decreasing the differences in outcome between the
groups.34
When blinding measures are limited to the breathing
gas alone, patients of the two groups can receive treat-
ment during the same session (in case of a multicham-
ber). Separate piping systems for air and oxygen can be
installed relatively easily, as long as the systems are
(visibly) indistinguishable from one another. To ensure
that the appropriate breathing mixture is applied, oxy-
gen concentration in the mask, or arterial oxygen ten-
sion, can be measured. For this reason and for other
safety reasons (e.g. in case of an evacuation) in most
studies, the chamber operator and/or the hyperbaric
physician was unblinded. As mentioned, unblinded
staff should be instructed not to discuss the topic of
treatment gas with the patients or any other study
participants.
Sham treatment using the same pressure as the
HBO group while breathing 21% oxygen
In 1990, Oriani et al.41 introduced a third strategy:
2.0 ATA for both groups, with the control group
breathing 21% oxygen, instead of correcting the per-
centage of oxygen to keep the partial pressure of oxygen
at 0.21 ATA. As mentioned, this resulted in the control
group breathing the equivalent of 42% oxygen under
atmospheric pressure. In the present review, seven other
trials used this same strategy, with a maximal partial
pressure of oxygen of 0.53 ATA. However, it is debata-
ble whether this strategy can be considered to deliver a
true placebo. For example, Greif et al.51 showed that
patients receiving 80% oxygen during and 2 h after col-
orectal resection had 50% fewer surgical wound infec-
tions than patients receiving 30% oxygen. The amount
of oxygen that can be therapeutic is likely to depend on
the disease being treated; however, in the absence of
sufficient evidence regarding the different oxygen frac-
tions in relation to (patho)physiology, the use of 53%
oxygen for a placebo might be incorrect. Of the 42 stud-
ies in the present review, only two cited previous studies
that showed no effect of an increased oxygen partial
pressure on the condition being investigated, to justify
their choice of a sham profile.19,37 In contrast, in 2016,
Fedorko et al.27 stated that using a placebo of 21%
oxygen is ``... extreme regarding decompression stress''
and cited earlier studies reporting the negative effects
(endothelial injury, proinflammatory changes and sig-
nificant venous gas emboli) of single, shorter exposures;
these authors concluded that using this particular pro-
file does not satisfy the criteria for an inert placebo.
Of the eight trials that used 21% oxygen at the same
pressure as the actual treatment, only three discussed
the choice for this sham profile. Two groups preferred
the use of 21% oxygen over an adjusted percentage to
avoid the risk of decompression sickness,43,46 and the
other claimed that the equivalent of 50% oxygen ``... is
generally considered to be insufficient to produce any
clinical effect in this group of patients.''44
Unfortunately, the authors presented no evidence for
this claim.
Blinding perception as reported by patients
In the first double-blind trial (performed by Hart
et al.5), the lack of barotrauma raised questions about
the adequacy of blinding measures, especially regarding
the use of a lower pressure. However, sequential trials
using the same strategy reported problems with equali-
zation: even the use of ventilation tubes in the sham
group was reported.28 This would imply that blinding
was adequate.
To further investigate blinding perception by
patients, in some trials, the patients were asked about
their allocation: at the end of treatment, patients were
asked whether they thought they had received HBO
therapy, sham treatment or if they did not know. In the
present review, for each of the three strategies identi-
fied, at least one randomized controlled trial had pro-
vided information on this topic. All studies concluded
that there was no relationship between patients' percep-
tion and their actual allocation, thereby concluding
that blinding had been adequate.25,28,32,44 In addition,
in 2008, Clarke28 stated that ``... through the use of
volunteer recreational Scuba divers it was found to be
highly unlikely that differences between groups could
be detected.'' Unfortunately, no reference was provided
to support their statement.
Apart from the information emerging from the trials
in the present review, concerns were raised by others
about the blinding perception of patients when using
sham treatment. For example, in 2008, Rainolds and
Long52 used experienced scuba divers to assess whether
they could differentiate between the use of 1.2 and
2.0 ATA; their study showed that even the most experi-
enced divers (.500 dives) were unable to make this dis-
tinction. It is important to mention that this latter
study used ``... subtle pressure variations toward the
attainment of the final target pressure'' to ensure that
patients in both groups had to constantly auto-inflate
their ears during the first 10 min of compression. In the
present review, none of the trials reported use of this
latter strategy.
472 Clinical Trials 15(5)
In 2009, Jansen et al. investigated the blinding of
volunteers who had no prior experience in hyperbaric
treatment or diving. They were asked to guess if they
were pressurized to 1.2 or 2.5 ATA and how certain
they were about this. Most volunteers reported to be
quite certain they were exposed to 2.5 ATA, even
though this opinion proved to be (statistically)
invalid.53
In 2012, Weaver et al. asked divers and experienced
chamber attendants to estimate the pressure (1.2 or
1.5 ATA) and breathing gas (air or oxygen) that was
being applied. Again, the conclusion was that no dis-
tinction could be made.54 In 2015, this latter study was
cited by Miller et al.24 to justify the choice for 1.2 ATA
in their sham group.
Based on the present research and the data from
patient questionnaires in various randomized controlled
trials, it can be concluded that adequate blinding of
patients is possible, even when using a pressure lower
than that of the actual treatment.
Complications in the sham group
A possible consequence of using pressure for the sham
group to ensure adequate patient blinding is the occur-
rence of barotrauma. In our 42 studies, barotrauma
was observed with the use of each of the three strate-
gies. Even the use of minimal pressure resulted in com-
plications: for example, in 1986, Wiles et al.7 used
1.1 ATA for the sham group, with 14 patients experien-
cing complaints due to changes in pressure (10 ear dis-
comfort, 3 deafness and 1 sinus pain). As mentioned,
even the use of ventilation tubes was reported in sham
treatment using lower pressures.28 Two trials mentioned
giving a single hyperbaric exposure to each participant
prior to inclusion in the trial to prevent barotrauma
during the study.24,34 Moreover, the manner in which
barotrauma is scored and reported is often unclear:
most studies seem to rely on patients' complaints, with
only two studies mentioning that patients were expli-
citly questioned about the occurrence of the most com-
mon complications.27,31 Only three studies mentioned
the use of otoscopy to objectively assess barotrauma of
the ears.14,29,30
With regard to another common complication, myo-
pia, in 1983, Fischer et al.30 suggested that the fact that
no myopia was seen in their sham group might poten-
tially unblind an investigator. However, later research
showed that myopia appeared in the sham group with
the use of each of the three strategies. This could either
be an effect of the (slight) increase in pressure and/or
oxygen partial pressure or a placebo effect.
Unfortunately, information on the method used to
determine myopia is often missing and is most likely
based on patients' complaints only. One study made a
routine eye examination using a Snellen chart before,
immediately after and 6 weeks after treatment to
determine visual changes. No myopia (defined as a
decrease of 2 Snellen lines) was seen in either the
HBO or sham group. Interestingly, an increase in
vision was reported in some patients, with up to three
Snellen lines in one patient in the control group.29
However, since the pathophysiology of myopia in HBO
therapy remains unclear, it is uncertain how these
results can best be interpreted.
Apart from barotrauma and myopia, claustrophobia
was also reported in sham therapy. However, this can
be expected, since the environment for patients in the
sham group is similar to that for the HBO therapy
group, in which claustrophobia is a well-known compli-
cation.2 There were no reports of serious complica-
tions, such as oxygen toxicity (not expected with the
partial pressures of oxygen used for sham treatment),
decompression sickness or lung barotrauma.
Conclusion
This review examined different strategies used in the
past to create a sham (hyperbaric) treatment. This is
important because with the increased application of
evidence-based medicine, randomized controlled trials
are a frequently requested type of research. In such a
trial, the addition of a sham treatment implies a consid-
erable burden for patients not receiving actual treat-
ment, including the time involved and the risk of
complications (e.g. barotrauma of the ears). This
means that performing such a trial is associated with
ethical considerations, especially if performed with a
vulnerable patient population, such as the elderly or
the critically ill. However, especially in research where
outcomes are patient reported, the inclusion of sham
treatment can be a valuable addition to a trial.
All trials included in this review followed one of the
three sham profiles: use of a lower pressure than the
HBO group, while breathing 21% oxygen; use of the
same pressure as the HBO group, while breathing a
mixture with an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and use
of the same pressure as the HBO group, while breath-
ing 21% oxygen. The advantages and disadvantages of
these strategies concerning blinding procedures, practi-
cality, safety and inertness of placebo have been
discussed.
The use of minimal pressurization and 21% oxygen
was found to provide adequate blinding and cause the
least interference on partial pressure of gases and, there-
fore, in creating an inert placebo. Although this strategy
is associated with additional considerations regarding
practicality and blinding measures, it is the most fre-
quently used and documented profile. Considerable
care is required when deciding which sham procedure
to use; moreover, researchers need to report in detail
the measures that were taken to ensure adequate perfor-
mance of the chosen strategy.
