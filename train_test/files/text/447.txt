Context: Eating disorders are severe conditions, but
little is known about the prevalence or correlates of
these disorders from population-based surveys of ado-
lescents.
Objectives: To examine the prevalence and correlates
of eating disorders in a large, reprefentative sample of US
adolescents.
Design: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents with face-
to-face interviews using a modified version of the Com-
posite International Diagnostic Interview.
Setting: Combined household and school adolescent
samples.
Participants: Nationally representative sample of 10 123
adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.
Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence and correlates
of eating disorders and subthreshold conditions.
Results: Lifetime prevalence estimates of anorexia ner-
vosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder were
0.3%, 0.9%, and 1.6%, respectively. Important differ-
ences were observed between eating disorder subtypes
concerning sociodemographic correlates, psychiatric co-
morbidity, role impairment, and suicidality. Although the
majority of adolescents with an eating disorder sought
some form of treatment, only a minority received treat-
ment specifically for their eating or weight problems.
Analyses of 2 related subthreshold conditions suggest that
these conditions are often clinically significant.
Conclusions: Eating disorders and subthreshold eat-
ing conditions are prevalent in the general adolescent
population. Their impact is demonstrated by generally
strong associations with other psychiatric disorders, role
impairment, and suicidality. The unmet treatment needs
in the adolescent population place these disorders as im-
portant public health concerns.

ALTHOUGH THE LIFETIME
prevalence estimates of
eating disorders from
population-based studies
of adults are relatively low
(0.5%-1.0% for anorexia nervosa [AN] and
0.5%-3.0% for bulimia nervosa [BN]),1-8
their severity and dramatic impact have
been repeatedly demonstrated through el-
evated rates of role impairment,1,2,9 medi-
cal complications,10 comorbidity,1,2,11 mor-
tality,12-14 and suicide.12,13,15,16 Regarding
children and adolescents, previous popu-
lation-based studies of eating disorders
have focused on youths who meet full
DSM-IV criteria without presenting infor-
mation on youths with eating problems
that fall below current diagnostic thresh-
olds. Eating disorder not otherwise speci-
fied (EDNOS), a broad category that cov-
ers clinically significant eating disorders
that do not meet criteria for AN or BN,
tends to be more frequently diagnosed in
clinical settings than either of the DSM-IV
eating disorder subtypes.17-19 In fact, adult
population­based studies that have ex-
panded measures to include EDNOS sub-
types have found a greater prevalence of
binge-eating disorder (BED) and related
symptoms than that of AN and BN com-
bined.1,2
Community studies that used dimen-
sional measures in youths have also yielded
far greater prevalences of disordered eat-
ing behaviors (ie, 14%-22%)20,21 than those
found in studies that applied strict DSM-IV
diagnostic criteria.22,23 Taken together,
these findings indicate that the full spec-
trum of disordered eating is likely to be
considerably higher than previously esti-
mated, a possibility that may have major
public health implications depending on
their physical, mental, and social conse-
quences. Investigations of eating disor-
ders in community samples of youths are
relatively rare,22,23 and comprehensive de-

scriptions of unspecified or subthreshold eating condi-
tions have not been addressed in any prior representa-
tive adolescent samples to our knowledge.
This study examines eating disorders in the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-
ment (NCS-A), a nationally representative sample of US
adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. The objectives of this
investigation are the following: (1) to present the life-
time and 12-month prevalences of AN, BN, BED, and sub-
threshold eating disorders; (2) to examine their sociode-
mographic and clinical correlates and patterns of
comorbidity with other mental disorders; and (3) to de-
scribe the magnitude of role impairment, suicidal behav-
ior, and service use associated with these disorders.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS-A is a nationally representative face-to-face inter-
view survey of 10 123 adolescents in the continental United
States. The background, measures, design, and clinical valid-
ity of the NCS-A have been described in detail elsewhere.24-26
Briefly, the NCS-A sample was based on a nationally represen-
tative household sample (n=879 adolescents) and a school
sample (n=9244 adolescents), with a combined response rate
of 82.9%. One parent or parental surrogate of each participat-
ing adolescent was asked to complete a self-administered ques-
tionnaire that contained questions about the adolescent's men-
tal health and service use; the self-administered questionnaire
had a conditional response rate of 83.3%.
Sociodemographic variables assessed in the NCS-A in-
clude age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, parental or
parental surrogate­reported marital status, household in-
come, and urbanicity. Parental/surrogate marital status was
grouped into married or cohabiting, previously married (in-
cluding divorced, widowed, or separated), never married, and
unknown. Household income was used to calculate the pov-
erty income ratio, defined as the ratio of the income to the pov-
erty line. The 2000 census definitions were used to code ur-
banicity by distinguishing large metropolitan areas from smaller
metropolitan areas and rural areas.
ASSESSMENT OF DSM-IV DISORDERS
The DSM-IV disorders were assessed using a modification of
the fully structured World Health Organization Composite In-
ternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) administered to the ado-
lescents by lay interviewers. In addition to the adolescent in-
terviews, parent report from the self-administered questionnaire
was incorporated to assess a selection of behavioral disorders,
including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct dis-
order, and oppositional defiant disorder; attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder was defined by parent report, while the
other behavioral disorders were defined by endorsement of either
the parent or adolescent. Definitions of all psychiatric disor-
ders adhered to DSM-IV criteria except the definition of oppo-
sitional defiant disorder, which was modified to enhance clini-
cal validity based on a clinical reappraisal subsample.27 Although
service use has been included as an index of impairment in de-
riving DSM-IV diagnoses in other articles,28 this criterion was
removed from the diagnostic algorithms for the purposes of these
and other related analyses.29 Additionally, indices of disability
assessed solely for 12-month disorders were not considered in
defining lifetime disorder severity. Both lifetime and 12-
month disorders were examined, as was the age at their onset.
A more complete description of the diagnostic measures has
been presented by Merikangas et al.24
The CIDI was designed to assess diagnostic criteria based
on the DSM-IV criteria for AN, BN, and BED. In accordance
with the diagnostic algorithms developed for the parallel adult
US survey,2 both AN and BN followed the DSM-IV criteria and
BED followed the proposed DSM-5 criteria.30 Because the CIDI
did not directly assess loss of control associated with binge eat-
ing, items that tapped the cognition of loss of control were used
to approximate this DSM-IV criterion. Diagnostic hierarchies
were applied with AN taking precedence over BN, and BN su-
perseding BED. More than 1 eating disorder subtype could be
assigned only if there was clear evidence for a temporal dis-
tinction between the manifestations of the 2 subtypes.
Sufficient information was also available to define sub-
threshold AN (SAN) and subthreshold BED (SBED) among those
youths who did not meet criteria for AN, BN, or BED. The defi-
nition of SAN included the following: (1) lowest body weight
less than 90% of the adolescent's ideal body weight; (2) in-
tense fear of weight gain at the time of the lowest weight; and
(3) no history of another threshold-level eating disorder. The
definition of SBED included the following: (1) binge eating at
least twice a week for several months; (2) perceived loss of con-
trol; and (3) no history of another threshold-level eating dis-
order or SAN. Combined, BED, SAN, and SBED capture a po-
tentially large subset of the EDNOS category, but other symptom
patterns of EDNOS could not be ascertained (eg, purging dis-
order, subthreshold BN).
IMPAIRMENT
Among subjects who met criteria for an eating disorder within
the past 12 months, impairment was assessed using the Shee-
han Disability Scale.31 The Sheehan Disability Scale captures
the severity of role impairment in 4 domains: home, school or
work, family, and social life. In each of these domains, the Shee-
han Disability Scale measures impairment on a scale from 0 to
10 with anchors provided to the adolescent; non-0 scores in-
dicate any impairment due to the disorder, while scores at or
above 7 indicate severe or very severe impairment. In addition
to this scale, these respondents were also asked to report the
number of days on which they were "totally unable to go to
school or work or carry out [their] normal activities because
of problems with [their] eating or weight."
SUICIDALITY
Adolescents were asked about lifetime suicide ideation, plans,
and attempts. Because of the sensitivity of these questions, lit-
erate adolescents were not asked these questions directly in the
face-to-face interview but rather read the questions and re-
sponded to them separately. Adolescents who could not read
were instead asked these questions orally (n=232). Adoles-
cents were asked about suicide plans and attempts only if they
endorsed suicide ideation.
SERVICE USE
Boththeparent(orparentalsurrogate)andadolescentwereasked
whether the adolescent had ever been treated for emotional or
behavioral problems. Reports of service use were classified into
the following categories: (1) mental health specialty care: ser-
vices provided by a psychiatrist in settings such as a mental health
clinic, drug or alcohol clinic, emergency department, and admis-
sions to hospitals and other facilities; (2) general medical care:

tual advisor, or mental health crisis hotlines; (4) complementary
and alternative medicine: participation in support groups, in self-
help groups, or with any other healer; (5) juvenile justice: ser-
vices provided by a probation or juvenile correction officer; and
(6) school services: services rendered in the school environ-
ment, including attendance at a special school or special class for
childrenwithemotionalandbehavioralproblems,treatmentfrom
a mental health nurse, school counseling, and school-
administered medication. Adolescents who met criteria for AN,
BN, or BED were also asked whether they had ever talked with a
medical doctor or professional specifically about their eating or
weight problems. With the exception of the eating disorder­
specific question, the analysis of service use in this study is based
on endorsement by either the parent or child; levels of agree-
ment between the parent and adolescent reports on service use
across the entire sample were acceptable (=0.54). Further in-
formation on lifetime service use in the NCS-A has been re-
ported elsewhere.29
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All analyses were completed using the SUDAAN software sys-
tem version 10 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina). The data were weighted to adjust for differ-
ential probabilities of selection of respondents within school
and household samples, differential nonresponse, and re-
sidual differences between the sample and the US population
on the cross-classification of sociodemographic variables.26
The Taylor series linearization method was implemented to
adjust for the effects of weighting and clustering on all pre-
sented estimates and standard errors. Logistic regression
models were used to obtain estimates of odds ratios, adjusting
for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Statistical significance was
consistently evaluated using .05-level, 2-sided tests.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE AND
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
Lifetime prevalence rates of AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED
were 0.3%, 0.9%, 1.6%, 0.8%, and 2.5%, respectively
(Table 1). The 12-month prevalence rates of AN, BN,
BED, and SBED were 0.2%, 0.6%, 0.9%, and 1.1%, re-
spectively, with 12-month to lifetime prevalence ratios
of 57.9%, 72.0%, 56.0%, and 44.5%, respectively. Among
adolescents with BN, 41.3% reported purging in their life-
time while the rest met criteria through nonpurging com-
pensatory behaviors.
Regarding lifetime prevalence estimates, there were
no sex differences in the prevalence of AN or SBED, while
BN, BED, and SAN were more prevalent in girls
(Table 2). Significant ethnic differences emerged for BN,
with Hispanic adolescents reporting the highest preva-
lence; there was a trend toward ethnic minorities report-
ing more BED, while non-Hispanic white adolescents
tended to report more AN. Measures of socioeconomic
status, including parental education, household in-
come, and parental/surrogate marital status, were not sig-
nificantly associated with any eating disorder presenta-
tion.
AGE AT ONSET
Age-at-onset curves for AN, BN, BED, and SBED are
shown in the Figure. The median ages at onset of AN,
BN, BED, and SBED were 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, and 12.6 years,
respectively. Interquartile ranges for AN, BN, BED, and
SBED were 11.2 to 13.0, 11.1 to 13.5, 11.2 to 13.5, and
10.0 to 14.3 years, respectively.
COMORBIDITY WITH OTHER
MENTAL DISORDERS
The majority of respondents with an eating disorder met
criteria for at least 1 other lifetime DSM-IV disorder as-
sessed in this study across the lifetime, with 55.2%, 88.0%,
83.5%, 79.8%, and 70.1% of adolescents with AN, BN,
BED, SAN, and SBED, respectively, endorsing 1 or more
comorbid psychiatric disorders (Table 3). The ad-
justed odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for comor-
bid disorders by eating disorder subtype were 1.5 (0.5-
4.4) for AN, 8.6 (2.7-27.3) for BN, 5.9 (2.5-13.8) for BED,

4.3 (2.0-8.8) for SAN, and 2.7 (1.8-4.1) for SBED. An-
orexia nervosa was not associated with any other men-
tal disorder except oppositional defiant disorder. In con-
trast, BN and BED were significantly associated with nearly
every disorder assessed. Both subthreshold presenta-
tions showed modest amounts of comorbidity across
classes of DSM-IV disorders. In particular, BN and BED
were strongly associated with mood and anxiety disor-
ders and with multiple disorders, with 27.0% of adoles-
cents with BN and 37.0% of adolescents with BED en-
dorsing 3 or more classes of comorbid disorders.
IMPAIRMENT
Among adolescents with 12-month AN, BN, BED, and
SBED, 97.1%, 78.0%, 62.6%, and 34.6%, respectively, re-
ported impairment in the past 12 months; 24.2%, 10.7%,
8.7%, and 2.8%, respectively, reported severe impair-
ment (Table 4). Eating disorders were most strongly as-
sociated with social impairment. Nearly all of those with
AN (88.9%) reported social impairment, and 19.6% re-
ported severe social impairment associated with their eat-
ing disorder. Adolescents with BN and BED also re-
ported that their eating problems most impaired their
social and family relationships. Although impairment in
these domains was relatively high, youths with eating dis-
orders rarely reported that their eating problems led to
complete loss of role functioning for an entire day. Among
adolescents with 12-month AN, BN, BED, and SBED,
11.6%, 14.4%, 9.8%, and 11.9%, respectively, reported
at least 1 day in the past year when they were com-
pletely unable to carry out normal activities. The re-
ported number of days out of role ranged from 0 to 90
days for AN, 0 to 10 days for BN, 0 to 30 days for BED,
and 0 to 41 days for SBED.
SUICIDALITY
Lifetime suicidality was associated with all subtypes of
eating disorders (Table 5). Each eating disorder sub-
type was associated with significantly elevated levels of
suicide ideation, while BN and SAN were further asso-
ciated with suicide plans and BN and BED were associ-
ated with suicide attempts. Of note, adolescents with SAN
reported levels of suicide ideation comparable to those
of adolescents with AN and considerably more suicide
plans and attempts. Suicidality was particularly associ-
ated with BN, as more than half of adolescents with BN

SERVICE USE
The majority of adolescents with an eating disorder re-
ceived some sort of treatment for an emotional or be-
havioral problem. Among subjects with AN, BN, BED,
SAN, and SBED, 77.6%, 88.2%, 72.6%, 70.5%, and 64.2%,
respectively, received some form of treatment in their life-
time (Table 6). However, much smaller proportions had
sought treatment specifically for their eating or weight
problems (27.5%, 21.5%, 11.4%, and 3.4% for AN, BN,
BED, and SBED, respectively). The majority of youths who
had received services had sought treatment from a men-
tal health specialty (68.8%, 60.9%, 60.4%, 54.3%, and
48.8% for AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED, respectively).
A sizable minority of youths with AN had sought treat-
ment from human services (40.0%) and school services
(40.4%), while many of those with BN also sought treat-
ment from the general medical sector (49.2%) and school
services (45.4%). Adolescents with each of the eating dis-
order subtypes were significantly more likely to seek any
treatment and mental health specialty treatment than ado-
lescents without these disorders.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, this investigation provides the first
report on the prevalence, correlates, impact, and service
use patterns of both threshold and subthreshold eating
disorders in a nationally representative sample of US ado-
lescents. The observed prevalence estimates were gen-
erally similar to those of previous studies,1-8,22,23 and sa-
lient differences in sociodemographic and clinical
correlates were observed between eating disorder sub-
types. Subthreshold eating conditions that were fre-
quent in this population were characterized by many of
the same severity markers as cases meeting diagnostic cri-
teria. While most adolescents with eating disorders re-
ceived some form of treatment, only a minority of af-
fected individuals received services specifically for eating
or weight problems. These findings underscore the im-
portant public health implications for a wide spectrum
of disordered eating among US youths as well as the ne-
cessity to improve treatment access for these condi-
tions.
Prevalence estimates for eating disorders have been
difficult to compare across studies owing to differences
in research methods as well as cultural and societal dif-
ferences that affect base prevalence. The observed life-
time prevalence estimates of 0.3% for AN, 0.9% for BN,
and 1.6% for BED were only slightly lower than those
reported for US adults using parallel methods.2 How-
ever, the ages at onset of each of these disorders were
markedly younger in the present sample, thereby under-
scoring the likelihood that retrospective assessments of
adults may overestimate the age at onset of these condi-
tions for a variety of possible reasons.32
The sex ratio for most eating spectrum disorders in
this study was generally smaller than that in prior treat-
ment-seeking samples and considerably smaller than the
9:1 ratio stated in the DSM-IV. The lack of a female pre-
ponderance of eating disorders could be attributable to
either the methods of the present study or a true lack of
a sex difference in eating disorders in adolescence. One
indication that the difference may be genuine is pro-
vided by the large female to male ratio for SAN. Future
analyses will explore possible explanations for sex dif-
ferences in eating symptoms and disorders.
Prevalence estimates of eating spectrum disorders also
varied by race, with Hispanic adolescents having the high-
est rates of BN. The greater prevalence of BN in Hispanic
adolescents should be interpreted with caution as immi-
gration status, country of birth, and length of residence in
theUnitedStatesmayallhaveaneffectontheriskofBN.33-35
Nonetheless, this larger prevalence highlights an impor-
tant discrepancy between treatment-seeking samples and
the full US adolescent population.36

tween discrete subtypes in our study provide evidence
for the validity of these distinctions. There was perva-
sive lifetime comorbidity among youths with BN, whereas
AN was associated with only 1 other disorder (ie, oppo-
sitional defiant disorder). Likewise, suicidality was more
commonamongadolescentswithBNcomparedwiththose
with AN, corroborating findings from previous commu-
nity surveys43 and some clinical studies.12-14 By contrast,
severe role impairment was more common among ado-
lescents with AN relative to those with BN. The reasons
for variation in clinical correlates remain to be explored
but may include underlying differences in temperament
and personality characteristics,44,45 genetic, physiologi-
cal, and personal history variables,46,47 or other mecha-
nisms that may differentiate AN, BN, and BED in gen-
eral population samples.
The discrepancy between the lack of substantial co-
morbidity among adolescents in the current study48 and
the high rates of comorbidity associated with AN among
adults1,2 suggests that comorbid disorders may be a con-
sequence of AN in youths. In fact, some prospective stud-
ies49,50 provide support for comorbid disorders emerg-
ing among youths with primary eating disorders in
adolescence. Future analyses will compare the temporal
order and progression of comorbid disorders in adults
and youths in these parallel studies.
The high prevalence estimates of SAN (0.8%) and SBED
(2.5%) provide evidence for a spectrum of eating disor-
ders among youths in the general population.17-19 Sub-
threshold eating conditions were often characterized by
many of the same severity markers as threshold cases.
Most striking was the high endorsement of mental health
service use for subthreshold conditions, with more than
half of these adolescents having sought mental health spe-
cialty treatment. Patterns of comorbidity are also sug-
gestive of the clinical significance of these subthreshold
conditions in the population.20,21 Likewise, the signifi-
cant association between suicide ideation and behavior
with subthreshold conditions supports the importance
of the spectrum concept of eating disorders.
The majority (72.6%-88.2%) of adolescents with eat-
ing disorders reported some contact with the service sec-
tor for emotional or behavioral problems, with the most
frequently used sectors being mental health specialty care,
school services, general medical services, and human ser-
vices. However, only a minority (3.4%-27.5%) of indi-
viduals with eating disorders had actually talked to a pro-
fessionalspecificallyabouttheireatingorweightproblems.
This could be attributable to denial of eating problems
by adolescents, shame and/or stigma, or a lack of recog-
nition of eating symptoms by professionals treating other
targeted problems among these youths. The evidence that
adolescents do indeed use services across sectors sug-
gests possible avenues for prevention and early interven-
tion strategies if recognition could be improved (eg, edu-
cation of parents and youths to minimize stigma and of

of eating disorders). Moreover, the increased risk for cer-
tain forms of eating disorders among Hispanic and other
minority adolescents warrants particular attention in edu-
cation of youths, their families, and mental health care
professionals.33,36
Toourknowledge,thisisthefirstpopulation-basedstudy
in the United States to present the prevalence of eating dis-
ordersacrossthefulladolescentagerange.Thelargesample
size is unparalleled, and the sampling design and weight-
ing allow for generalizations to the general US adolescent
population.Inclusionofsubthresholdmanifestationsofeat-
ing disorders permitted assessment of a broader range of
eating behaviors and their clinical significance. Further
strengths are the use of face-to-face structured interviews
of the adolescents as well as inclusion of reports from both
the parent and adolescent in the assessment of service use
and behavioral disorders.
However, the cross-sectional design of this study lim-
its conclusions concerning temporal relationships among
comorbid conditions and prevents confirmation of find-
ings from adult samples concerning eating disorder cross-
overs or transitions from subthreshold to full-threshold
conditions.37-39 In addition, the small number of adoles-
cents with combinations of eating disorders (eg, only 6
adolescents met criteria for both AN and BN, and only 2
adolescents met criteria for both BN and BED) pre-
cluded our ability to investigate the correlates of com-
binations of threshold-level eating disorders.
Although 12-month prevalence is also reported, this
article primarily focuses on lifetime prevalence and cor-
relates of eating disorders. Such estimates are critical for
a comprehensive life-course understanding of these dis-
orders but may also be subject to unreliability of recall
of past symptoms or disorders due to memory, bias, de-
sirability of response, and other factors. Attempts to mini-
mize such biases were built into the methods of the
CIDI.28,51 In fact, growing evidence from prospective co-
hort studies suggests that retrospective recall yields un-
derestimates as opposed to overestimates of the true preva-
lence of psychiatric disorders.52,53 Therefore, the estimates
in this article may be a lower bound of the true preva-
lence of eating disorders.
Concerning other limitations, our diagnostic instru-
ment had not been previously validated in adolescents,
and studies using earlier versions of the CIDI found that

the instrument tended to underdiagnose eating disor-
ders in adults.54 However, the use of this same instru-
ment in 2 large adult population­based investigations per-
mitted direct comparisons across studies.1,2 An additional
concern is that the structure of the survey may not cap-
ture all clinically significant cases that fall under a not-
otherwise-specified (EDNOS) diagnosis, which corre-
sponds to a majority of the identified cases of eating
disorders. For example, the interview did not cover mani-
festations such as purging without binging, BN or BED
with weekly binge eating (a criterion currently pro-
posed for the DSM-5 for both BN and BED),30,55 or the
age at onset and impairment of SAN.
Furthermore, analyses of associations may have been
underpowered owing to the relatively small numbers of
adolescents with eating disorders. In particular, as the
unweighted number of adolescents with AN in this sample
is only 34, the lack of findings for sociodemographic mea-
sures and comorbidity may be due to this methodologic
issue rather than representing true null findings. Fur-

ther, while the prevalence of subthreshold presenta-
tions was assessed, the CIDI was originally designed to
assess only DSM-IV presentations; therefore, vital ques-
tions regarding the age at onset and impairment of SAN
in particular were not asked. This is unfortunate in light
of the research questions faced in the revision of the DSM,
and the designers of future epidemiologic studies should
consider the qualitative costs to research of enforcing skip
logic along with the monetary costs.
Despite these limitations, this study provides key in-
formation concerning the epidemiology of eating disor-
ders in the US adolescent population. The prevalence of
these disorders is higher than previously expected in this
age range, and the patterns of comorbidity, role impair-
ment, and suicidality indicate that eating disorders rep-
resent a major public health concern. Finally, these find-
ings support the nosological distinction between the major
subtypes of eating disorders as well as the importance of
inclusion of the full spectrum of eating behaviors in es-
timating the magnitude and correlates of eating disor-
ders in the US population.
