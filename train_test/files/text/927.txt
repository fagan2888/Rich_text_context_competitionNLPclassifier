Removing Barriers To Care
Among Persons With
Psychiatric Symptoms
A well-functioning managed care approach can provide an acceptable
level of care and cost.
by David Mechanic
ABSTRACT: Many persons with serious psychiatric conditions who could benefit from
available treatments do not receive care, and the barriers are generally understood to be
limited knowledge, inadequacies in insurance coverage, and stigma. Sophisticated ap-
proaches are needed to realistically eliminate these and other barriers. Public policy should
focus on criteria for need for care and encourage interventions that facilitate treatment
when it can be helpful. Appropriate insurance coverage is indispensable, and achieving
mental health parity will require careful management of care. Policymakers must help to
create a trustworthy management structure that is inclusive, that develops and dissemi-
nates models of best practice, that encourages evidence-based decision processes, and
that ensures continuing dialogue and procedural fairness in managed care decision making.
The gap between the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the U.S.
population and the provision of appropriate care is increasingly viewed as a
major public health issue.1 Much effort is now being given to understanding
and eliminating barriers to care, to informing the public about available treat-
ments, and to motivating primary care physicians to recognize and treat these con-
ditions.2 Many now recognize that lack of insurance coverage, stigma, and inade-
quate public information contribute to this gap between prevalence and care, but
a more complete understanding is needed for the sophisticated design of success-
ful programs. This paper presents a model that takes account of each stage of the
help-seeking process and suggests targeted points of intervention relevant to
meeting needs in an evidence-based and efficient way.
Recognizing symptoms and seeking care are part of an iterative sequence in
which persons become aware of changes in how they feel, assess the effects and
magnitude of these changes, attribute meaning to them, decide whether they have
a problem, assess the nature of the problem, calculate whether the problem would
benefit from intervention, decide to pursue intervention, assess whether formal

health care is required, and select the appropriate source of care.3 At various
points in the sequence, persons may reassess various issues such as the magnitude
of symptoms, the appropriate meaning of these symptoms, and the most useful
sources of assistance as they acquire more information and experience about the
course of their symptoms. Most surveys cannot capture the richness of the experi-
ence of interpreting meanings and making attributions, nor can they disentangle
the web of interconnections involved in such decision making. Studies that have
addressed the sequential nature of the help-seeking process generally find that in-
fluences vary at different points in the illness interpretation and help-seeking
process.4
Recent Surveys Of Reported Symptoms And Care
I briefly review three nationally representative studies to provide some insight
into barriers to care among persons who report symptoms and limitations that
might signify a need. The most recent is a telephone survey conducted in 2001 for
the National Mental Health Association (NMHA) of 3,239 adults age eighteen and
older. Respondents to this survey (known as NMHAS) were screened using a va-
riety of questions on depression and anxiety; 1,319 respondents were interviewed
in greater depth, including 999 with symptoms of clinical depression or general-
ized anxiety disorder or both and 320 who were judged to be asymptomatic.5 I
also use reports from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a face-to-face sur-
vey of 8,098 respondents interviewed between 1990 and 1992.6 This survey as-
sessed the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third
Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) disorders among persons ages fifteen to fifty-four.
Further, I report findings from the Healthcare for Communities (HCC) study, a
telephone survey of 9,585 adults from sixty U.S. communities obtained in 1997­98;
the survey component I examine here was conducted for the purpose of tracking
alcohol, drug, and mental health services use.7
Each of these surveys is cross-sectional, so they all are limited in representing
the sequential help-seeking process. All three agree, however, that large propor-
tions of the population who have symptoms indicative of a possible mental illness
receive no care for this problem. Ronald Kessler and his colleagues, for example,
found that only 46 percent of respondents who met their criteria for a twelve-
month serious mental illness (a DSM disorder associated with measured impair-
ment) received professional treatment for their emotional problem in the prior
twelve months.8 Donna McAlpine and I have reported that in the HCC almost
three-fifths of persons with a severe mental illness did not receive any specialty
mental health care.9 Similarly, the NMHAS reported that while almost a third of
the adults surveyed had symptoms indicative of clinical depression or generalized
anxiety disorder, only 18 percent of these respondents received a doctor's diagno-
sis for those symptoms. In each of these surveys, the proportions of persons receiv-
ing treatment can be greatly enlarged by adding additional comorbidities to the

primary diagnostic categories or by supplementing these with various indicators
of impairment. For example, Ramin Mojtabai and colleagues, using the NCS, re-
ported that while only 13 percent of persons with only a mood disorder sought
mental health specialty care in the prior twelve months, 25 percent who had a
combination of mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders sought such care.10
How People Explain Not Seeking Help
The structured population surveys that measure disorders limit respondents'
leeway to explain themselves. Thus, we must reconstruct respondents' motiva-
tions from how they responded to the reasons for not seeking care provided by the
survey instruments used.
In the NCS only 32 percent of the 1,792 respondents who had a twelve-month
disorder sought professional help of any kind or perceived a need for such help.
Similarly, only 18 percent of respondents in the NMHAS who had symptoms char-
acteristic of major depression or generalized anxiety disorder had received a diag-
nosis from a doctor. Less than one-tenth of the undiagnosed group believed that
their symptoms meant that they had a mental disorder, and more than half of those
with a doctor's diagnosis also did not agree. The stigma associated with the term
mentaldisorder is an important barrier; even patients commonly treated in inpatient
units reject this characterization of their problem.11 Persons with a serious mental
illness who deny that their problem is a "mental illness" report more positive so-
cial relations and a higher quality of life. Much of the negative effect of defining
one's problems as a mental illness is explained by perceived stigma, lower self-
esteem, and depressive symptomatology.12 Beyond diagnosis and impairment,
other factors associated with perceiving a need for professional care in
multivariate analyses include a positive attitude toward seeking mental health
care, marital disruption, being female, having comorbid physical conditions, hav-
ing a history of maternal psychopathology, and having insurance coverage.13
In the NMHAS, undiagnosed respondents who reported that they would not
seek a doctor's assistance for symptoms such as those covered by the survey were
asked to respond to various possible reasons.14 The largest group, 44 percent, re-
sponded "not serious, I can handle it." The second largest group, 28 percent, re-
ported having limited or no insurance, and another 18 percent reported being "too
busy to see a mental health professional." While the items did not adequately cap-
ture issues related to stigma, the item "don't want a record of having sought care"
was only cited by 5 percent of this group. About one-tenth of respondents re-
ported fear of having to take medications or not knowing of a doctor to go to.
In the NCS Kessler and colleagues also report that of those with twelve-month
serious mental illness, 55 percent did not believe that they had a problem that re-
quired treatment.15 The majority of those who did not seek treatment also re-
ported that they wanted to solve the problem on their own (72 percent) or
thought that the problem would get better by itself (61 percent). Although the re-

searchers downplay the importance of insurance, 44 percent of respondents re-
ported that they didn't seek care because care was too expensive, and 36 percent
indicated that their insurance would not cover treatment. Other frequent re-
sponses included being unsure about where to go for help (41 percent), feeling
that seeking help takes too much time or is inconvenient (28 percent), and various
responses indicating perceived lack of treatment effectiveness (45 percent).
These lists of reasons provide some useful information but fail to accurately
convey the complexity of people's thought processes as they try to make sense of
their symptoms, decide what to do about them, and then rationalize their deci-
sions. Consider a person who has a serious disorder that somewhat limits activi-
ties and who perceives that treatment might be helpful. However, lacking insur-
ance coverage and having competing wants and needs for use of available
resources, such persons might decide that they want to solve the problem on their
own and that the problem is likely to go away by itself eventually anyway. Thus,
they might be willing to delay care and observe the course of their distress.
The decision process itself is likely to be sequential, during which persons mon-
itor their symptoms, determine the extent to which they get better or worse, and,
depending on the seriousness and course of the symptoms, may periodically re-
evaluate their decision. Encouragement or coercion from friends and family or
from a primary care physician also may influence the decision process.16 Also, per-
sons who know other users of mental health services or who are part of larger net-
works of "friends and supporters" of mental health services use are more likely to
enter pathways of care.17 At any point, reevaluations of the need for treatment may
be weighed against other economic and family needs, and insurance may play a
larger role than is apparent. Economic studies conducted prior to the widespread
use of managed behavioral health care found that the use of psychiatric services
was more responsive to insurance coverage than was the case with other medical
services.18 It seems plausible that managed care has modified this pattern by ag-
gressive utilization management of mental health care use, but direct evidence on
this issue is not available.
Correlates Of Care-Seeking Stages
Numerous studies have observed that different factors affect various stages of
the help-seeking process. As Mojtabai and colleagues found, the magnitude and
severity of symptoms and limitations are the most important predictors of recog-
nition of a need for professional help.19 However, only 59 percent of those who per-
ceived such a need sought help, and none of the psychiatric variables of impor-
tance in the recognition process was statistically significant at this next stage.
Instead, having a positive attitude toward seeking mental health care, being in the
45­54 age group, and reporting a physical condition were associated with acting
on one's perceived need. The insurance measure available in this study was poor,
but there was a tendency for those with insurance coverage other than Medicaid

to be more likely to seek care.
Among those who sought care, 44 percent consulted a mental health clinician.
Selection of a mental health clinician rather than another provider was associated
with greater psychiatric morbidity. Positive attitudes toward professional help
and insurance coverage also increased the likelihood of selecting mental health
specialty care. These findings are consistent with earlier studies of community
and student populations that found that some social characteristics function
more in deciding whether to seek help, while others are more important in deter-
mining pathways into specific types of care.20 Over time people tend toward
sources of assistance that are socially and culturally compatible.
Overall, the magnitude and severity of distress and disability are the most im-
portant determinants of perceiving a need for care. Help seekers with greater dis-
tress are more likely to use mental health specialty care than are those with less
distress. Social selection, however, occurs across the range of distress and impair-
ment, and factors independent of psychopathology and disability help to explain
who enters treatment and the varying trajectories of care. Understanding such
factors could be useful in designing strategies to achieve a better fit between need
and treatment.
Treatment Of Mental Illness Is Not Unique
The processes that define how persons with symptoms identify need and de-
cide to seek care are common to most types of illness. However, the values mea-
sured on predictors such as perceived stigma, insurance coverage, expectations of
treatment benefits, and the like may vary a great deal from one illness to another.21
In a classic article on the ecology of medical care, Kerr White and his colleagues
used existing data to characterize the selective trajectories that brought individu-
als from a population at risk to various levels of care.22 A recent update of these
data indicates that approximately 80 percent of the population report an illness in
any given month, but only about a third of the population consider seeking medi-
cal care.23 Slightly more than one in five will actually visit a physician's office. Ap-
proximately one in fifteen will visit an alternative-medicine provider. As with
psychiatric symptoms, the extent of morbidity is the single best predictor of who
reaches treatment, but the care trajectory depends on many factors other than
symptoms.
A variety of models have been developed to explain these help-seeking trajecto-
ries.24 Use of less conventional treatments and providers fits a social movements
model. Early users of such services are quite distinct in their social and cultural
characteristics, but as the provider or treatment gains wider cultural acceptance,

those using the service approximate more closely the modal characteristics of the
general population.25 Bringing more people with psychiatric need into care de-
pends in part on the cultural acceptability of psychiatric treatments.
Closing The Gap Between Psychiatric Need And Care
Mental health proponents, believing that effective treatments are available for
many psychiatric conditions, are strongly motivated to close the gap between the
prevalence of conditions and the provision of treatment. They are joined by phar-
maceutical manufacturers and practitioners whose economic and professional in-
terests are tied to public acceptance of various medications and forms of therapy.
As newer medications have become available, a close alliance has developed
among mental health advocates, mental health professionals, and pharmaceutical
companies, all seeking to gain cultural acceptability and market share for their
therapies. This coalition is increasingly at loggerheads with public and private
purchasers and with managed behavioral health care companies, which are con-
cerned about the potential growth in demand and costs. The challenge is to clearly
identify who among the population with psychiatric symptoms could gain from
treatment and how best to remove the barriers to their treatment.
n Prevalence of psychiatric conditions. In the past couple of decades psychi-
atric epidemiology has greatly advanced its influence by measuring conditions rep-
resentative of disorders covered by the DSM.26 These studies generally find that
about a third of the U.S. population has had a psychiatric or substance abuse disor-
der in the prior twelve months, and more than half are believed to have had a disor-
der that meets DSM criteria at some point in their lives. Similar estimates are in-
creasingly made for children. There is much reason to believe that the criteria for
disorders based on DSM descriptions reached by professional consensus are
overinclusive; that is, they include persons who do not need, would not benefit from,
and may even be harmed by treatment.27 More recent studies have added disability
and impairment criteria to narrow the definition of needed treatment.28 This im-
proves the estimates' usefulness, but they continue to be unconvincing to critics.
n Overselling the need for treatment. There are disadvantages in overselling
the need for treatment. Inflated estimates are met with considerable public skepti-
cism and have limited credibility, thereby undermining support for extensions of in-
surance. Others derive the impression that providing needed mental health care is a
bottomless pit and not a high priority among competing needs and demands. There
is also concern that a treatment focus on symptoms that will resolve themselves and
that are often reactive to disturbing life circumstances could undermine more con-
structive coping efforts and capacities. Some mental health advocacy groups have
sought treatment and mental health parity legislation only for persons who meet
criteria for specified conditions, often referred to as "disorders of the brain." While
the intent of such specification has public policy merit, such artificial distinctions
have no scientific validity and exclude many who would benefit from treatment.

Many persons are troubled by the notion that much of the population suffers
from a mental illness, and very few would willingly accept themselves as a mem-
ber of this category. In fact, such assertions about the population are meaningless.
Most people will have a medical condition during any given year, but making such
a public pronouncement would have no purpose. Beyond whatever rhetorical
value it might have to alert or alarm the public about the prevalence of "mental ill-
ness," such estimates have little policy import. A large variety of conditions are
listed in the DSM. We would do much better discussing schizophrenia, major de-
pression, and anxiety disorders in their appropriate context rather than talking
broadly about mental health and mental illness. The term mental illness itself is a
major barrier to treatment. Moving away from this concept is difficult to achieve
but a worthy aspiration.
n Inadequate treatment for serious disorders. Studies that focus on those in
the population with the most severe and persistent illnesses find that the care re-
ceived is inadequate by any reasonable criterion.29 Many factors may contribute,
such as the lack of insight and resistance to treatment among many patients, lack or
inadequacy of insurance coverage, lack of access to appropriate services and profes-
sionals, and the seemingly intractable character of some of these disorders that may
discourage professional interest. Although certain services can be helpful for even
the most intractable disorders, providing such services requires more effort and co-
ordination than is often available. There is also competition and value disagreement
among mental health advocates about the desirability of focusing services on a
smaller but more severely ill population compared with efforts to prevent or treat
less severe pathology earlier. These divisions are exacerbated by uncertainties asso-
ciated with the costs and benefits of different treatment priorities.
A solution to this challenge is to have a broad definition for eligibility and cov-
erage but then allow experienced professionals to make the determination of
what care is needed. This essentially is what managed behavioral health care was
intended to do, and such an approach is required if we are to have any reasonable
implementation of parity in health insurance between general medical and mental
health care. Managed behavioral health care, however, lacks trust among advo-
cates for the mentally ill as well as the general public. Problems of trust are com-
pounded by disagreements among professionals about appropriate criteria for
treatment, by the profit orientation of much of the managed care industry, and by
very vigorous management of mental health services compared with management
of other medical services.30 Thus, managed behavioral health care now functions un-
der sustained derogation, litigation, and efforts at micromanagement. This is hardly a
helpful atmosphere in which to make difficult policy and treatment decisions.

Insurance For Treatment Of Psychiatric Disorders
Insurance coverage is probably the most significant factor affecting whether
persons with need receive appropriate care. Open-ended insurance for the range
of available treatments, and the ability of providers to induce demand for some of
these services, exceeds anything purchasers are willing to pay for. Thus, restoring
trust in managed behavioral health care strategies, developing systems to base
treatment availability on the best available evidence and practice, and providing
mechanisms for procedural justice in rationing care are necessary requirements.
Norman Daniels and James Sabin suggest a starting framework for procedural jus-
tice that includes making rationales for limiting access available to the public, pro-
viding "reasonable" reasons for such limitations, allowing patients and doctors to
challenge decisions and argue for their revision through established mechanisms,
and having a process to ensure fidelity to these procedures.31 The evidence is per-
suasive that a well-functioning managed care approach can provide an acceptable
level of care at a cost that purchasers could support, and managed care is the only
road to a realistic application of parity.32
The Need For Sophisticated Public Education
Despite much effort, the public is still only vaguely aware of most types of psy-
chiatric morbidity and the availability of effective treatments. Most of the effort
has gone into increasing awareness of clinical depression and its treatment, and
the greatest progress seems to have been made in this area. But even here, two-
fifths of persons in the NMHAS who were symptomatic but undiagnosed re-
ported that they had never heard of this condition. In a condition less well known
to the public, generalized anxiety disorder, 84 percent who were symptomatic but
undiagnosed reported that they had never heard of this condition.
We do not have comparable data for other specific diagnostic entities, but we
can reasonably assume that the public is unaware of most. The public is also un-
aware of most medical diagnoses, and it would be pointless to attempt to achieve
broad, highly specific knowledge. However, a small number of conditions account
for most population morbidity, and increasing public understanding of these con-
ditions and their evidence-based treatment potential would be of value. Mental
health professionals have been correct in focusing on depression because of its
profound disabling consequences and the availability of helpful treatment.33 Ex-
panding efforts to provide a more sophisticated understanding of the half-dozen
or so conditions that cause much impairment and for which useful treatments are
available could serve as a good basis for future educational efforts.
Behavioral research makes clear that knowledge by itself is not a sufficient in-
ducement to bring people into needed care. Distress and impairment and aware-
ness of treatment potential provide motivation, but a range of other enabling fac-
tors make it more probable that perceived need will translate into treatment.
These include the implementation of an action plan with such steps as specifically

knowing how to call for help or where to go and overcoming barriers of payment,
transportation, embarrassments, and other disincentives to action. Involvement in
social circles supportive of treatment helps some to overcome barriers of what to
do and how to do it and makes taking some action more acceptable. Public infor-
mation campaigns have to more clearly include and explain action plans.34
Additional Implications For Public Policy
The challenge for public policy is to develop a structure that makes it possible
to close the gap in unmet need at a cost that purchasers and the larger society will
find acceptable. Advocates have argued for decades for more resources to be de-
voted to mental health treatment, but they face many competitors. The good news
is that we have increasingly convincing evidence that need can be met at an ac-
ceptable cost by sophisticated management of care. The bad news is that the in-
struments for achieving this--managed behavioral health care strategies--are
persistently bad-mouthed by professionals who see their incomes and autonomy
threatened and by many advocates who dislike any constraints on the provision of
care. Any reasonable pattern of mental health services that is sufficiently compre-
hensive and that does not exclude large numbers of people will have to be a system
that is carefully managed.
Policymakers have to stay focused on the key issues: extension of insurance cov-
erage for psychiatric morbidity; continued development and dissemination of
models of best practice; encouragement of an evidence-based decision process;
and procedures to ensure continued dialogue and procedural fairness in managed
care decision making. They also must recognize the uncertainties and inadequa-
cies of care and promote continued knowledge development and understanding.
Assessments of need are best made by experienced professionals. From a policy
perspective, this is achieved by easing the initial access to care and evaluation, so
that a balanced judgment can be made of the extent of need and the benefits from
timely and focused treatment. In principle, this is what good managed behavioral
health care is intended to achieve, but the public remains suspicious of its motives
and decision-making criteria.
The challenge is to increase acceptance of a managed approach
that is essential to putting into place a realistic concept of mental health
parity. It is evident that a tighter regulatory structure will be required to
achieve public legitimacy. Such a structure would include an appropriate and fair
complaint and grievance process, the use of patient representatives to adjudicate
disputes informally and early in the treatment process, and clear and visible guide-
lines for rationing decisions that can be contested by patients or their advocates.
This is not an ideal world, but probably all of this is possible within present reali-
ties. Government can help by prudently designing a regulatory framework that
achieves these objectives and contributes to building public trust.
