Introduction
The personal, social, and economic cost of alcohol consump-
tion in Scotland has been estimated to be approximately £7.5
billion per year (Johnson, Ludbrook, & Jaffray, 2012), and
while rates of associated health problems and mortality over-
all have been reducing in the past 10 years, they continue to
surpass those of the rest of the United Kingdom (Beeston
et al., 2013). In 2014, 18% more alcohol was sold per adult
in Scotland compared with England and Wales (Robinson,
Beeston, McCartney, & Craig, 2015).
Scottish governmental responses have included a range of
legislative measures through the "Changing Scotland's
Relationship with Alcohol: A Framework for Action" (Scottish
Government, 2009), which adopts a whole-population
approach. In an attempt to mitigate the effects of low cost and
easily accessible alcohol, acknowledged by the Health First
evidence-based alcohol strategy (University of Stirling,
Alcohol Health Alliance, British Liver Trust, 2013) to be two
key drivers facilitating excessive alcohol consumption, the
Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Act 2010 was implemented in October
2011 (Scottish Parliament, 2010). This legislation banned
quantity discounts plus other alcohol promotions in off-sales
premises (outlets licensed to sell alcohol for consumption off
the premises). A subsequent reduction in off-trade wine sales
was reported, but with little evidence of impact on sales of
other drink types (Robinson et al., 2013). However, Nakamura
et al. (2013) found that banning alcohol multi-buy promotions
(primarily for beer, cider, and wine) in Scotland did not reduce
alcohol purchasing in the short term, and suggested that wider
regulation of price promotion and price would be required.
The Alcohol (Minimum Pricing; Scotland) Act 2012
(Scottish Parliament, 2012) will set a minimum price at
which a unit of alcohol may be sold (1 U.K. unit equals
8gm/10ml ethanol), currently favored at 50 pence (£0.5:
U.S.$0.8) per U.K. unit (50ppu). However, the legality of
this Act in terms of international trade agreements was chal-
lenged by the trade bodies representing alcohol producers,

Heavy Drinkers' Perspectives on
Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in
Scotland: A Qualitative Interview Study
Fiona O'May1, Jan Gill2, Heather Black2, Cheryl Rees3,
Jonathan Chick2, and Barbara McPake4
Abstract
The irrefutable consequence of Scottish excessive alcohol consumption has prompted implementation and proposal of
alcohol policy measures. The purpose of this study is to explore with heavy drinkers their awareness of and identify potential
implications of policy introducing alcohol minimum unit pricing (MUP). Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were
conducted with drinkers with alcohol-related harm (n = 20; 15 males, five females; aged 34 to 67 years old) in Scotland's two
largest cities (drinkers were participants within a larger quantitative study, through attendance for treatment for alcohol-
related harms at National Health Service [NHS] centers). Median weekly consumption among participants was 130.7 units
(range: 28-256.3 U.K. units). Views regarding the impact of increased alcohol prices, through MUP, were mixed. While some
drinkers indicated potential reduction in intake, thus possibly reducing alcohol harms in the long term, the expected, or even
desired, from a public health perspective, effects on consumption and associated harms might not be fully realized in this
group. To mitigate possible unintended short-term detrimental effects of MUP on the most vulnerable, careful planning and
appropriate resourcing may be required prior to implementation.

and it was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The ECJ ruled that the Act was in breach of European Union
(EU) free-trade laws, but returned the case to Scotland civil
courts for a final ruling. At the time of writing, this process is
ongoing, and the outcome, and therefore any implementation
date for the Act, remain uncertain. An account of the Act's
development and the policy context can be found in
Katikireddi, Hilton, Bonell, and Bond (2014) and Katikireddi,
Bond, and Hilton (2014).
Evidence in support of increasing the price of alcohol to
reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality derived from
systematic reviews emerging from the United Kingdom,
Australia, the United States, and Europe is persuasive (e.g.,
Booth et al., 2008; Elder et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2010;
Wagenaar, Tobler, & Komro, 2010). Scottish Minimum Unit
Pricing (MUP) legislation was also critically informed by a
model proposed by Sheffield University (Meng, Purshouse,
Brennan, & Meier, 2010; Purshouse, Meng, Rafia, Brennan,
& Meier, 2009). The Sheffield alcohol policy model version
2 was adapted to a Scottish context by incorporating
Scotland-specific data on levels of alcohol consumption, the
prices paid by population sub-groups for different categories
of alcohol, and the preferences for off-licensed trade versus
on-licensed trade purchasing (Purshouse et al., 2009).
Updated versions of the model (Meng, Hill-McManus,
Brennan, & Meier, 2010, 2012) adjusting for the imposition
of a 50ppu minimum price combined with a discount ban,
predict figures for extra spending per annum for moderate,
hazardous, and harmful drinkers at £11, £65, and £148,
respectively, which equates to an additional spend per week
of £0.22, £1.25, and £2.83. The model defines moderate
drinkers as men/women who consume no more than 21/14
U.K. units per week, hazardous drinkers as consuming
between 21/14 and 50/35 units per week, and harmful drink-
ers as consuming more than 50/35 units per week,
respectively.
In British Columbia, Canada, where alcohol minimum
pricing (not minimum unit price) has been introduced, sig-
nificant health benefits have been observed, including a 32%
reduction in wholly alcohol attributable deaths following a
10% increase in average minimum price for all alcoholic
drinks (Zhao et al., 2013). An important assertion is that,
despite popular opinion, even the heaviest drinkers reduced
their consumption when minimum alcohol prices increased
(Zhao et al., 2013).
The Scottish Government believes that MUP is the most
effective of a range of policy options to tackle price, and help
reduce alcohol consumption and related harm (Scottish
Government, n.d.). MUP would set a floor price for one unit
of alcohol, below which it could not be sold. For example,
one 440 ml can of 5% cider contains 2.2 units, therefore, the
minimum price for which it could be legally sold would be
£1.10, so there would be no financial benefit in buying in
bulk (as is currently the case). Certainly, current Scottish
sales data (Robinson et al., 2015) would predict the greatest
impact on the price of spirits (particularly vodka) and strong
white cider. Those defined as moderate drinkers would be
marginally affected as they consume a small amount of alco-
hol. Alcohol purchasing in licensed premises (e.g., pubs, res-
taurants) is likely to be unaffected by MUP as prices already
greatly exceed the minimum proposed.
The developers of the Sheffield model acknowledge that
as it is based on general population data, it cannot predict the
impact on heavy drinkers. Byrnes, Shakeshaft, Petrie, and
Doran (2013), using Australian survey data, reported that
when faced with price increases, "high intensity" drinkers
continued to binge by reducing their alcohol consumption
between episodes of binging. The reduced drinking in itself
may afford some health benefits, but the episodic binging
represents a harmful drinking pattern. As the price of indi-
vidual, cheap drinks will increase, a likely effect of MUP
may be surmised from the findings of the following studies.
Recent work from New Zealand (Casswell, Huckle, Wall, &
Yeh, 2014) revealed that heavy drinkers paid more for alco-
hol overall than the general population because they con-
sumed more, but they paid less for individual drinks as they
bought disproportionate quantities of cheap, typically strong,
alcohol. They tended to buy their alcohol from off-trade
sources. Similar conclusions were reached in two separate
studies involving drinkers harmed by their alcohol consump-
tion in Scotland (Black, Gill, & Chick, 2011; Black et al.,
2014), where participants tended to purchase cheap alcohol,
with around 95% of purchases being from off-sale outlets
(i.e., supermarkets and corner shops, etc.).
A common criticism of increasing the price of alcohol is
that, if people with alcohol dependence can no longer afford
their drink of choice, they will need to find a substitute,
whether that be cheaper alcohol, counterfeit or illicit alcohol,
or other substances. Alternatively, they might resort to theft.
On balance, the evidence suggests that increases in alcohol
pricing tend to be associated with reductions in crime (Home
Office, 2011), but there is currently insufficient evidence to
determine the impact of alcohol prices and purchase of other
licit and illicit substances (Hunt, Rabinovich, & Baumberg,
2010).
Thus, it appears that further data relating to the drinking
patterns of the heaviest drinkers in society would be valuable
and informative. These drinkers rarely take part in routine
population surveys documenting consumption (Livingston
& Callinan, 2015), and factors, other than price, that restrict
or facilitate their consumption are poorly described. As sug-
gested by Chalmers (2014), the Sheffield alcohol policy
model would ideally be built on a dataset including people's
alcohol purchases, consumption, location of purchase, and
price.
Our participants comprised both dependent drinkers, and
those whose health was at least harmed in some way by their
drinking, as they were all recruited in hospital or clinic set-
tings for treatment relating to their alcohol consumption. To
our knowledge, this is the first report exploring the current,
O'May et al. 3
and self-predictions of future, purchasing behavior of a
group of heavy (as we refer to them throughout the article)
drinkers explicitly in relation to proposed alcohol policy.
Aims and Objectives
In light of the recent policy measures proposed by the
Scottish Government, this study interviewed heavy drinkers
to elicit their views regarding the cost of alcohol in Scotland,
explore their awareness of increases in alcohol price, and
opinions regarding implications of MUP should it be imple-
mented, at a personal and wider level.
Method
The findings reported here are in accordance with the
Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research
(COREQ) 32-item checklist (Tong, Sainsbury, & Craig, 2007).
This study sits within a 2-year prospective study of 639 patients
attending alcohol treatment services as outpatients or admitted
as hospital inpatients with an alcohol-related problem (which
has resulted in physiological and/or psychosocial harm), who
were interviewed about their drinking and purchasing habits
approximately every 6 months over a period of 24 to 30 months.
Participants were asked at their third quantitative inter-
view (T3), (between October 2013 and March 2014, around
18 months after recruitment), whether they would be willing
to take part in an additional semi-structured face-to-face
interview (see the appendix) to explore their experiences and
views about recent alcohol policy and the governmental pro-
posal to legislate a "minimum unit price" for alcohol. The
interview was scheduled for a date as soon after the T3 inter-
view as mutually convenient, mostly between 1 and 4 weeks.
From those who indicated willingness, 20 participants were
recruited, 10 from each of the two Scottish cities in the study
(Glasgow and Edinburgh). Participants were purposively
selected on the basis that they had been drinking at hazard-
ous or harmful levels at T3, and that the average price they
were paying at that time was less than 50ppu. Care was taken
to ensure that they were approximately representative of the
total sample by gender, social deprivation quintile, and age
(see Table 1). Participants were contacted by telephone, and
interview dates and times arranged. If participants failed to
keep their appointment, they were contacted to confirm
whether or not they were still willing to take part, if not, the
interviewer then selected another potential participant from
those meeting the inclusion criteria, until the target quota of
10 participants from each city was achieved.
Of the 28 participants contacted, three failed to respond,
two declined to participate, and three did not attend the
arranged interview. Of the 20 interviewed, five were not
drinking at the time of the qualitative interview, but reported

harmful drinking at some stage in the 6 month period prior
to, or at, T3; mean age was 48.3 years, five were female.
Reported median weekly consumption (past 7 days, or typi-
cal drinking week) was 130.7 units at T3 (range 28-256.26
units), and all social quintiles were represented, broadly mir-
roring the distribution in the larger study.
Prior to the interview, participants received by mail details
of the interview topics, assurance of anonymity and confi-
dentiality, and their right to discontinue the interview at any
point, with no detrimental consequences. It was emphasized
that the questions were designed to obtain their views and
opinions, and that there were no right or wrong answers.
Interviews took place in a health service site. Consent for
being interviewed and for audio recording was taken at inter-
view. During each interview, the interviewer gave a brief
explanation of the Alcohol Minimum Pricing Act, followed
by an example, using white cider, and their preferred drink
(if that was different), to demonstrate how the existing price
would be affected by an MUP of 50ppu.
Interviews were arranged and conducted by the research-
ers who had administered the earlier quantitative interviews
(H.B., C.R.), to capitalize on the degree of trust already
established. Interviews were recorded using an encrypted
digital recorder, and were between 20 and 50 min in length.
An additional member of the research team (F.O'M.) was
also in attendance (once the participant had given permis-
sion) to observe the interview and make notes, subsequently
transcribe the recordings, and analyze the data. Interviews
were conducted between October 2013 and March 2014,
between 1 and 6 weeks after T3 interview. Handwritten field-
work notes were kept during the data collection and analysis
process. Upon completion of the interview, participants were
given a £10 voucher for a high street pharmacy-led health
and beauty store, and reimbursed for any travel expenses.
Data Analysis
The interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first
author, and during this process, initial thoughts and ideas
were noted down, as an essential part of the analytic pro-
cess (Riessman, 1993). Thematic analysis was conducted,
as described by Braun and Clarke (2006). All the tran-
scripts were read multiple times, to identify categories of
relevance to the research aims; emerging themes and com-
monalities were noted. These categories were then grouped
according to consistency in topic, as well as in relation to
the research aims, and themes were thereby constructed,
representing recurring topics. Verification of coding was
confirmed by a second research team member, and all
authors had iterative discussions regarding the construc-
tion of themes and their interpretation. The constant com-
parative method was used to help identify reasons for
patterns and contradictions in the data.
Ethical approval was provided by National Health Service
(NHS) Lothian Research Ethics Committee and was
reviewed by the respective Caldicott Guardians.
Results
When asked about proposed alcohol policy, specifically
MUP, participants gave wide ranging responses, sometimes
relating it to their own personal experiences, and at other
times projecting, referring to other drinkers, known or
unknown to them, or the general public.
Contextually, public houses and bars played a minimal role
in participants' lives, with only one or two reporting drinking
in pubs, and then only occasionally, or when friends took them
out. Pubs were generally considered to be far too expensive for
alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks alike, the latter reducing
any incentive to supplement or replace alcoholic beverages,
and actually encouraging individuals to drink at home. Other
comments indicated that pubs were where social drinking took
place, which was no longer possible for these individuals; that
they were not safe places because people could become vio-
lent and aggressive; and that drinking soft drinks in a pub
made you feel silly as pubs were for drinking alcohol.
Drinkers' Anticipated Personal Strategies to Cope
With an Increase in Drink Prices Through MUP
Implementation
When asked what would happen if the price of their preferred
drinks were to increase, various tactical ways to manage were
proffered. One participant reported she would switch from
lager to spirits, as they were higher strength and she would get
more units for her money, and could make her drink last longer
by adding mixers. Alternatively switching to cheaper alcohol,
such as white cider or supermarket own brand, was mentioned,
". . . it's only when I'm down to my last pennies, and what can
I buy for this, and my option is, I can get cheap cider for it"
(P4, female), and "I would probably change what I was drink-
ing . . . cider, or something cheap and nasty . . . [brand of white
cider]" (P18, male); or reducing consumption, in some cases
dramatically, "Phhhh . . . there's no way I could address it . . .
I would actually just need to cut right back or stop" (P5, male)
and ". . . I would really struggle to actually maintain the drink-
ing level . . . I would have to dramatically reduce my alcohol
intake . . . well, I'd have to try" (P15, male).
Some would be prepared to cut back on drink, to keep food
intake constant, "I have to buy all the food, I haven't got any
choice, it's the drinking that has to be cut back on" (P9, male),
whereas others would cut back on food, "I'd still be able to
buy it [alcohol], I'd just do without food" (P16, female), or
not pay bills, borrow money, and get into debt or increase
debt to maintain alcohol consumption, "I'd probably borrow
money off my family members, especially my oldest daugh-
ter . . . that would be my only way round about it" (P13,
female), and ". . . I would just do without heating and I'd have
to rely on my family more . . . or friends" (P17, male).
Other tactics included shopping elsewhere and seeking out
offers. One candidly stated he did not know how he would
procure his alcohol, but "I think it will be drastic, what I would
go to, to get what I need" (P1, male).
O'May et al. 5
Those respondents who were either not drinking at the time
of interview, or had cut down, spoke of "others," saying perhaps
"they" might resort to stealing alcohol, or switch drink type,
. . . if they're that advanced . . . they'll go and get something else.
I don't know what I think about it, but I don't think it would
stop. People will just go onto something cheaper and nastier, if
they really wanted. (P3, male)
Unsurprisingly, the three participants who stated that they
were not short of money were less concerned about any
potential impact of MUP, ". . . it would be a while before I
did that [change brands], because I've got enough money to
pay for it" (P2, male);
. . . we have a bottle of wine amongst 3, every day . . . Pinot noir,
it's good quality wine. So we're not buying the £2 or £3 bottle of
wine. Money is not the issue with us. (P8, male);
and "that doesn't bother me at all, the price of alcohol. I was
buying it anyway. Eh, I don't look at price" (P14, male).
Some participants perceived adverse health consequences
of stopping or suddenly reducing alcohol intake in response
to increased prices, in particular, a fear of seizures by those
who had themselves experienced them, as tolerance/depen-
dence can vary widely, making seizure prediction difficult,
". . . [it] could harm people, especially if you're a right alco-
holic, it could destroy them, it could kill them--just totally
cutting down" (P16, female).
One participant, who had already reduced her alcohol
consumption by approximately two thirds owing to financial
constraints following a bereavement, said she would have to
try to cut down further if prices continued to rise, but this
caused her concern:
If it was to go up quite suddenly, I think my intake would be
reduced again, because of the cost . . . which really worries me,
because at the moment, I'm comfortable in my own wee zone,
because I've turned into a recluse, kind of, since my
[bereavements] . . . it's going to send me into a state of depression
I think, because I'm out of my comfort zone. (P6, female)
Anumber of participants stated that if MUPwere introduced,
they would just have to stop drinking, but could not expand on
how they might do that, other than one who said she would seek
medical treatment, "I would just get myself in somewhere, like
here [detox centre] . . . there would be no way around it for me,
I would just have to ride it out, or get help" (P4, female).
Awareness of MUP and Perceptions of Its
Potential Wider Impact
All participants had been informed about the proposed intro-
duction of an MUP at first, and subsequent, interviews. Some
were aware that the legislation was currently being chal-
lenged, however, several claimed ignorance or did not know
any details. Many expressed resistance to MUP, both from a
personal perspective, as well as on behalf of others. One
view was that people already paid enough tax, and claims
that drinkers and smokers were "clogging up the health ser-
vice" should be counteracted by saying that the government
gained a lot in tax from them, and that MUP ultimately would
hurt people "at the bottom." Another said,
I don't believe MUP will work . . . to me, it's one step away from
prohibition. Alcohol is still going to be available, and it's just
going to be a lot more expensive, and all that will happen is that
people that can afford it anyway, they'll pay it . . . whether or not
they've got an alcohol problem, and people that can't afford it,
and who do have an alcohol problem . . . it's going to lead to a
burgeoning of a black market, which already exists with vodka,
and whisky. (P5, male)
A participant said that while he agreed with MUP in prin-
ciple, because he was drinking heavily again, he would not
welcome it in practice,
My opinion is, if they [drink prices] can put someone like me
into this state, and they can achieve it so easily, then it's a
disgrace . . . I would agree with that [MUP], unfortunately at the
moment I wouldn't. (P1, male)
Another felt that ". . . if it's [MUP] going to help people
and alcoholics, good, but if it's not going to make any differ-
ence, I don't see why they don't just leave it alone" (P7,
male).
With regard to white cider specifically, there was a sug-
gestion that MUP could be beneficial:
. . . I reckon if they kept 50 pence a unit, I think that would be
better, because a lot of people would stop drinking [brand of
white] cider, because I think that's a big, big problem . . . But £4
for 22 units--that's how much a bottle of [brand] is . . . so if they
put it at 50 pence a unit, I think that would work out better. (P12,
male)
It was also suggested that some people might even be per-
suaded to change from white cider to a "nicer drink" or
"trade up" when they compared the prices post-MUP. One
respondent calculated that his current 3-liter bottle of white
cider would virtually triple in price at 50ppu, which he would
no longer be able to afford,
A bottle of [brand of white cider] is going to be almost £10,
that's 3 liters. Currently I could get that or, the cheapest is £3.79,
I think, so you're looking at almost tripling the price.And there's
just no way I could afford that. (P5, male)
A participant who was currently not drinking thought that
the effect of MUP on cheap ciders would "probably be a
good thing" but went on to say that, in his opinion,
if somebody wants to drink, they'll drink. They won't be happy
about the extra price, but if they're an alcoholic or whatever,
they will find a way to pay the money . . . (P7, male)
6 SAGE Open
One participant, for whom money was not an issue, was
positive regarding the proposition of MUP and felt that
50ppu was too cheap, "I would think it should be 60 to 65
pence. That's my view" (P8, male). Another, similarly with-
out financial problems, thought MUP would serve as a
wakeup call, and that any disincentive would be positive,
I suppose it would make me realize just how much money I was
wasting on it, when I could use the money for other things. It
would be a big [sigh] reason to drink less, or stop drinking. It
might not be enough to completely stop me, but it would be a
very big consideration. (P2, male)
Several respondents indicated that they did not feel they
would be personally affected, as they were already paying
more than 50ppu. A retailer's point of view was provided by
a participant whose employment had involved the sale of
alcohol. He was receptive to the prospect of MUP, as a means
of removing the financial advantage perceived to be cur-
rently enjoyed by bulk-buying supermarkets:
. . . if I was still in business, I would have loved minimum
pricing to come in, if I was selling alcohol . . . levelled the
playing field. They couldn't sell stuff cheaper than a certain
amount, and I could probably sell for that price as well. (P14,
male)
One participant suggested that MUP could reduce drink-
ing by younger people, who tend to drink the cheapest drinks,
particularly white cider and vodka, and that a dramatic price
rise might make them think about spending their money on
other items or activities:
. . . it is relatively cheap to go and get blasted for the weekend,
you know, but for somebody to go to the cinema, it's a tenner . . .
or to go swimming, they'd have the bus fare there, the bus fare
back, that's £1.40 . . . plus the price of £3.50 to get into the
swimming pool, that's a fiver. You know, get somebody else to
give us a pound, that's two big bottles of cider! Way hay! . . . it's
too accessible, you know, and everything else is too expensive.
(P20, female)
However, she did not think that MUP would influence
those who were addicted, as "they'll obtain alcohol wherever
and however" (P20), which included driving to England to
obtain cheaper alcohol, buying illicit alcohol, and home brew-
ing. Others similarly predicted the likely failure of MUP,
I don't think there's anything else the politicians can do. If they
introduce minimum pricing, then, they'll just, they'll still drink
the alcohol, em, or they'll be . . . pooling their money to get the
stronger stuff, if that's what they want . . . they'll still get the
alcohol . . . regardless of the price. (P14, male)
None of our participants indicated that they would resort
to drinking illicit alcohol, following the proposed introduc-
tion of MUP; indeed, some stated they were very fearful of
the damage such drink could potentially inflict and would
not touch it, "It might not be ethanol, it might be methanol
that's in it, and you wake up blind or something. I just
wouldn't touch that" (P5, male). Only one participant men-
tioned potentially switching from alcohol to drugs, saying he
would "just buy a bit of dope!" (P3, male).
Discussion
MUP is a whole-population intervention, and the partici-
pants in our study are members of a small but noteworthy
section of the population, many of whom would be dispro-
portionately affected by an increase in alcohol prices, such
as through MUP, owing to the large volume and cheaper
type of alcohol they purchased. Our findings show a range
of views and awareness regarding MUP, and a varied per-
ception of its hypothesized impact consistent with the
demographic spread across Scottish Index of Multiple
Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles, age, and levels of consump-
tion. Participants who were already abstaining, and those
who were considering abstention or reducing their con-
sumption to "safe" levels, were more receptive to MUP
than those who were not. Two participants reported that
they would have to reduce their alcohol purchasing and
consumption if MUP were introduced, owing to financial
constraints, thus supporting the purpose of MUP.
Several respondents struggled to understand the concept of
MUP; they still talked of trading down, using white cider as a
fall back, or making more of an effort to track down special
offers (which would no longer exist). They had not understood
that they would be paying a minimum of 50 pence for each unit
of alcohol (8g ethanol) contained in a drink, with no option to
benefit financially from, for example, bulk buying or purchas-
ing an alternative beverage type. Our quantitative data show
that the mean unit price paid for beer was slightly above 50ppu
(Gill et al., 2015), but, we propose, high alcohol consumption
levels of beer drinkers are supported through the availability of
cheaper drinks such as cider (Black et al., 2014).
It is important that discussion of the potential impact of
MUP does not disregard the addictive nature of alcohol and
its impact on purchasing. Many participants were generally
not able to plan ahead, let alone take account of legislation
that might not be implemented for years, if at all. To them,
MUP was a vague and obscure concept, their attitude was that
they would deal with any issues if, and when, it was in place.
This absence of personal anticipatory preparation for MUP
implementation could have implications for health services,
such as increased emergency hospital admissions and
demands on detox services.
Reducing alcohol harm is a complex problem, requiring
complex solutions. From their global systematic review and
narrative synthesis of 42 studies that focused on alcohol pol-
icy interventions, Diepeveen, Ling, Suhrcke, Roland, and
Marteau (2013) concluded that public acceptability of gov-
ernment interventions to change behavior is greatest for the
O'May et al. 7
least intrusive interventions, which are often the least effec-
tive, and for interventions targeting the behavior of others,
rather than the respondents themselves. They recommend
further research to assess how the presentation of the prob-
lem and the benefits of the intervention might increase
acceptability for those interventions that are more effective
but less acceptable. Results from recent Scottish and English
research (Alcohol Policy Interventions in Scotland and
England [APISE] study) showed that harmful and hazardous
drinkers were less likely to support alcohol policies than
moderate drinkers, but that the majority of respondents
believed that the government has a responsibility and should
be doing more to tackle harms caused by alcohol. Opinion on
how they should be doing this, and who they should be tar-
geting, however, was not clear (Li, 2014).
Lonsdale, Hardcastle, and Hagger (2012) reported skepti-
cism regarding effectiveness of MUP as a means to reduce
alcohol consumption from a sample of 218 members of differ-
ent community groups in England, of whom 10 were hazard-
ous drinkers, but none was a dependent drinker. In our study,
many participants did not feel that any proposed alcohol policy
was going to help them, but that the introduction of, for exam-
ple, MUP, might reduce the likelihood of younger people
developing the same drinking patterns and harms that they had.
Instead of perpetuating the perception that alcohol misuse
is largely an individual problem best avoided and managed
through education, counseling, and medical treatment, Groves
(2010), among others, has suggested that for the United
Kingdom, the health and societal costs of alcohol misuse are
best prevented through legislation on pricing and marketing.
In this vein, portraying alcohol policy as a broad, multi-sec-
toral, public health issue that requires a whole-population
approach has been crucial to policy development in Scotland
(Katikireddi, Bond, & Hilton, 2014). However, certain indi-
viduals and/or groups of people, such as those with alcohol-
related harm interviewed in this study, may be affected more
than others, perhaps by some unintended consequences. If
MUP were introduced, the population effect (Meng, Hill-
McManus, Brennan, & Meier, 2012) might be delayed. The
lower-risk drinkers in Scotland could either over time reduce
their consumption, decide to pay a bit more to maintain it, or
even stockpile some cheaper pre-MUP alcohol. However, for
the people we interviewed, who have a high frequency of pur-
chasing and high expenditure owing to the high volumes pur-
chased, the impact of MUP would be immediate, particularly
so for white cider and cheap vodka drinkers.
Certainly, evidence shows that increasing the price of alco-
hol reduces harms of various types, and indicates that depen-
dent drinkers are no exception to the rule that alcohol
consumers respond to changes in alcohol prices (Babor et al.,
2010). While a reduction in hospital admissions over time
would be one anticipated effect of MUP, in the shorter term,
the impact may be an increase and, if imposed during the win-
ter months, an exacerbation of the general season-associated
increase due to respiratory conditions and influenza (Scottish
Government, 2015). The timing of its introduction should be
carefully considered, in addition to the potential impact on
quality of life, as many of our participants mentioned the com-
peting financial demands of purchasing alcohol, buying food,
and paying household bills.
Consequential changes in demands on treatment facilities
also merit consideration. A recent survey of specialist alcohol
treatment services in Scotland identified ongoing issues relat-
ing to service gaps, service planning, staffing, demand, and
missed appointments (cited in Beeston et al., 2014, p. 16).
Stockwell, Williams, and Pauly (2012) found that in British
Columbia, when heavy drinkers were asked what they did if
money was short, many said they applied for treatment.
Sudden alcohol withdrawal is dangerous for dependent drink-
ers, in the most serious cases causing seizures. At the last esti-
mate for Scotland, only one in four alcohol dependent drinkers
was accessing alcohol services (Beeston et al., 2014), and
Wallhed-Finn, Bakshi, and Andreasson (2014) reported that a
minority of those with alcohol dependence seek and undergo
treatment. All participants in our study have received treat-
ment relating to their drinking at least once (their recruitment
site), but there are likely many more (whose numbers we do
not know) who have not engaged with services, or received
support. If MUP is introduced, trading down to cheaper alco-
hol will no longer be an option, impacting on those already
using services, but also potentially on an unknown number of
people with alcohol dependence who are not.
Any unintended increases in the numbers contacting health
and/or social care would likely be short term, following the
implementation of an MUP, and could well be counterbalanced
by falls in service use over a longer time period, due to reduced
consumption within a much larger section of the population.
Within the heavy drinking population, arguably there might be
a greater demand for treatment services (e.g., detox, counsel-
ing, etc.) but a subsequent fall in emergency admissions due to
accidents, bleeds, or myocardial infarction, for example,
because of medically significant reductions in consumption.
MUP is not a tax and any increased revenue from an
increased unit in price is proposed to be returned to the
retailer, who will also be at liberty to increase the price of
any drink, not just those that are currently sold under the
50ppu (Sheffield Alcohol Research Group, n.d.). One poten-
tial measure would be to annex part of the retailers' antici-
pated profits and ring-fence for treatment services, in the
form of a hypothecated tax, which would likely prove to be
highly controversial (see, for example, Keable-Elliott, 2014).
One criticism of MUP is the potential for an increase in
sales of illicit alcohol (Hilton, Wood, Patterson, & Katikireddi,
2014; Katikireddi, Bond, & Hilton, 2014). Several participants
referred to its availability, while many stated they would
actively avoid illicit alcohol due to safety concerns. Whether
they would reconsider this view when finances are extremely
stretched--with a choice between more expensive (legal)
drinks and much cheaper (illegal) alcohol of unknown prove-
nance and potential safety hazards--is not known.

Strengths and Limitations
Our study has a number of strengths. To our knowledge, this
is the first published study that explores the perceptions and
behaviors of heavy drinkers with regard to alcohol policy in
Scotland, both extant and proposed, and provides insight into
how members of a certain minority group felt they might be
impacted by a population-level policy. Opinions and atti-
tudes do not, of course, necessarily predict behavior, and are
likely colored by current drinking status. Data were collected
at an interesting time in the policy debate and complement
existing research, which has, thus far, primarily focused on
stakeholders' perspectives, such as those in the public and
voluntary sector, as well as industry representatives (Carrell,
2014; Katikireddi, Bond, & Hilton, 2014; Katikireddi,
Hilton, et al., 2014; Meng, Hill-McManus, Brennan, &
Meier, 2012; Scottish Government, 2012).
A key limitation was the attrition rate of the study, which
meant that at time of interview, the number of potential
recruits available to sample had reduced from 639 to 165. In
addition, as more than 100 of the attritions were attributed to
death, we may not have been able to recruit those who were
drinking the most (although we have presented their con-
sumption figures at baseline, see Table 1). Certainly, evidence
shows that increasing the price of alcohol reduces harms of
various types, and indicates that dependent drinkers are no
exception to the rule that alcohol consumers respond to
changes in alcohol prices (Babor et al., 2010). While a reduc-
tion in hospital admissions over time would be one antici-
pated effect of MUP, in the shorter term, the impact may be an
increase, and, if imposed during the winter months, an exac-
erbation of the general season-associated increase due to
respiratory conditions and influenza (Scottish Government,
2015). The timing of its introduction should be carefully con-
sidered. Some participants were not drinking at the time of
the interview, and so they were describing actions in the past,
or hypothesizing with regard to how they might purchase
alcohol, now, or in the future, so we have no way of knowing
whether or how their purchasing habits would be affected.
However, on average, from our data, each participant would
be required to increase expenditure by 21% to obtain the
equivalent number of units should MUP at 50ppu be intro-
duced. Put another way, the potential reduction in unit con-
sumption induced by MUP if participants did, or could, not
increase their expenditure, would be 24% (total sample), but
for the sub-group drinking exclusively white cider, their con-
sumption would need to drop by 66% (Gill et al., 2015).
Conclusion
Our findings provide important and relevant insights into the
views and drinking practices of the heaviest consumers of alco-
hol. MUP has the potential to reduce alcohol-related harms on
multiple levels, impacting on drinkers across the spectrum. The
unique pattern of drinking described by this group underscores
the need for a more accurate modeling, such as with the
Sheffield model, of the potential ramifications of MUP. There
are challenges associated with securing relevant informing
data, and population surveys have significant shortcomings in
this regard. MUP is likely to impact positively on a large pro-
portion of drinkers, including some heavy drinkers, but it may
have some short-term implications for a small group of depen-
dent drinkers, some of whom may be unable to cut down on
their alcohol consumption, and others who would need to sud-
denly cut down drastically. Both of these scenarios may have
unintendeddetrimentalconsequences,whichshouldbeplanned
for and resourced appropriately. From our small study, we sug-
gest that preventive and anticipatory approaches, targeted at
those whose consumption causes them harm, could go a long
way to making life better for all those who suffer from alcohol-
related harm. In addition, further qualitative investigation
regarding barriers and facilitators to reducing alcohol con-
sumption among heavy drinkers, in response to increased alco-
hol prices, would be welcome.
