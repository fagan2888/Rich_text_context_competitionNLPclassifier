Introduction
Essential hypertension is a common risk factor for cardio-
vascular diseases (CVDs). Except for lifestyle modifica-
tion, drug therapy is the main treatment strategy. A
single-pill combination (SPC) of two drugs is recom-
mended by several recent international guidelines for
hypertension,1,2 including the Chinese guidelines of 20103
for the treatment of hypertension in high-risk patients who
require marked blood pressure (BP) reductions. The China
STATUS II (Survey of hyperTensive pAtienTs blood
pressUre control rate in clinic Service) is a prospective,
multicentre, open-label, post-marketing, observational
study; including 11,312 Chinese adults (aged  18 years)

Abstract
Background: The China STATUS II is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, post-marketing, observational study
including Chinese adults (aged  18 years) with essential hypertension who were prescribed once-daily valsartan/
amlodipine (Val/Aml 80/5 mg) single-pill combination. In order to examine gender differences in treatment response to
Val/Aml, we further analysed data from the China STATUS II study.
Methods: A total of 11,312 patients (6456 (57%) men and 4856 (43%) women) received the Val/Aml treatment for 8
weeks. After the treatment, we compared the proportion of patients not achieving the target systolic blood pressure
(SBP: < 140 mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP: < 90 mm Hg) in different age groups (by Fisher exact probability
test) and estimated the changes in blood pressure (BP) according to age and gender, using a mixed model.
Results: At enrolment, mean SBP was higher in the female versus the male patients (160.0 ± 12.71 versus 159.3 ±
12.31 mm Hg; p = 0.003), whereas the mean DBP was higher in the male versus the female patients (96.4 ± 10.65 versus
94.5 ± 10.72 mm Hg; p < 0.001). The overall proportion of women not achieving the target BP was less than that of
men (57.41% versus 59.59%; p < 0.05) at 4 weeks and (22.22% versus 23.78%; p < 0.05) at 8 weeks after the Val/Aml
treatment. Among both men and women, the proportion of patients not achieving the target SBP increased with age;
however, the proportion not achieving the target DBP decreased with age. The mixed-model analysis showed that the
changes in SBP were closely related to gender, indicating that the SBP-lowering effect after Val/Aml treatment might be
better in women. In addition, the changes in DBP were closely related to age.
Conclusions: Gender might be a factor for consideration in the decision-making process of individualised antihypertensive
therapy, in the future.

with essential hypertension, who were prescribed a once-
daily valsartan/amlodipine (Val/Aml, 80/5 mg) SPC.
China STATUS II is the first evidence-based, real-world
data in Chinese hypertensive patients, which shows the
efficacy and safety of the Val/Aml SPC.4
It is well known that young adult women have lower BP
than age-matched men; but the prevalence of CVDs,
including hypertension in women, increases rapidly after
the onset of menopause. Recent studies show a few possi-
ble causes for gender-related differences in CVDs, such as:
The change in female hormonal status and the loss of car-
diovascular protection provided by oestrogen.5­7 Although
numerous studies report gender-related differences in the
regulation of arterial pressure and renal function by the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS)8­10 and the response to
RAS inhibition,11­13 there is no mention of the selection of
antihypertensive drugs based on gender, except in preg-
nancy-related situations, in any of the guidelines world-
wide. Moreover, insufficient gender-specific data has been
provided by clinical trials,14 making it difficult to optimise
drug selection for both genders. In order to understand
gender differences in BP management, we examined the
effect of gender on the efficacy of Val/Aml SPC in the
China STATUS II study.
Methods
Study design and participants
The study design for China STATUS II has been reported
elsewhere.4 To summarise, China STATUS II was a multi-
centre, post-marketing, prospective, observational study,
which enrolled 11,312 adult Chinese patients with essen-
tial hypertension whose BP was not adequately controlled
by monotherapy.
All enrolled patients had a mean sitting systolic BP
(SBP)  140 mm Hg ( 130 mm Hg for diabetes or chronic
kidney disease (CKD)) and/or a mean sitting diastolic BP
(DBP)  90 mm Hg ( 80 mm Hg for diabetes or CKD),
whose BP was inadequately controlled by monotherapy.
Before enrolment, all patients provided written informed
consent. The study complied with the International
Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice
(ICH-GCP) and applicable local regulations in China, and
was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the First
Hospital of Harbin Medical University. All procedures fol-
lowed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the
responsible committee on human experimentation (institu-
tional and national) and with the Declaration of Helsinki of
1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008.
The baseline characteristics of the randomised patients
are described in the report of the China STATUS II study's
main findings.4
Eligible patients from 238 regional centres across 29
provinces of China were enrolled from 12 October 2010 to
20 February 2012. After enrolment, there was no dietary,
lifestyle nor medication change in all subjects. The lifestyle
questionnaires included questions on education and socio-
economic status, occupation, history of previous illness and
disorders or surgical operations, lifetime history of con-
sumption of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, and physical
activity. All patients who had stopped taking other antihy-
pertensive drugs received Val/Aml 80/5 mg SPC for 4
weeks, instead of their previous antihypertensive drugs.
The initial BP target (< 140/90 mm Hg (or < 130/80 mm Hg
for diabetes or CKD)) was unified to < 140/90 mm Hg, for
easier management. The treatment was in accordance with
the routine clinical outpatient practice in China. The study
duration was 8 weeks, with a follow-up every 4 weeks. If a
patient did not achieve BP control at the end of 4 weeks of
the SPC, an additional antihypertensive agent could be
added, according to the physician's decision.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS® soft-
ware version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA),
witha2-sidedsignificancelevel(p)of<0.05.Demographic
and baseline variables were summarised using descriptive
statistics, including the mean, SD, median, minimum and
maximum values for numeric variables; and the count
number and percentage for the categorical variables. We
used the T test, chi-square test and Fisher accurate proba-
bility test.
We estimated the changes in SBP and DBP at 4 and 8
weeks for gender and age as fixed effects, by using SAS
PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).15 For the
analysis in Mixed Model 1, we calculated variance compo-
nents for the baseline BP, their BMI, smoking, drinking,
exercise and education level, using gender and age as fixed
effects. The same analysis was then used in Mixed Model
2, adjusting for the baseline BP and statistically significant
effects in Model 1.
Results
Demographic and baseline characteristics
The detailed demographic and baseline characteristics of
the patients are presented in Table 1. We analysed a total of
11,312 patients (6456 (57%) men and 4856 (43%) women).
At enrolment, the men were younger in age (p < 0.001) and
had a higher BMI (p < 0.001) than women. Compared with
the female patients, we observed a higher educational
background, more physical activity, and more smoking
and drinking in the male patients (p < 0.05). There were no
significant differences in their present cardiovascular risk
factors and medical history, and their previous use of anti-
hypertensive drug classes, between these men and women
(Table 1).

Blood pressure during follow-up
SBP was higher in the female patients versus the male
patients (160.0 ± 12.71 versus 159.3 ± 12.31 mm Hg; p =
0.003); whereas DBP was higher in male patients versus
female patients, at enrolment (96.4 ± 10.65 versus 94.5 ±
10.72 mm Hg; p < 0.001).
After the treatment, a significantly lower proportion of
women did not achieve the target BP, compared with men
(57.41% versus 59.59%, p < 0.05 at 4 weeks; and 22.22%
versus 23.78%, p < 0.05, at 8 weeks). In order to examine
the effect of age on drug efficacy, both genders were
divided into four different age groups: < 55, 55­64, 65­75
and > 75 years. As a result, for all enrolled patients, the
proportion of patients not achieving the target SBP
increased with age; however, the proportion of patients not
achieving the target DBP was the opposite (Figure 1).
The next assessment included the changes in SBP and
DBP at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, according to gender
and age, by using SAS PROC MIXED. The p values
obtained from the Mixed Model were as follows: Changes
in SBP at 4 weeks, p < 0.0001 for gender and p = 0.3832

and p = 0.0225 for age; changes in DBP at 4 weeks, p =
0.0602 for gender and p = 0.0219 for age; changes in DBP
at 8 weeks, p = 0.1035 for gender and p = 0.0057 for age.
In the Mixed Model 1 analysis, age and gender were fixed
effects and the baseline BP, BMI, smoking, drinking, exer-
cise and education level were random effects. There was
no significant correlation between the patients' age, gen-
der, BMI, smoking, drinking, exercise and education level.
The Mixed Model 2 was adjusted for the baseline BP
and statistically significant effects in the Model 1. That
mixed model showed that the changes in SBP were
closely related to gender. Given that the proportion of the
women who did not achieve the target BP was lower as
compared with the men in this study, the SBP-lowering
effect of the Val/Aml treatment might be better in women.
In addition, the changes in DBP were closely related to
age. These findings were consistent in both Mixed Model
1 and Mixed Model 2 (Table 2).
Discussion
One major finding of our study was that a gender differ-
ence existed in the treatment response to Val/Aml among
Chinese hypertension patients, indicating that this therapy
might show better SBP-lowering effects in women.
Major gender differences exist in the development and
progression of hypertension and CVD. Before menopause,
women usually have lower BP and less hypertension and
CVD, relative to age-matched men16,17; however, this car-
diovascular protection in women is lost after menopause.18
Several studies confirm that gender differences exist in
terms of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic char-
acteristics of drugs.19­21 Wing et al.22 shows that treatment

with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cor-
relates with a better outcome, compared with treatment
with diuretics; whereas another study concludes that the
response to specific treatment agents appears to differ
between men and women.23 These findings also suggested
that antihypertensive regimens need to be tailored accord-
ing to gender. Some might argue that female patients are
always more aware of the need for treatment and show bet-
ter compliance; thus, could get a better BP-lowering effect.
We also evaluated both the physician and patients' self-
compliance assessments, and found that there were
no significant differences between the male and female
genders (p = 0.7517 and p = 0.0702, respectively). Also,
given that the longitudinal BP response was appropriate in
both men and women and that the study length was short,
we did not consider male patients lacking compliance in
our study. Although the cause for these gender-related dif-
ferences in response to therapy is not certain, these gender
differences are associated with sexual dimorphism in the
physiological mechanisms that regulate arterial pressure,
which can impact the male and female patients' responses
to different therapeutic approaches.24

Notably, gender-related differences also exist in the
RAS, due to differential modulation by sex hormones.25,26 In
our study, most patients were aged > 55 years (6601/11,312
(58%)); and of these, 46% (3058/6601) of them were
women. Given that the mean post-menopausal age is 56
years in China,27 quite a few women in our study were in the
post-menopausal period. Oestrogen regulates all compo-
nents of the RAS, increasing the synthesis of angiotensino-
gen, while decreasing the synthesis and activity of renin and
ACE. Oestrogen decreases the expression of the angiotensin
Type 1 receptor (AT1
R) in target tissue, but increases the
expression of Type 2 receptor AT2
R.28,29 Studies in animal
models show that oestrogen and RAS blockade may act syn-
ergistically to downregulate the AT1
R.30,31 Since valsartan is
an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), the Val/Aml com-
bination therapy might inhibit RAS activation and provide a
better antihypertensive effect for post-menopausal women.
A small study among 51 post-menopausal hypertensive
women showed that the BP-lowering effect of the ARB
irbesartan is augmented by co-administration with 17-estra-
diol, suggesting there are potentiating effects of the two dif-
ferent antihypertensive mechanisms.32 Of course, further
study into the mechanisms of the gender differences in
hypertension treatment is needed.
Another finding of our study was that for all of the
enrolled patients, the proportion of patients not achieving
the target SBP ( 140 mm Hg) increased with age; how-
ever, the proportion of patients not achieving the target
DBP ( 90 mm Hg) was the opposite.
Elevated BP is an important cardiovascular risk factor.
Although the target DBP and SBP are defined by guidelines,
DBPhas historically taken precedence in hypertension man-
agement; however, there is strong evidence that SBP is
superior to DBP as a predictor of cardiovascular events, par-
ticularly in the elderly.33 Stamler et al.34 found that SBP has
a stronger association with cardiovascular risk, as compared
withDBP,inmiddle-agedandelderlyindividuals.Moreover,
the superior predictive ability of SBP was also confirmed in
a meta-analysis of 61 prospective observational studies that
recorded BP and cause-specific mortality.35 With an increas-
ing proportion of aging population, the prevalence of hyper-
tension and related cardiovascular morbidity in Asian
patients continues to rise, placing a substantial and escalat-
ing social and economic burden on this region.36 The preva-
lence of hypertension in the Chinese population is 39%
overall, 59.4% in those aged > 60 years and 72.8% in those
aged > 75 years.37 The age-specific prevalence of hyperten-
sion increased with age, throughout the age range. In our
study, the mean age of the male patients was 57.4 ± 14.27
years and that of female patients was 59.8 ± 13.09 years.
The proportion of patients who did not achieve the target
SBP increased with age. An elevated SBP increases the risk
of CVD, mortality and renal function decline, and that risk
may increase at lower SBP levels in the Asian than in the
Western population. Hence, reducing SBP should be the
primary goal in the management of hypertension, particu-
larly as the patients age.38
There were several limitations in our study. First, the
focus was only on short-term BP lowering. The long-term
clinical outcomes might be more important in elucidating
gender differences and cardiovascular events. Besides, 686
(6.06%) of the subjects of this study had to take additional
antihypertensive agents to control their BP. The most used
combined antihypertensive agents were metoprolol (1.67%)
and hydrochlorothiazide (1.45%). Because the majority
(10,626 out of 11,312 (93.94%)) of the subjects in this
study received only Val/Aml SPC for BP control, we con-
sider that the potential impact of additional antihyperten-
sive treatment on the BP outcome is limited. We will avoid
this kind of possible bias in future studies. Moreover, we
did not control or monitor the patients' sodium or protein
intake, although that could be extremely difficult to imple-
ment in such a large-scale observational study.
Conclusions
For all the patients enrolled in our study, the proportion of
patients not achieving the target SBP increased with age;
however, the proportion not achieving the target DBP was
the opposite. Although the mechanisms responsible for
gender differences in the treatment response to Val/Aml
among Chinese patients were not addressed, our findings
indicated that women might have a better SBP-lowering
effect with such therapy. Gender might be a factor for con-
sideration in the decision-making process of individual-
ised antihypertensive therapy, in the future.
