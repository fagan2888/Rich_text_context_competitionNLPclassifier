Abstract
This paper builds off the Our Data Ourselves research project, which examined ways of understanding and reclaiming the
data that young people produce on smartphone devices. Here we explore the growing usage and centrality of mobiles in
the lives of young people, questioning what data-making possibilities exist if users can either uncover and/or capture what
data controllers such as Facebook monetize and share about themselves with third-parties. We outline the MobileMiner,
an app we created to consider how gaining access to one's own data not only augments the agency of the individual but of
the collective user. Finally, we discuss the data making that transpired during our hackathon. Such interventions in the
enclosed processes of datafication are meant as a preliminary investigation into the possibilities that arise when young
people are given back the data which they are normally structurally precluded from accessing.

Introduction
Ever since the Snowden revelations in June 2013 there
has been a growing awareness of the depth and breadth
of the data we generate and how it renders us into ever
more traceable objects of surveillance. The profoundly
asymmetrical, political economic dimensions of the
production and circulations of data have led to deeply
problematic power relations wherein every keystroke,
website visited or application downloaded are now rich
sites of potential surplus value. With the proliferation
of mobile platforms, digital footprints are expanding
rapidly, especially those of young people.
Teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 are spending
more time on their mobiles and less time accessing social
media platforms on their Internet browsers. Nielsen stu-
dies show that mobile phone data usage of young people
tripled in 2011 (Nielsen, 2011; Osborn, 2012). Platforms
such as Facebook can now regularly gather data from
over 500 million active users via their Messenger app, in
addition to the 30 billion messages that pass daily
through their recently acquired WhatsApp (Weisenthal,
2014). In the United Kingdom, 81 percent of teenagers
have access to a mobile (Spence, 2013), alongside 88
percent in the United States (Lenhart, 2015). And yet,
little is known about the different ways in which apps
generate and share data.
When using an Internet browser on a laptop, desk-
top, mobile or otherwise, there are a number of avail-
able plugins such as DisconnectMe or Lightbeam
which, to varying degrees, reveal and in some instances
block third-party marketing and analytic companies
from gathering personal social data.1 Browsers such
as Chrome, Safari or Firefox ­ the primary windows
onto the Internet from a desktop or laptop computer ­
also offer methods in their preferences or plugins for
blocking or clearing some of the unwanted cookies.
By contrast, while an app such as DisconnetMe
can be downloaded for users to retain some data con-
trol when browsing on their mobiles, for the most
part, individual apps offer their users even less con-
trol over the data being gathered and/or shared
(Han et al., 2012). Given the growing usage and cen-
trality of the smartphone in the lives of young people,
we see an urgent need to understand and unpack ques-
tions around a) the extent to which data is produced

and shared by the apps that teenagers routinely down-
load; b) how this routine extraction of data impacts
how young people negotiate and conceptualize digital
privacy; and c) what agentic `data-making' possibilities
exist if users can either uncover and/or capture what
data controllers monetize and share about themselves
with third-parties. Thus our research focuses on what
we call big social data (Cote
´ , 2014; Manovich, 2011);
that is, the data we produce through our mediated cul-
tural and communicative practices both on the Internet
and now on mobile devices.
The leaky mobile ecosystem
According to Han et al. (2012), mobile applications
or apps are an inherently `leakier' medium; that is,
they extract more personally identifiable information
compared to platforms that run off a desktop browser.
The configuration of the mobile's intensive data flow
is in part rooted in the infrastructure of applications
that do not necessarily distinguish between first and
third-parties (Egele et al., 2011; Enck et al., 2010). To
clarify, the first party represents the app proprietor
such as Facebook or Google or Candy Crush.
Conversely, the third-party represents a tracking body
that has been granted access to a user's data via the first
party, typically for commercial purposes (although not
exclusively). Web browsers, unlike apps, entail proto-
cological restrictions between first and third-parties,
which have been established by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). However, Han et al.'s research
suggests that both Android and iPhone applications
can and do share the device and SIM identifiers ­
such as the user's phone number ­ thereby providing
personally identifiable information about the user to
third-parties. The problem, they argue, is that ``this
means that mobile third-party tracking may be done
with identifiers that allowed activity to be linked to
people over long periods of time'' (2012: 3). In addition,
the mobile ecosystem offers what Han et al. refer to as
sensor data, that is, sensitive data such as location,
images and audio from smartphones. The combination
of both real world names and sensor data that can now
be easily gathered are allowing for even richer and more
hyper individuated data profiles.
Coming to terms with the leakiness of the app eco-
system is critical given that our time spent within these
siloed environments is only increasing. In the US, a
2014 study performed by ComCast revealed that 60
percent of people's time spent online transpires on
smartphones, compared to on browsers (Perez, 2014).
Young people are in the vanguard of this trend, with 91
percent of teenagers in the US regularly reaching for
smartphones and the ubiquitous connectivity that they
offer (Lenhart, 2015). The increasing use of applications
on mobile devices does not, however, mean that they are
unaware of the compromises required to manage their
digital privacy. Raines-Goldie (2010) and Marwick and
Boyd (2014) have demonstrated how young people deal
with such challenges, and draw on highly developed stra-
tegies to obfuscate aspects of themselves within the
public platforms they are using. In short, they have
learned to hide in the open.
Despite looking for ways in which they can control
their online identity, young people often feel caught in
what has been referred to as a `privacy paradox'
(Acquisti and Grossklags, 2005; Shklovski et al., 2014).
In other words, there is a strong sentiment that levels of
data surveillance are simply `creepy' or rather too intim-
ate. Yet this sentiment notwithstanding, most appear
resigned to pressing `agree' to the countless number of
`terms and conditions' agreements, which function lar-
gely to safeguard and legitimize the extraction and mon-
etization of data (Kim, 2014; Shklovski et al., 2014).
Privacy policies and terms and conditions, virtually
non-existent prior to 1998, have since become: ``the pri-
mary legal instruments conveying representations to con-
sumers regarding third-party data sharing'' (Kim, 2014:
328). Scholars such as Shklovski et al. (2014) have been
trying to come to terms with this imbalanced relationship
wherein the access users are granted to mobile apps
ultimately surrenders their social and cultural data to
private interests. And yet, while users may feel ``out-
raged'' or ``express dismay'', they proceed with ``business
as usual'', going back to the same routine habits that only
intensify those processes of extraction (2014: 8).
As Crawford and Boyd argue, it is not simply the
amount or size of the data being extracted that matters;
rather, what requires our attention is the inherent
potential value derived from its relationality with
other data points (2012). Here, value is not simply
being derived from the petabytes of information being
extracted, instead it comes out of a newfound capacity
to process large volumes of data from a multitude of
different structured and unstructured points, at increas-
ingly higher velocities (Kitchin, 2014). As such, the data
that is generated via our social relations online has
gained a newfound depth and breadth of potential
due to its varied form, routine generation and new
modes of algorithmic processing.
Datafication to data making
Mayer-Schou
¨ nberger and Cukier (2013) refer to datafi-
cation as a process of the quantification of the world
into data that is in turn reconstituted into new forms of
value. Their emphasis is on its potential for analysis,
predictive and otherwise, that they believe provides pre-
viously unavailable kinds of insights. We find datafica-
tion useful for our research in identifying an emergent
2 Big Data & Society
object of study: the quotidian data we generate. This
`born digital' material is distinct from digitisation,
wherein analogue cultural expression is converted into
digital form, the traditional focus of digital humanities.
For Mayer-Schou
¨ nberger and Cukier, datafication is
presented primarily via the data-driven economy which
creates the conditions for mediated social and cultural
practices and expression to be repurposed and trans-
formed into a quantified format ­ unlocking the poten-
tial to create something new that lies dormant within the
data. Google Books is an exemplar. Scanning millions of
books, hence datafying hundreds of millions of data
points on every page that entered their vast digital arch-
ive, ultimately led to the creation of a new asset ­ Google
Translate. Value for Google was not a simple effect of
the data they extracted from all of the books they
scanned; instead, it came through realising the relational
potential within those datasets to create what is now the
most used translation platform in the world. Such a pro-
cess is not necessarily forthcoming; for example, there is
no Amazon Translate, despite their extensive digitisation
of books for Kindle. In both instances, Google and
Amazon had access to a massive archive of digitized
and datafied books and yet only Google sought to lever-
age the potential in their data sets into a new service that
would generate even more data.
Datafication is therefore not a straightforward pro-
cess that transforms analogue or digital material into
quantifiable data for the production of surplus value. It
is equally about recombination; therein finding expres-
sions of relationality that are inherently possible among
mutable data points. The multivalent variability of data
that allows it to be constantly reimagined, signals that
value is not necessarily forthcoming through mere
access to a large data set. Instead, value is produced
in the algorithms that are programmed to ask different
questions, across different data sets, allowing for new
forms of recombination and reuse.
Datafication, however, as presented by Mayer-
Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier suffers from what we call the
resolution of verisimilitude. We intend a double articu-
lation of resolution denoting i) the will and determin-
ation of those who assert that with enough data we can
know the world, and ii) the ever more finely granulated
data points that are meant to render it transparent and
true. We question such faith in data plenitude, an
n ¼ all reality where empirical analysis is transformed
into an automated algorithmic effect as subsequent pre-
dictive analytics become fact.
Other interlocutors share such reservations. Van
Dijck, for instance, notes that the concept of datafication
is ``rooted in problematic ontological and epistemo-
logical claims'' (2014: 198) and should not be regarded
as a neutral process. Instead, it is predicated on both
access and the capacity to generate new forms of value
from preexisting and newly acquired data. Elsewhere
Cote
´ has referred to this asymmetrical process as data
motility (2014). This denotes the way in which from the
moment we tap send, the data we generate richly circu-
lates almost wholly outside of our control, yet remains
profoundly tethered to us, enabling and constraining our
conditions of possibility.
The relevance of datafication to our work is two-fold.
First, it demonstrates a new materiality of data wherein
cheap memory, powerful processors, algorithms and
machine learning quantify our world and selves.
Secondly, it raises questions of agency within this pro-
cess. Mayer-Schou
¨ nberger and Cukier's framing of data-
fication fails to move beyond the uncritical capture and
transformation of data for economic gain. However,
according to O'Neil (2013), this increasingly pervasive
process needs to account for who is actually controlling
and framing the data and for what purpose. In short,
important questions which appear to be absent in
Mayer-Schou
¨ nberger and Cukier's account of
datafication.
Vis (2013) furthers this critique through a nuanced
reckoning of the ways data is shaped by everything
from application program interfaces (APIs) to data
mining methods to researcher motivation. She notes
how these processes of `data making' create myriad
challenges for researchers both in terms of data access
and quality. We concur that there is a need for further
critical examination of the methods and tools, espe-
cially as a means for rebalancing agency within data-
intensive ecosystems. Foregrounding `making data' in
processes of datafication can highlight the asymmetry
that demarcates this socio-technical assemblage of
access and capacities, especially in terms of the ability
to activate the transformational potentialities located in
the data itself. Whether it be a researcher accessing
a Twitter feed, or someone using their smartphone,
identifying the `whom' and `how' of data making is
not so simple.
Datafication frames us as primarily passive gener-
ators in the social life of Big Data. Conversely, valoris-
ing `making data' opens the possibility of becoming
more active. In the context of datafication, the drive
towards `making data' can thus be seen as a strategic
mode of agency that can arise if the subjects of datafi-
cation are given tools to both understand and work
with the data that they produce. Innovative methods
can provide insight into that which is regularly being
captured about users. Our research approach is but one
of many possible ways of understanding the social life
of the data we generate, wherein we might be able to
critically leverage the spirit of Jenkins' `participatory
culture' (2006) into a realm of Big Data. However, we
don't simply want to celebrate our capacity to produce
and widely share content, we need to gain clearer
Pybus et al. 3
insight into the extensive ecosystem in which our data is
already participating. The approach we took sought to
enable the YRSers to become data-makers. Similar to
Nick Couldry (2014), we see a need for new kinds of
innovative research that examines how we can take up
and use analytics more autonomously.
Data literacy can act as an extension and updating
of traditional discourses around media literacy2 by
refocusing our attention to the material conditions
that surround a user's data within highly proprietary
digitised environments. Given the growing imbalance
between those who produce data and those who pro-
duce value from that data, there is a need to open up
new forms of digital literacies, such as privacy literacies,
information literacies, code literacies, algorithmic lit-
eracies, database literacies and so forth.
Puschmann and Burgess (2013) reach a similar end
point in their work on the politics of Twitter's ecosystem.
If a user does not understand how they can leverage their
API, nor understand its technical constraints, then they
are unable to effectively interact with the platform. As a
result, mainly corporate actors or those who are techno-
logically adept and/or possess the resources can meaning-
fully engage with the data that is being collectively
produced. Similarly, we are interested in what happens
when closed data becomes open, to reveal what young
people regularly generate but typically cannot access.
In trying to unpack the processes by which data is col-
lected, brokered, aggregated, analysed, monetized and
acted upon, we conceived of our project as an initial
step toward the development of a holistic approach to
data literacy. One that is able to both question how
meaning is constructed and (re)presented from the data
but equally seeks to unpack those opaque material pro-
cesses that enable this capture and (re)presentation
alongside the active (re)shaping of data infrastructures.
Mobile methodologies: Our Data
Ourselves
We have taken an interdisciplinary approach with a
research team comprised of media and cultural theor-
ists, computer scientists, programmers and youth. The
gambit has been that such a grouping would enable a
rigorous exploration of our data to facilitate a critical
intervention into the datafication of youth cultures via
the mobile phone. Our focus has been on the asymmet-
rical power relations that are deeply imbricated in the
structural ways in which data is produced by and yet
flows away from the user.
To begin, we set out to work with a very specific
demographic of young people between the ages of 14
and 18 years old. The participants were all affiliated
with Young Rewired State (YRS). This non-profit,
UK based organization brings together communities
of youth who have an interest in coding. By using pro-
ject-focused learning, young people work in groups to
improve their coding, alongside both peers and men-
tors. The members of YRS are also given opportunities
to experiment with new technologies, software and
computer languages while being actively encouraged
to turn their ideas into real prototypes at different
hackathon events. The pre-existing rich computer lit-
eracies that these young people possessed were seen as
an asset to our project, enabling us to establish both a
co-learning and research relationship.
There is a wide range of participatory research meth-
ods (cf. Reason and Bradbury, 2008) yet we use co-
research in explicit reference to the politicised methods
of conricerca, evoking the Italian operaismo, or `work-
erist' movement dating back to the 1960s. The subse-
quent conricerca or co-research method developed as
both the production of knowledge and organisation.
Our method is also situated within the expansive field
of action research given the opacity of the material
infrastructures that predominantly govern our data
beyond our understanding or control. Our partnership
with YRS marked an opportunity to examine the data
produced by mobile apps without reproducing those
conditions which render individuals powerless against
the ubiquitous data sharing that transpires with eco-
nomic and political third-parties. In short, we did not
simply want to use our subjects as data producers,
instead we wanted to imagine what a data literate sub-
ject might look like.
Collaboration with our participants was therefore
critical. From the beginning we expected the YRSers
to help us access the data they were generating within
their mobile environments and then analyse what had
been collected through the creation of different appli-
cations. The endpoint, however, was not to realize a
completed prototype but rather to observe their heur-
istic process and approach, which could potentially
facilitate different pedagogical practices for those who
do not have the same technological expertise. We thus
found resonance with action based research methodol-
ogies, such as those described by Baym (2013) and
Kennedy et al. (2014) who specifically argue in favour
of ``small-scale, qualitative studies [which] open up a
space for reflecting on the affordances of digital meth-
ods'' (p. 174). Similarly, Coleman's study of the myriad
technologically savvy direct actions taken by Lulz
and Anonymous (2011) points to the creative possibi-
lities of hacking.
As a first step, we provided 20 young participants
with smartphones, a six-month data plan and created
an app called the MobileMiner. The app was designed
to learn about the data being generated by both the
devices and applications that our participants were
using. While we were aware that most of our participants
4 Big Data & Society
were also using their pre-existing mobiles, we hoped that
the free data plan we provided would entice them to use
our phones. Ultimately, given the exploratory nature of
our project, we were more focused on the quality, as
opposed to the quantity, of what could be gathered
and analysed. That being said, to account for this dis-
crepancy of mobile use, we asked our participants to
keep tumblr media diaries to investigate the apps they
were regularly using (regardless of the device) and to
ascertain their perception of the amount of time they
thought they were spending on their devices. In addition,
we held two hackathons; the first explored ways of
improving the MobileMiner app, and the second allowed
our participants to work with the data that our applica-
tion had collected from their devices.
In addition, we divided all our research participants
into groups and held three, two hour focus groups at the
beginning of the project. The aim of these sessions was
to a) establish relations of trust and b) gain a broad sense
of how our participants view, understand and negotiate
their privacy online. Additionally, we conducted inter-
views during and after the second hackathon to observe
the individual's reaction once presented with their per-
sonal data cache amassed by the MobileMiner app and
then later to gain a clearer understanding of the proto-
types they constructed.
MobileMiner: Collective construction
of research devices
There were two primary deliverables from our co-
research: a data-gathering app and the data itself. The
MobileMiner application we created was initially
downloaded onto the Android smartphones we gave
to our participants. It was designed to gather the data
which is most typically harvested by apps. The applica-
tion was always conceptualized as a data-making tool
that could eventually be used outside of our research
project and can be found on GitHub for free download.
To ward off `creepy' surveillance and enable greater
privacy for our co-researchers, they had the autonomy
to turn on and off the app as they wished and thus were
never forced to have their data mined.
We envisioned our application as a specific contri-
bution to the growing number of open source tools that
are making visible the dynamic ways in which a user's
cultural practices and sociality become datafied. It's
function was to collect in- and outgoing communica-
tions from the smartphones, including information on
the total amount of data sent and app network activity,
alongside location information and identifiers. We
wanted the application to function as a kind data spy,
thereby examining the frequency at which apps rou-
tinely harvest data. The approach we undertook is
used by commercial providers and has the advantage
that it does not require permissions granted by the user
when the app is installed. We decided early to not be
too aggressive about tracking the app behaviour and
excluded, for instance, direct access to GPS informa-
tion on the phone. Instead, we used opencellid.org to
link our app to the cell tower location database.
Building trust with our co-researchers factored more
strongly into our research design then maximising the
harvesting capacity of the MobileMiner. Furthermore,
in contrast to surveillant-modes of maximum data
scooping, we wanted to find out what non-aggressive
modalities of datafication could yield.
The second research deliverable co-developed with
the YRSers was the actual data that was collected via
the MobileMiner app. We envisioned this as part of
what a big social data commons could look like, insofar
as it was anonymised but open to exploration and cre-
ative use by our co-researchers. Data harvested from our
mobile devices almost invariably ends up in proprietary
datasets over which we have no access. In contrast, we
wanted to explore an alternative infrastructure. To do
so, we used a Comprehensive Knowledge Archive
Network (CKAN) platform, an open source repository
developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation, as the
core element of an open data ecosystem.
The CKAN instance was updated at regular intervals
from a local database on the mobile phone via the
MobileMiner app. Finally, we took the innovative
approach of packaging the CKAN data together with
a standard toolbox so that this prototype of a big social
data commons could be worked over in a virtual
machine that is free to download from our website.
Once both the MobileMiner and CKAN were in place,
we started a controlled experiment to receive data from
our participants over a six-month period. We returned
this to our co-researchers during the second hackathon
for creative inquiry.
Focus groups: From individual agency
and control to group privacy
The focus groups revealed that most of our co-research-
ers are deeply aware of the compromises involved when
it comes to managing their digital privacy. All of the
teenagers we spoke with know that their data is being
routinely mined. At issue, however, is not the know-
ledge of data extraction but rather what happens to
this information once it moves beyond their reach.
Reactions among our participants were varied. Kylie,
for example, spoke out at length about her frustrations
around the monetization of data:
The problem with this generation is that we are far
more scared of the individual, you know the pedophiles
and the online bullies rather than corporations. What
Pybus et al. 5
we are not taught about is that fact we shouldn't be
allowing big corporations like Google and Facebook to
have access to our personal details.
In fact, she was so bothered by the privatization of data
that she and her friends had refused having a
Facebook, Instagram or Twitter account. Conversely,
most of the other participants showed far less concern.
Jacob put his thoughts the most succinctly: ``Perhaps
the most surprising thing is just how little we care about
that!'' (in relation to the growing number of third-parties
mining personal data), followed by a very animated
discussion whereby others in the group confirmed and
reiterated his opinion.
Jacob's comments, however, need to be taken into
context. As one of the stronger coders in the room, he
also expressed how important it was to have control over
the technologies he was using; a sentiment that was
taken up by almost everyone we spoke to. According
to Anna (which garnered a number of nods in focus
group A):
Being of this generation and being tech savvy we have
some control because we know how to have control,
whereas I know that my Mum doesn't have any
idea. . .We know we can control our privacy and a lot
of people do but then a lot of people also go and they
are just using the technology but don't actually under-
stand how it works.
Control, within this context, links directly with Anna's
sense of agency that is bolstered by her intimate know-
ledge of how to use and manipulate the technologies
that she is engaged with. Overall, we would summarise
our findings on agency and control over privacy as fol-
lows: i) a desire for control over messages being sent
about oneself; ii) control over a message in relation to
peer groups ­thus it mattered more if a close friend
uncovered a bad photograph posted on Instagram
then a complete stranger; and, iii) a desire for better
understanding of the technological affordances of a
medium.
We observed the relationship between the desire for
agency and control and technological literacies playing
out in a number of different ways for our participants.
For example, several of our co-researchers actively
obfuscated the data being captured about themselves,
most notably through the routine removal of Google's
geolocation data from their mobile browsers. The tac-
tics used to protect their privacy ­ `unmaking data' ­
ranged from deleting metadata that reveal geolocation
in photographs, deleting accounts, withholding per-
sonal information such as addresses, setting up proxies
(one participant claimed he had set up seven proxies on
his mobile phone) and using alternative open sourced
platforms that run on Linux. What these strategies
unambiguously revealed for this group of young
people is the inherent confidence that comes out of
their various technological literacies.
Maintaining digital privacy might be somewhat
easier for our participants, but if their peer groups
want to use a leaky app, we discovered that most of
our participants will use it too. Phoebe laughed, recall-
ing when she had tried to get her friends to take up an
open source alternative to Skype. She quickly
abandoned these efforts because her friends found this
platform too difficult and cumbersome to use. Despite
how effective this other platform was at preventing
data from being tracked, she went back to Skype. She
went on to recall why she never stayed on `Diaspora', an
open-source, decentralized social network that has tried
to provide users with control over their data. When her
friends again refused to migrate, she remained on
Facebook. So while she would have preferred to use
this alternative network, she elected to remain where
her friends were. For her, privacy is arguable not inher-
ently individual, but, rather, far more collectively under-
stood. A similar sentiment was expressed by David
when he was talking about using the privacy settings
on Facebook: ``it's kind of herd thing, you've all got
to do it otherwise, one person is in trouble.'' Again,
privacy is not simply about him but about collective
choices that are made by his peer group.
Often, when it comes to online privacy, the focus has
remained on what the individual does or should do,
such as in Livingstone's study on teenagers in the age
of social networking (2008) that assesses privacy
through the lense of risk assessment. Later, she expands
this work with another study performed with
Livingstone et al. (2014), wherein their findings focus
on the identity management techniques of EU children.
Conversely, Boyd and Marwick's (2011) work on priv-
acy explores the various strategies that young people
have invoked to maintain control within a networked
environment. Their findings suggest that on-line priv-
acy does matter significantly and is observed through
the paucity of ways in which their participants had
learned to conceal information from undesirable inter-
locutors while remaining visible to their peer groups.
What Boyd and Marwick do not explicitly mention,
but what our research suggests, is that there are also
inherent group dynamics making it possible for these
young people to hide in the open and maintain some
degree of control over the content they have chosen to
circulate within the wider domain. Seeing the dynamics
of privacy as being rooted in a collective, based on the
cultural norms that have been established by a peer
group, is an interesting finding with practical and the-
oretical implications, particularly when it comes to
pedagogical approaches to data literacy.

Hackathons: Making tools
Our hackathons draw on the digital humanities trad-
ition of `critical making' as complementary to `critical
thinking'; that is, as a material form of critique which is
both `external' and `community-oriented' (Svensson,
2012: 53). While it is beyond the scope of this paper
to discuss all of the tools and prototypes that were
created during our second hackathon, it is instructive
to offer a brief overview of what some of our coders
were able to produce when given access to their data on
the CKAN instance. The challenge with our methodo-
logical approach lies in its demand for specific techno-
logical competencies to manipulate the data that we
were able to provide. Indeed, how can a user participate
in building an open and transparent digital commons if
they cannot confidently engage with platforms at the
level of code, algorithms and databases? There is no
comprehensive or immediate way to meet this chal-
lenge. Nonetheless, we anticipated that there was
much to learn from the technologically savvy young
people we worked with.
Here we can present some relevant examples. Phoebe
created what she referred to as `sous-sousveillance' of
the apps she was using. This approach was inspired by
the initial observations that revealed how some of the
applications being used by our participants were
extracting significantly more data than others. For
example, the MobileMiner registered that three of our
YRSers (Kylie, Edward and Julian) were playing a
game entitled: `Don't Tap the White Tile,' which was
accessing the Internet on 46, 53 and 42 occasions over
periods of 21, two and three days, respectively.
According to our analysis, the frequency at which
data was exchanged between this app and the server
is supported by commercial studies, which report that
up to 95% of mobile apps see similar patterns of use
(Boris, 2013). However, these data patterns are in stark
contrast to Kylie's interaction with another game: `The
Line-Keep In,' a simple app involving the navigation of
a dot through a vertically scrolling maze.
On closer inspection of the code, the game uses vari-
ous tools to gather deep statistics and push user mes-
sages. Permission to access player GPS location is
requested, even though the Mobile Country Code of
any device's last connected cell tower would be suffi-
cient to localize advertisements to the player's country.
Despite the game's simplicity, her device called home
1760 times over a period of 27 days, with significant
activity registered every day (Blanke et al., 2014).
This number is notably higher than the other applica-
tion we observed and raises questions in relation to
the structural differences between the apps users regu-
larly download.
Equipped with the data from MobileMiner, Phoebe
wanted to consider what constituted a leaky app.
She therefore tried to create an application that could
sonify what she called the ``attention grabbing-ness of
apps . . . so you could tell immediately which were worse
for calling home.'' To clarify, the term calling home
refers to when an application accesses its server on
the Internet, presumably to relay personal and or
GPS data accumulated from the user's smartphone
and/or other applications. The MobileMiner app was
designed to track the frequency by which data moves
between the user and any given downloaded app. Our
challenge, however, arose in determining what, specif-
ically, passes between the mobile and the app's server.
Nevertheless, the data that we did procure was enough
to facilitate Phoebe's hack on the ``noisiness of apps.''
Ultimately, she wanted to create an application that
could listen to the data as it moves from an individual
phone to a server. She therefore assigned tones and col-
ours to correlate with the frequency of data requests that
are routinely made by apps. Had she completed this
hack, her app would have generated brighter and more
grating sounds to coincide with the leakier and more
invasive apps found more broadly on a user's device.
When asked why she wanted to turn the data into
sounds and colours, Phoebe told us that these kinds of
visualizations were in many respects more accurate:
Most people would prefer this to numbers on a screen
or paper, as it's a lot more jarring for the non-savvy, as
some could say that higher, louder tones are uncom-
fortable, whereas seeing numbers is relatively meaning-
less unless you know the context . . . This could break
down the complicatedness for the end user . . . It would
be great if you could listen to a list of apps, to find the
tones, to find the ones that are potential problems.
The tool she set out to create was meant to easily draw
a user's attention towards the leakiness of different
apps, regardless of their technological expertise. This
is but a small example of the kinds of creative and
critical possibilities that might emerge when users
have access to their data, in this case via a CKAN
instance. Subsequently, Phoebe's hack reflects both
her strong political engagement and a desire to create
tools that might engage others:
Far too many people don't understand quite how much
they are giving to companies and how much this data is
worth to them especially when the privacy policies are
shady at best. And when you can't have members of the
public check what the Facebooks and Googles are
doing inside of these apps and with the data behind
closed doors then it becomes very easy for them to
exploit the user. After all, data is the new currency
and with the amounts these companies have they
could buy anyone.
Pybus et al. 7
Agency, here, lies in having more transparency in the
ability to work on, process and transform the materiality
of datafication, elements which typically move outside
the user's knowledge or control. The sonification tool
represents a creative possibility in a data literacy toolkit,
fostering resistance by illuminating those covert `sous-sur-
veillance', data mining practices that sustain new economic
and algorithmic relations. Tom's hack also examined the
value of collective surveillance/sous-surveillance prac-
tices. However, his interest lay in the frequency of app
activity, and whether there was a correlation between
app usage and the amount of information being relayed
to a server.
Tom used the CKAN instance data to develop a
graph generating tool to demonstrate when and for
how long our participants were using the Twitter,
Facebook and Facebook Messenger app. More specif-
ically, he wanted to know what days of the week these
apps were being used, alongside the frequency and
times in which they were accessed. He then cross refer-
enced these with the number of notifications that the
apps sent back to their home servers. By so doing, he
asked three questions of the data: 1) Does using an
application result in an increased number of notifica-
tions? 2) Is there a day of the week that appears to
make the user more vulnerable to the app leaking? 3)
Is there a time a day that makes the user more vulner-
able to the app leaking? His end point was to visualize
and see how this might change over time.
While Tom was less concerned about the appropri-
ation of his data for commercial use in the focus group,
it remained important to quantify and qualify his social
media usage, again echoing those discourses discussed
earlier around control. Yet, instead of tracking the
material body's movement through space and time,
Tom wanted to grasp his movements within those digit-
ally networked social media environments. He imagines:
Maybe in the future this could work on a daily basis
over months and years rather than just a week. We
could see how social media is used more on important
days such as during big events. For others it could also
be used for statistical analysis along with other social
media datasets to create a wider picture of what we do
online.
Similar to Phoebe, Tom wants to have access and con-
trol over his data to better understand his data profile.
However, this is not simply about having more open
data3 but instead, to develop more nuanced ways of
understanding his own personal data production in
relation to his peers. Here he states:
While I agree with open datasets, I don't think that
data should be taken without permission ­ people
should have control over their data, anonymous or
not, and if anything is to be done with it it should be
open to all rather than kept by companies.
When we think about how data literacy might be devel-
oped through further research, we are drawn to the
empowerment that comes from gaining access to what
we collectively generate. For these coders, agency began
with their ability to manipulate and make something
from the entire set of data that the MobileMiner app
gathered from all of our participants' smartphones in
the CKAN instance.
Conclusion
Throughout the project, the active participation of the
YRSers has always been paramount. Echoing Kelty
(2008), we tried to facilitate the development of a recur-
sive data public by practically modifying the material
infrastructure of datafication to critically engage
power­knowledge relations. Our research shows that
there is tremendous untapped potential in the general
intellect and technical practice, not just among our teen
coders but in the figure of the data generator who wants
to be in control and, more importantly, seeks to under-
stand the data they collectively generate.
For us, a recursive data public is one with aug-
mented critical data making capacity. We therefore
see our contribution in two ways: The first lies in creat-
ing open social and cultural data sets that are accessible
for critical and creative use by both researchers and the
general public ­ an area of research that we are cur-
rently pursuing, as are others. Some, for example, are
exploring the potential of blockchain technology, the
`distributed ledger' underpinning BitCoin that may
facilitate new forms of digital commons (see Bollier,
2015; O'Dwyer, 2015). Others, such as Salvatore
Iaconesi and Oriana Persico, are building a ubiquitous
commons;4 that is, a space calibrated by new techno-
logical, legal and social protocols which assure greater
user control ­ a sentiment that strongly resonates with
our empirical research.
Our second contribution is to further develop non-
prescriptive modes of interdisciplinary research, includ-
ing but not limited to hackathons and workshops. Our
project demonstrated the enriching and critical value
forthcoming from working with and learning from
young coders. More research is required to explore a
collective understanding of digital privacy, in addition
to innovative digital methods that can further unpack
the mobile ecosystem. The realm of datafication is
opaque; metaphorically we would like to imagine
attaching radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags
to granular data points and tracking their flow through
the social life of data which drives predictive analytics,
8 Big Data & Society
circuits of consumption, business intelligence and state
surveillance. More collective interdisciplinary methods
that engage our contemporary technological condition
beyond the enclosures of platforms, apps and user inter-
faces are required. Moving forward, if we want to
develop new tools and methods to enhance the active
participation of users, then we must carefully consider
how we can both make and unmake data. The sous-
surveillance and social media quantification tools are
but two examples meant to highlight the possibilities
that can exist if users have access to their own data.

Notes
1. The term is used loosely here, as more often blocking
third-parties or cookies ultimately means that the user
will then not have access to the website.
2. Media literacy here refers to a large body of work in
Cultural and Media Studies that has been aimed at build-
ing various tools to empower individuals to think critically
about how meaning gets sedimented and in turn how the
world around them is constructed. The end point is to
empower individual subjects to understand this process
so that they can shape their own identity and, as Kellner
and Share argue, ``transform the material and social con-
ditions of their culture and society'' (2005: 369).
