Racial Differences in Awareness of the
Affordable Care Act and Application
Assistance Among Low-Income
Adults in Three Southern States

Abstract
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility to adults with incomes under 138% of the federal poverty
level, leading to substantial reductions in uninsured rates among low-income adults. Despite large gains in coverage, studies
suggest that Latinos may be less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to apply and enroll in health insurance, and they remain
the group with the highest uninsured rate in the United States. We explore two potential factors related to racial/ethnic
differences in ACA enrollment--awareness of the law and receipt of application assistance such as navigator services. Using
a survey of nearly 3000 low-income U.S. citizens (aged 19-64) in 3 states in late 2014, we find that Latinos had significantly
lower levels of awareness of the ACA relative to other groups, even after adjusting for demographic covariates. Higher
education was the strongest positive predictor of ACA awareness. In contrast, Latinos were much more likely to receive
assistance from navigators or social workers when applying, relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Taken together, these
results highlight the importance of ACA outreach efforts to increase awareness among low-income and less educated
populations, two groups that are overrepresented in the Latino population, to close existing disparities in coverage.

Introduction
Starting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded
Medicaid eligibility to adults in participating states with
incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL).
Level of awareness of the ACA is a key predictor of whether
people apply for coverage.1 Despite significant outreach
efforts, overall knowledge about the law remains poor
among low-income and uninsured adults.2 Working with a
navigator or receiving other application assistance has been
shown to be a major factor in improving enrollment rates.1
Meanwhile, several studies have reported that Latinos may
be less likely to apply and enroll in health insurance under
the ACA, even though they remain the highest risk group to
be uninsured in the United States.3,4 Possible explanations
include lower levels of health insurance literacy, language
barriers, and immigration status.5 Our objective was to
explore whether ACA awareness and receipt of application
assistance differed across racial and ethnic groups among
low-income U.S. citizens in 3 Southern states with high
pre-ACA uninsured rates.
Methods
Our data come from a telephone survey of US citizens
aged 19 to 64 with household incomes less than 138%
of FPL in Texas, Arkansas, and Kentucky. The survey was
conducted in November and December 2014 on mobile
and landline phones, and was available in English and
Spanish. Survey estimates were weighted to Census demo-
graphic benchmarks for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,
marital status, population density, and cell phone status;
details of the survey have been published previously.6
The interview focused on respondents' awareness of and
experiences with the ACA.

2 INQUIRY
We used a multivariate logistic regression model to identify
predictors of having heard "a lot" or "some" regarding the
ACA(compared with "little" or "none"), and, among applicants,
whether they received assistance from "navigators or social
workers," a phrase meant to encompass a range of application
assisters, including certified application counselors and navi-
gators, who are state-trained individuals tasked with providing
application assistance and educational outreach. The key vari-
able of interest was race/ethnicity, in the following mutually
exclusive categories: Latino, white non-Latino, black non-
Latino, and Other (which included those reporting more than
one race or providing no response). We estimated differences
by race/ethnicity after controlling for state, age, sex, educa-
tion, income, rural versus urban residence, and whether the
survey was completed in Spanish. We reported odds ratios and
predicted probabilities associated with each covariate.
Results
Table 1 presents racial/ethnic differences in ACA awareness
and use of application assistance. In the unadjusted model
(n = 2794), Latinos had significantly lower awareness of the
ACA than whites (P = .007), and this difference remained
highly significant even after adjustment. Overall, Latinos
had the lowest level of awareness of the racial/ethnic groups
in our sample, with only 38.5% having heard or read "some"
or "a lot" about the ACA, compared with 48% for whites and
46% for blacks, and 50.1% for Other. The fully adjusted
model demonstrated that education was a much stronger
predictor ofACAawareness than race/ethnicity. Respondents
who attended or graduated college had nearly a 20 percentage
point higher ACA awareness than respondents without high
school degrees.
Table 1 also presents findings on the use of application
assistance among applicants for Medicaid or Marketplace
coverage (n = 1107). The unadjusted model showed no
significant differences in rates of application assistance by
race/ethnicity, but after adjustment, receipt of assistance was
13 percentage points higher among Latinos than whites
(P = .09). Kentucky and Arkansas respondents received
assistance at higher rates (48.0% and 37.3%, respectively)
than respondents in Texas (28.7%).

Note. Total sample size = 2801. Analysis of ACA awareness excluded 7 individuals who chose not to answer that item (n = 2794). Only respondents who said they had applied
for Medicaid or marketplace coverage were asked whether they received application assistance (n = 1107). Unadjusted models controlled for race/ethnicity. Full models added
state of residence, age, gender, Spanish language survey, rural versus urban residence, education level, and income as covariates. We calculated predicted probabilities from the
logistic regression estimates using Stata's "margins" command with default settings, which holds all covariates at their actual values. ACA = Affordable Care Act; OR = odds
ratios from multivariate logistical regression; Pred. prob. = predicted probability; FPL = federal poverty level.

Given that language and ethnicity are highly correlated,
we tested the effect of excluding Spanish language as a
covariate. The results for Latino ethnicity were similar
(awareness odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, P = .07; application
assistance OR = 1.81, P = .05) to those in our full model.
Discussion
In our survey of low-income US citizens in 3 states, we found
that Latinos have significantly lower ACA awareness even
after adjusting for income and education. ACA awareness
is the critical first step in improving uninsured rates among
vulnerable populations, and our findings suggest that lack of
information is a key barrier among Latinos.7 Somewhat sur-
prisingly, language did not contribute to these informational
barriers in our study, as completing the survey in Spanish
was not a significant predictor of awareness. Education and
race/ethnicity were more important factors, suggesting the
need for targeted approaches that can reach individuals who
may have low levels of experience with the health care system.
Our findings also suggest that application assistance can
play an important role in reducing racial/ethnic gaps in enroll-
ment rates.These results are consistent with previous research,
especially in the case of Latinos, who are the least likely to
apply for coverage, but simultaneously use assistance most
heavily.3,8 Not surprisingly, Kentucky residents were more
likely to receive application assistance, given the state's
aggressive outreach efforts.9 However, navigators can only be
effective after applicants seek assistance, and thus must
already be at least somewhat knowledgeable about the ACA.
Our study has several limitations. We can only present cor-
relations between our covariates and outcome variables, as
opposed to causal relationships. Furthermore, our sample's
racial composition differs significantly between states: More
than 80% of the Latinos in our sample live in Texas, whereas
other racial and ethnic groups were more evenly distributed,
though we adjusted directly for state of residence in our analy-
sis. Our study also focused exclusively on those reporting US
citizenship and did not ask about the legal status of other
household members. This means our results are not due to dif-
ferences in eligibility for public coverage due to immigration
status among survey respondents. However, having family
members with undocumented status can reduce coverage rates
among legal immigrants and US citizens, and our data set
did not allow us to explore this important issue. Finally, our
response rate of 26% may be subject to non-response bias,
though we weighted to appropriate population benchmarks,
which research shows can mitigate this potential bias.10
In conclusion, despite abundant research pointing to
large drops in uninsured rates associated with the ACA and
Medicaid expansion,2,11-13 disparities remain for Latinos.
Our results highlight the need to target outreach efforts to
low-income adults with less education--a group with a
disproportionately high number of Latinos--to close gaps
inACAawareness and, ultimately, health insurance coverage
rates.
