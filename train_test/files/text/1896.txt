Overweight and obese hypertensive patients can greatly
benefit from high adherence rates for lifestyle modifica-
tions. The objectives of this paper were to investigate
how patients' weight status affected physicians' recom-
mendations of lifestyle modifications and patients'
adherence after they received the recommendations.
The patients were adults (18 þ years of age) with
hypertension (prehypertension, Stage I and Stage II
hypertension). The National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2000 was used. Weight
status was categorized as normal/underweight, over-
weight and obese. Physicians' recommendations of and
patients' adherence to lifestyle modifications (weight
control, exercise, sodium intake reduction, alcohol
intake reduction) were examined using descriptive and
multivariate analyses, controlling for weight status,
hypertension stage, comorbidities and demographic
characteristics. About 57.0% of the US adult population
in 1999­2000 had prehypertension, Stages I or II
hypertension. Among the hypertensive adults, 30.3%
were normal/underweight, 32.6% were overweight and
37.2% were obese. We found that physicians were more
aggressive in recommending lifestyle modification for
obese patients. In contrast, obese hypertensive patients
were not found to be more likely than normal/under-
weight patients to adhere to lifestyle modification
recommendations. In addition, adherence rates for
sodium and alcohol consumption reduction were higher
than that for either exercise or weight control. In
conclusion, more aggressive approaches should be
taken by physicians to educate obese patients about
the benefits of lifestyle modifications and to improve
adherence to enhance the effects of antihypertensive
medications.

Introduction
The JNC 7 and JNC 6 reports repeatedly stress the
beneficial effects of nonpharmacological interven-
tions for hypertension.1,2 As compared to the
adherence to pharmacological treatments, the ad-
herence to nonpharmacological treatments is lower
among hypertensive patients.3­5 Although it is
recommended that physicians provide advice and
consultations regarding lifestyle modifications as
part of hypertension management, as suggested by
the JNC reports, low-to-moderate adherence is
observed in hypertensive patients.6,7
It was shown that the blood pressure (BP) levels of
patients influenced physicians' prescriptions of life-
style modifications.6 It is unknown, however, whether
a patient's weight status is incorporated in his or her
physician's decision of recommending lifestyle modi-
fications. In addition, despite the known benefits of
weight control/loss in BP control and management of
other chronic conditions and diseases, it is unclear
how weight status of a patient influences adherence.
Certain patient characteristics, such as age,8,9 pre-
sence of chronic conditions, education,9 ethnicity,
and income level10 were found to be associated with
adherence to lifestyle modifications. However,
whether weight status of a patient was a factor
predictive of adherence is not fully understood.
Although one tends to believe that overweight and
obese patients would be more likely to be active
in improving health, seeking medical care, and
adhering to treatment regimens, it was shown
that overweight men reported deficits in care as

compared with average weight men.11 Also, a higher
body mass index (BMI) increased the likelihood
of delay and avoidance of care.12 In seeking prev-
ention, morbidly obese women were less likely
than normal weight women to undergo cancer
screenings.13 Among hypertension patients, results
from cluster analyses indicated that obesity and
nonadherence to medications were clustered with
nonadherence to lifestyle modifications.14 Unfortu-
nately, no previous studies of chronic disease
management investigated the independent effect of
patients' weight status on adherence to lifestyle
modifications.
The objective of this study was to investigate how
weight status affected physicians' recommendations
of lifestyle modifications to hypertensive patients and
patients' adherence after they received the recom-
mendations. The following hypotheses were tested:
1. Overweight and obese hypertensive patients are
more likely than normal weight patients to
receive recommendations of lifestyle modifica-
tions, given the hypertension stages and comor-
bidities; and
2. Adherence rates for lifestyle modifications are
higher among overweight and obese patients.
Methods
Data
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999­2000 was used.15 This
survey was part of the NHANES series starting in
the 1960s. The NHANES data were collected by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The NHANES survey design was a stratified, multi-
stage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutio-
nalized US population. NHANES 1999­2000
oversampled low-income persons, adolescents 12­19
years, persons 60 years of age or older, African
Americans and Mexican Americans. In addition to
interviews, health examinations were conducted
through mobile examination centres, which had on
staff one physician, one dentist, two dietary inter-
viewers, three certified medical technologists, five
health technicians, one phlebotomist, two inter-
viewers and one computer data manager. Home
examinations were given to subjects who were unable
or unwilling to visit the mobile examination centres.
Laboratory results were obtained from analyses of
blood, urine, hair, air, tuberculosis skin test, and
household dust specimens collected at the mobile
examination centres or in the home. There were 9965
subjects in the NHANES 1999­2000 data set.
Hypertension and weight status
For the purpose of the current study, an adult
subject (18 þ years) was included in the sample if
(1) his or her systolic blood pressure (SBP) from
the examination was 120 mmHg or higher or
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 80 mmHg or
higher, or (2) he or she was taking antihypertensive
medications. Three or four BP determinations were
taken for each subject in the mobile examination
centre or home following standardized protocols.
The average readings of the SBP and DBP were used
in the current study to determine a subject's
hypertension stage. Subjects who satisfied the
inclusion criteria were grouped into prehyper-
tension (SBP 120­139 or DBP 80­89 mmHg),
Stage I (SBP 140­159 or DBP 90­99 mmHg)
and Stage II (SBPX160 or DBPX100 mmHg).2 In
the following text, the definition of hypertension
includes prehypertension.
A hypertensive patient's BP may be under control
if he or she is taking medications. To incorporate the
effects of antihypertensive medications, the final
categorization of hypertension status was the inter-
action of hypertension stage (prehypertension,
Stages I and II) and whether a patient took
antihypertensives (see the header column of
Table 1). It should be noted that it is possible for
patients who took antihypertensives to have normal
BP. Normal BP with antihypertensives was added as
an additional category.
Subjects' weight status was determined by their
BMI. Body measurements were obtained in the
mobile examination centres following the Anthro-
pometric Standardization Reference manual.16
Using the classification by CDC, subjects were
grouped into underweight (BMIo18.5 kg/m2), nor-
mal (18.5pBMIo25.0 kg/m2), overweight
(25.0pBMIo30.0 kg/m2) and obese (BMIX30.0 kg/
m2).17 Because the underweight group had too small
a sample size to provide accurate estimates, the
current study combined the first two groups as the
normal/underweight category.
Physicians' recommendations and patients' adherence
In NHANES, subjects were asked `Have you ever
been told by a doctor or other health professional
that you had hypertension, also called high blood
pressure?' If the answer was `Yes', then they were
further asked whether physicians had recom-
mended lifestyle modifications (LMs). LMs in-
cluded weight control, reduction of sodium intake,
more exercise and reduction of alcohol intake.
Patients' adherence to the recommended LMs
were obtained from subjects who received recom-
mendations of LMs from physicians. They were
asked (for hypertension) `Are you now controlling
your weight or losing weight', `Are you now cutting
down on salt or sodium in your diet', `Are you now
exercising more', and `Are you now cutting down on
your alcohol consumption,' respectively. Conse-
quently, adherence was defined as responses of
`yes' to these questions.

Control variables
In addition to weight status and hypertension stage,
other factors (eg, comorbidities) may have affected
physicians' recommendations of LMs. Several con-
trol variables in addition to weight status and
hypertension status were included in the analyses
of the recommendations of LMs. Included self-
reported comorbidities were dyslipidaemia, heart
diseases, diabetes mellitus, and kidney diseases.
Furthermore, patients' age and gender were
controlled for. In addition, it has been shown that
in predicting adherence, race/ethnicity, educational
achievement and income level were significant.18­20
In analysing adherence, race/ethnicity, education
and income level were also included as control
variables.
Statistical analyses
To address how weight status affected physicians'
recommendations of LMs, multivariate logistic
regressions were used to determine whether physi-
cians took into consideration a patient's weight
status in recommending each of the four LMs,
controlling for hypertension stage, comorbidities,
age and gender of the subject. As discussed earlier,
because only patients who were aware of their
hypertension responded to the questions of recom-
mendations of LMs, only a subsample of patients
(n ¼ 1368) were included in the multivariate
analyses. The comparisons between patients
who were and were not aware of their hypertension
were made.
To examine whether weight status was associated
with adherence to each LM, a second set of multi-
variate logistic regressions were performed, control-
ling for hypertension stage, comorbidities, age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education and income. The
adherence analyses were performed among only
patients whose physicians recommended LMs,
because adherence could not be defined if patients
did not receive recommendations from physicians.
The complex sampling design, primary sampling
units, strata and person weight in NHANES were
incorporated in all analyses to provide natio-
nally representative estimates for the adult hyper-
tensive subpopulation. Statistical software STATAs
(College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform all
analyses.
Results
Among 9965 subjects, 3061 satisfied the criteria
of hypertension (including prehypertension),
representing 57.0% of the US adult population in
1999­2000. For the hypertensive adult population,
about 53.9% were prehypertensive and were not
taking antihypertensive medications and about
19.5% were Stages I and II hypertension but not
taking antihypertensives. About 4.1 and 10.3% were
patients who were taking antihypertensives and had
normal BP and prehypertension, respectively. Ap-
proximately 12.4% were taking antihypertensives
and had Stages I and II hypertension. Among the
hypertensive adults, 30.3% were normal/under-
weight, 32.6% were overweight and 37.2% were
obese. The crosstabulation of hypertension stage
and weight status of the hypertensive adult popula-
tion is shown in Table 1. The general observation
was that as compared with normal/underweight
patients, overweight and obese patients were more
likely to be on antihypertensive medications and
more likely to have Stages I and II hypertension.
Table 2 reports the composition of the full
hypertensive adult sample and the sample of those
who were aware of their hypertension to be used in
the multivariate analyses. As compared with the full
sample, patients who were aware of their hyperten-
sion were more likely to be overweight or obese,

more likely to have chronic comorbidities and older.
All subjects who were not aware of their hyperten-
sion were not on antihypertensives (n ¼ 1693) and
70.9% of them had prehypertension.
Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics and
multivariate analyses of physicians' recommenda-
tions of LMs. Over half of the subjects aware of their
hypertension were told by their physicians to
control weight. About two-thirds were told to
reduce sodium consumption and to exercise more.
Approximately 28.1% were told to reduce alcohol
consumption. As compared to normal/underweight
subjects, obese subjects were 9.0 times (Po0.01) as
likely to receive advice on weight control, 1.7 times
(P ¼ 0.04) as likely to be told by physicians to reduce
sodium intake, and more than three times (Po0.01)
as likely to be advised to increase exercise levels.
The odds of receiving advice on weight control was
2.1 (P ¼ 0.02) among overweight individuals as
compared to normal/underweight subjects. Weight
status was not found to be associated with recom-
mendations of alcohol intake reduction.
Overall, patients on antihypertensives were sig-
nificantly more likely than those who were not on
antihypertensives to receive all four recommenda-
tions from their physicians. Hypertension stage
among patients who were not on antihypertensives
did not seem to affect the probabilities of receiving
the LM recommendations from their physicians.
On the patients' side, a different pattern emerged
in regard to the effect of weight status on the
adherence to LMs (Table 4). Among the four LMs,
the adherence rate for sodium reduction was the
highest, 86.0%, whereas that for more exercise was
the lowest, 60.1%. Neither weight status nor
hypertension status significantly influenced the
adherence. That is, overweight/obese patients were
not more likely to adhere to LM recommendations.
Although not shown in Table 4, a few demo-
graphic and health characteristics were found to be
associated with adherence. Controlling for weight
status and hypertension stage, females were found
to be more likely than males to adhere to sodium
reduction (OR ¼ 2.46, P ¼ 0.003). Hispanic subjects
were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to
adhere to recommendations of exercise (OR ¼ 2.61,
P ¼ 0.025). Subjects with heart diseases were more
likely than those without heart diseases to adhere to
recommendations of weight control (OR ¼ 2.42,
P ¼ 0.013). Patients with dyslipidaemia were less
likely to reduce sodium intake (OR ¼ 0.69,
P ¼ 0.031). Diabetic patients were more likely to
exercise more (OR ¼ 7.21, Po0.001).
Discussion
This study examined the effects of weight status on
whether adult hypertensive patients received re-
commendations of lifestyle modifications from their
physicians and on their adherence. Because over-
weight and obese patients are at higher risks for
elevated BP, we would expect physicians to be more
likely to recommend LMs to overweight and obese
patients than to normal weight patients, given the
same hypertension stage. For the same reason, we
would expect overweight and obese patients to be
more likely than their normal weight counterparts to
adhere to the LM regimens to control BP. Our results
indicated that physicians indeed were more aggres-
sive in recommending LMs for obese patients. In
contrast, obese hypertensive patients were not

found to be more likely to adhere to LM recommen-
dations. Summary of the new findings from the
current study is shown in Table 5.
On the patients' side, the current study showed
that adherence to sodium and alcohol consumption
reduction were greater than that to either exercise or
weight control. One possible explanation for the
divergence in the adherence rates is that sodium and
alcohol consumption reduction require less time
and effort than weight control and exercise. The
argument of `ease of execution' has multiple facets
in addition to time consumption: the cost, complex-
ity of regimen, behavioural incentives and specifi-
city. Several previous studies have shed some light
on these regards. One study noted that cost and
transportation contributed to nonadherence to
weight control and exercise.21 In addition, patients'
health beliefs may have played an important role.
For example, one study demonstrated that greater
perceived seriousness of diabetes was associated
with greater reduction in BMI at 1 year.22 Also, a
simple recommendation of exercise may not be
sufficient to induce behavioural changes because
exercise or weight control may be too broad or
ambiguous a concept for patients to follow. For
instance, in examining exercise in multiple short
bouts vs one continuous bout in a randomized trial,
researchers found that adherence was significantly
greater among subjects who exercised in multiple
short bouts per day.23
One possible explanation for the nonsignificant
effect of weight status in predicting adherence is
that the actual weight status derived from BMI is not
a good measure in explaining adherence behaviours.
It may be that how a patient perceives his or her
weight status rather than the objective BMI deter-
mines adherence behaviour. We performed the same
analyses shown in Table 4, substituting perceived
weight status for the objectively measured BMI. The
subjects were asked `Do you consider yourself now
to be overweight, underweight, or about the right
weight?' Similar results were obtained using the two
different measurements of weight status.
The estimated prevalence rate (including pre-
hypertension) was 57.0% among US adults. In
contrast, a previous study using the same data
calculated a prevalence rate of 28.7%, in which
only Stages I and II hypertension were included.24
Also, because the LM recommendation and adher-
ence data were only available among patients who
were aware of their hypertension, we were unable to
identify the patterns among subjects who were not
aware of their hypertension. As Table 2 shows, the
vast majority of the subjects who were unaware of
their hypertension had prehypertension and were
not using antihypertensives. Consequently, the
results from our multivariate analyses were probably
more applicable to patients who were on antihyper-
tensives and those with Stages I and II hypertension.
It should be noted that due to the retrospective
nature of the study, we were unable to include some
factors that may affect adherence, for example, the
type of exercise recommended by physicians, the
level of alcohol consumption regarded as desirable
and whether the subject consulted with a dietitian.
Furthermore, self-reported adherence measures
were used. Consequently, the measures were subject
to possible recall failure and biases associated with
certain patient characteristics. Also, for some sub-
jects, BMI may not reflect the true adiposity in the
classification of weight status.
In summary, the current study demonstrated that
although physicians took into consideration pa-
tients' weight status in their recommendations of
lifestyle modifications in hypertension manage-
ment, patients' adherence did not follow this
pattern. In particular, obese patients who probably
would benefit most from weight control and exercise
were not more likely to adhere than normal/under-
weight patients. More aggressive approaches should
be taken by the physicians to educate obese patients
about the benefits of lifestyle modifications in

2. The adherence rate to lifestyle modifications was lower than that to medications. Low-to-moderate adherence rates were observed in
hypertensive patients
3. Obese patients were more likely to avoid medical care and prevention
4. Obesity and nonadherence to medications were clustered with nonadherence to lifestyle modifications among hypertensive patients
It was unknown
1. Whether a physician's recommendation of lifestyle modifications was associated with a hypertensive patient's BP level and weight
status
2. Whether weight status was a predictor independent of BP level in physicians' recommendation of lifestyle modifications
3. Whether obese and overweight hypertensive patients were less likely to adhere to the recommendation of lifestyle modifications,
controlling for BP levels and other confounding factors
Evidence from the current study
1. Physicians take into consideration both BP level and weight status in recommending lifestyle modifications
2. Obesity, independent of the BP level, increases the likelihood of the recommendation of weight control, sodium intake and exercise
3. Weight status does not predict adherence; neither does BP level
