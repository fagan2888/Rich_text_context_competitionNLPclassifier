Context: Althoughchildhoodadversities(CAs)areknown
to be highly co-occurring, most research examines their
associations with psychiatric disorders one at a time. How-
ever, recent evidence from adult studies suggests that the
associations of multiple CAs with psychiatric disorders are
nonadditive, arguing for the importance of multivariate
analysis of multiple CAs. To our knowledge, no attempt
has been made to perform a similar kind of analysis among
children or adolescents.
Objective: To examine the multivariate associations of
12 CAs with first onset of psychiatric disorders in a na-
tional sample of US adolescents.
Design: A US national survey of adolescents (age range,
13-17 years) assessing DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behav-
ior, and substance use disorders and CAs. The CAs in-
clude parental loss (death, divorce, and other separa-
tions), maltreatment (neglect and physical, sexual, and
emotional abuse), and parental maladjustment (vio-
lence, criminality, substance abuse, and psychopathol-
ogy), as well as economic adversity.
Setting: Dual-frame household-school samples.
Participants: In total, 6483 adolescent-parent pairs.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime DSM-IV disor-
ders assessed using the World Health Organization Com-
posite International Diagnostic Interview.
Results: Overall, exposure to at least 1 CA was reported
by 58.3% of adolescents, among whom 59.7% reported
multiple CAs. The CAs reflecting maladaptive family func-
tioning were more strongly associated than other CAs with
the onset of psychiatric disorders. The best-fitting model
included terms for the type and number of CAs and dis-
tinguished between maladaptive family functioning and
other CAs. The CAs predicted behavior disorders most
strongly and fear disorders least strongly. The joint asso-
ciationsofmultipleCAsweresubadditive.Thepopulation-
attributableriskproportionsacrossDSM-IVdisorderclasses
ranged from 15.7% for fear disorders to 40.7% for behav-
ior disorders. The CAs were associated with 28.2% of all
onsets of psychiatric disorders.
Conclusions: Childhood adversities are common, highly
co-occurring,andstronglyassociatedwiththeonsetofpsy-
chiatric disorders among US adolescents. The subadditive
multivariate associations of CAs with the onset of psychi-
atric disorders have implications for targeting interven-
tions to reduce exposure to CAs and to mitigate the harm-
ful effects of CAs to improve population mental health.

CHILDHOOD ADVERSITIES
(CAs) are among the most
consistently documented
risk factors for psychiat-
ric disorders.1-6 Research
has shown that several different CAs, in-
cluding parental death, abuse, neglect, and
family violence, are strongly related to
mental disorders.6-10 Research has also
shown that these diverse CAs often co-
occur.3,11-13 However, despite this evi-
dence of co-occurrence, most research has
focused on single CAs7-9,14 or on a count
of the number of CAs as predictors of men-
tal disorders.1,3,15 This has led to an over-
estimation of the effects of individual CAs
and to the neglect of potentially impor-
tant multivariate CA profiles. Recent stud-
ies4,16 using retrospective CA reports
among adults have tried to address this
problem by investigating multivariate as-
sociations of numerous CAs with mental
disorders. These studies documented
strong nonadditive associations of CAs re-
lated to maladaptive family functioning,
including maltreatment and parental mal-
adjustment, with adult mental disorders.
However, the use of retrospective reports
of CAs in these studies could have intro-
duced systematic recall bias into the re-
sults.4,17,18 To our knowledge, no attempt
has been made to perform a similar kind

of analysis among children or adolescents. We report such
data in the present study based on analysis of the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-
ment (NCS-A),19 a national survey of the prevalence and
correlates of DSM-IV disorders among US adolescents.
METHODS
SAMPLE
As previously reported in more detail,20 the NCS-A was per-
formed between February 5, 2001, and January 31, 2004. Ado-
lescents aged 13 to 17 years were interviewed face to face in
dual-framehousehold-schoolsamples.20,21 Thehouseholdsample
included adolescents who were recruited from households that
participated in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R).22 A total of 879 school-attending adolescents partici-
pated in the household survey, with a response rate of 86.8%
(conditional on adult participation in the NCS-R). The remain-
der of the sample included 9244 adolescents recruited from a
representative sample of schools in NCS-R sample areas. The
adolescent response rate in the school sample was 82.6% (con-
ditional on school participation). The total NCS-A sample, com-
bining household and school samples, included 10 123 ado-
lescents. Although the proportion of initially selected schools
that participated in the NCS-A was low (28.0%), replacement
schools were carefully matched to the original schools. Com-
parison of household sample respondents from nonparticipat-
ing schools with school sample respondents from replace-
ment schools demonstrated no evidence of bias in estimates of
prevalence or correlates of mental disorders.20
One parent or guardian was asked to complete a self-
administered questionnaire (SAQ) about the participating ado-
lescent's developmental history and mental health. The SAQ
response rates (conditional on adolescent participation) were
82.5% in the household sample and 83.7% in the school sample.
Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guard-
ians before approaching adolescents. Written adolescent as-
sent was then obtained from adolescents before surveying ado-
lescents or parents. Each respondent was given $50 for
participation. These recruitment and consent procedures were
approved by the human subjects committees of Harvard Medi-
cal School and the University of Michigan. This study focuses
on 6483 adolescent-parent pairs for whom data were available
from both adolescent interviews and SAQs.
Once the survey was completed, cases were weighted for
variation in within-household probability of selection in the
household sample and residual discrepancies between sample
and population sociodemographic and geographic distribu-
tions. The household and school samples were then merged
with sums of weights proportional to relative sample sizes ad-
justed for design effects in estimating disorder prevalence. These
weighting procedures are detailed elsewhere.20 The weighted
sociodemographic distributions of the composite sample closely
approximate those of the census population.21
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
Adolescents were administered a modified version of the World
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview (CIDI),23 a fully structured interview administered by
trained lay interviewers. Previous factor analysis of lifetime
DSM-IV disorders in the NCS-A demonstrated that they differ-
entiated into the following 4 disorder classes24: (1) fear disor-
ders (social phobia, specific phobia, intermittent explosive dis-
order, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and
agoraphobia without history of panic disorder), (2) distress dis-
orders (separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety dis-
order, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major de-
pressive disorder or dysthymia), (3) behavior disorders (conduct
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder), and (4) substance use disorders (al-
cohol abuse with or without dependence and drug abuse with
or without dependence). Although our finding that internal-
izing disorders are best represented by separate fear and dis-
tress dimensions is consistent with previous research,25,26 it is
unclear how these dimensions will map onto the domains re-
cently proposed in the National Institute of Mental Health re-
search domain criteria.27
Parents provided information about adolescent symptoms
of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and major depressive disorder or
dysthymia, disorders for which parent reports have previ-
ously been shown to have a large role in diagnosis.28,29 Parent
and adolescent reports were combined at the symptom level
using an "or" rule, such that a symptom was considered pres-
ent if it was endorsed by either respondent. All the diagnoses
were made using DSM-IV organic exclusion rules. All but 2 di-
agnoses were made using DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy rules.
The exceptions were oppositional defiant disorder, which was
defined with or without conduct disorder, and substance abuse,
which was defined with or without dependence.
In clinical reappraisal study,30 a subsample of NCS-A respon-
dents was blindly reinterviewed using the Schedule for Affec-
tive Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children­
PresentandLifetimeVersion(K-SADS).Asreportedinmoredetail
elsewhere,31 concordance between lifetime CIDI or SAQ and K-
SADS diagnoses was good, with areas under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve of 0.81 to 0.94 for fear disorders, 0.79
to 0.87 for distress disorders, 0.78 to 0.98 for behavior disor-
ders, 0.56 to 0.98 for substance use disorders, and 0.87 for any
disorder. Diagnoses of intermittent explosive disorder were not
validated because this is not assessed in the K-SADS.
Childhood Adversities
The NCS-A interviews and parent SAQs assessed 12 CAs. These
included 3 types of interpersonal loss (parental death, paren-
tal divorce, and other loss of contact with parents or care-
givers), 4 types of parental maladjustment (mental illness, sub-
stance abuse, criminality, and family violence), 4 types of
maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse,
and neglect), and family economic adversity. Parental death and
divorce were assessed only for biological parents, not steppar-
ents or other caregivers. However, the measure of other loss of
contact with parents or caregivers included any disruption of
a relationship that lasted for 6 months or longer that involved
a caregiver leaving the respondent's home (eg, the biological
mother abandoned the family) or the respondent leaving home
(eg, the individual was placed in foster care or was adopted).
Respondents who were born to a single mother and never ex-
perienced any further disruption of this parenting arrange-
ment were not coded as experiencing parental loss. We did not
code separations from caregivers that involved the respondent
being placed in a juvenile detention center or running away from
home. We collected information on timing (ie, the respon-
dent's age) for all parental loss events.
Physical and emotional abuse of the respondent by parents
or caregivers was assessed using a modified version of the Con-
flict Tactics Scales.32 Sexual abuse was assessed with questions
from the CIDI about sexual assault, attempted rape, and rape.

Information was also collected on the age at which sexual abuse
first occurred. Neglect was assessed with a battery of questions
used in investigations of child welfare that asked about the fre-
quencies of having inadequate supervision, being required to
do chores that were age inappropriate, and not receiving ad-
equate food, clothing, or medical care.33 Parental criminality
was assessed with questions in the CIDI and the SAQ about
whether a parent had engaged in criminal activities like bur-
glary or the sale of stolen property or had ever been arrested or
sent to prison for criminal activity.5 Parental mental illness (ma-
jordepression,generalizedanxietydisorder,panicdisorder,and
suicide attempt) and substance abuse were assessed using the
Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria Interview34 and its
extensions,35 as well as with items completed by parents in the
SAQ. Family violence was assessed using the modified Con-
flict Tactics Scales and an item in the trauma section of the CIDI
about the respondent's age when he or she first observed in-
terparentalviolence.Economicadversitywasassessedwithques-
tions in the SAQ about whether the respondent's family had
received welfare or other government assistance or often did
not have enough money to pay for basic necessities of living.
ANALYSIS
The associations of dichotomously scored CAs with first onset
of psychiatric disorders were estimated using discrete-time sur-
vival analysis with person-years as the unit of analysis,36 con-
trolling for respondent sex, age at interview, race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), and
additional DSM-IV/CIDI disorders with the onset before the fo-
cal disorder under investigation. The controls for earlier-
onset disorders were included to adjust for the associations of
CAs with previous disorders and the associations of these dis-
orders with subsequent disorder onset. Several multivariate mod-
els were estimated using the modeling approach developed in
earlier work on this topic.4,16 Each model included dummy pre-
dictor variables for CAs and controls. Model 1 was a series of
bivariate models (ie, one CA at a time predicting disorders).
Model 2 was an additive model that included a separate pre-
dictor variable for each of 12 CAs. Model 3 included predictor
variables for a number of CAs without variables for specific types
of CAs. Model 4 included 12 predictors for the type of CA and
additional predictors for the number of CAs, with the latter rep-
resenting nonspecific interactions. Model 5 modified model 4
by including separate counts of CAs associated with indica-
tors of maltreatment and parental maladjustment or with other
CAs. This distinction was based on evidence in our earlier adult
study4 that maltreatment and parental maladjustment, which
we refer to collectively as indicators of maladaptive family func-
tioning (MFF), were more important than other CAs in pre-
dicting psychiatric disorders. Model 6 modified the counts in
model 5 to distinguish aspects of MFF associated with harsh
treatment of the adolescent (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-
tional abuse, and neglect) from other aspects of MFF (divorce,
interparental violence, parent mental illness, substance use dis-
order, and criminality) based on the results of a factor analysis
in the NCS-A that found this distinction in the data. Detailed
results of the factor analysis are available on request. Model 7
included predictors not only for the type and number of CAs
but also for interactions between the type and number.
The Akaike information criterion (AIC)37 and the Bayesian
information criteria (BIC)38 were used to select the best mul-
tivariate model among models 2 through 7 to predict first on-
set of any disorder based on a consolidated data file that stacked
14 separate disorder-specific person-year data arrays and in-
cluded 13 dummy variables to distinguish among these files,
thereby forcing the estimated slopes of disorders on CAs to be
constant across 14 disorders. This best-fitting specification was
then used to predict first onset of psychiatric disorders within
each of 4 DSM-IV disorder classes (fear, distress, behavior, and
substance use disorders). Survival coefficients (standard er-
rors [SEs]) were exponentiated and are reported as odds ra-
tios (ORs) and 95% CIs.
The population-attributable risk proportions (PARPs) for the
outcomes were computed for the best-fitting model to provide
a sense of the overall importance of CAs in predicting adoles-
cent psychiatric disorders. The PARP is the proportion of ob-
served disorders that would not have occurred in the absence of
CAs if the associations described in the survival coefficients re-
flect causal effects of CAs.39 Although it is inappropriate to infer
causality from nonexperimental data, the calculation of the PARP
is nonetheless useful to provide a sense of the magnitude of the
associations. The PARP was calculated using simulation meth-
ods to generate individual-level predicted probabilities of psy-
chiatric disorders from the coefficients in the best-fitting model
with and without coefficients for CAs. The PARP is equal to 1
minus the ratio of the predicted prevalence estimates in the 2
specifications.ThePARPforthepooleddatasetisthemeanPARP
across all psychiatric disorders based on a constant model across
disorders. All significance tests were evaluated using 2-sided
P.05. The design-based Taylor series method implemented in
a software system (SUDAAN; Research Triangle Institute40) was
used to estimate SEs.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE AND CO-OCCURRENCE OF CAs
More than half (58.3%) of NCS-A adolescent respon-
dents reported exposure to at least 1 CA (Table 1). The
most common CAs were parental divorce (28.4%), pa-
rental criminality (26.3%), family economic adversity
(16.2%), and parental mental illness (15.6%). Most re-
spondents with at least 1 CA reported exposure to mul-
tiple CAs, with the rates of co-occurrence ranging from
70.9% for parental divorce to 97.9% for neglect. The mean
number of CAs among respondents with exposure to more
than 1 CA was 3.2.
ASSOCIATIONS OF CAs WITH FIRST ONSET
OF DSM-IV DISORDERS
In the bivariate models (model 1) that considered only
one CA at a time, all 12 CAs were significant predictors
of the DSM-IV disorders considered in pooled models,
with ORs ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 for MFF CAs and from
1.3 to 1.6 for other CAs (Table 2). The ORs were at-
tenuated in the additive multivariate model (model 2),
which corrects for overestimation of the associations in-
volving individual CAs in bivariate models. Nine CAs re-
mained significant in model 2, with ORs ranging from
1.2 to 1.4 for MFF CAs and from 1.1 to 1.2 for other CAs.
The test for the joint associations of all CAs in this model
was significant (2
12
= 775.3), as were the tests for the joint
associations of MFF CAs (2
8
= 291.8) and other CAs
(2
4
= 28.0) (P  .001 for all). A test for variation in ORs
was also significant, indicating that the strength of the
ORs varied across CAs (2
11
= 25.4, P = .008).
The multivariate model that considered only the num-
ber and not the type of CAs (model 3) showed increas-

ing ORs with the number of CAs, ranging from 1.8
for exactly 1 CA to 4.6 for 6 CAs. The test for the joint
associations of the number of CAs was significant
(2

= 320.6, P  .001). However, subsequent models that
included information about both the type and number
of CAs had better measures of fit based on the AIC and

CAsfromotherCAsbutdidnotfurtherdelineatetheMFF
CAs into those directed at the adolescent (ie, abuse or
neglect) vs those that involved parental maladjustment.
Detailed results of model fitting are available on request.
In this model, the types of CAs were significant as a set
after controlling for the numbers of CAs (2
12
= 113.4),
and the numbers of MFF CAs were significant as a set
aftercontrollingforthetypesofCAs(2

= 24.1)(P  .001
for both) (Table 3). However, the joint test for the num-
ber of other CAs was not significant (2
2
= 5.6, P = .06).
As in the additive model, this model showed variation
in the strength of the ORs across CA types (2
11
= 34.0,
P  .001), with MFF CAs having consistently higher ORs
than other CAs. The ORs associated with CA types in this
model were generally higher than those in the additive
model, indicating that the additivity assumption led to a
downward bias in the estimated associations of indi-
vidual CAs with psychiatric disorders. This bias oc-
curredbecausetheORsassociatedwiththenumberofCAs
in the more complex model were generally less than 1.0
and became increasingly smaller as the number of CAs
increased. This pattern of subadditive interactions in-
dicates that the odds of disorder onset increased at a
significantly decreasing rate as the number of CAs in-
creased. This best-fitting model is the one used in sub-
sequent disaggregated analyses.

AND TYPE OF DSM-IV DISORDER

of CAs and 8 for the numbers of CAs) across 4 DSM-IV

aSee the first footnote 1 in Table 2 for a description of the overall modeling approach. The model shown herein was estimated with predictors for the types
of CAs and the numbers of CAs (distinguishing the number of maladaptive family functioning CAs from the number of other CAs) in addition to the controls used
in the models in Table 2. Note that no term was included in the model for having exactly one CA. This means that the coefficients for the types of CAs can be
interpreted as the associations of pure CAs (ie, having one and only one particular type of CA compared with having none) with the onset, whereas the
associations with the number of CAs represent the extent to which the incremental associations of co-occurring CAs (ie, the added risk of an additional CA
in respondents who are otherwise equivalent in terms of the number of other CAs, controlling for the types of other CAs) differ from the associations of pure CAs.

of CAs were always associated with increased odds of dis-
order onset jointly (range, 2

P  .001). Eight types of CAs were associated with the
onset of behavior and substance use disorders, 6 with dis-
tress disorders, and 4 with fear disorders. The MFF CAs
were significantly associated with the onset of fear, dis-
tress, and substance use disorders (range, 2
8
= 28.3 to

8
= 51.7, P  .001) but not with behavior disorders
(2

ders (range, 2

4

of MFF CAs were associated with significantly de-

(range, 2

but not with distress and behavior disorders (range,

6

associated with the number of other CAs were not sig-

The joint associations of 20 CA coefficients with in-
dividual psychiatric disorder onsets also varied within
each of the DSM-IV disorder classes (range, 2

=136.9
to 2
20-100
= 390.6; P  .001). Detailed results are avail-
able from the authors on request. For fear disorders, CAs
were most consistently associated with social phobia, spe-
cific phobia, and intermittent explosive disorder and were
unrelated to agoraphobia or panic disorder. For distress
disorders, CAs were most strongly and consistently as-
sociated with PTSD, followed by major depressive dis-
order or dysthymia; they were related less consistently
to generalized anxiety disorder and were largely unre-
lated to separation anxiety disorder. For behavior disor-
ders, CAs were associated most consistently with atten-
tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Finally, CAs for
substance use disorders were more consistently associ-
ated with alcohol abuse or dependence than with sub-
stance abuse or dependence.
DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATIONS BY SEX
AND RACE/ETHNICITY
To evaluate whether the associations of CAs with psy-
chiatric disorder onsets differed for male vs female re-
spondents, we added interactions between sex and both
the type and the number of CAs to the best-fitting model.
The BIC indicated that the additive model fit the data best,
while the AIC indicated that the interactive model fit best.
Global 2 tests for the overall significance of interac-
tions between CAs and sex were significant in predict-
ing any disorder, as well as each of 4 DSM-IV disorder
classes (range, 2
20
= 47.4 to 2
20
= 413.9; P  .001). In-
spection of individual interactions found 12.0% to be sig-
nificant at P  .05. However, no clear pattern of results
was apparent overall or for particular classes of CAs or
disorders. Detailed results are available on request.
Wealsoaddedinteractionsbetweenrace/ethnicity(non-
Hispanic black and Hispanic vs others) and both the type
and number of CAs. The AIC and the BIC indicated that
the interactive model fit best. Overall interactions be-
tween CAs and race/ethnicity were significant in predict-
ing any disorder, as well as each of 4 classes of disorders
(range, 2

spondents; P  .001 for both). However, inspection of in-
dividual interactions revealed no clear pattern of results,
and only 6.0% of interactions were significant at P  .05.
Detailed results are available on request.
POPULATION-LEVEL ASSOCIATIONS OF CAs
WITH DISORDER ONSET
The PARPs for the outcomes associated with CAs based
on the best-fitting model showed that CAs explain (in a
predictive rather than a causal sense) 28.2% of all psy-
chiatric disorders, 15.7% of fear disorders, 32.2% of dis-
tress disorders, 40.7% of behavior disorders, and 34.4%
of substance use disorders (Table 4). The MFF CAs were
more important than other CAs (23.7% vs 6.4%). The
most important individual CAs were parental criminal-
ity (9.2%) and parental mental illness (6.8%).
COMMENT
The results herein are limited in several ways. First, al-
though recall bias is expected to be less extreme in a sur-
vey of adolescents than adults, recall bias is still a pos-
sibility in NCS-A retrospective reports of CAs and lifetime
disorders. Special procedures shown experimentally to
improve the accuracy of reporting the age at onset of de-
pression41 were used to address this problem, but recall
bias is impossible to eliminate completely. Second, our
analysis focused on the sample of adolescents for whom
we were able to obtain parent SAQs. It is possible that
parents of adolescents with higher exposure to CAs were
less likely to provide these SAQs, resulting in underes-
timation of CA prevalence. Third, the NCS-A assessed
only the timing of discrete CAs (parental loss events and
sexual abuse), which means that some psychiatric dis-
order onsets may have occurred before the CAs that we
used as predictors. Reverse causation is a particular con-
cern for behavior disorders because disruptive behavior
problems are known to increase the likelihood of harsh
parenting.42,43 This limitation is especially important be-
cause the associations of CAs with psychopathology may
vary depending on the timing of exposure.44,45 Fourth,
the NCS-A lacks information on the frequency or sever-
ity of CAs. The stronger associations for MFF CAs than
for other CAs might, at least in part, be owing to this limi-
tation. Fifth, our definition of CA was not exhaustive.
We focused specifically on family-related adversities, con-
sistent with previous work,12,15 but numerous other ad-
versities are associated with elevated risk for early-onset
psychopathology.46-48
Within the context of these limitations, the NCS-A re-
sults suggest the following: that most US adolescents have
been exposed to at least 1 of the CAs considered herein,
that exposure to multiple CAs is the norm among those
exposed, that many of these CAs are significant corre-
lates of child-adolescent mental disorders, that MFF CAs

are of special importance in this regard, and that the joint
associations of multiple CAs are subadditive. These re-
sults are consistent with the findings in parallel stud-
ies4,16 of adults. The NCS-A results are similar for boys
and girls and for adolescents from different racial/
ethnic backgrounds, a finding that is consistent with some
previous studies.49,50 We did not investigate whether the
associations vary as a function of socioeconomic status
or other sociodemographic characteristics of respon-
dents. This is a subject for future research.
The NCS-A results diverge in one way from previous
adult studies,4,16 in that the latter investigations found little
evidence of differential CA associations by disorder type.
However, substantial variation of this sort is apparent in
the NCS-A because CAs are associated most strongly with
behavior and substance use disorders and least strongly
with fear disorders. The particularly strong associations
with substance use disorders and behavior disorders may
reflect the relationships of CAs with the development of
brain areas related to impulsivity,51,52 a possibility that
warrants additional investigation in future research. One
explanation for the more specific pattern of associations
in adolescents than in adults is that many of the disor-
ders unassociated with CAs in the NCS-A typically be-
gin after adolescence.53 To evaluate this possibility, we
conducted a more detailed analysis examining the asso-
ciations of CAs with individual disorders and found that
the CAs considered herein generally have the strongest
associations within DSM-IV disorder classes with the dis-
orders that have early ages at onset.53 For example, within
the fear disorders, CAs are more strongly associated with
specific phobia and social phobia than with panic disor-
der or agoraphobia. This means that CAs are especially
important in promoting the onset of temporally pri-
mary disorders that, in turn, predict subsequent onsets
of temporally secondary disorders.24 The one exception
to this pattern is distress disorders, in which CAs are un-
related to separation anxiety disorder, the disorder shown
in previous research to have the earliest onset,24 and are
associated most strongly with PTSD, a condition with the
latest onset. The especially strong associations of CAs with
PTSD in the NCS-A are consistent with prospective evi-
dence indicating that CAs have particularly strong pre-
dictive associations with this disorder.54
With regard to differential associations across CAs, pre-
vious research identified stronger associations of sexual
abuse than other CAs with subsequent onset of psychi-
atric disorders after accounting for other CAs.9,55-57 This
pattern was observed in the NCS-A as well. Indeed, the
OR associated with sexual abuse was the largest or sec-
ond largest in predicting 3 (fear, distress, and substance
abuse) of 4 DSM-IV disorder classes, as well as for 6 in-
dividual disorders in these classes. Behavior disorders were
the only outcomes for which sexual abuse was not among
the strongest predictors. This pattern is consistent with
our findings from an adult study.4
Theevidenceofstrongco-occurrenceamongCAsisalso
consistent with previous work in adult samples4,16 and with
prior studies12,58,59 of CAs in children and in adults. This
high degree of co-occurrence suggests that previous stud-
ies focused on single CAs likely overestimated the impor-
tance of those CAs. Furthermore, although the magni-
tude of the associations of individual CAs with psychiatric
disorders is uniformly attenuated after adjustment for co-
occurring CAs, virtually all the CAs continue to have sig-
nificant associations with disorders in multivariate mod-
els. This documents that no single CA or small group of
CAs captures the full range of CA effects.
The results of the PARP analysis show that CAs are
associated with a substantial proportion of child-
adolescent psychiatric disorder onsets, including more
than 40% of behavior disorder onsets and one-third of
distress and substance use disorder onsets. This is con-
sistent with previous work in adult samples,4,16 although

aThe PARPs were calculated using simulation methods to generate individual-level predicted probabilities of the outcome disorders twice from the coefficients
in the best-fitting model, the first time using all the coefficients in the model (probability of the disorder in those exposed to CAs) and the second time assuming
that the coefficients associated with CAs were all zero (probability of the disorder in those unexposed). One minus the ratio of the predicted prevalence estimates
in the 2 specifications was then used to calculate the PARPs.

CAs are associated with larger proportions of distress dis-
orders (32.2% vs 26.2%) and substance use disorders
(34.4%vs21.0%)amongadolescentsvsintheadultNCS-R
data. Because distress and substance use disorders have
later ages at onset,53 this pattern suggests that CAs may
havealargerroleinpredictingchild-adolescentonsetvari-
ants of certain distress and substance use disorders. In
contrast, CAs are associated with a smaller proportion
of anxiety disorders in adolescents vs in the adult data
(15.7% vs 32.4%), despite the fact that CAs are associ-
ated more strongly with early-onset than later-onset anxi-
ety disorders. The large PARPs in the NCS-A suggest that
CAs are important as determinants of child-adolescent
onsets of psychiatric mental disorders (causal risk fac-
tors)orasmarkersofotherdeterminants(riskmarkers).60
As such, they represent promising targets for interven-
tion efforts.
The NCS-A data cannot distinguish between the pos-
sibility that CAs are causal risk factors rather than merely
risk markers. Only experimental studies can provide de-
finitive adjudication between these 2 possibilities. How-
ever, experiments that randomly assign youth to expo-
sure to CAs are virtually nonexistent, and interventions
that randomly assign youth to interventions aimed at ame-
liorating the effects of these exposures are rare. The exis-
tence of subadditive interactions among co-occurring CAs
has important implications for intervention planning be-
cause the presence of these interactions implies that in-
terventions aimed at protecting high-risk youth ex-
posed to many CAs are unlikely to have strong effects if
they target only a subset of the adversities to which these
youth are exposed. The ameliorative effects of incremen-
tal reductions in CAs would be expected to be small if
harmful effects of incremental increases in CAs are small.
We would consequently expect interventions that ad-
dress a large number of CAs (eg, home visiting pro-
grams aimed at preventing many different types of child
maltreatment61 or foster care62) to have much more pow-
erful effects than interventions targeted at only one CA.63,64
Alternatively, given the strong co-occurrence of the CAs
examined herein with parental psychopathology, inter-
ventions aimed at treating parents with psychiatric dis-
orders may also result in reductions in other CAs, such
as maltreatment, criminal behavior, and family vio-
lence. Indeed, some evidence suggests that successful
treatment of parental disorders can reduce psychopa-
thology in children.65 We are unaware of any attempts
to measure CAs among youth in such interventions, but
this would be useful information to obtain to allow an
assessment of the extent to which intervention effects vary
as a function of the number and type of CAs.
