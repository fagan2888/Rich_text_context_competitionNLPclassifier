Screening guidelines proposed by the Expert Committee on the
Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus have been en-
dorsed by several medical societies. However, one-third of cases
are undiagnosed, and complications at the time of diagnosis
indicate that disease may have been present for several years
before diagnosis. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the
guidelines for detecting new cases of diabetes mellitus. By using a
cross-sectional, representative sample of the United States (Na-
tional Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES III), the
guidelines are tested on adults, 20 years and older without a prior
diagnosis of diabetes. Individuals are classified as nondiabetics
(n  6,241) or as having undiagnosed diabetes (n  274) based on
their blood glucose. Screening when one risk factor is present, as
stated in the guidelines, has a true-positive rate of 100% and
would require that 83% of the population be tested. Screening
when two risk factors are present is more efficient, with a com-
parable true-positive rate (98%), but requires that only 59% of the
population be tested. A notable finding is the earlier age of onset
among minorities, which may be associated with other health
disparities. Because diabetes occurs at younger ages in minorities,
screening whites who are >40 and minorities >30 years of age has
a high true-positive rate (95%) and also reduces testing (60%). The
screening guidelines would be effective, if followed, and would
essentially eliminate undiagnosed cases of diabetes.
The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of
Diabetes Mellitus (1) has proposed guidelines for diabetes
mellitus testing in asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals. Al-
though screening is not recommended in the general adult
population, it is recommended for individuals with one or more
risk factors (Table 1). Screening is recommended at 3-year
intervals beginning at age 45 years, with earlier andor more
frequent screening for individuals with other risk factors (1).
Because these guidelines are generally considered the standard
for diabetes screening (several professional societies have
adopted the guidelines), we evaluate their ability to detect new
cases of diabetes in a U.S. national sample. The recommenda-
tions proposed by the Expert Committee are based on a review
of scientific evidence, but their sensitivity for detection of new
cases of diabetes has not been tested.
Diabetes is a national health problem in the Unites States. It
is associated with micro- and macrovascular disease resulting in
significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is a class of met-
abolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. The two most
prevalent types are distinguished by a lack of insulin (type 1) or
insufficient insulin (type 2) to metabolize glucose (1). Among
adults, diabetes is among the leading causes of death (2, 3) and
is the number one cause of new cases of legal blindness (20- to
74-year-olds) (4), end-stage renal disease (5), and lower-
extremity amputations (6). Direct costs for medical services and
indirect costs because of lost productivity due to diabetes
approached 132 billion dollars in 2002 (7). The prevalence of
diabetes (physician-diagnosed and undiagnosed) among adults
(20 years) is 7.8% (8) and has risen during the past decade. For
those 40­74 years of age, the prevalence of diabetes has in-
creased from 8.9% (1976­1980) to 12.3% (1988­1994) (8). The
increased prevalence is most likely due to increased incidence
and not decreased mortality (9) or improved case detection.
Because intervention trials (10­14) have demonstrated that
improved glycemia can prevent or delay complications, an early
diagnosis and appropriate management of diabetes should be a
priority.
Diagnostic and screening guidelines have been developed by
an expert panel (1). Diagnosis is made when hyperglycemia is
present, as measured by a FPG test (FPG  126 mgdl) (1).
Screening is recommended for those 45 years of age and older;
with repeated testing every 3 years if results are normal. Screen-
ing also should be considered at younger ages or at more
frequent intervals for those who have diabetes risk factors
(Table 1) (1).
The guidelines have been adopted by the American Academy
of Family Physicians (15), the American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists (www.aace.com), and the International Diabe-
tes Center (16). The latter two groups added risk factors
(acanthosis nigricans and cardiovascular disease), and the en-
docrinologists recommended screening at 30 years, if other risk
factors are present. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(17), the Canadian Task Force (18), and the American College
of Physicians (19) have more ambiguous recommendations and
suggest screening those who are obese, older, or the member of
a racialethnic minority, or who have a family history of diabetes.
Unfortunately, one third of diabetes cases (probably type 2)
are undiagnosed (8). Also, the presence of microvascular disease
(specifically, retinopathy) at the time of diagnosis suggests that
disease may be present for 2­10 years before diagnosis (20). The
question is whether the guidelines are sufficient to detect most
cases of diabetes. The use of risk factors to identify individuals

with diabetes has had mixed results. Studies comparing the
presence of risk factors and blood glucose values have found
true-positive rates of 62­85% (21­29). These studies, however,
relied on a variety of variables measured in clinical samples.
Samples without variation in ethnicity (all white) or samples with
a truncated age range (21­23, 25, 26, 28) are not appropriate for
generalizing to the U.S. population. Alternatively, it is possible
that the guidelines are sufficient, but that they are not being
followed. In the 1989 National Health Interview Survey, only
38.6% of those without a history of diabetes but with three
diabetes risk factors reported being screened and only 57.1% of
those with four or more risk factors reported being screened
(30). Minorities have disproportionately higher rates of compli-
cations and mortality because of diabetes, and it is not known if
these disparities are due to a delay in diagnosis (31).
This study examines the performance of screening guidelines
for identifying undiagnosed diabetes in a national sample. We
focus on only the risk factors included in the guidelines and test
their ability to detect new or undiagnosed cases of diabetes in the
U.S. population. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III) (32, 33) provides information that
parallels the screening problem, namely, the detection of undi-
agnosed cases of diabetes in the general population. The
NHANES III includes data on seven of the risk factors in Table
1. In addition, the study includes FPG results for a sample of
individuals without a prior diagnosis of diabetes. The relative
importance of risk factors in identifying new cases of diabetes can
be obtained by comparing those with undiagnosed diabetes
(FPG  126) with those without diabetes (FPG  126). More
importantly, their efficacy in detecting new cases of diabetes can
be estimated by calculating the true-positive rate for the screen-
ing guidelines.
Methods
Data Source and Sample. The NHANES III is based on a stratified,
multistage probability sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. civil-
ians (1988­1994), with an oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans. The complex survey design included
sample weights for population estimates, because each person
does not have the same probability of selection. Only subjects
identified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mex-
ican American were eligible for the study. Included individuals
who did not specifically self-identify as one of these groups were
categorized as ``other'' (32, 33). In this article, these groups are
referred to as white, African American, Mexican American, and
other.
The sample for this study included nonpregnant adults (20
years of age) who had a physical examination, morning veni-
puncture, and an interview (n  7,703). Of those, 574 had a prior
diagnosis of diabetes (excluding gestational diabetes) and were
excluded. For those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes, only
those who had fasted between 8 and 24 h and had a FPG
measurement were included (n  6,515). Those who had a
FPG  126 mgdl were categorized as undiagnosed diabetics
(n  274), and those who had a FPG  126 mgdl were
categorized as nondiabetics (n  6,241).
Measures and Analysis. The main outcome variable, diabetes
status, was defined with two categories of subjects: those with
undiagnosed diabetes and those without diabetes. The two
groups were compared in terms of their risk factors: age (45
years); ethnicity; positive family history (parent or sibling with
diabetes); overweightobesity (measured by BMI  25 and
BMI  30 kgm2) (34); history of gestational diabetes; a prior
diagnosis of hypertension or a current hypertensive reading; and
their lipid profile (HDLs and triglycerides). Information was not
available for history of macrosomic infant (9 pounds) or
dysglycemia (e.g., 110  FPG  126 mgdl). Thus, the first seven
risk factors in Table 1 were considered for analysis. Descriptive
statistics (percentages and odds ratios) were obtained for the
groups for all risk factors. A simple, main effects logistic
regression (35) model was used to estimate the relative strength
of the risk factors in distinguishing those with and without
diabetes. Odds ratios [and 95% Taylor series confidence inter-
vals (C.I.)] for risk factors were obtained from logistic regression
models. All risk factors were dichotomized to parallel the
screening guidelines and to facilitate comparisons of the relative
magnitude of the odds ratios across variables. All analyses
include weighting and design factors with SAS (36) and SUDAAN
(37). The purpose of weighting the sample data is to allow
estimates of statistics that would have been obtained if the entire
sampling frame (the United States) had been surveyed. The
true-positive (hit rate) and false-positive (false alarm) rates were
estimated for the presence or absence of different combinations
of risk factors for detecting diabetes, and the proportion of the
population with each combination of risk factors.
Results
Relative Importance of Risk Factors for Detecting Undiagnosed Dia-
betes. Half of the sample was female (51.80%), 23.24% had less
than a high school education, and 11.82% had no health insur-
ance (Table 2). Those who were 45 years of age and older
constituted 42.35% of the total sample, 83.97% of those with
undiagnosed diabetes, and 41.11% of those without diabetes.
Those who were 45 years and older were 7.50 (95% C.I.  4.37,
12.89) times more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than were
those who were younger than 45 years. Compared with persons
without diabetes, those with diabetes were older, had a first-
degree relative with diabetes, were overweight or obese, had
hypertension, and had a poor lipid profile (Table 2). The effect
of most variables was reduced when all were considered simul-
taneously. Each variable had 2% missing data with 5%
missing for the combined logistic regression analysis (n  6,214;
undiagnosed diabetes n  261 and n  5,953 in nondiabetics). In
model 1 (Table 3), all the risk factors except gestational diabetes
were used. In model 2, risk factors and gestational diabetes were
tested for women only.
In the general population, the strongest risk factor is older age.
The bivariate odds ratio (OR) (Table 2) indicates that those 45
years of age are at 7.50 times greater risk for having undiagnosed
diabetes. When other risk factors are controlled for (Table 3,
model 1), those 45 years of age are at 5.84 (95% C.I.  3.41,
10.02 in model 1) times greater risk of having undiagnosed
diabetes than those 45 years of age. The odds of having
diabetes increase 1.05 times for each year increase in age (OR 
1.05, 95% C.I.  1.04, 1.06 with age as a continuous variable
replacing age 45 years in model 1, not shown). Diabetes,
however, occurs at an earlier age in the minority ethnic groups.
Among those with undiagnosed diabetes, the youngest individ-
uals were 34 years of age among whites, 27 years among African
Americans, and 24 years among Mexican Americans. The dis-
tribution of undiagnosed diabetes cases shows that 11.51% of
white, 28.09% of African American, and 52.84% of Mexican-
American individuals are 45 years of age (Table 4). The
45-year cutpoint for whites (where 12% of undiagnosed cases
are younger) is comparable with 34 years of age for African
Americans and 31 years for Mexican Americans.
The effect of ethnicity appears to be due to the younger age
distribution of undiagnosed cases among minorities. The simple,
bivariate OR (Table 2) indicates that the minority ethnic groups
are at 1.4 times greater risk than whites for having undiagnosed
The sample size (n  6,515) differs slightly from that of Harris et al. (8) (n  6,587), because
we used the recommended fasting time of at least 8 h (instead of 9) and we omitted
women who were pregnant at the time of the study.

diabetes. In the multivariate model (Table 3, model 1), Mexican
Americans and African Americans are twice as likely as whites
to have undiagnosed diabetes. However, when the age variable
is recoded to capture a comparable proportion of cases from
each ethnic group (45 for whites, 35 for African Americans,
32 for Mexican Americans, and 45 for other, model not
shown), the effects of ethnicity are no longer significant (African
Americans OR  1.28, 95% C.I.  0.91, 1.81; and Mexican
Americans OR  1.15, 95% C.I.  0.79, 1.69), and the remaining
variables are relatively unaffected, with the exception of an
increase in the effect of age (OR  6.64, 95% C.I.  3.36, 13.11).
A poor lipid profile (HDL  35 mgdl or triglycerides  250
mgdl) was the second strongest factor predicting undiagnosed
diabetes. The bivariate odds ratios indicated that risk was
increased approximately three times with a low HDL level,
whereas high triglycerides increased risk almost six times. In the
multivariate analysis, those with a low HDL or high triglyceride
level were four times more likely (OR  4.11, 95% C.I.  2.83,
5.98) to have diabetes than were those with high HDLs and low
triglycerides.
Obesity was the next strongest risk factor. The bivariate ORs
(Table 2) indicated that overweight or obese individuals were at
five times higher risk of diabetes. When all risk factors were
considered (Table 3, model 1), those who were overweight
(BMI  25 kgm2) were 2.83 (95% C.I.  1.77, 4.52) times more
likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than those with BMI  25
kgm2. When obesity was specified, those who were overweight
but not obese (25  BMI  30 kgm2) were 1.70 (95% C.I. 
1.01, 2.86) times more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes, and

those who were obese (BMI  30 kgm2) were 4.51 (95% C.I. 
2.66, 7.62) times more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than
those who were not overweight or obese (BMI  25 kgm2; three
categories of BMI in model 1, not shown). For each unit increase
in BMI, risk increased 1.09 times (95% C.I.  1.06, 1.12; BMI as
a continuous variable in model 1 instead of dichotomous, not
shown).
Hypertension and a family history of diabetes each approxi-
mately doubled the risk of diabetes (Table 3, model 1). In contrast,
women who had had gestational diabetes were at very high risk of
diabetes mellitus. In the multivariate model, the effect of gesta-
tional diabetes was stronger (OR  15.35, 95% C.I.  3.79, 62.10
in model 2) than for age, lipids, or obesity. When gestational
diabetes was tested for the entire population, it continued to have
a stronger effect than other variables (OR  11.71, 95% C.I.  2.84,
48.38 in model 1 with men and women, not shown).
Accuracy of Risk Factors for Detecting New Cases of Diabetes. Per-
formance of the risk factors for detecting diabetes in the general
population can be estimated by evaluating decision rules to select
individuals for screening. Performance can be described with the
proportion of diabetes cases that would be detected (hit rate or
true-positive rate) and the proportion of the population that
would need to be screened (e.g., the proportion of the population
with those risk factors). A high true-positive rate (with a
corresponding low false-negative rate) is an important attribute
of a decision rule identifying high-risk individuals for screening
for diabetes, because false-positive errors (resulting in unneces-
sary FPG tests) are less costly than are false-negative errors
(missing cases of diabetes). The goal of using risk factors to
identify individuals for screening is to rule out disease, rather
than a diagnostic role to identify when disease is present. Thus,
a high true-positive rate (sensitivity) and high negative predictive
value are desirable. Predictive value is the Bayesian posterior
probability of disease, given the presence or absence of risk
factors and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (38). Neg-
ative predictive value is the likelihood that someone does not
have diabetes, given that they do not have any risk factors.
Positive predictive value is the likelihood that someone has
diabetes, given that they have risk factors.
The Expert Committee guidelines (1) recommend screening
those who are 45 years of age or older and those with other risk
factors at a younger age. In this study, the screening recommen-
dations were operationalized in the following ways. The first
strategy was equivalent to screening in the presence of at least
one risk factor (including age 45 years as a risk factor),
regardless of age. The true-positive rate or sensitivity for this
strategy is 100.00% (Table 5, rule 1). Negative predictive value
is also 100.00%. Because 83.00% of the adult population has one
or more risk factors, 83.00% would be identified for testing. If
screening at a ``younger age,'' when risk factors are present, were
operationalized instead as screening only those 30 years of age
and older with one other risk factor (rule 2), 70.22% of the
population would be tested with 99.67% sensitivity. Screening, at
any age, when two or more risk factors are present (rule 3) has
sensitivity of 98.30% and would require testing 58.97% of the
population. Limiting screening (in rule 3) to those 30 years of age
and older with any two or more risk factors reduces testing to
53.44% of the population (rule 4).
Simpler rules, such as universal screening for everyone 45
years of age and older (rule 5), results in a sensitivity of 83.97%
and would identify 42.35% of the population for testing. (Note
that the sensitivity of each variable, taken singly, appears in the
second numeric column of Table 2.) However, this rule has
sensitivity of 88.49% for whites, 71.91% for African Americans,
and 47.16% for Mexican Americans because of the earlier age of
onset among minorities (Table 4). If ethnicity were incorporated
into rule 5 by using the age distribution of undiagnosed cases, so
that whites 45 years of age and older, African Americans 35 and
older, Mexican Americans 32 and older, and others 45 and older
(rule 7) were identified for screening; sensitivity would be
equalized for each ethnic group at 88%. A slight simplification
of rule 7 would be to screen whites at 40 years and non-whites
at 30 (rule 8). This simple rule has sensitivity of 95.01% (with
sensitivity 93% within each ethnic group) and 59.84% of the
population would be identified for testing.
Overweight, poor lipid profile (low HDLs or high triglycer-
ides), and gestational diabetes were also identified as strong
predictors of undiagnosed diabetes. Screening for overweight
(rule 9) has sensitivity similar to that of age (rule 5), but not age
and ethnicity (rule 8). Screening for older age within ethnic
groups or overweight (rule 10) is equivalent to screening younger
people if they were overweight. This rule has sensitivity of
100.0% and would identify 77.14% of the population for testing

and performs as well as all risk factors together (rule 1). A poor
lipid profile (rule 11) has a high true-negative rate (83.53%) and
a high negative predictive value (98.20%). Combination of age
and ethnicity with lipid profile would detect almost all cases
(98.45%) and identify 66.07% for FPG testing. Gestational
diabetes has a high true-negative rate (specificity) and although
few people had gestational diabetes, those that have had it were
very likely to have diabetes. Screening based on two or three of
the risk factors, such as age and ethnicity (rule 8); age, ethnicity,
and overweight (rule 10); age, ethnicity, and lipids (rule 12); or
age, ethnicity, and gestational diabetes (rule 14) perform as well
as the entire set of risk factors (rule 1).
Conclusions
Risk factors included in the screening guidelines have a strong
association with diabetes. Having hypertension or a positive family
history of diabetes can double the risk of having diabetes. Age,
obesity, a poor lipid profile, and gestational diabetes, however,
more than double the risk of diabetes. Previous screening guidelines
identified obesity (BMI  27 kgm2) (39) as a risk factor, but it is
clear that risk increases as BMI increases and that being ``over-
weight'' is a significant risk factor without the presence of obesity.
If clinician screening practices followed recommended guidelines
and individuals with one or more risk factors (Table 1) were
screened, then the approximately one-third of diabetes cases that
are undiagnosed would be essentially eliminated.
The strongest risk factors performed as well as all risk factors
together in detecting new cases of diabetes. Age is the risk factor
most strongly associated with the detection of undiagnosed cases
of diabetes, but it does not have a simple cut-point appropriate
for all ethnic groups. Clinical screening strategies focused on
older adults (45 years of age) will miss minorities with diabetes.
The best performance occurs when white patients are screened
beginning at age 40 years and Mexican Americans and African
Americans are screened beginning at age 30 years. This simple
rule would require testing of only 59.84% of the population and
would detect most cases (95%) of diabetes. The 45-year cutoff in
the screening guidelines should be reconsidered, given the risk
to younger minorities.
Identification of risk factors can help guide who should be
screened and may reduce unnecessary testing. An efficient strategy
would rule out disease with a high probability, accurately detect new
cases, and minimize unnecessary testing. Negative predictive value
estimates the probability of classifying individuals as disease-free
and, in this case, its small numerical range (97­100%) indicates that
ruling out disease is possible with most strategies. The difficulty lies
in detecting the small proportion of the general population who
have undiagnosed diabetes.
By focusing on those at highest risk for diabetes, the screening
guidelines can accurately detect new cases and reduce unneces-
sary testing in the general population. If everyone were screened
(100% of the adult population), all undiagnosed diabetes cases
would be detected (sensitivity  100%). If any one of the risk
factors is used to indicate who should be screened, sensitivity is
also 100%, but only 83% of the population would need to be
screened. The presence of two or more risk factors sacrifices a
small amount of sensitivity, doubles the specificity, and further
reduces necessary testing from 83% to 59%. This additional 24%
reduction in testing could have a large impact on the cost of
testing in the United States.
Using risk factors to identify individuals with diabetes has had
mixed results in previous studies primarily because of limited
samples. Nonrepresentative, clinical samples or samples with little
variation in ethnicity or age are not appropriate for generalizing to
the U.S. population. An advantage of using the NHANES data is
that the sample allows for generalization of results to the U.S.
population. Previously, Herman et al. (24) attempted to identify
individuals for screening by using the NHANES II data. The
Herman et al. study, however, did not test the screening guidelines,
and they used an ad hoc (non-maximum likelihood) modeling
technique. They developed four rules combining two or more risk
factors (age, obesity, family history, and sedentary lifestyle) and
correctly identified 79% of ``newly diagnosed'' diabetics. In the
NHANES III data, the current recommended guidelines and
simpler decision rules have detection rates 95%.
The NHANES data set offers a wonderful opportunity to
validate the screening guidelines on a representative U.S. sample
that is sufficiently large to contain adequate numbers of undi-
agnosed diabetics. Conclusions based on the NHANES data,
however, are limited by the set of variables included in the survey
and the accuracy of those variables. One limitation is the reliance
on a single FPG measurement to diagnose diabetes. Although
FPG has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test as the diag-
nostic standard, a clinical diagnosis is confirmed by an additional
test (FPG or oral glucose tolerance test) on a subsequent day (1).
A single FPG would have more classification errors (higher
false-negative rate) than a two-step, two-test method. Even
screening criteria estimated to detect 100% of diabetes cases
would miss some cases because of the false-negative rate of the
diagnostic test. Another limitation is that information is unavail-
able for history of macrosomic infant and dysglycemia. Sensi-
tivity of the available risk factors, however, is so high that
inclusion of additional variables could not appreciably improve
sensitivity, but might increase the number of people identified
for screening. Even without a complete set of risk factors, almost
all cases of diabetes are detected.
The Expert Committee (1) guidelines would detect almost all
cases of diabetes in the general population, if followed. Although
the guidelines have been adopted by several professional soci-
eties, the prevalence of undetected cases of diabetes in the
general population (8) suggests that guidelines are not being
followed. Efficacious guidelines exist, but implementation of the
guidelines remains the greatest challenge.
