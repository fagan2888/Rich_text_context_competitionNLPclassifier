Armenian Church. The Armenian Church in this paper
refers to the Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) Church
founded by St. Gregory the Illuminator in 301 ad.
Deductive approach. In this paper, the deductive approach
refers to the use of the deductive method of reasoning
to move from the general concepts of Armenian lead-
ership models observed throughout history to more
specific hypothetical conclusions on leadership behav-
iors among contemporary Armenian Church, national,
and democratic leaders.
Ethnographic research refers to the study methods of cul-
ture both prehistoric and contemporary through par-
ticipant observations, interviews and/or questionnaires,
conversations, and so on. The emic perspective is used
for data analysis. Emic perspective refers to an anthro-
pological research method that seeks to understand the
culture from within ("through an insider's view") to
help the researcher think and act as a native. Thus, the
aim of emic research is to enable an outsider to gain a
sense of what it means to be an insider.
Historiography. The term historiography in this paper
refers to the historical method of studying the history
through which the historical knowledge is obtained
and transmitted about the history of leadership charac-
teristics, traits, and styles in the context of theArmenian
culture.
Leadership. This refers to both one's leading and follow-
ing behavioral functions in a cross-cultural or multi-
cultural context and time. Leadership is perceived as a
nonstatic human behavioral function: in one situation,
one may follow, in another, lead, and vice versa.
Leadership behavior. This refers to leader's intrapersonal
attitude and interpersonal behavioral response to situ-
ational variables such as leaders and followers in com-
munity and/or organizational context.
This paper addresses major historical leadership models in
Armenia from more than four thousand years of the nation's
history. The historical Armenia was located in Eurasia
between three seas: the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian.
According to available historical sources, Armenians origi-
nate from three people groups: (a) Paeonian people of the
Balkans, (b) the remnants of the Khayashan people, and (c) a
mixture of "Urartians" with indigenous people of the
Armenian highlands with their Indo-European dialect. The
Armenian monarchy lasted from the Bronze Age to the end
of the 14th century ad. After accepting Christianity as a state

Leadership Models in Armenia: Historical
and Contemporary Perspectives
Petros G. Malakyan1
Abstract
This paper addresses historical and contemporary issues of leadership in Armenia. Five leadership models have been
acknowledged in Armenia during its four thousand year history: Monarchic, Church, National, Communist, and Democratic
Leadership. Each model has been presented within its historical context and analyzed in light of current leadership behaviors
in Armenia. The results of the study show that (a) current Armenian leaders seem to reflect the behaviors and attitudes of
the historical leadership models above; (b) history should matter in leadership studies to understand leadership behaviors, in
this case in Armenia, and how the past continues to shape their current worldviews and social identities; and (c) democracy
imported to Armenia from the West, with little considerations of the historical characteristics of the Armenian people,
has not produced the desired democratic reforms since 1991 independence. Perhaps an integrative approach to all five
leadership models is necessary to address leadership challenges in Armenia today.

religion in 301 ad, the Armenians modeled church leadership
that exists today. Beginning in the 16th century, the rise of
Armenian national identity under the yoke of Tatar-Mongols,
Egyptian Mamluks, Turkic tribes, and later, Ottoman sultans
produced a national leadership model in Armenia that aimed
for national independence and struggled against foreign
investors. Due to Socialist movements in Europe and the
Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917, the eastern prov-
inces of Armenia joined the revolutionary movements in
Transcaucasia and--after the newly formed national govern-
ment in Armenia was overthrown in 1920--came to power
as Communist leaders and governed until the collapse of the
Soviet Union. Since 1991, the newly formed government of
independent Armenia has "embraced" Western democracy
and "free-market economy" as the ethos of its constitution.
For the most part, this rapid shift from totalitarian to demo-
cratic form of governance, and from Soviet centralized econ-
omy to free-market economy, was the result of the demand of
the time for political and economic survival rather than peo-
ple's ideological paradigm shift.
Armenia has been in the crossroads of one of the most
intense geopolitical regions of Eurasia since the fall of the
Soviet Union. After more than 20 years of independence,
Armenia continues to be a transitional country with its
massive economic and political problems. Forty-two per-
cent of the country's population lives at or below the pov-
erty level. Due to the severe economic conditions in
Armenia, people are leaving the country to find jobs in
Russia, Europe, and North America. Thus, two thirds of
the Armenian population live outside Armenia. The coun-
try is currently suffering from a high unemployment rate
as well as a lack of accountability among leaders in public
offices and the business sector. During the last presiden-
tial election in 2008, for instance, ballot stuffing, intimi-
dation of poll workers, vote buying, and other irregularities
were not unusual (U.S. Department of State, 2012). Even
the parliamentary election in 2012 was not exempt from
vote buying and ballot stuffing. The corruption continues
to be high among leaders who occupy public offices
(Martirosyan, 2009). A group of oligarchs controls the
entire economy of the country (Masis Post, 2011). The
disheartening reality of Armenia and the Armenian people
raises questions that deserve answers.
It was in 1991, a few months before the fall of the
USSR, when Gerard Libaridian, Professor of Modern
Armenian History at the University of Michigan wrote,
"Will the new leaders of Armenia be able to translate their
vision into a strategy and the strategy into programs? Can
the redefined nation-state succeed where the ideological
empire failed? Can democracy provide what ideology
could not?" (Libaridian, 1991, pp. 7-8). After more than
20 years of Armenian independence and so-called demo-
cratic government, I feel compelled to ask similar ques-
tions about the leaders of Armenia. Why has Western
democracy not been working? Will it ever work? If not,
what type of democracy or form of governance is more
culturally relevant to the Armenian people? Can we learn
useful leadership lessons from the nation's history to help
us face the 21st century's economic, political, social, cul-
tural, and global challenges? Finally, what is the future of
Armenian leadership?
To find answers to these questions, I have taken on the
task of studying Armenian leaders and leadership models,
from prehistoric times to the present expecting to attain new
perspectives and answers to the aforementioned questions
for the 21st-century Armenian leadership.
Purpose
The purpose of this study is to assess five major historical
and contemporary models of indigenous Armenian leader-
ship to be able to understand the relationship between the
past and present, and whether or not the current leadership
behaviors are the product of the nation's history.
Objectives
The research objectives are to understand current Armenian
leadership in light of five major historical and contempo-
rary leadership models: Monarchy (2500 bc-1375 ad),
Church leadership (301 ad-present), National leadership
(1675-present), Communist leadership (1920-1990),
National leadership (1988-present), and Democratic leader-
ship (1991-present).
Method
By using the historiographical and ethnographic research
(participant observation: emic perspective) methods, this
paper follows the deductive reasoning around the following
hypothesis: history matters in leadership studies. One may
observe historical leadership models to understand their
influence on leaders'and/or followers'present behaviors and
perhaps foresee upcoming challenges and how to respond to
those challenges.
Research Questions
Research Question 1: What are the Armenian leadership
models in Armenia observed throughout history?
Research Question 2: What are the relationships between
currentArmenian leadership behaviors and the nation's
leadership history?
Research Question 3: What leadership lessons can be
learned from the history of Armenia to face the 21st
century's economic, political, social, cultural, and
global challenges?
Research Question 4: What is the future of Armenian
leadership having in mind the leadership models of the
past and present?

Research Design
and Conceptual Framework
To gain new knowledge and perspectives about Armenian
leadership of the past and present, I have chosen historiogra-
phy to search historical data collections for Armenian leader-
ship themes.
First, I have used key historical sources to identify various
leadership traits that existed in Armenia from its beginning.
Armenian and non-Armenian sources are used to collect the
necessary data for leadership analysis. I have identified lead-
ership traits within the nation's history and categorized them
under the following major historical leadership themes:
Armenian monarchy,Armenian Church leadership,Armenian
national leadership, Armenian Communist leadership, and
Armenian democratic leadership. Then I sought to acknowl-
edge the above themes' unique contributions to and influ-
ences on the development of the Armenian worldview and
perception of leadership (whom the leaders were and what
the society's expectations were) throughout generations.
Second, I have observed the above historical leadership
themes in light of current Armenian leadership by using the
emic perspective of my own 35 years of experience as a
native Armenian and an insider to the Armenian culture, as
well as an expatriate, an outsider to the Armenian culture
through ongoing visits, interactions, and observations.
Delimitation
This study is limited to observe Armenian public leaders both
historical and contemporary within five historical leadership
models: monarchic, Church, national, Communist, and demo-
cratic in the context of historicalArmenia and current Republic
of Armenia. Other leadership models among Armenians in the
Armenian Diaspora is beyond the scope of this study.
Findings
What have been the main traits and characteristics of
Armenian leadership in Armenia? To be able to answer this
question, it is necessary to hear what the Armenian historiog-
raphy has to say about Armenians. In light of the historio-
graphical data, five major Armenian leadership themes have
been identified: Monarchy (2500 bc-1375 ad), Church
Leadership (301 ad-present), National Leadership
(1675-present), Communist Leadership (1920-1990), and
Democratic Leadership (1991-present).
Armenian Monarchy (2500 bc-1375 ad)
The first and the longest historical trait of Armenian leader-
ship that had a lasting impact on the development of preser-
vation of the Armenian people are the Armenian monarchy.
According to Moses Khorenats'i, the father of the Armenian
historiography (padmahayr), Haic or Hayk marks the
beginning of the Armenian monarchy around and beyond the
shores of Mount Ararat (Transcaucasia) in 1779 according to
the Jewish calendar or the Septuagint 2663 (Chamchyants,
2005; Khorenats'i, 1978; Soultanian, 2003).
From the Haykazuni Dynasty of the Bronze Age
(2492/2107 bc) until the Lusinian Dynasty of Modern Era
(1375) nearly 88 monarchs ruled Armenia known as Great
Armenia, Lesser Armenia, and the Armenian Kingdom of
Cilicia (Chamchyants, 2005).1 The Armenian historical lead-
ership has primarily been monarchical through the family
lines beginning the Haykazuni dynasty of the Bronze Age
(2500 bc) to the last dynasty of the Armenian kingdom,
Lusinians of Cilicia, the 14th century ad (Der Nersessian,
1969). During the above period, nearly four millennia, seven
pan-Armenian dynasties ruled Armenia: Haykazuni dynasty,
Urartu dynasty, Ervanduni dynasty, Artashesian dynasty,
Arshakuni dynasty, Bagratuni dynasty, and Rubenian-
Hetumian-Lusignan dynasties of Cilicia (Bournoutian, 2005;
Burney & Lang, 1972; Lang, 1980; Douglas, 1992; Redgate,
1998; Zimansky, 1998).
The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia under the rules of
Rubinian, Hetumian, and Lusinian dynasties from 1075 to
1375 ad marks the end of the Armenian Monarchy. This
period has been the longest period in the history of the
nation where monarchic-autocratic style of leadership was
dominant and decisive for the nation's survival. From the
middle of the seventh to the end of twelfth century, Arabs
conquered the Armenian land and devastated cities and vil-
lages (Ghevond, 1982).
After the fall of the Cilician Kingdom, the next five centu-
ries until the beginning of the 19th century, the Armenian
urban civilization transformed into a rural existence and the
country turned into a state anarchy until mid-18th century.
After the collapse of Seljuk power in 1300s, Turkomen
nomads gain power in Asia Minor and western part of histori-
cal Armenia under the rule of Osman. The latter's followers,
the Osmanlees or Ottomans, later founded the largest and
most enduring empire in the history of Islam called Ottoman
Empire. This marked the beginning of a dark age for the
Armenian remnant in the west. In the eastern part ofArmenia,
Armenians fell under the Persian rule in 1603 and later under
the rules of Russian Czars in 1829. Thus, Armenians from the
majority population became a minority group ever since the
Seljuk Turks conquered Armenia, followed by rules of Young
Turks from the west and Persians and Russians from the east.
Later Armenians struggled for individual and ethnic survival
during the Armenian genocides that took place from 1894 to
1923 under three Turkish authorities: Ottoman Empire,Young
Turks, and the current Republic of Turkey (Howard, 2001;
Kinzer, 2001; Nyrop, 1980).
Armenian Church Leadership (301 ad-Present)
The second major leadership trait among Armenians
observed in this paper is the Armenian Church leadership.
4 SAGE Open
The only existing institution that traces back to the 4th cen-
tury is theArmenianApostolic Church. Not any other institu-
tion survived since those days, including kingdoms and
dynasties. Thus, the Armenian Church, with its unique lead-
ership traits and characteristics, has a significant influence
on the life of the Armenian people even today.
The Armenian conversion from paganism to Christianity
as a state religion in 301 ad marks the birth of the Armenian
Church and its patriarchal and hierarchical leadership in
Armenia. Gregory the Illuminator, according to
Agathangelos's account, was the founder of Christianity in
Armenia, which became the first Christian state in the world
(Thomson, & Howard-Johnson, 1999).2 Frend (1972) asserts,
"the official conversion of the [Armenian] kingdom had
taken place `from above,' that is through the conversion of
the ruling dynasty and an influential part of the aristocracy"
(p. 309).3
With an objective look into Khorenats'i's History of the
Armenians, one may easily observe a top-down
Christianization of Armenia by the royal order of Kings
Trdat, which is not seen in Agathangelos's History. Some
pagans Armenians apparently were forced to accept
Christianity. Interestingly enough, the pagan resistance to
Christian faith and the further presence of paganism in
Armenia in the early stages of Armenian Christianity has
been confirmed in Pawstos's (1989) History. According to
Ormanian's chronological chart, which begins in 302 ad and
ends in 1911, there were 127 Patriarchs, out of which only 6
were from the Gregorian family line (Ormanian, 1912).
Eppler (1873) identifies seven levels of clergy in theArmenian
Orthodox Church: doorkeepers, readers of the liturgical
materials or the Scripture, exorcists, carriers of the torch, the
lower deacons, the archdeacons, and the priesthood--bishops,
archbishops, patriarchs, and the Catholicos, who oversee all
Armenian Orthodox Churches in the world. Ormanian
(1955), however, lists four degrees of hierarchy: (a) the
supreme Patriarch or Catholicos; (b) the Patriarch or special
Catholicos, exert, or primate; (c) the archbishop or metro-
politan; and (d) the bishop. The latter asserts the traditional
participatory role of ordinary people in doctrinal, discipline,
as well as ecclesiastical election matters within the Armenian
Church that dates back to the earliest periods of its existence.
For instance, from electing the local parish priests to the
Catholicos, the supreme patriarch of the Armenian Church,
lay members, comprising princes, satraps, deputies, and rep-
resentatives of people, cast the majority votes (Ormanian,
1955). He goes on to say that, "of all Christian communities,
the Armenian Church is the one wherein the democratic
spirit excels in all its vividness and truth" and that the pres-
ence of the laity is justified in the ecclesiastical assemblies
and councils (pp. 136-137).
Education and literacy occupy a central place in the lives
of Armenian Church leaders. Beginning from the Golden Age
of the Armenian era (5th century ad) to the middle of the 20th
century, the Communist era, most historians, philosophers,
theologians, and scientists were either Catholicoses, bishops,
or vartabets (celibate priests) of the Armenian Church
(Kurkjian, 1964; Nersoyan, 1963).
The Armenian Church functioned both as a government
as well as a religious institution not only before the last
Armenian kingdom of Cilicia but also after its fall in the later
14th century. As a result, the Church has taken the role of a
government to preserve tradition and national identity, some-
times at the expense of spiritual and moral guidance
(Libaridian, 1999, p. 126).
With the rise of political independence in 1918-1920 and
subsequently communism in 1920-1990, the Armenian
Church was weakened due to massive persecutions of clergy
and church abolishment. During the Soviet reign, a new cat-
egory of Armenians emerged--atheists, who were anti-
Christian socialists. The first decade of the Soviet regime
marked (a) the ideological battle against the Church via the
apparatus of the militant atheism to diminish the image and
the authority of the Church among the Armenian people and
(b) the physical destruction and annihilation of ancient
Armenian churches, monasteries, and Christian literature.
The forceful separation of the state and the church affected
all levels of Armenia's social life: ideological, educational,
cultural, economic, and political.
The post-Communist period since the 1991 independence
began with the rise of the Armenian Church's authority and a
total ignorance on the part of government leaders concerning
Christianity in Armenia. This sudden freedom and ideologi-
cal vacuum as a result of the fall of the Communist regime
has created enormous anxiety and confusion among both
religious and secular leaders.
Armenian National Leadership (1675-Present)
The third leadership trait among Armenians examined in this
paper is the national leadership. National leaders have his-
torically held an important place in the development of
Armenian ideology of leadership. Leaders in legendary lit-
erature, political-military leaders, writers and poets, and
national heroes whose primary goal was national indepen-
dence and the freedom of the motherland from foreign domi-
nators have all influenced Armenian life.
As a result of two and a half centuries of war between
Ottoman and Persian Empires (1473-1746), Russia and
Turkey (1768-1918) including the Armenian genocide in
Turkey (1895-1915), and later the Russian regime inArmenia
before and after the Bolshevik Revolution, left Armenia with
few Armenians. The remnants of the Armenian people sur-
vived primarily outside of the historic Armenia (Nersisian,
1972). The people and its leadership in exile formed a new
model of leadership: national leadership of Diaspora around
various nationalistic parties and religious communities
(Aghayan, 1976).
Armenian literature has been one of the most effective
tools for the development of ideal national leadership in the
Malakyan 5
Armenian mind, whom the leaders are and what makes one
an exemplary leader (Raffi, 1955). Patriotism and national-
ism have become milestones within the diverse literature
genre, epic stories, legends, ancient mythology, biographical
writings, and so on. One of the earliest and prominent leg-
endary heroes was Hayk, the forefather of the Armenians,
whose courage and fearless battle against Bell's outnum-
bered and powerful army brought a great victory and free-
dom to Hayk's family from his most threatening enemy.
Thus, throughout the centuries, Armenians, always in the
minority, continued to believe that the numerical superiority
of an enemy in battle did not guarantee victory. Another
example is the Avarair or Vardanank War in 451 ad--Arme-
nians resisted the Persian king Hazkert's (Yazdgird II) force-
ful conversion from Christianity to Zoroastrianism (Elishe,
1982; Parpetsi, 1985). After the Council of Chalcedon, due
to church doctrinal and political reasons, Armenia was
divided into Byzantine and Persian Armenia.
Novelists and poets such as Raffi (Hagop Melik-
Hagopian), Hovhannes Toomanian, Derenik Demirjian,
Khachatour Abovian, Mikael Nalbandian, Rafael Patkanian,
Berj Proshiants, Daniel Varoujan, Hagop Paronian, Vahan
Terian, Mouratsan, Nar-Dos, Avetik Isahakyan, Yeghishe
Charents, Aksel Bakounts, Vahan Totovents, Parouyr Sevag,
Silva Kaputikian, Hovhannes Shiraz, and others have signifi-
cantly impacted the new generation of Armenians of the late-
19th and the 20th centuries. While Russian and Georgian
intellectuals and revolutionaries followed German philo-
sophical ideas of socialism, Armenians adopted a more
nationalistic course. Eastern Armenian writers and poets fol-
lowed the romanticism of the Western writers by magnifying
ideas of patriotism, justice, and freedom among Armenians.
Like their counterparts in the Balkans, Poland, and Bohemia,
they too embraced the concept of rebellion and resistance to
foreign dominations (Bournoutian, 1994).
The history of the 19th-century Eastern Armenia marks a
colonial period in which Armenia was under Russian and
Iranian domination without national sovereignty. During that
period, Armenia did not exist geographically on the global
map. The entire Transcaucasus was considered a part of
Southern Russia. As a result of World War I and the two
Russian revolutions (1905-1907 and 1917), major political
and territorial changes took place in Armenia. First, in April
1918, a federative republic, independent from Russia called
the Transcaucasian Federative Republic, was formed by
Georgians, Armenians, and Azeries. Second, a month later,
in May 1918, the first Republic of Armenia was formed. It
can be said that the founders of the first Republic of Armenia
were representatives of national leaders on behalf of the
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Hai Heghapokhagan
Dashnaktsutiun). The latter lasted about a thousand days
until the Communist Bolsheviks took over the government in
1921 (Bournoutian, 1994) by forming the so-called second
republic: Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the
period of the first Armenian massacres in Turkey in 1895 to
the fall of the first Armenian republic in 1921, a number of
volunteer military commanders and warrior-groups led by
popular commanders such as Andranik (Terzibashian, 1942;
Mnatsakanian & Hogopian, 1991), Dro (Gevorgian, 1991),
Garegin Njdeh (Bournoutian, 1994), and independent war-
riors called fidayies--Arabo, Mgo Shahen, Gevorg Chaush,
Agbiur Serob, Hagop Sargavag (deacon), Hrair, Smbat,
Mourad, and others--rose to protect their own country and
fight for national independence. The lives and heroic acts of
these people were recounted as sources of inspiration for the
Armenian people for many generations. Many stories, songs,
and novels have been written about them.
Armenian Communist Leadership (1921-1991)
The third noteworthy Armenian leadership trait is found in
the era of Communist regime in Armenia from 1921 to 1991.
The first seeds of Marxist ideology in Armenia were planted
in the 1880s. Armenian students in Europe first attempted to
translate The Communist Manifesto in 1887. By the end of
the 19th century, Armenians had already published the works
of Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and other Communist prop-
agates in Armenian. In the beginning of the 20th century,
some Armenian revolutionary Marxists, such as Bogdan
Knouniants (1878-1911) and Stepan Shahoumian (1878-
1918), participated in the formation of a new type of Marxist
party in Russia. They became close partners of Vladimir I.
Lenin.
Communist leadership in the former Soviet Union, and
particularly in Armenia, was grounded on the materialistic
ideology of Marxism­Leninism. The theory of historical and
dialectical materialism developed by Marx and Engels advo-
cates the notion of maintaining the physical existence of
human beings as biological species (Christensen, 1994), and
the production and reproduction of the means of subsistence
as a foundation for communal life. Communist leaders called
for liberation of the masses from existing social injustices
and inequalities and advocated for common ownership and
control over the resources and production. The expected out-
come believed to be a just and communal society. However,
the Marxist theory of class struggle for social justice in
Armenia, as well as in other Communist countries, fell short
in its practical implementation.
Moreover, Marxist philosophical anthropology, namely,
the view of moral character, is another significant issue. It
was expected that human class-consciousness create willing-
ness to strive for a better world and to bring social change or
progress to society. Subsequently, according to Marxist­
Leninist theory, the rise and the development of morality
must be contingent upon the rise and the development of the
social consciousness (De George, 1969).
Collectivity of leadership was the highest principle of the
Communist Party in the former Soviet Union, including in
Armenia. Lenin held that a collective form of leadership was
a critical criterion for Party functioning. Lenin felt that such
6 SAGE Open
a form would safeguard the Party from one-sidedness in
decision making. Yet, the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union soon after Lenin's death fell short from its own core
leadership principle of collectivity. Stalin came to power and
imposed himself as the final and ultimate power source for
the Party. Although the "cult of the individual personality"
was condemned after Stalin's death (Christensen, 1994),4 his
leadership led the country into a tyranny and annihilation of
innocent lives in Armenia and in other socialist republics
within the former Soviet Union.
The first Bolshevik revolutionists became the ideal lead-
ers or role models for their contemporaries and for the next
generation. As a result of this new style of leadership, some
were inspired by these ideas from childhood. Others who
were more advanced in years adopted a method of self-
enforcement for change (Mead, 1955). Mead also observed
three behavioral patterns in Bolshevik leadership: (a)
behavior that is traditional and pre-Soviet, (b) a behavior
adopted in adulthood through self-enforcement, and (c)
new Soviet behavior that is grounded in childhood through
discipline and education. From the beginning of the
Communist era, the Soviet authorities trained their cadres
in the Communist ideal personality. This new indoctrina-
tion created an ideological tension between the traditional
Armenian Christian faith and the faith in communism and
for its cause. On one hand, for a Christian, the concept of
good and bad has been categorized by Christian scriptures,
on the other hand, for a Communist, it is the Party that is
authorized to define good and bad for the society. For a
Christian, one may either transgress or obey the given prin-
ciples, while for a Communist, it is the capacity to maintain
"disallowed attitudes" and openness for self-criticism and
group-criticism. Moreover, in Christian behavior, there is
to be no hatred toward enemies, Communist leadership left
no room for love toward the Party's enemies such as traitors
and spies, while trying to instill love toward the Party and
the country (Mead, 1955).
Thus, mistrust among people was one of the reasons that
millions of innocent people, including committed Communist
leaders, were executed and/or imprisoned under the common
epithet "enemy of the people" during the Stalin reign of
1930s and 1940s. All the early Armenian Marxist-
revolutionists died at an early age. Their opponents or ene-
mies under various circumstances executed them. Thus, in
later Communist literature, these people were heroes of the
time. They became role models for generations to come.
Therefore, not surprisingly, hundreds of thousands of young
men and women gave their lives for their country and for
Soviet society during World War II, and some granted the
title of National Hero. They continued to live in literature,
films, and on the lips of students at all levels of education.
The Soviet authorities carefully designed school programs so
that the above ideal leaders would inspire and shape the new
generation with patriotic fervor and ideals.
Armenian Democratic Leadership (1991-Present)
The fifth and the youngest Armenian leadership model is the
democratic leadership. In August 1990, for the first time in
the history of the nation, the newly formed Armenian
Parliament officially declared independence from the Soviet
Union and voted for its first democratically elected President,
Levon Ter-Petrosyan (Libaridian, 1991). Today, the Republic
of Armenia has her third elected President. However, accord-
ing to the international and local observers of elections, the
second and third presidential elections fell short from the
international standards of fair and democratic elections.
Incidents such as selling votes, electoral frauds, and the use
of brutal force by police or military were not exempted from
all three preceding elections from 1996 to 2008. It is true that
people of Armenia made a conscious choice in moving from
totalitarian hierarchy to independent democracy in 1990.
However, it is hard to argue for a democratic worldview fully
embraced by the society and its leaders. Rather, democracy
seems another imposed ideology, much like Communism for
70 years. Under democracy, the so-called democratic leaders
in Armenia live and act like monarchs. For instance, in less
than a decade, a new generation of millionaires and billion-
aires emerged in Armenia. The lifestyle of these newly
emerged "kings" is a reminder of ancient Armenian monar-
chic rulers with their luxurious palaces, fancy transportation
means, expensive and wasteful food parties and weddings,
and numerous house-servants. However, according to the
report of the Armenian government, 34.6% of Armenia's
population lived below the poverty line in 2004, 23.5% in
2008, and 28.7% in 2009 by falling back to the level of
2005-2006.5
During Ter-Petrosyan's presidency, the middle class,
once representing the majority of the Armenian population
during the Soviet regime, disappeared partly because of the
collapse of the Soviet centralized economy and the eco-
nomic blockades by Turkey and Azerbaijan over the territo-
rial dispute of the Nagorno-Karabakh since 1991. Moreover,
the 1988 earthquake that devastated and destroyed cities
and hundreds of villages, by taking away more than twenty-
five thousand lives, created massive homelessness, poverty,
and economic dependency on foreign aid. Although the
1995 Constitution insured peaceful transition of power
between various political parties, fundamental differences
arose between the governing elite and as a result, a consen-
sus was not reached and the first president resigned in 1998
(Libaridian, 2007).
During the Kocharian administration (1998-2007) the dis-
pute with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh remained
unresolved. According to Libaridian (2007), although
Armenia joined the Council of Europe and the World Trade
Organization, the former became weary of the progress of
democracy in Armenia, while the latter limited benefits to
Armenia due to its economic situation.
Malakyan 7
Thus, it can be said that the democratic leadership in
Armenia inherited all of the above leadership models: monar-
chic authoritarianism, Christian hierarchy, Communist total-
itarianism, and patriotic nationalism. The situation is
complex and there seem to be no single strategy to have all at
once, "an independent Armenia that is also free and demo-
cratic,richandwithoutcorruptionanddepravity"(Libaridian,
1999, pp. 156-157). Thus, the question to be addressed in
further research is, "What it means to be a democratic leader
in the context of the Armenian historical worldview embed-
ded in the cultural habits of the Armenian people?"
Discussion
What do the above historical and contemporary leadership
models teach us and what are the implications of those les-
sons for the country's 21st-century economic, political,
social, cultural, and global challenges? To be able to answer
these questions, let us highlight some historical facts and les-
sons learned from each model to be able to understand the
current leadership behaviors in Armenia.
Armenian Monarchy
1. For four millennia, the Armenian leadership has pri-
marily been monarchical through seven pan-Armenian
family lines beginning the Bronze Age (2500 bc) to the
14th century ad.
Implications: One may easily observe the monarchic
behaviors of current leaders inArmenia. For instance, today's
most public leaders inArmenia, much like monarchs, appoint
their family members, relatives, and close friends to various
leadership positions in both public and private sectors.
Leadership successions have been perceived and practiced in
Armenia as family successions. The country being small,
both geographically and population-wise, it is nearly impos-
sible to avoid favoritism in hiring processes for public
offices. Thus, those who know each other treat one another
with special favor.
2. Monarchic-autocratic style of leadership was dominant
and decisive for this period.
Implications: As mentioned earlier, current leaders in
Armenia act and behave as ancient kings. Many of them
carry the names of Armenian Kings (e.g., Hayk, Tigran,
Arshak, Gagik, Ashot, Yervand, Bagrad, etc.). They are as
autocratic and authoritarian as their assenters were during the
monarchic era. Some leaders feel entitled to exercise unlim-
ited authority and freedom in decision making with little, if
any, accountability toward others. Today's public leaders
possess extreme wealth and lead a lavish, luxury, and royal-
type lifestyles.
3. After the fall of the Cilician Kingdom in the 14th cen-
tury, Armenians lost their independence and for the
next five centuries, until the beginning of the 19th cen-
tury, they lived and survived under foreign regimes:
Ottoman, current Turkish, Russian, and the former
Soviet Union.
Implications: A significant number of Armenians today
believe that Armenia will not survive without foreign pow-
ers. This mind-set of dependency seems to be the product of
the nation's survival history under foreign oppressors in the
last 600 years. For instance, although the country regained its
independence in 1991, today's Armenia is politically and
economically dependent on Russia's strong military pres-
ence in Armenia and the economic investments of the
Western world.
Armenian Church Leadership
1. Leadership from top-down. The Armenian Church
leadership has been top-down since its beginning. The
newly converted King Trtad invited St. Gregory the
Illuminator to become the first Catholicos or Supreme
Patriarch in the beginning of the 4th century. Thus, this
era marks the beginning of Church-and-State relations
and its impact on the development of hierarchical lead-
ership in the Armenian Church.
Implications: The Armenian Church today seeks the
State's participation and support to carry out its mission in
the society, much like in the time of the King Trtad.
2. Leadership from bottom-up. Despite the fact that the
Church leadership was primarily hierarchical and male
dominated, the Church was able to mobilize clergy and
laity for church administration, education and enlight-
enment of the nation, and preservation of theArmenian
church tradition, language, culture, and faith from
early-5th century until today.
Implications: Despite the fact that the church leadership
continues to be predominately hierarchical and paternalistic,
the relationships between clergy and laity have often been
perceived as collaborative. For instance, the laity is given
authority in church governance, and elections of the church
leaders. Thus, the church continues to maintain and exercise
spiritual authority among the Armenian people, be the van-
guard for human development and education, and remain the
most powerful institution called for the preservation of
Christian and cultural identity of the Armenian people.
3. From late-14th until early-20th centuries, the Armenian
Church played dual leadership roles, spiritual and
political, in the life of the Armenian people.
8 SAGE Open
Implications: The church leadership continues to see its
dual role in the society, which often causes confusion and
tension between civil and spiritual authorities.
Constitutionally, the Church and State are separated.
However, since the independence, both clergy and laity see
the role of the Armenian Church to be important not only in
spiritual but also in political life of the nation. Moreover, the
Armenian Church feels entitled to occupy a special role in
the life of the nation among other Christian denominations in
Armenia.
4. Leadership of powerlessness and persecution. As a
result of Soviet persecution, many clergymen lost their
lives. Thousands of churches and Christian communi-
ties were destroyed in both cities and villages.
Implications: The Communist era fundamentally changed
the role and the image of the Church leadership among ordi-
nary people.Anew generation of atheistArmenians emerged,
who devalued the Armenian Church's spiritual role in soci-
ety. These spiritual leaders were prohibited to provide spiri-
tual nurturing and Christian education to their flock.
However, a new generation of clergymen emerged in the
Church as compromisers with the Soviet government and
KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvenniy Bezopasnosti [Committee
of Government Security]). This generation of clergymen still
exists in the church.
5. Leadership of transition and confusion. Since the 1991
independence, the Armenian Church has been in transi-
tion. The Church and the society still struggle in
redefining the Church's role in today's society.
Constitutionally, the Church is separated from the State.
Implications: On one hand, the Church is eager to restore
its 4th-century role of Church­State partnership; on the other
hand, it continues to face opposition from its own secular-
ized and post-Soviet society as well as the secular state of the
Republic of Armenia. Another key player for Church­State
separation is the European Union (EU), which sets the latter
as criteria for Armenia's membership with EU. As a result,
the tensions are being escalated between the newly formed
democratic institutions and the centuries-old Armenian
Church, the preserver of the Armenian identity, culture, and
people.
Armenian National Leadership
1. The Armenian people, in both western and eastern
Armenia, have invested profound trust and hope in
national leaders to obtain freedom and independence.
The military commanders and those who dedicated
their lives for the freedom of Armenians have become
national heroes and exemplary leaders for the
Armenian people. The Armenian nationalist sentiment
of early-20th century advocated political freedom
through violent resistance. This notion carried through
the Soviet era and found support with current
Armenian national leaders' understanding of justice
and freedom for the Armenian people. This notion is
still strong among national leaders who are in power
in Armenia today.
Implications: It was during the period of post­World War
I revolutions when the Armenian society was most secular-
ized. Some turned their back to the Church and Christianity
by advocating for violent and armed revolt against the
nation's enemies. This anti-Christian propaganda provided a
fertile soil for Communist ideology to prosper in Armenia in
early-20th century. Later, as seen in history, the Bolsheviks
were able to overthrow the first Armenian Republic in 1920.
Interestingly enough, unlike the above period, the national
leaders in cooperation with the Armenian Church leaders
were able to mobilize Armenians in Armenia and around the
world to defend Nagorno-Karabakh, a newly declared and
independent state from the Soviet Socialist Azerbaijan in late
1980s and early 1990s.
2. As seen above, the Armenian literature has shaped the
national identity of Armenians and fueled energy for
the formation of national leadership in Armenia for
years. Epic heroes and legends created exemplary
images and ethos for national leadership for more than
a hundred years. Writers of the 19th and 20th centuries,
by using historical incidents, produced patriotic and
ideal leadership models for generations to follow.
Their utmost expression was found in the stories and
lives of national-military leaders. In the midst of the
struggle for independence and the loss of national sov-
ereignty, national leaders provided hope for the future.
The fact that national patriots did not spare their lives
for the independence of Armenia has had a tremendous
moral impact on the Armenian people. These patriots
felt responsible for protecting their homes, villages,
cities, and the entire country from enemies at the cost
of their own lives.
Implications: The national leadership with its patriotism,
social responsibility, and love of one's own people and the
country, continues to influence masses and exercise moral
authority in Armenia today.
Communist Leadership
1. To the disappointment of many Soviet Communists,
beginning from the early stage until Gorbachev's
Perestroika in late 1980s, Marxist predictions for a
rich, prosperous, and just society just did not realize.
This led to ideological, economic, and political vac-
uum and later--corruption.
Malakyan 9
Implications: As a result of the deterioration of the Soviet
ideology, people resisted following Communist leaders, who
themselves were not ideal models for a society of justice and
equality.
2.Armenian women played a significant role in Communist
society more than ever in the history of the nation.
Ironically, Communists were less discriminatory against
women than was the Christian Church in Armenia.
Women in the Soviet society were encouraged to receive
education and take leadership roles. Twelve percent of
Communist leaders in the former Soviet Union were
females and Armenia was not an exception.
Implications: The Communist era produced a significant
number of educated, professional, and self-reliant women in
the Armenian society, who later became political as well as
organizational leaders for the Republic of Armenia.
Democratic Leadership
1. The democratic leaders in Armenia, who were both for-
mer Communist leaders or Party members and national
leaders started well in early 1990s but soon became
corrupt due to lack of accountability and moral charac-
ter. Within few years, a newly emerged millionaires
formed oligarchy took control of the country's entire
economy and political life.
Implications: Armenia became one of the poorest coun-
tries in the world with more than 40% poverty and below the
poverty rate. Millions of Armenians have left the country
from late 1990 until today for physical and economic sur-
vival. The middle class, once formed during the Soviet era,
disappeared and the gap between rich and poor increased
significantly.
2. As mentioned above, most election results were either
falsified, bought, or imposed on ordinary citizens.
People, due to their financial needs, were seduced to
selling their votes openly to politicians who offered
monetary rewards.
Implications: Due to voting frauds, selling votes, and
stuffing, people not only lost faith in elections and the demo-
cratic processes of governance but also became corrupt
themselves by participating in those immoral behaviors.
Result
The historical data and the contemporary situation of
Armenia's public leadership behavior indicate the following
relationships that continue to exist between currentArmenian
leadership behaviors and the nation's historical models of
leadership:
·
· Millennia-long monarchic mind-set is still present in
the memories and behaviors of those who occupy
leadership positions in Armenia. Most males not only
carry the names of ancient Armenian kings but also
their lifestyle and leadership styles.
·
· Armenian Church Leadership is a contemporary with
it hierarchical structure and mind-set. The same hier-
archical subordination is present in the society
between leaders and followers, male and female, and
in other community and organizational relationships.
Moreover, the Armenian Church continues to be the
role of spiritual hegemony for the Armenian people.
People submit to the authority of the Church and
respect their leaders. Thus, the Armenian Church's
impact on the Armenian society and its historical leg-
acy, including its influence on today's political pro-
cesses, cannot be minimized or ignored.
·
· National Leadership. The Armenian literature, both
pre-Christian and post-Christian eras, continues to
inspire and shape the Armenian worldview. Patriotic
writers of the 19th- and 20th-centuriesArmenia, includ-
ing scientists, artists, and national and church heroes
occupy the pages of Armenia's history and educational
textbooks from elementary to high school, and from
college to university education. One of the brightest
evidence of this is the Armenian currency, the dram.
The pictures on 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 drams
bills are the faces of Yeghishe Charents (poet),
Hovhannes Toumanyan (poet-writer),Avetik Isahakyan
(poet-writer), and Martiros Saryan (painter). Moreover,
most streets and towns are names after national war-
riors, poets, writers, artists, church leaders, and political
leaders who fought for the nation's independence.
These leaders were not necessarily democratic leaders
in its Western understanding.
·
· Although the Communist leadership externally dis-
appeared, internally it continues to exist. Today's
most political leaders are the product of the Soviet
society. They have been trained and educated during
the Soviet era and most of them have seen only
Soviet style of leadership. These leaders lacked
alternative models of leading, managing, and gov-
erning. In fact, some Communist leaders or the
Party members, right after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, were transformed into democratic leaders
overnight. For instance, number of cabinet members
of the first President of Armenia, Levon Ter-
Petrosyan, and members of the first Armenian
Parliament, were either former Communist leaders
or members of the Communist Party. Thus, those of
us who grew up during the Soviet era see no differ-
ence between Communist leadership styles and cur-
rent democratic leadership styles. The names seem
to have changed but leaders' behaviors and world-
views remained the same.
10 SAGE Open
·
· Armenian Democratic Leadership. The Western dem-
ocratic form of governance seems foreign to today's
Armenian leaders. It has been more than 20 years
since the democratization process began in Armenia;
however, it did not produce the expected results,
despite the fact that all the necessary democratic insti-
tutions, laws, and governing policies were created by
the support of Western powers and foreign investors.
In other words, the existing democratic system has not
been working well for the people of Armenia. As
mentioned above, most presidential and parliamen-
tary elections have been handled undemocratically
both by the voters and candidates. Instead, the so-
called democratic leaders in Armenia demonstrate
monarchic behaviors through their autocratic style of
leadership and wasteful lifestyles. Finally, despite the
fact that the country continues to struggle with high
unemployment rate and extreme poverty, the demo-
cratic leaders who are in power continue to become
richer more than the Communist leaders at times. The
leaderships of the Republic of Armenia seem more
corrupt than the Communist leaders in the former
Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia.
Conclusion
Out of five leadership models, three are visible today:
Church, National, and Democratic leadership. However, the
other two, Monarchic and Communist, continue to exist
invisibly in the memories as well as in the behaviors of
Armenian leaders today. Thus, it can be said that the past
leadership models are very present in Armenia both visibly
and invisibly.
This study shows that the indigenous leadership history of
Armenia has significantly impacted leaders' behaviors. For
instance, as a result of enduring under oppressive rules in the
last 600 years, today's leaders seem dependent on foreign aid
and lack confidence in the nation's ability to maintain
national independence. Thus, it can be said that history
should matter in leadership studies and that human behaviors
are the product of one's past experiences that shape people's
personal as well as social identities.
This study also shows that democracy cannot be exported
from the West or imported to Armenia without considering
the historical characteristics of the Armenian people. Thus,
the democratic mind-set must be present in people's world-
view in the first place before anticipating any behavioral,
social or organizational change, in this case in Armenia.
Moreover, the presence of democratic institutions seems
insufficient to bring about the desired change. The fact that
democratic laws and policies that have existed in Armenia
for nearly two decades have not sufficiently democratized
the country is evidence of the Western failed attempts.
It is evident from the study that one leadership model has
not been sufficient to fully address the leadership challenges
in Armenia. Perhaps the integration of all five leadership
models may offer some solutions to the leadership problems
that exist in Armenia today.
Recommendation for Further Research
This study has its limitations, which makes difficult to rec-
ommend solutions to the discussed leadership problems in
Armenia. There seem to be other variables in the leadership
context of Armenia that deserve attention and further study.
For instance, the Armenian cultural worldview cannot be
ignored, because it shapes the leaders' identity and influ-
ences their behavior and leadership style. Thus, there seem to
be a need for further research and study about Armenian
leadership behavior in light of leadership styles and cultural
characteristics to be able to gain anthropological understand-
ing of why leaders in the Armenian cultural context behave
the way they behave. Therefore, to address the leadership
issues in Armenia holistically, one may acquire further
knowledge in the areas of cultural characteristics and leader-
ship styles.

Notes
1. Sources that acknowledge other kingdoms in Armenia such
as Ani, Vaspurakan, Kars, and Syunik are beyond the purpose
and the scope of this study. The goal was not to present an
exhaustive list of all Armenian kings and princes through ages,
but rather to acknowledge Monarchy as the dominant leader-
ship style of Armenians from Bronze Age until the second half
of the 14th century.
2. Agathangeghos's History of the Armenians, Trans. and a comm.
Robert W. Thomson (Albany, NY: State University of New
York Press 1976), 331-347. Thomson gives details about vari-
ous versions of the texts ofAgathangelos in the introduction part
of the above work (1976, xxi). He has done an extensive and
comparative study of Agathangelos. He distinguishes eight ver-
sions of this antiquity that have been translated and developed
throughout centuries: in Armenian text, three Greek texts, three
Arabic, and a Karshuni version. The earliest Armenian text of
the History of Agathangelos available today is the Mechitarist
library version at Vienna, Austria (1891, No. 56).
3. Frend (1972) goes on to say, "This gave Christianity from the
outset the characteristics of a national movement, a symbol of
identity in the face of the rival empires of Rome and Persia.
The old pagan priesthood tended to merge into the new eccle-
siastical hierarchy. The relationship between the head of the
church, or Catholicos, and the king resembled that of the ruler
and chief minister, and for more than a century the Catholicate
Malakyan 11
was occupied by a member of the house of Gregory the
Illuminator" (p. 309).
4. Yakovlev's "Collectivity of Leadership--The Highest Principle
of Party Leadership," where the author attempts to go back to
Lenin's leadership principles, was published in Communist
