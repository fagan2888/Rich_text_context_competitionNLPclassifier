Objectives. Although higher quality marriages are associated with better health outcomes, less is known about the
mechanisms accounting for this association. This study examines links among marital/partner quality, stress, and blood
pressure and considers both main and moderating effects.
Method. Participants from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 1,854; aged 57­85 years) com-
pleted in-person interviews regarding their marital/romantic partner relationships and perceived stress. Interviews
included blood pressure assessments.
Results. Linear regression models revealed no main effects of spousal/partner quality or stress on blood pressure.
However, spousal/partner quality moderated the link between stress and blood pressure. Specifically, there were nega-
tive associations between stress and blood pressure among people reporting more confiding, less reliance, and greater
demands from spouses/partners.
Discussion. Findings highlight the complexity of relationship quality. Individuals appeared to benefit from aspects of
both high- and low-quality spouse/partner relations but only under high levels of stress. Findings are inconsistent with
traditional moderation hypotheses, which suggest that better quality ties buffer the stress­health link and lower quality
ties exacerbate the stress­health link. Results offer preliminary evidence concerning how spousal ties "get under the skin"
to influence physical health.
Key Words: Blood pressure--Cardiovascular health--Marriage--Relationship quality.
Marriage has significant beneficial effects on health
and well-being. For instance, married individuals
report better physical health (Lorenz, Wickrama, Conger, &
Elder, 2006; Waite & Gallagher, 2000) and live longer than
unmarried individuals (Gardner & Oswald, 2004; Manzoli,
Villari, Pirone, & Boccia, 2007). Yet, significant diversity
exists among married individuals in the quality of their mar-
riages. Recent studies acknowledge that both negative (i.e.,
irritations and conflict) and positive (i.e., love and support)
aspects of marriage have important implications for health
and well-being (Slatcher, 2010). Positive quality marriages
are associated with fewer psychological and physical health
problems, whereas negative quality marriages are related
to poorer health and well-being (Bookwala, 2005; Kiecolt-
Glaser & Newton, 2001). There is a debate in the literature,
however, regarding whether relationship quality directly or
indirectly influences health (Cohen, 2004; Uchino, 2004).
The main effect model suggests that relationship quality has
a direct association with health irrespective of stress levels
(House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988), whereas the moderat-
ing effect model suggests that relationship quality is par-
ticularly influential under higher levels of stress (Cohen &
Wills, 1985).
There is also a debate in the literature regarding the
specific biological mechanisms accounting for the links
between relationships and health. The biopsychosocial
model suggests that the cardiovascular system may be a
significant pathway by which relationships influence overall
health status (Seeman, 2003). However, studies of marital/
partner quality, stress, and cardiovascular health typically
involve younger married couples in a laboratory setting
(Uchino, Birmingham, & Berg, 2010). We know little about
these links in the larger population, and the associations
between relationships and health may be even greater
among older individuals for whom health problems are
often present (Crimmins et al., 2005; Steptoe et al., 2003).
This study is designed to address these gaps in the literature
by examining associations among positive and negative
marital/partner quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure
among a large national sample of older adults. We address
two aims: first, we examine the direct associations among
marital/partner quality, stress, and blood pressure; second,
we assess whether marital/partner relationship quality
moderates the link between stress and blood pressure.
Theoretical Framework
The overarching theoretical framework guiding this
study is referred to as the Biopsychosocial Model of
Marriage, which incorporates three models: the main and
moderating models of relationship quality and the biopsy-
chosocial model of health (Engel, 1977; Lindau, Laumann,
188
Levinson, & Waite, 2003). By including these three mod-
els, this framework provides an integrative approach to the
marriage/health association and the mechanisms that may
explain possible links. The main effect model suggests
that there is a direct association between relationships and
health irrespective of stress (House et al., 1988; Loucks
et al., 2006; Seeman, 1996); for example, studies show that
greater spousal quality predicts better physical and mental
health. The moderating effect model states that spousal/
partner relationships are particularly influential under
stressful life circumstances: high-quality relationships may,
for example, prevent stress or reduce negative reactions
to it (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Uchino, 2004). At the same
time, poor-quality relationships may exacerbate the influ-
ence of stress on health (August, Rook, & Newsom, 2007).
Furthermore, according to the biospsychosocial model of
health, social (e.g., relationship quality) and psychological
factors (e.g., stress) influence overall health via biological
pathways or mechanisms (Engel, 1977; Lindau et al., 2003;
Seeman, 2003).
This study examines one particularly important biologi-
cal pathway that may account for the associations among
marital/partner quality, stress, and health: the cardiovascu-
lar system (Uchino, 2009). The cardiovascular system is
particularly important to examine, as heart disease is the
leading cause of death among older Americans (Delgado,
Jacobs, Lackland, Evans, & Mendes de Leon, 2012). The
cardiovascular system--the heart and blood vessels--is
responsible for maintaining blood flow under changing
environmental circumstances (Krantz & Falconer, 1995).
Blood pressure is a measure of the functioning of this sys-
tem (Crimmins & Seeman, 2000), defined as the force of
blood against the walls of the blood vessels. Systolic pres-
sure is the point of contraction representing the peak pres-
sure, whereas diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure
when the heart relaxes. Researchers have found that factors
such as loneliness and increased stress are associated with
increased systolic blood pressure (Hawkley, Masi, Berry, &
Cacioppo, 2006; Steptoe et al., 2003), and chronic stress is
associated with increased diastolic blood pressure (Piazza,
Almeida, Dmitrieva, & Klein, 2010). It is particularly
important to examine both systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure because the findings vary depending on the measure-
ment, and either measure can be diagnostic of high blood
pressure, that is, individuals can be considered hypertensive
if systolic pressure is greater than 140mm Hg or diastolic
pressure is greater than 90mm Hg (Williams, Pham-Kanter,
& Leitsch, 2009).
It is also especially important to examine blood pressure
among older adults, since blood pressure tends to increase
with age and is associated with increased cardiovascular dis-
ease (Crimmins et al., 2005). Studies show that older peo-
ple show greater systolic blood pressure reactivity to stress
than do younger people (Uchino et al., 2010), although
some research also suggests that high blood pressure may
be protective among the oldest old (Goodwin, 2003). This
study considers associations among marital/partner rela-
tionship quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure--both
systolic and diastolic.
Main Effect of Relationship Quality and Stress
on Health
The relatively small body of research concerning the
direct links between positive marital quality and health
has revealed mixed findings. Uchino and colleagues
(1996) reviewed the literature and found that positive
quality relations with family--typically, a spouse--was
associated with improved function of the cardiovascu-
lar system, above the influence of health-related behav-
iors. Similarly, Holt-Lunstad, Birmingham, and Jones
(2008) found that positive marital quality was associ-
ated with lower ambulatory blood pressure and overall
stress. However, positive aspects of relationships are
not always beneficial for health. Birditt and Antonucci
(2008) examined associations between marital quality
(positive, negative) and mortality among individuals
aged 40-96. Somewhat surprisingly, participants who
reported greater love from spouses at baseline had higher
mortality rates.
Negative aspects of the marital tie are also directly
linked with health outcomes in complex ways. Robles
and Kiecolt-Glaser (2003) found that negative and hostile
behaviors during marital conflict discussions were related
to increased cardiovascular activity. Conversely, negativ-
ity may not always have harmful effects on health. Indeed,
some studies show that greater negativity in relationships is
associated with improvements in health behaviors, such as
exercise (Krause, Goldenhar, Liang, Jay, & Maeda, 1993).
Thus, the positive and negative aspects of spousal/partner
ties may have complex associations with blood pressure.
Additionally, stress itself is thought to have a main effect
on blood pressure. That is, increased stress is associated
with higher blood pressure (Steptoe et al., 2003).
Moderating Effect of Relationship Quality on the
Stress­Health Link
A small number of studies conceptualize positive marital
quality as a buffer or moderator between stress and health
outcomes. For example, Medalie and Goldbourt (1976)
found that, among Israeli men aged 40 and older, support
and love from a spouse buffered the influence of stress on
future angina. Similarly, happily married working women
recovered more quickly from work-related stress than their
unhappily married counterparts (Saxbe, Repetti, & Nishina,
2008). In patients recovering from congestive heart failure,
spouses who reported better quality relationships survived
longer (Coyne et al., 2001). Bookwala (2011) examined the
moderating role of spousal support and satisfaction on the
link between poor vision and functional limitations among
MARITAL QUALITY 189
older adults and found inconsistent moderating effects.
Greater marital satisfaction buffered the link, whereas
greater marital support exacerbated the link between poor
vision and functional limitations. Thus, it appears that
greater positive quality relations can buffer or exacerbate
the link between stress and health.
Few studies have examined the exacerbating effects of
negative marital relationship quality on the stress­health
link and results are mixed. Wang and colleagues (2007)
found that, in female cardiac patients, thickening of coro-
nary arterial walls worsened for those who experienced
greater marital stress. In contrast, people with chronic ill-
nesses who reported negative spousal relationships exhib-
ited decreased mortality (Birditt & Antonucci, 2008).
Antonucci, Birditt, and Webster (2010), however, found no
exacerbating effects for negative spousal relationship qual-
ity in the association between chronic illness and mortal-
ity. These particular findings highlight the need for further
understanding of the potential role of marital relationship
quality as a moderator of the stress­health link.
Relationship Quality: Assessing Specific
Behaviors
Research findings regarding positive and negative mari-
tal quality may be mixed because the behaviors assessed
within the global measures of relationship quality have dis-
parate associations with health. Recent studies indicate that
item-level analyses show a more nuanced--and often more
accurate--pattern of behavioral correlates (Hoppmann &
Smith, 2007; Helson & Kwan, 2000). For example, Birditt
and Antonucci (2008) examined relationship quality items
separately and found that participants who reported greater
spousal love had increased mortality, whereas low levels
of spousal listening was associated with increased mortal-
ity, indicating that behaviors that are often included in an
overall positive quality scale (i.e., greater love) may have
opposite effects. Thus, analyzing behavior at the item level
could alleviate some confusion in this area. In this study,
we examine two positive quality items and two negative
quality items separately to assess the degree to which indi-
viduals confide in their spouse, rely on their spouse for sup-
port, their spouse is demanding, and their spouse is critical.
Because there is no research examining these behaviors
and blood pressure specifically, we do not make predictions
at the item level.
Present Study
This study examines associations among spousal/partner
quality, stress, and blood pressure among older individu-
als. Because this study considers spousal quality as well as
the quality of relations with live-in partners and romantic
partners, we refer to quality as spousal/partner relationship
quality. It is important to examine relationships beyond the
spousal tie because older individuals are less likely to be in
marital relationships compared with middle-aged individu-
als due to widowhood and divorce (Brown & Lin, 2012;
Huyck, 2001; U.S. Census, 2010). Individuals who are wid-
owed or divorced may choose not to remarry but to have
romantic relations or cohabit, and these ties may have sig-
nificant effects on their health (Chevan, 1996). This study
addressed two questions:
1. What are the main effects of spousal/partner relation-
ship quality (positive, negative) and stress on systolic
and diastolic blood pressure?
We hypothesized that individuals with lower quality
spousal/partner ties (i.e., lower levels of confiding in
spouse/partner, and/or reliance on spouse/partner for
help, or higher levels of spousal/partner demands and/
or criticism) would have higher blood pressure. We also
hypothesized that individuals who reported greater per-
ceived stress would have higher blood pressure.
2. Does spousal/partner relationship quality moderate
the associations between perceived stress and blood
pressure?
We hypothesized that the association between perceived
stress and blood pressure would be weaker among peo-
ple with better quality spousal/partner relationships (i.e.,
higher levels of being able to confide in spouse/partner
and/or being able to rely on spouse/partner for help, as
well as lower levels of spousal/partner demands and/or
criticism) and stronger among individuals with lower
quality spousal/partner relationships.
Methods
Participants and Procedure
Participants were from the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP; Waite et al., 2010), a nation-
ally representative probability survey of 3,005 individu-
als (52% women) aged 57­85 years. The sampling design
involved multiple stages: two area stages for the selection
of geographical regions, a household selection stage, and
an individual selection stage in which one individual was
selected from each household for the interview. Oldest old,
men, African Americans, and Latinos were oversampled.
The response rate was 75.5%.
InterviewswereconductedfromJuly2005toMarch2006.
Participants completed at-home, face-to-face interviews that
included a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) as
well as a biomeasure component including blood pressure
readings.
For the purpose of this study, we included only partici-
pants who were married, living with a partner, or those with
a romantic partner (n = 2,013; 67% of the sample). One hun-
dred and fifty-nine participants were missing data and were
thus removed from the study. The final sample included
1,854 participants with complete data on all predictors, out-
comes, and covariates. A total of 1,691 of participants were
190 BIRDITT ET AL.
married (59% men), 55 were living with a partner (42%
men), and 108 had romantic partners (63% men). Overall,
participants were in relatively good health, reporting good-
to-very good health on average (M = 3.39, SE = 0.04).
Participants were distributed across three age groups: 47%
were aged 57­64, 35% were aged 65­74, and 18% were
aged 75­85 years. We conducted a logistic regression anal-
ysis to determine whether the complete sample varied from
those with incomplete data among individuals with partners
(spouses, cohabiting, or romantic). Individuals with com-
plete data were more likely to be women and had higher
self-rated health than individuals with incomplete data.
There were no other significant differences for those with
complete data on the demographics (age, education, race),
spousal/partner relationship quality, or stress. See Table 1
for a description of the sample.
Measures
Blood pressure.--Blood pressure readings were taken
with the Lifesource digital blood pressure monitor Model
UA-767PVL, following guidelines adapted from the
manufacturer's instruction guide (Williams et al., 2009).
Participants were seated with their feet flat on the floor and
their left arm laid on a surface with the palm up. The cuff
size was visually estimated and two blood pressure meas-
urements were taken with a 1
min pause between them.
A third reading was taken if the first two readings were sub-
stantially different (systolic  20mm Hg/diastolic  14mm
Hg; Williams et al., 2009). The blood pressure scores reflect
the mean across the multiple blood pressure readings.
Relationship quality.--Participants rated the positive and
negative qualities of their relationships with a spouse or
romantic, intimate, or sexual partner. The positive quality
items were: "How often can you open up to your spouse/
partner if you need to talk about your worries?" and "How
often can you rely on your spouse/partner for help if you
have a problem?" The negative quality items were: "How
often does your spouse/partner make too many demands on
you?" and "How often does your spouse/partner criticize
you?" Participant response options included: 1 (hardly ever
[or never]), 2 (some of the time), or 3 (often). These items
are from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2002
(module 6) questionnaire and have been used in subsequent
waves of the HRS study. We considered whether to com-
bine the positive and negative items into scales; however,
the alphas were relatively low: 0.60 for positive and 0.59
for negative. In addition, previous studies have found that
relationship quality items often behave differently when
predicting health outcomes and have examined them sepa-
rately (Birditt &Antonucci, 2008). Thus, we examined each
item separately and refer to them as confiding, reliance,
demands, and criticism.
Stress.--Participants completed a four-item per-
ceived stress scale derived from Cohen, Karmarck, and
Mermelstein's (1983) global measure of perceived stress.
The specific items included: "I was unable to control impor-
tant things in my life," "I felt difficulties were piling up so
high that I could not overcome them," "I felt confident about
my ability to handle personal problems (reverse coded),"
and "I felt that things were going my way (reverse coded)."
Participant response options included 1 (rarely or none of
the time), 2 (some of the time), 3 (occasionally), or 4 (most
of the time); a mean was calculated to create a stress score
( = 0.63).
Covariates.--We included several covariates associated
with relationship quality and health (Antonucci, 2001;
House et al., 1988). Gender was coded as 1 (women) or 0
(men).Age was included as a continuous variable. Education
was coded as 0 (less than high school) or 1 (high school
or greater). Race was coded as 1 (non-White) or 0 (white).
Because associations with blood pressure vary depending
on whether individuals take antihypertension medicine
(Qato, Schumm, Johnson, Mihai, & Lindau, 2009), we
controlled for antihypertension medicine in the analyses of
blood pressure. There is debate in the literature regarding
the best methods for adjusting for medication use, and we
conducted additional sensitivity analyses comparing some
of the methods in the Results section. Individuals were
coded as 1 if they were taking one or more of the following

medications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
beta-andrenergic blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel
blockers (Qato et al., 2009).
Analysis strategy.--All data were weighted before con-
ducting analyses in line with recommendations for ana-
lyzing the NSHAP data (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &
Smith, 2009). The weight takes into account the probabil-
ity of selection and adjusts for nonresponse. In addition to
the weight variable, we included variables to adjust for the
multiple-stage sampling design.
We assessed main effect and moderating models with
multiple regression analyses. Main effect models examining
relationship quality included all quality items (confiding,
reliance, demands, criticism) and stress as predictors. The
moderating models included the interaction between stress
and each of the quality variables as predictors. All mod-
els included gender, age, education, and race as covariates.
All continuous variables were grand mean-centered and
categorical variables were effect was coded (-1, 1) as sug-
gested by Aiken and West (1991). Models were estimated
separately to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Significant interactions were explored by calculating the
simple slopes (Aiken & West, 1991). Interactions were plot-
ted in graphs with stress on the x-axis and blood pressure on
the y-axis with relationship quality as the grouping variable
(1 SD less than and 1 SD greater than the mean).
Results
The results are presented in three sections. First, spouse/
partner relationship quality, stress, and blood pressure
are described. Next, the main effects of spouse/partner
relationship quality and perceived stress on blood pressure
were examined. Finally, the moderating effects of spouse/
partner relationship quality on the stress­blood pressure
link were assessed.
Description of the Data
Overall, participants reported low levels of perceived stress
(Table 1), as well as high levels of positive relationship quality
and low levels of negative relationship quality with spouses/
partners. A total of 43% of the participants had hypertension,
which is defined as systolic greater than or equal to 140mm
Hg or diastolic greater than or equal to 90mm Hg according
to the American Heart Association guidelines.
Correlations among stress, spouse/partner relationship
quality, and blood pressure were calculated. The two posi-
tive quality items were positively correlated (r = .43, p <
.01), and the two negative quality items were positively cor-
related (r = .43, p < .01). The four relationship quality varia-
bles had low correlations with blood pressure ranging from
-.003 to .03. Stress was positively correlated with nega-
tive quality (demands, r = .13, criticize, r = .12; p < .01)
and negatively correlated with positive relationship quality
(confide, r = -.16, rely, r = -.16; p < .01). Stress was not
significantly associated with blood pressure.
What are the Main Effects of Spousal/Partner
Relationship Quality (Positive and Negative) and Stress
on Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure?
Models revealed that there were no main effects of
spousal/partner relationship quality or stress on blood pres-
sure (Table 2). This was inconsistent with our hypotheses

that individuals who reported greater spouse/partner rela-
tionship quality and lower stress would have lower blood
pressure.
Does Spousal/Partner Relationship Quality Moderate
the Associations Between Perceived Stress and Blood
Pressure?
Models revealed moderating effects of spousal relation-
ship quality on the stress­blood pressure link.
Positive spousal quality.--We found significant inter-
actions between spousal/partner confiding and stress
when predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(Table 2). Consistent with our hypothesis, the simple
slope tests revealed that the association between stress
and systolic blood pressure was negative among partici-
pants who reported higher levels of confiding (B = -3.53,
p < .05; Figure 1). The association between stress and
blood pressure was not significant among participants
who reported lower levels of confiding. The simple slope
tests for diastolic blood pressure were similar, but only
approached significance. Overall, these findings indicate
that the association between stress and blood pressure
may be reduced among individuals with greater spousal
confiding.
We also found significant interactions between relying
on a spouse/partner and stress when predicting systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (Table 2; Figures 2 and 3).
Unexpectedly and inconsistent with our hypothesis, the
association between stress and blood pressure was negative
among individuals who reported lower relying on spouse/
partner (systolic B = -3.54, p < .05; diastolic B = -1.56,
p < .05). The slopes were not significant among people who
reported greater reliance on spouse/partner. This finding
indicates that relying less on spouse/partners moderates
the stress­blood pressure link. Interestingly, relying less
on a spouse/partner appeared to have negative effects on
health when individuals were under low levels of stress but
beneficial effects on health when individuals were under
high levels of stress.
Negative spousal quality.--We found a significant inter-
action between spouse/partner demands and stress when
predicting systolic blood pressure (Table 2; Figure 4).
Unexpectedly, the association between stress and systolic
blood pressure was negative among people who reported
greater spouse/partner demands (B = -3.53, p < .05). In con-
trast, there was no association between stress and systolic
blood pressure among people who reported lower spouse/
partner demands. This finding indicates that the stress­
blood pressure link is moderated by greater spousal/part-
ner demands. It appears that high spousal/partner demands
were associated with poorer health among individuals with
lower stress but better health among individuals under
higher stress.
Post Hoc Analyses
The associations among stress, relationship quality, and
blood pressure may vary depending on whether individuals
are in more committed relationships or not (married/living
with partner vs. romantic partners). Therefore, models were
reestimated excluding individuals with romantic partners.
All findings were the same with one exception. The stress
by confiding interaction predicting systolic blood pressure
became a trend, which may have been due to the decrease
in power after removing romantic partners.
The associations may also vary depending on the duration
of the relationship. Relationship duration information was
available for individuals who were married or cohabitating;
thus analyses were estimated controlling for relationship
duration among the married and cohabitating individuals,
and the same pattern of results emerged.

Because the spousal tie and links between the spousal
tie and health often varies by gender (Kiecolt-Glaser &
Newton, 2001), models were reestimated with all possible
two-way and three-way interactions among relationship
quality, stress, and gender. Although there were two signifi-
cant three-way interactions when predicting diastolic blood
pressure, one among gender, criticism, and stress and the
other among gender, demands, and stress, the tests of the
simple slopes were not significant.
We were concerned that participants may have varied in
their overall physical health, which may account for some
of the associations. Self-rated health is a particularly impor-
tant determinant of well-being in the spousal relationship
(Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, & Cartwright, 2009). Thus,
all models were estimated again controlling for self-rated
physical health, and the findings remained the same.
Finally, there is debate regarding whether to control for
antihypertension medication when predicting blood pres-
sure or to use other methods of adjustment (Tobin, Sheehan,
Scurrah, & Burton, 2005). Analyses were conducted again
without controlling for hypertension medicine, and the find-
ings remained the same.Analyses were also conducted after
adding a constant of 10 to systolic and a constant of 5 to
diastolic blood pressure among individuals taking antihy-
pertension medication as recommended in previous studies,
and the same pattern of results emerged (Cui, Hopper, &
Harrap, 2003; Tobin et al., 2005).
Discussion
Using data from the NSHAP, this study examined asso-
ciations among spousal/partner relationship quality, stress,
and blood pressure. Results support the moderating effect
model which posits that in the context of stressful life events
or circumstances, spousal/partner relationships are particu-
larly influential by either preventing stress or reducing nega-
tive reactions to it. We found no evidence for the main effect
model, which posits that a direct association between rela-
tionship quality and health exists irrespective of stress. The
findings also showed that the effects of relationship quality
are nuanced, with both negative and positive relationships
having unique effects in the stress­health link. This study
makes a distinctive contribution to the literature by exam-
ining the link between spousal/partner relationship qual-
ity and blood pressure in the presence of perceived stress
among older individuals and providing insights into the
mechanisms linking spousal/partner relations and health.
These results support the body of research that identifies
biological pathways linking social relationships to health
(Uchino et al., 1996). According to the biopsychosocial
model of health, social and psychological factors influence
overall health via biological pathways or mechanisms such
as the cardiovascular system (Engel, 1977). In line with this
model, this research examined the implications of social
(spousal/partner quality) and psychological factors (stress)
for the cardiovascular system (blood pressure) in order to
further understand the spousal relationship­health link. The
findings suggest that the cardiovascular system may be an
important pathway by which relationships "get under the
skin" to influence health.
Few studies conceptualize spousal/partner quality as a
moderator between stress and health outcomes. For those
that do, particularly those examining negative relationship
qualities, the results have been mixed (Antonucci et al.,
2010; Birditt & Antonucci, 2008). This study provides
further understanding regarding the role of not only nega-
tive spousal/partner relationship quality in the association
between stress and health, but also a more complex picture
of the role of positive spousal/partner quality. Furthermore,
this study revealed that marriage as well as cohabitation
and romantic partners have important influences on health
among older adults. Our focus on older adults is also novel,
given that the majority of previous research has focused on
younger couples. For older adults, chronic health problems
are likely to be more prevalent, especially in the case of
higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (Crimmins
et al., 2005; Steptoe et al., 2003).
Positive Relationship Quality
The present findings concerning positive spousal/partner
quality as a moderator between stress and health are only
somewhat consistent with the sparse literature on this topic.
The moderator model suggests that positive quality rela-
tionships buffer the influence of stress on health. However,
we did not find links between stress and health, which is
necessary for a buffering model (Cohen & Wills, 1985).
This study showed that the association between stress and
health does vary by positive quality ties but in expected
and unexpected ways. Specifically, the negative association
between stress and blood pressure for participants reporting
higher levels of confiding with their spouse/partner corre-
sponds with research concerning recovery from both work
stress and congestive heart failure. That is, happily married
women recovered from work-related stress more quickly
than unhappily married women (Saxbe et al., 2008), and
patients recovering from congestive heart failure who
reported better quality relationships survived longer (Coyne
et al., 2001). Thus, greater confiding in spouses appears to
reduce the association between stress and blood pressure.
However, counter to our hypothesis, we found no
association between stress and blood pressure for
individuals reporting high reliance on their spouse, a finding
which does not entirely support previous literature. In fact,
the stress­health link was negative only among participants
who reported lower spousal/partner reliance. Bookwala
(2011) similarly found that greater spousal support
exacerbated the link between poor vision and functional
health. This finding is consistent with research concerning
the dependence-support script and the independence-ignore
MARITAL QUALITY 195
script (Baltes, 1996), which holds that, for older individuals
especially, dependent behaviors tend to elicit more attention;
meanwhile, independent behaviors are essentially ignored.
Particularly in long-term or close relationships, where
behaviors tend to become ingrained, these scripts can lead
to a loss of autonomy and control and may exacerbate any
sense of helplessness and frustration in a stressful situation.
Indeed, studies show that individuals may perceive support
as over-protective or ineffective, which can be harmful to
health (Hagedoorn et al., 2000). The findings also support
the research indicating that individuals who receive support
that they are not aware of (i.e., invisible support) have better
well-being (Bolger, Kessler, & Zuckerman, 2000).
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design,
however, it is possible that blood pressure influences rela-
tionship processes in the contexts of different stress levels.
For example, individuals with lower blood pressure may
rely less on spouses in times of stress because they feel less
vulnerable and may have more diverse networks (with other
ties to rely on) than individuals with higher blood pressure.
Negative Relationship Quality
Interestingly, greater negative relationship quality moder-
ated the stress­health link but not in a way that was con-
sistent with the exacerbation model. Inconsistent with our
hypothesis, greater spousal demands appeared to reduce the
link between stress and blood pressure. Similarly, Birditt and
Antonucci (2008) found that individuals with life-threaten-
ing illnesses survived longer when they reported greater neg-
ative spousal quality (high demands or criticism). Spousal/
partner demands may be necessary or helpful (e.g., demands
to comply with a medical regimen or to think deeply about a
stressful situation). Likewise, spousal demands may involve
demands for support, which may be beneficial for health.
Providing support to spouses is associated with better health
than receiving support (Brown, Nesse, Vinokur, & Smith,
2003). In contrast, spouses with higher blood pressure
who are under greater stress may receive greater spousal
demands (e.g., to exercise or take medication). Because of
the cross-sectional nature of the study design, we are unable
to determine the specific direction of effects.
Limitations and Future Directions
As with most studies, the present research has limita-
tions. Although rich, these data are cross-sectional and
as such cannot identify directional links. Future research
would benefit from follow-up studies with these particu-
lar participants (or other longitudinal studies) in order to
examine bidirectional links among spouse/partner relation-
ship quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure over time.
Measurement of all constructs of interest--marital quality,
stress, and blood pressure--could no doubt have been more
thorough, a situation common to survey research. As an
example, only four items assessed relationship quality; we
lack information regarding the relationship processes that
underlie the reports of relationship quality. For instance, do
spousal or partner demands include those involving health
behaviors? We need to include more extensive measures
of spousal/partner quality in future studies (e.g., conflict,
coping strategies, and satisfaction with support). Further,
the measurement of blood pressure did not include controls
such as a specified rest time prior to measurement or prohi-
bition of caffeinated beverages, which are often included in
more controlled laboratory or clinical settings.
Moreover, this study did not examine the influence of
other potentially important relationships, such as relation-
ships with children, grandchildren, extended family, and
friends. These types of relationships, beyond the spouse/
partner relationship, are important to assess as they can
provide important resources in times of stress, and thus
shed light on the broader social milieu in which the stress­
health link resides.
This study highlights the often complicated nature of
spouse/partner relationship quality, stress, and their asso-
ciations with biological pathways. Stress appears to be
less detrimental for health when individuals perceive their
spousal/partner tie as emotionally supportive, less reliable,
and more demanding. These findings emphasize the impor-
tance of examining the influence of multiple dimensions of
spousal/partner relationship quality on the health processes
of older adults.
