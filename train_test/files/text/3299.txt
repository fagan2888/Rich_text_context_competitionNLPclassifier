Background
Like many other African countries, Kenya has struggled in
the past two decades to get the best, most effective, and
responsive programs, strategies, policies, and approaches for
combating the menacing HIV pandemic. The disease has not
spared any country. It has affected both rich and poor coun-
tries (Ndambuki, McCretton, Rider, Gichuru, & Wildish,
2006).
The first AIDS case in Kenya was diagnosed in 1984. In
1985, the government established the National AIDS
Committee to advise the Ministry of Health in Kenya (MOH)
on matters related to HIV control. In 1986, the MOH formu-
lated policy statements and guidelines on safe blood supply.
The First Medium Term Plan was developed in 1987.
Although the highest rates of infection were initially concen-
trated in marginalized and special risk groups, for more than
a decade Kenya has faced a mixed HIV epidemic; new infec-
tions occurred in the general population and vulnerable,
high-risk groups. In 1999, the Government of Kenya (GOK)
declared the HIV epidemic a national disaster and estab-
lished the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) to coor-
dinate the multisectoral response to HIV.
The GOK responded by publishing informative articles in
the press and launching a poster campaign urging people to
use condoms and avoid indiscriminate sex. Since then, HIV
prevalence has been found to be highest among a number of
groups, such as sex workers, injecting drug users (IDUs),
men who have sex with men (MSM), truck drivers, and
cross-border mobile populations. Up to one third of new
infections in 2008 were within these "key populations at
higher risk."
Prevalence Rates and HIV Knowledge
and Behavior
According to the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS;
2008/2009), HIV prevalence rates among the general popu-
lation aged 15 to 49 years was 7.4%, whereas the Kenya
Demographic Health Survey (KDHS; 2009) estimated prev-
alence in the same population at 6.2%. The findings show
that Kenya's epidemic has stabilized in the past few years.
The estimated number of people living with HIV (PLWHIV)
is 1.3 million to 1.6 million. New infections were estimated

Priming HIV Messages in Kenyan Print
Media: Patterns, Trends, and Issues

Abstract
This paper is an investigation into the role of the print media in combating the HIV epidemic in Kenya. A critical analysis
of how this information is covered is necessary to determine whether there is need for change of style in the presentation
of this information . This is so because till date, there exists a gap in literature on how preventive knowledge on HIV is
presented in the Kenyan print media. The data for this paper was gathered using both quantitative and qualitative designs.
The paper relied mainly on the content analysis methodology in which the Daily Nation newspapers were searched for articles
on HIV. The Daily Nation was purposively studied for this paper because it has the largest selling publication with the highest
circulation and therefore, can adequately represent Kenya's newspapers. All the issues of the year 2010 were purposively
studied and this yielded a total of 365 copies for this paper. Findings of this paper indicate that the print media in Kenya lack
consistency in the coverage of HIV issues. They also lack a clear editorial policy on the coverage of the epidemic that could
guide in a sustained and effective method of coverage of the epidemic. Prominence of the HIV articles, which is a very crucial
aspect in coverage, is also found to be lacking. This paper recommends that the print media should focus on consistency in
their coverage... It is The print media should involve the general public, including people living with HIV in the discussion of
the epidemic.

at 100,000 in 2009 for adults (15 years and above). The HIV
prevention Response and Modes of Transmission Analysis
(2009) found that the largest new infections (44%) occur
among men and women who are in a union or in regular part-
nerships, MSM and prisoners contribute about 15% of new
infections, and IDUs account for 3.8%.
HIV prevalence rates are generally higher in urban
areas, with an average of 16% to 17%, than in rural areas
that had an average of 11% to 12% . HIV and AIDS educa-
tion is an essential part of HIV prevention. In Kenya, HIV
education is part of the curriculum in both primary and
secondary schools, and for a number of years, Kenya has
delivered educational campaigns to raise nationwide
awareness of the issue. As a result, awareness about HIV
and AIDS in Kenya is high.
The KDHS 2008/2009 shows that knowledge of HIV pre-
vention methods is high: 75% of women and 81% of men
aged 15 to 49 know that use of condoms can reduce the risk
of getting AIDS virus, and 92% of women and 93% of men
know that abstinence or limiting sexual intercourse to only
one uninfected partner reduces chance of getting HIV. A sig-
nificant reduction in HIV stigma has also been noted. In
2003, 26.5% of women and 39.5% of men indicated accept-
ing attitudes toward people with HIV. This percentage
increased to 47.5% for men and 32.6% for women.
Research shows that the media is a very powerful tool in
the formation of opinion in any society. It is, therefore, of
greatest essence for journalists to exercise the power of their
profession judiciously in the dissemination of information on
HIV and AIDS.
The Socioeconomic Impact of HIV
HIV has a profound effect on the national development of
any country. This is particularly so because the most affected
are the economically productive young people. It also causes
hardships in families by increasing expenditure in health
care. Furthermore, the loss of skilled uniformed officers
poses security challenges.
According to the Kenya National HIV and Aids Strategic
Plan 2005-2010, HIV has major economic and social impact
on individuals, families, communities, and society as a
whole. Research across more severely affected, low-income
countries clearly demonstrates that HIV is the most serious
impediment to economic growth and development in such
countries; there is no reason to expect Kenya to be an excep-
tion (Kenya National Aids strategic Plan [KNASP]
2005/2006-2009/2010).
Media and HIV Prevention
The media has the social responsibility to ensure that infor-
mation relating to HIV is on the public domain. To achieve
this responsibility, journalists should strive to write clearly
and objectively on the subject.
The choice of the print media and particularly the Daily
Nation for this paper was informed by the fact that portable
media can be carried away and used later. This enables the
audience to repeat and review the messages, hence, reinforc-
ing their behavior change. Behavioral models in the print
media may become more influential by virtue of the media
themselves, which appear to have a status-conferred function
for information sources in popular news and entertainment
(McAlister, 1991).
According to the KDHS (2009-2010), the future course of
Kenya's AIDS epidemic depends on a number of factors,
which include HIV-related knowledge among the general
population, social stigmatization, risk behavior modification,
access to quality health care and services for sexually trans-
mitted infections, provision and uptake of HIV counseling
and testing, and access to care and antiretroviral therapy,
including prevention and treatment of opportunistic infec-
tions. In collaboration with various stakeholders, the Kenya
NACC developed the 2009/2010 to 2012/2013 Kenya
National Aids Strategic Plan III (KNASP III), which was
launched in January 2010. Although HIV prevalence seems
to have stabilized, new HIV infections have been estimated
at 166,000 annually. The plan was therefore focused on pre-
vention of new infections, reduction of HIV-related illnesses
and death, and mitigation of the effects of the epidemic on
households and communities.
The awareness of HIV is universal with 99% of women
and 100% of men in the 15 to 49 years age bracket. The only
group for which the level of awareness of AIDS falls below
98% is women and men with the lowest wealth quintile. The
prevalence of knowledge was already high in 2003 (99% of
women and men having heard of AIDS; KDHS 2009-2010).
The success of AIDS prevention and control programs
worldwide depends on the ability of information, education,
and communication (IEC) interventions to address this issue
and establish norms of safe sex that are acceptable to (and
feasible for) sexually active populations. Therefore, one of
the prerequisites to the development of effective interven-
tions will be a sound understanding of the dominant patterns
of sexuality around the world and in different cultures and
subcultures (Carballo, Cleland, Carael, & Albretch, 1989).
Knowledge and information are the first lines of defense
for the young people (UNAIDS, 2004). The use of the media
is driven by the recognition that the media can help in reach-
ing those whose status is negative and encourage them to
retain this status, to support those whose status is positive
and urge them to be careful so as not to spread the virus and
to maintain hope through positive living, and in general, to
educate society as a whole to develop sustainable structures
that will contribute to the prevention and effective manage-
ment of HIV.
A key strength of the media in this sense is their agenda
setting capacity. They can sustain a topic for long in the pub-
lic arena and therefore, extensive discussion that supports
some action in a given topic (Kiai, 2000). Other functions of
Mogambi et al. 3
the media with regard to HIV include providing accurate and
factual information on HIV on a regular basis, humanizing
the statistics and demystifying the epidemic, presenting the
public opinion of the disease, educating the public on the
need for community-based structures in HIV prevention and
management, and presenting a holistic picture of HIV as well
as advocating for accountability and responsibility in the
HIV prevention and management sector.
This paper sought to investigate the role that the mass
media and particularly the print media have played in the
dissemination of information concerning HIV in Kenya. In
doing so, the paper also sought to determine the prominence
given to this information by one of Kenya's mainstream
newspapers (Daily Nation) in terms of coverage.
Newspaper Readership in Kenya
According to a survey carried out by the Nation Media Group
(NMG) in 2006, about 7.6 million Kenyans read newspapers.
Since 2000, a slight improvement has been noted for those
who read newspapers daily. The research revealed that daily
newspaper sales increased from 211,437 copies to 215,232
between 2000 and 2005.Arecent survey concluded that most
people (75%) consider the media as a source of credible
information.
The Daily Nation Newspaper
The Daily Nation newspaper is seen as the most influential
of all the newspapers in Kenya. "It is widely regarded as
being independent and balanced". It is the largest newspaper
not only in Kenya but in the whole of East Africa. Its circula-
tion is above 200,000 copies per day but as copies are often
read by many people, the actual readership is much higher. It
has a market share of about 75%. The biggest competitor of
the Daily Nation is The Standard, published by the Standard
Group.
The Daily Nation is a morning newspaper published on
all 7 days of the week, available in all major cities in East
Africa. The Saturday version is called Saturday Nation while
the Sunday version is known as Sunday Nation. Its offices
are located at Kimathi Street in the Nairobi Central Business
District.
The Daily Nation also maintains a website, nation.co.ke,
which publishes many articles from the newspaper and has
more than three million daily page viewers. The website and
its archives are accessible free of charge.
Use of Media Messages in Combating
HIV in Kenya
Since the early 1990s, surveys have indicated that in many
areas of the African continent, widespread awareness of HIV
coexists along with highly skewed detailed knowledge. The
demographic and health surveys conducted during the 1990s
in Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia showed that knowledge of
the disease was almost universal, but very few people were
aware of or believed in the protection offered by condoms
(Caldwell, 1999). This paper therefore looks into the possi-
ble reasons for the lack of effectiveness in the media mes-
sages in disseminating information on HIV.
Scholars have increasingly documented the need to
increase awareness on HIV among people. Ndeti (2004,
2012) posits that adolescents require more information on all
aspects of HIV, including skills of protecting themselves
from infection, resisting peer pressure, being assertive and
negotiating for safer sex. Although this paper focuses on the
kind of information that needs to be included by the media in
the fight against the epidemic, it does not address the equally
important issue of how this information should be presented
to the target audience to ensure its effectiveness.
IEC
Research has shown that IEC approaches are highly effective
in increasing knowledge on HIV but they have minimal
impacts on behavior changes (Wyss, 2001). Based on this
and the fact that the mass media effects in developing coun-
tries is not well documented, this paper examined the print
media messages in combating HIV in Kenya with a view of
looking at how they are presented, the prominence given to
them, and the frequency with which they occur in the
dailies.
The impact of IEC on behavioral changes may be less
strong, and experiences from several industrialized countries
have shown improvements in levels of HIV-related knowl-
edge following mass media campaigns, but limited effect on
behavior. This paper therefore sought to find out if journal-
ists use IEC messages in the print media and the limitations
that they have. It also sought to suggest ways in which these
limitations, if any, could be addressed to make them effective
in causing behavior change among the audience.
Effects of Mass Media Health
Campaigns in Developing Countries
Kenya is one of the developing countries in which print
media campaigns in the fight against HIV has not been well
documented. The media have a pivotal role to play in com-
bating HIV. It is often said that education is the vaccine
against HIV. Research shows that some countries have been
using the media in combating HIV. It has also been observed
that the mass media messages are an important source of
knowledge regarding HIV, but that this knowledge is inade-
quate, and often contains misconceptions (Wyss, 2001).
Salmon andAtkins (2003) argue that health campaigns have
a long, well-established, and respected heritage as an apparatus
for promoting public health and welfare. This phenomenon
has, however, not been witnessed in Kenya despite the pres-
ence of print media, which can be effectively used to influence
4 SAGE Open
behavior changes. The Daily Nation newspaper for instance
can be effectively used in HIV prevention campaign owing to
its national outlook in terms of coverage and readership.
According to World Health Organization (WHO; 2006),
most governments have turned to the mass media as a means
of informing their population, shaping social norms and
influencing behavior associated with the transmission of
HIV. Torwell and Rodney (2010) affirm that the mass media
play a central role in informing the public about health and
medical issues. They further say that the print media, particu-
larly newspapers, have been found to be an effective media
for influencing the general public as well as opinion leaders
on issues of public health.
It is also acknowledged that newspapers are best suited
for explanations and in-depth analysis because of the length
allowed for in print and the relative ease of access. Collins,
Abelson, Pyman, and Lavis (2006) recognized print news as
an integral source of public policy information as well as a
medium to persuade public opinion, depending on selection
and presentation of issues (Torwell & Rodney, 2010).
Presentation of HIV Information in the
Print Media
The way in which information on HIV is presented in print
media to the audience matters a lot if it has to be effective in
behavior change. Doak, Doak, Fredel, and Meade (1998) sug-
gested a number of strategies for effectively presenting
printed information to people with low health literacy. These
strategies are as follows: only give advice that is immediately
essential, divide the information into easy-to-understand
parts, include visual images with each information part, put
all information in the appropriate context, make instructions
interactive, offer visual examples, use testimonials, use active
voice and conversational style, use bullets to organize infor-
mation, and use friendly content that is appealing and cultur-
ally appropriate. If these strategies are adopted by the print
media in Kenya, many positive changes will be brought about
in combating HIV. This paper therefore sought to find out the
way in which information on HIV is presented and suggest
ways in which journalists can improve in the presentation of
this information.
Some of the ways in which information can be presented
to the audience in the print media is through using entertain-
ment columns. In this way, audience will find it more inter-
esting. Singh (2011) argues that media is capable of
preventing HIV with an ultimate goal to cure it through its
capabilities to impart education through entertainment. This
can be effectively used by the Daily Nation Newspaper in its
entertainment columns.
Contribution by Other Stakeholders
To complement the work of journalists in their work of
reporting on HIV and AIDS, other stakeholders, such as
scientists, physicians, public officials, and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) are also important. By increasing pub-
lic awareness, it may also elicit the support that is essential to
bring risks under control (Jha et al., 2001).
Prevention Efforts
Although better ways of keeping people with HIV infec-
tion alive and well were sought, efforts must be intensified
to prevent any further spread of the virus. Prevention is the
key to curtailing the ultimate impact of AIDS. Perhaps, the
main lesson learned so far during this pandemic is that
sexual behavior change is an achievable goal. There is
growing evidence that people from striking diverse cul-
tures on different continents have managed to adopt safer
behaviors, such as having fewer sex partners, choosing
nonpenetrative forms of sex, and, the best documented,
using condoms (Merson, 1993).
Carefully crafted messages by the print media need to
reach the general public so as to ensure truly universal edu-
cation about HIV. However, these behavioral interventions
have hardly been implemented in Kenya, and where they
have been, they are on far too limited a scale to make a real
impact on the pandemic.
Sources of Information on HIV
Sources from which information on HIV are obtained is an
important factor to be considered by the journalists when
they cover stories. It has been argued by different scholars
that because of the complexities surrounding the HIV issues,
journalists require a wide array of information sources to
provide quotes, background information, explanation of
complex aspects or technical details, useful suggestions and
leads, new findings or other news, and even contact with
other sources (Miller & Williams, 1998).
Different sources bring different values to the news on
HIV. One of the most important sources of information is
PLWHIV. This is because they are in an advantaged position
to tell their HIV stories. Therefore, involving PLWHIV as
the sources of stories would help make the information more
pragmatic in fighting the epidemic. This will increase the
effectiveness of the messages in influencing behavior change
in the targeted audiences.
Lule, Seifman, and David (2007-2011) argue that the crit-
ical need to address the HIV problem is reflected in the Sixth
Millenium development Goals (MDG), which seeks to halt
and begin to reverse the spread of HIV by 2015, and to make
access to treatment for HIV universal for all those who need
it. This fundamental goal can be best achieved by increasing
awareness of HIV issues such as prevention ways, in which
it can be transmitted among other issues through the print
media.
Barnett and Whiteside (2006) argue that the relative role
of information, observation, and instruction are important for
Mogambi et al. 5
HIV prevention programs, their design, and understanding of
why they have succeeded or failed. They further say that
information-based decisions are grounded on messages and
the theory of reasoned action and planned behavior rather
than experience or observation.
Use of Different Media in Carrying
Information on HIV
A few countries have been successful in the use of media in
the dissemination of information on HIV. Uganda is often
held up as a model for Africa in the fight against the epi-
demic. This success can be attributed to several factors,
which include strong government leadership, broad-based
partnerships, and effective public education campaigns.
Ugandan experts believe that the simple act of talking has
made profound difference to the course of the country's epi-
demic. The fact that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
allowed a free discussion on HIV in the media, among orga-
nizations and the civil society is cited as a key element of the
country's success in reversing the epidemic (UNAIDS,
2004). Other countries such as Kenya can also adopt the
same strategy of increasing the role of the print media. This
is because the print media has the potential of providing a
platform for important discussions by media personalities,
medical experts, public officials, and the public.
Thailand is another country which has recorded declining
trends of HIV infection. This is a demonstration that the pan-
demic beats a retreat in the face of determined and sustained
massive efforts in generating awareness among people and
empowering people with information to combat it effectively.
Visibility in the media, and informed and sympathetic visibility
at that, is an effective step toward creating greater awareness.
Leaders of the media, in cooperation with other segments of the
society, can play a significant role in educating public opinion.
In the United States of America, the media has been used
successfully to dispel myths which had long been held about
the epidemic. It was, for instance, believed that Aids was a
disease for the gays. When studies began to suggest that het-
erosexual transmission could take place through sex work-
ers, the press responded by increasing coverage (Nelkin,
1991). The Kaiser's National Surveys have also confirmed
that the media in the United States are one of the most impor-
tant resources for information for Americans on HIV--the
media are named more often than health care providers or
schools (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 2004)
In Russia, the Russian Media Partnership to combat HIV
(RMP)--a group of more than 30 media and communica-
tions partners, including TV networks, print partners, radio
networks, and online companies was formed. The partner-
ship launched Russia's first coordinated public education
campaign, STOPSPID (Stop AIDS), on World AIDS Day,
2004 (Transatlantic Partners against Aids, 2005).
In Tanzania, the Radio Tanzania soap opera Twende na
Wakati (Let's Go With the Times), which was first broadcast
in 1993, greatly increased listeners' willingness to discuss
issues related to the virus. After the program had been aired
for several seasons a survey reported that 65% of the respon-
dents said they had spoken to someone about Twende na
Wakati and more than 8 in 10 reported having adopted a HIV
prevention measure as a result of listening to the show
(UNAIDS, 2004).
Benefo (2004) concurs with the argument that mass media
can be effective in combating HIV. He states that conveying
HIV information in the mass media has done a great deal to
teach Ghanaians about the disease. He goes on to say that it
has raised awareness of the importance of using condoms
and partner fidelity and has made fidelity in sexual relations
and condom use to be seen as feasible and likely behavioral
responses to the epidemic.
What this means is that the print media in Kenya can,
therefore, be used effectively in the fight against the epi-
demic if it forms partnerships and come up with programs
designed to prevent transmission of the HIV virus.
Issues
From the review of literature, this paper found out several
issues which need to be addressed. First, most of the scholars
concur that the print media is an invaluable tool in the dis-
semination of information on HIV (Doak et al., 1998; Singh,
2011; WHO, 2006). However, the stakeholders in the fight
against HIV do not seem to have taken the role of the print
media seriously in the fight against HIV. Instead, they have
focused more on areas such as Voluntary Counseling and
Testing (VCT), provision and distribution of condoms, and
provision of antiretroviral treatment for persons living with
AIDS, among other interventions. Despite the fact that all
these measures are important, the government, NGOs, and
other stakeholders in the fight against the AIDS pandemic
should also incorporate the use of print media in the dissemi-
nation of HIV information to the public. This is because the
media is capable of preventing HIV transmission through its
capabilities to impart education through entertainment.
A review of literature also showed that in areas where the
government and other stakeholders have made an attempt to
use the mass media in the fight against the pandemic, very
little regard is given to the way in which this information is
covered. This has a lot of implications on the efforts to com-
bat the epidemic as it touches on several issues among them
being the credibility of the sources of information on HIV in
the print media, the amount of information on HIV covered
the frequency of coverage, as well as the style of presentation
of this information in the newspapers.
Shortcomings of the Print Media in
Combating HIV
Despite their potentially effective role in combating HIV, the
print media in Kenya have some shortcomings. These include
6 SAGE Open
the profit orientation of most media houses, which lead them
to focus on sensationalism, even in health topics, to increase
sales. Real public health issues therefore get very little cov-
erage. There is also lack of in-depth analysis that can help
communities to act on their health concerns as most stories
tend to give only general information to people. Journalists
should analyze health issues rather than just reporting them
routinely. There also exists a huge gap between health offi-
cials, researchers, and the print media. Some media houses,
for instance, are accused of relying more on politicians rather
than health officials who would provide them with accurate,
comprehensible, and credible information on HIV.
Reporters were also found to lack specialization and clear
understanding of issues relating to HIV, which causes them
to distort information sometimes with catastrophic results.
For example, it is argued that Kenyan journalists still refer to
PLWHIV as victims (African Woman and Child Feature
Service). The media could therefore address this issue by hir-
ing professional science editors who can report competently
on the subject of HIV.
It also emerged that the print media in Kenya still lacks
innovativeness in developing stories that can lead to behav-
ior change. They simply provide information, which does not
necessarily target specific populations at greater risk of
infection such as the youth, women, commercial sex workers
(CSWs) among others.
Other factors external to the workings of the media which
nevertheless negatively affect the media in combating HIV
are denial, stigma, and discrimination. In addition to strength-
ening the stigma, discrimination keeps many from seeking
information or help if they are infected, these beliefs pro-
mote denial, allowing many in society to distance themselves
from the realities of the epidemic, and therefore, to be lulled
into a false sense of security.
Sampling Procedures
All newspapers for the period under review were searched
for articles on HIV. The reviewed newspaper has daily and
weekend editions. There was no categorization in this
sense because all the newspapers within this period were
searched, irrespective of the day on which they were pub-
lished. Using this method, therefore, the researchers
searched all the newspapers in the year under the paper for
information on HIV. This information was in the form of
news items, opinions, editorials, features, letters to the edi-
tor, magazines, and research reports among others that had
subjects touching on HIV. The subjects of this information
included but were not limited to new medical discoveries,
government policies regarding HIV, financial assistance
toward fight against HIV, views of PLWHIV, religious per-
spectives, and any other issue concerning HIV. Any daily
or weekend edition of the newspaper with information on
HIV was included in the sample. Those which did not have
information on HIV were also part of the count. The
editorial policy of the newspaper was analyzed to give an
idea of the influence it might have on the writing on the
subject. Senior editors and writers explained about edito-
rial policy of the newspaper on such issues like HIV and
effects on writing about the subject, which illuminated on
the data collected quantitatively.
Data Analysis and Presentation
This research sought to analyze articles on HIV issues during
the specified period (January 1st to December 31st) in Kenya
appearing in the Daily Nation newspaper. In this respect the
following aspects were analyzed and coded accordingly. The
unit of analysis was an individual story (news story, feature,
and editorial, letter to editor or commentary) whose content
was be examined in terms of
·
· Number of articles,
·
· Their size (in cm2),
·
· Type (whether news, Opinion, feature, editorial, book
review, letter to editor, or advertisement),
·
· Placement (front page, page 2, page 3, other inside
pages, special feature/magazine section, or back
page),
·
· Prominence (edition lead, page lead, main editorial, or
special commentary),
·
· Main event (or occasion)
·
· Main actor (Government, NGO, the United Nations
system, PLWHIV), and
·
· Main subject.
The table (the main research instrument) was designed in
such a way as to ensure flawless entry of the data into a
microcomputer for analysis. The subsequent data aggrega-
tion and analysis was done using the SPSS computer soft-
ware and involved mainly charts to indicate associations and
differences in the treatment of HIV stories by the Daily
Nation newspaper.
Findings
The researchers used content analysis to collect data for this
paper. First, the process involved selecting a sample of 365
copies of Daily Nation newspapers. Once the researchers
selected a representative sample from the population, he
embarked on perusing them while looking for stories on HIV.
The process involved identifying the story; classifying them
into their respective categories, for example, a news item, a
feature story, an editorial, an advertising feature, news in
brief, opinion, letter to the editor, among others; measuring
the amount of space allocated for them in cubic centimeters;
and determining the source of the story, the placement of the
story in the newspaper, the number of stories in the newspa-
per, the main event, the intention of the story, and the origin,
that is, whether local or international.
Mogambi et al. 7
After collecting the data the researchers presented it in
different ways based on the type of interpretation that is
intended to the audience. The researchers made use of tables
and pie charts to present the data from the research. To meet
the objectives of this paper, the researchers focused on some
of the aspects from the findings in the process of analysis.
The aspects which the researchers analyzed include: number
and size of articles published every month of the year under
the paper, type of article and its frequency of coverage during
the year under the paper placement of the article in the news-
paper, themes covered in the article, and sources of the sto-
ries in the articles.
Number and Size of Articles Published
One of the objectives of this paper was to examine the amount
of space allocated to articles on HIV to determine the
prominence given to them in the print media. The number and
size of articles covered in a topic are some of the aspects of
the agenda setting theory of the mass media. It is evident that
if a topic is perceived by a news media as important, it will
frequently cover that topic as well as allocate substantial
amounts of space for them. In this way, the mass medium will
find a way to present to the public their views and how they
feel about the topic. It also plays a role in establishing a plat-
form to illustrate, discuss, or even debate an issue that a paper
wants to focus on creating, thus, a mass of public discussion.
From Charts 1 and 2, it is evident that December accounted
for the largest number of articles on HIV covered during the
year under this paper (27). The amount of space allocated to
the articles in this month was 15,912. This represented 30%
of all the space allocated to articles on HIV during the period
under review. This is mainly because the first day of
December of every year is World Aids Day and therefore the

Daily Nation dedicates a lot of their spaces to stories on HIV.
The Daily Nation had 27 articles on HIV on this particular
day during that year.
It emerged from the reviewed literature that most research-
ers are more concerned with the dissemination of information
on HIV to the targeted audience, without regard to how this
information is presented for it to be more effective in behavior
change. Examining the amount of space allocated to articles
on the epidemic as well as the frequency with which these
articles are published was therefore important in this paper.
The other phenomenon which is clear from Charts 1 and
2 is that the month of August accounts for only 1% of the
number of articles covered during the year under the paper.
This is mainly because the newspaper was preoccupied with
covering stories on the referendum as this was the month in
which Kenyans were to go on referendum over a new consti-
tution. It is also important to note that apart from the first day
of December, stories on HIV were covered on only 7 other
days within the month. On average, each of the other months
(apart from December and August) had an average of 7.8%
of the total number of articles covering HIV.
From this pattern of coverage, it is clear that the print
media in Kenya lacks consistency in the coverage of HIV
issues. The extreme variation in the frequency of coverage as
well as the space allocated to articles on HIV during the
period under the paper is an indication that the print media
organizations in Kenya lack a clear editorial policy on the
coverage of information on the epidemic.
Types of Articles
Journalists distinguish between hard news and soft news
(Curran, Douglas, & Whannel, 1980). Soft news generally
deals with the less serious news, such as news about person-
alities or celebrities, human interest, or gossip. Hard news
generally concerns the more serious news with such salient
foci as those of high rank in government or other institutional
hierarchies, news of events which affect large numbers of
people, or news which possesses national or international
significance for the past or future.
From this paper, it appeared that the majority of the arti-
cles were in the soft news category. This is because most of
them were not accorded much salience in terms of place-
ment, size, and frequency with which they occurred during
the period under the paper.
The articles on HIV were categorized into six groups.
These included news, editorials, opinions and letters to the
editor, brief news, and special reports (features [news fea-
tures and advertisement features] and reports). The number
of each of the categories was represented in Table 1.
The majority of articles from the content analysis were news
items which accounted for 44% of all the sampled articles. This
is significant as it shows that the journalists in the media house
strove to publish as many news items as possible during the
year under the paper. It is also an indication of the importance
with which the media house regards issues on HIV. It was also
important that the news items be examined closely for aspects
such as adherence to journalistic ethics and codes.
This was followed by special reports, which accounted
for 35% of all the sampled articles. In this research special
reports included reports from research, news features, adver-
tisement features, and magazines. Special reports are a sig-
nificant category of articles in a newspaper in that they not
only give an in-depth analysis of issues but they also allocate
big amounts of space to the articles.
Opinion articles represented 7% of the sampled articles.
Articles in this category included analyses by writers of the
Daily Nation as well as commentaries by guest writers.
Although it may be argued that guest commentators' views
do not represent those of the media house, it is also accept-
able to argue that by sanctioning a publication, the editor, by
implication, indicates that she or he agrees with it, and con-
sequently, takes responsibility of the contents thereof. Brief
news accounted for 6% of all the articles sampled.
Finally, editorials and letters accounted for 5% and 3%,
respectively. Editorials are also effective in the agenda set-
ting theory of the mass media in that they are articles written
or approved by the editor, which gives a newspaper's views
on a current topic. With only 5% of the articles being editori-
als during the year under the paper, it is evidently clear that
the media house has not done enough in giving its views and
position on the issue of HIV. It is also an indication that other
issues are given salience over HIV by the print media.
Letters to the editor also play an important role in the fight
against HIV in that it offers a platform for the general public to
air their views to the media house on issues regarding the epi-
demic. From the paper, it was found out that letters to the edi-
tor accounted for only 3% of all the articles on HIV. This is
considered too little because the public views on the epidemic
are also important if the war on the epidemic is to be won. The
small percentage of the letters to the editor could also be an
indication that the readers of the print media do not find arti-
cles on HIV interesting, and consequently, they are not moti-
vated to respond to the articles on HIV in the newspaper.

Placement of Articles
Placement is another very important aspect in the agenda set-
ting function of the mass media. Placement refers to the posi-
tion of an article in the newspaper. The aspect of placement
is important in that it is an indication of the importance of the
topic in the article. Some of the most important positions in
a newspaper are considered to be the first, second, third, and
the back page of the newspaper. When an article is placed in
these pages, it facilitates rapid reading as it helps the reader
to get a glance of what he wants to know. Placement of arti-
cles in these pages has the potential of attracting the readers'
attention. Buckler and Travis (2005) argue that newspaper
editors, in their agenda setting role, consider the front page
stories the most important ones of the day and therefore the
ones that entice the largest audience.
From the content analysis carried out on the Daily Nation
newspaper, the writer found the placement of stories on HIV
as shown in Table 2.
From the above table, it is evident that articles on HIV
were not placed as much as possible in the pages considered
to be prominent in the newspaper during the period under
paper. This was a serious omission on the part of the newspa-
per given the importance of the subject under discussion.
From the paper, the researchers found out that only one story
appeared in the front page of the Daily Nation newspaper in
the period reviewed. Only one story also appeared in the
back page of the newspaper during the year under the paper.
Placement in the second and third place was, however, much
better, with six articles appearing in these pages in the period
under the paper.
Apart from the most prominent pages mentioned above,
placement of articles in magazines, special report pages, and
pullouts and features is also important as it shows the seri-
ousness with which the newspaper treats the topics in the
articles. This is because the articles are treated not only
exclusively in most of these publications but are also
accorded substantial amounts of space. In this respect, the
Daily Nation newspaper scored highly in that most articles
on HIV were covered in form of news features, special
reports, advertisement features as well as magazines such as
"Living Magazine" among others.
Themes Covered in the Articles
Theme in this paper has been used to refer to the main sub-
ject of the article published in the articles. This may also be
used to refer to the major aim of the writer of the article.
In this paper, it was found out that most of the articles had
themes on discoveries made in HIV treatment, achievements
which have so far been made in the fight against the HIV
pandemic, government policies and legislations on HIV, IEC
on HIV, appeals made by groups and individuals in the fight
against HIV, activities geared toward combating the epi-
demic, personal views of PLWHIV, obstacles faced in the
fight against Aids, issues surrounding funding for combating
the epidemic, and others. The pie chart (Chart 3) is a sum-
mary of the themes covered in the articles in the year under
the paper.
Lack of Detailed Knowledge
The findings of this paper concurs with the argument that in
many parts of Africa, Kenya included, there is widespread
awareness of HIV which coexists with highly skewed
detailed knowledge (Caldwell, 1999). Most of the articles on
HIV in the period under the paper revolved around govern-
ment policies and legislations on HIV (15%), achievements
made in the fight against HIV (14%), and views of PLWHIV
(14%). Articles on IEC were a paltry 8%.
Main Actors in the News
Main actor refers to the main source of the news for the arti-
cle. In communication, and in particular health communica-
tion, the source of the information to be passed across to the
audience will determine how the message will be received by
the audience. One of the most commonly considered source
factors is source credibility. This aspect has two primary
dimensions; expertise and trustworthiness (Berlo, Lemart, &
Mertz, 1969).
Research shows that expert sources are generally more
persuasive than those lacking expertise and the relationship
between trustworthiness and persuasion is also generally
positive (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken, 1978). Furthermore,
effects of source expertise and trustworthiness are often con-
text dependent.
Research has also shown that inaccurate information can
affect the success of preventive initiatives, like health cam-
paigns. It is therefore, important to examine where journal-
ists obtain HIV information. In this research, sources were
categorized into eight groups, namely: journalists, health
experts, and GOK, Unite nations, NGO, PLWHIV, guest
commentators, and others. These can be represented as in the
Table 3.

The State
The state in this research has been used to refer to the sources
of news from government. These may include health minis-
ters, Secretaries in the ministry of health, officials in the
Kenya Medical Research Institute, and other government
officials, who are authorized to comment on issues regarding
HIV. Most of the state sources in this research gave news on
issues regarding achievements, which have so far been
achieved by the government in the fight against the epidemic,
government policies and legislations regarding HIV, and IEC
materials by the ministry of health, among other issues. In
this paper, the state sources accounted for 22% of all the
articles on HIV in the year under the paper.
Health Experts
The term health expert in this paper has been used to refer to
individuals who are qualified to provide health care. These may
include doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. It also refers to
researchers in the field of medicine. One of the objectives of
this paper was to examine the articles to determine the exper-
tise of the sources of information on HIV. Previous researchers
have noted that expert sources are generally more persuasive
than those lacking in expertise. Therefore, the importance of
using expert sources in disseminating information on HIV can-
not be overemphasized. In this regard, the print media did fairly
well in the use of expert sources in the dissemination of infor-
mation regarding new discoveries made in the management of
HIV and educating the public on prevention measures.
PLWHIV
The involvement of PLWHIV in the dissemination of informa-
tion on HIV is also very important in that the media gives them
a platform on which to air their views on such issues. PLWHIV
are people who keep looking for solutions and require daily
experience from resolving psychological and social problems
associated with their HIV status. The solutions discovered by
PLWHIV today can be used in future for others who face the
same problem. Therefore, their full involvement and participa-
tion in design, planning, implementation, and evaluation of
programs is crucial to the development of effective responses
to the HIV epidemic. In this paper, however, articles whose
sources are PLWHIV account for only 15% of all the articles
on HIV in the year under the paper. It is also worth noting that
most of the articles by PLWHIV are concentrated on one per-
son living with the HIV virus. This is a feature in form of a
diary, in which AsuntaWagura, a person living with HIV who
had publicly declared her HIV positive status several years
ago, writes informative articles on her experiences as a person
living with HIV. In this column, she advises, educates, and
counsels the general public on issues about HIV. Though this
is a positive step by the Daily Nation newspaper, it would be
better if journalists get the views of various PLWHIV as they
have different experiences.
Journalists
In this paper, the articles by the journalists account for 18%
of all the articles on HIV in the year under the paper. This

is an indication of many issues surrounding the reporting of
HIV information by the journalists. First, it points out to the
fact that most journalists lack appropriate training in mat-
ters concerning HIV and so most of them shy away from
the task of investigating and writing stories on HIV. As a
result of this therefore, they rely on a wide array of sources
to provide quotes, background information, explanations of
complex aspects or technical details. It also implies that
journalists are constrained by time and resources in most of
the print media houses.
NGOs
In this paper, the term nongovernmental organization (NGO)
has been used to refer to any nonprofit, voluntary citizens'
group, which is organized on a local, national, or interna-
tional level. They are task-oriented and driven by people
with a common interest and perform a variety of service and
humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to govern-
ments, advocate and monitor policies, and encourage politi-
cal participation through provision of information. Some are
organized around specific issues, such as human rights, envi-
ronment, or health. They provide analysis and expertise,
serve as early warning mechanisms and help monitor and
implement international agreements. The paper only focused
on those NGOs organized around health issues, and in par-
ticular HIV.
In this paper, NGOs accounted for 8% of all the sources of
information on HIV during the period under the paper. This
was rather less given the major role played by the NGOs in
the fight against the epidemic. By limiting the number of
articles from these organizations, the journalists and by
extension the audiences eventually miss out on important
aspects, such as expertise in research and analysis of issues
on HIV, which would have been provided by the NGOs.
Framing of HIV Stories
The concept of framing is related to the agenda setting tra-
dition but expands the research by focusing on the essence
of the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. The
basis of framing theory is that the media focuses attention
on certain events and then places them within a field of
meaning. Framing is an important topic because it can
have a big influence on the interpretation of messages in
articles by the audience.
In this paper, the researchers focused on how the journal-
ists framed articles on HIV with a view of determining the
effectiveness of the articles in disseminating information on
HIV to the target audience. The choice of language by jour-
nalists is one of the most important elements of framing. This
is because language helps us to remember information and
acts to transform the way in which we view situations.
From the findings of this paper, despite the efforts that
journalists put in covering information on HIV, their choice
of words was not appropriate in some of the articles. This
concurs with the views raised by a research done by the
African Woman and Child Feature Service. They argue that
journalists lack specialization in the area of HIV. For
instance, the journalists seemed to have overused the term
AIDS instead of HIV. From the findings, some of the titles
of articles read, "Kenya misses out on AIDS drugs" (Daily
Nation, Wednesday, February 17, 2010), "Cash hitch won't
delay AIDS drugs" (Daily Nation, Wednesday, February
21, 2010), "Aids patients wait for verdict on drugs law"
(Daily Nation, Friday, March 19, 2010). These are just a
few examples of instances where journalists substituted the
term HIV with AIDS.
The above examples are an indication that journalists in
the Kenyan print media are not well versed in the terminol-
ogy of HIV. Instead of sensitizing their target audiences with
accurate information on HIV, they end up creating miscon-
ceptions on the epidemic.
Among the key findings of this paper is that print media
in Kenya lacks consistency in reporting issues on HIV. It
was found out that articles on HIV are at their peak during
events such as World AIDS Day, government reports on
the progress so far made in the fight against the epidemic,
as well as sponsorships by different organizations in the
fight against the epidemic. The number of articles then
decline in other periods as the print media focus on issues
other than the epidemic. Other findings from the paper
include the fact that the print media in Kenya has not done
very well in placement of articles on HIV in the newspa-
per. It was found out, for instance, that during the entire
period under the paper, only one article on HIV made it to
the front page, which is considered the most prominent
page of a newspaper. This was considered as a serious
lapse on the part of the newspaper editors as it is an indica-
tion that issues on HIV are not given the attention and
prominence that they deserve.
Conclusion
The print media in Kenya was found to be lacking in consis-
tency in reporting HIV issues. At times, it is flooded with
articles on HIV, and then there are longer periods when it is
silent on the issue. What often spurs the print media coverage
of the epidemic were found to be events such as announce-
ments by the government and other stakeholders on the
achievements so far made in combating the epidemic, new
discoveries made in the treatment and management of HIV
as well as features revolving around PLWHIV. Articles on
these themes and others were also found to be concentrated
in the month of December. This is mainly because most of
the coverage in December is based on sponsorships and pub-
lic campaigns to mark the World AIDS Day event, which is
observed on 1st of December annually. This is an indication
that there is lack of drive in the print media organizations in
Kenya to address the epidemic.
12 SAGE Open
Though there are a fairly good number of articles on HIV
in some of the months in the year under study, the amount of
column space allocated to them might not be proportionate to
the weight which the epidemic carries. The importance of an
issue is normally judged by the amount of column space allo-
cated to it among other aspects such as placement and the
frequency with which it occurs in the newspaper. The print
media can do better by allocating enough space to articles on
the epidemic. It has been acknowledged through research
that media managers will not give regular coverage to HIV
issues if there is no reader interest. This paper found that
most articles on the epidemic were poorly displayed and
tucked away in the inside pages of the newspaper.
Another lapse is that there are only a very limited number
of articles in form of letters to the editor. This scenario is an
indication of either lack of interest on the part of the general
readership to contribute on matters concerning the epidemic
or the editors do not publish adequate number of letters from
the general public. Involving the general public in the fight
against the epidemic is very important.
The paper also found out that only a few articles on HIV
(8%) contained detailed knowledge on HIV. These were in
form of IEC materials. This finding concurs with then asser-
tion that there exists a widespread awareness on HIV, but this
knowledge coexists with highly skewed detailed knowledge.
According to Caldwell (1999), the demographic and health
surveys conducted during the 1990s in Tanzania, Kenya, and
Zambia indicated that knowledge of the disease was almost
universal but very few people were aware of or believed in
the protection offered by condoms.
Based on the findings of this paper, it can be argued that
print media in Kenya still has a generally low and temporary
coverage of HIV issues on print media. This kind of cover-
age cannot therefore create the necessary input in terms of
awareness and change in behavior in tackling HIV.
