Rationale: Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) causes increased mortality in the general population. But life expectancy and the years
of life lost have not been reported.
Objectives: To quantify mortality, examine how it varies with age, sex, and other risk factors,
and determine how life expectancy is affected.
Methods: We constructed mortality models using the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, adjusting for age, sex, race, and major medical conditions. We used these
to compute life expectancy and the years of life lost.
Measurements and main results: Pulmonary function testing classified patients as having
Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 COPD or restriction.
COPD is associated with only a modest reduction in life expectancy for never smokers, but
with a very large reduction for current and former smokers. At age 65, the reductions in male
life expectancy for stage 1, stage 2, and stages 3 or 4 disease in current smokers are 0.3 years,
2.2 years, and 5.8 years. These are in addition to the 3.5 years lost due to smoking. In former
smokers the reductions are 1.4 years and 5.6 years for stage 2 and stages 3 or 4 disease, and in
never smokers they are 0.7 and 1.3 years.
Conclusions: Persons with COPD have an increased risk of mortality compared to those who
do not, with consequent reduction in life expectancy. The effect is most marked in current
smokers, and this is further reason for smokers to quit.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease where
airways in the lungs are damaged. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States and around the world.1­8 In the United States, COPD was responsible
for over 120,000 deaths in 2004 and is the only cause of death in the top five to have
been increasing since 1990.9 Prevalence estimates in the United States range from 10
to 16 million adults, but the condition may be under-diagnosed.10,11 The overall attribut-
able morbidity and mortality from COPD may, therefore, be underestimated.
Risk factors for COPD include genetic factors and environmental exposures. The
major exposures are tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, and pollution.12
In industrialized nations, tobacco smoke is the biggest risk factor, where up to 50%
of long-term smokers will develop COPD,13 while in less industrialized nations it is
exposure to air pollution.14 Conversely, of persons with COPD in the western world,
roughly 50% have smoking as the underlying etiology.13 Symptoms generally emerge
after age 40, but can manifest earlier.
Mannino and colleagues4 analyzed data from the First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I), using a modified version of the Global Initiative
International Journal of COPD 2009:4
138
Shavelle et al
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria for
COPD and other respiratory disease in that population. The
authors reported all-cause mortality relative risks (RRs)
for COPD based on multivariable models that controlled
for smoking status, pack-year history, years since last
regularly smoked, body mass index (BMI), and a number of
demographic variables. The RRs ranged from 1.2 for mild
COPD to 1.7 for severe. Some other studies also reported
RRs based on severity.2,7,15,16 To our knowledge, however,
no studies have reported life expectancies in COPD, or the
years of life lost.
Our primary goal was to compute life expectancy and the
years of life lost due to COPD. To do so we required quantifi-
cation of the excess mortality associated with COPD. We thus
sought to calculate the associated excess death rates (EDRs)
and RRs, and to investigate whether these varied by age, sex,
race, education, smoking status, the presence of concomitant
medical conditions, and time since evaluation. We were
particularly interested in how the RRs varied with age, as we
have found in other chronic conditions that it declines with
age.17,18 Using the aforementioned results, we then computed
life expectancies for the various groups, in order to determine
the years of life lost due to COPD. As noted, these quantities
have not been reported in the literature.
Methods
Study population
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted 1988 to 1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics on a nationwide probability
sample of 33,994 persons aged two months and older through
interviews and direct physical examinations.19,20 To focus on
the effects of COPD in an older population, we restricted
attention to the 6,261 adults over age 50 who had a reliable
or reproducible pulmonary test and smoking history (except
as noted below). Of these persons, 3,555 were smokers or
former smokers and 3,362 had pack-year history. Pipe or
cigar smokers were counted as current or former smokers
as appropriate, but we did not have pack year history on
these persons.
Measurements
Examiners used either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the
mobile examination center or a portable spirometer in the
home examination to conduct pulmonary function testing.
Testing procedures were based on the 1987 American
Thoracic Society recommendation.21 Subjects performed 5
to 8 forced expirations in order to obtain acceptable protocol
curves. Predicted forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV
1
) was calculated using previously published prediction
equations from the NHANES III data, stratified by sex, age,
and race.22­25 Persons were considered as having COPD only
if confirmed by pulmonary function testing. Otherwise they
were assumed to have no lung disease (Normal) or GOLD
stage 0 if they reported respiratory symptoms. The severity
scale for COPD used by Mannino and colleagues4 and in the
present study is shown in Figure 1.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using the statistical package SAS
9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).26 Kaplan­Meier
survival curves were produced for various groups.27 Cox
proportional hazards regression models were developed
using the "PROC PHREG" procedure in SAS. These models
provide hazard ratios (or, equivalently, RRs) for each
potential mortality risk factor. The variables included in one
or more of the multivariable regression models were: Age,
sex, race, smoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking,
BMI, major medical conditions, and lung function (COPD)
category. The models were used to compute mortality rates
for various groups, including 65 year-old males with the
given severities of COPD. The difference between a given
rate and the corresponding general population (or other
baseline) mortality rate is the EDR, which were computed
for the various groups.
Life expectancies were computed for the same groups by
using the above mortality rates to construct a life table.28­30
A remaining issue was the imputation of some mortality
rates. When the EDR was positive (increased risk compared
with the general population), the assumption of proportional
life expectancy (PLE)18,29 was used to obtain the mortality
rates at older ages. In brief, this method assumes that the
proportion of normal life expectancy for a given medical
condition is the same at every age.18,29 For example, if the
life expectancy in mild COPD is 90% of normal at age 50,
then under PLE it would be 90% of normal at age 70 as well.
When the EDR was negative, it was assumed to approach
zero with age, much as persons in above-average health
revert to the mean.
Results
The mean duration of follow-up of the 6,261 persons studied
was 7.9 years (with standard deviation 2.8 years), and there
were 1,873 deaths. Table 1 shows the baseline demographic
characteristics of the cohort. Overall, the percentages of
persons with spirometric evidence of COPD were: GOLD
International Journal of COPD 2009:4 139
Life expectancy in COPD
stage 1: 16%, GOLD stage 2: 12%, GOLD stage 3 or 4: 3%,
and restriction: 8%.
Figures 2­5 show the Kaplan­Meier survival curves
based on severity of COPD, both for the entire population and
stratified by smoking status. In all cases, any lung function
impairment was associated with an increased risk of death.
These curves were used to compute the (crude) EDRs
associated with COPD that are shown in Table 2. For
example, amongst smokers, the 10-year survival probability
persons with no lung disease was 75%, compared with 65%
for persons with COPD symptoms, 63% for stage 1, 58%
for stage 2, and approximately 15% for stage 3 or 4. The
associated annual mortality rate over the 10-year period for
smokers with no lung disease is thus ­ln(0.75)/10 = 0.0288.
For stages 1, 2, and 3 or 4 COPD, the rates are 0.0462, 0.0545,
and 0.1897, respectively. Thus, the EDR over the 10-year
period for smokers with stage 1 COPD, compared with
smokers with no lung disease, is 0.0462 - 0.0288 = 0.0174.
For stages 2 and 3 or 4 COPD, the EDRs are higher, 0.0257
and 0.1609, respectively. EDRs for all 24 groups are shown
in Table 2. It is important to note that these are crude EDRs,
unadjusted for any possible confounding factors.
The EDRs implicit in the "All" group in Figure 2 of
Mannino and colleagues4 are roughly one-third lower than
those reported in Table 2 here. The reason is that the EDR
increases with age, and the Mannino and colleagues study
population was significantly younger than the population
used here: unlike the present study, half their population was
under age 50 at the start of follow-up.
Additional analyses (not shown) indicated that persons
with COPD, compared to those without lung disease, tended
to be older and male, and of course were much more likely
to be smokers. It is important to note that the survival curves
in Figures 2­5 were not adjusted for any of the covari-
ates. Thus, the EDRs given in Table 2 may be confounded
with the effects of these covariates. We wished to obtain
an unconfounded (or pure) estimate of the EDRs or RRs
associated with COPD. For this we required multivariate

classified as GOLD stage 0 (if they reported symptoms) or Normal (if they reported no symptoms). Persons who had a positive response to (a) having a cough for three
consecutive months out of the year, (b) phlegm first-thing in the morning three consecutive months out of the year, or (c) wheezing in the past 12 months, were considered
as having GOLD stage 0 if their pulmonary function testing did not indicate COPD or RLD.

statistical methods, such as the Cox proportional hazards
regression model.
Cox models were used to adjust for age, sex, race,
education, smoking status, smoking history, weight, and major
medical conditions. The variables, their various levels, and the
associated relative risks of mortality are shown in Table 3.
As expected, the relative risks associated with COPD
increased with increasing severity of COPD. In all cases the
relative ordering of severity was preserved in the resulting
RRs. However, as can be seen, the stage 1 group had a relative
risk that, in 3 of the 4 cases, was actually less than that of the
reference group (stage 0), though the differences were neither
practically nor statistically significant. We return to this issue
in the discussion. Those with restrictive lung disease (RLD)
or symptoms of COPD, but no formal diagnosis, both had
uniformly increased risk of death compared with those with
no lung disease.
Other analyses (not shown), using models that (a)
accounted for only age, sex, and COPD, and (b) were based
on different subsets of data, yielded similar results. Separate
International Journal of COPD 2009:4 141
Life expectancy in COPD
analysis of pipe and cigar smokers (not shown) revealed that
their mortality risk was similar to that of smokers (RR = 1.0),
and higher than that of former smokers (RR = 1.1).
Further analyses (not shown) revealed that the effect
of COPD did not appear to vary by sex, race, or college
education. That is, there were no significant interactions. But it
did vary by age, as we hypothesized, with older persons having
a lower RR than younger persons (results not shown). This
was true for those with stage 2 and 3 or 4 COPD, and amongst
current, former, and never smokers, with one exception (it did
not hold for the former smokers with moderate COPD). We
comment further on this issue in the discussion.

college education, no lung disease, never smoker (first model
only), low pack-years of smoking (models 1­3 only), normal
weight, and no other medical conditions. As can be seen,
even "healthy" current smokers, with low pack-years, have
a baseline mortality rate that is much higher than the never
smokers (0.0103 vs. 0.0041). By comparison, we note that
the corresponding annual mortality rates at age 55 for the
United States female general population28 and the insured
population (at time of underwriting)31 are 0.0048 and 0.0009,
respectively. That is, the best group contemplated by the
models is slightly better than the general population, but does
not have mortality as low as the recently insured (who have
additionally demonstrated normal blood work, urinalysis,
and electrocardiogram).

in the model. For example, using the "All" group, the
mortality rate for a 75 year-old male, Caucasian, no college
education, no lung disease, smoker, medium pack-years,
normal weight, with no medical conditions is 0.0060 * 1.3 *
1.0 * 1.2 * 4.5 * 1.0 * 1.5 * 1.1 * 1.0 = 0.0695.
We used the model of Table 3 to compute mortality rates
for various groups of 65-year-old Caucasian males with col-
lege education, normal weight, and no medical conditions
(for the smoking groups we assumed low pack-years, and
for the "all" group we assumed "never smoker"). These rates
are shown in Table 4.
We computed the EDRs implicit in Table 4 by subtracting
from each the US male general population mortality rate at
age 65 (0.0186). The resulting EDRs are shown in Table 5.
As can be seen, these are smaller than the EDRs of Table 2
for the "all", former, and never groups, and higher for some
of the smoking groups. Otherwise, there is no clear pattern.
That the EDRs would differ between the tables is under-
standable, as the former are crude (or possibly confounded)
while the latter are at least partially adjusted for the factors
in the models of Table 3 (that is, computed after controlling
for the factors in the models, including having no medical
conditions).
Implicit in Table 5 is the observation that the EDRs
for COPD are higher for smokers than for nonsmokers or
never smokers. For example, within current smokers, the
EDR for stage 3 or 4 COPD compared with mild COPD is
0.0601 - 0.0109 = 0.0492 whereas for never smokers it is
only 0.0010 - (-0.0077) = 0.0087. This is one example of
"super-additivity", where the risk associated with two factors
(here, smoking and COPD) is greater than the sum of the
separate risks associated with these factors. Super-additivity
is also seen, for example, with respect to smoking and dia-
betes. We return to this issue in the discussion.
We next used the rates of Table 4 to compute life
expectancies for the 24 (male) groups. The indicated rates

Notes: aThe respective reference groups for these relative risks are persons who are:
female, non-Caucasian, college education, aged 50­59, no lung disease, never smoker
(for the first model), low pack-years (for the first three models), normal weight, and
without any of the specified medical conditions. bThis the mortality rate for persons
in the reference group described immediately above. It is computed by setting the
values of the covariates (variables) in the respective models equal to zero.

were used for age 65. Because we found that the RR decreases
with age (and the EDR increases with age), an assumption
of constant EDR or constant RR with age was not war-
ranted. Of course we could have used the model of Table 3
International Journal of COPD 2009:4
144
Shavelle et al
to compute mortality rates at all ages. Yet, as just noted, the
RR decreases with age. Thus, using model-based rates at all
ages would overestimate mortality and, thus, underestimate
life expectancy. We opted to take a middle position: the use
of proportional life expectancy (PLE).18,29 It can be shown
that this method has implications for the EDR at every
age,18,29 upon which it follows that our approach here could
rely equally on the rates of Table 4 or the EDRs of Table 5.
For females, the corresponding mortality rates are shown in
Table 6, and the EDRs in Table 7.
Life expectancies based on the rates of Tables 4 and 5
are given in Table 8. As can be seen, the best group ­ never
smokers with no significant lung disease and no medical
conditions ­ have a life expectancy of 17.8 additional years.
Not surprisingly, this is higher than the corresponding figure
in the United States general population (16.8 years). By
contrast, current smokers with no lung disease have a life
expectancy of 14.3 years, or 3.5 years lower than 17.8, similar
to the finding of Doll and colleagues.32 As expected, the
presence of COPD further decreases the life expectancy.
Currentsmokerswithstage1COPDhavealifeexpectancy
of 14.0 years, or 0.3 years lower. Smokers with stage 2 COPD
have a life expectancy of 12.1 years, or 2.2 years lower.
Those with stage 3 or 4 COPD have a life expectancy of
8.5 years, or 5.8 years lower. Former smokers lose 0.5 years
for smoking, 1.4 additional years for stage 2 COPD and
5.6 additional years for stage 3 or 4 COPD, compared with
otherwise similar persons who do not have lung disease.
By contrast, never smokers lose only 0.7 years for stage 2
COPD and 1.3 years for stages 3 or 4 COPD. The two cases
with an increase in life expectancy for COPD compared
with no lung disease (stage 1 COPD in former and never
smokers) are undoubtedly both due to the comparatively
large standard errors (not shown) in the respective stage 1
parameter estimates of Table 3. The standard errors are much
smaller for the other parameters. In sum, the years of life
lost due to stages 2, 3, or 4 COPD is significant in current
and former smokers, and modest in nonsmokers and those
with stage 1 COPD.
Table 9 shows the corresponding values for females (using
the mortality rates in Table 6 or the EDRs in Table 7). As
with males, the reductions in life expectancy are significant
for both smokers and those with stage 2, 3, or 4 COPD. For
example, never smokers with stage 3 or 4 COPD lose 1.9 years
of life, while smokers with stage 3 or 4 COPD lose 9.0 years,
or 44% of the 20.3 years that obtains for a never smoker with
no lung disease. The life expectancies in Tables 8 and 9 are
shown graphically in Figures 6 and 7.

Life expectancy in COPD
As noted, the models of Table 3 can be used to compute
mortalityrates,andthuslifeexpectancies,foranycombinations
of the covariates. We could thus construct tables similar
to Tables 8 and 9 for persons aged 55 or 75, or those with
diabetes.
Discussion
Although the number of persons with COPD seems unusu-
ally high compared to other published reports (31% vs
15%),12 our population was comparatively older, and oth-
ers have noted that COPD is generally underdiagnosed in
the general population.10­11 Persons who exhibit no signs
or symptoms of abnormal lung function are unlikely to be
tested by spirometry, and thus are unlikely to be diagnosed
with COPD. Another possible reason for the high number
of persons with COPD could be related to the fact that
persons who are older will naturally have a lower lung
function compared to their younger counterparts. While
Hankinson and colleagues22 attempted to account for this
in their regression model for adults, it is possible that a
single equation for all adults may not properly estimate the
predicted FEV
1
and forced vital capacity (FVC) at older
ages. Thus, persons who actually might have normal lung
function for their age might incorrectly be placed into the
category of mild COPD. The effect of this is to dilute the
relative risks for older persons with mild COPD, and in fact
may account for the nonsignificant relative risk for mild
COPD that we found.
Mannino and colleagues4 reported a relative risk of 1.2
for mild COPD. This was higher than the RRs we found
(which were very close to 1.0). Their data (NHANES I)
spanned 30 years of follow-up, while ours (NHANES III)
spanned only 12. Perhaps, in the intervening 18 years, persons
with mild COPD went on to develop more serious COPD.
Hoogendern and colleagues33 studied the issue of COPD
progression. They reported annual transition rates from mild
to moderate COPD of 1.8%, 2.1% and 2.5% for nonsmokers,
former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. For
moderate to severe COPD the rates were 3.0%, 3.4%, and
3.7%, respectively. Over a 12-year period, therefore, at least
22% [= 100% ­ (100% - 2%)^12] would progress, and
therefore be subject to an increased relative risk.
The excess risk in COPD increases with the severity of
COPD. These findings have been replicated across several
databases, and by many research groups. We comment here
on four such studies.
1. Lee and colleagues,15 in analyzing the Health and
Retirement Survey data, reported an odds ratio of 2.3 for
persons with lung disease even after adjusting for age,
sex, co-morbidities, and functional measures (bathing,
managing finances, etc). Our values are mostly lower,
likely due to our study population being older (see
discussion below about the effect of advancing age).
2. Ekberg-Aronsson and colleagues2 reported relative risks
by gender and smoking status. They found relative risks
of 2.4 and 3.6 for male smokers in the GOLD stage 3 or

4 categories but who otherwise had no other co-morbidity.
These RRs are higher than those we reported, but this is
primarily due to the lower baseline mortality rate in their
study. When we restricted attention to similar groups, we
found similar results (not shown).
3. Celli and colleagues16 used a different measure of COPD,
the BODE index, which is a "multidimensional grading
system that assessed the respiratory, perceptive, and
systemic aspects of COPD that would better categorize
the illness and predict the outcome than does the FEV
1
alone." The index includes consideration of BMI, airflow
obstruction (based on predicted FEV
1
), dyspnea, and
exercise capacity to determine classification of severity
in COPD. The authors found a 32% increased risk of
death for each point increase in the index.
4. Singer7 compared the results of Celli and colleagues16
to three older studies. Dividing the BODE index into
quartiles, he found mortality ratios of 1.41, 2.76, 3.74, and
8.29. He concluded that while FEV
1
might be the strongest
predictorofmortality,theotherthreefactors(BMI,severity
of dyspnea, and exercise capacity) were sufficiently able to
refine the levels of excess mortality. He also concluded that
the BODE index may be a useful predictor in determining
the statistical likelihood of survival in populations that
have all four of the index measures. He noted, however,
that in most cases the severity of dyspnea and exercise
capacity are not available.
It is well known that COPD reduces life expectancy. As
was documented here, the reduction is significant for those
with severe disease (GOLD State 3 or 4) and for smokers.
The new findings reported here are the relative risks of
Table 3, the mortality and excess death rates of Tables 4­7,
and the life expectancies of Tables 8 and 9. The latter were
used to document the years of life lost due to COPD and/or
smoking. We also found (1) that the relative risk appears to
decrease with age, and (2) the presence of super-additivity.
We now comment on these latter two issues.
As is well known, once the schedule of age-specific
mortality rates is known, a life table can be constructed and
the life expectancy determined.29,30 It might seem reasonable,
then, to use the model shown in Table 3 to calculate mortality
rates for any combination of factors, especially for persons
with COPD. To do so would overlook two issues, however.
First, the RRs of Table 3 apply to all combinations of
the risk factors, and do not appear to vary significantly by
sex, race, education, and so on. But, as we have shown,
they do vary by age. Thus, the relative risks reported in the
Table are truly average RRs over the age-span. It might be

Life expectancy in COPD
reasonable, therefore, to assume that the relative risk applies
at the average follow-up age (68 + 12/2), with possibly an
additional offset to account for the variability.34,35
Second, one must specify the severity of COPD. As we
have noted above, this cannot be assumed to remain static
over the lifetime. A plausible simplifying assumption might
be to assume that the EDR for the given severity applies at
the initial age, and that this EDR increases in some fashion
with age.18,29
The results shown in Tables 3, 5, and 7 confirm that the
effect of COPD is super-additive with respect to smoking.
That is, the extra risk due to COPD is higher in smokers than
in nonsmokers. The effect is also super-additive with respect
to age, as the EDR (but not RR) increases with age.
Life insurance underwriters implicitly assume super-
additivity whenever they apply the same RR (or rating) to a
smoker that they would to a nonsmoker. With a higher baseline
mortalityrateforsmokers,theresultingEDRfortheconditionto
be rated will be larger than the EDR for nonsmokers. If it is true
that smoking increases the mortality effect of every risk factor
(such as COPD), then this assumption appears reasonable.
It is important to note that a multiplicative model such as
the Cox proportional hazards regression model is predicated
upon super-additivity (actually, it assumes that the hazards
are multiplicative, rather than additive). Further discussion is
beyond the scope of the present article, but we hope to soon
report on this issue in more detail.
As we have seen, COPD is associated with increased
mortality and, thus, with reduced life expectancy. Those with
stage 1 or 2 COPD lose at most a few years of life expectancy
at age 65 compared with persons with no lung disease, in
addition to any years lost due to smoking. But current smokers
with stage 3 or 4 COPD lose about six years of life expectancy,
in addition to the almost four years lost due to smoking.
