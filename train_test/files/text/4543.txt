ABSTRACT
This study is aimed to conduct a systematic literature review
regarding the associations between psychiatric symptoms,
functional impairments, and quality of life in patients with
CMT (Charcot­Marie­Tooth). The PUBMED, PsycInfo, SCIELO,
and LILACS electronic databases were used, and the follow-
ing search terms were employed: CMT, HMSN (hereditary
motor and sensory neuropathy), mental disorder, quality of
life, psychiatry, psychiatric, and psychological without the
use of time-limit filters. According to the adopted inclusion
criteria, 20 studies were included and appraised. These stud-
ies indicated that patients with CMT exhibited an increased
trend toward depressive symptoms compared with the gen-
eral population. In addition, CMT patients were exposed to
a higher risk of reduced quality of life and significant sleep
impairment. Considering the comorbidity of CMT with other
psychiatric disorders, the heterogeneity of the instruments
used to evaluate the psychiatric symptoms compromised the
ability to compare the studies examined. Our results indicate
aneedforasystematicevaluationoftheseconditionstomin-
imize the impairments and decreased quality of life caused by
CMT.
Key words: Charcot­Marie­Tooth, comorbidity, hereditary
motor sensory neuropathy, mental disorder, psychiatry, qual-
ity of life.

CMT (CHARCOT­MARIE­TOOTH):
CLINICAL ASPECTS
CMT disease or HMSN (hereditary motor and sensory neu-
ropathy) is the most common inherited disease of the PNS
(peripheral nervous system) affecting approximately 1 in
2500 individuals (Skre, 1974). CMT is classified according to
its clinical, neurophysiological, inheritance, and genetic pat-
terns (Patzko and Shy, 2012). CMT1 has autosomal dominant
inheritance and slow nerve conduction velocity, suggesting
a myelin dysfunction; CMT2 has autosomal dominant inher-
itance and normal nerve conduction velocity, suggesting an
axonal dysfunction; CMT4 is recessive and demyelinating;
and CMT2-AR is recessive and axonal. Most patients with
CMTX (X-linked CMT) have an intermediate nerve conduction
velocity.
At least 45 causing genes have already been identified and
several others are still coming (Murphy et al., 2012; Patzko
and Shy, 2012). The most frequent mutation worldwide is
duplication of the PMP22 gene, localized on the 17p11.2­
p12 chromosome (Thomas et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2005;
Saporta et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2012), which is responsi-
ble about 60­70% of the CMT1 and 50% of the total CMT
patients. The second most frequently mutated gene is the
GJB1, which is implicated in the CMTX1 group of patients
with an intermediate nerve conduction velocity and who oc-
casionally develop abnormalities in the CNS (central nervous
system) (Murphy et al., 2012; Patzko and Shy, 2012). MFN2

Marie­Tooth disease)
is the most frequently mutated gene in CMT2 (Murphy et al.,
2012; Patzko and Shy, 2012). Interestingly, some of these
patients exhibit intellectual deficits (Genari et al., 2011).
The typical CMT phenotype includes onset of predomi-
nantly motor length-dependent sensory and motor polyneu-
ropathies within the first two decades of life associated with
variable sensory manifestations, decreased or absent tendon
jerks, and skeletal abnormalities, such as pes cavus, hammer
toes, and scoliosis (Thomas et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2005;
Patzko and Shy, 2012) However, marked clinical heterogene-
ity exists, even for the same mutation, in the same family
and for identical twins (Marques et al., 1999). Genetic and
non-genetic factors must therefore be involved.
Some patients develop a severe disease, resulting in
wheelchair or bed restriction and respiratory insufficiency,
but most patients develop a slowly progressive disease com-
patible with a productive life, although their quality of life is
almost always compromised.
CMT: QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHIATRIC
COMORBIDITIES
Previous studies have documented that chronic disease has
a negative impact on quality of life of CMT patients, both in
physical and mental domains (Teunissen et al., 2003; Arnold
et al., 2005; Vinci et al., 2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a,
2008b, 2008c; Redmond et al., 2008; Boenterd et al., 2010;
Calvert et al., 2012).
Similarly, the presence of psychiatric comorbidities is
highlighted in these patients and appear negatively as-
sociated with the welfare and quality of life, supporting
the considerable functional impairments (Rubinsztein et al.,
1998; Gemignani et al., 1999; Dematteis et al., 2001; Pfeiffer
et al., 2001; Teunissen et al., 2003; Arnold et al., 2005; Vinci
et al., 2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a; Kalkman et al., 2007;
Dziewas et al., 2008; Hattan et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009;
Boenterd et al., 2010).
Considering the importance of recognizing psychiatric
symptoms in patients with neurological diseases, especially
with regards to the common etiological factors associated
with these conditions, the present study is aimed to perform
a systematic review of the literature to assess associations
among clinically relevant functional impairments, quality of
life, and psychiatric symptoms in patients with CMT.
METHODS
This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses­
PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) as well as following the in-
structions of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins and Green, 2011).
The terms CMT, HMSN, psychiatric, psychological, psychi-
atry, mental disorder, and quality of life were systematically
searched using the PsycInfo, LILACS, and PUBMED databases.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) language: English or
Portuguese; (b) studies examining the psychiatric indicators

CMT: psychiatric indicators and quality of life
and quality of life in patients with CMT; and (c) studies with-
out date limit filters. The last search was conducted in Jan-
uary, 2014. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies
related to other neurological disorders; (b) epidemiological
studies related to CMT; (c) studies performed in animals; and
(d) genetic, clinical, and/or epidemiological studies related to
CMT. Figure 1 depicts the selection process used to identify
studies.
RESULTS
Using the search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria,
20 studies were selected, and their relevance was assessed by
a psychiatrist and a clinic psychologist.
Study designs
Only one study was qualitative descriptive (Arnold et al.,
2005). Among the quantitative studies, two referred to them-
selves as descriptive (Gemignani et al., 1999; Padua et al.,
2008a), while the remaining studies employed comparisons
among groups (Rubinsztein et al., 1998; Dematteis et al.,
2001; Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Teunissen et al., 2003; Vinci
et al., 2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008b, 2008c; Kalkman et al.,
2007; Dziewas et al., 2008; Redmond et al., 2008; Hattan
et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009; Vinci et al., 2009; Boenterd
et al., 2010; Calvert et al., 2012; Boentert et al., 2014).
Considering the specific aims of the evaluated studies,
it was possible to divide them into two groups, as fol-
lows: (a) studies investigating the comorbidity of psychi-
atric disorders in patients with CMT (Rubinsztein et al., 1998;
Gemignani et al., 1999; Dematteis et al., 2001; Pfeiffer et al.,
2001; Arnold et al., 2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a; Kalk-
man et al., 2007; Dziewas et al., 2008; Hattan et al., 2009;
Phillips et al., 2009; Vinci et al., 2009; Boenterd et al., 2010)
and (b) studies evaluating the impact of the CMT symptoms
on the quality of life (Teunissen et al., 2003; Arnold et al.,
2005; Vinci et al., 2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b,
2008c; Redmond et al., 2008; Boenterd et al., 2010; Calvert
et al., 2012; Boentert et al., 2014), resulting in the current
clinical presentation.
The most of the studies were conducted in Europe, es-
pecially in Italy (N = 7) (Gemignani et al., 1999; Vinci et al.,
2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c; Vinci et al.,
2009), suggesting a lack of studies in the Americas and East-
ern countries. The distinguished cultures can distinctly con-
tribute to the assessment of the quality of life.
Sample characteristics
Ten studies evaluated the different forms of CMT (CMT1,
CMT2, CMTX, and other forms of CMT) (Gemignani et al.,
1999;Arnold et al., 2005; Vinci et al., 2005; Padua et al 2006,
2008a; Redmond et al., 2008; Hattan et al., 2009; Vinci et al.,
2009; Boenterd et al., 2010; Boentert et al., 2014), nine stud-
ies exclusively analyzed patients with CMT1 (Rubinsztein
et al., 1998; Dematteis et al., 2001; Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Teu-
nissen et al., 2003; Padua et al., 2006, 2008b, 2008c; Kalkman
et al., 2007; Dziewas et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2009), and a
single study analyzed only CMT2 (Teunissen et al., 2003).
The diagnoses were performed using a combination of
clinical manifestations, electromyography, and a genetic
exam in 85% of the studies.
Regarding nonclinical groups, utilized comparison groups,
nine studies employed the general population (Dematteis
et al., 2001; Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Teunissen et al., 2003;
Dziewas et al., 2008; Hattan et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009;
Vinci et al., 2009; Boenterd et al., 2010; Calvert et al., 2012)
and five studies used normative data (Vinci et al., 2005; Padua
et al., 2006, 2008b, 2008c; Redmond et al., 2008). However,
seven studies (Rubinsztein et al., 1998; Pfeiffer et al., 2001;
Kalkman et al., 2007; Hattan et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009;
Calvert et al., 2012; Boentert et al., 2014) compared data
with clinical studies examining other neurological disorders,
such as NH (nonhereditary neuropathies), rLTNCs (rare long-
term neurologic conditions), MD (myotonic dystrophy), FSHD
(facioscapulohumeral dystrophy), insomnia, and post-stroke
patients.
Data are detailed in Table 1.
Assessment tools
The instruments applied to evaluate the clinical variables in
the examined studies are schematically presented in Table 2.
Most of the studies used the gold standard instrument
for quality of life evaluation, the SF-36 scale (Vinci et al.,
2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c; Redmond
et al., 2008; Boenterd et al., 2010). This scale is composed of
both the PS (physical score) and the MS (mental score). Briefly,
while low PSs indicate severe physical dysfunctions, distress-
ing body pain, fatigue, and an unfavorable progression, low
MSs indicate frequent emotional suffering and severe social
interaction deficits. Higher scores represent a better quality
of life. The remaining studies employed qualitative interviews
(Arnold et al., 2005) and the RAND-36 (Teunissen et al., 2003)
and EQ-5D (Calvert et al., 2012) scales. Concerning the clin-
ical symptoms of CMT, 11 studies (Rubinsztein et al., 1998;
Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Teunissen et al., 2003; Padua et al., 2006,
2008a, 2008b, 2008c; Kalkman et al., 2007; Phillips et al.,
2009; Vinci et al., 2009; Boenterd et al., 2010) evaluated pa-
tients using scales that rated the intensity of the primary
disease signals and symptoms, such as muscle strength, deam-
bulation, and fatigue. For the evaluation of muscle strength,
there was a trend toward the employment of the United King-
dom Scale (MRC) (Rubinsztein et al., 1998; Padua et al., 2006,
2008a, 2008b; Kalkman et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2009). In
contrast, there was a considerable degree of variation in

on self-rating scales that only estimated signals and symp-
toms, which are not adequate for the diagnosis of mental
disorders. This is an important limitation of these studies.
CMT and quality of life impairment
The primary results related to quality of life in patients with
CMT are presented in the Table 3.
Most studies (N = 8) (Teunissen et al., 2003;Vinci et al.,
2005; Padua et al., 2006, 2008b, 2008c; Redmond et al., 2008;

J. L. C. Cordeiro and others
Boenterd et al., 2010; Calvert et al., 2012) reported impaired
quality of life in patients with CMT compared with healthy
control groups, although CMT does not appear to alter the
life span.
Most studies have reported that decreased quality of life
is associated with muscle strength (Padua et al., 2006, 2008a,
2008b, 2008c), deambulation (Padua et al., 2006, 2008a), and
fatigue (Boenterd et al., 2010). That is, the weakened physical
condition of CMT patients appears to be the primary factor
that contributes to the observed decrease in the quality of
life. Additionally, it was expected that the progression of the
disease would also decrease the quality of life.
However, the results were controversial. Three studies (Te-
unissen et al., 2003; Padua et al., 2006, 2008b) did not find
any decrement in the quality of life related to aging or the
duration of the disease. However, two studies (Vinci et al.,
2005; Redmond et al., 2008) that compared data from CMT
patients with healthy controls using the SF-36 scale revealed
a significant difference associated with age, with quality of
life assessments reaching higher rates in elderly patients with
CMT. This discrepancy could be due to the subjective evalua-
tion of the quality of life, according to Shy and Rose (2005)
which is dynamic and can vary during the disease time course.
Additionally, the slow progression of CMT allows patients
with CMT to find ways to adapt and reduce the impact of the
disease on their quality of life.
Studies that employed the SF-36 scale to evaluate pa-
tients suffering from other chronic diseases, such as dia-
betes mellitus (Tapp et al., 2006), stroke (Mayo et al., 2002),
rheumatoid arthritis, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease), angina, asthma, and epilepsy (Stavem et al., 2000)
have shown a decrement in the quality of life compared with
healthy subjects. This result is in line with the studies exam-
ining CMT patients, suggesting that the observed impairment
in the quality of life is not disease-specific but may be related
to chronic diseases. These studies did not evaluate the associ-
ation between the quality of life indicators and the duration
of the disease.
CMT and depressive disorders
There were no consensus results regarding depression in CMT
patients compared with control groups (see Table 3). Three
studies compared the prevalence of depressive disorders in
patients with CMT to that of healthy controls. Two studies
(Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Vinci et al., 2009) did not report any
significant differences between CMT patients and the con-
trol groups. One study (Phillips et al., 2009) found a greater
diagnostic of depression in patients with CMT. The other two
studies (Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Vinci et al., 2009) did not report
any significant differences between CMT patients and the
control groups. Importantly, each study used distinct instru-
ments to evaluate of the signals and symptoms of depression.
Despite the small number of studies (Rubinsztein et al.,
1998; Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Kalkman et al., 2007; Phillips et al.,
2009), patients with CMT appear to display similar indicators
of depressive disorders as are observed in other neurologi-
cal diseases, such as FSHD (Kalkman et al., 2007) and stroke
(Pfeiffer et al., 2001). When comparing patients with MD and
CMT, the results have been contradictory. While one study
(Kalkman et al., 2007) reported the same rates of depression
in patients affected by these diseases, two studies (Rubin-
sztein et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2009) described a higher
prevalence of depression in patients with MD. In all three of
these studies, patients with MD or CMT presented higher rates
of depressive symptoms than the healthy control groups. The
diversity in the sample sizes of patients with MD and CMT,
as well as in the methodological issues (self-rating scales ­
Rubinsztein et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2009; ­ versus gold
standard instruments ­ Kalkman et al., 2007), should be em-
phasized.
The deficiencies or flaws in the instruments of evaluation
and the lack of standardization across studies that examine
the relationship between depression and CMT can critically
influence these data. The employment of instruments that
track signals and symptoms instead of standard interviews
can mask the true prevalence of depressive disorders. Thus,
these limitations did not allow for the formation of a solid
conclusion.
Previous studies have described the comorbidity between
depression and neurological diseases (van der Werf et al.,
2001;Carson et al., 2003; Surtees et al., 2003; Lobentanz
et al., 2004; Schrag 2004). Following an evaluation of 300
patients with diseases such as Parkinson's, migraine, epilepsy,
and multiple sclerosis, depression was reported in 40% of the
sample (Carson et al., 2003). Moreover, a strong association
between depression and worsened indicators of health, in-
cluding physical, social, and work components, was reported.
Our data regarding the association between depression
and CMT are in line with the literature. Nevertheless, it is not
yet possible to define the role of the depressive symptoms. If
secondary, these symptoms would be related to the disease. If
primary, they would be etiological. These studies suggest that
patients with CMT are a group at increased risk for depressive
symptoms, which can be linked both to the disease and to
the specific conditions that result from this disease, and thus,
CMT patients constitute targets for further research.
CMT and anxiety disorders
As observed in Table 3, the results were discrepant when anx-
iety symptoms were evaluated in patients with CMT and MD
or in healthy controls. In patients with CMT, generalized anx-
iety, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic were
found. However, only a single study (Kalkman et al., 2007)
employed the gold standard interview for DSM-IV, while the
others (Phillips et al., 2009; Vinci et al., 2009) used psychiatric
symptom self-tracking, which may not correspond to psychi-
atric diagnoses. Then the divergence in data may result from
the differences in the sample sizes and/or methodologies

diseases was found.
CMT and sleep disorders
Among sleep disorders, OSAS (obstructive sleep apnoea syn-
drome) (Dematteis et al., 2001; Dziewas et al., 2008; Boen-
tert et al., 2014), RLS (restless legs syndrome) (Gemignani
et al. 1999; Hattan et al., 2009; Boenterd et al., 2010; Boen-
tert et al., 2014), daytime sleepiness (Rubinsztein et al., 1998;
Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2009; Boenterd et al.,
2010), and reduced sleep quality (Rubinsztein et al., 1998;
Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Kalkman et al., 2007; Boenterd et al.,
2010; Boentert et al., 2014) were analyzed. Most studies
(Gemignani et al. 1999; Dematteis et al., 2001; Pfeiffer et al.,
2001; Hattan et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009; Boenterd et al.,
2010) found sleep disturbances in CMT patients compared
with healthy controls, irrespective of the type of disturbance
or the instrument used for evaluation. In two studies (De-
matteis et al., 2001; Dziewas et al., 2008), OSAS frequency
was found to be higher in patients with CMT compared with
healthy controls. Both studies described a positive correlation
between the OSAS severity and neurological impairments in
patients with CMT. A higher prevalence of RLS in patients with
CMT2 compared with patients with CMT1 was reported in
two studies (Gemignani et al. 1999; Hattan et al., 2009), even
though the prevalence of RLS in CMT patients was higher
in all of the studies (Gemignani et al. 1999; Hattan et al.,
2009; Boenterd et al., 2010) compared with control groups.
Of note, one study (Boenterd et al., 2010) has reported, using
multiple analyses of regression, that CMT is a statically sig-
nificant predictor of reduced sleep quality, regardless of age
or gender.
Then, CMT appears to predispose patients to sleep dis-
turbances. In particular, CMT1 patients are predisposed to
OSAS development. From a clinical perspective, it appears
critical to investigate OSAS in patients with CMT1. Although
the association between RLS and peripheral neuropathy is
not fully elucidated, a significant association between CMT
and RLS was observed in the present study, suggesting that
patients with RLS should be investigated for peripheral neu-
ropathy and vice versa, as RLS may be a treatable manifes-
tation of neuropathy (Rutkove et al., 1995). Thus, patients
with CMT can benefit from sleep disorder investigations and
treatments, if applicable.
CONCLUSION
Patients with CMT present a higher risk of developing psy-
chiatric disorders, especially depression. Additionally, these
patients appear to be more susceptible to alterations in
the quality of life, which can be dramatically influenced by
physical limitations. There is a remarkable correlation be-
tween sleep disorders and CMT. These data suggest the im-
portance of the systematic evaluation of these conditions to
reduce the CMT-induced impairments, as well as the quality
of life decrement.
However, our results should be interpreted with caution
because the statistical analysis (meta-analysis) could not be
performed due to the diversity of instruments employed to
assess the distinct outcome variables. Thus, future studies
must demonstrate homogeneous methodologies to statisti-
cally confirm the clinical evidence. The importance of studies
that separate the patients with various CMT subtypes and
those that use structured interviews to accurately estimate
the association between CMT and psychiatric disorders should
also be highlighted.
