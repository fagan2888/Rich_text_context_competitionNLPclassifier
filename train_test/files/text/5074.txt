Abstract: This study tested the prediction derived from the evolutionary
psychological analysis of jealousy that men and women selecting the adaptively
primary infidelity type (i.e., female sexual and male emotional infidelity,
respectively) in a forced-choice response format need to engage in less elaborate
decision strategies than men and women selecting the adaptively secondary infidelity
type (i.e., male sexual and female emotional infidelity, respectively). Unknown to the
participants, decision times were registered as an index of the elaborateness of their
decision strategies. The results clearly support the prediction. Implications and
limitations of the present findings are discussed.

1. Introduction
Recent research on jealousy has been predominantly inspired by an evolutionary
psychological analysis of sex-specific differences in the responses to a mate's sexual
and emotional infidelity (Buss, Larsen, Westen, & Semmelroth, 1992; Daly, Wilson,
& Weghorst, 1982; Symons, 1979). According to this analysis, a woman's sexual
infidelity could reduce a man's reproductive success because of the ensuing risk of
inadvertently losing an opportunity to reproduce and of investing limited paternal
resources for the benefit of genetically unrelated offspring. A woman's reproductive
success, in contrast, is endangered if she loses a male's resources and assistance in
raising her offspring. A man's mere sexual infidelity does not necessarily imply the
risk of losing his paternal investment. Rather, this resource threat arises if he develops
a deep emotional attachment to another mate. As a consequence of these sex-specific
reproductive threats, the male jealousy mechanism (JM) is hypothesized to be
Which Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?
particularly concerned with a mate's sexual infidelity, whereas the female JM is
hypothesized to be particularly concerned with a mate's emotional infidelity.
The assumption of a sex-specific JM inspired an impressive body of research that
has been primarily devoted to testing the hypothesis that the female JM responds with
stronger negative emotions to a mate's emotional infidelity whereas the male JM
generates stronger negative emotions in response to a mate's sexual infidelity (Harris,
2003). This hypothesis received considerable empirical support especially from self-
report measures of emotional distress using a forced-choice response format (e.g.,
Buss et al., 1992; Buss et al., 1999; Buunk, Angleitner, Oubaid & Buss, 1996;
DeSteno & Salovey, 1996; DeSteno, Bartlett, Salovey & Braverman, 2002; Geary,
Rumsey, Bow-Thomas & Hoard, 1995; Harris & Christenfeld, 1996; Pietrzak, Laird,
Stevens & Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle & Millevoi, 2003;
Wiederman & Allgeier, 1993; Wiederman & Kendall, 1999). In each of these studies,
the participants had to indicate which form of a mate's hypothetical infidelity would
arouse more intense negative emotional reactions. Across different cultures, a clear
majority of women consistently chose emotional infidelity as more distressing or
upsetting. In addition, men more often than women chose sexual infidelity as that
type of a mate's infidelity that would distress or upset them more. However, unlike
women's preference, the men's preference for the predicted infidelity event was (a)
mostly less pronounced and less consistent (cf. Harris, 2003), (b) varied between
cultures (e.g., Buunk et al., 1996; Geary et al., 1995), and (c) increased with the
experience of a committed sexual relationship (Buss et al., 1992, Study 3).
The purpose of the present study is to deepen our understanding of the decision
strategies underlying men's and women's choices for one of the two response
alternatives. Based on the evolutionary view of the JM as a content- and sex-specific
information processing device (Schützwohl, 2004; Schützwohl & Koch, 2004), the
prediction was tested that both men and women choosing the adaptively primary
infidelity type (female sexual and male emotional infidelity, respectively) can rely on
their initial spontaneous response tendency rapidly activated by their sex-specific JM.
In contrast, men selecting emotional infidelity and women selecting sexual infidelity
as more distressing need to engage in additional effortful and rational considerations
of the possible trade-offs of the two presented options (DeSteno et al., 2002) the
output of which might subsequently be used to override their initial response
tendencies in a final decision. Thus, the main prediction is that regardless of sex, the
decision processes resulting in the selection of the adaptively secondary infidelity
type (i.e., female emotional and male sexual infidelity) are more elaborate than those
underlying the selection of the adaptively primary infidelity type. These differences
in the elaborateness of the decision processes should be reflected in longer decision
times for the adaptively secondary infidelity type.
To test this prediction, the present study replicates and extends a scenario used by
Buss et al. (1999, Study 2). In this scenario, the participants were asked to imagine
that their partner both formed an emotional attachment to another person and had
sexual intercourse with that other person. Subsequently, they had to indicate which

Which Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?
aspect of the partner's involvement would upset them more. The present procedure
differs from the Buss et al. (1999) study in one important aspect inasmuch as the
scenario was not presented as a paper-and-pencil questionnaire; instead, all
information was presented by means of a computer display. The use of the computer
permitted a recording of the time the participants needed to reach a decision as an
indicator of the elaborateness of the decision processes. As a further change, the
participants were explicitly asked which aspect of their partner's involvement would
make them more jealous instead of the commonly used words upset or distress. One
reason for explicitly asking for jealousy was that upset and distress might connote
two different emotions (e.g., anger and sadness, respectively). Thus, it cannot be
excluded that men and women do not refer to the same emotion when choosing
between the two infidelity types (e.g., men might refer to anger whereas women
might refer to sadness). Another reason was that distress and upset might not
appropriately capture the complexity of the phenomenological experience of jealousy
which could undermine the construct validity of this measure (DeSteno et al., 2002).
2. Method
2.1. Participants
The participants were 100 female and 100 male students of various disciplines at
the University of Bielefeld, Germany. They were recruited in the University hall by
the female experimenter. Their mean age was 25.2 years (SD = 3.8). They were not
paid for their voluntary participation.
2.2 Apparatus
The experiment was controlled by an IBM compatible microcomputer equipped
with an Intel 80486/100 MHz CPU. Instructions, scenarios and response alternatives
were presented on a 15'' computer monitor. ERTS (BeriSoft Corporation) was used
for event scheduling and response measurement.
2.3 Material
All instructions were presented on the computer screen and guided the participants
throughout the experiment. The participants were informed that a series of scenarios
describing various social situations would be presented on the screen and that each
scenario would be followed by a forced-choice between two response alternatives A
and B. More precisely, each scenario briefly described a social situation that was
followed by a question asking for feelings, attitudes or action tendencies that might
occur in the respective situations. The participants were instructed to vividly imagine
the situation and to subsequently press the spacebar in order to view the two pertinent
response alternatives. The participants indicated their decision by pressing one of two

Which Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?
labeled response keys. Before the presentation of the first scenario, the participants
were informed more specifically that the social situations all referred to a committed
romantic relationship that they had had in the past, that they were currently having, or
that they would like to have.
There were four scenarios. The contents of the scenarios 1 - 3 were unrelated to
the present research objectives. Their only function was to accustom the participants
to the experimental procedure. Scenario 4 was a slightly modified version of the
infidelity scenario used by Buss et al. (1999, Study 2):
"Imagine you discover that your partner both formed a deep emotional
and a passionate sexual relationship with another person.
Which aspect of your partner's involvement would make you more
jealous?"
After pressing the space bar, the scenario and the question disappeared and the
following two response alternatives were immediately offered:
(A) the deep emotional relationship.
(B) the passionate sexual relationship.
The sequence of describing the two aspects of the partner's involvement in the
scenario and of their presentation as response alternatives were counterbalanced
across participants.
2.4 Procedure
The participants were tested individually in a dimly lit laboratory room. Upon
arrival, the participants were seated in front of a computer monitor. In order to
enhance the perceived anonymity of the study, the female experimenter informed the
participants that her presence was not necessary because the computer would guide
them throughout the experiment. The participants were not informed about the
measurement of the time expended on the task from the beginning of the presentation
of the scenario until they pressed a labeled response key.
3. Results
3.1 Choice between the two aspects of involvement
Consistent with previous findings with a German sample (Buunk et al., 1996),
both sexes reported more jealousy about the partner's emotional involvement;
however, reliably more men than women (37% vs. 20%) selected their partner's
sexual involvement with another person as making them more jealous, 2(1; N = 200)
= 7.1, p < .01.

3.2 Decision times
The decision times were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with sex and selected infidelity type (emotional vs. sexual infidelity) as the between-
subjects factors. Decision times exceeding the respective group means by more than
three standard deviations were replaced by the respective group mean. This criterion
was met by one male and one female participant both selecting emotional infidelity as
making them more jealous.
The mean decision times for men and women selecting emotional or sexual
infidelity as eliciting more intense jealousy, respectively, are shown in Figure 1. The
two-way ANOVA of the decision times yielded a reliable main effect for sex, F(1,
196) = 14.69, MSE = 582.6, p < .001. Overall, women reached their decision more
rapidly than men (16.4 s vs. 20.8 s). The main effect for selected infidelity type was
negligible, F = 0.

Most importantly, however, the predicted interaction between sex and selected type
of infidelity was highly reliable, F(1, 196) = 12.40, p = .001. In complete agreement
with the predictions derived from the evolutionary analysis of jealousy, women
selecting emotional infidelity reached their decision reliably faster than women
selecting sexual infidelity (15.3 s vs. 20.7 s), t(22; corrected) = 2.65, p = .015. In
contrast, men selecting sexual infidelity reached their decision reliably faster than
men selecting emotional infidelity (18.5 s vs. 22.2 s), t(97; corrected) = 2.13, p =
.035. Thus, the main effect for sex is mainly attributable to the fact that more women
than men chose the "rapid", adaptively primary infidelity type.
4. Discussion
In accordance with the hypothesis derived from the evolutionary view of jealousy,
decisions for the adaptively primary infidelity type were made significantly faster
than decisions for the adaptively secondary infidelity type - irrespective of the
participants' sex. These decision time differences suggest that men selecting sexual
infidelity employed less elaborate decision strategies than men selecting emotional
infidelity. Conversely, women selecting emotional infidelity engaged in less elaborate
processing strategies than women selecting sexual infidelity. These findings support
the assumption that men and women selecting the adaptively primary infidelity type
relied on their initial response tendency suggested by their respective jealousy
mechanism, whereas men and women selecting the adaptively secondary infidelity
type engaged in additional considerations that lead them to override their initial
response tendency (for similar assumptions in overriding presumably evolved anger
reactions resulting from unfair social behavior see Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson,
Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003). Additionally, these findings also contribute to the
emerging evidence of sex-specific differences in the processing of cues to sexual and
emotional infidelity (Schützwohl, 2004; Schützwohl & Koch, 2004). Specifically,
Schützwohl (2004) reported that men and women more efficiently process cues to the
adaptively primary infidelity type; additionally, in the Schützwohl and Koch (2004)
study, men and women were found to preferentially recall cues to the adaptively
primary infidelity type. This preferential recall was significant for both men and
women only when the cues referred to one's own mate infidelity but not when they
referred to an unknown member of the opposite sex.
The present findings also suggest that the forced-choice format does not
necessarily induce a method specific elaborate decision process that is independent of
the participants' sex and final decision as assumed by DeSteno, et al. (2002). These
authors argued that the results traditionally obtained with the forced-choice format
(women preferentially selecting emotional infidelity and men sexual infidelity) is a
method-specific artifact that is attributable to an effortful decision process invoked in
all participants and that enables the participants - particularly women - to override
their (sex-unspecific) initial response tendency towards sexual infidelity and to finally
select emotional infidelity. Moreover, if at all, this reasoning leads to the prediction

Which Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?
that women selecting emotional infidelity engage in a more elaborate decision
process than women selecting sexual infidelity (who could rely on their initial
response tendency towards sexual infidelity). Obviously, this prediction is clearly
refuted by the present findings.
Some shortcomings of the present study which point in the direction of future
research need to be addressed. First, it is conceivable, that men and women after
engaging in elaborate processing strategies may still select the adaptively primary
infidelity type. Note that this possibility hampers the verification of the hypothesis.
The present findings, however, suggest that this might have occurred rarely ­ if at all.
Nevertheless, it would be desirable to identify additional evidence for the processing
strategies involved in the solution of the forced-choice dilemma. Second, although the
present study reveals first insights in men and women's processing strategies when
confronted with a forced-choice between sexual and emotional infidelity as the
infidelity type eliciting stronger feelings of jealousy, it does not specify the exact
nature of the decision processes involved, particularly those that cause especially men
and to a considerably lesser extent women to select the adaptively secondary
infidelity type. Thus, an important task of subsequent studies would be to detail the
relevant cognitive processes underlying the selection of the adaptively primary and
secondary infidelity type.
