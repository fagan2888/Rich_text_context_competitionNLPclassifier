OBJECTIVE--To examine whether there were long-term (between 1988­1994 and 2001­
2008) and recent (between 2001­2004 and 2005­2008) changes in blood pressure (BP) levels
among U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Using data from National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined changes in BP distributions, mean BPs, and
proportion with BP ,140/90 mmHg.
RESULTS--Between 1988­1994 and 2001­2008, for adults with diabetes, mean BPs
decreased from 135/72 mmHg to 131/69 mmHg (P , 0.01) and the proportion with BP
,140/90 mmHg increased from 64 to 69% (P = 0.01). Although hypertension prevalence in-
creased, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control improved. However, there was no
evidence of improvement for adults 20­44 years old. Between 2001­2004 and 2005­2008,
there were no significant changes in BP levels.
CONCLUSIONS--BP levels among adults with diabetes improved between 1988­1994 and
2001­2008, but the progress stalled between 2001­2004 and 2005­2008. The lack of improve-
ment among young adults is concerning.

Hypertension is particularly deleteri-
ous for people with diabetes be-
cause it confers 2 ;3 times the risk
for cardiovascular morbidity and mortal-
ity as for people without diabetes (1,2).
Studies demonstrated that blood pressure
(BP) control is crucial to reduce vascular
complications and improve survival for
people with diabetes (3,4). The propor-
tion of people with diabetes with poorly
controlled BP declined considerably be-
tween the 1970s and the 1990s (5). How-
ever, in recent studies using the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES) data, no improvements
in BP levels among adults with diabetes
were observed from 1988­1994 to early
2000s (6) or from 1999 to 2006 (7). We
updated prior studies with the most re-
cent NHANES 2007­2008 data to exam-
ine long-term (between 1988­1994 and
2001­2008) and recent (between 2001­
2004 and 2005­2008) changes in BP
levels among U.S. adults with diagnosed
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS--We analyzed data from
the NHANES 1988­1994 and 2001­
2008. Our study included adults aged
20 years or older with self-reported diag-
nosed diabetes (regardless of hyperten-
sion status). We used an average of up
to three BP readings to determine an
individual's BP level. After excluding peo-
ple with missing BP values (n = 192),
3,255 people were included in final anal-
ysis.
Our outcome measures included BP
distributions, mean systolic BP (SBP) and
diastolic BP (DBP), and the proportion
with SBP ,140 and DBP ,90 mmHg. To
define categories for BP distributions, we
adopted a method applied by Cheng et al.
(8). Using combined NHANES 1988­
1994 and 2001­2008 data, we first iden-
tified the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the
BP distribution of the study population;
next, we equally divided the BP values
between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles
into nine intervals; we then conducted
multiple categorical logistic regression to
obtain the predicted percentage in each
BP category for each study period adjust-
ing for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Hypertension was defined as SBP
$140 mmHg or DBP $90 mmHg, or
self-reporting of taking antihypertensive
medications. Among those with hyperten-
sion, participants were considered aware of
hypertension status if they answered
that they had been told that they had hy-
pertension; those who reported taking
antihypertensive medications were con-
sidered under treatment, and those with
SBP ,140 mmHg and DBP ,90 mmHg
were considered to have BP in control.
Data analyses were performed using
SAS 9.1.3 and SUDAAN 9.0. Mean BPs,
the proportion with BP ,140/90 mmHg,
and hypertension prevalence, awareness,
treatment,andcontrolratewereage-adjusted
to the NHANES 2005­2008 diabetic popu-
lation. We used t tests to assess differences
in means and rates between time periods.
A P value , 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS--Figure 1 depicts shifts in
both SBP and DBP distributions toward
lower levels between 1988­1994 and
2001­2008. However, only a small per-
centage in either period had DBP $90
mmHg.
Between 1988­1994 and 2001­2008,
overall mean BPs decreased from 135/72
mmHg to 131/69 mmHg (P value , 0.01).

Mean BPs decreased in all subgroups
except for adults aged 20­44 years (Sup-
plementary Table 1). The overall age-
adjusted proportion with BP ,140/90
mmHg increased from 63.8 to 69.2%
(P = 0.01). The increase was significant
for adults aged 45­64 years, women, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans,
but not for other subgroups.
Between 1988­1994 and 2001­2008,
age-adjusted hypertension prevalence in-
creased from 56.0 to 67.3% (P , 0.01)
overall, but did not increase significantly
among women, Mexican Americans, and
adults aged 20­44 years (Supplementary
Table 2). Overall, improvements were
seen in age-adjusted hypertension aware-
ness (84.1 to 92.3%), treatment (75.0 to
88.4%), and control (38.1 to 54.0%) (all
P , 0.01). Adults aged 20­44 years expe-
rienced no significant increase in any of
these measures, and Mexican Americans
had no significant improvement in aware-
ness of hypertension.
Between 2001­2004 and 2005­
2008, there was no significant change
for overall mean BP (SBP, 131.7 vs.
131.3 mmHg, P = 0.7; DBP, 68.3 vs.
68.9 mmHg, P = 0.6) and for the age-
adjusted proportion with BP ,140/90
mmHg (69.7 vs. 68.7%, P = 0.7) (Supple-
mentary Table 3). Furthermore, no signifi-
cant changes were found for any subgroups
analyzed. There were also no significant
changes in hypertension prevalence, aware-
ness, treatment, and control for all groups
except for hypertension prevalence in-
creasing for young adults (P = 0.02) (Sup-
plementary Table 4).
CONCLUSIONS--BP levels among
U.S. adults with diabetes improved be-
tween 1988­1994 and 2001­2008. There
was no evidence of any improvement
among adults aged 20­44 years. Virtually
all of the improvements were limited to the
1990s, and no significant improvements
were seen in the 2000s.
The improvement in BP levels, in con-
junction with prior reported improvement
inA1C levels(9),may indicate encouraging
trends in diabetes management. Indeed,
despite upward hypertension prevalence,
which may be driven in part by rising obe-
sity (10), BP levels improved, indicating
probably more effective hypertension
management. During our study period,
landmark clinical trials showed that BP
control reduced vascular complications
(3,4) and new clinical guidelines lowered
BP targets to ,130/80 mmHg (11,12).
Awareness of the benefits of BP control
may have increased and treatment inten-
sified. Furthermore, the lowered BP target
might have resulted in earlier diagnosis
and treatment at lower BP levels, contrib-
uting not only to the observed increase
in hypertension prevalence but also to
increased awareness, treatment, and con-
trol rates.
The lack of improvement among
young adults is concerning because of
their future risk of developing vascular
complications at younger ages. Several
factors could explain the poor levels of
control in younger patients, including a
lower adherence to medications (13); a
lower tendency to receive treatment in-
tensification (14); and less optimal care
for hypertension, i.e., delayed initiation
of pharmacotherapy when lifestyle inter-
vention fails (15).
Limitations of our study include the
relative small samplesizes for young adults,
which may limit our ability to detect small
changes. BP measurement errors may
also exist since BP was measured at a sin-
gle occasion in the NHANES. However,
the methods were consistent across all
NHANES and BP levels were based on
averaged readings.
Finally, we found that the progress in
BP levels in the adult population with
diabetes may have stalled in 2000s. Al-
though hypertension awareness and
treatment rates are now high (;90%), hy-
pertension prevalence remains high and
control rates are suboptimal, indicating
need for effective prevention and control
strategies.
