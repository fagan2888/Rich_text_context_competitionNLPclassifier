Submitted on August 23, 2010; resubmitted on April 5, 2011; accepted on April 14, 2011
background: We examine variation in fertility-specific distress (FSD) and general distress according to different experiences of infer-
tility among 1027 US women who have experienced infertility within the previous 10 years.
methods: General distress was measured by a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression. Multiple regression
analysis was conducted on self-report data (based on a telephone interview) from a probability-based sample of US women aged 25­45
years. We compare women with infertility who have had a prior pregnancy (secondary infertility, n ¼ 628) to women with infertility with
no prior pregnancies (primary infertility, n ¼ 399). We further distinguish between women with infertility who were actually `trying' to
become pregnant (the infertile with intent) with those who met the medical definition of infertile but did not describe themselves as
trying to become pregnant (infertile without intent).
results: Both types of infertility (primary versus secondary) (b ¼ 0.31*) and intentionality (infertile with and without intent) (b ¼ 0.08*)
are associated with FSD. These associations persist when we control for resource and demographic variables, life course variables, social
support and social pressure variables. General distress does not vary by infertility type or intentionality.
conclusions: Results reveal variation in women's recalled experiences of infertility and that FSD is more sensitive to effects of different
experiences than general distress. Women with primary infertility who were explicitly trying to become pregnant at the time of the infertility
episode stand out as a particularly distressed group. Caregivers should be aware that the emotional needs of women with primary infertility
may differ from those with secondary infertility.
Key words: fertility-specific distress / infertility / pregnancy intentionality / population-based study / women
Introduction
Although there are many studies of psychological distress among
women with infertility (for reviews see Henning and Strauss, 2002;
Greil et al., 2010), only a handful of studies have examined the
relationship between infertility and psychological distress among
women who have not sought medical help for infertility. Furthermore,
many studies have treated women with infertility as a monolithic
group, thus missing important distinctions among women with differ-
ent types of infertility (primary or secondary) or degree of `intention-
ality' at the time of the infertility episode (trying, or open to
conception). We examine variations in fertility-specific distress (FSD)
and general distress (CESD) by type of infertility in a nation-wide
probability sample of 4796 US women, of which 1027 have reported
at least one episode of infertility within the past 10 years. We compare
women with infertility who have had a prior pregnancy (secondary
infertility) to women with infertility with no prior pregnancies
(primary infertility). In addition, we compare women who were actu-
ally `trying' to become pregnant at the time of their infertility episode
(the infertile with intent) with those who met the medical definition of
infertility but were not explicitly trying to become pregnant (the infer-
tile without intent). Because characteristics such as race, income,
access to private health insurance, importance of motherhood and
treatment-seeking differ by type of infertility, we explore whether con-
trolling for various characteristics explains the associations between
type of infertility, intentionality and distress. In addition, we assess

whether or not measures of FSD or measures of general distress are
more sensitive to variations in the experience of infertility.
Infertility and psychological distress
According to commonly accepted medical criteria for infertility, women
are categorized as infertile if they experience a year or more of unpro-
tected intercourse without conception (Zegers-Hochschild et al.,
2009). Using this definition, the National Survey of Family Growth esti-
mates that 7.4% of married US women were currently infertile in 2002
(Chandra and Stephen, 2006). Tests of the hypothesis that infertility is a
source of psychological distress have typically used standardized
measures normed on the general population to see if the infertile
score is different than the population at large or if they have higher
scores than women in a non-infertile comparison group. Most studies
employing standardized measures of general psychological distress
have found that women with infertility score as more distressed than
persons with no reported fertility problems on at least some subscales,
but less distressed than those with clinical mental illnesses (Greil, 1997;
Fekkes et al., 2003; Monga et al., 2004).
Drawing conclusions from research on infertility and distress is
made more difficult by several methodological limitations in prior
studies. First, women with infertility who serve as subjects for much
research on infertility and psychological distress do not always rep-
resent the full range of women who meet the criteria for infertility.
Until recently, most studies on the psychosocial consequences of
infertility were limited to clinic-based samples of women-seeking treat-
ment. In the USA, it is estimated that only half of couples with inferti-
lity seek treatment (Chandra and Stephen, 2010). Therefore studies
based on clinic samples capture the experiences of only one-half of
women with infertility. Because non-treatment seekers differ substan-
tially from treatment seekers on race, socioeconomic status and other
characteristics, this is a potentially serious omission (Greil et al., 2010).
In addition, the use of clinic samples confounds the consequences of
treatment seeking, treatment itself and fertility status. Evidence
suggests that the common characterization of infertile woman as
totally immersed in the process of trying to become pregnant
describes only treatment seekers, and does not reflect the broader
experience of non-treatment seekers (Greil and McQuillan, 2004).
Fertility-specific distress
A second reason for concern about findings regarding the psychologi-
cal sequelae of infertility is the types of measures used to capture
psychological distress. Conventional general measures of distress are
unlikely to be sufficiently sensitive or specific to the problems of infer-
tility to adequately reflect the experience of many women (Jacob et al.,
2007; Schmidt, 2009). Specific measures of infertility distress tend to
have strong correlations with standardized measures of distress, indi-
cating the face validity of fertility-specific measures (Ulbrich et al.,
1990; Abbey et al., 1992). Fertility-specific measures, however, do
not permit comparison with control groups or population norms.
Thus, these measures are most useful for comparisons among
women and couples with infertility.
A third reason for concerns about findings in studies of the psycho-
logical consequences of infertility among women is the heterogeneity
among women with infertility. For example, Wischmann et al. (2001)
found that most women and couples with infertility do not have
psychopathology, but there are some who need psychological help.
Much of the research on variation in distress among women with
infertility has focused on differences in coping strategies and other
psychological attributes (Benyamini et al., 2005; Miles et al., 2009;
Peterson et al., 2009; Sexton et al., 2010; Van den Broeck et al.,
2010). Much less research has looked at differences by type of inferti-
lity or demographic, situational and attitudinal correlates of infertility
distress.
Variables influencing distress among women
with infertility
Among women with infertility, several characteristics are associated
with differing levels of distress. FSD measures are particularly
well-suited for assessing variation among women with infertility,
although few measures of FSD have been utilized for this purpose.
Greil and McQuillan (2004) have divided women with infertility into
the `infertile with intent' (women who say they tried to conceive for
at least 12 months without conception) and the `infertile without
intent' (women who report having had unprotected intercourse
without conception but who do not say that they were explicitly
trying to conceive at the time) and have found these two groups to
be different in striking ways. It is important to point out that this
`intent' measure is not a measure of the general desire for a child
but rather a measure of planfulness. Many women in the USA say
that they are neither planning to become pregnant or planning not
to become pregnant but rather are `okay either way' (McQuillan
et al., 2010). Many of these women may welcome a pregnancy
when it occurs and many may become concerned about their fertility
should they fail to become pregnant over time. Intentionality with
regard either to a particular pregnancy or pregnancy in general and
wanting a(nother) child are two conceptually separate variables, and
the nature of their relationship to one another is an empirical question.
Although infertile women without intent are less likely to pursue treat-
ment (Greil et al., 2009), some of them do seek treatment. Women
who are infertile with intent do not differ from the infertile without
intent with regard to general distress, but they do score significantly
higher on FSD (Greil and McQuillan, 2010).
Many people associate infertility with involuntary childlessness, but
evidence suggests that the incidence of secondary infertility--`infertility
in a patient who has previously conceived' (Anderson, 2003, p. 923)--
is actually somewhat higher than the incidence of primary infertility
(Chandra and Stephen, 2010). Older studies utilizing standardized
measures of anxiety and stress have not found differences between
levels of distress among women with primary as opposed to second-
ary infertility (Downey and McKinney, 1992; Edelmann et al., 1994),
but newer studies have found that women with primary infertility
exhibit higher levels of distress than women with secondary infertility
(Epstein and Rosenberg, 2005; Upkong, 2006; Verhaak et al., 2007).
Older studies show that distress specific to infertility is higher
among women with primary rather than secondary infertility
(Freeman et al., 1983; Callan and Hennessey, 1988). In order to
account for the many characteristics that may be associated with
general and FSD among women with infertility, we control for a
number of characteristics in addition to the focal associations
between type of infertility (primary or secondary) and intentionality
with regard to getting pregnant.

Statement of the problem
We focus on two intersecting characteristics of infertility episodes to
better understand the variance in distress levels among women
meeting the medical criteria for infertility, controlling for potentially
confounding characteristics. The National Survey of Fertility Barriers
(NSFB) provides a way to assess several correlates of FSD and
general distress among a random sample of US women of reproduc-
tive age. We therefore use these data to evaluate the following
hypotheses about distress among women meeting the medical criteria
for infertility:
(i) Intentionality should be associated with FSD. The infertile with
intent should have higher levels of FSD than the infertile
without intent even after other variables--including wanting a
child--are controlled. This relationship should persist when the
sample is restricted only to women who have received
treatment.
(ii) Type of infertility should be associated with FSD. Women who
have not had a pregnancy (i.e. the primary infertile) should
exhibit higher FSD scores than women who have been pregnant
(i.e. the secondary infertile) even after other variables are con-
trolled. This relationship should persist when the sample is
restricted only to women who have received treatment.
(iii) General distress should be less sensitive to variations in the
experience of infertility. General distress should be unrelated to
either intentionality or type of infertility.
(iv) Age should be associated with FSD. Older women should be
more distressed than younger women.
(v) Such fertility-related variables as family support and pressure,
importance of motherhood, and wanting more children should
be associated with FSD.
(vi) General distress should be less sensitive to fertility-related vari-
ables and more related to demographic variables that are associ-
ated with general distress in general samples.
Materials and Methods
Setting
This study was conducted in the USA, an economically and racially diverse
country where costs for infertility are particularly high, where there is no
universal health care, and where most states do not mandate that the
costs of infertility treatment be covered by insurance (Chambers et al.,
2009; Connolly et al., 2010).
Subjects
The NSFB conducted telephone interviews with 4796 women aged 25­45
years in the USA. Some of their partners were also included but are not
part of this analysis. This Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sample consists of a
nationally representative sample, plus an over-sample of Census central
office codes with a high-minority population to ensure sufficient numbers of
women for subgroup analyses. Our sample design included a prenotification
letter with a $1 or $2 cash incentive for all telephone numbers with address
matches. The incentive was changed from $2 to $1 following an experimental
comparison built into a random sample segment that found little difference in
response rate between the two amounts. Interviewing was conducted by the
Survey ResearchCenterat the Pennsylvania StateUniversityandthe Bureau of
Sociological Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The same
interviewer training material and interviewer guides were used at both sites.
Methodological information, including the methodology report, introductory
letters, interview schedules, interviewer guides, data imputation procedures
and a detailed description of the planned missing design can be accessed at:
http://sodapop.pop.psu.edu/codebooks/nsfb/wave1/. The public-access
data files can be accessed at: http://sodapop.pop.psu.edu/
data-collections/nsfb. Screening questions were used to create additional
oversamples of women who had had an infertility episode, who had never
given birth, who had miscarried in the past, and/or who would like to have
a baby in the future, and the study only selected 10% of women who reported
having completed child bearing (the comparison group). We weight the data
toaccountforthedisproportionateprobabilitythatwomeninminoritygroups
and/or women with past or potential fertility barriers were included in the
sample. Interviews were designed to take 35 min and included detailed
reproductive histories, demographic measures and attitudinal measures. A
`planned missing' design was used to provide a way to incorporate more indi-
cators of key concepts while minimizing respondent burden and keeping the
interview relatively short. The estimated response rate for the sample is
53.0% for the screener,which istypicalfor RDD telephonesurveys conducted
in recent years (McCarty et al., 2006). Extensive comparisons with Census
data indicate our weighted sample is representative of women aged 25­45
years in the USA.
The sample for the present analysis consists of 1027 women who
reported an episode of infertility in the 10 years prior to the interview.
An `episode' of infertility is, for the purposes of this analysis, any period
of 12 months or greater during which a women had regular intercourse
and was either trying to conceive or `okay either way' about conception
but did not conceive. Women were considered to have had an episode
of infertility if they answered yes to either of the following questions: (i)
`Was there ever a time when you were trying to get pregnant but did
not conceive within 12 months?' or (ii) `Was there ever a time when
you regularly had sex without using birth control for a year or more
without getting pregnant?' Only women who were not breastfeeding
were included. Of the women who reported an episode of infertility,
59.4% had a subsequent live birth. In analyses not shown here, we
determined that eliminating women who had a live birth after infertility
did not change the pattern of results, so we include them in the analysis
presented here.
Measures
Fertility-specific distress
One dependent variable in this study is FSD. A number of fertility-specific
measures have been developed (See especially Keye et al., 1984; Abbey
et al., 1991; Hjelmstedt et al., 1999; Newton et al., 1999; Schmidt,
2006; Jacob et al., 2007), but none of these measures has achieved the
status of a standard measure. The measures of Newton et al. (1999)
and Schmidt (2006) have been used in several studies (see e.g. Benyamini
et al., 2005; Panagopoulou et al., 2006; Lykeridou et al., 2009; Mahajan
et al., 2009; Wilkins et al., 2010) although they are too long for many
situations. A new measure, the Fertility Quality of Life Questionnaire (Fer-
tiQoL), has recently been developed by Boivin et al. (2010) and tested for
validity and reliability (Verhaak et al., 2010). This measure may well
become a generally accepted measure of fertility distress, but it has not
yet been used in many studies and was not available when we conducted
our research. In addition, it was important for the purposes of the larger
study to phrase questions in language general enough to apply to other fer-
tility barriers in addition to infertility (such as pregnancy loss and situational
fertility barriers). Finally, it was necessary to construct a short measure in
order to ease respondent burden and allow time to ask all of the other
questions included in the survey. Thus, rather than use the longer scales
that have already been developed [e.g. 46-item scale proposed by
Variation in distress among women with infertility 2103
Newton et al. (1999)], the NSFB team created a 6-item scale comprised of
questions that draw on the Hjelmstedt et al.'s (1999) Infertility Reaction
Scale, qualitative research on infertile couples (e.g. Greil, 1991) and the
clinical experience of members of the research team.
Respondents who reported having tried unsuccessfully to become preg-
nant for a period of at least 12 months were read the statement: `You
tried for quite a while to get pregnant. Please tell me whether you had
these reactions when you didn't get pregnant'. Women who had a
period of at least 12 months of regular intercourse but who did not say
that they were trying to become pregnant were read the statement:
`You had several months of sex without using birth control without
getting pregnant. Please tell me whether you had these reactions when
you didn't get pregnant'. Both groups of women were then presented
with a series of items and asked whether they felt this way frequently,
occasionally, seldom or never. The items were: I felt cheated by life; I
felt that I was being punished; I felt angry at God; I felt inadequate; I felt
seriously depressed about it; I felt like a failure as a woman. The scale
was computed using the mean of available items, such that it ranges
from 0 to 1. Because of the planned missing design, each respondent
received two thirds of the items chosen at random. Almost all (96.7%)
responded to all items with which they were presented. Two of the
items, `I felt I was being punished' and `I felt angry at God', have religious
overtones; to ascertain whether religiosity may have influenced FSD scores
we conducted independent samples t-tests on these items and found that
neither item was significantly associated with religiosity. In addition, the
correlation between the FSD scale and religiosity is 0.025 and is not signifi-
cant. Higher scores indicate greater distress. This scale has an a of 0.830
for the sample used in this analysis.
General distress (CESD-10)
The other dependent variable used in this study is general distress.
General distress is measured by the CESD-10 (Andresen et al., 1994), a
shorter version of the well known 20-item Center for Epidemiological
Studies Distress Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977). The CES-D is not a diag-
nostic instrument but was specifically developed for use in community
surveys. It is easy to administer, has been translated into Spanish, has
excellent measurement properties (a ¼ 0.860 for this sample), and is
appropriate for a study in which explanation, and not treatment, is the
central focus (Hann et al., 1999). The CES-D does not distinguish well
between depressive and anxious conditions and may over-identify
`cases' (Orme et al., 1986; Rabkin and Klein, 1987; Zich, et al., 1990).
The CESD-10 has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity
and to be equivalent to the longer version in predictive accuracy
(Cheung et al., 2007; Lee and Chokkanathan, 2008; Bradley et al., 2010).
Infertility type
The two focal independent variables are infertility type and intentionality
with regard to pregnancy. Infertile respondents were classified as belong-
ing to one of two groups based on whether or not they had experienced
prior pregnancies. The primary infertility group includes 399 (38.9%)
respondents who experienced a period of infertility before they had
experienced any pregnancies. The secondary infertility group consists of
628 (61.1%) respondents who were pregnant at least once prior to an
infertility episode. The medical definition of primary infertility is infertility
with no prior pregnancies, but some researchers (e.g. Epstein and Rosen-
berg, 2005; Chandra and Stephen, 2010) define `primary infertility' as
infertility in a woman who has not had previous children, even though
she may have had a prior pregnancy. In a preliminary analysis, we
divided women with infertility into three categories: women with no
prior pregnancies; women with at least one prior pregnancy but no live
births; and women who experienced an infertility episode but have had
live births prior to experiencing an infertility episode. This preliminary
analysis revealed that the 45 women with pregnancies but no live births
were significantly different on FSD from women with no prior pregnancies
but did not differ significantly from women with live births. In order to
keep the analysis as simple and clear as possible, we combined the
`prior pregnancy but no live birth group' with the `live birth' group.
Thus, our working definitions of primary and secondary infertility match
the medical definitions of these terms. We regard women who have
had no prior pregnancies as having primary infertility and women with at
least one prior pregnancy as having secondary infertility.
Intentionality
Of the women who reported having an episode of unprotected regular
intercourse of over 12 months, 57.7% described themselves as trying to
become pregnant at the time of their infertility episode and were classified
as infertile with intent. The remaining 42.3% did not report trying to
become pregnant but said they were `okay either way' during their infer-
tility episode and were classified as infertile without intently.
Resource and demographic variables
We controlled for variables which previous research suggested should be
related to distress. These variables are summarized in Table I.
Method of analysis
We conducted two ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses for
FSD. OLS regression is the appropriate technique where the dependent
variable is quantitative and continuous. In the first analysis we regressed
FSD on all variables for the entire sample of women with infertility. In
the second analysis, we limited the sample to women who received
tests or treatment for infertility in order to test whether similar results
would be obtained when the sample was limited to treatment seekers
only. Who to include as having received tests or treatment for infertility
was determined by looking at a series of questions about tests and treat-
ment as well as by examining detailed pregnancy histories. Anyone who
reported receiving specific tests or treatment for infertility was included
in the `tests and treatment-only' sample as well as in the full sample.
Women are included in the treatment sample if they have received any
tests or treatment for infertility. Only a small minority of the women in
the treatment sample (17.6%) have received assisted reproduction treat-
ments. We repeated the same two analyses using CES-D as the depen-
dent variable. In analyses not shown here, we added an interaction term
for infertility type by intentionality with regard to pregnancy. Because
the interaction was not significant in any of the analyses, we do not
report interaction effects in this article.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Table II presents descriptive statistics for the independent variables
across the various infertility groups, showing differences among
women with every possible combination of infertility type and intention-
ality. Table II provides several insights regarding intentionality and infer-
tility type among women who meet the criteria for infertility. The most
common image of women with infertility is that of a woman who sees
herself as having explicitly tried to get pregnant and has never had a
child. Yet, this group makes up only 34.5% of all of the women who
meet the medical criteriafor infertility. Women with secondary infertility
make up 61.1% of women with infertility and are about equally divided
between the infertile without intent (i.e. not explicitly trying to become
2104 Greil et al.
pregnant at the time of the infertility episode) (31.5%) and the infertile
with intent (29.6%). The remaining group (infertile without intent,
primary infertility) makes up only a small percentage of the women
who meet the criteria for infertility (4.4%).
FSD varies by infertility group, but CESD-10 does not. FSD is highest
among the women who have the situation most commonly thought of as
`infertile': women with no pregnancies who were explicitly trying to con-
ceive at the time of the infertility episode (Mean FSD ¼ 0.43). This is sig-
nificantly higher than the mean for the infertile with intent women who
have had a pregnancy (Mean FSD ¼ 0.37). Both of these means are sig-
nificantly higher than the means for the infertile without intent (M ¼
0.18 for infertile without intent, no prior pregnancy; M ¼ 0.15 for infer-
tile without intent, secondary infertility).
These patterns suggest that both infertility type and intentionality
are associated with FSD. Yet it is also possible that characteristics of
the women in each of these groups could differ, and those differences,
not infertility type/intentionality could explain the differences in FSD.
We therefore examined the characteristics associated with infertility
type/intentionality. Only a few characteristics are consistent across
groups: religiosity, internal medical locus of control, ethical concerns
about infertility treatment, percentage Hispanic, percentage Asian
percent in states with mandated insurance coverage, percentage
with their first infertility episode 0­5 years ago and percentage with
their first infertility episode 6­10 years ago. As is evident in
Table II, there are many differences in characteristics by infertility
type/intentionality group, but no simple overall pattern emerged.

Fertility-specific distress
We now turn to the results of the multiple regression analyses. The
first set of coefficients in Table III displays the results of the OLS
multiple regression of the relationship between intentionality, infertility
type, control variables and FSD for the entire sample of women who
have had an episode of infertility within the past 10 years. For the
entire sample, women who were explicitly trying to become pregnant
during the infertility episode have higher FSD scores (b ¼ 0.31) than
the infertile without intent, even when other variables--including
current desire for another child--are controlled. The same

relationship is also found when the sample is limited to women who
have received tests or treatment (b ¼ 0.19). For both the entire
sample (b ¼ 0.08) and for women who have received tests or treat-
ment only (b ¼ 0.14), women with primary infertility have higher FSD
scores than women with secondary infertility.
Ofthe resource and demographic variables, onlyage is relatedto FSD.
As anticipated, for both the entire sample and the sample of those who
have received tests or treatment, age is positively associated with FSD
(b ¼ 0.07 and b ¼ 0.12, respectively), indicating that older women
have higher FSD scores than younger women. Higher levels of social
support are associated with lower FSD in both the full sample and
those who received tests or treatment (b ¼ 20.15 and b ¼ 20.08,
respectively). Of the social support and social pressure variables, only
family encouragement to seek treatment is associated with FSD. For
the entire sample only, women with families (b ¼ 0.08) who encourage
medical help seeking for infertility have higher average FSD scores than
women who do not have encouragement. Higher importance of
motherhood is associated with higher FSD for both the full sample
and those who received tests or treatment (b ¼ 0.15 and b ¼ 0.21,
respectively), as is a desire to have more children (b ¼ 0.11 and b ¼
0.17, respectively) but these associations do not explain away the differ-
ences in FSD scores among women with different types of infertility and
levels of intentionality. All the independent variables taken collectively
account for over a quarter of the variance in FSD (R2 ¼ 0.277), and
among the treatment only sample, almost half of the variance was
accounted for by these variables (R2 ¼ 0.465).

Variation in distress among women with infertility 2107
General distress
Table IV presents the same analyses as Table III but now the depen-
dent variable is CESD-10. For neither the full sample nor the sample of
those who have received tests or treatment is there a significant
association between either intentionality or type of infertility and
CESD-10. Several of the control variables are significantly associated
with CESD-10. Women who are employed have lower levels of dis-
tress in both the full sample and those who received tests or treat-
ment (b ¼ 20.07 and b ¼ 20.12, respectively). Higher levels of
education are associated with lower levels of CESD-10 for both the
full sample and for women who have received tests or treatment
(b ¼ 20.16 and b ¼ 20.20, respectively). For both the full sample
and for women who have received tests or treatment, women with
private health insurance have lower CESD-10 scores (b ¼ 20.12
and b ¼ 20.16, respectively) than women without private health
insurance. Among the full sample only, CESD-10 is lower among
women who report higher levels of social support (b ¼ 20.11) and
among women who report higher levels of religiosity (b ¼ 20.08).
All the independent variables taken collectively account for just over
one-third of the variance in CESD-10 (R2 ¼ 0.366) in the full sample
and almost half of the variance among women who have received
tests and treatment (R2 ¼ 0.429).
To summarize, infertility type and intentionality with regard to preg-
nancy are both associated with FSD, but neither is associated with
CESD-10. Other infertility-related variables, such as encouragement

Discussion
This study is one of very few studies of infertility and psychological dis-
tress that focuses on women with infertility who are not in treatment
as well as those who are. Looking at those who are not in treatment
allows us to (i) judge the generalizability of findings from clinic samples,
(ii) begin to sort out the psychological effects of infertility from the
psychological effects of infertility treatment and (iii) assess the
unmet need for counseling services. In this article, we took advantage
of a US population-based sample and compared results from a general
sample to a sample restricted to those in treatment.
We hypothesized (Hypothesis i) that intentionality about pregnancy
would be associated with FSD. Specifically, we hypothesized that
women who described themselves as trying to become pregnant at
the time of their infertility episode would have higher levels of FSD
than women who did not describe themselves as explicitly trying to
become pregnant at the time of the infertility episode. This hypothesis
was supported. Our findings confirm other research we have done on
intentionality with regard to becoming pregnant (Greil and McQuillan,
2004; Greil et al., 2010). It is important to note that of the infertile
without intent say they want more children even though they do
not describe themselves as trying to become pregnant at the time
of the infertility episode. Thus, it is important not to confuse intention-
ality with regard to desire to become pregnant at a particular time
with wanting to have another child in general. Furthermore, even
when we limit the sample to only those who have received tests or
treatment, the effect of intentionality remains. These results suggest
that determining intentionality at the time of an infertility episode
should be useful for counseling women with infertility. Further,
health care providers must also be aware that even though their
patients may report that they are not currently trying to get pregnant,
they may, in fact, meet criteria for infertility and want to have children.
Some women simply do not identify with the idea of `trying' to con-
ceive (Greil and McQuillan, 2010). As most of these women desire
(more) children, informing women about treatment options could
be beneficial for future treatment success.
We also hypothesized (Hypothesis ii) that women with primary
infertility would have higher levels of FSD than women with secondary
infertility. This hypothesis was also supported, confirming the findings
of the few other--now dated--studies that have looked at the
relationship between FSD and type of infertility (Freeman et al.,
1983; Callan and Hennessey, 1988). Infertility caregivers need to be
aware that the emotional needs of women with primary infertility
may differ from those of women with secondary infertility.
It is also clear that FSD proved to be much more sensitive to vari-
ations in distress among women with infertility than CESD-10
(Hypothesis iii). We did not find significant relationships between
either infertility type or intentionality with CESD-10, a measure of
general distress. In fact, we found very few relationships with
general distress other than resource and demographic variables. At
first glance, the lack of findings with regard to a measure of general
distress may appear to contradict numerous reports that infertility is
associated with general distress (Greil, 1997; Fekkes et al., 2003;
Monga et al., 2004), but it must be remembered that most of these
studies were not focused on variations among women with infertility
but comparisons to women without infertility. Our results suggest
that general measures of distress are useful for comparing women
with infertility to other populations, but fertility-specific measures
are more appropriate for assessing variability in experiences among
women who go through infertility (Jacob et al., 2007; Schmidt,
2009). FSD measures should therefore be useful in clinical practice
as a means of identifying women who are particularly distressed by
infertility. The recently developed FertiQoL (Boivin et al., 2010)
should be useful for this purpose. For those in need of a shorter
measure, the FSD scale employed here shows promise as a short
reliable measure for assessing variation in FSD. Future research
should explore the measurement properties of the FSD Scale as a
diagnostic tool.
As we hypothesized (Hypothesis iv), older women have higher FSD
levels than younger women. This finding is consistent with the experi-
ence of many caregivers of women and couples with infertility. As
women sense that their `biological clocks' are running down, they
are likely to experience fertility as even more urgent and unattainable,
and therefore more distressing. Yet our finding conflicts with that of
Abbey et al. (1992) who found no association between age and FSD
in a sample of treatment seekers. This discrepancy could result from
slightly different measures of FSD or from the difference in samples
(clinic versus population).
We hypothesized (Hypothesis v) that fertility-related variables, such
as family support and pressure, importance of motherhood and
wanting more children, should be associated with FSD. As previous
research (Gibson and Myers, 2002; Jacob et al., 2007; Slade et al.,
2007) has suggested, higher perceived social support is associated
with lower distress. Most of the `social pressure' variables did not
have significant associations with FSD. Encouragement by friends
and family to seek treatment was not associated with FSD in the treat-
ment only sample but was associated with higher FSD in the full
sample. We have not seen other reports that encouragement by
friends or family and partners is associated with higher FSD. This
finding suggests either that not all `support' from those in one's
social network is positive support or that those who have higher
FSD are more likely to elicit encouragement to seek medical treat-
ment. It is also likely that `encouragement' can seem like `pressure'
to those who do not seek medical help. Understanding how social
relationships can minimize or enhance distress among women with
infertility is an important area for additional research. Additionally,
women with infertility could benefit from counselors working to
help with strategies for managing relationships. As we expected,
women who attribute greater importance to motherhood and
women who desire more children exhibit higher levels of FSD than
women who place less importance on having children. This dovetails
with the finding of Abbey et al. (1992) that greater importance of chil-
dren is associated with greater distress.
Because general distress is not specific to the fertility experience,
we hypothesized (Hypothesis vi) that general distress would be less
sensitive to fertility-related variables and more sensitive to the stan-
dard demographic variables that are associated with distress in
general population studies. This hypothesis is partially supported in
this study. Employment, education and having private health insurance
are associated with lower general distress, although income is not. In
general, our analyses support the consistent finding that general
Variation in distress among women with infertility 2109
distress levels are lower with higher socioeconomic status (Phelan
et al., 2004). Although McQuillan et al. (2003) did not find that edu-
cation or employment modified the association between infertility
and general distress, their sample was much smaller than ours and
they were focused primarily on comparing women with infertility to
women without infertility rather than variations among women with
infertility. Of the variables other than demographic and resource vari-
ables, only social support and religiosity were associated with
CESD-10. Social support and religiosity were associated with well-
being in other studies (Coyne, 1991; Ellison, 1991; Thoits, 1995; Par-
gament, et al., 2005; Shreve-Neiger and Edelstein, 2004). That all of
the other variables were associated with CESD-10 in anticipated
ways suggests that the null findings for the infertility-specific variables
should be valid.
Researchers often emphasize statistically significant findings, but
unexpected non-significant findings are also worth noting. Most infer-
tility researchers know that women who identify as members of
racial/ethnic minority groups are overrepresented among women
with infertility and underrepresented among women pursuing infertility
treatment compared with white women (Bitler and Schmidt, 2006;
Chandra and Stephen, 2010). That indicators of race/ethnicity are
not associated with FSD suggests that the reason for lower treatment
rate is not because these groups are less distressed by infertility.
Therefore, we interpret this pattern as suggesting a serious unmet
need for infertility services among women who are members of
racial/ethnic minority groups.
We find no association between religiosity and FSD, similar to the
finding by Domar et al. (2005) who found that spiritual well-being was
not associated with FSD among women undergoing IVF. Mahajan et al.
(2009) found that intrinsic religiosity was associated with adjustment
to infertility, but our findings are not comparable because our religios-
ity measure did not distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic religios-
ity. Our finding that medical locus of control appears to conflict with
the finding by Koropatnick et al. (1993) that internal locus of control is
associated with higher infertility distress, but those authors used a
measure of general locus of control and did not specifically measure
medical locus of control.
It is striking that many of the variables that differentiated the more
distressed from the less distressed have to do with the meaning of
infertility. It seems plausible that infertility should be more distressing
for women who have never achieved a pregnancy because the specter
of involuntary childlessness should loom especially large for them. It
also seems plausible that infertility should be more distressing to
women who see themselves as having tried to become pregnant.
Greater intentionality should lead to greater distress when plans are
not realized. Alternatively, women who are distressed by not having
a child could come to consider themselves as `trying' rather than
ambivalent about becoming pregnant.
Women who are infertile with intent and have had no prior preg-
nancies stand out as a particularly distressed group. Note also that
women who place a higher value on motherhood have higher levels
of FSD. This suggests that how one understands or frames infertility
has important implications for levels of distress. Our findings suggest
that therapy oriented toward empowering clients to reassess the
meaning of infertility in their lives is a productive approach to coping
with infertility. These results also suggest that perceived social
pressure from family and friends can be perceived as distressing
rather than supportive. We agree with LeClair-Underberg (2008)
that empowering clients to tell friends and family what they need
from them should be more helpful than being angry, or isolating them-
selves from friends and family who seem insensitive.
We wish that we could establish causal order for several of the
associations identified in this study. For example, it is possible that per-
ceived pressure from family and friends leads to higher distress, but it
is also possible that women who are more distressed seek more
encouragement from others. Although it seems plausible that
women who place a higher value on motherhood will be more dis-
tressed when they are unable to achieve motherhood, it is also poss-
ible that higher levels of distress contribute to placing more value on
motherhood. Because we must rely here on cross-sectional data, the
causal ordering of these associations is difficult to assess. The problem
is compounded because we asked women to recall events in the past.
For example, we cannot know if self-reported intentionality actually
preceded behavior or whether it is a retrospective construction of
past events. It is plausible that women with greater intentionality
with regard to becoming pregnant are likely to experience higher
levels of FSD; it is also possible, however, that those who experience
more distress from infertility are more likely, in retrospect, to charac-
terize their episode as a time of explicit `trying'.
An additional shortcoming is that some concepts, such as FSD and
CESD-10, were measured at the time of the interview whereas other
variables refer to the time of the infertility episode. The associations
are thus likely to be weaker than if they had been measured during
the infertility episode. Although our analysis showed the same basic
findings for recent infertility episodes as for episodes occurring 6­
10 years ago, it is likely that for some women these responses
would have been different at the time of the episode than at the
time of the interview.
Despite these shortcomings, however, this study contributes to our
understanding of the psychosocial impact of infertility by providing
compelling evidence that FSD differs for women with infertility
depending on their type of infertility and intentionality with regard
to becoming pregnant. The use of a probability-based sample that
includes women who have not received tests or treatment represents
a major advance over most previous studies and lends our findings
greater generalizability.
Conclusion
Utilizing a large population-based sample has allowed us to test a
broader range of psychosocial responses to infertility episodes than
are usually found in fertility clinics, and it has enabled us to uncover
the importance of intentionality and infertility type as important pre-
dictors of FSD. Infertility type and intentionality with regard to preg-
nancy are both related to FSD, even after controlling for other
characteristics of women that should also be associated with FSD.
Therefore, we argue that it is important to know the characteristics
of infertility episodes in order to understand why women vary in
their experiences of infertility. A better comprehension of variation
in the experience of infertility should help caregivers to better under-
stand the needs of women with infertility, including those who are not
currently seeking or receiving services. Understanding variation in
psychological distress therefore calls for fertility-specific measures.
We hope our work will encourage more studies of women from non-
2110 Greil et al.
clinic samples, greater use of fertility-specific measures and a contin-
ued exploration of variation in the psychological concomitants of infer-
tility. We stress the benefits to women with infertility if counselors and
physicians recognize variation among women with infertility and the
need to understand what the experience means to women.
