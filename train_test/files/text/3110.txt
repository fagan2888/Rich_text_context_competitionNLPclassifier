SINCE THE 1970S, CONSIDERABLE
attention has been paid to the
possibility that low levels of lead
exposure among adults in the
general population can elevate blood
pressure and increase the risk for hy-
pertension, a leading risk factor for car-
diovascular disease morbidity and mor-
tality.1-3 Evidence for this association
from the epidemiological literature is
compelling,4 but the exact causal na-
ture of the relationship remains con-
troversial.
Thenotionthatleadexposuremayin-
fluence blood pressure in humans is bio-
logically plausible. Lead induces hyper-
tension in rats,5,6 and other animal data
suggest that lead acts at multiple sites
within the cardiovascular system, in-
cluding direct effects on the excitability
and contractility of the heart, alteration
ofthecomplianceofthevascularsmooth
muscle tissue, and direct action on parts
of the central nervous system respon-
sible for blood pressure regulation.2 Evi-
dence in animals also suggests that lead

rotoxic to humans, and alteration of

Context Lead exposures have been shown to be associated with increased blood
pressure and risk of hypertension in older men. In perimenopausal women, skeletal
lead stores are an important source of endogenous lead exposure due to increased
bone demineralization.
Objective To examine the relationship of blood lead level with blood pressure and
hypertension prevalence in a population-based sample of perimenopausal and post-
menopausal women in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional sample of 2165 women aged 40
to 59 years, who participated in a household interview and physical examination, from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1988 to 1994.
Main Outcome Measures Associations of blood lead with blood pressure and hy-
pertension, with age, race and ethnicity, cigarette smoking status, body mass index,
alcohol use, and kidney function as covariates.
Results A change in blood lead levels from the lowest (quartile 1: range, 0.5-1.6
µg/dL) to the highest (quartile 4: range, 4.0-31.1 µg/dL) was associated with small
statistically significant adjusted changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Women
in quartile 4 had increased risks of diastolic (90 mm Hg) hypertension (adjusted odds
ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.7), as well as moderately in-
creased risks for general hypertension (adjusted OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.92-2.0) and sys-
tolic (140 mm Hg) hypertension (adjusted OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.72-3.2). This asso-
ciation was strongest in postmenopausal women, in whom adjusted ORs for diastolic
hypertension increased with increasing quartile of blood lead level compared with quar-
tile 1 (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1-19.2 for quartile 2; adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI,
1.5-23.1 for quartile 3; adjusted OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.6-24.7 for quartile 4).
Conclusions At levels well below the current US occupational exposure limit guide-
lines (40 µg/dL), blood lead level is positively associated with both systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure and risks of both systolic and diastolic hypertension among women
aged 40 to 59 years. The relationship between blood lead level and systolic and dias-
tolic hypertension is most pronounced in postmenopausal women. These results pro-
vide support for continued efforts to reduce lead levels in the general population, es-
pecially women.

kidney function may precede the devel-
opment of hypertension.7,8 However,
whether lead affects blood pressure
through altering kidney function in hu-
mans is not known.
A case-control investigation of men
from the Normative Aging Study9 re-
ported significantly higher levels of lead
in skeletal and blood compartments
among men with hypertension com-
pared with normotensives. The all-
male study population had mean base-
line blood lead levels of 6.3 µg/dL,
similar to men in the general popula-
tion.10 An increase from the midpoint
of the lowest quintile to the highest
quintile of bone lead was associated
with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of
1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.1-1.8) for hypertension, suggesting
that cumulative lead exposure, repre-
sented by bone lead stores, may be an
independent risk factor for hyperten-
sion in the general population.9
Evidence suggests that bone lead
stores contribute to circulating levels
of lead in blood.11-13 In particular, blood
lead levels in women appear to increase
during the menopausal transition,
because of the mobilization of skeletal
leadstoresassociatedwithbonedemin-
eralization.14-18 Theimpactofthesesmall
but significant increases in blood lead
in postmenopausal compared with pre-
menopausal women is difficult to inter-
pret,becauserelativelyfewstudieshave
examined the health impacts of lead in
women. A case-control study7 of 297
women with hypertension who partici-
pated in the Nurses' Health Study
showed that increases in bone patella
leadlevelsfromthe10thtothe90thper-
centile were associated with increased
risks of hypertension (OR, 1.86, 95%
CI, 1.09-3.19). However, information
aboutmenopausalstatuswasextremely
limited in this study.7
The objective of our investigation was
toexaminetherelationshipofbloodlead
levels with blood pressure and hyper-
tension in a population-based sample of
perimenopausal and postmenopausal
women in the United States. We se-
lected blood pressure and hyperten-
sion as outcomes because of the epide-
miologicaldataassociatingrelativelylow
levels of lead in the blood with cardio-
vascular outcomes1,2,4,19-38 and because
hypertension is a significant health con-
cern for women after menopause.39
METHODS
The study population included women
from the Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES
III), a cross-sectional sample obtained
through a complex survey design, rep-
resenting the US civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population. During a 6-year
period (1988-1994), participants took
part in a household interview and an
in-depth physical examination with
laboratory tests. Full details of the sur-
vey design have been published by the
National Center for Health Statistics of
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.40
Our investigation focused on the sub-
set of 2574 women aged 40 to 59 years
who participated in the NHANES III
survey interview. From this group, 409
women were excluded for the follow-
ing reasons: 211 did not undergo a
physical examination or blood test-
ing; 77 did not have information about
blood lead levels; and 121 women of
ethnicity other than non-Hispanic
black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexi-
can American were excluded because
of small numbers in any single self-
reported category. The remaining 2165
women constituted the sample used.
Definitions
Blood Pressure and Hypertension. We
used the mean of 3 systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure measurements, all
of which were taken by a physician at
the end of the 4-hour physical exami-
nation that occurred in the NHANES
mobile examination center. Women
were categorized as hypertensive if any
of the following criteria were met: cur-
rent user of blood pressure medica-
tion (self-report), a systolic blood pres-
sure of 140 mm Hg or higher, or a
diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg
or higher. We also examined separate
dichotomous variables for systolic hy-
pertension and diastolic hypertension
using these cutoff values, excluding per-
sons who reported being treated for hy-
pertension. More details on measure-
ment of and outcomes related to blood
pressure and hypertension in NHANES
III have been published elsewhere.3
Blood Lead. Blood samples were ob-
tained by venipuncture during the
physical examination. Blood lead con-
centration was measured by graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectropho-
tometry at the laboratories of the Na-
tional Center for Environmental Health
at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The as-
say detection limit was 1.0 µg/dL. Each
sample analysis was performed in du-
plicate, and the mean of both measure-
ments was used in these analyses. All
blood lead levels less than 1.0 µg/dL
were assigned a value of 0.5 µg/dL to
be consistent with previous analyses of
NHANES III lead data by other inves-
tigators.10
MenopausalStatus.Womenwerecat-
egorized as premenopausal (ovarian
function intact), surgically menopausal
(both ovaries removed surgically be-
fore cessation of menses), and naturally
menopausal (nonsurgical cessation of
ovarian function). Women without his-
tories of reproductive surgery were clas-
sified as premenopausal if they re-
ported a menstrual period during the
previous 12 months and postmeno-
pausal if they did not. Women report-
ing having undergone hysterectomy
(without ovariectomy) within a month
of the last menstrual period were as-
signedamenopausalclassificationbased
on their age (51 years, premeno-
pausal; 51 years, naturally meno-
pausal). Women who underwent bilat-
eral ovariectomy within 1 month of the
date of the last menstrual period were
classified as surgically menopausal.
Women who underwent hysterectomy
or ovariectomy more than 1 month af-
ter the reported date of the last men-
strual period were classified as natu-
rally menopausal. A total of 101 women
could not be assigned a menopausal sta-
tus due to missing information.
Kidney Function. Serum creatinine
was measured because it is the most

specific of the 3 measures of kidney
function available in NHANES III (se-
rum creatinine, urinary creatinine clear-
ance, and blood urea nitrogen) and was
consistent with other recent studies of
the effects of lead on the kidney.41
Covariates. Information about race
and ethnicity (non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic white, and Mexican
American), age (years), cigarette smok-
ing history (current, former, or never),
family income, and education was ob-
tained from the household interview.
Information about body mass index
(BMI, calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height
in meters) and alcohol use (amount
consumed per week) was obtained from
the physical examination and exami-
nation-associated questionnaire, re-
spectively. A 4-level categorical vari-
able for weekly alcohol intake was
created with the following levels: none,
less than 1, 1 to 2, or 3 or more drinks
per week. The poverty income ratio, a
ratio of family income to the poverty
level income for a given family size ad-
justed to the poverty threshold for the
year of the interview, was used to cre-
ate a 3-level family income variable. A
participant was assigned a family in-
come higher than the poverty level if
the poverty income ratio was more than
1, at or lower than poverty if the pov-
erty income ratio was less than or equal
to 1, and missing if the survey partici-
pant did not report a family income
level. A 4-level education variable was
created on the basis of the number of
years of education reported by the sur-
vey participant (0-11 years=high
school; 12 years = completed high
school; 12-15 years=some college; and
16 years=completion of college or
higher).
Statistical Methods
Weusedmultiplelinearregressionmod-
els to examine the associations of blood
lead and menopausal status with sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressures.
Analyses that examined systolic and di-
astolicbloodpressureascontinuousout-
comevariablesexcludedthe368women
withhypertensionwhoweretreated.We
used multiple logistic regression to ex-
amine the risks of hypertension (gen-
eral, systolic, and diastolic) by catego-
rizing blood lead in terms of quartiles
and comparing those women in blood
lead quartiles 2, 3, and 4 with those in
quartile 1; these analyses were strati-
fied by menopausal status.
Models were constructed based on
outcomes known to be biologically as-
sociated with blood pressure (age, race
and ethnicity, BMI, and serum
creatinine), including the study vari-
able blood lead. Potential confound-
ing variables (education, poverty in-
come ratio, alcohol use, and cigarette
smoking status) were included if they
were found to be significantly associ-
ated with blood pressure outcomes in
any 1 of the models before the inclu-
sion of blood lead. Final regression co-
variates included age, race and ethnic-
ity, alcohol use, cigarette smoking
status, BMI, and kidney function.
Statisticalanalyseswereconductedus-
ing SAS version 6 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC), incorporating the examination
sampling weights of NHANES III.40 The
statistical software package SUDAAN
version 7.0 (Research Triange Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was
used to calculate SEs for the estimates,
accounting for both the weights and the
complex survey design. Linear regres-
sion coefficients reported are unstand-
ardized. The significance of regression
coefficients was evaluated using the
Wald 2 test. Statistical tests for trends
of categorical variables were carried out
in regression models by coding levels as
integers (scores) and evaluating tests for
significance on the slope of the regres-
sion line. Statistical tests with P.05
were considered statistically signifi-
cant. All estimates of proportions, re-
gression coefficients, and ORs are
weighted to the 1990 US Census popu-
lation.
RESULTS
Overall, the mean blood lead level for
women aged 40 to 59 years was 2.9 µg/
dL, and the means for the quartiles of
blood lead ranged from 1.0 µg/dL to 6.3
µg/dL in the lowest and highest quar-
tile, respectively (TABLE 1). Women in
the higher quartiles of blood lead tended
to be older, current smokers, regular
drinkers, poorer, less educated, and
more likely to be non-Hispanic black
than those in the lower quartiles. All of
these variables were significantly asso-
ciated with blood lead level.
Of the 2165 women in the sample,
604 were classified as hypertensive
based on their systolic and diastolic
blood pressures (n=231, untreated), as
well as whether they self-reported cur-
rently taking antihypertensive medica-
tions (n=373). Of those that were un-
treated (n=231), 123 had systolic
hypertension only, 30 had diastolic hy-
pertension only, and 78 had both sys-
tolic and diastolic hypertension. Of
those who were treated for hyperten-
sion (n=373), 202 had neither sys-
tolicnordiastolichypertension,102had
systolic hypertension only, 14 had di-
astolic hypertension only, 50 had both
systolic and diastolic hypertension, and
5 did not have a systolic or diastolic
blood pressure measurement during the
examination.
In these crude analyses, blood lead
quartile was significantly associated
with systolic blood pressure (P=.03)
but not diastolic blood pressure
(P=.86) (TABLE 2). A significant dose-
response existed between blood lead
quartileandgeneralhypertensionpreva-
lence,with19.4%ofwomenhavinggen-
eral hypertension in the lowest quar-
tilecomparedwith28.3%inthehighest
quartile. However, although dose-
responsetrendsappearedtoexist,blood
lead quartile was not significantly asso-
ciated specifically with systolic or dias-
tolic hypertension prevalence (P=.09
and P=.25, respectively).
Systolic and Diastolic
Blood Pressure
In multivariate analyses, blood lead was
significantly associated with both sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressures
(TABLE 3). In these regression mod-
els, a difference in blood lead levels be-
tween the lowest and highest quartiles
was associated with a difference of 1.7
mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and

1.4 mm Hg in diastolic blood pres-
sure, after adjustment for age, race and
ethnicity, cigarette smoking, BMI, al-
cohol use, and kidney function. Omis-
sion of the serum creatinine variable in
the multivariable models for blood lead
and blood pressure (both systolic and
diastolic) did not alter the signifi-
cance of the blood lead variable.

cluded increasing age, being non-
Hispanic black, having an alcohol in-
take of less than 1 drink per week, and

tiles of blood lead level relative to the
lowest quartile, the adjusted ORs of hy-
pertension were elevated but not sig-
nificantly(OR,1.3;95%CI,0.90-2.0and

of these associations for premeno-

women yielded similar results, with the
exception that serum creatinine was
strongly associated with general hyper-
tension in premenopausal women.
Systolic and Diastolic Hypertension
After similar adjustment, a weak asso-
ciation existed for untreated systolic hy-
pertension. For women in the fourth

menopausal women.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, this is the first study
to examine the effects of blood lead and
blood pressure in perimenopausal
women. After accounting for age, race
and ethnicity, alcohol intake, ciga-
rette smoking status, BMI, and kidney
function, we found a significant asso-
ciation between blood lead and sys-
tolic and diastolic hypertension preva-
lence among women aged 40 to 59 years
in the US population. We selected this
population to analyze the role of meno-
pausal status, which we and others have
shown can influence blood lead levels
in women.14-17,42,43 Furthermore, this is
the age range at which the risks for hy-
pertension increase markedly in wom-
en.39,44 Thehighestquartileofbloodlead
(mean, 6.3 µg/dL) was associated with
a 3.4-fold increase in the risks of dias-
tolic hypertension (95% CI, 1.3-8.7)
relative to those in the lowest blood lead
quartile (mean, 1.0 µg/dL). These risks
were considerably higher for postmeno-
pausal women. In addition, blood lead
was a significant, positive predictor of
both elevated systolic and diastolic
blood pressure in these women. A dif-
ference in blood lead levels between the
lowest quartile and the highest quar-
tile was associated with a difference of
1.7 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure
and 1.4 mm Hg in diastolic blood pres-
sure. Blood lead is among the few pre-
dictors of both systolic and diastolic
blood pressures in perimenopausal US
women. Per unit change, blood lead was
a stronger predictor of diastolic blood
pressure than age.
The results are consistent with those
of Korrick et al,7 who found an asso-
ciation between self-reported hyper-
tension and bone lead in older women.
In a study of 45-year-old women liv-
ing in Copenhagen County, Den-
mark, higher blood lead levels were as-
sociated with elevated diastolic blood
pressure.29 Neither study accounted for
menopausal status in either blood lead
level or hypertension analyses.
In analyses of systolic and diastolic
blood pressures, the relationship be-
tweenbloodleadandbloodpressurewas
not stronger for blacks than for whites,
nor did blood lead levels explain racial
differences in hypertension preva-
lence. In fact, the blood lead and hyper-
tension relationships reported ap-
peared to be less pronounced among
blacks compared with the cohort as a
whole. However, stratification of the co-
hort by race and ethnicity resulted in
small sample sizes in each blood lead
quartile, limiting precision.
The associations of blood lead with
systolic and diastolic hypertension were
much more pronounced for postmeno-
pausal women than for premenopausal
women. The reasons for this associa-
tion are unclear. Postmenopausal
women may be more sensitive to the hy-
pertensive effects of lead because of loss
ofestrogenatmenopause.44 Estrogenhas
been postulated to protect women from
age-related increases in blood pres-
sure,44 although results from a large
randomized clinical trial have not sup-
ported this hypothesis.45 This observa-
tion also may reflect complex relation-
ships between bone lead and blood lead,
whicharealteredbythechangesinbone
mineral metabolism that accompany the
menopausal transition.
Whether lead affects blood pressure
through altering kidney function in hu-
mans is not known. Lead is nephro-
toxic to humans, and alteration of
kidney function may precede the devel-
opment of hypertension.7,8 Kidney func-
tion, as measured by serum creatinine,
was found to be significantly positively
associated with both systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressures in premeno-
pausal women who are untreated for

hypertension. Perhaps this reflects that
the kidney can be a common pathway
for blood pressure regulation, and the
effect of lead on the kidney is only part
oftherelationshipbetweenkidneyfunc-
tion and blood pressure. However, con-
trolling for kidney function did not re-
duce the association of blood lead with
blood pressure and hypertension, as
would be expected if kidney function
were along the causal pathway. In the
present investigation, serum creatinine
was both a sensitive and significant pre-
dictor of general hypertension in pre-
menopausal women. For every unit in-
crease in serum creatinine, the risks of
hypertensionincreasedmorethan7-fold
(OR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.7-32.7). However,
a significant association between lead
andgeneralhypertensionwasnotfound.
The mechanisms of lead-induced hy-
pertension are not well-characterized,
even in animal models. One hypoth-
esis is that lead induces hypertension
through direct effects on the kidney. A
recentretrospectivestudyof509healthy
participants of the Normative Aging
Study found blood lead levels to be sig-
nificantly positively correlated with se-
rum creatinine levels.41 A study of lead-
exposed workers, with high blood lead
levels (mean, 37 µg/dL), reported in-
creases in diastolic blood pressure and
in levels of urinary biomarkers for re-
nal function.7 Batuman et al46 reported
that patients with essential hyperten-
sionwhohadreducedrenalfunctionhad
significantly more chelatable lead than
those with essential hypertension with
normal renal function.
In the present study, kidney func-
tion measured by serum creatinine did
not appear to mediate the associations
between blood lead and blood pres-
sure. Thus, lead may act on blood pres-
sure through effects on the vasculature
or central nervous system, or more sen-
sitive measures of renal function may
be required to test mechanistic hypoth-
eses.However,Staessen47 reportednoas-
sociation between renal markers of lead
toxicity and blood pressure in a large
cohort study of women. The magni-

pressure observed in this study are simi-
lar to previous investigations, includ-
ing 1 study of women.29
Severalcross-sectional21-24,29-31,33,48 and
prospective29,31,35 population-basedstud-
ies on the association of lead with sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressures have
been performed from the mid-1980s.
The results of these studies have been
mixed, but there is considerable con-
cordance with the directionality of the
observed associations, with most con-
sistently finding a weak-positive asso-
ciationbetweenbloodleadandbothsys-
tolicanddiastolicbloodpressureinmen,
women, blacks, and whites.4 A meta-
analysis by Schwartz38 of 15 studies of
lead and systolic blood pressure in men
estimated that a change in blood lead
from 5 to 10 µg/dL was associated with
an increase of 1.5 mm Hg in systolic
blood pressure (95% CI, 0.87-1.63
mm Hg), which compares well with the
corresponding estimate from our study
(1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.97-2.20). The
adjusted ORs from multiple logistic re-
gressionmodelsperformedseparatelyfor
premenopausal and postmenopausal
women (Table 5) show a consistent, al-
though not always significant, dose-
response relationship between blood
lead quartile and risks of hypertension.
These subgroup analyses resulted in
smaller numbers of women in the mod-
els, and this is reflected in the wide CIs
in some of the estimates.
The conventional predictors of blood
lead in the current US population have
been published in a previous NHANES
III analysis by Brody et al.10 Other non-
bone density­related exposures that can
result in elevated blood lead levels in
the United States include residential ex-
posure to lead paint, residential prox-
imity to a lead smeltering facility, oc-
cupational exposure (lead smelter,
battery manufacturing, welding, or
bridge painting), cigarette smoking, and
alcohol intake.15 Those variables asso-
ciated with lead and also known to be
associated with blood pressure and hy-
pertension (ie, potential confound-
ers) were adjusted for in the blood lead
and blood pressure and hypertension
analyses of our study.
The human skeleton is a dynamic
physiological compartment of min-
eral metabolism. Women lose as much
as 50% of trabecular bone and 30% of
cortical bone during their lifetime, and
30% to 50% of this bone loss occurs in
the early postmenopausal years.49-53 Es-
trogen deficiency appears to play a sig-
nificant role in bone loss.51,54
Observational evidence suggests that
lead may be mobilized from the skel-
eton during periods of increased bone
demineralization, such as during preg-
nancy and lactation,12,55-57 very old age,58
and menopause.14-16,59 Two cross-
sectional studies14,15 of US women that
were performed using data from the sec-
ond NHANES (NHANES II, 1976-
1980) and the Hispanic HANES (1982-
1984)documentedthatpostmenopausal
women have significantly higher blood
lead levels than premenopausal women,
controlling for age and other factors re-
lated to exogenous lead exposure. An-
other study59 also identified meno-
pausal status as an independent
predictor of blood lead levels in a ran-
dom sample of Scandinavian women.
Hu et al60 noted that bone lead may
be a more appropriate marker of lead
exposure for chronic disease out-
comes such as hypertension. The pres-
ent study is a cross-sectional study in
that the exposures and the outcomes
weremeasuredsimultaneously.Therel-
evant exposures affecting blood pres-
sure and hypertension may occur
months or years before the observed
effect. For example, the average BMI
during the 5 years preceding the blood
pressure measurement may have more
explanatory power than BMI mea-
suredonthesamedayasthebloodpres-
sure. Likewise, cumulative lead expo-
sure during the preceding decade, bone
lead burden, or serum creatinine may
be more predictive of blood pressure
than blood lead level measured on the
same day as blood pressure. Evidence
suggests that bone lead stores can con-
tribute to circulating levels of lead in
blood.11-13
The findings of our study are incon-
sistent with the notion of a latency pe-
riod of months to years between the on-
setofperimenopausalbonelossresulting
in increased endogenous lead expo-
sure, followed by a chronic effect of lead
on blood pressure. A study by Cake et
al61 suggests that bone lead released into
thebloodmaybemorebioavailablethan
lead resulting from environmental ex-
posure. Therefore, if blood lead in peri-
menopausal women is more driven by
bone lead levels, it is possible that blood
lead levels may be a more sensitive pre-
dictorofbloodpressureoutcomesinthis
population, because it represents liber-
ated skeletal lead stores.
Important methodological chal-
lenges exist in observational studies of
lead exposure and blood pressure and
hypertension. First, if an association be-
tween lead exposure and blood pres-
sure exists, lead is most likely respon-
sible for a relatively small effect on
blood pressure, and thus, this associa-
tion may be difficult to consistently as-
certain in different populations. Sec-
ond, when examining small effects, the
issue of residual confounding, beyond
that which is controlled in the analy-
sis, becomes extremely important. In
such cases, what may be interpreted as
a small effect of blood lead on blood
pressure may actually be due to inad-
equate control of confounding fac-
tors. However, the restricted age range
chosen for this investigation helps to
minimize the effect of confounding by
age, which is strongly related to blood
lead, blood pressure, and hyperten-
sion. Third, because the mechanisms by
which lead may act on blood pressure
in humans are not well understood, in-
vestigators may tend to include more
covariates than necessary in their mod-
els or use mechanical, stepwise ap-
proaches to modeling. The true size of
the effect may be decreased by over-
controlling. This is a particular prob-
lem in studies of environmental lead ex-
posure, because blood lead levels are
highly correlated with race and ethnic-
ity, income, and education,10 which also
may be risk factors for outcomes such
as hypertension.49
Whether bone or blood is the appro-
priate biomarker for lead exposure in
studies of chronic disease outcomes is

relatively recent exposures to lead.
Hypertensioninadultsthatmaybeasso-
ciatedwithpastexposurestoleadiscon-
sistent with a follow-up study of lead-
poisonedchildreninwhomtherisksfor
hypertension were significantly higher
than they were in controls matched by
age, sex, race and ethnicity, and neigh-
borhood.50 Bone lead is a more appro-
priate marker for chronic exposure;
however, its interpretation depends on
an understanding of bone physiology
and events such as pregnancy and
menopause.11 Future studies of blood
pressure and hypertension should con-
sider blood lead and bone lead as inde-
pendent factors influencing the risk for
hypertension.
The R2 values in Table 3 suggest that
the models explain 22% and 14% of the
variation in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, respectively. We interpret this
to mean that much of the variation in
blood pressure is random or due to un-
known or immeasurable factors. Be-
cause blood pressure has been so well
studied, it is unlikely that there are un-
discovered factors responsible for the
remaining unexplained variation.
Other factors that contribute to the
variation in blood lead levels observed
in our study include measured and un-
measured aspects of conventional and
bonedensity­relatedpredictorsofblood
lead, as well as other variables that were
not measured by NHANES. However,
we controlled for all of the known fac-
tors associated with blood pressure and
hypertention,3 including alcohol in-
take. This approach presumably mini-
mizes residual confounding of our es-
timate of the associations of blood lead
with blood pressure and hypertension.
Vital status data are not yet avail-
able on the NHANES III cohort. How-
ever, a recent analysis of men and
women from the NHANES II cohort by
Lustberg and Silbergeld62 found el-
evated blood lead levels to be associ-
ated with a dose-related increase in
deaths due to hypertension-related
coronary heart disease and stroke for
both men and women. Although the
timing of NHANES II resulted in higher
blood lead levels than our data in our
population, the effects observed in our
study also suggest that lead acts on the
cardiovascular system and much lower
levels in the blood.
From a public health perspective, the
most important and troubling implica-
tion of these findings is that lead ap-
pears to increase blood pressure in
women at very small increments above
1.0 µg/dL, well below what is consid-
ered deleterious in adults. The mean
blood lead level in this sample of
women was 2.9 µg/dL. These results
demonstrate effects of lead at levels less
than the US occupational blood lead ex-
posure limits (40 µg/dL) and even less
than the current Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention level of con-
cern for preventing lead poisoning in
children (10 µg/dL). Finally, the find-
ings from our study of associations of
blood lead with systolic and diastolic
hypertensionandbloodpressureamong
women in the general population lend
support for further studies on the health
effects of bone lead mobilization dur-
ing the menopausal transition. These
results provide support for continued
efforts to reduce lead levels in the gen-
eral population, especially women.
