Abstract
This article examines global social policy formation in the area of skilled migration,
with a focus on the Gulf Arab region. Across the globe, migration governance presents
challenges to multiple levels of authority; its complexity crosses many scales and involves
a multitude of actors with diverse interests. Despite this jurisdictional complexity,
migration remains one of the most staunchly defended realms of sovereign policy
control. Building on global social policy literature, this article examines how `domestic'
labour migration policies reflect the entanglement of multiple states' and agencies'
interests. Such entanglements result in what we characterize as a `multiplex system',
where skilled-migration policies are formed within, and shaped by, globalized policy
spaces. To illustrate, we examine policies that shape the nursing labour market in Oman
during a period when the state aims to transition from dependence on an expatriate to
an increasingly nationalized labour force. Engaging a case-study methodology including
a survey of migrant healthcare workers, semi-structured interviews and data analysis,
we find that nursing labour markets in Oman represent an example of global policy
formation due to the interaction of domestic and expatriate labour policies and
provisioning systems. The transnational structuring of policy making that emerges
reflects a contingent process marked by conflicting outcomes. We contend that Oman's
nursing labour market is an example of new spaces where global social policies emerge
from the tension of competing national state and market interests.

Introduction
The globalized nursing labour market of Oman provides an example of the deterritoriali-
zation of national social policy while illuminating how global policies emerge in new, but
fuzzy and contested, regulatory spaces. Global migration is one of the most prominent
global social policy issues of the time, with over 250million people living outside of their
country of birth. Over 38% of this stock is characterized as south­south migrants, which
now exceeds south­north migrant numbers (World Bank, 2016: 1). From South East Asia
to Europe to the United States, migration governance presents challenges to multiple lev-
els of authority. Its complexity crosses multiple scales and involves a multitude of actors
with diverse and often conflicting interests and realms of authority. Migration has been a
key feature of the global economy for centuries, yet international migration remains one
of the most staunchly defended realms of sovereign policy control. We argue that in the
area of skilled migration, we need to understand how globalization has informed global
social policy with an eye to the heterogeneity of state and market entanglements and their
outcomes in contexts marked by transnational engagements outside of core OECD (The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) nations (Yeates, 2001).
The case of Oman demonstrates how skilled migrant labour market interactions are
shaped by multilevel, interstate and regional state engagement processes, along with a
multiplicity of nonstate stakeholders all simultaneously engaged in some aspect of labour
policy while subject to differing levels of autonomy, regulation and control. In this arti-
cle, we engage the word multiplex to denote the multiple agents (state and market based)
that are variably interconnected, generating intense complexity in this policy space (cf.
Wedel, 1998). The migration of nurses has previously been shown to be a realm of com-
plex globalized multi-state and agency interactions (Kingma, 2006; Yeates, 2009). In the
case of Oman, the main actors include the governments of Oman and migrant sending
nations (the Philippines in the context of this article), their relevant government minis-
tries and Embassies, employers (public, private and hybrids of these), intermediaries that
facilitate migration, civil society and the expatriate and Omani workers themselves.
Global social policy formation in the transnational political
economy of care
Policies that frame how international migrants are incorporated into overseas labour
markets illustrate the `three R's of global social policy, redistribution, regulation, and
rights' (Deacon and Stubbs, 2013: 6). In cases of feminized migration, such as nursing,
we also enter debates over the political economy of global care services (Yeates, 2009),
which includes the dynamic movement of care labour, the nature of care commitments,
the movement of care capital, the type of care discourses that frame policies and how
non-governmental organizations (NGO) and social movements are influential in related
social policy discussions taking place at different scales (Williams, 2011: 25). Our
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 171
argument supports the idea that public policies are formed within ­ and their outcomes
shaped by ­ globalized policy processes, `complex multilateralism' and transnational
networks that represent a `mechanism of global public policy'(Stone, 2008: 34, 35). This
argument also emerges in global social policy approaches that explore `the complexities
of the actions of transnational, international and global actors within national and regional
spaces' (Deacon and Stubbs, 2013:11). Our article adds context and empirical flesh to
this conceptual framework.
Specifically, we examine how nursing labour markets in the Sultanate of Oman rep-
resent an example of global social policy formation due to the interaction of domestic
and expatriate labour provisioning systems, resulting in the transnational integration of
multiple national policy processes. We contend that Oman's nursing labour market pro-
vides an example of `new public spaces where global policies occur' (Stone, 2008: 19)
and how `key policy players are transcending "levels" at any one moment' (Deacon and
Stubbs, 2013: 10). Furthermore, our article illustrates Yeates' (2002) claim that a `multi-
plicity of actors ­ economic agents such as transnational corporations (TNCs), national
states and various national and local interests ­ interact in various ways, at various levels,
and with various outcomes, none of which are predetermined' (p. 87).
A multitude of policies frame nursing labour market formation globally (Kingma,
2006), but in Oman a gendered political economy structures nursing markets in interest-
ing ways. Similar to its Gulf neighbours, Oman's economy has been heavily reliant on
hydrocarbons and foreign labour, but as demographic and economic conditions change,
Oman faces the need to transition from a rentier state serviced by expatriate workers, to a
country engaged in educating and promoting the employment of its population (Zerovec
and Bontenbal, 2011). During this transition, the `Gulf paradox' has emerged of labour
markets with increasing numbers of non-nationals, while nationals (particularly young
people and women) experience increasing rates of unemployment. In Oman's nursing
sector, this labour market complexity includes the interaction of nationalization and
skilled-migration labour policies. We examine this complexity in the following three sec-
tions. First, we provide an overview of our methodological approach and research meth-
ods. Second, we make the case for Oman's nursing labour market as a space for global
social policy formation, and we organize this in four subsections. The first subsection
examines health care and health labour governance in Oman. The second highlights
labour recruitment and workplace processes arranged between Oman and the Philippines
­ a key supplier of nursing labour to Oman ­ while paying attention to some of the key
players and the means by which they engage. The third provides more detail of the multi-
plex nature of the nursing labour market by examining its gendered political economy.
The fourth examines the actors involved in policy interaction in Oman and how this con-
tributes to the generation of global social policy. In the final section, we review how
understanding the multiplex space of Oman's nursing labour market, with the contingent
and contested interactions involved, illustrates a mode of global social policy formation.
Research methods
We employ a methodological transnationalism approach by foregrounding the nature of
cross border links, structure and agency in order to overcome territoriality and the
172 Global Social Policy 18(2)
conflation of state, society and territory (Amelina et al., 2014: 11). Transnational analysis
reveals how care migration policies are co-determined by actors operating beyond or
across their national borders, thereby illustrating the value of methodological transna-
tionalism during a period of increased global care migration (Yeates, 2014b).
Methodological transnationalism thus escapes the tendency of analysis to begin and end
with the nation, thereby revealing how global social policy is increasingly being formed
at scales beyond the nation, for example, through regional collaborations such asASEAN
(Yeates, 2014a). Thus, we engage a methodological transnational approach to reveal
overlapping nascent informal inter-regional networks that shape and inform migration
and labour market regulation in Oman.
To address the complexity evident in Oman's nursing labour market, and to develop
our interpretation of its construction as evidence of a form of global social policy, we
utilized a range of research methods and forms of data collection. Using an online survey
developed in consultation with colleagues at the Centre for Development Studies in
India, we gathered data from expatriate nurses in Oman. The survey results demonstrate
the interaction of labour and migration policy through the lived experience of healthcare
workers in Oman. The research also entailed three field visits to Oman by Ennis in 2014
and 2015. Eventually, after promoting the online survey though our connections with
networks in Oman, we gathered 25 responses from nurses working in Oman, 23 from the
Philippines and 2 from India. For the purposes of this article, we consider only the
Philippine respondents. We also conducted seven key informant interviews in Oman,
including subsequent telephone calls and multiple informal (off-the-record) meetings
with government officials from both Oman and the Philippines and with Omani nurses.
The analysis was further supplemented with secondary data evaluation and review.
Oman's nursing labour market as a space for global social
policy formation
Situated on the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean,
Oman's embeddedness within migration flows in the region has deep historical roots. It
has been integrated into the Indian Ocean economy for generations (Chaudhuri, 1985).
In the current period, there are multiple layers and sites of authority which intersect in
complicated ways to govern the flow of migrants into the nursing labour market and their
labour within it.
The contemporary governance of migration in Oman, like other parts of the Arab
Gulf, is connected to the neoliberalizing tendencies of global capital, with labour flows
serving the demands of global capitalism and global production networks. Long-standing
labour demand patterns in hydrocarbon-dependent Gulf economies have produced a
strong dependence on foreign labour. Demand for service labour is a regular feature of
rentier economies where the growing consumption needs of the national middle class
manifests itself in highly segmented labour markets that selectively draw from interna-
tional supplies of low-, semi- and high-skilled labour.
Over 60% of Oman's workforce is non-national whose residence in the country is tied
to their work contract (Census, 2010). Globalized migration in Oman is distinguished by
a lack of integration and citizenship and is structured by the kafala (sponsorship) system
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 173
which binds the migrant to their employer (Sater, 2014). Irrespective of skill level, eco-
nomic migrants in Oman remain legally temporary despite their frequent longevity or
even generational presence in the country. The temporariness of the expatriate experi-
ence, even when a lifetime of work is conducted in the country, impacts the relationship
of the individual with their host country, their home country and their work more broadly.
This tension is exacerbated in lived experiences of long term, yet temporary migrants
even when those migrants are highly skilled. A sense of impermanence and limit to rights
on belonging contribute to the circular production of insecurity, which in turn influences
how sending countries manage outward migration and their diplomatic relations with
Oman.
One of the key policies aimed at trying to reduce Oman's dependence on foreign
workers is Omanization, a labour localization programme aimed at promoting the
employment of citizens through quota systems, training initiatives and other incentive
schemes (Ennis and Al-Jamali, 2014: 6). It is an economy-wide policy which was born
of necessity, geared towards employment burden sharing when oil revenues were low,
but meeting limited success in the private sector. Despite government plans since the late
1980s to reduce the number of foreigners in the workforce, expatriate numbers have
increased and even surged in the last decade (National Centre for Statistics and
Information [NCSI], 2010­2013). Only the recent oil price crash seems to be dampening
this trend. Although the Omani government has been successful in its efforts to reduce
the reliance on expatriates in the government, public education and the banking sectors,
most others, especially in the private sector, remain dominated by expatriates.
Since Omanization is a state-led initiative, it is not surprising that the public sector has
led the way in increasing the share of Omani employees. The private sector, on the con-
trary, has proven more resistant to Omanization. Business actors maintain a preference
for less expensive, more flexible workers in the low-skilled sector and in high-skilled
foreign labour. Data from 2015 show that 81% of expatriates working in the Sultanate
work in the private sector, whereas only 4% work in the public sector and 15% are
located in the household sector (NCSI, 2015: 18). The same data show that 88.4% of the
private sector is non-national, which is up from 81.7 in 2006 (NCSI, 2015: 20). This
trend continues despite policy efforts to encourage a stronger national presence in the
private sector workforce. Policy levers competing for government attention include the
pressures of global competitiveness, on one hand, and the need to protect the domestic
workforce, on the other. Gulf States have therefore been caught between `the aspirations
of the modernist welfare state and the goals of capital accumulation' (Al-Shehabi, 2015:
25). The desire for a modernist welfare state is well illustrated by Oman's efforts to pro-
vide improved health care.
Health care and health labour governance in Oman
There have been drastic improvements in health care across the Sultanate since the
1970s. A change in head of state in 1970 coincided with a sudden influx of export earn-
ings following the 1973 oil embargo. These incidents marked the beginning of a new
impetus for improving development indicators across the country, including those in
health, and meeting the aspirations of capital accumulation alongside enhanced welfare
174 Global Social Policy 18(2)
provision. In 1975, the total number of nurses across Oman was 450. This increased to
4147 by 1990, 7829 by 2000 and 15,627 by 2012 (Ministry of Health [MOH], 2014:
123). Alongside this, investment in education became a major component of improving
healthcare provision nation-wide. Medical education only began in Oman in 1986 when
the College of Medicine and Health Sciences was established at Sultan Qaboos University
(MOH, 2014: 127­128). Before this, Omani students had to travel abroad to receive
medical training. As in other sectors, the rapid demand for healthcare provision meant
healthcare workers had to be hired from abroad while simultaneously increasing the
number of locals educated in the health field.
A similar pattern transpired in many sectors of the economy, where labour was
imported to fill a numerical and skill shortage. As the population grew and income levels
rose, demand for labour also increased, especially in services. During the oil price decline
and economic stagnation of the late 1980s and 1990s, it became clear to policy makers
that mechanisms were required to encourage Omani citizens to work in a wider array of
fields and especially in the private sector, thereby reducing the reliance on expatriates.
Since the 1990s, concerted efforts by the government to educate and train Omanis in
health care have resulted in significant changes. When the term Omanization came into
common use in the early 1990s, Omanis were not well represented in the healthcare sec-
tor. Despite significant improvements, the ambitious Omanization goals laid out in 1995
in the long-term development strategy Oman Vision 2020, and in subsequent 5-year
development plans, have not been reached. According to the Omanization of Health
Manpower Plan 2006, the MOH expected the nursing category to be 100% Omanized by
2015. MOH suggested this could happen if the Ministry had the ability to distribute nurs-
ing graduates across various governorates according to need.
Although institutions managed by the MOH have had the most success in localizing
the nursing workforce (see Tables 1 and 2), none of the governorates have reached 100%
Omani employment. Such policy goals were too ambitious from the outset, given popu-
lation numbers and distribution across the regions, as well as local social norms associ-
ated with female employment. As in other areas of the economy, public sector health
institutions have been more successful than private sector ones, which are largely for-
eign-managed. In fact, Omanis only comprise 5% of the nursing staff in private health-
care facilities. In contrast, Omani employees comprise 66% of all MOH institutions,
ranging from 6% in the remote region ofAl-Wusta to 91% inAl-Dhahirah. Outside of the
capital area, the higher number of Omani nurses appears to reflect the presence of

regional nursing educational institutes, with Al-Sharqiyah, Al-Batinah and Al-Dhahirah
home to several nursing institutes (MOH, 2013).
To compensate for the lack of local nursing graduates, Oman's expansion of health
services depended upon the use of expatriate nurses, the majority coming from India and
the Philippines. Between 2007 and 2011, the number of new Filipino hires deployed to
Oman doubled, and by 2015, Oman was among the top 10 destinations for Philippine
overseas workers (POEA, 2011, 2015). Notwithstanding these increases, the ambitious-
ness of Omanization plans in the healthcare sector alarms some foreign nurses in the
country and adds to their sense of precarity and worry. The policy of Omanization effec-
tively intensifies the vulnerability embedded in Oman's migration labour policy, since it
enhances migrant insecurity even while migrant workers are still needed in the sector.
Survey results indicate that 60% of respondents were worried about Omanization forcing
them out of their job:
Yes, especially when you are already over age to transfer to other counties for work (Survey
response 2014).
Even if you have specialized here with so many years of experience, they can easily take you
out even with exemplary work performance. Then you will be left unemployed (Survey
response 2014).
Our respondents assess their vulnerability within a transnational field of options, because
they understand losing a job in Oman means they would have to find employment in
another country, as opposed to merely returning home:
Because if Omanization will push through, I have to look for another country that will offer me a job
(Survey response 2014).
The failure of the Philippines to offer some kind of return options to nurses interacts with
the Omanization policy to enhance the sense of precarity. Even if migrants are allowed

to continue to work in Oman, the Omanization processes were interpreted through con-
cerns over possible changes in workplace controls and hierarchy:
They [Omanis] will be the head of every group. And it will depend on the attitude of that Omani
if he or she will not discriminate his or her colleagues, especially expatriates (Survey response
2014).
Notwithstanding these concerns, 40% of survey respondents were not overly worried
about Omanization. Some seemed confident that their work ethic and willingness to
work longer hours than Omani nursing staff would help secure their employment:
Some work schedules cannot be catered by Omanis, so they need expatriates to do the work
(Survey response 2014).
These comments suggest that Omanization can work as a social policy of control over
labour even when it has effectively `failed' to fully nationalize the labour force in ques-
tion. The reality of this failure was evident in the responses of several participants, who
reported a visible increase in the number of foreign healthcare professionals in Oman
since 2011. This corresponds with the recorded annual increases in the number of non-
nationals added to the labour market and general decline in the level of Omanization
(NCSI, 2010­2013). In one interview with a Philippine nurse who had been in Oman for
nearly a decade, he claimed,
It used to be about 50/50 expats/locals in the hospitals. The government is doing a good job
investing in local people to work in this field. Sure, there are some work or quality issues, but
it is developing. We used to be worried about Omanization taking over, but not now. A strange
thing happened in the last three years. In all the hospitals, the number of expatriates shot up.
Recruitment has been very high, and now we are more than the locals. (19 June 2014)
Philippine Embassy staff noted a similar perception, expecting numbers of Philippine
nurses to continue increasing. MOH (2015: 12) data confirm a decline in Omanization
levels from 2010 to 2015. Embassy staff seemed to believe that there was an increasing
demand for Filipinos in Oman because they were deemed more qualified and better
trained. As much as Oman may want to nationalize the labour force in health care, these
trends suggest there remains a need for well-trained expatriate labour within the Omani
healthcare sector. This intersection of healthcare service demands, training and staffing
need, and the effectiveness of regional migrant labour provisioning systems suggests
labour nationalization policies will not be fully achieved for some time. Despite this, the
mere presence of an Omanization policy can be considered to do the work of regulating
migrant labour by maintaining a sense of insecurity even as the number of expatriates
recruited increases.
Gendered political economy of the nursing labour market in Oman
In the case of Oman, as with many Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, the issue
of gender norms and patriarchal governance is profoundly relevant to the operation of the
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 177
labour market and how social policy is imagined and achieved in practice. Contrary to
stereotypes, women in the Gulf graduate from universities and other higher educational
institutes at higher rates than men (Al-Nasr, 2011: 43, 46). However, high youth unem-
ployment rates characteristic of the region disproportionately impact women (OECD
2014: 43­44). Despite significant investment in education and health, and despite devel-
opment indicators (such as female education, fertility and life expectancy) that favoura-
bly compare to other regions, women's labour force participation remains low. This is
what the World Bank (2004) has labelled the `gender paradox' in the Middle East.
Notwithstanding this so-called paradox, societal norms in the Gulf states around wom-
en's role in society `drastically transformed'over the last generation (Al-Nasr, 2011: 44).
Female participation in the Omani labour force has expanded significantly in the past
three decades; increasing from 7.6% in 1980 to 29% in 2013 (see Table 3).
GCC governments that seek to promote the education and employment of their
national labour force must reconcile the abnormal national/non-national segmented char-
acteristic of Gulf labour markets, and the concomitant gender imbalances that result,
with the necessity to facilitate the integration of national women into the labour market.
With a majority of workers in the private sector being non-national and male, female
employment in this sector remains difficult. Nursing, however, is globally a feminized
profession.
The internationalization of the healthcare labour force interacts with nursing's gen-
dered and insecure occupational status (Nelson and Gordon, 2004). This professional
marginalization is evident in many parts of the Middle East, where `nurses are consid-
ered maids for patients and assistants for physicians' (Al Jarallah et al., 2009: 70). To
further add to this complexity, the actual autonomy of female nurses ­ working with
unrelated men, sometimes at night and engaged in `body work' that demands touch and
personal care ­ challenges the gender norms of socially conservative societies (El-Hadad,
2006). The ambiguous status of the nursing profession means that in Oman `the majority
of students entered into nursing as their last choice of preferences' (Al-Riyami et al.,
2015: 464). Increased university level training has, however, boosted the desirability of
the profession for young Omanis (Al-Riyami et al., 2015). In fact, Omani nurses spoken
with during this research suggested that nursing was their top choice. This may be partly
connected to the expectation of a de facto guaranteed job after graduation; Omanization
rates are higher in areas with higher local unemployment (Table 2). Here, many local

women work as nurses, since labour demand outpaces supply and employment opportu-
nities mean Omani nurses can find jobs rather quickly after graduation.
Nursing, especially in the public sector, is slowly emerging as an appropriate field for
Omani women. In 2013, women represented 81.6% of the current students enrolled in
MOH nursing institutes (MOH, 2013: 12­13). A female Omani ward supervisor at a
government hospital, and nurse for over 12 years, believed the biggest problems facing
her hospital were staff shortages and high levels of Omani staff turnover (interview, 11
January 2015). She felt that low pay, long hours and limited opportunity for promotion
discouraged Omani nurses from staying in one hospital for a long time. Interviewees also
suggested that many male Omani nurses do not remain in patient care for long, preferring
instead to shift to administrative roles, a pattern that is evident for male nurses generally
(Dill et al., 2016).
National nurses in Oman support the Omanization process, but have expressed concern
about replacing experienced expatriate nurses too rapidly with inexperienced and poorly
trained national nurses (Al-Riyami et al., 2015). The supervisor mentioned above expressed
this sentiment as well. She was worried about the level of experience of new graduates
coming in and wished administrators would not replace the more experienced, and more
expensive, expatriates with fresh graduates. The multiple interests and complexities at
work in this realm of social policy making are clearly articulated in this case. While Oman
has a stated interest in boosting the employment of female nationals, gendered expectations
and poor conditions of nursing employment undermine the profession's acceptability and
limit its capacity to attract and retain locals. The demands made of the healthcare sector and
the recognition of skills and expertise, meanwhile, protect migrant workers as key actors in
this sector. The perceived threat of Omanization, however, can still operate to control
migrant workers and contain demands for improved conditions.
Labour recruitment and workplace experience between Oman and the
Philippines
Health labour force policy in Oman is informed by policy frameworks originating in
both Oman and health professional migrant source regions. This is a clear example of
global social policy making since multiple states and agents become enmeshed in the
process of migrant worker provisioning to service Oman's needs. Oman's MOH has
guidelines for international staffing requests, whereby hospitals should bring staff short-
age issues to the attention of their board, and if no internal staff can be found, submit a
staffing request to the appropriate MOH divisions, in this case the Directorate General of
Nursing Affairs and the Undersecretary for Health Affairs. National nurses should be
sought first, and if this fails to satisfy the demand, then the DG of Nursing Affairs sub-
mits advertisements in consultation with the concerned MOH authorities. Recruitment
agencies in nursing source countries like India and the Philippines respond to such adver-
tisements and liaise with employers (MOH, 2003, MOH Website). Although Oman and
the Philippines do not have a bilateral labour agreement, Oman uses licenced private
recruiters in the Philippines, a leading source supplying trained nurses to overseas mar-
kets, to fulfil staffing requirements (Pittman, 2016). Using licenced recruiters is sup-
posed to be a safeguard against recruiter exploitation, but in practice is no guarantee.
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 179
These recruiters are licenced through the Philippines Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA), which regulates recruitment, implements and develops pro-
grammes and policies linked to migrant worker recruitment, accredits foreign employ-
ers, documents overseas foreign workers, adjudicates recruitment conflicts, as well as
negotiates bilateral agreements. The Philippines ...
has a vast, transnational migration bureaucracy through which it facilitates out-migration
[through] four key functions: (i) authorization (by processing i.e. visas and passports of
migrants), (ii) predeparture skills training, (iii) marketing (advertising migrants to prospective
employers), and (iv) conducting `marketing missions' (bilateral negotiations with labour-
receiving countries). (Rodriguez and Schwenken, 2013: 382)
When the Philippines does development bilateral labour agreements, it is based on
extensive public­private agreements structured to provide support for migrant workers
while meeting the development needs of the source and destination country (Rivera
et al., 2013). Indeed, migration from the Philippines is emblematic of a labour export
model that is driven and orchestrated by what Rodriguez (2010) calls the `labour broker-
age state'. Various actors play their role in this migration process to create `ideal migrant
subjects' who embody the goals and objectives of migration as a development tool (pri-
marily through the remittance process). Workers from the Philippines are `desired'
employees in Oman because they are perceived as well educated, well spoken (good
English skills) and `clean'(Philippine Embassy official, 18 June 2015, author interview).
The state and private intermediaries play a role in generating these migrant subjectivities
during the migrant cycle, which includes `extraterritorial interventions in contractual
disputes'(Rodriguez and Schwenken, 2013, 381). Extending such rights normalizes emi-
gration with the promise of `some degree of protection' overseas (Rodriguez and
Schwenken, 2013: 381).
The Philippines government currently requires a minimum wage of 160 OMR
(US$415) for general employment. This is feasible because the minimum wage set in
Oman only applies to citizens. This stipulation also makes Philippine nationals more
expensive relative to other labour-rich countries, which seems to contribute to percep-
tions of value and therefore increase demand for Philippine workers. Healthcare workers
earn more, and nurses earn in the range of 500 and 600 OMR (US$1298­US$1558) in
public establishments. In private establishments, nurses often only earn 250 OMR
(US$649), but the embassy is pushing for this to be increased to 350­400 OMR
(US$909­US$1039), including free accommodation. Salary is thus an example of deter-
ritorialized labour market regulation in Oman that differentiates betweenAsian migrants.
The politics of nationality also plays a role in perceptions of job security, promotion
and employee relations. Language can at times perform a crucial role here. Language is
a tool that can be used by individuals to make conversations, and by extension knowl-
edge and learning opportunities, exclusive to a particular group. This can impact nation-
als and non-nationals in various ways. For instance, Omani nurses report feeling the need
to fight for patient care to be discussed in English so all parties could participate, not just
doctors and nurses from particular language groups. Conducting work-related matters in
a foreign language (such as that of the expatriate workers) excludes non-speakers from
180 Global Social Policy 18(2)
the opportunity to contribute or to learn. This simultaneously marginalizes nationals and
securitizes knowledge and jobs for certain expatriate groups. The transnational nature of
the labour market also creates vulnerabilities for migrants in terms of contract translation
issues. A few expatriate research participants report signing contracts or other documents
in Arabic, without understanding the contents. Media, government edicts and other
reports on labour market regulation released in Arabic also cause concern. These are
often poorly translated or misinterpreted in English press coverage, resulting in miscom-
munication, information asymmetries and escalated concern over job security or employ-
ment conditions and benefits. The language politics of these combined practices,
experiences and perceptions thus contribute (unintentionally or otherwise) to feelings of
exclusion and paranoia on both sides. Where Omani nurses worry about opportunities for
learning and improvement, expatriate nurses worry about job security. We therefore
understand labour market regulation as resulting from the interactional effect of labour
export and labour market segmentation effects at various scales.
Our survey results indicate that for expatriate workers there is a general sense of
unease and raw acknowledgement of the precariousness of their employment in Oman,
even as the process of migration is framed as one of national need for Oman and national
development for the Philippines. This precariousness is generated by the reality of lim-
ited rights (related to job insecurity and impermanence in country) and the perceived
sense of employer greed (searching for loopholes to pay less or limit benefits). This is
especially evident in responses to questions about labour nationalization and wage rates,
where 74% of those surveyed believe that Omanis receive higher wages for the same job.
Interestingly, Omani nurses interviewed believed all nurses were paid according to sen-
iority. This apparent lack of awareness about the conditions of employment between
coworkers contributes to a lack of workplace solidarity while enhancing status and ten-
ure insecurity for expatriates.
No respondent reported `poor'treatment by their employer. A majority of respondents
selected `good'or `very good', with a few selecting neutral as their response to questions
about this. While interviewees suggested nurses were `actually treated good', they did
comment that Western expats `had it better'. This speaks to the formal and informal ways
in which expatriates from OECD nations, especially `White' workers, receive better
treatment. This often starts with the visa regime and continues with salary levels framed
by nationality. Although visa rules apply equally in principle, certain regulatory mecha-
nisms and employment practices reinforce racialized perceptions and practices. Western
expats rarely submit to surveillance and control to the same degree that Asian migrants
are expected to--often refusing to surrender their passports to employers. Moreover, at
times there are quotas for certain nationalities or certain genders which may be intro-
duced nation-wide or on a sectoral basis. These are often rationalized as part of nationali-
zation drives, but such policies are symptomatic of gendered, raced and classed
configurations, regulating both gender and family structure. Similar patterns have also
been identified in Bahrain (Nagy, 2013).
Recent reports suggest that visas for expatriate women to Oman are being restricted
in certain professions. The Ministry of Manpower explains that female visa applications
are `treated on a case-by-case basis' with a view `to protect women and prevent abuse of
the system' (Anderson, 2016). Whether a workplace is appropriate or safe for women is
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 181
essentially left to the discretion of visa officers. Another restriction is linked to the
requirement of a minimum salary level (600 OMR/US$1558 as of early 2016) in order
for the family of the employee to be allowed to join (Times News Service, 2016). While
this especially targets unskilled labourers, it also impacts many skilled professions like
health workers who may not earn enough to receive a family visa for their spouse and
children.
Intermediaries also play a role in creating uncertainty with regard to salary, and this
has a clear gendered dimension, since 27% of the women surveyed indicated they were
paid lower salaries than promised compared to none of the male respondents. Nearly
twice as many women as men were made to sign a new contract after they arrived (20%
compared to 11%). Women also paid more in total costs to migrate than men, with 20%
of female respondents spending more than 500 Rials (nearly US$1300) compared to
none of the male respondents. While a much larger survey would be necessary to exam-
ine whether this gendered dimension persists across other migrant professions, global
evidence on the feminization of labour suggests that women are disproportionately
impacted by the casualization of the global labour force, receive worse contracts and are
routinely paid less than their male counterparts (Das, 2012).
Most survey respondents were attracted to work in Oman because of the better sala-
ries offered in comparison to the Philippines, their home country. The obligation to sup-
port families was part and parcel of the economic motivation for migrants. One respondent
noted,
Salary is way better here than in the Philippines, same work load and yet there is a very big
difference. At least here even if we are far away from our families our efforts are not wasted
because monetary wise we are being compensated (Survey response 2014).
Some were motivated to work in Oman because of the experience of working in a differ-
ent country or with different equipment. Approximately 17% of our survey respondents
indicated they were using Oman as part of a two-step migration process towards Canada
or other Western countries (also see Paul, 2011; Percot, 2006).
The tenuous conditions of employment for female expatriate workers will not neces-
sarily dampen the supply, and the Philippines labour export model and Oman's seg-
mented labour market arguably maintains supply through transnational interaction. For
example, while the confiscation of passports is no longer legal in Gulf countries, in
practice it continues to happen with the implicit consent of many Asian embassies. The
Philippine labour attaché claimed that passports should be in custody of the owner or the
Philippine government and stated that the Embassy tries to encourage employers to leave
passports with their employees. However, he also said that `he understands their con-
cerns'; employers do not want the risk of the employee leaving without warning. Our
respondents noted that employers often retain employee passports and do not relinquish
them for holiday or other travel without adequate justification. Passport confiscation is
deemed necessary in Oman because exit visas (and implicitly sponsor permission) are
not required to travel outside the country. Because of the dual requirement of passport
and resident card to exit the country, the Philippine embassy suggests employers leave at
least one document with the employee while holding on to the other. While playing the
182 Global Social Policy 18(2)
advocate in encouraging the relinquishment of passports, such unwritten policies on the
part of sending nations essentially sanction the restrictions on the movement of their
nationals and signal subservience in the bilateral state relationship that enhances the
vulnerability of expatriate workers of that nationality.
The immobility of labour within Oman is what seemed most concerning to our inter-
locutors. This immobility is formally regulated since there is a requirement to finish a
contract before moving to another employer, or face a 2-year visa ban. Movement to a
new employer under any circumstance requires a non-objection certificate from the
existing employer, suggesting further reinforcement of control over migrant labour
though the production of insecurity.
The vulnerabilities of the nursing labour market in highly internationalized healthcare
markets like Oman are heightened by the gendered nature of the occupation globally.
This reality intersects with the segmentation of the labour market between nationals and
non-nationals in the workplace and through the regulation and surveillance policies and
practices evident in the labour market. These multiple vulnerabilities exact a disciplinary
force on expatriate workers, which is supported through transnational factors of poor
employment conditions at home, the complicity of sending governments and the multi-
plex nature of employment in Oman's health sector. This underlines our findings that the
nursing labour market in Oman operates in a globalized policy space, with overlapping
levels of authority and deterritorialized regulation at play often in very mundane spaces
of state practice ­ an argument discussed further below.
National policy interaction and the generation of global social policy:
actors on the ground
Meetings with Philippine Embassy officials contributed to our conceptualization of mul-
tilayered governance in the health labour market and the construction of global social
policies. There are multiple components of this, including legal representation, setting
wage rates, assessing and providing contract language, reviewing and approving employ-
ers, promoting and facilitating further bilateral relations that might enhance migrant
worker opportunities, the provision of worker insurance and regional consultations with
other ASEAN sending nation representatives in Oman. Despite the fact that Oman has
only ratified four out of nine international labour conventions (Roper and Barria, 2014:
46), the Philippine Embassy uses such approaches to advance a policy of migrant worker
protection and compensation within the national Omani labour market system.
In terms of legal representation, the Philippine's Embassy in Oman is active in the
governance of its own nationals according to local laws. In addition to advocating for
Philippine nationals within Oman, including promoting the need to ease restrictions and
improve working and living conditions, they also represent Philippine nationals in
labour disputes. Sending states mediate in the legal system of the receiving nation and
in so doing become part of the labour complaints process. According to Embassy offi-
cials, when confronted with complaints they play an active role. First, they try to medi-
ate between employee and employer. If the parties will not meet, the Embassy calls the
placement agency. The Embassy allocates much of the responsibility for contracts and
placements, and by extension contract discrepancies and violations, on the shoulders of
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 183
the recruitment and placement agencies, which have been vetted and licenced by POEA.
If the parties refuse mediation by the Embassy, they are referred to the Omani Ministry
of Manpower's small court system. The labour attaché suggested there are clear rules
governing labour and the labour court is well equipped and ready to move quickly. In
these occurrences, the Embassy provides Arabic-speaking counsel for their nationals.
Indeed, this example reveals Stone's (2008: 19) argument that global public policy for-
mation includes `multiple and contested modes of authority'. Responsibility shifts
between employee and employer, sending and receiving governments, and intermediar-
ies like recruitment agencies.
The Philippines Embassy is involved in the extraterritorial governance of the nursing
labour market in Oman, enacted through setting minimum wage requirements; review-
ing accommodation, facilities and contracts; and monitoring Philippine companies
operating in Oman. The Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) (POLO Muscat) and
the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), both under the auspices of the
Embassy, are active in such matters in Oman. Employment contracts are also assessed
by the embassy. In fact, the Embassy provides a standard contract that is used for
employer and employee, which contains the same text and the same protections as the
contract provided by the Omani Ministry of Manpower. According to the labour attaché,
the contracts do not usually vary between the one the employee is given in the Philippines
and the one they ultimately sign. The problem emerges when private establishments or
recruitment intermediaries give new hires an offer letter with different provisions to
sign. Complaints are at times brought to the Embassy. In these cases, the Embassy
informs them that such contracts are not valid. Complaints are made in a variety of
ways, including in person, through text messaging and increasingly through social
media.According to the Embassy, the majority of complaints come from those employed
in private establishments and tend to be related to delayed salary, poor accommodation
and long hours. The segmentation of nursing labour markets differentiates regulation
into distinct public and private sector policy domains, leaving expatriates in the private
sector disadvantaged.
The provision of insurance is another dimension of worker protection policy that
reflects a transnational institutional interaction. Within Oman no company or sponsor
can hire a Filipino without an adequate insurance package. On the other end, employees
are insured and examined (full medical and psychological examination) in the Philippines
prior to being permitted to leave the country for work purposes. All recruitment agencies
require accreditation with the OWWA. In order to work or return to a job overseas,
Filipinos require an Overseas Employment Certificate. This can be obtained in Muscat
prior to going home on leave or at home.
Global social policy can also emerge from the interaction of a collection of sending
states, and this is occurring in terms of the negotiation and coordination of policies across
ASEAN member states. This is not only within the ASEAN region but also in Oman.
There is a committee comprising ASEAN members in Oman that meets on a monthly
basis to discuss items of mutual interest. Called the ASEAN Committee in Muscat
(ACM), the ambassadors meet on a monthly basis with a semi-annual rotation of the
committee chair (Philippine Embassy to Muscat Press Releases, 2015a, 2015b). Among
the issues that preoccupy them most, according to senior officials at the Embassy, are
184 Global Social Policy 18(2)
labour. The labour attaché regularly consults withASEAN members and views Indonesia
as the Philippine's most relevant ASEAN partner in Oman. In addition to regular meet-
ings, ASEAN members try to coordinate their positions and advocacy with regard to
expatriate labour issues in Oman. According to interviews, a group of labour attachés
approached the Ministry of Manpower together to discuss hiring, recruitment and other
procedures. Officials cited various ministries and institutions they approach, including
the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Higher Education, Royal
Oman Police, Supreme Council of Planning and some of the main employers including
the Sultan Qaboos University hospital.
The activism of sending states and the informal diplomatic interactions of ASEAN
states to secure favourable policy developments reveals a multiplex landscape of more
than national regulation and policy formation in the area of the healthcare labour market.
When combined with the particular nature of the healthcare system, the challenges of
advancing a national policy of Omanization in health care and the gendered complexities
associated with the status of nursing, we see how the development and operation of
health workforce policy in Oman can be characterized as a form of global social policy
emerging from a contingent multiplex process marked by asymmetrical contestation.
Conclusion
In this article, we have examined the convergence of policies that shape nursing labour
markets in the Sultanate of Oman during a period of policy transition from dependence on
an expatriate to an increasingly nationalized labour force. Our case study has advanced
theoretical arguments about the nature of complexity at work in global social policy and
the variable and interactional effects of multiple states and institutions operating in this
realm. We have explored global social policy in the making in a Gulf nation where labour
nationalization policies alongside the increased use of expatriate labour appear to be con-
tradictory, but are in fact complementary in reinforcing the wider context of insecurity
that is a central feature of migration to Gulf countries. In this case, we observe contradic-
tions and tensions that `emerge from an inherent incongruence between the logic of policy
and the structural logic of the economy' (Ennis, 2015: 138). We thus argue that the incor-
poration and status of migrant workers in overseas labour markets is produced through a
transnational interaction of the policies and discourses of sending and receiving states.
Examining a case of economic migration outside of the dominant Western south-to-north
migration context broadens scholarship on migration and global social policy formation
to include important migratory spaces which receive limited academic treatment.
Conversations about work, labour and migration still centre on bounded spaces and
identities, and territorial boundaries where the state is the central actor. Although states
ultimately enforce geographic boundaries and regulate modes of individual participation
in the labour market, the policies which guide and inform these are increasingly deterri-
torialized. Expat labour dependence, export labour policies and nationalization polices in
the GCC have come to interact in a manner that effectively creates a form of global social
policy. The governance of healthcare labour markets does not occur at a domestic level
alone, but includes multilayered forces above and across national contexts. The more we
Ennis and Walton-Roberts 185
analyse this process and such multiplex spaces the better positioned we are to advocate
for and advance fairer labour migration policies.
Structural features in the global economy and the supremacy of neoliberalism frame
and configure policy formation, where `goals are defined and pursued in which the state
(or government) is not necessarily the only or most important actor'(Betsill and Bulkeley,
2006: 244). This is clear in Oman where private sector employers continue to demand
expatriate workers, and in the case of the Philippines where the deployment of Overseas
Foreign Workers occurs through a capillary system of regulated private recruiters. The
interaction of states and markets in the global transmission of migrant workers contrib-
utes to a hybrid system where national policies can be constrained, undermined and
bypassed. New formations and processes emerge, which are the product of the transna-
tional effects of national policy making in both nations, in other fora such as ASEAN and
in wider regional groupings. Such pressures suggest the extraterritoriality of labour mar-
ket policies and hint towards governance and social policy formation beyond the state.
We elaborated on these arguments focusing on Oman's healthcare sector and the nursing
labour market, intersecting our analysis of conditions in Oman with an overview of poli-
cies in one of Oman's labour sending nations, the Philippines. The case of the nursing
sector in Oman demonstrates how labour market complexity is reflective of Stone's
(2008: 24) observation that policy practice is increasingly reflective of `a double devolu-
tion first, beyond the nation-state to global and regional domains and second, a delega-
tion of authority to private networks and nonstate actors'. Global social policy around
labour governance can thus form in a contingent fashion out of processes of deterritori-
alization and transnational market and regulatory forces.
Through examining the complexity of the Omani nursing labour market, we show that
labour market policy can be comprehended as a form of global social policy formation.
While sovereign decision making can theoretically dictate what happens within the bor-
ders of a single state, the reality of gendered labour market complexity and ongoing
worker export, as evident in nursing, effectively result in the production of forms of
global social policy. Understanding this reality offers a new perspective of the spheres of
influence and realms of authority involved in managing skilled labour markets and
migration under conditions of globalization and a more fulsome recognition of how
social policy and economic transformation occur and evolve.
