Abstract
Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), which is widely used to treat pain and urolithiasis, is a promising therapy for
urinary stone prevention. This study investigated the clinical efficacy of a popular CHM, Wu-Ling-San (WLS), in Taiwan for
the prophylaxis of recurrent nephrolithiasis as assessed by surgical stone treatment via a nationwide population-based cohort
study. The National Health Insurance Research Database, 2000­2010, which included one million patient records. All patients
diagnosed with stone disease at the beginning of the study. The matched controls (4-fold the number of WLS patients) were
stone patients who did not take WLS. Data analysis included the stone surgeries following the first treatment. We enrolled
11
900 patients with stone disease, and the incidence of stone patients in this database was 1.19%. The prevalence of
comorbidities such as benign prostate hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection, but
not hypertension, was significantly higher in WLS users. Several patients in both groups were prescribed potassium citrate.
The stone treatment rate was significantly higher in WLS users (17.85%) than in the non-WLS users (14.47%). WLS users
with an associated comorbidity had a higher treatment rate than the non-WLS users: 21.05% versus 16.70%, respectively.
The surgery rate for upper urinary tract stones was higher in WLS users than in the non-WLS users (adjusted hazard ratio,
1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.52; P < .05). The stone treatment rate (52.79%) was significantly higher in patients who
used a very high amount of WLS (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-3.98). Stone patients using a high
amount of WLS use had a high stone surgical rate. Long-term therapy with WLS did not have a preventive effect on stone
surgical treatment. Long-term potassium citrate therapy as a preventive measure appeared to be underutilized in this study.

Introduction
Many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) prac-
tices have emphasized health promotion; however, this has not
been the focus of the bulk of CAM research.1,2 CAM practitio-
ners could be seen as a public health resource to increase the
population's access to certain clinical preventive services.3-6
Urolithiasis is a common condition for which the prevalence
varies according to sex and age.7-9 In the US population, the
reported prevalence of a history of kidney stones is 10.6% in
men and 7.1% in women.10,11 The overall prevalence has
increased from 3.8% to 8.8% (in past three decades).10-12
Epidemiologically, urinary stone disease accounted for 9.6%
of the total population of Taiwan in 2001.13 Furthermore, this
condition accounted for a high proportion of medical visits,
with an overall age-adjusted prevalence of 7.35% (5.77% in
women and 8.97% in men) in 2010. Huang et al14 reported the

overall recurrence rate (a new episode within a 180-day inter-
val) at 1 and 5 years as 6.12% and 34.71%, respectively.
Uribarri et al15 reported a similar recurrence rate of 35% within
5 years. Therefore, medical treatments such as potassium
citrate are provided to prevent the recurrence of urinary
stones.16
Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is widely
accepted by Taiwanese and Chinese societies and
elsewhere.17 In a previous laboratory and clinical study, we
reported the effects of the Wu-Ling-San (WLS) formula on
the prevention of recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.
The WLS formula effectively inhibited the process of cal-
cium oxalate nucleation, crystallization, and aggregation in
vitro and in vivo. In a small short-term randomized control
trial, WLS increased urine output without serious adverse
effects in comparison with a control group.18-20 However,
long-term clinical experience with WLS use as a preventive
formula is lacking.21 The effectiveness of WLS should be
further confirmed in a large population in a long-term clini-
cal study. Recently, a nationwide population-based study that
enrolled a large population of patients was conducted in
Taiwan for stone disease, and this study enabled us to per-
form a survey to investigate the clinical usage of the WLS
formula to prevent recurrent stone as assessed by stone sur-
gery in Taiwan.14 By utilizing these nationwide data, we
were able to elucidate the clinical effect of the WLS formula
in the prevention of stone recurrence.
Methods
Database
Claimed data from the National Health Insurance Research
Database (NHIRD) were used in this study. The data were
obtained from the health care information of > 96% of all
medical claims in Taiwan since 1996. The medical services
provided by the NHI program included both Western and tra-
ditional medicine as well as outpatient care, inpatient care,
physical therapy, dental services, prescription drugs, medical
institution services, and registration files with scrambled
identifications.
Representative data between 2000 and 2010 were ran-
domly obtained from the claims dataset of a sample of 1 mil-
lion enrolled from the entire insured population in the NHI
program base (Database, LHID2000). The diagnosis codes
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were used in the
database. The NHIRD was previously described in detail.22
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
China Medical University (CMUH104-REC2-115), Taiwan.
Study Sample
For the study cohort, we selected patients newly diagnosed
with a urinary tract stone (ICD-9-CM codes 592 and 59993)
between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010. Patients
who were aged  20 years (n = 1391), received WLS before
the renal stone (n = 3046), had a history of malignancy (986,
ICD-9-CM 140-208), or had undergone surgery (n = 15158)
were excluded. In this case-control study, the case group
patients received WLS and the treatment date was defined as
the index date. In the control group, 4 controls each are fre-
quency matched with each individual case patient according to
age (every 5 years), gender, study-year, and index-year.
Finally, we identified a total of 11900 patients with stone dis-
ease. Patients who took WLS were further divided into low
(<5 g/y), medium (5-11 g/y), high (11-43 g/y), and very high
(44 g/y) users to compare the dose effect. Furthermore, we
evaluated comorbidities (might affect the incidence of urethral
stones) such as hypertension,23 benign prostate hyperplasia,24
gout, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, and dia-
betes mellitus25 as well as patients who took potassium citrate
as a preventive treatment in both groups.
Surgery following stone disease was defined as any sur-
gery for a stone 180 days after the first diagnosis of stone
disease. The surgery codes were 55.0, 56, 57, 58, and 98.51
(Table 1). Both study cohorts were followed up until the last
date in the database (the end of 2010). We searched the

database for stone treatment and calculated the total treat-
ments in each patient.
Statistical Analyses
Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in the
distribution of sociodemographic factors and comorbidities
between the cohorts with and without WLS use. Person-
years of follow-up duration were calculated for each indi-
vidual until the end of the database period. A Poisson
regression model was used to examine the incidence of fol-
lowing stone treatment, and the 95% confidence interval (CI)
of stone treatment with categorical variables was calculated
for each cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard mod-
els were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI
for factors associated with comorbidity such as age, gender,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), gout, chronic kidney
disease (CKD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and uri-
nary tract infection (UTI). All analyses were performed by
using the SAS statistical package (SAS System for Windows,
Version 9.4) with the statistical significance level set at .05.
Results
We identified 2382 patients who used WLS and 9518
patients for the non-WLS group. Therefore, the incidence
of stone patients in this database was 1.19%
(11900/1000000). The demographic analysis between
WLS users and the non-WLS users revealed no significant
difference in gender and age. The mean age was 49.1 years
in both groups. The WLS-user group comprised 1213 men
and 1169 women and the non-WLS users comprised 4846
men and 4672 women. The ratios of the following comor-
bidities were significantly higher in WLS users: benign
prostate hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mel-
litus, and urinary tract infection (P < .0001). Urinary tract
infection was the most common comorbidity in the WLS
group, occurring in 1031 patients. The comorbidity of
hypertension was not significantly different between the 2
groups (Table 2). Few stone patients were prescribed
potassium citrate in both groups. Although WLS users had
a higher ratio of potassium citrate use than the non-WLS
users, only 1.22% potassium citrate users were identified
in the population.
The incidence of stone treatments used in both groups
during the follow-up period is shown in Table 3. Overall,
the incidence of stone treatment was higher in WLS users
(17.85%) than in the non-WLS users (14.47%) during the
follow-up period (crude HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46; P <
.05). Men had a higher stone treatment rate than women,
regardless of grouping (585 vs 179 patients, respectively).
Stone surgery was higher in patients with a comorbidity
overall in both groups. The treatment rate in patients with
an associated comorbidity was higher in WLS users
(21.05%) than in the non-WLS users (16.70%) (adjusted
HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.52; P < .01). However, this dif-
ference was not significant after adjusting for several fac-
tors (age, gender, hypertension, DM, BPH, gout, CKD,
UTI, and potassium citrate user; HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-
1.52). A weak association of increasing stone treatment in
stone patients who used WLS was observed in the age dis-
tribution. Surgery for upper urinary tract stones was higher
in WLS users than in the non-WLS users (adjusted HR,
1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52; P < .05). In contrast, WLS users
had a lower incidence of operations when the stone was
located in the lower urinary tract (7.29 vs 13.53%, respec-
tively). However, the number of cases was limited to 474 in
WLS users (Table 4).
As shown in Table 5, patients in the very high WLS group
had a significantly higher stone treatment rate (52.79%;
adjusted HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.30-3.98; P < .0001).
Discussion
The comparison between WLS users and non-WLS users
revealed that long-term WLS use in stone patients did not
have a preventive effect on subsequent stone surgery in this
study. No difference was observed between WLS users and
the non-WLS users among stone patients without comor-
bidities. Increased stone treatment was observed in stone
patients who used WLS compared with non-users, but this
difference was not significant if the WLS user took less than
43 g of WLS per year. The stone treatment rate was notably
increased in very high WLS users regardless of the clinical

in this study.
Several comorbidities were found to be associated with
stone disease in this study. Patients with comorbidities such
as hypertension, gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, chronic
kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection
were enrolled. Overall, the ratio of stone patients with
comorbidities was significantly higher in WLS users (22.7%)
than in the non-WLS users. We propose that stone patients
with comorbidities may be more likely to seek further

treatment, or that these patients may have taken WLS for
other conditions in addition to stone disease. However, no
statistically significant difference in the rate of further stone
treatment was observed between the 2 groups without comor-
bidities. Therefore, WLS might not have a preventive effect
in patients without comorbidity.
The WLS formula is mainly used to treat uremia and
dropsy and to promote urination in traditional Chinese medi-
cine. According to the first recorded use of WLS "Shang Han
Lun" (Treatise of Cold-induced Disorders), written by
Zhong-Jing Zhang, WLS was commonly used for the treat-
ment of urinary tract disorders. Therefore, it is understand-
able that we found a high rate of this comorbidity in the
group of WLS users. Based on this information, we presume
that the original use of WLS was not for the treatment of
stone disease. The first recorded use of WLS to treat stone
disease was found in the book of "Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng"
(Standards of Patterns and Treatment), written by Ken-Tang
Wang in the Ming Dynasty (later 16th century). However, we
could not elucidate the number of WLS users who were pre-
scribed this agent for the treatment of stone disease in the
current database.
Recently, Siener et al26 investigated oxalate content in
herbal remedies and dietary supplements based on plant
extracts. Urinary oxalate excretion is directly related to the
amount of oral intake and intestinal absorption rate of oxa-
late. They evaluated the possibility of increasing oxalate
ingestion, which could lead to secondary hyperoxaluria,
associated with the intake of herbal remedies and dietary
supplements containing plant extracts. Their results showed
remarkable differences in oxalate contents of the extracts.
The selected herbal remedies and dietary supplements con-
taining plant extracts represent only a low risk for calcium
oxalate stone formers, if the recommended daily dose is not
exceeded.
Anumber of herbal extracts and remedies have been tested
in vitro or in preclinical in vivo models to assess their activity
as chemolytic agents, or as agents preventing new stone for-
mation. A number of clinical studies have also been per-
formed to investigate the efficacy of various herbal remedies
in the primary/secondary management of urolithiasis. More
recently, Monti et al analyzed the clinical evidence on the
efficacy of phytotherapy in the treatment of calculi in the uri-
nary tract. They found that citrate is more effective than phy-
totherapy in decreasing the size of existing calculi in the
urinary tract and in decreasing the urinary excretion rate of
uric acid.27 We previously conducted a pilot study on the use
of WLS for calcium oxalate stone prevention.20 The urine
amount was increased slightly in this study, which included a
small number of cases with short-term follow-up. However,
these results could not predict its long-term effect on stone
recurrence.
The incidence of stone patients in this case-control study
was 1.19%, which is very similar to the rate of 1.2% to 1.3%
reported in a previous population-based study by Huang
et al.14 Our value might have been lower than that of the pre-
vious study because of our exclusion criteria. We excluded
patients who were less than 20 years of age, who had previ-
ously used WLS, and who had a malignancy, whereas Huang
et al did not exclude any comorbidity. Therefore, this may
explain the differences in the incidence between these 2
studies.
Potassium citrate has a well-known and documented role
as a major preventive drug.28-30 In a retrospective cohort study
of long-term potassium citrate use in stone patients by
Robinson et al,30 the stone formation rate was significantly
(93%) decreased after the initiation of potassium citrate ther-
apy. Potassium citrate may produce a short-term high citratu-
ric state and a long-term change in urinary metabolic
profiles.31,32 These authors confirmed that potassium citrate
therapy for as long as 14 years was useful in patients with
recurrent nephrolithiasis. However, few patients took potas-
sium citrate as a preventive measure against stone recurrence
in both groups in this study. In addition, the finding of
increased medical demands in the analysis of Huang et al14
indicated that stone recurrence was increased in their ana-
lyzed patients. Therefore, medical treatments for stone recur-
rence were not decreased in their report. The long-term use of
oral drugs is inconvenient for patients and carries the risk of
potential side effects. Therefore, recurrence of stone disease

is likely in these patients, necessitating treatment and result-
ing in increased medical costs.33-35 We could not determine
the benefit of potassium citrate in this study because of the
small numbers of patients and prescriptions for this therapy.
This study had several limitations. First, the information
regarding risk factors for recurrence was not clear for the
patients in this study. The recurrence rate may be higher for
patients with risks factors such as metabolic disorders, posi-
tive family history, or hyperuricosuria and hypercalcemia.36,37
Therefore, patients with a higher recurrent rate may have a
stronger desire to seek preventive treatment than would
patients with a lower recurrent rate. Second, we studied the
code only for invasive treatment of stone patients as a sur-
rogate for stone recurrence. Third, our results disagree with
previous in vitro and in vivo studies for WLS. The explana-
tions for these differences include the use of different spe-
cies in various studies, the difference between the
well-controlled atmosphere of the laboratory versus a pop-
ulation-based study, the fact that this was a short-term trial
that excluded other systemic disorders, the fact that nation-
wide data are obtained from various doctors ranging from
medical centers to local clinics, and the fact that patients
may have been treated with WLS for other chronic illness
such as chronic kidney disease and lower urinary tract
symptoms rather than for stones. Fourth, we were not able
to assess whether the long-term use of WLS has a preven-
tive effect on stone recurrence because we had a small num-
ber of cases and this was a short-term randomized control
trial. Finally, the stone expulsion effect of WLS was not
considered in this study.
Conclusions
In traditional CHM, the WLS formula is widely used to treat
several disorders such as stone disease, hypertension, gout,
chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, and diabetes
mellitus. The stone surgical rate was high in stone patients
who used a high amount of WLS. No statistical difference
was observed between WLS users and the non-WLS users in
stone patients without comorbidities. Nevertheless, long-
term therapy with WLS did not have a preventive effect on
the stone surgical treatment in stone patients. A large-scale
clinical study of WLS is warranted to elucidate the con-
