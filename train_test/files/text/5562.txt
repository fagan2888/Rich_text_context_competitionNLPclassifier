Abstract
This article elaborates on the results of a field experiment conducted among speakers of the
Chakali language, spoken in northern Ghana. In the original study, the Color-aid Corporation
Chart was used to perform the focal task in which consultants were asked to point at a single
colour tile on the chart. However, data from the focal task could not be analysed since the Color-
aid tiles had not yet been converted into numerical values set forth by the Commission
internationale de l'e
´clairage (CIE). In this study, the full set of 314 Color-aid tiles were
measured for chromaticity and converted into the CIE values at the Daylight Laboratory of the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology. This article presents the conversion
methodology and makes the results of the measurements, which are available in the Online
Appendix. We argue that some visual-perception terms cannot be reliably ascribed to colour
categories established by the Color-aid Corporation. This suggests that the ideophonic
expressions in the dataset do not denote `colours', as categorised in the Color-aid system, as it
was impossible to average the consultants' data into a CIE chromaticity diagram, illustrate the
phenomena on the Natural Colour System (NCS) Circle and Triangle diagrams, and conduct a
statistical analysis. One of the implications of this study is that a line between a visual-perception

Introduction
In studies on colour categorisation, the focal task (i.e., the exemplary task) is an experiment
that aims at gathering the best examples for an array of colours and calculating the loci of the
elicited terms. When a claim is made that a certain language has N colour terms, the focal
task examines the behaviours of a representative sample of native speakers in identifying the
regions in which each of the colour terms are clustered. The results may clarify central and
unusual properties of colour-term denotations. On one hand, the focal task can (dis)prove the
hypothesis claiming that colour expressions are universally based on `favoured precepts
selected from restricted regions of the colour space' (Regier, Kay, & Cook, 2005). In such
studies, the most common colour array is the Munsell colour system (Munsell, 1912). On the
other hand, from a lexico-semantic perspective, experiments testing focal colour distribution
can assist studies on expressions that have a diffuse set of colour denotations and provide
evidence for purported `colour' terms that have almost no central concentrations in a colour
array, allowing for reflective assessments of the structuring of sensory meanings and the
cultural component through which objects obtain their symbolic meanings (Barthes, 1967).
This study builds on the previously published dataset by Brindle (2016), which is presented
in more detail in the section titled `Colour categorisation in Chakali'. This original study left
one important question open: Do all purported `colour' terms have a central concentration in
a colour array? We aim to address this question by developing a mapping methodology while
keeping in mind two distinct challenges in colour studies: the first being a practical and
methodological one related to consistency in mapping different colour systems and the
other being an ontological one regarding the status of ideophones as colour terms.
The main objectives of this study are to develop a method that brings together all the
colour notations and to use the Commission internationale de l'e
´ clairage (CIE) numerical
values for the tiles in the Color-aid Corporation Chart to systematically (dis)qualify
ideophonic expressions as colour terms.
Colour Mapping Between Colour Systems
While the Munsell colour system has been widely used across disciplines such as
anthropology, psychology and linguistics, various studies used the Ostwald colour system
instead (Ostwald, Ostwald, & Streller, 1939); the most representative of these are a series of
descriptive studies regarding the linguistic influences on colour and categorical perceptions
carried out at the University of Surrey (i.e., Hippisley, Davies, & Corbett, 2008; I. Davies &
Corbett, 1994; I. R. L. Davies & Corbett, 1995; I. Davies, Corbett, & Margalef, 1995; I.
Davies, Jover, Vega, & Ponte, 2001; I. R. L. Davies et al., 1992). The languages studied by
Surrey groups are Russian, English, Sorbian, Tsakhur, Setswana, Catalan, and Damara. The
Ostwald colour system was implemented by the Color-aid Corporation in the ordered set of
2 i-Perception
colour tiles in which the main features of colour are defined as hue, tint, and shade (Color-
Aid-Corporation, Revised 2006). In addition, the series of studies at the University of Surrey
identified the loci of the colour terms (from several languages throughout the world) within
the CIE chromaticity diagram and converted some of the Color-aid codes (i.e., the tile ID
numbers) into the CIE coordinates; however, the data were limited to 65 preselected tiles.1
Until now, no CIE conversion has ever been offered for the complete range of 314 colours
in the Color-aid Corporation Chart. In addition, colour measurements presented in previous
studies are not complete or, at least, were not presented as such. Photometrical data collected
from all 314 Color-aid tiles under stable laboratory condition and made accessible to the
research community would be a valuable contribution to the literature and to researchers of
various scientific disciplines. In addition to the CIE (u0, v0) chromaticity graph, a graphical
presentation of the Natural Colour System (NCS) was used to represent the results in a way
that would be easier to interpret.
Ontological Challenge
While the primary goal of a focal task is to identify the region in which a colour term is most
appropriately located, another of its more rarely mentioned goals is to shed light on `secondary'
terms (i.e., those that are relatively less frequent and lack agreement among consultants as to
what they denote). In this regard, the result of focal task may clarify the unusual properties of
colour-term denotations, thereby providing an explanation for how a purported `colour' term
has almost no central concentrations in a colour array. For example, could this issue be a
consequence of the a priori categorisation in the colour array presented to the consultants?
To delve deeper into this line of research, this article reports and analyses data from a field
experiment conducted among native speakers of Chakali, a South-western Grusi language
spoken in northern Ghana. The primary objective is to attempt to devise how to study
expressions that, at first, appear to describe colours but are not yet assigned to any
specific region in a colour array; in other words, this article explores how to draw a line
between a visual-perception term and a colour term. To address this objective, we used a
statistical analysis method to identify the dissimilarities between the terms assigned by the
consultants to each colour category, the results of which are shown in the section titled
`Statistical analysis'.
Colour Categorisation in Chakali
This article makes use of data from Brindle (2016), who analysed colour categorisation in
Chakali in an attempt to identify its colour terms and other expressions of visual perception.
Brindle used a tile-naming task, a focal task and a folk-definition task, describing how native
speakers (language) make use of colour terms in a folk categorization. These experiments
were carried out in March 2008 and April 2013. The findings suggest that the language has at
least three terms corresponding largely to white, black and red, as well as a few other terms in
a `statistical transitional' stage (Brindle, 2016).
Results from the tile-naming task included a series of expressions from which basic
grouping, based on dominance and specificity, was determined.2 The triad of `white',
`black' and `red' achieved the highest consensus among the consultants, followed by terms
corresponding to `yellow' and `blue-green' (grue). The ideophonic expression hwlahwla (and
its variant: hwhwla) had a relatively high frequency, similar to the latter two colour terms, yet
no significant consensus could be detected as to which colour region this term denotes.
After analysing the results of the tile-naming task, many questions were raised; one was
Arbab et al. 3
related to the need to account for hwlahwla, that is: What status is to be given to a relatively
frequent term lacking dominance? Another question encompassed the larger domain of
inquiry, one related to the meanings of various ideophonic terms that are infrequent and
lacking dominance for the most part, yet employed by most of the consultants.
To answer these questions, we must first decipher the nature of these ideophonic
expressions. Due to the extensive research conducted within the last decade,3 ideophones
are better known and are more reliably defined. According to Dingemanse (2012),
ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery and are connected to
extralinguistic concepts: they can evoke sounds, taste, visual effects, texture, smell and so
on; they often have a reduplicative structure; they are often form a separate grammatical
category; and they are mainly found in Asian, African and Amerindian languages.
Ideophones subsumes onomatopoeic expressions since the latter phonetically imitate the
source of the sounds they describe. More generally, ideophones evoke a vivid impression
of an idea.4 It comes as no surprise, therefore, that ideophones emerged in an experiment on
expressions describing the visual appearance domain; however, it appears that ideophones
have a different meaning than the one ascribed by Dingemanse, at least regarding the
association between a colour region and a term.
Since the measure of dominance within the tile-naming task is intimately related to the
consultants' general concord on a colour term and its corresponding region, the focal task
was considered an appropriate follow-up experiment. This experiment is designed to
reveal the exemplary colour space for a set of expressions; that is, the focal task
determines how the consultants treat expressions denoted by a diffuse set of tiles in the
tile-naming task, thus determining whether all purported `colour' terms have a central
concentration in a colour array.
Through the focal task, Brindle (2016) aimed at gathering the best examples in an
array of colours. Data were collected using a relatively simple, inexpensive and
replicable method consisting of laying out the Color-aid Charts on a one-meter-high table.
Twenty-three adult consultants (10 men and 13 women, with the age ranging from 30 to
70 years with an average age of 45 years) stood by the table and viewed the array, displayed in
Figure 1.
The experiment took place outside, under the shade of thatched roofs, between 10:00 and
14:00 over two successive, sunny days. A typical session lasted 15 minutes and all sessions
were recorded and transcribed onsite. The consultants were asked, one-by-one, the question
in the following diagram (Q), which was uttered by a field assistant who is a native speaker of
Chakali. In each session, the colour word in the question was replaced by every stimulus
expression listed in Table 2 in either alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, which was
chosen at random.

`Of all these things, which one is really asIama?'
Using a short baton, the consultants were instructed to point at a single colour tile that they
believed best fit the given term. The experiment did not check the range of each term, only the
best example for all colour terms presented. While no tests for colour vision were carried out,
typical results of red­green colour blindness do not take part in the match.
The 314 colour tiles measured 0.5 Â 0.8 inches each and were distributed over four charts
(81/2 Â 11 inches each; Color-aid Corporation, 1989­2003). The `Extra Hues' section of
Chart 1 was deliberately covered as it contained 10 tiles (i.e., R, Y, B, G, YO, Yc, Gw,
BG, Rc and RO) at their highest point of saturation, which may have affected the
consultants' point of gaze and attracted too much of their attention; thus, the four charts
4 i-Perception
contained a total of 304 colour tiles. The goal was to encourage the consultants to visually
search through all four charts until they identified the best example.
Based on the results from the tile-naming task, the following groups were isolated for the
focal task: (a) dominant, (b) name-an-object (i.e., the name of an object that is characteristically
of the corresponding colour; see Berlin & Kay, 1969; e.g., s

Colour-Mapping Method and Representation
A new method was introduced to determine the CIE values for the full set of 314 Color-aid
tiles using photometrical measurements. One of the goals of colour science is to specify the
quality of colour using certain colour spaces. Some colour spaces separate the three
dimensions of colour into one luminance dimension and two chromaticity dimensions
while also maintaining perceptual uniformity (e.g., the CIELAB model). Within a colour

space, which is considered perceptually uniform, a unit change in colour value should
produce a similar change in visual importance, independent from the location.
Colour values can be transformed into a graphical diagram, known as the CIE (x, y)
chromaticity diagram, which provides a two-dimensional representation. However, this
diagram does not have a direct perceptual correlation; hence, many different chromaticity
diagrams have been proposed by squeezing or stretching the CIE (x, y) chromaticity diagram
so that it better represents the correlations between perceived colour differences and the
corresponding distances in the diagram. The x and y variables were transformed into a
new set of values (u, v) through a set of mathematical formulas (DeCusatis, 1997).
In 1976, the CIE standardised the (u0, v0) diagram as an approximately uniform
chromaticity diagram. This was achieved by multiplying the values for v by 1.5; thus, in
the new diagram, u0 ¼ u and v0 ¼ 1.5v.
The values of u0 and v0, as well as other photometrical values, in the whole Color-aid set
were measured under an artificial sky, which simulates overcast (i.e., creates even and diffused
illumination; see B. Matusiak & Arnesen, 2005; B. S. Matusiak & Braczkowski, 2014;
Figure 2), at the Daylight Laboratory of the Department of Architecture and Technology,
Light & Colour Centre, NTNU. The ceiling of the artificial sky room is covered in RGBW
LED-chips, which can generate light with different correlated-colour-temperature (CCT)
values.
In this study, a CCT of 6,500K was used. To provide stable and comfortable illumination,
the illuminance level under the artificial sky was adjusted to 50% of the maximum power,
imparting an illuminance of around 8,610 lux onto the Color-aid tiles. The tiles were
successively placed on a table located in the middle of the artificial sky room. The
photometrical measurements were taken using the SpectraScan PR-655 tool
(PhotoResearch) to determine the CIE coordinates for all 314 colour tiles. Each tile had a
matte finish and measured 2 Â 3 inches.
As indicated earlier, the CIE system is not easily interpreted. Since the NCS provides a
graphical representation of colours that is more easily understood, both by professionals and
laypeople, we decided to use the NCS to represent the results of this study, in addition to the
CIE (u0, v0) diagram. The NCS uses a numeric code that describes both the hue and nuance of
each colour (Ha
° rd & Sivik, 1981). For example, S1050-Y90R describes a colour that includes
yellow with 90% perceived red in hue, with a nuance of 10% blackness and 50% chromaticness
(Figure 3). We used the NCS Colour Scan tool to find the NCS code corresponding to each

Color-aid tile, finding that some of the Color-aid tiles may share the same hue but have
different nuances, and vice versa. The NCS codes are presented in Table 2.
Results
The result of the focal task in Brindle (2016) indicates that a wide range of colour tiles were
assigned to each ideophonic expression, which suggests that the selected ideophonic
expressions cannot be reliably ascribed to a recognisable colour region. Converting the 314
Color-aid tiles into the CIE numerical values allowed us the opportunity to diagnose
Brindle's data and answer the questions raised. This section proposes how one can
approach situations in which ideophones cannot be said to denote `colours', as categorised
by the Color-aid Corporation.
In Table 2, the Chakali expressions, the Color-aid tile code, the number of consultants
who pointed at each tile, the NCS code, the x-value, the y-value, the u0-value, the v0-value
and the luminance (cd/m2) are aligned from left to right. It can be observed that the terms
p
Gmma´, bu´mmo` and s`
Ia`ma´ are, respectively, clustered around the whitish-light, blackish-
dark, and reddish tiles. The name-an-object terms are predominantly associated with
specific regions: s
Gsa´
G `dawadawa flour' with the yellowish and orangish tiles, and
s
G 
ws
"n
I
I `bean-leaf water/broth' with the greenish tiles. The English loanword, bu`lu´u`,
clearly indicates a `grue' category, as the consultants mainly identified bluish and
greenish tiles as best fits for the term. Only two unusual responses produced results in
the yellow-brownish (YO-S1) and soft red-beige (RO-T2) areas. For the ideophones, the
consultants identified tiles that are distributed across the charts and, therefore, cannot be
reliably ascribed to a familiar colour space or category.
The lists of tile codes in Table 2 show that all ideophones can be represented with warm
and cool hues. Some could be delineated with negative statements; for example, RileRile was
assigned to 22 tiles without redness (R). Regardless, we argue that there are no defining
properties among the ideophones; thus, the only generalisation that can be made is that no
colour categorisation emerged in this category. There were almost as many tiles identified for
each ideophone as there were consultants, leading us to believe that these ideophones may
not have foci in the Ostwald or other colour systems, with perhaps one exception: h

The results will be presented graphically via the NCS Colour Circle (hue), the NCS Colour
Triangle (nuance) and the 1976 CIE (u0, v0) chromaticity diagram. To simplify the
presentation, the graphics in Figure 4 were used. One example from each category was
presented via the NCS circle and triangle diagrams, as shown in Figures 5 to 8. The CIE
(u0, v0) chromaticity and spectral power distributions were measured for all colour terms and
are available from the authors upon request.
Based on results presented in Table 2 and Figures 5 to 8, we can conclude the following:
(1) The term bu´mmo`, as presented in Figure 5, may be an appropriate expression for `dark-
grey' or `near-black' since most of the consultants (20 out of 23) selected a grey tile with
85% blackness.
(2) The term s
Gsa´
G, as presented in Figure 6, may be an appropriate expression for a
yellowish colour, but with a wide range of yellow hues with different nuances. Most of
the nuances have the same level of blackness, which is 5%.
(3) The term bu
`lu´u`, as presented in Figure 7, may describe a bluish colour but one that is
unclear in hue and nuances.
(4) The term h
wla`h
wla
`, as presented in Figure 8, does not refer to any specific colour as the
assigned tiles are distributed across the NCS Colour Circle. The nuances are also very
different and do not have a clear pattern. We can propose that the selected colours are
more pale (have more whitish).

Statistical Analysis
A statistical analysis was also carried out. To calculate the similarities between tiles selected
by the consultants based on their perceptions of the colour terms, the data were split into two
categories: hue and degree of blackness.
Figure 9 displays the mean degree of blackness among the selected colour tiles for
the studied colour terms with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The 95% CI represents
the degree of certainty for the mean degree of blackness, which, in turn, depends on the
standard deviation. The 95% CI also represents the degree of agreement among the
consultants: the smaller the CI, the greater the degree of agreement. The strongest
agreement on the degree of blackness can be found in the colours selected for s`
Ia`ma´ and
p
Gmma´, while the strongest disagreement can be found in the colours selected for Ri`le`Ri`le` and
dNu`mo
`dNu`mo
`.
For the hues, figuring out the degree of similarity is not as straightforward. We selected the
NCS Colour System to achieve this, since the hues are arranged in a circle and distances
between the different hues can be calculated using the degrees of the circle. We thus translated
every hue of the colour circle into a degree, with 9 marking the distance between two
neighbouring hues. Then, for each pair of colour tiles selected (i.e., answers given by two
consultants) for the same colour term, the shortest distance in the circle was calculated in
degrees. The distances were then averaged across all possible pairs to indicate the average

disagreement. For bu´mmo` and p
Gmma´, no mean distance in hue could be calculated because
most consultants chose a tile that did not include hue, only different degrees of blackness.
To test if these calculations are significantly different from those resulting from a random
draw of the colour tiles, we ran 50 simulations in which 23 colour tiles were randomly drawn
from the total array of 304 tiles with replacement. We then calculated the average degree of
the mean blackness among the 50 samples (represented by the dotted line in Figure 9) as well
as the mean of the 95% CIs (represented by the grey box in Figure 9). The four leftmost
colour terms in Figure 9 were assigned colour tiles with a significantly lower degree of
blackness than those randomly drawn from the full array (i.e., the CI for these four terms
do not overlap with the randomly drawn 95% CIs), and only bu´mmo` has a significantly
higher degree of blackness.
Figure 10 displays the mean distance in degrees on the NCS Colour Circle between the
selected colour tiles for each term, along with their 95% CIs. To test if these calculations are
significantly different from those resulting from a random draw of the colour tiles, we ran 50
simulations in which 23 colour tiles were randomly drawn from the total array of 304 tiles
with replacement. We then calculated the average distances between the colour tiles in all 50
samples (represented by the dotted line in Figure 10) as well as the mean 95% CIs
(represented by the grey box in Figure 10). The colour tiles selected for the three leftmost
colour terms have significantly lower distance than those randomly drawn from the colour
samples (i.e., the CIs for these three terms do not overlap with the randomly drawn 95%
CIs), which means that there is a significantly greater degree of agreement among the

Discussion and Conclusion
This article presented the photometrical measurements (colour coordinates) for 314
Color-aid tiles made in the Daylight Laboratory at the NTNU. The developed method
offers value beyond this study and every researcher is permitted to use the dataset, which
is provided in Online Appendix. The article began by presenting the original measurements of
all the tiles in the Color-aid Corporation Chart, then narrowing down the discussion to the
focal task experiment.
In the focal task, the goal was to understand the meaning of Chakali colour terms in terms
of established colour systems. The results were obtained with the help of the Color-aid
system, the NCS Colour Circle, the NCS Colour Triangle and the 1976 CIE (u0, v0)
chromaticity diagram. The CIE coordinates and the NCS codes were calculated using
the SpectraScan and NCS colour scanner tools, respectively. The range of tiles selected for
each colour term was analysed in terms of their u0 and v0 values (CIE) and their hues and
nuances (NCS).
Several studies have demonstrated that speakers of different languages may segment the
colour spectrum differently and that some nonchromatic properties may serve as variables to
determine colour categories (Biggam, 2012; Levinson, 2000; MacLaury, 2007). For example,
Conklin's (1955) study on Hanunoo colour terms showed that the variable of wetness or
dryness could override hue when establishing the appropriate colour term.
Based on the visual inspections, the data of this study suggest that the best example could
not be found for some terms, as the degree of variation is too significant to identify a
particular region of the colour space. On the face of it, there is no consensus and an
intermediate range is not easily conceived.
Before eliminating the chromatic properties and testing for various determinants, the
measurements of the tiles were converted into CIE coordinates to expose emerging clusters
that could be deduced from their chromatic properties, such as light/pale versus dark, or
warm versus cool.
If it turns out to be impossible to map the colour terms onto the Color-aid Chart, the
remaining questions are: What may account for that impossibility and how could we test it?
This article concludes with some remarks on the potential applications for the
measurements and the colour perception vocabulary of Chakali. We found that most of
the Chakali terms were not clear enough for the consultants to select or label them with
the related colour tiles, which suggests that naming and linguistic categorisations may affect
recognition. However, the findings were particularly interesting for the ideophone h
wla`h
wla`,
which might have some characteristics of colour. This term is highly frequent, but the
consultants could not agree on where the colour should be mapped. Regarding hue, the
consultants' answers spread across the NCS Colour Circle, while their answers on the
NCS Colour Triangle are found rather close to pure white and can therefore be
interpreted as having whitish nuances.
The statistical analysis revealed that among the colours selected for h
wla
`h
wla` or h
wh
wla`,
similar to other ideophones included in this study, the mean distance between any two hues
(dissimilarity) was about 90 (i.e., 90 on the NCS Colour Circle), which is also the distance
between two consecutive primary colours (e.g., pure yellow and pure red, pure red and pure
blue, etc.). In addition, contrary to other ideophones, h
wla
`h
wla` or h
wh
wla
` refers to a colour
Arbab et al. 17
with a very low degree of blackness (i.e., between 5% and 20%, with a mean degree of
blackness of about 12%). For the rest of the ideophones, it was not easy to predict which
colour they referred to.
The primary meaning of the remaining ideophones must be further investigated. In this
study, we tried to categorise them but did not achieve with any convincing results. Therefore,
we posit that these ideophones do not represent colours, but they may be connected to visual
perception in some manner.
We propose that the developed method, consisting of the CIE and NCS systems and
supplemented by a novel approach to statistical analysis, could be a very useful tool for
gaining a better understanding of how precise different languages are in terms of colour
naming, even when there are no equivocal colour terms in English. This method enables a
precise, numerical estimate of the dissimilarity between the colours selected, both in terms of
blackness and hue.
