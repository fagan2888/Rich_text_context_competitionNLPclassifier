The objective of this article is to improve our
understanding of preferences in experienced-based
choice. Positioned within the framework of naturalistic
decision making,this article responds to the recent call to
complement the examination of experience-based choice
with studies of cognition in the "wild." We document
an exploratory field study that uses applied cognitive
task analysis (ACTA) to examine financial day traders'
preferences. Providing real-world examples, our study
illustrates how day traders construct their understanding
of gains relative to losses and emphasizes the relevance
of prospect theory for understanding the asymmetry
of human choice.The fourfold pattern of preferences as
studied in the wild is risk seeking for medium- and high-
probability gains, risk averse for small-probability gains,
risk averse for small-probability losses, and risk averse for
medium- and high-probability losses. Our results differ
from the fourfold pattern of preferences exhibited by
experience-based choice when studied in the laboratory.
The implications of this work for prospect theory and
the distinction between "experience through learning"
and "experience through professional training" are
discussed alongside the merits of theACTA technique for
professional expert domain-based knowledge elicitation.

Introduction
Modern decision science is undergoing a pro-
cess of reframing. Although decision research was
once split by distinct preferences for what it ought
to be, recognition of the need for a more unified
and complete understanding of decision making
has called for an end to these divisions (Dalal et al.,
2010; Gore, Banks, Millward, & Kyriakidou,
2006; Hertwig & Erev, 2009; Kahneman & Klein,
2009; McAndrew, Banks & Gore, 2008; McAn-
drew, Gore & Banks, 2009). Examples of what
some have claimed decision making ought to be
include a discipline based on normative ideals and
prescriptive standards, one providing descriptive
accounts of cognition studied in the "wild," and
the study of systematic deviations in the form of
heuristics and biases. Recent reframing by Kahne-
man and Klein (2009) has focused on the intersec-
tions between naturalistic decision making (NDM)
and the heuristics and biases approach. Parallel to
this discussion, Rakow and Newell (2010) recom-
mend the importance of researching a new frame
of experience-based choice within the wider con-
text of decision research. It is clear to appreciate
that the conditions for advancement are ripe.
This article draws insights from the field of
NDM to better understand decision makers'
preferences as investigated within the paradigm
of experience-based choice. We open with an
examination of recent findings relating to expe-
rience-based choice. Noting the call to comple-
ment this with studies of "cognition in the
wild," the authors highlight the important con-
tributions of the NDM community. We then
outline an exploratory field study that advances
our understanding of preferences in experience-
based choice in the wild. We conclude by con-
sidering the implications of our findings for
future research within the decision sciences.
Experience-Based Choice
Experience-based choice has rapidly become
a feature of decision science research. Recent
research has found decision makers' prefer-
ences to consistently differ depending on the
format of choice presented. This has been
marked by studies documenting the observation

Understanding Preferences in Experience-Based
Choice: A Study of Cognition in the "Wild"

of systematic differences between decisions
based on description and those based on experi-
ence (Camilleri & Newell, 2009b; Hertwig &
Erev, 2009; Newell & Rakow, 2007; Rakow &
Newell, 2010).
The first, decision from description, is a for-
mat whereby every possible outcome and deci-
sion is specified at the outset (Hertwig & Ples-
kac, 2008). Consider, for example, a game
whereby you are asked to choose between (a) a
90% chance of winning $0 and a 10% chance of
winning $10 or (b) a guaranteed $1. People tend
to attribute more weight to small-probability
events than objectively warranted and so prefer
(a), the gamble. That is, people are risk seeking
for small-probability gains and high-probability
losses (people tend to prefer a 10% chance of
$10 to $1 for sure) and risk averse for high-
probability gains and small-probability losses
(most people prefer $9 for sure to a 99% chance
of $10). Decisions emerge consistent with pros-
pect theory's fourfold pattern of choice: Partici-
pants are risk averse for high-probability gains,
risk seeking for high-probability losses, risk
averse for small-probability losses, and risk
seeking for small-probability gains (see Table 1).
The second format of choice, decision from
experience, is defined as one whereby personal
observation and feedback from the environment
guide the outcomes generated and assessments
of their relative probabilities. When people are
presented with the task in this format, prefer-
ences for small-probability gains and losses tend
to be the converse, with people displaying a
preference for the sure thing (b) (Barron & Erev,
2003; Erev et al., 2009; Hau, Pleskac, &
Hertwig, 2009; Hau, Pleskac, Kiefer, & Hertwig,
2008; Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004;
see Table 1). Risk aversion for a gain is attribut-
able to underweighting of the rare event. Exami-
nation of preferences for high-probability gains
and losses for decisions from experience has
been more limited, although speculation has sug-
gested that there is little difference when com-
pared to preferences in the condition of descrip-
tion (Rakow & Newell, 2010).
Explanations for the differences between
these formats of choice have included sampling
bias (one is more likely to undersample than
oversample experiences of rare events), recency
effects (giving more weight to observations
experienced most recently; although note Bar-
ron and Yechiam's [2009] findings that call into
question the notion of recency effects with rare
events), and the phenomenon of representation
(an encoding distortion of the outcome distribu-
tion prior to choice; Camilleri & Newell, 2009b;
Hertwig & Erev, 2009). Commenting on these
findings, Hertwig and Erev (2009) note the
results are to be viewed not as contradictory but
as an illustration of how the mind operates in
two different informational environments:
In other words, one should not play off
research on description-based and experi-
ence-based behavior--their contrast is
enlightening. However, to better under-
stand how people make decisions with
incomplete and uncertain information "in
the wild", there is a need to study experi-
ential choices that are often representative
of people's actual choices. (p. 522)

Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 181
Rakow and Newell (2010) echo this call for a
framework that places experience-based choice
within the wider context of decision research,
suggesting that rather than asking what happens
in experience-based choice and what happens in
described choice, one may do better to ask what
is the role of experience and what part does the
description play? They suggest this approach is
imperative to understanding properties of the
external choice environment, types of learning
experience, types of choice, and properties of
the internal representation of payoffs (see
Rakow & Newell, 2010, for a comprehensive
review of future directions). It is through such
an examination that we position this article in
the hope that this exchange is constructive to
both communities and researchers working in
the field and the laboratory.
Cognition in the Wild
Originating as a critique of disembodied
views of cognition resulting from study within
the artificial setting of the laboratory, the con-
cept "cognition in the wild" was coined by
Hutchins (1995a). By locating cognition in
context and by focusing on the interactions
between multiple agents and material artifacts,
the study of cognition in the wild would give
rise to the situated and socially constituted
aspects of cognitive activity.
A new perspective for cognitive science
guided by anthropology and cognitive theory,
decision making has been studied in complex
settings, such a shipboard navigation (Hutchins,
1995a), aviation (Hutchins, 1995b, 2000;
Hutchins & Klausen, 2000) and steam plant
operations (Halff, Hollan, & Hutchins, 1986).
Although the central thesis of Hutchins' work
highlighted the necessity to complement exper-
imental investigations with experiential studies
of cognition, it is important to observe that this
perspective emerged in parallel to NDM, a per-
spective that arguably combines quasi-experi-
mentalism and ethnography to study cognition
in the wild, to which we now turn.
NDM
To some decision research communities,
NDM is a relatively nascent research area
(Hodgkinson & Starbuck, 2008) focusing on
the study of cognition in real-world environ-
ments marked by ill-structured problems;
uncertain, dynamic environments; shifting, ill-
defined, or competing goals; action-feedback
loops; time stress; high stakes; multiple players;
and organizational goals and norms (Orasanu &
Connolly, 1993). Regarded as "the way people
use their experience to make decisions in field
settings" (Zsambok, 1997, p. 4), NDM has been
received as a complementary mode of inquiry
to the more classic behavioral decision-making
paradigm and research associated with heuris-
tics and biases (Connolly & Koput, 1996; Gon-
zalez, 2001; Kerstholt & Ayton, 2001; LeBoeuf
& Shafir, 2001; Kahneman & Klein, 2009). As
Gore et al. (2006) noted, the NDM movement
involves the close examination of heuristics and
the study of expertise to learn about more pow-
erful domain specific heuristics. NDM research-
ers look for what people do right rather than
what they do wrong, which is the traditional
form of inquiry inspired by Kahneman and col-
leagues (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).
In other words, much of behavioral decision
making and heuristics and biases research has
looked at errors in cognition focusing on judg-
ments for which participants have very little if
any expertise (Strack & Mussweiler, 1997;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). NDM's focus on
the positive features of expert cognition is posi-
tioned in response to the inappropriateness of
generalizing insights from the study of novices
to experts in more realistic settings. Lipshitz,
Klein, Orasanu, and Salas's (2001) focus article
"Taking Stock of Naturalistic Decision Mak-
ing" provides a good insight into the field and
documents the boundaries of the framework.
For more recent discussions of the intersections
and differences between NDM and the heuris-
tics and biases approach, see Kahneman and
Klein's (2009) article "Conditions for Intuitive
Expertise: A Failure to Disagree."
As outlined in Kahneman and Klein (2009),
NDM research emphasizes two skills: the abil-
ity to recognize patterns of previously experi-
enced cues in new situations and the ability to
notice and extract cues in unrecognized situa-
tions by drawing from past experience and
building stories (G. Klein, 1997; Lipshitz &
182 June 2013 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
Pras, 2005). Recognition-primed decision mak-
ing (G. Klein, 1993, 1997) is one model of how
cues from sensory stimuli can trigger the prob-
lem-solving process. Accordingly, the NDM
community has made significant progress in
examining decision making as an experientially
driven process through a consolidation of the-
ory and real-world applications (Johnston,
Driskell, & Salas, 1997; Hoffman, 2006; Mont-
gomery, Lipshitz, & Brehmer, 2005; Mosier &
Fischer, 2011; Schraagen, Militello, Ormerod,
& Lipshitz, 2008; Wong & Stanton, 2009).
Despite this progress, the choice in domains
of application has scarcely deviated from early
studies of firefighting, military command and
control, and nursing (Drury & Darling, 2008; G.
Klein, Calderwood, & MacGregor, 1989;
Militello & Lim, 1995). Accordingly, this work
investigates the relevance of an NDM lens to a
further field of study: day traders in financial
markets. This builds on recent discussions exam-
ining the synergies between NDM and organiza-
tional decision making (Gore et al., 2006: Lip-
shitz, Klein, & Carroll, 2006; McAndrew &
Gore, 2010) and the relevance of Orasanu and
Connolly's (1993) typology of eight defining
characteristics of NDM to this domain.
The uncertain and dynamic environments
experienced by day traders are epitomized by
the comparatively fast pace of markets in which
they work. "Real" decision problems seldom
present themselves in an entirely complete and
orderly form. Dealing with ill-structured prob-
lems, day traders expend effort (a) generating
hypotheses about the situation, (b) developing
options as appropriate responses, and (c) recog-
nizing that the situation is one permissible of
choice. Shifting, ill-defined, or competing goals
also denote the information environments
within which traders operate. Although the
overarching objective is to create profit, the
natural fluctuation and pattern of markets may
necessitate changes in trading strategies (i.e.,
trading ranges or jobbing) and positions (i.e.,
long vs. short).
NDM purports that "real" decision environ-
ments are arranged as a series of temporally
segregated events as opposed to one discrete
decision at a specific point in time. The use of
action-feedback loops to rectify early mistakes
is a characteristic of corrective action that maps
directly onto the work of day traders. This is
amplified by a rate of feedback that is almost
immediate when trading intraday positions. The
high stakes associated with such transactions
are also significant because of the uncertainty
and risk associated with the short-term volatil-
ity of markets, which necessitate instantaneous
calls of judgment and also bring a significant
amount of time stress. The financial market as
a reflection of an underlying psychological sen-
timent felt by market players at any one point in
time fits with Orasanu and Connolly's (1993)
need to appreciate the cognitive activities of
multiple players. Finally, the suggestion that the
organization may establish general goals, rules,
and standard operating procedures is reflected
in the specification of the size of trading fund
and stop losses.
In spite of this congruence, researchers have
not, until now, examined day trading from an
NDM perspective, favoring instead a behav-
ioral finance lens. Examining the role of experi-
ence in financial markets, behavioral finance
researchers have displayed a tendency to use
laboratory settings to compare expert versus
student performance. See, for instance, Ander-
son and Sunder's (1995) comparison of labora-
tory market behavior between expert commod-
ity and stock traders and MBA students. Stock
price forecasting using probabilistic judgments
of the likelihood of price increases or decreases
(Staël von Holstein, 1972) is also characteristic
of this approach although it has had limited suc-
cess. As Mieg (2001) notes, experimental tasks
of this nature lack the realism necessary for
informative conclusions, as in practice, market
prices are judged directly, not in terms of cate-
gorical judgments or probabilities. Research of
this type also neglects the role of social net-
works and intercorrelated markets as a basis of
informational leverage.
A growing trend has been the use of social
psychological approaches, such as personality
profiling to understand risk propensity (Fenton-
O'Creevy, Nicholson, Sloane, & Willman,
2005) and the application of concepts such as
emotion regulation to understand decision-
making behavior and performance (Fenton-
O'Creevy, Soane, Nicholson, & Willman,
Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 183
2011). This work has aided understanding of
the process by which day traders acquire exper-
tise: anticipation, encounter, adjustment, and
stabilization. Fenton-O'Creevy et al. (2005)
suggest that the most pertinent episodes shap-
ing trading styles include early experiences of
loss and gain, emotional experience of the for-
mer, and beliefs about the market that are based
on cause and effect and decision outcomes. The
acknowledgement, however, that risk propen-
sity is only one factor in traders' behavior
(Fenton-O'Creevy et al., 2005) suggests value
in an approach that gives credence to context,
training, and socialization. Mieg (2001), how-
ever, claims that expertise within this domain is
not experience driven. Denouncing a strong
form of expertise rooted in individual experi-
ence, Mieg displays a theoretical preference for
a weak form of expertise that results from the
use of information technologies. Key to this
proposition is his suggestion that day traders
lack insight into the complexity that drives the
market, a claim refuted in this article.
Using an intrinsically task-focused approach
that is sensitive to context, we seek both theo-
retical advancement and practical insights for
training and development within this domain. It
is also anticipated that improved understanding
of how attitudes toward risk concerning gains
and losses deviate from studies of description
and experience-based choice in the laboratory
when studied "in the wild" will hold significant
implications for other domains beyond the
immediate field of application.
This article opened with the proposition that
our understanding of experience-based choice
might be advanced through the study of cogni-
tion in the wild. The logic is such that (a) much
of prospect theory is based on a description-
based research paradigm in laboratory settings,
(b) laboratory research based on an experience-
based paradigm suggests effects different from
those demonstrated by description-based para-
digms, and (c) field research following an
experience-based paradigm might reveal effects
that meaningfully differ from both description-
based research and experience-based laboratory
research. We see promise in the use of NDM as
a lens to focus on the positive features of expert
cognition and suggest that researchers have
much to gain from the use of applied cognitive
task analysis (ACTA).
Method
We adopted a qualitative methodology aimed
at exploring decision makers' preferences using
a ground-up approach. Framed by NDM, this
examination of cognition in the wild was con-
ducted in a number of day-trading firms within
the U.K. finance industry (McAndrew, 2008).
Participants
In-depth interviews were conducted with 8
day traders (8 male; mean age = 34.8 years,
SD = 5.50). This exceeded Militello and Hut-
ton's (1998) recommendation that three to five
subject matter experts usually exhaust the
domain of analysis. Participants were recruited
from four U.K. trading firms: one bank (n = 1),
two energy providers (n = 4), and one broker-
age firm (n = 3). These firms had divisions that
traded with a proprietary element, trading for a
direct profit from the market rather than earning
commission from processing trades.
All participating firms were authorized and
regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
Participants had worked in the industry for an
average of 10.9 years (SD = 4.22) and had
acquired an average of 4.8 years (SD = 2.97) of
experience within their current position. Day
traders interviewed occupied positions ranging
from director of trading to more entry-level
positions. This range of positions does not, how-
ever, indicate novice capabilities. The one junior
trader included in this sample started trading 3
years earlier from a fund of 100,000 and pro-
vided recent examples of trades that spoke of
stop losses in the region of $13,000, implying a
current fund of $1 million to $2 million.
Materials
ACTA (Militello & Hutton, 1998) is a practi-
tioner-focused metamethod of interest to
applied psychologists working within the field
of cognition (see Crandall, Klein, & Hoffman,
2006, for discussion of the strengths and weak-
nesses of cognitive task analysis in relation to
other knowledge elicitation methods, e.g., inter-
views, observation, process tracing, and con-
ceptual approaches). Used to elicit day traders'
184 June 2013 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
expertise in experience-based choice, ACTA is
a set of knowledge elicitation and representa-
tion techniques intended to assist in identifying
the key cognitive elements required to perform
a task proficiently. The ACTA techniques were
developed to complement each other, each tap-
ping into different aspects of cognitive skill.
The first technique, the task diagram, pro-
vides the interviewer with a broad overview of
the task in question, summarized in three to six
steps. With the task diagram, this stage allows
the participant to identify the area that demands
complex cognitive skills.
The second technique, the knowledge audit,
focuses on the subtask identified in Stage 1 that
presented significant cognitive difficulty. It
allows the interviewer to review the aspects of
expertise required for successful task comple-
tion using a set of eight probes (see Table 2).
These probes are based on knowledge
Table 2: Applied Cognitive Task Analysis Probes
Probe Description
1 Past and future: Experts know how the situation developed and know where the situation
is going (de Groot, 1946/1978; Endsley, 1995; G. Klein & Crandall, 1995; G. Klein &
Hoffman, 1993). Is there a time when you walked into the middle of a situation and
knew exactly how things got there and where they were headed?
2 Big picture: Experts understand the whole situation and understand how elements fit
together (Endsley, 1995; G. Klein, 1997). Can you give me an example of the big
picture for this task? What are the major elements you have to know and keep track of?
3 Noticing: Experts can detect cues and see meaningful patterns (de Groot, 1946/1978;
G. Klein & Hoffman, 1993; Shanteau, 1985). Have you had experiences where part of a
situation just "popped" out at you, where you noticed things going on that others did
not catch? What is an example?
4 Tricks of the trade: Experts can combine procedures and do not waste time and
resources (G. Klein & Hoffman, 1993). When you do this task, are there ways of working
smart or accomplishing more with less--i.e., tricks of the trade--that you have found
particularly useful?
5 Improvising/opportunities: Experts can see beyond standard operating procedures and
take advantage of opportunities (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Shanteau, 1985). Can you
think of an example when you have improvised in this task or noticed an opportunity to
do something better?
6 Self-monitoring: Experts are aware of their own performance and notice when
performance is not what it should be and adjust to get the job done (Cohen, Freeman,
& Wolf, 1996; Glaser & Chi, 1988). Can you think of a time when you realized that you
would need to change the way you were performing in order to get a job done?
7 Anomalies: Experts can spot the unusual and detect deviations from the norm (G. Klein,
1989, 1997; G. Klein & Hoffman, 1993). Can you describe an instance where you
spotted a deviation from the norm or knew something was amiss?
8 Equipment difficulties: Experts know equipment can mislead and do not implicitly trust
equipment as novices might (Cannon-Bowers, Salas, & Converse, 1993). Have there
been times when the equipment pointed in one direction, but your own judgment told
you to do something else? Or when you had to rely on experience to avoid being led
astray by the equipment?

Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 185
categories that characterize expertise (Militello
& Hutton, 1998): diagnosing and predicting,
situation awareness, perceptual skills, develop-
ing and knowing when to apply tricks of the
trade, improvising, metacognition, recognizing
anomalies, and compensating for equipment
limitations. As aspects of expertise are elicited,
they are probed for further detail and concrete
examples (e.g., In this situation, how would you
know this? What cues and strategies are you
relying on?). It is this ability to probe a variety
of knowledge types (e.g., perceptual skills,
mental models, metacognition, declarative
knowledge, analogues and typicality, and
anomalies; G. Klein & Militello, 2005), that
provides a more complete description of cogni-
tive processes and sets the knowledge audit
aside from structured interview and task analy-
sis techniques.
A key difference between the knowledge
audit and standard forms of mental model
assessment is that the knowledge audit draws
directly from the research literature on expert­
novice differences (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986;
Hoffman, 1992; G. Klein & Hoffman, 1993;
Shanteau, 1985) and critical decision method
studies of expert decision making (Kaempf,
Klein, Thordsen, & Wolf, 1996; G. Klein et al.,
1989). This encourages participants to identify
why elements of the task may present a prob-
lem to inexperienced individuals (e.g., In what
ways would this be difficult for a less-experi-
enced person? What makes it hard to do?),
emphasizing the applied utility of this method.
The knowledge audit has been developed to
capture key aspects of expertise, improving and
streamlining data collection and analysis. It
allows the interviewer to explore and probe
issues such as situation assessment, potential
errors, and how a novice would respond to the
same situation, shedding light on the content
and structure of knowledge. Whereas experi-
ence-based choice research has employed ver-
bal and nonverbal assessment probes leading to
inferences about the forms of data underlying
mental representations (see Camilleri & New-
ell, 2009a), ACTA is an entirely verbal method.
The open-endedness of ACTA's probes permits
participants to respond using probabilistic terms
or nonverbal numerical representation systems,
crucial for studying cognition as it occurs in the
wild.
An optional third stage, the simulation inter-
view, allows the interviewer to better under-
stand participants' cognitive processes within
the context of a challenging scenario. This can
be useful in highlighting differences in expert­
novice perspectives and in developing training
and system design recommendations.
Finally, a cognitive demands table merges and
synthesizes data from all participants across the
stages. This is intended for practitioner use to
focus the analysis and identify common themes
in the data. See Militello and Hutton (1998),
Crandall et al. (2006), or the ACTA multimedia
instructional CD (Militello, Hutton, & Miller,
1997) used in preparation for these interviews
for a more detailed review of this approach.
Some of the limitations associated with ACTA
are highlighted in our discussion. As a method,
however, it offers promise, providing provoca-
tive insight into human cognitive processes.
Researchers have successfully used ACTA in
empirical work to understand expertise in a
diverse range of areas, including weather fore-
casting (Hoffman, 1992, 2006; Hoffman &
Militello, 2008; Hoffman, Shadbolt, Burton, &
Klein, 1995; Hoffman, Trafton, & Roeber,
2006), clinical nursing (Militello & Lim, 1995),
firefighting (G. Klein et al., 1989), recruitment
(Gore & Riley, 2004; Gore & McAndrew,
2009), and military command-and-control oper-
ations (Drury & Darling, 2008). ACTA has
provided a significant development in available
tools and techniques for the identification of
training needs in knowledge-based work, pro-
viding instructional designers with clearer
guidelines when designing training for cogni-
tively demanding tasks in domain specific areas.
Reliability and validity. With no established
metrics, cognitive task analysis methods have
been open to critique on the grounds of reliabil-
ity, validity, and falsification. With arguably
appropriate standards for one model of science
only (one in which scientific inquiry prevails),
this work is aligned with the perspective that
there exists "particular ways of warranting
validity claims rather than as universal, abso-
lute, guarantors of truth" (Mishler, 1990, p. 420).
This more pluralistic interpretation of validity
186 June 2013 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
has been considered appropriate for NDM (Lip-
shitz et al., 2001). Mishler (1990) suggests that
inquiry-led research (such as NDM) ought to be
evaluated using the criteria of credibility and
transferability. Credibility is defined as the
degree to which the study's findings and conclu-
sions are warranted, and transferability as the
extent of case-to-case translation.
Recognizing Kaplan's (1964) proposition
that research methods should drive the selection
of evaluation criteria, Militello and Hutton
(1998) have attempted to establish the reliabil-
ity and validity of ACTA using alternative indi-
cators. Questions of validity included the fol-
lowing: Does the information gathered address
cognitive issues? Does the information gath-
ered deal with experience-based knowledge as
opposed to classroom-based knowledge? Do
the instructional materials generated contain
accurate information that is important for nov-
ices to learn? Reliability was ascertained by
determining whether ACTA was able to consis-
tently generate relevant cognitive information
across participants. Findings indicated high
levels of validity and reliability, with modal
statistics occurring in the range of 90% to 95%.
This is in line with interrater reliability statistics
for this study, which were in the range of 78%
to 85% for the task diagrams, knowledge
audits, and cognitive demands table.
Procedure
Each interview lasted approximately 2 hr.
The interviews opened with a discussion of the
types of financial instruments and assets traded.
When familiar with the domains of expertise,
we completed Stages 1 and 2 of ACTA. During
Stage 1, each participant was asked to outline a
broad overview of his chosen task and to iden-
tify the most cognitively demanding element.
Stage 2 required the researcher to ask a series of
questions using the eight probes, recording
notes in a knowledge audit table. Following
data collection, each interview was transcribed.
Transcripts were used to ensure technical accu-
racy of the knowledge audits. The average
transcript was 12,653 words in length, more
than 100,000 words in total.
The knowledge audits were then merged to
produce a cognitive demands table representing
the key elements deemed to be cognitively
complex. Each of the eight aspects of expertise
composing the knowledge audit was considered
in turn. For instance, we integrated participants'
responses to the past and future aspect of exper-
tise consecutively, each time clustering com-
mon knowledge together and forming new
themes of previously untapped knowledge.
This process continued until the eight aspects of
expertise had been populated with information
from each knowledge audit. What resulted was
a clustering of the key cognitive demand(s) for
each aspect of expertise, added to the growing
repository of the cognitive demands table on
the basis of salience and frequency. This pro-
cess of synthesizing and arranging the data
thematically was important in ensuring repre-
sentativeness across the 8 participants.
Results
Because of the wealth of qualitative data
generated, an illustrative example is used to
outline the results derived from Stages 1 and 2
of ACTA. For Stage 2, the knowledge audit,
results are presented with a number of extracts
to provide a sense of the data elicited. We then
provide a summary of the cognitive demands
identified across our sample as a whole. The
cognitive demands are organized according to
prospect theory's fourfold pattern of choice and
are used to illustrate the nature of preferences in
experience-based choice as studied in the wild.
Illustrative Example: Day Trader
A (Foreign Exchange [FX] and
Bullion Trader, London)
Background demographics. Day Trader A is
25 years old and holds 7 years of experience
within the investment industry.
Stage 1: Task diagram. The task diagram for
Day Trader A focuses on "FX spot transactions"
(see Figure 1). Spot transactions involve the
agreement to buy and sell at the present market
value and to settle the transaction a few days
later. The four broad decision components
underpinning the execution of FX spot transac-
tions are considered in turn:
The first component involves establishing
what currency pair is going to form the basis of
the trade. This stage is often informed by day
Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 187
traders' attention to news releases and their
assessment of its likely impact on foreign cur-
rencies. Directing attention toward the most
liquid and widely traded currency pairs oper-
ates as a lens through which to filter incoming
news releases, enabling rapid decision making.
The second stage of the task diagram
involves decisions related to currency pair per-
formance, that is, which currency is going to
perform or not perform. By focusing on one
particular currency pair, the field of choice is
significantly narrowed, constraining the cues
attended to.
The third broad stage entails decisions
regarding the size of the trade and level at
which the market will be entered. For instance,
this may involve the identification of a level
(support or resistance) that if broken, a given
security is bought (pullback) or the identifica-
tion of a dip in the market as an opportunity to
buy. As the domain of choice narrows, decision
making becomes increasingly associated with
the logistics of placing a trade. However, the
decision process underpinning this twofold
choice is the most technically demanding.
For Day Trader A, technical analysis was
noted to often drive this stage through consider-
ation of support and resistance levels on chart
points. One mechanism used to identify levels
was Fibonacci retracements. Fibonacci retrace-
ments assume that any given security will
retrace a percentage of the previous move
before reversing.
The final stage of the task diagram involves
the selection of levels from which a given posi-
tion is exited (commonly referred to as trade
management). This is integral both for instances
where profit has been maximized and capital
needs to be locked in, thus controlling profit
risk, and for instances whereby a position is
losing money and needs to be stopped out to
maintain a positive profit and loss statement.
Complex component. The third stage, that is,
size of the trade and entry levels, was identified as
the most cognitively complex component within
Day TraderA's task diagram and formed the focus
for the rest of the interview. This was similar to
other traders' task diagrams, although in addition
to the size of the trade and entry levels, exit levels
were also noted to be cognitively complex.
Stage 2: Knowledge audit. Table 3 provides
an extract from Day Trader A's knowledge
audit. The two illustrative examples presented
here are discussed in more detail below.
Big picture. The "big-picture" element of
expertise is useful in describing the broad-level
framework traders use to construct their view of
FX markets and the actions they take. Four
components were found to frame what Day
Trader A attends to (again, this was very similar
to other traders):
In trading FX markets, the dominant focus
was noted to be movements in the major and
minor currencies. Staying cognizant of world-
wide currency movements both enables and
acts as a filter to other aspects, such as funda-
mental and technical analyses.
The second aspect composing the big picture
is fundamental analysis. This involves tracking
the fundamentals behind the currency driving
the market at a given moment in time. As Day
Trader A elaborated, understanding the strength
of the economy is informed by a number of
standardized parameters, including GDP.
The third component of the big picture
relates to the use of technical analysis, that is,
forecasting the future direction of markets
through the study of past market data. Ignoring
the actual nature of the market, technical analy-
sis employs models and trading rules based on

price and volume identified by market cycles
and recognition of chart patterns. As Day
Trader A explained, understanding past market
performance and levels of resistance within the
market, entry and exit levels can be identified.
It appeared that in general, choice of charting
methods and trading approach, such as the
placement of resting orders in the market,
reflects the degree of individual preference in
experience-based choice.
The final aspect of the big picture, relates to
traders' need to remain cognizant of desk and
individual targets. As can be seen in Table 3,
Day Trader A notes the need to play the "per-
centage game," that is, limit risks and run prof-
its. Providing a description of the overall pref-
erences and constraints framing day traders'
thinking, the next example taken from the
knowledge audit demonstrates these in action.
Noticing. This aspect of expertise focused on
the detection of market movements in minor
currency pairs, with the collapse of the Thai baht
(THB) and significant price move of the New
Zealand dollar (NZD) as examples. Monitoring
the market activity of major and minor currency
pairs, Day Trader A suggested that in his experi-
ence, large, rapid movements are usually driven
by data releases. Data releases might include the
release of monetary policy statements expecting
the NZD to weaken in New Zealand or shock
wave­type releases, such as a bomb explosion.
Known as "news trading," rapid price move-
ments require the immediate placement of a
position. As Day Trader A warns, the source of
movement should not be located until after a bid
has been placed, or the opportunity will be lost.
This example, alongside cognition elicited from
other traders using the noticing prompt, illus-
trates how incoming data sources can instanta-
neously direct day traders' attention to a
particular currency, thereby constraining deci-
sion choice. Underscored by a preference for
maximizing profit, the knowledge audit captures
the importance of experience-based choice in
knowing to immediately place a position.
Cognitive Demands
A cognitive demands table was compiled that
synthesized data drawn across the eight knowl-
edge audits from the day traders. The objective

Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 189
of this stage of ACTA is to provide a generic
overview of (a) the difficult cognitive elements,
(b) why it is difficult for a novice, (c) errors a
novice might commonly make, and (d) cues and
strategies that experienced day traders use to
overcome cognitively difficult elements. Over-
all, six common elements of expertise that exhib-
ited significant cognitive demands for the day
traders interviewed were extracted (see Table 4).
Each cognitive element listed represents a
single scenario day traders might encounter.
Note that although these tend to exist singu-
larly, they may also occur in combination with
other difficult cognitive elements; for example,
detecting regime shifts might occur alongside
anticipating effect of change in market funda-
mentals. Arranging cognitive activity in this
way, the cognitive demands table provides a
variety of real-world examples of preferences
across the spectrum of medium-, large-, and
small-probability gains and losses.
Combining prospect theory and cognitive
demands. Organized according to prospect the-
ory's fourfold pattern of choice, the cognitive
demands included in Table 4 are now presented
alongside their implications for understanding
preferences in experience-based choice.
Medium- and large-probability gains. Iden-
tifying emerging trends and arbitrage opportu-
nities are two cognitive demands that reveal day
traders to exhibit a risk-seeking preference for
medium- and large-probability gains.
Identifying emerging trends. This example
represents a basic trading methodology
where risks are limited and profits run,
articulated as playing the percentage
game. The identification of emerging
trends relies on a number of indicators,
such as technical analysis and Fibonnaci
retracements, that assist in the detec-
tion of entry points into a rising or fall-
ing market. Accordingly, these cues and
strategies are used to optimize the condi-
tions that are risk seeking for gains with
medium and large probabilities.
Arbitrage opportunities. This type of execu-
tion is similarly risk seeking for gains,
with an acceptance of the risks where the
potential gain is a much higher probability.
Exploiting price discrepancies between
errors in bid and offer prices represents a
"free trade," with zero risk for acquiring a
large probability gain.
Small-probability losses.The cognitive demand
of responding to trend reversals illustrates how
scenarios evolve in which traders are risk averse
to small-probability large losses.
Responding to trend reversals. One of the
cognitively challenging elements of
decision making within this domain is
responding to a change in market condi-
tions after a position has been placed. A
common error can stem from the naive
belief that the reverse trend is only
momentary, instead of immediately clos-
ing the position to minimize losses. If one
ignores the stop loss in the hope that the
market will change direction and lead to
a profit, there is a small probability that
this will produce a large loss and close the
account. Traders are therefore risk averse
to the small probability of a large loss.
Small-probabilitygains.Thecognitivedemands
table also indicates choice behavior for gains
with small probabilities to be risk averse. There
are two specific instances, detecting regime
shifts and anticipating effect of change in mar-
ket fundamentals, that illustrate how this might
occur.
Detecting regime shifts. One of the common
errors day traders encounter is errone-
ous interpretation of price movement.
This coupled with the desire to adopt a
position on emergent trends before other
market players so as to maximize poten-
tial gains might, for those with less expe-
rience, induce a risk-averse preference
for small-probability gains.
Anticipating effect of change in market fun-
damentals. This difficult cognitive ele-
ment is integral to the detection of regime
shifts, and so in a similar vein to the above
example, day traders exhibit risk-averse
preferences for small-probability gains.
Common errors can include errors in
extrapolation and thereby basing hypoth-
eses on small-probability scenarios.

Medium- and large-probability losses. The
cognitive demands table also illustrates the case
of risk-averse preferences for medium- and
high-probability losses. Taking action following
sudden interruption to supply is a case in kind.
Taking action following sudden interruption
to supply. In the event of sudden inter-
ruption to supply and a collapsing mar-
ket, risk-averse preferences can lead one
to "overreact" and close out all positions
or to take no action, which mitigates the
loss. Promptly covering short positions
(buying back the same type and number
of securities previously sold) can assist
in the minimization of losses.
These results suggest the fourfold pattern of
preferences of experience-based choice when
studied in the wild to be risk seeking for
medium- and high-probability gains, risk averse
for small-probability gains and losses, and risk
averse for medium- and high-probability losses
(see Table 5).
Discussion
Documenting a field study of expertise using
a detailed cognitive task analysis, this study
crucially begins to reveal the origins and con-
tents of day traders' preferences and how these
constrain and enable experience-driven action.
Our research suggests that there is value in
adopting a naturalistic approach and under-
scores the timeliness of Hertwig and Erev's
(2009) suggestion to take the study of experi-
ence-based choice "into the wild."
This study makes a distinct contribution
toward Rakow and Newell's (2010) call to better
understand the properties of the internal represen-
tation of payoffs. Reviewing examples that sit at
the intersection of description and experience,
this research illustrates how day traders construct
their understanding of gains relative to losses and
emphasizes the relevance of prospect theory for

understanding how attitudes toward risk concern-
ing gains and losses deviate from studies of
description and experience-based choice in the
laboratory when studied in the wild.
We start by making reference to the notion of
the percentage game--one where risks are lim-
ited and profits run--as a basic trading method-
ology. Risk seeking for gains with medium and
large probabilities, traders understand that
across a period of time, probabilities will weigh
in their favor (gains × probability > losses ×
probability). See lower left quadrant of Table 5.
Arbitrage opportunities are similarly risk
seeking for gains, with an acceptance of the
risks where the potential gain is a much higher
probability. Note that arbitrage is analogous to
the sure bet of $1 from described choice. This
is an interesting finding both because patterns
of choice for medium and large probabilities is
underresearched and because it sits antitheti-
cally with the speculative proposition that in
decisions from experience, participants show
risk aversion for medium- and large-probability
gains (Rakow & Newell, 2010).
Theoretically, one would assume traders to be
unequivocally risk seeking in the domain of
gains. However, our findings suggest choice
behavior for gains with small probabilities to be
risk averse (see upper left quadrant in Table 5).
Detecting regime shifts and anticipating effect of
change in market fundamentals illustrate how
preferences for small-probability gains can mani-
fest as scenarios evolve. The explanation accom-
panying the cognitively complex element of Day
Trader A's task diagram supports this finding,
drawing attention to the role of organizational
constraints, such as daily stop losses and the per-
centage game, in avoiding account drawdown.
Strategies of this type are uncommon within the
domain of trading, a finding more likely to be
found in the wild as opposed to conditions of
descriptive choice within the laboratory. Our
work does, however, concur with findings pro-
posing that for small probabilities, participants
are risk averse both for experience-based prob-
lems examined in the laboratory and in the wild.
On the note of small-probability events, the
findings outlined within this article also suggest
traders to be risk averse to the small probability
of a large loss (see upper right quadrant in Table
5). The cognitive demand of responding to
trend reversals illustrates how the purpose of
stop losses is to close a trade at a predetermined
level so that large losses are not incurred. Risk
aversion for small-probability losses echoes the
findings within the paradigm of description but
not experience-based choice in the laboratory.
Knowledge gained through this study also
leads one to speculate about choice behavior in
the conditions of medium- and large-probabil-
ity losses (see lower right quadrant in Table 5).
The example of taking action following sudden
interruption to supply illustrates how sudden
changes can induce preferences for risk-averse
action, for example, covering short positions to
minimize losses. We wonder whether within
this domain, choice following successive losses
might also illustrate this type of preference? We
note Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) proposi-
tion that "a person who has not made peace
with his losses is likely to accept gambles that
would be unacceptable to him otherwise" (p.
287) as justification of this hypothesis.
As a whole, this work opposes the sugges-
tion that "there is little evidence of a difference
in patterns of choice under description and
experience when the probabilities are moderate
to large" (Weber, Shafir, & Blais, 2004, p.10).
In fact, whereas Rakow and Newell (2010)
hypothesized risk-averse choices for medium-
and large-probability gains and risk-seeking
choices for medium- and large-probability
losses within the decisions-from-experience
paradigm, this study suggests the converse.
Table 5: The Fourfold Pattern for Decisions Studied "in the Wild"
"Cognition in the Wild"
Probability Gains Losses
Small probabilities Risk aversion Risk aversion
Medium and large probabilities Risk seeking Risk aversion
Preferences in Experience-Based Choice 193
This insight is crucial where patterns of choice
for medium and large probabilities remain
underresearched and supports our hypothesis
that field studies following an experience-based
paradigm might reveal effects that meaning-
fully differ from both description-based and
experience-based laboratory research.
Shifting preferences between these two for-
mats of choice and decision making as studied
in the wild underscore the asymmetry of human
choice. In accounting for the differences in
preference, we consider whether, for decisions
from experience, there exist a number of sub-
types. The first takes the form of experience
through learning, whereby repeated exposure
to the processes molds the responses. This is of
the type studied with the lens of experience-
based choice. The second, experience through
professional training, is one whereby organiza-
tions set the fourfold pattern of responses, and
experience simply sets out to achieve them.
This experience type distorts the fourfold pat-
tern exhibited within description and experi-
ence formats of choice seen in Table 1. For
instance, although we might expect to see risk-
seeking preferences for small-probability gains
(we generally expect traders to be risk seeking
for gains, risk averse for losses), experience
through professional training overrides this.
This insight holds consequences for the design
of instructional training for novices.
The implications of the conceptualizations
of experience through learning and experience
through professional training might also extend
to other complex sociotechnical systems, such
as aviation and the military--domains in which,
on the basis of this research, one would expect
expert performance to be similarly risk averse,
with the exception of risk-seeking behaviors for
medium- and large-probability gains. The
impact of these findings hold potential to trans-
fer beyond the domain of study in this article
and are worthy of detailed exploration within
the NDM community.
Other decision-making perspectives might
also take value from these findings. Calling
attention to the value of context is an approach
thatmovesbeyondbehavioralfinanceapproaches
(Anderson & Sunder, 1995; Staël von Holstein,
1972) and begins to build a more complete pic-
ture of how context, training, and socialization
interweave to facilitate understanding of risk
propensity. This is an important advancement
that sits alongside the work of Fenton-O'Creevy
et al. (2005). Future examinations of risk pro-
pensity might benefit further from emerging
discussions of naturalistic studies of insight and
intuition in field settings (Gore & Sadler-Smith,
2011; G. Klein & Jarosz, 2011).
This work also holds implications for ACTA,
a method that has been endorsed as a useful
addition to the instructional design practitio-
ners' toolkit. Providing a significant extension
to studies employing the ACTA techniques, this
study also illustrates its relevance for inductive-
theory building.
Limitations
This research has some important limita-
tions. First, although we have located our work
within the theoretical framework of NDM (G.
Klein, Orasanu, Calderwood, & Zsambok,
1993; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2001; Zsambok &
Klein, 1997) and experienced-based choice, we
recognize that despite two decades of empirical
inquiry, NDM still requires further rigorous
testing and theoretical development if the study
of expertise in applied settings is to progress.
Second, as in all research conducted in the
wild, participants subscribe to norms of organi-
zational behavior and to common narratives
about the nature of their domain expertise. It
has been proposed that "NDM research needs
to pay more attention to three things in relation
to organizations: constraints imposed by con-
text; distributed information; and differentials
in power and vested interests" (Gore et al.,
2006, p. 936). The degree to which these guide
the evolution of preferences in experience-
based choice lies outside the remit of the cur-
rent research but warrants further study. In
addition, it would be interesting to note what
further value a cultural lens might bring to in-
the-wild studies (H. Klein, 2004).
The third limitation questions the degree to
which the fourfold pattern of choice exhibited
by day traders extends to other domains when
studied in the wild. This issue of generalizabil-
ity also leads one to question the validity of the
notion of experience through professional train-
ing as an explanatory account of the differences
between experience-based choice as studied
194 June 2013 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
within the laboratory and in the wild. Although
we acknowledge generalizability to be a sig-
nificant shortcoming of qualitative research, we
attest to the value of studying cognition in the
wild as a means of identifying new possibilities
for future research.
The fourth limitation is methodological,
directly relating to the design of research con-
ducted outside of the laboratory. We recognize
the relentless work of applied researchers to
resolve the dilemma of both gathering rich quali-
tative data with techniques such as ACTA and
reconciling issues surrounding validity, reliabil-
ity, the presentation of data to enact meaning, and
the importance of replicable data analysis for
future research. We are also aware of the diffi-
culty of comparing findings from studies of cog-
nition in the wild with those from description and
experience-based choice within the laboratory,
and we acknowledge that this opens the possibil-
ity that our findings are a function of method.
Future work might rectify these shortcomings by
focusing attention on the development of quasiex-
perimental approaches to accessing cognition in
applied settings. ACTA provides a theoretically
grounded foundation for the development of
instructional content for this objective.
Future Research
Despite the limitations of these data, this
work provides the opportunity for others to test
the conjectures brought forth by this field study.
Using this article and the insights it has gener-
ated as a foundation, we have developed a num-
ber of testable questions to guide future research.
Does the four-fold pattern of choice exhib-
ited by day traders in the wild extend
to other domains? Overcoming the lim-
its of generalizability, what can the study
of other domains reveal about the nature
of preferences when studied in situ?
What can we learn from the conceptual-
ization of experience through profes-
sional training? Future research should
seek to identify further domains that sup-
port or contest this hypothesis. How do
domains supporting the proposition of
experience through professional training
skew the properties of the internal repre-
sentation of payoffs?
How does the study of experience through
learning in the wild translate to the four-
fold choice of experience in the labora-
tory? Understanding choice behavior in
the wild when manifest in the condition
of experience through learning is crucial
for elucidating the parameters that guide
preference.
Conclusion
This article demonstrates the value in taking
the examination of experience-based choice into
the wild. Our approach has started to illuminate
the origins and contents of day traders' domain
preferences and how these constrain experience-
driven action. This naturalistic examination
emphasizes the relevance of prospect theory for
understanding the internal representation of
payoffs and the asymmetry of human choice:
Preferences concerning gains and losses as stud-
ied with the lens of cognition in the wild differ
from the fourfold pattern of preferences exhib-
ited by experience-based choice when studied in
the laboratory. Accounting for these differences,
we conclude with the proposition that when
studying cognition in the wild, one ought to
make the distinction between the study of expe-
rience through learning and experience through
professional training. We anticipate this research
to pose a challenging and innovative starting
point from which future collaborations across
the decision sciences can develop.

Claire McAndrew is a chartered psychologist and
research associate in the Complex Built
Environment Systems research group at The
Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University
College London, United Kingdom. She completed
her PhD in naturalistic decision making at the
University of Surrey, United Kingdom, in 2008.
Her ongoing research combines social science
and design modes of enquiry in the study of cogni-
tion and behavior in physical and virtual
environments.
Julie Gore is a chartered psychologist, associate fel-
low of the British Psychological Society, and senior
lecturer in organizational behavior at the University
of Surrey, United Kingdom. She completed her PhD
in applied psychology at Oxford Brookes University
in 1997. Her research focuses on the application of
behavioral science to management research, in par-
ticular, cognitive psychology, cognitive task analy-
sis, and a long-term interest in naturalistic decision
making (having first joined the naturalistic decision-
making community in Dayton, Ohio, in 1994).
