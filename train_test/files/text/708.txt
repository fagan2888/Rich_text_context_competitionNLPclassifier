American Grandparents Providing Extensive
Child Care to Their Grandchildren: Prevalence
and Profile
Esme Fuller-Thomson, PhD,1 and Meredith Minkler, DrPH2
Purpose: This study sought to determine the prevalence
and profile of grandparents providing extensive care for a
grandchild (grandparents who provide 30 hours per
week or 90 nights per year of child care, yet are not the
primary caregiver of the grandchild). Design and meth-
ods: Secondary analysis of the 3,260 grandparent re-
spondents in the 1992­94 National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH). Extensively caregiving grand-
parents were compared with custodial grandparents
(those with primary responsibility for raising a grandchild
for 6 months), noncaregivers, occasional caregivers
(10 hours per week), and intermediate caregivers using
chi-square tests, one-way analysis of variance tests, and
logistic regression analyses. Results: Close to 7% of all
grandparents provided extensive caregiving, as did
14.9% of those who had provided any grandchild care in
the last month. Extensive caregivers most closely resem-
bled custodial caregivers and had least in common with
those grandparents who never provided child care. Impli-
cations: Areas for future research, policy, and practice
are highlighted, including the potential impact of welfare
reform legislation on extensively caregiving grandparents.
Key Words: Family child care, Grandparent caregiving,
Later-life families
The last decade has seen increasing awareness
among health and social service providers, research-
ers, policy makers, and the general public of the sub-
stantial number of grandparents who provide child
care on a regular basis to their grandchildren. As
Hirshorn (1998) has pointed out, such activities as
routinely getting young children ready for school in
the mornings, providing full-time child care for pre-
schoolers, or serving as a custodial parent to children
whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide
care "move the grandparent out of the more tradi-
tional older-generation-in-the-family roles . . . and
into roles typically assumed by a child's parents" (p.
200). As she further noted:
In so doing, grandparent caregiving stretches, reorga-
nizes, and redefines the relationships between family
members; redraws the boundaries of family and, of-
ten, of household units; and redirects the transfer of
resources within the family (Hirshorn, 1998, p. 200).
Since 1970, two notable and diverging trends in
grandparent care for grandchildren have been ob-
served. On the one hand, this period saw a dramatic
76% increase in the number of children under 18 liv-
ing in households maintained by a grandparent. The
number of children in such households grew from 2.2
million (3.2%) in 1970 to 3.9 million (5.5%) in 1997,
with particularly rapid growth since 1980 (Lugaila,
1998). In an estimated one third of these homes nei-
ther parent was present and, since 1990, by far the
fastest growth has been in these "skipped generation"
households (Casper & Bryson, 1998) in which grand-
parents are typically the sole or primary caregiver. A
number of factors help explain the increase in grand-
parents raising grandchildren, including parental sub-
stance abuse, teen pregnancy, AIDS, unemployment,
and incarceration, as well as legal and policy changes
favoring kinship care over other placement arrange-
ments (Burnette, 1997; Minkler, 1999).
Although custodial care among grandparents has
increased substantially, the proportion of young chil-
dren for whom noncustodial grandparents and other
relatives are the main source of child care has de-
clined dramatically, corresponding to the rise in
more formal center-based child care arrangements. A
fivefold increase in center-based child care (from 6%
to 30% of all child care arrangements) occurred be-
tween 1965 and 1993, whereas family day care use
remained constant at about 17% and nonparental
relative care declined from 33% to 25% (Hofferth,

1996). When the discussion is confined to preschool
children whose mothers work full time, 1993 census
data indicate that more than one million preschool-
ers are cared for by their grandparents (Casper,
1996). This figure represents 16.6% of preschoolers
whose mothers work full time (Casper, 1996) and
5.4% of all preschoolers (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000).
Increased female labor force participation (affect-
ing both young mothers and midlife grandmothers),
the rise in single-headed households (leaving mothers
with fewer relatives to call upon for assistance), and
a growing parental belief in the value of nonfamily
child care in socializing young children for school ap-
pear largely to have spurred these changes (Hofferth,
1996). Although noncustodial grandparents no longer
constitute the primary source of nonparental child
care for children, they remain frequently called-upon
sources of child care on a regular basis. Research by
Baydar and Brooks-Gunn (1998) using 1987­88
data from the National Survey of Families and
Households, for example, suggested that 43% of
grandparents provided child care for their grand-
children at least once monthly. Similarly, Bass and
Caro's (1996) research, using national field poll
data, found that 32% of individuals with grandchil-
dren or great grandchildren had provided care for at
least one hour during the previous week. Of those
providing care, 13.6 hours constituted the average
time devoted to this activity. Data like these are help-
ful in highlighting the high proportion of grandpar-
ents who provide at least some care to their grand-
children on a weekly or monthly basis. Yet, they tell
us little about those grandparents who, while not de-
fining themselves as the primary caregiver of their
grandchildren, nevertheless provide extensive child
care on a regular basis.
Surprisingly few studies have focused primarily on
grandparents who play a substantial role in caring
for their grandchildren without crossing the line to
become primary caregivers (Caputo, 1999). In one
such study, Presser (1989) examined the economic
complexities involved in child care provision by
grandparents who were providing substantial care-
giving to assist a parent and concluded that the jug-
gling of work and family roles in these situations
may be substantial. Folk and Beller's (1993) research
also examined the provision of child care by relatives
within the context of maternal employment, noting a
continued preference for such care, particularly for
very young (age 3) children. Finally, several re-
searchers have examined the often extensive child
care and related roles of grandmothers in assisting
their teenage daughters who have become mothers
(Burton & Bengtson, 1985; Flaherty, 1988; Cherlin
& Furstenberg, 1986).
The present study was designed to provide a pro-
file of American grandparents who provide extensive
secondary child care to their grandchildren, and to
compare and contrast this population group with
those who are not providing such care along a vari-
ety of social and demographic dimensions. To in-
crease our understanding of the continuum of child
care provision for grandchildren, a typology was cre-
ated that enabled us to conduct five-way compari-
sons. We compared (1) noncustodial extensive child
care providers, (2) grandparents who self-defined as
having been the primary caregiver for their grand-
children (custodial grandparents), (3) grandparents
providing no child care (noncaregiver), (4) grandpar-
ents providing 10 hours a week of child care for
their grandchildren (occasional caregivers), and (5)
grandparents providing 10­29 hours of care (inter-
mediate caregivers).
Methods
Sample
The grandparents analyzed in this study were a
subsample drawn from the larger two-wave nation-
ally representative panel study, the National Survey
of Families and Households (NSFH). The surveys
were conducted by the Center for Demography and
Ecology at the University of Wisconsin­Madison. In
1992, 1993, or 1994, 10,008 respondents were inter-
viewed. They comprise 77% of the original 13,008
respondents interviewed during the first wave of data
collection in 1987 and 1988. Questions on grandpar-
ent caregiving only occurred in the second wave of
data collection; therefore, all analyses reported here
are restricted to the 1992­1994 data. In the second
wave, 3,477 reported having one or more grandchil-
dren. Once we deleted from the sample those who
had provided custodial care during the 1980s or ear-
lier but who were no longer doing so during the
1990s and those who had missing information on
care provision, 3,260 subjects remained. Of these re-
maining respondents, 223 provided extensive care-
giving during the second wave of interviews, 173
were custodial grandparents during the 1990s, 1,319
provided no care, and 757 provided occasional care.
An additional 788 grandparents provided intermedi-
ate care.
In order to adjust for nonresponse and for over-
sampling of ethnic minorities, nontraditional fami-
lies, and recently married people, a weighting vari-
able was constructed by the NSFH. This weighting
represents a sample that is demographically represen-
tative of the coterminous United States. All analyses
reported in this study are weighted. (Further details
on the study design and questions can be found in
Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988).
Measures
As noted above, we developed five categories: one
self-defined primary caregiver category (custodial
grandparents) and four groups who did not define
themselves as the primary caregiver (extensive, inter-
mediate, occasional, and noncaregivers).
"Extensive" caregivers were providing a signifi-
cant proportion of their grandchild's care although
they did not report themselves as the primary care-
giver. We operationalized this variable in two ways:
Grandparents were included if they (1) provided at
203
Vol. 41, No. 2, 2001
least 30 hours of child care in an average week and/
or (2) cared for grandchildren for at least 90 nights
per year.
Thirty hours a week was decided upon as the cut-
point in the first instance because it reflects a sub-
stantial portion of the grandparents' week--approxi-
mately 6 hours a day for 5 days. To determine
grandparents in the NSFH who provided 30 or more
hours a week babysitting, a proxy measure was con-
structed. All respondents were asked how many
hours in an average week they spent helping their
child and/or children age 19 or over, including all the
following kinds of help: shopping and/or transporta-
tion; work around the house; advice or support; and
child care. If the grandparents did not report having
primary responsibility for raising a grandchild, yet
they did state that they helped with child care and
that they provided help for 30 or more hours a week,
they were included in our subsample of 30 hour-
a-week child care providers. In the cases where the
respondent provided child care and one or more of
the other types of assistance to their adult children, it
was assumed that child care represented the largest
proportion of this time. The nonspecificity of the du-
ration question leaves some room for false positives
(e.g., inclusion of some people who provided child
care for 10 hours and housework for 20 hours).
However, the authors believe that this error will be
relatively rare.
Our second type of extensively caregiving grand-
parents reported that a grandchild and/or grandchil-
dren stayed overnight at their house, without their
parents present, for at least 90 nights per year.
Ninety nights was chosen because this exceeds the
average length of a child's summer holidays. Al-
though taking care of a grandchild for 2 months in
the summer reflects a significant contribution of en-
ergy and a life-style change, we felt that the 3-month
cutpoint would limit the analysis to only the most
heavily involved caregivers. If grandparents met the
criteria for either form of caregiving, they were de-
fined as "extensive caregivers" (n  223). Note that
we could not translate the nights per year into an av-
erage hours per week value and sum the combined
value of the two types because in some cases nights
may reflect only 8­12 hours of caregiving (e.g., while
the grandchild's parent is working a night shift),
whereas in other cases "nights" reflect 24 hour-a-day
care (e.g., while the child visits for a month in the
summer).
Intermediate caregivers provided child care for a
grandchild between 10 and 29 hours a week and/or
had their grandchild stay overnight without his or
her parent for 7 to 89 nights.
Occasional caregivers provided between 1 and 9
hours of child care in an average week and/or had a
grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents
1­6 days in the past year.
Noncaregiving grandparents provided no babysit-
ting during an average week and, in the past year,
had not had a grandchild stay overnight without his
or her parents.
Custodial caregivers were grandparents who re-
plied affirmatively to the question, "For various rea-
sons, grandparents sometimes take on the primary
responsibility for raising a grandchild. Have you ever
had the primary responsibility for any of your grand-
children for 6 months or more?" and who reported
beginning or ending caregiving during the 1990s.
Caregivers who reported they had been primary care-
givers but were no longer caregiving during the
1990s were removed from the sample so as not to
confound the analysis. (For a more detailed discus-
sion and analysis of this group, see Fuller-Thomson,
Minkler, & Driver, 1997.)
A total of 10 independent variables were included
in the analyses. Demographic variables included age,
gender, race (African American vs other), marital
status (married vs other), education (high school
completion vs not), geographic region (South vs
other), and poverty status (above or below the pov-
erty line). Familial variables included total number of
grandchildren and location of nearest child (coresi-
dent, within 20 miles, more than 20 miles away). Fi-
nally, self-reported closeness to grandparents was
measured using the question, "On a scale from 0 to
10, where 0 is `not at all close' and 10 is `extremely
close,' how would you describe your relationship
with your grandchild(ren)?"
Statistical Analyses
Overall prevalence of caregiving type was deter-
mined by generating a frequency of the five catego-
ries of caregivers for all grandparents. We also were
interested in the percentage of extensive caregivers
among three distinct subgroups of grandparents: (1)
those who had at least one grandchild under age 5 (n 
1,950), (2) those who had provided some child care
to their grandchildren during the previous month
(n  1,305), and (3) those who had provided at least
some child care in the previous month for their
grandchildren while their adult child was working
(n  813). These percentages were obtained through
frequencies of caregiving type for each identified sub-
sample.
To determine differences among the caregiving
type for demographic variables, chi-square tests were
used for categorical variables, and one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) tests were used for interval
and ratio level variables. For those variables that
reached the level of significance, it was necessary to
conduct a further test to determine which of the
grandparent types differed significantly from the ex-
tensive caregiving category. For the ratio and interval
level variables, Tukey's honestly significant differ-
ence post-hoc tests were conducted. For the categori-
cal variables, subanalyses were conducted doing pair
by pair chi-square comparisons. To keep the overall
significance level at .05, the pairwise comparisons'
significance level was reduced to .013 (from .05 for
overall significance/4 sets of comparisons).
In order to assess the independent contribution of
each predictor variable while controlling for the
204 The Gerontologist
other variables in the equation, it was necessary to
conduct four logistic regression analyses with exten-
sive caregiving coded 1 and the other four caregiving
categories used in succession as the reference cate-
gory. In the first case, the sample was restricted to
extensive caregivers (n  204) and noncaregivers (n 
1,174) who had complete data for all the indepen-
dent variables in the analysis. In the second case, the
sample included only extensive caregivers (n  204)
and occasional caregivers (n  713) with complete
data. The third analysis was limited to extensive care-
givers (n  204) and intermediate caregivers (n 
736) with complete data. The final analysis included
only extensively caregiving grandparents (n  204)
and custodial caregivers (n  151) with complete
data. This method provided odds ratios for extensive
caregivers in comparison to noncaregivers, occa-
sional caregivers, intermediate caregivers, and custo-
dial caregivers. In each analysis, all 10 independent
variables were entered in a block.
In addition to the odds ratios, two other statistics are
reported: the R statistic and the Nagelkerke R-squared.
The R-statistic measures the individual partial corre-
lation between the dependent variable and each in-
dependent variable in logistic regression analyses
(Norusis, 1997). The Nagelkerke R-squared value is
analogous to the R-square in a linear regression
model (Norusis, 1997). The larger the R-squared
value, the greater the explanatory power of the com-
bination of the independent variables.
Results
Using the four categories of caregivers defined
above, 6.8% of all grandparents were serving as exten-
sive caregivers at the time of the interview. In contrast,
40.4% of the grandparents in the total sample were
noncaregivers, 23.3% were occasional caregivers,
24.2% were intermediate caregivers, and 5.3% had
provided custodial care at some time during the 1990s.
Grandparents who were providing both extensive and
custodial care (n  67) were classified as custodial care-
givers--a fact which may have resulted in an underesti-
mation of the proportion of extensive caregivers.
Age of grandchildren clearly played an important
role in influencing the likelihood of extensive care
provision, with 9% of all grandparents with a grand-
child under age 5 being extensive caregivers.
Of grandparents interviewed during the 1990s,
1,305, or 40.4%, had provided some child care to
their grandchildren during the previous month. Of
these, 14.9% were extensive caregivers. When the
sample was further restricted to the 813 respondents
who had provided at least some child care in the pre-
vious month for their grandchildren while their adult
child was working, the percentage of extensive care-
givers rose to 20.2%.
As indicated in Table 1, significant differences
within the five categories of grandparents were evi-
dent for all the characteristics investigated. Post-hoc
tests provided further information on which pairs
within each analysis were significantly different.
In comparison to noncaregivers, bivariate analyses
indicated that extensive caregivers were significantly
younger (56.4 vs 66.8 years), more likely to be mar-
ried (73% vs 59%), African American (17% vs 9%),
female (65% vs 52%), to have coresident children
(51% vs 24%), and to have reported greater close-
ness to their grandchildren (9.6 vs 7.8 on a 10-point
scale); see Table 1. The groups were statistically sim-
ilar with respect to educational level, geographic re-
gion, income, proportion below the poverty line, and
total number of grandchildren. In order to determine
the individual contribution of each independent vari-
able while other variables are held constant, a logis-
tic regression analysis of extensive caregivers versus
noncaregivers was performed (see Table 2). This
analysis showed that, in comparison to noncaregiv-
ers, the odds of being an extensively caregiving
grandparent were 87% higher for married grandpar-
ents, 53% higher for grandmothers, and 77% lower
for those who live more than 20 miles from all their
children. The odds of being an extensive caregiver
were higher for younger respondents (odds ratio
[OR]  0.92 for age), for those with more grandchil-
dren (OR  1.08), and for the grandparents who re-
ported greater closeness to their grandchildren (OR 
1.73). The R statistic indicates that age and closeness
to grandchildren are the variables in the model that
provide the most explanatory power.
In contrast with occasional caregivers, extensively
caregiving grandparents were significantly younger
(56.4 years vs 59.5 years) and more likely to be Afri-
can American (17% vs 8%), female (65% vs 54%),
to live in the South (43% vs 30%), and to have
coresident children (51% vs 34%). Extensive care-
givers were poorer than occasional caregivers; they
had a lower mean income ($34,286 vs $47,389) and
were more than twice as likely to live below the pov-
erty line (18% vs 8%). Extensive caregivers were less
likely to have graduated from high school (67% vs
81%) and reported greater closeness with their grand-
children (mean scores of 9.6 vs 9 on a 10-point
scale); see Table 1. The logistic regression analysis
comparing extensive and occasional caregivers, re-
ported in Table 2, indicates that respondents who
lived below the poverty line had 89% higher odds
and high school graduates had 37% lower odds of
being extensive caregivers. In comparison to those
who had coresident children, the odds of extensive
caregiving were low for those whose nearest child
lived nearby and even lower for those whose nearest
child was more than 20 miles away (OR  0.63 and
0.50, respectively). Those who reported greater
closeness with their grandchildren also had higher
odds of providing extensive care (OR  1.32).
In comparison to intermediate caregivers, exten-
sive caregivers were significantly younger (56.4 years
vs 58.9 years), more likely to be African American
(17% vs 11%) and to have coresident children (51%
vs 32%), and less likely to be a high school graduate
(67% vs 77%); see Table 1. Extensive caregivers
earned, on average, approximately $7500 less per
year and were 6% more likely to be living below the
205
Vol. 41, No. 2, 2001
poverty line than intermediate caregivers. The logis-
tic regression analysis (see Table 2) indicates that ex-
tensive caregivers had much lower odds than inter-
mediate caregivers of all their children living outside
the grandparent's home. The odds were 47% lower
that the children of extensive grandparents lived be-
tween 1­20 miles from the home as opposed to being
coresident. The odds of children living more than 20
miles from the grandparent's home were 57% lower
for extensive caregivers.
Custodial and extensive caregivers were similar
with respect to most characteristics (see Table 1).
However, extensive caregivers were more likely to be
married (73% vs 54%) and less likely to be African
American (17% vs 27%) or female (65% vs 77%).
Extensive caregiving grandparents also had fewer
grandchildren than did their custodial caregiving
peers (5.2 vs 7.3 grandchildren). In the logistic re-
gression analyses, married respondents had twice the
odds of being extensive caregivers (see Table 2).
With each additional grandchild, the probability of
providing extensive as opposed to custodial care de-
creased by 5%.
Discussion
The fact that 6.8% of the grandparents in this na-
tional sample were currently caring for a grandchild
on an extensive basis suggests that one out of every
15 American grandparents may be doing the equiva-
lent of almost a full-time job in terms of the hours
devoted to this activity. It should be noted, more-

Notes: Noncaregivers are grandparents who provide no babysitting during an average week and, in the past year, have not had a
grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents. Occasional caregivers are grandparents who provide between 1 and 9 hours of
babysitting in an average week and/or have had a grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents 1­6 nights in the past year. Inter-
mediate caregivers provide 10­29 hours of babysitting a week and/or overnight care 7­89 nights in the past year. Extensive caregivers
are grandparents who provide 30 or more hours of babysitting in an average week and/or have had a grandchild stay overnight without
his or her parents 90 or more nights in the past year. All four of the above caregiving groups do not define themselves as the primary car-
egiver. Custodial caregivers are grandparents who define themselves as having primary responsibility for a grandchild or grandchildren
for a period of 6 months or more which began or ended in the 3 years preceding data collection.
p values are based on the chi-square statistic for proportions and one-way ANOVAs for means. For variables that reached the level of
significance in the chi-square test or one-way ANOVA, post-hoc paired comparisons were conducted by chi-square tests and Tukey's
HSD tests, respectively.

over, that the denominator here includes grandpar-
ents who may be very elderly or ill, and those who
are geographically at a considerable distance from
their grandchildren. When we limited our analysis to
those grandparents who had provided some child
care in the last month (40.4% of the grandparent
sample), almost 15% were providing extensive child
care, as were one in five (20.2%) of those who re-
ported providing child care while their adult child
worked. The latter finding is in keeping with earlier
national studies by Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich, and
Holcomb (1991) and others (Brayfield, Deich, &
Hofferth, 1993), who found that 19% of preschool-
ers whose mothers worked in 1990 were receiving
child care primarily from grandparents and other rel-
atives, rising to 28% for low-income preschool chil-
dren.
Our finding that 9% of all Americans with grand-
children under age 5 were providing extensive care-
giving to a grandchild is considerable higher than the
U.S. Census Bureau's estimate that 5.4% of all pre-
schoolers in 1993 were being cared for by a grand-
parent while the mother was in full-time employment
(Casper, 1996). The fact that the census data are re-
stricted solely to caregiving while the grandchild's
mother is working full-time is the likely cause of the
discrepancy between the two figures. The 30 or more
hours grandparents provide care per week may, in
fact, be a combination of hours spent babysitting for
different families of grandchildren, each of which
had a mother who worked. Similarly, the 30 hours
may include time spent babysitting while the grand-
child's parents are not at work. The inclusion of 90
or more nights in our extensive caregiving category

Notes: Noncaregivers are grandparents who provide no babysitting during an average week and, in the past year, have not had a
grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents. Occasional caregivers are grandparents who provide between 1 and 9 hours of
babysitting in an average week and/or have had a grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents 1­6 nights in the past year. Inter-
mediate caregivers provide 10­29 hours of babysitting a week and/or overnight care 7­89 nights in the past year. Extensive caregivers
are grandparents who provide 30 or more hours of babysitting in an average week and/or have had a grandchild stay overnight without
his or her parents 90 or more nights in the past year. These four caregiving groups do not define themselves as the primary caregiver.
Custodial caregivers are grandparents who define themselves as having primary responsibility for a grandchild or grandchildren for a pe-
riod of 6 months or more that began or ended in the 3 years preceding data collection.
Reference categories are, respectively, unmarried respondents, non-African Americans, males, respondents who did not complete high
school, respondents living outside the South, respondents living at or above the poverty line, and respondents with coresident children.

widened the scope of caregiving to include extended
visits and part-time night-shift work.
It should be recalled that, with the exception of
custodial caregiving, the measures utilized in this
study assessed only caregiving during the past year. If
we were to consider the percentage of grandparents
providing extensive care at some point in their lives,
the estimates cited would undoubtedly be consider-
ably higher.
Finally, as noted earlier, the rates of extensive
grandchild care provision revealed in our study omit
two small but important groups: grandparents who
were providing such care to the offspring of teenage
children, and those who at some point in the 1990s
were primary caregivers to one or more grandchil-
dren. Despite recent declines, the continuing high
rates of teenage childbirth in the United States re-
sulted in almost half a million live births in 1999
(Curtin & Martin, 2000). Earlier research, suggest-
ing that grandparents play a particularly important
caregiving role for the children of teenage parents
(Burton, 1990; Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986), under-
scores the importance of further research that in-
cludes this category. Similarly, the omission from our
sample of extensive caregivers of the 67 respondents
who were providing both custodial and extensive
care decreased the percentage of extensive caregivers
from 9% to the just under 7% reported.
When we turned from prevalence to a sociodemo-
graphic profile of grandparents providing extensive
care to their grandchildren, an interesting picture
emerged. As suggested above, the majority of grand-
parents playing this role were married White women
in their mid 50s who had five grandchildren and were
as likely as not to have one of their own children re-
siding with them. Most were high school graduates,
and the mean 1993 income was over $34,000.
Our finding that extensive caregivers were signifi-
cantly younger than noncaregivers is understandable,
because younger grandparents are likely to be in bet-
ter health and hence physically and mentally better
able to provide extensive child care than their non-
caregiving counterparts. The greater prevalence of
extensive caregiving among grandmothers than grand-
fathers similarly is in keeping with much earlier so-
ciological research (Abel, 1991; Hochschild, 1989)
suggesting that women do the bulk of caregiving
over the life course. However, our finding that over a
third (35%) of extensive caregivers were men (com-
pared to just 23% of custodial caregivers) suggests
that a sizable proportion of grandfathers do in fact
provide considerable care for grandchildren on a reg-
ular basis, and underscores the need for further study
of this population.
Although, as noted earlier, the majority of exten-
sive grandchild care providers in our study were
White women, the fact that such grandparents were
considerably more likely than noncaregivers, as well
as occasional and intermediate care providers, to be
African American also is in keeping with the litera-
ture (Hunter, 1997). Such extensive care provision
thus has been shown to be more normative among
African Americans, for whom the role of "caregiver
across the generations" has been a critical one histor-
ically. African American caregiving thus is rooted in
West African culture and tradition (Sudarkasa, 1981;
Wilson, 1989) and played a critical role in the United
States during and after slavery and during the great
migrations north after World War II (Wilson, 1989).
Although most grandparents reported that they
were quite close to their grandchildren, the extra
contact experienced by extensive caregivers was as-
sociated with significantly higher reports of closeness
than was experienced by noncaregivers and those
providing only occasional child care. This associa-
tion may reflect the fact that greater contact allows
for a closer bonding with grandchildren--a phenom-
enon also observed among custodial and intermedi-
ate care providers. An alternate explanation is that
closer attachment to grandchildren motivates a grand-
parent to undertake the extensive caregiving role.
Further qualitative research into the nature and nu-
ances of such closeness, from the perspective of both
grandparents and grandchildren, is needed to help
enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.
Extensive caregivers more closely resembled inter-
mediate caregivers than either noncaregivers or occa-
sional caregivers. However, extensive caregiving grand-
parents were from more vulnerable populations than
their peers providing intermediate care: they were
more likely to be poor, for example, and less likely to
have completed high school. The presence of coresi-
dent children (which is also likely to increase the
odds of coresident grandchildren) is a strong predic-
tor of extensive as opposed to intermediate care pro-
vision. Such higher rates of coresidence may reflect
fewer living arrangement options as a result of low
income and related factors, but further research
would be needed to substantiate this hypothesis.
A major finding of this study was that extensive
caregivers appeared to resemble custodial caregivers
to a much greater degree than did those who pro-
vided only occasional child care. For example, al-
though just 8% of occasional child care providers
lived below the poverty line, the figure was far higher
(18%) for extensive caregivers and highest of all
(23%) for custodial parents. Since grandparents who
are poor are more likely to have grandchildren who
also live in low-income households, it may well be
that the former's heavy involvement in child care
provision reflects, in part, the prohibitive costs of
much organized child care (Casper, 1996).
There were, of course, areas of significant differ-
ence between extensive and custodial caregivers. The
fact that the latter were more likely to be unmarried,
to be female, and to have more grandchildren, for
example, is in keeping with earlier studies (Chalfie,
1994; Fuller-Thomson et al., 1997; Harden, Clark,
& Maguire, 1997), which demonstrated major dif-
ferences between custodial and other grandparents
along these dimensions. Similarly, the fact that custo-
dial grandparents were significantly more likely to be
African American than were extensive caregivers in
the bivariate analyses is in keeping with the far
208 The Gerontologist
higher rates of custodial grandparenting among Afri-
can American grandparents, one in four of whom oc-
cupies this role for at least 6 months (Szinovacz,
1998). The earlier mentioned similarity between ex-
tensive and custodial grandparent caregivers along
multiple dimensions, however, is of major conse-
quence and may indeed reflect a blurring of the line
between these two roles, as grandparents move from
one to the other as need dictates. The impressive
body of literature on custodial grandparents gener-
ated over the past decade (Burnette, 1999; Burton,
1992; Chalfie, 1994; Emick & Hayslip, 1996; Fuller-
Thomson et al., 1997; Minkler & Roe, 1993; Pruchno,
1999; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998) needs to be
supplemented by studies that explore in more detail
the lives of both extensive and custodial grandpar-
ents, with particular attention to the trajectory of the
caregiving experience over time.
In addition, the evolving nature of the continuum
of child care provision by grandparents needs to be
carefully explored within the context of the changing
demographic, cultural, and sociopolitical landscape
of the United States. The rapid growth of a variety of
both Latino and Asian Pacific Islander populations,
for example, underscores the need for far greater re-
search attention to the grandparental child care pro-
vision roles of these largely neglected groups (see Bur-
nette, 1999, and in press for important exceptions).
Changes over time in the extent and nature of child
care provision within such groups as a result of accul-
turation and other factors also should be explored
through both qualitative and quantitative studies.
Finally, sociopolitical factors, including, impor-
tantly, the implementation of welfare reform legisla-
tion, merit careful attention. A key informant study in
California (Minkler, Berrick, & Needell, 1999), for
example, revealed considerable concern among policy
analysts and providers that the Personal Responsi-
bility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act's
(1996) work requirements and the requirement that
unmarried teenage mothers live with a parent or
guardian and either attend school or hold a job as a
condition of aid, could well result in an increasing
number of middle-aged and older women being pres-
sured to become extensive child care providers for
their grandchildren. The fact that over half of exten-
sive caregivers in this study had coresident children (as
opposed to 29% of noncaregivers) suggests that such
grandmothers may already be providing considerable
family care, and additional responsibility for nonresi-
dent grandchildren may pose a substantial burden. As
Mullen (2000, p. 129) has noted, most states "have
largely neglected" the impact of welfare reform on
grandparents, and efforts are needed to both monitor
this issue and help ensure that grandparents are sup-
ported, rather than penalized, if they indeed become
extensive child care providers to grandchildren as a
consequence of the changing welfare environment.
Finally, as Casper and Bryson (1998, p. 14) have
argued, "grandparents and their grandchildren would
benefit greatly if policies and programs intended to
help traditional parent­child families in times of
need could be extended to grandchildren" and the
grandparents who often play a substantial role in
their care.
