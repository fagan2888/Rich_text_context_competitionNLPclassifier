To provide more accurate estimates of Helicobacter pylori infection in the US population, IgG
antibody levels were measured in serum from 2581 persons aged 6-19 years examined during phase
1 of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 24.8% of participants
had evidence of H. pylori infection. Infection was strongly associated with increasing age Wtrend,
P < .01) and being nonwhite (17.0% of non-Hispanic whites vs. 40.1% of non-Hispanic blacks and
42.0%of Mexican Americans infected). In a multivariate logisticregression model, H. pylori infection
was significantly associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07/year), being nonwhite (non-
Hispanic black OR = 2.6 or Mexican American OR = 1.8), poverty (OR = 1.5), crowding (OR =
5.6), and- head of household education level (OR = 1.8). In Mexican Americans, infection was
associated with birth outside the United States or Canada in the univariate analyses but was not
significantly associated after adjustment for age, poverty, crowding, and head of household education
level.
Helicobacter pylori is recognized to be a major cause of
type B gastritis and is strongly associated with duodenal and
gastric ulcer disease and possibly with the development of
gastric cancer [1, 2]. Over the past decade, a number of studies
have described the epidemiologic characteristics of this im-
portant pathogen; however, methodologic shortcomings have
limited their interpretation. Only three population-based studies
have been done [3-5], one in children [3] and none in a US
population. We examined the prevalence of H. pylori infection
in a representative sample of children and adolescents in the
United States and identified subgroups who may be at increased
risk for infection.
Methods
Survey design. The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) is a periodic national survey conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The survey is designed to provide data on

the health and nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
population through household interviews and standardized physi-
cal examinations. NHANES III was conducted from 1988 through
1994 and divided into two 3-year surveys (phases 1 and 2). Data
presented here are from phase 1 (October 1988 through October
1991).
NHANES III is based on a multistage probability-sample design.
Children <5 years of age, persons ~60 years of age, Mexican
Americans, and non-Hispanic blacks are included in the survey at
a higher rate than other persons. To produce national estimates, the
results for each person are weighted to account for the differential
probabilities of selection and response [6]. Details of the sample
design have been published elsewhere [7].
Laboratory methods. H. pylori IgG concentrations were de-
termined using an ELISA according to the manufacturer's in-
structions (PYLORI STAT; Whittaker Bioproducts, Walk-
ersville, MD). A predictive index value was calculated, and if
the value was equivocal, that subject was excluded from the
study (n = 131). In children, the PYLORI STAT ELISA has a
reported sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 94%, with posi-
tive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respec-
tively [8].
Variables. Three mutually exclusive racial and ethnic
groups were created on the basis of the NHANES III sample
design; non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic blacks
(blacks), and Mexican Americans. Persons not included in one
of these groups were included only in the estimates for the total
population.
The level of education of the head of household was dichoto-
mized to either less than a high school education or at least a
high school education. The poverty-index ratio was calculated by
dividing the total family income by the poverty threshold adjusted
for family size for the year of the interview [9, 10]. A poverty
index ratio < 1 was considered to indicate poverty. A crowding
index ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of persons
in the household by the number of rooms in the household exclud-
ing bathrooms.
JlD 1996;174 (November) Concise Communications 1121
Urbanicity was based on the subject's place of residence and
was categorizedas urban or nonurban by Bureau of Census defini-
tions for size of place.
The variableUS/Canadian-bornwas created and limited to Mex-
ican-Americanparticipants, because the sample size for whites and
blacks was too small to be included in the analysis.
Current household exposure to pets, exposure to cats and dogs
specifically, and day care attendance (available for 6- to 16-year-
olds) were examined. We were unable to evaluate water supply
as a risk factor since the majority of participants used private or
public company water. Breast-feeding information was available
only for children <6 years of age and therefore could not be
analyzed in our study.
Statistical analysis. All prevalence estimates were weighted
to account for oversampling, lack of response to the household
interview, and lack of physical examination. Population estimates
were based on weights stratified according to the Census Bureau's
Current Population Survey for March 1990 [6, 11].
Standard errors were calculated with SUDAAN, statistical soft-
ware designed for complex surveys [12]. Multivariate analyses
were done using logistic regression. The weighted odds ratios
(ORs) and 95%confidenceintervals were based on SEs incorporat-
ing the complex sample design.
The possibility of any interaction between a potential risk factor
and ethnicity was explored using logistic regression analysis. No
interaction terms reached significance at P ~ .10.
Independentpredictors for H. pylori infection for the combined
population were determined using stepwise multivariate logistic
regression modeling procedures with P ~ .05. Separate models
containing these predictors were also done for each of the ethnic
groups.
Since, often, there were multiple subjects from the same house-
hold in our sample, the analyses were repeated on a subset con-
sisting of one subject randomly selected from each household.
Results
Overall, 24.8% of the US population 6-19 years of age had
antibodies to H. pylori (table 1). The prevalence of infection
increased with age from 16.7% in 6- to 9-year-olds to 26.2%
in 10- to l4-year-olds and to 29.1% in 15- to 19-year-olds (X2
test for trend, P < .01). There were no significant gender
differences for any ethnic group. A significantly higher propor-
tion of blacks (40.1%) and Mexican Americans (42%) had
evidence of infection compared with whites (17.0%). Because
of the strong effect of ethnicity on the prevalence of infection,
the analyses in table 1 were stratified by ethnicity. Table 1
shows seroprevalence estimates for each variable in the total
population and in each ethnic group.
Poverty was associated with higher estimates of infection in
the total population (P < .01) and in each ethnic group, though
this variable was significant only in Mexican Americans (P <
.01). Children living in households in which the head of house-
hold had less than a high school education had a significantly
higher prevalence of infection in the total population and each
ethnic group. Crowding was significantly associated with
higher estimates ofinfection in the total population and among
blacks and Mexican Americans (P < .01).
Mexican Americans born outside the United States or Can-
ada were found to have significantly higher estimates of infec-
tion (58.4%) than those born in the United States or Canada
(37.1%) (P < .01).
The presence of a pet in the household was associated with
a lower estimate of infection in the total population (P < .01),
although not significant in any group. In addition, exposure to
cats but not dogs was associated with a lower estimate in the
total population (P < .01).
For the total population and each ethnic group, children who
attended day care were less likely to be infected than those
who had not; however, only for the total population did the
prevalence estimate reach statistical significance. For Mexican
Americans, those residing in nonurban areas had a significantly
higher estimate of H. pylori infection than those in urban areas.
Independent predictors of H. pylori infection were deter-
mined by logistic regression (table 2). The following were all
significant predictors: increasing age (OR = 1.07/year), being
black (OR = 2.6) or Mexican American (OR = 1.8), living in
poverty (OR = 1.5), educational level (OR = 1.8), and the
highest level of crowding (OR = 5.6).
Our analysis with one randomly selected subject from each
household yielded results similar to those presented.
Discussion
We used data from NHANES III to produce the first popula-
tion-based estimates of the prevalence of H. pylori infection
in the United States and explored relationships of various risk
factors for infection. The overall prevalence of infection in our
study was higher than previously published estimates of 5%-
15% for US children and adolescents [1]. In fact, prevalence
estimates in blacks and Mexican Americans in NHANES III
are closer to those in developing than developed countries [2].
This higher prevalence in the United States is most likely due
to a more accurate measurement of risk in a representative
sample of the US population rather than in persons in selected
groups.
The prevalence of H. pylori infection increased with age, as
has been seen in other studies. The design of the study is cross-
sectional and it is therefore not possible to determine whether
this increased risk is due to a cohort effect. However, with the
narrow age range in our study population, a cohort effect seems
unlikely as an explanation of this finding.
Although previous reports of estimates in US children and
adolescents have been lower than the estimates in our study,
two studies examining H. pylori and ethnicity in US children
found slightly higher estimates of infection. A study in an
Arkansas hospital population found black children had more
infection (50%) than white children (25%) [13]. Similarly, in
a New Orleans study, 49% of black and 32% of white children
receiving medical care at two hospitals were infected [14].

Table 2. Independent predictors of H pylori infection determined
by multivariate analysis.
These findings may be explained by selection factors such as
age distribution, socioeconomic status, geography, and hospi-
tal-based samples ofpersons who may be in poorer health than
the general population.
Other studies, like ours, have shown H. pylori infection to
be more prevalent in groups with low socioeconomic status [4,
13-15]. In the Arkansas study, H. pylori was more common
in children from low-income than from high-income families,
even within racial categories [13]. Two studies of adults in
Wales found age-specific prevalence of H. pylori to be highest
in adults in the lowest social or manual classes [4, 15]. In
addition to poverty, we found that the education level of the
head of household was an important predictor of H. pylori
infection.
Several studies, like ours, have shown crowding to be a
risk factor for H. pylori infection. In Wales, adults sharing
a bedroom in childhood were more likely to be infected with
H. pylori than those not sharing a bedroom [15]. Similarly,
in London, domestic crowding in childhood was found to be
an independent risk factor for current infection in adults
[16].

Among Mexican Americans, birth outside the United States was
an important risk factor for infection in the univariate analysis.
However, in the multivariate analysis, this variable did not remain
significant.To clarify whether foreign-born status had a modulating
influence on the effects of crowding and poverty, the possibility of
interaction was examined. No interaction was found; however,
small sample sizes precluded more detailed analysis.
The decreased estimates of infection in subjects attending day
care and insubjects exposed to pets most likely represent surrogate
measures of higher socioeconomic status. Neither day care nor
pet ownership was significantly associated with infection in the
multivariate analysis.
Our results support previous associations with socioeconomic
factors such as poverty and education level but add ethnicity and
crowding as additional important risk factors for infection. The
differences between ethnic groups may be attributed to genetic,
social, or cultural differences. There may be an increase in suscep-
tibility among blacks and Mexican Americans or there may be
more intense exposure, possibly due to a higher prevalence of
infection in family members. Sanitation practices may also play
a role, since increased prevalence was consistently seen in groups
with a lower socioeconomic level and crowded living conditions.
Further exploration of the reasons for the dramatic differences
between whites and nonwhites should be examined.
With the large numbers of children infected with H pylori,
questions arise with regard to screening and management of chil-
dren for this infection. At this time the natural history ofinfection
in children is unclear. Risk factors for development of symptom-
atic disease and the later consequences of infection have not yet
been determined. The personal and economic costs of these dis-
eases in the United States and worldwide emphasize the need to
understand the impact of early infection. An important finding of
this study is that even in developed countries such as the United
States, H pylori may be acquired very early in life. This informa-
tion will aid researchers in determining whether and when to
immunize children once vaccines become available.
