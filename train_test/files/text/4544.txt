The purpose of this article is to examine two possible causes
of why schools and students underperform. Specifically, I
wish to deal with the perceived lack of student achievement
in K-12 schools in the United States. It is my aim to examine
the attribution of causation for underachievement as pro-
posed in the conventional wisdom. Furthermore, I will offer
a different suggestion for the cause of the "problem." What
this article does not do is to offer a real solution to the prob-
lem. As the reader will see, if my suggestion has merit, the
solution is neither simple nor clear. It will require effort and
ingenuity (innovation) from many quarters.
Many stakeholders in the United States have addressed
the problem of student achievement. Comparing student
achievement to expectations derived from state and national
benchmarks has arrived at the conclusion that students are
not achieving at a satisfactory level of performance.
Furthermore, many point to international comparisons as
evidence of underachievement of U.S. students. Finally, it
appears that many students lack the skills necessary to suc-
ceed in college or the workplace. The conclusion of many is
that U.S. students are far behind where they should be when
it comes to academic achievement.
It is no secret that some have questioned whether the
"problem" is as severe as some commentators and lawmak-
ers claim. Many claim, for example, that U.S. scores on the
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) are
consistent rather than declining. Still, other measures lead
stakeholders to conclude that American students are lagging
behind. (See Bracey, 2008, for an evaluation of what various
assessments prove and fail to prove.)
In this article, I wish to examine two possible interpreta-
tions of the cause of the problem. The first cause sees the
problem as more narrowly educational. The solutions to the
problem, in this view, involve adjusting, what we might call,
educational factors. This is the view that represents the domi-
nant educational and political orthodoxy of the day.
The second cause I will describe as more broadly societal.
This viewpoint seems to be more associated with the Great
Society days of U.S. policy. However, there are new factors
that require that Americans take a closer look at this point of
view. This article suggests that the broadly societal view of
the problem of inadequate achievement is better at describ-
ing the problem than the narrowly educational view.
The Narrowly Educational View
In the educational view, the issue of the achievement gap,
both in international as well as national terms, is seen as a
failure of schools. This failure involves two main compo-
nents. The first is a lack of rigorous standards for schools. The
second component of school failure is inadequate, inept, and,
perhaps, incompetent teachers. The solutions here mostly
center around creating and establishing higher standards and

The Demise of Education or the Eclipse
of Compassion? Exploring the Causes of
Academic Underachievement
James Alexander1
Abstract
Many stakeholders are concerned with the apparent failure of schools to facilitate children achieving at high levels. One
explanation of the failure of schools takes a more narrowly focused educational view. In this perspective, the problem is one
of inadequate standards and poor teachers. In a second, broadly societal view, the problem of student achievement seems to
be a complex societal problem, not easily amendable to strictly educational solutions. The two positions are compared and
contrasted. Examples of societal factors affecting student achievement are explored. It is suggested that the broadly societal
view provides a better explanation of why students fail to succeed.

removing poor teachers while ensuring the quality of new
teachers.
There are those who, while recognizing an achievement
gap,takeamorenuancedposition.InTheGlobalAchievement
Gap, Tony Wagner (2008) describes some of the challenges
faced by schools. The challenges, while incorporating con-
cerns about academic achievement, are more far-reaching
than that. Perhaps the main difficulty is a lack of creativity--
innovation. For Wagner, what our educational system funda-
mentally lacks is not more standardized tests. The problem is
one of shallowness of the curriculum and the failure to
emphasize critical thinking.
In his video, The Finland Phenomenon, Wagner investi-
gates the educational system of Finland--considered by
many accounts to be the best in the world. Many of the direc-
tions that U.S. reformers are taking are a clear departure from
the standard of excellence typified by the Finnish system. In
Finland, there seems to be little in the way of the "testing
frenzy" that characterizes U.S. schools. Also, the Finnish sys-
tem is characterized by demonstrating trust in the wisdom of
teachers rather than taking a punitive approach to improve-
ment of instruction. In short, Wagner admits there is a prob-
lem with education in America but seems to believe that
stakeholders are perhaps "missing the boat" when it comes to
solutions.
Standards
For many, the first line of attack when it comes to failing
schools is to tighten standards and make standards more rig-
orous. For the past 30 years at least, there has been a move to
institute standards that define exactly (or nearly so) what stu-
dents should be able to do and what they should know at any
given instructional level. This is usually combined with some
criterion-referenced assessment scheme that aims to measure
student attainment of the prescribed standards.
There have been many "versions" of generally agreed
upon benchmarks. Originally, these benchmarks were delin-
eated by the various states. Still, if one were to examine stan-
dards from state to state, one would find a general agreement
in what was expected of students and teachers. Of course,
this doesn't mean that there is no variation, both historically
and presently. But the general thrust of standards tends to
reflect common concerns.
I have noted, talking with teachers and administrators,
that often realignment and revision of standards appear to
many as merely "shuffling" things around a bit. Standards
are framed and reframed, but the basic core remains the
same. Normally, mastery of standards is assessed in discrete
ways using items on criterion-referenced tests. The combina-
tion of standards and testing leaves the system open to criti-
cism by some.
The main critique tends to be that all of this leads to
"teaching to the test." Beginning in the mid-70s, my work as
a public school teacher was in the area of primary grades
remedial reading. The state in which I was teaching put into
place a mastery testing system in the mid-80s. At that point,
descriptors of what should be taught and when it should be
taught were provided to schools. These standards (or perhaps
at that point, proto-standards) were assessed by discrete
items on a statewide test. The expectation was that my
Chapter I (Title I) reading students would improve in the
tested areas.
Following the general guidelines, I began to teach to the
discrete testing areas. The result? My students' vastly
improved test scores. In fact, many "tested out" of remedial
reading classes. The problem was that the classroom teachers
still felt that many of these students did not read well. It
seems, the idea of teaching to the test becomes a critique of
the system because it is felt that such teaching is far too
narrow.
The latest foray into the world of standards in the United
States is the creation and implementation of the Common
Core State Standards (Common Core State Standards
Initiative, 2012). The promoters and adopters of these stan-
dards (most of the states) see these standards as more rigor-
ous and broader than former attempts. In the 2012 Brown
Center Report, "How Well Are American Students
Learning?" (Loveless, 2012), the success or potential suc-
cess of standards (such as the Common Core State Standards)
in addressing student achievement is explored. In looking at
standards historically, the Report finds little in the way of
success. Furthermore, the Report questions whether new or
revamped standards, namely, the Common Core, are an
improvement over earlier standards. The creation of stan-
dards is an ever-growing, never-ceasing endeavor. However,
the Report suggests that a different approach is required. In
short, standards are not succeeding. Of course, it might be
argued that the failure of revamped and newly minted stan-
dards to improve achievement leads to many adjustments
and improvements in pedagogical approaches--as standards
are continually reworked and fine-tuned. As a curriculum
guide, the Common Core State Standards may prove quite
useful. The reality, however, is that standards are often
mainly used as a rationale for test items; more feared than
used judiciously. Certainly, new standards lead to higher lev-
els of accountability for teachers as well as students.
Overall, are the new standards likely to improve the situ-
ation? The standards movement has existed for many years.
It seems as if, when faced with less success than expected,
the idea is that everything will work out if we can just find
the "right" standards (or perhaps the right way to word them).
Although many schools (perhaps most) say that they are
implementing the Common Core State Standards, and
although virtually all teachers and administrators state that
they understand the standards, few teachers believe that the
Standards will improve student learning (MetLife, 2013).
Teachers
The other major area of education reform deals with teachers--
namely getting rid of poor teachers and improving the quality
Alexander 3
of the rest. On the face of it, it is difficult to see how anyone
could realistically differ with that goal. What we need, how-
ever, is to look a bit more closely.
Bracey (2008) suggests that those who raise the cry of
reform most loudly are "playing fast and loose with the
truth." The notion of a failing education system that can be
fixed by working to get rid of teachers is deeply flawed.
Oftentimes, the problems of "failing schools" is laid at the
feet of teachers. Yet many of these schools are high-need,
high-poverty schools. The idea of getting rid of the teachers
that are charged with causing the failure and replacing them
with more competent, motivated teachers is unlikely to suc-
ceed. Few teachers, especially new ones, will want to take on
a class of kids who are desperately poor, working far below
grade level, and seem to lack motivation (of course, some
will).
Overall, the goal of reformers of improving the teacher
pool is having an impact. In a 2007 report, Gitomer (2007)
details the profile of recent graduates of education colleges:
1. Candidates have higher GPA's than in the past.
2. Praxis pass rates have decreased, largely due to
higher standards put in place over the last several
years.
3. The academic profiles of candidates has markedly
improved.
4. The improvement in subject-specific areas is espe-
cially noted in those pursuing secondary
certification.
Even though this data was reported in 2007 (6 years ago),
the perception remains that teachers are largely incompetent
and lack academic qualifications for the job. This is true,
even though admission to college departments of education
often requires higher academic and test performance than
other degree programs.
Although there is a general tendency to blame lack of
achievement on classroom teachers, regardless of the quality
of the teaching force for the last several years, that may be a
faulty assumption. The notion is that many teachers are
incompetent and/or lazy. While this may sound like a worth-
while observation in the aggregate, it breaks down in the par-
ticular. I have worked with preservice teachers for many
years in three states. In the classroom of practicing teachers,
where my students are placed for field experiences, I observe
little in the way of incompetent, ineffective teachers.
Furthermore, most building principals in U.S. schools rate
their teachers as very good or excellent (MetLife, 2013).
Certainly, there is little, if any, incentive for principals to
retain and praise ineffective teachers. In fact, principals in
this age of high accountability would likely have a vested
interest in getting rid of poor teachers.
The common notion adopted by many proponents of edu-
cational "reform" is that the most reliable and accurate
appraisal of student learning and teacher performance can be
found in standardized tests. In a report of a recent study
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sawchuk
(2013) casts doubt on the common orthodoxy. The study
found that the best evaluations of teacher effectiveness
involved a combination of teacher observations, student per-
ceptions of teacher effectiveness, and standardized test
scores. The study finds that relying most heavily on stan-
dardized test data is counterproductive. Also, such data does
not offer much predictive value when it comes to student per-
formance on more cognitively demanding tasks.
In a recent survey of teachers and principals, MetLife
(2013) documented the following trends:
1. Only 39% of teachers reported being very satisfied
with their jobs (the lowest level in 25 years).
2. Fifty-one percent of teachers report being under sig-
nificant stress at their jobs.
3. Three out of four principals regard their jobs as too
complex.
4. About a third of K-12 principals believe they will
likely enter a different profession in the next 5 years.
There may indeed be a problem regarding educators in
America. It appears, however, that the problem might be
what conditions do to educators rather than problems caused
by educators.
Amidst demands for greater accountability, many meth-
ods of ensuring teacher quality are suggested. One that is
currently gaining popularity in some quarters is value-added
assessment. In this system, statistical methods are applied to
determine which teachers are succeeding and which are fail-
ing in adding "value" to a child's achievement. The system
has been touted as fair and useful for comparing achievement
at the building and district levels, across states, and for eval-
uating the relative success of teacher education units at col-
leges and universities The idea is that such assessments
measure how much value is added to a child's educational
profile, regardless of whether a child is "on grade level" or
not (Alexander, 2008).
There are some problems with the scheme. The major
problem is that such systems cannot adequately assign value
to the various factors that influence student achievement. In
value-added paradigms, the major influence on student
achievement is what the teacher does. The approach assumes
that teachers must be threatened and cajoled into putting
forth the effort required to ensure student achievement. It
remains to be seen if poor teacher performance is wide-
spread. It also remains to be seen if the teacher's classroom
performance really is the main determiner of students' aca-
demic achievement, or just one of many factors; and perhaps
not the most important one.
Bausell (2013) expresses caution regarding value-added
evaluation. Although, value-added teacher evaluation is both
promoted and criticized, rarely is this approach examined
from a scientific perspective pursued without an agenda. The
4 SAGE Open
conventional wisdom is that "causal conclusions can be
teased out of huge data sets by economists or statisticians
using sophisticated statistical models that control for extra-
neous factors." Using a model of statistical design and analy-
sis normally associated with medical research, Bausell calls
that wisdom into question.
In such a model, subjects are "(a) premeasured on an out-
come, (b) randomly assigned to receive different treatments,
and (c) measured again to ascertain if changes in the out-
come differed based upon the treatments received." This
research paradigm is virtually impossible when it comes to
research on the effectiveness of value-added assessment in
improving student achievement.
The gold standard in medical research is random assign-
ment. For reasons known and unknown, schools cannot truly
randomly assign students to educational conditions. As
Bausell writes (2013), " . . . any student assigned to any
teacher can receive auxiliary tutoring, be helped at home,
team-taught, or subjected to any number of naturally occur-
ring positive or disruptive learning experiences." In short,
value-added systems simply cannot adequately control for
such factors. Many of these variables are not only unknown
but even unknowable.
As a transition into our discussion of the societal
approaches to understanding the "problem," it should be
noted that other factors that influence student achievement
and relate to the ways that teachers are evaluated have been
noted. Elsewhere, many factors influence student achieve-
ment. It is reported that 97% of students receiving A's and
B's on their report cards had parents who consistently
encouraged them to do well in school, while 49% of students
receiving C's received little such encouragement. While
about 50% of our proclivities are genetic in nature, the
remaining 50% seems to make a real difference. It is this
"half" of our personal cognitive profiles that are highly
amendable to parental influence (Alexander, 2011).
And parental encouragement isn't the only consideration.
Some have estimated that about 9% of variation in student
achievement is due to teacher characteristics. About 60% of
variation is explained by family characteristics, student char-
acteristics, and such variables. All direct school input com-
bined (teacher quality, classroom variables, etc.) seems to
account for about 21% of student outcomes (Goldhaber,
2002). To sum up, the narrowly educational view of the prob-
lem of student underachievement is, at best, suspect.
The Broadly Societal View
The alternative view of the "problem" looks to society in
general as the impetus for the creation of both good and ill in
the education of young people. This view is quite broad. It
incorporates such societal/environmental variables as vio-
lence, media, youth culture, and politics. Of course, educa-
tional factors are not excluded, since they fit into the societal
mix as well. However, those factors are only part of the
equation, and perhaps not the major component in student's
failure to achieve. In addition, as we have seen, the usual
approach to the educational "side of the ledger" is likely mis-
conceived. Perhaps a broadly societal perspective offers a
clearer view.
There are far too many factors in the societal mix to sort
them out here. For the purpose of this discussion, the focus
will be on three major influences that might affect children
and schools. The first, family considerations, has an obvious
effect on children both in and out of school. The second, pov-
erty, has long been identified as a predictor of academic dif-
ficulty. It is widely accepted that socioeconomic status (SES)
has a greater effect on student achievement than race, gender,
or age of students. The third consideration, technology, is (in
some ways) a rather new but major contender in affecting
children at school and at home as it may even affect thinking
processes. As society and schools in particular wholeheart-
edly embrace technology, it may be to our benefit or to detri-
ment, as is indicated below.
Families
Olsen and Fuller (2011) point out many ways that families
have changed over the years. Many of these trends are
patently obvious. There is a shift from two-parent families to
one-parent families. There are more grandparents raising
children. Modern families face problems of child abuse and
domestic violence. There is a precipitous increase in blended
families. Families are highly mobile and, depending on fac-
tors such as parental work skills and education level, there is
the very real specter of creating and furthering generational
poverty. It might be that parents are having less input into the
lives of their children. Finally, childrearing practices have
become more permissive and, in some cases, negligent.
Are all of these changes completely negative? While we
might be tempted to say that they likely are not, it is more
accurate to say that there is no definitive answer to the ques-
tion. For many, the general trend toward a more negative out-
come for families is a foregone conclusion. Yet, strong,
healthy families come in many shapes and forms. It does
seem certain, however, that many of the shifting trends bear
closer scrutiny.
In Michael Winerip's December 9, 2007 New York Times
article, "In the Gaps at School, Weighing Family Life," the
results of a study by the Educational Testing Service (ETS)
are discussed. If ETS has expertise at all, it must certainly
be in the field of assessment. ETS researchers examined
four variables: absenteeism, the percent of children living
in single-parent families, the amount of television watch-
ing, and how much preschoolers are read to daily by par-
ents. Using these factors, the researchers found they could
predict states' results on reading tests in eighth grade with
considerable accuracy. They determined that these four fac-
tors accounted for two thirds of the variance of results
between states.
Alexander 5
The report went on to say that by the time many kids start
school, they are already behind. A child from a single-parent
home is 2.5 times more likely to repeat a grade. By age 4, a
child from a professional family hears about 35 million more
words than his more disadvantaged counterpart.
All of this is significant and little of it is within the
school's, much less the teacher's, control. Add to this the fac-
tors of transience and limited English proficiency and it
becomes apparent that approaches such as value-added
assessment are far too crude to address something as com-
plex as student achievement and the "problem" with schools.
Schools deal with a very multivariate clientele. As we have
seen, approaches such as value-added assessment just cannot
address the variables (which are multiplying) that teachers
face every day. Embracing such heavy-handed approaches to
student achievement is overly simplistic. It is a bit like using
a sledgehammer as a fly swatter. Many of the solutions pro-
posed to deal with the problems associated with schools are
just not sensitive enough to the variables of the real world,
which inevitably involve family life and structure.
Poverty
Ruby Payne (2005) enumerates some of the characteristics of
generational poverty in the United States. These characteris-
tics include
1. Background noise--The T.V. is almost always on.
2. Little room for academics--Discussions tend to
avoid academic topics.
3. Expectations for men--Men are expected to be "real
men" not "eggheads."
4. Negative orientation--The orientation in stories and
outlook is generally negative.
5. Polarized thinking--Thinking tends to be absolute.
Statements such as "I can't do it" are common.
6. Lack of future orientation--There is little real plan-
ning for the improvement of conditions in the future.
7. Lack of organization--Homes are often unkempt and
disorganized.
8. Distrust of educational institutions--There is a dis-
trust of schools, and children often have a negative
view of school.
Certainly, all, some, or none of these characteristics may
be obvious in the history of any given child. Some of these
characteristics are obviously influential when it comes to
children and schooling. Some characteristics may have indi-
rect effects. Some may not impact learning in any measur-
able way (at least in many cases). What is quite apparent is
that poverty impacts kids. In addition, the number of children
living in poverty is on the rise. Poverty, as part of the constel-
lation of factors comprising the concept of socioeconomic
status, has long been noted to impact student learning
(Snowman & McCown, 2013). It is quite safe to say that the
impact of poverty is well established and there is little doubt
that schools with large populations of underprivileged chil-
dren tend to perform poorly on most measures of achieve-
ment relative to schools with wealthier populations.
There is a mistaken idea that the problems of the poor
could be solved if only they worked, or at least worked
harder. I sometimes have my classes engage in an activity to
investigate that notion. I present my students with a scenario
in which a single mother with two children works 30 hours a
week for minimum wage. Then we look at expenses such as
food, transportation, clothing, and medical care. When
viewed in this light, the causes of discouragement are quite
apparent.
As stated above, the impact of poverty on children in
schools is well known. Yet, the political climate as it stands
in the United States hardly favors new expenditures to help
alleviate poverty. Certainly, a comprehensive societal
approach to dealing with the concerns related to education
must address poverty.
Technology
Any discussion of the impact of technology on society in
general and children in particular needs to begin with the
reality that it is not going away. Cris Rowan (2013) raises the
question of whether technology is interfering with the devel-
opment of children. Technology impacts children socially,
cognitively, and physically. Children interact with others dif-
ferently when technology pervades their lives. In fact, they
may interact less. They think in different ways in and out of
a heavily technology "saturated" environment. Certainly,
hours of technology use impacts physical development.
When it comes to children and learning, technology is pow-
erful. And when it comes to culture and society, technology
is ubiquitous. Still, adopting a Luddite position about the
issue simply won't do. At least not anymore. Technology
impacts society, and therefore children. This is apparent to
the most casual observers. The question of rather the adop-
tion of technology should proceed uncritically is a question
of a different order. It bears asking.
No matter what one's political inclination might be, it is
beneficial to read Al Gore's insightful book, The Future
(Gore, 2013), dealing with current and future societal trends.
In particular, Gore reviews the place of technology in the lives
of world citizens. Gore points out that the upcoming revision
(as of this writing) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders will include a note about "Internet Use
Disorder" as being worthy of further study. It is clear that
Gore sees the Internet as influencing society and persons. The
amount of time spent online may well be changing our con-
sciousness. Humanity evolved literacy over the millennia.
Yet, it is possible, as Gore indicates, that our basic neurologi-
cal structure might be shifting, due largely to technology. The
print revolution that accompanied the growth of literacy
seems to be rapidly overshadowed by the digital revolution.
6 SAGE Open
The influence of technology is ubiquitous. Gore tells of
how 40% of smartphone owners connect to the Internet upon
awakening. By 2015, there will be as many mobile Internet
devices as there are people on the planet. Much of what Gore
writes about deals with the idea that "we make our tools, and
then our tools make us." Still, he states that technology does
not change human nature. I would argue that technology
does interact with our humanness to create new facets of cul-
ture and societal influence.
Turkle (2011) writes of how technology has the potential
to isolate individuals and undermine community. It seems
counterintuitive. It seems as if digital connectivity would
only serve to broaden our relationships and deepen our sense
of community. Some years ago, I attended a Peter, Paul, and
Mary concert where they commented on how we are never
so alone as when we are "connected." As Turkle indicates,
real relationships often suffer in the face of increasing
embrace of technology. It is unclear how the supplanting of
"face to face" relationships with digital connections might
affect children.
There is some evidence that the Internet is making us more
"shallow." Technology can tend toward superficiality. Some
commentators (see Carr, 2010, for example) urge caution in
the embrace of technology. These critics view technology as
a potential impetus in "dumbing us down." While society in
general and schools in particular seem eager to embrace tech-
nology, the verdict is not yet fully in on the impact on society,
culture, or schools. As Moore's Law suggests, the growth of
technology proceeds in an ever-accelerating pace. Could it be
that the rapid pace with which society embraces technology is
outpacing the accumulation of data relative to the impact of
that embrace?
Although there are many implications of the rise in tech-
nology in our society, and these all affect the ways that chil-
dren and adults relate to the world, to school, to work, and to
each other, some aspects of technology do seem to have a
rather direct impact on children and schooling. For years,
some voices in the field of learning and cognitive psychol-
ogy have urged caution in how children utilize technology.
Carr (2010) sounds a cautionary note concerned with the
effect of technology on attention spans and thinking pro-
cesses in general. Furthermore, some researchers state that
the effectiveness of teaching with a large component of tech-
nology has not been demonstrated to outperform more con-
ventional approaches (see Alexander, 2012).
What is clear is that, whether in school or out of school,
technology is here to stay. It is ubiquitous. In a positive
appraisal of technology in society and biology, Kurzweil
(2005) describes how the growth of technology, both in
terms of computing power as well as prevalence, is exponen-
tial. Although some may have concerns, and although some
legitimate cautionary notes might be voiced, the "genie can-
not be put back in the bottle." Nor should we wish to gener-
ally reverse the trends that have led to advancements in
technology applications. This does not mean, however, that
society's embrace of technology should be unexamined or
unequivocal.
Final Thoughts
Although it is not my purpose here to offer specific solu-
tions to curricular and pedagogical concerns, there are many
ideas which have promise, and which should be imple-
mented. Reorganization of schools to implement ideas such
as competency-based education (Kentucky Department of
Education, 2013) might certainly help compensate for envi-
ronmental and societal factors which hinder student learn-
ing. However, even with this being the case, the main
problem is not specifically "educational" nor can it be ade-
quately addressed by changes in the way that schooling is
delivered. The problem lies much deeper, and superficial
fixes are unlikely to succeed.
This, then, is my diagnosis of the "problem." As stated at
the outset, it is not my intention to offer a solution here. I feel
a bit like a physician that has only partial training. It seems
that I can diagnose, but I cannot say how to cure the disease.
Since poverty, technological impact, the nature of fami-
lies, and other such contemporary concerns are very human,
societal factors, the answer seems to call for very human
solutions. Perhaps the demise of education, if such a demise
exists, is not so much due to pedagogical and curricular fac-
tors. Perhaps the demise of education is, in reality, an eclipse
of compassion.
This article has contrasted two views dealing with the
problem of student underachievement: the narrowly educa-
tional view and the broadly societal view. It is suggested that
the broadly societal view more aptly frames the problem.
This view may well suggest solutions as well. Societies can
change directions. If the civil rights movement of the 1960s
proves anything, it proves this. Throughout history, societal
concerns have lead to paradigm shifts. Perhaps it is time for
a civil discussion once again. It is reasonable to assume that
society and societal changes impact schools and children.
The task of social science analysis is to "tease out" the ways
that the educational endeavor is diminished. Then, seeing
more clearly, society can better determine which societal
shifts or changes should be embraced, when caution is war-
ranted, and when change should be resisted. Caring for chil-
dren and supporting teachers is a far better way forward than
accusing and punishing.
