Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the root and root canal morphology of the maxillary second molars
(MSMs) in a native Chinese population by cone-beam computed tomography.
Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography images of 2412 MSMs from 1294 Chinese patients
were analyzed to determine the number and morphology of the roots, the root canal morphology,
the bilateral symmetry, and the correlations of these parameters with sex and age.
Results: The percentage of fused roots increased with age, while the percentage of fused roots in
women was higher than that in men. The percentage of second mesiobuccal (MB2) canals in MSMs
with three separate roots was higher in men than women. Patients aged 31 to 40 years showed a
higher prevalence of MB2 canals, while those aged !51 years showed the lowest prevalence of
MB2 canals among both men and women. There was a significant difference in bilateral symmetry
of MSMs between men and women.
Conclusion: Root fusion of MSMs increased with age, while the root canal morphology was more
complex in patients of intermediate ages.

Introduction
A thorough anatomical knowledge of the
roots and root canals is an essential pre-
requisite for successful root canal treat-
ment.1 Since Hess and Zurcher
demonstrated the anatomic complexities of
the root canal system, many studies have
revealed that the root canal system has
complex anatomical characteristics such as
main and accessory canals, multiple fora-
mina, isthmuses between canals, and irregu-
larly shaped canals. More importantly,
many studies have described different
trends in the number and morphology of
roots and root canals among different
ethnicities, between the two sexes,2 and
among different ages.3­6
The maxillary second molars (MSMs)
have been frequently investigated because
of their complex root and root canal morph-
ology and higher incidence of variations.
Most MSMs exhibit a mesiobuccal root
(MBR), a distobuccal root (DBR), and a
palatal root (PR).7 A common anatomic
variation in these teeth is root fusion, with a
prevalence of 5.90% to 42.25%.4,8­13 Yang
et al.8 indicated that the prevalence of root
fusion of MSMs in a Chinese population in
Taiwan was 40.1%. Fusion of the PR with
the MBR was the most prevalent, followed
by fusion of the MBR with the DBR;
complete fusion of the three roots into a
cone-shaped root was the least common.
Other studies of the native Chinese popula-
tion have revealed that fusion of the two
buccal roots (BRs) of MSMs was the most
prevalent type of fusion.9­11 Silva et al.12
reported that the prevalence of MSMs with
three separate roots in a Brazilian popula-
tion was 79.41%, while the most common
anatomic variation was a mesial root (MR)
and a distal root (DR) with one canal in the
MR and two canals in the DR. Plotino
et al.13 found that a BR and PR was the
most common anatomic variation in the
MSMs in a white population. Kim et al.4
found that the incidence of fused roots was
10.71% in MSMs in a Korean population,
and four separate roots were identified in
four (0.49%) of the MSMs, including three
BRs and one PR, two DBRs, one MBR, and
one PR. In addition, Kottoor et al.14
reported an MSM of a 35-year-old man
exhibiting two PRs, two MBRs, and one
DBR each with its own separate canal. Zeng
et al.15 treated a right MSM exhibiting a C-
shaped MBR with two canals, two fused
DBRs with two separate canals, and one
normal bulky PR with one canal.
Many methods have been used to evalu-
ate the root canal morphology. The most
commonly used methods include canal
staining and tooth clearing,2,16 periapical
radiographs,17 and micro-computed tomog-
raphy (micro-CT).9 The canal staining and
tooth clearing technique has generally been
considered the gold standard in previous
studies.2,16 However, this technique cannot
be used in vivo, and it is not repeatable
because of its destruction to teeth. Periapical
radiographs have generally been used in
clinical examinations, but the defects of
anatomical noise, two-dimensionality, and
geometric distortion have restricted its
application in investigations.18,19 Micro-CT
imaging has been applied to evaluate the
root and root canal anatomy because of its
high resolution and lack of specimen
destruction.9 However, micro-CT cannot
be used to scan the head of a living
human, which limits its clinic application.
Recently, cone-beam computed tomography
(CBCT) has been widely used in endodontic
Wu et al. 831
regions because it provides improved accur-
acy, higher resolution, and lower effective
radiation doses than does conventional
CT.20 CBCT images can display the axial,
sagittal, and coronal planes of the roots and
root canals, reducing the superimposition of
surrounding structures.21 Studies have con-
firmed that CBCT images are as accurate as
the modified staining technique in identify-
ing the root canal system and much more
accurate than periapical radiographs.22
CBCT as a nondestructive scanning tech-
nique has become a powerful tool in endo-
dontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and
follow-up.23
Previous studies have reported the
number of root canals of MSMs in native
Chinese populations9­11,15; however, few
studies have explicitly investigated the mor-
phological characteristics of the MSMs
according to the sex and age of the patients.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to
investigate the root and root canal morph-
ology of MSMs in a large sample of a native
Chinese population according to sex and age
using CBCT images.
Patients and methods
Patients
This study was approved by the Ethical
Committee Department, Affiliated Hospital
of Stomatology, Nanjing Medical
University (PJ2014-031-001), and written
informed consent was obtained from the
patients. High-quality CBCT images were
randomly collected from the Department of
Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of
Stomatology, Nanjing Medical University
from July 2014 to December 2015. The
reasons for CBCT scanning included man-
agement of impacted teeth before orthodon-
tic treatment, preoperative assessment for
dental implants, treatment planning before
nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treat-
ment, and diagnosis of facial trauma. The
CBCT images fulfilled the following inclu-
sion criteria: the presence of MSMs; MSMs
with fully formed apices; and no root canal
fillings, posts, coronal restorations, frac-
tures, root resorption, apical periodontitis,
or any other odontogenic or nonodonto-
genic pathology.
CBCT images of 2412 MSMs of 560 men
and 734 women were selected. The details of
the selected specimens are shown in Table 1.
The mean age of the men and women was
39.5 Æ 14.4 (range, 20­78) years and 36.8 Æ
13.9 (range, 20­75) years, respectively.
Image acquisitions and evaluations
CBCT images were obtained using a CBCT
device (NewTom 5G; QR s.r.l., Verona,
Italy) with the following parameters: 110
kVp and 10 mA, a basic voxel size of
0.16 mm, and scanning time of 18 s. The
field of view (8 Â 12 cm or 18 Â 16 cm) was
selected according to the examination
requirements. The as-low-as-reasonably-
achievable principle was strictly followed,
exposing patients to the least amount of

radiation while still obtaining the most
useful information for a proper diagnosis.
All images were acquired by an experienced
radiologist according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Two endodontists were calibrated based
on the criteria and variants established
before the experimental reading. The inter-
examiner and intraexaminer reliability were
assessed by statistical analysis using Cohen's
kappa. The endodontists then simultan-
eously evaluated the CBCT images with
NNT software version 4.6 (ImageWorks,
Elmsford, NY). All MSMs were analyzed
using serial axial, sagittal, and coronal
planes with a slice thickness of 0.3 mm, and
the contrast and brightness of the images
could be adjusted using the software to
ensure optimal visualization. After 2
weeks, the two endodontists evaluated the
CBCT images again, and a radiologist with
endodontic experience resolved any dis-
agreements. The following observations
were recorded:
(1) Number and morphology of roots
The number and morphology of roots
were classified into the following categories,
modified from the method described by
Yang et al.8:
Category I: One root
Subdivision 1: Cone-shaped root
Subdivision 2: B-shaped root
Subdivision 3: V-shaped root
Category II: Two roots
Subdivision 1: BR (MBR fused with
DBR) þ PR
Subdivision 2: MR (MBR fused with
PR) þ DBR
Subdivision 3: MBR þ DR (DBR fused
with PR)
Category III: Three roots: MBR þ DBR þ
PR
Category IV: Four roots: MBR þ DBR þ
mesiopalatal root þ distopalatal root
(2) Root canal morphology
The root canal morphology of every
root of the MSMs was analyzed
according to Vertucci' s classification.1 The
incidence of additional canals was also
determined.
(3) Symmetry of MSMs
The symmetry in the root and the root
canal morphology of the MSMs on the
opposite side were evaluated.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) at a
significance level of P < 0.05. The associ-
ation between the root/canal morphology
and the patient's sex and age was assessed
using the chi-square test and the Kruskal­
Wallis test.
Results
The kappa values for interexaminer agree-
ment were 0.9017 and 0.8665 for the first and
second assessments, respectively. The kappa
value for the intraexaminer agreement of
each examiner was 0.9684. These values
indicated good interexaminer and intraex-
aminer agreement.
Number and morphology of roots
The CBCT axial and three-dimensional
images of the root morphology of the
MSMs are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The
distribution of the root morphology accord-
ing to patient age and sex is shown in
Table 2.
Of the men, 702 (68.09%) MSMs had
separate roots (695 three-rooted and 7 four-
rooted MSMs), and 329 (31.91%) had fused
roots (129 one-rooted and 200 two-rooted
MSMs). Of the women, 712 (51.56%)
MSMs had separate roots (700 three-
rooted and 12 four-rooted MSMs), and 669

(48.44%) had fused roots (299 one-rooted
and 370 two-rooted MSMs). The percentage
of fused roots increased with age in both men
and women, while the percentage of fused
roots was higher in women than men in each
age group (P < 0.05). The Kruskal­Wallis
test showed significant associations between
the percentage of fused roots and sex
(P < 0.05).
For one-rooted MSMs, a cone-shaped
root was the most prevalent while a B-
shaped root was the least prevalent in both
men and women. For two-rooted MSMs,
Subdivision 1 roots were the most prevalent
in men, while Subdivision 2 roots were the
most prevalent in women. Subdivision 3
roots were the least prevalent in both men
and women.
Number and morphology of root canals
The root canal morphology of one-rooted
MSMs included Vertucci's Type I, II, IV, V,
and VIII (Figure 3a and b) and five add-
itional canal types identified as follows: 1-2-
3, 3-1, 3-2, 3-2-1, and 2-3 (Tables 3 and 4).
For two-rooted MSMs, all nonfused
roots had Vertucci's Type I canals, whereas
the fused roots showed complex root canal
morphologies. For Subdivision 1, the BRs
had Vertucci's Type I, II, III, IV, V, VIII,
and 3-2 type. Type IV canals were the most
common in men, while Type I canals were
the most common in women. For
Subdivisions 2 and 3, most of the fused
roots had Type IV canals in both men and
women (Figure 3c, Tables 3 and 4).

For three-rooted MSMs, all DR and PR
canals were Vertucci's Type I. The percent-
ages of second mesiobuccal (MB2) canals in
the MBR was significantly higher in men
than women in every age group except the
!51-year group (Table 5, Figure 3d). The
31- to 40-year age group showed a higher
prevalence of MB2 canals than the other age
groups (P < 0.05), while MB2 canals were
more frequently absent in the !51-year
group in both men and women (P < 0.05).
For four-rooted MSMs, each of the four
roots had only one canal.
Symmetry in the bilateral MSMs
Of 471 men and 654 women with both
bilateral MSMs, 311 men and 382 women
had perfect symmetry in the root and root
canal morphology on the opposite side. Men
had higher symmetry than women (P < 0.05)
(Table 6). Among men, the 31- to 40-year
and 41- to 50-year age groups had lower
symmetry than the other age groups
(P < 0.05), while in women, there were no
significant differences among the age groups
(Table 6).
Discussion
Many studies have revealed that the pres-
ence of three separate roots is the most
common morphology in MSMs (incidence
of 66.10%­94.60%), while four-rooted
MSMs are very rare (incidence of 0.06%­
1.20%).4,10,11 The results of the present
study revealed that 67.41% and 50.69% of
MSMs had three separate roots and that
0.68% and 0.87% of MSMs had four sep-
arate roots in men and women, respectively.
The prevalence of root fusion in women
(48.44%) was significantly higher than that
in men (31.91%), and the percentage of
fused roots increased with age in both men
and women. Additionally, the form of root
fusion was not the same between men and
women. Possible explanations for these
observations are that (1) the cementum
deposition with time differs between men
and women, resulting in different forms and
prevalences of root fusion, and (2) the
cementum deposition with time is not uni-
form in people of the same sex and peaks in
old age, resulting in a complex and change-
ful root morphology in old age.
The incidence of MB2 canals in MSMs
varies from 13.87% to 78.90%.10,11,24 Zhang
et al.10 reported that MB2 canals were present
in 18% of the MSMs in a Chinese popula-
tion, and Weng et al.24 reported that MB2
canals were present in 14% in the MSMs in
subjects of Han ethnicity in the same Chinese
population. In the present study, the preva-
lences of MB2 canals in three-rooted MSMs
in men and women were 33.67% and 26.14%,
respectively. The prevalence of MB2 canals
was significantly different between men and
women (P < 0.05). Men in the 31- to 40-year
age group showed the highest prevalence of
MB2 canals, but both men and women in the
!51-year age groups showed the lowest

prevalence of MB2 canals. These results are
consistent with previous reports in Korean4
and Brazilian5 populations, in which the
prevalence of MB2 canals was found to be
associated with patient age. The present
results are also consistent with a previous
report in a Japan population, which con-
firmed that canal differentiation was com-
pleted around 30 to 40 years of age for the
deposition of secondary dentin, resulting in a
low prevalence of intercanal communications
at young and old ages but a high prevalence
at intermediate ages.3 These results confirm
the above-mentioned possible explanations
for why the deposition of secondary dentin
with time differs between men and women
and is not uniform in people of the same sex.
In general, the root canal morphology of
MSMs changes as age advances, but it
becomes more complex at intermediate ages.
Bilateral symmetry of the presence or
absence of MB2 canals of MSMs was found
in 82.07% of a Korean population.4 Zhang
et al.10 and Tian et al.11 reported that bilat-
eral homonymous MSMs were present in
84.0% and 82.3% of people in a Chinese
population, respectively. In addition, Plotino
et al.13 observed symmetry in 79.6% of white
patients. In the present study, bilateral sym-
metry of the MSM root and root canal
morphology was found in 66.03% of men
and 59.22% of women, and the main pattern
of asymmetry was the presence of a single
canal in each root of three-rooted MSMs.
The highest symmetry was found in the 20- to
30-year age group, and lower bilateral sym-
metry was found in the 31- to 40-year and 41-
to 50-year age groups; this may have been
caused by the simple root canal morphology
at young ages and complicated morphology
at intermediate ages.
This study has provided a detailed
description of the root and canal morphol-
ogies of MSMs in a large sample of a
Chinese population. These findings are
very important for clinicians because they
will help to increase the success rates for
endodontic treatment of patients of different
sexes and ages. However, accessory canals
may not be readily identified because of the
resolution of CBCT. In addition, the higher
radiation and higher cost of CBCT scanning
compared with periapical radiography
hinder its clinical application, especially for
endodontic treatment.
Conclusions
The root and root canal morphology of
MSMs in a Chinese population showed asso-
ciations with sex and age. Root fusion was
increased with age, while root canal morph-
ology was more complex at intermediate ages.
