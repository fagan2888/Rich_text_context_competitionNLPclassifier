RISK-ASSESSMENT IMPLICATIONS OF MECHANISTIC MODEL'S
PREDICTION OF LOW-DOSE NONLINEARITY OF LIVER TUMOR RISK
FOR MICE FED FUMONISIN B1

Assessment, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, Jefferson, Arkansas
 A two-stage, clonal-expansion model of liver tumor risk in mice was developed by Kodell et al.
(Food Addit Contam 18:237­253, 2001) based on the hypothesis that fumonisin B1, a naturally
occurring mycotoxin in corn, is not genotoxic, but rather causes cancer through the disruption of
sphingolipid metabolism. This disruption is assumed to cause an increase in apoptosis, in response to
which cells proliferate to compensate for reduced tissue mass. The resulting differential increase in the
number of pre-neoplastic cells at risk of mutation during cell division is assumed to lead to an increase
in the incidence of tumors. Two-year liver tumor incidences predicted by the model using data on organ
weight, cell proliferation, and sphingolipid metabolism provided a reasonable match to the actual
2-year observed incidences in a study conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Research.
The predictions indicated no risk at low doses (even a possible hormetic effect) and high risk at high
doses in females, as well as a complete absence of a dose response (or perhaps, a hormetic effect) in
males. This paper provides a commentary on the risk-assessment implications of the modeling results,
pointing out that the model's low-dose predictions provide scientific support and justification for the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's low-ppm guidance levels in corn products. These guidance
levels are significantly higher than would be obtained using linear extrapolation, the method most
often used for genotoxic carcinogens and other carcinogens for which low-dose linearity cannot be
ruled out.

INTRODUCTION
Fumonisin B1 is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by various
Fusarium species of molds. It is found in corn and corn-based food products
consumed by humans and in animal feeds (Dutton, 1996). Fumonisin B1 is
highly toxic to horses (Kellerman et al., 1990) and pigs (Haschek et al., 1992),
is carcinogenic in rodents (Gelderblom et al., 1992), and may be linked to
esophageal cancer in humans (Marasas et al., 1988). A 2-year bioassay with
rats and mice was conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Re-
search under the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1999) to characterize
the risk of toxicity and carcinogenicity from consumption of food containing

fumonisin B1. To enable the investigation of toxic mechanisms, the bioassay
included ancillary studies of cell proliferation and apoptosis and of sphin-
golipid metabolism in the two target organs, liver and kidney. These ancil-
lary studies were prompted by the presumed carcinogenic mechanism in
rodents, that is, the promotion of initiated cells to tumors through continual
induction of apoptosis and subsequent cellular regeneration (NTP, 1999).
This nongenotoxic mechanism is believed to begin with the interruption of
sphingolipid synthesis in cells due to the inhibition of ceramide synthase by
fumonisin B1 (Riley et al., 1998). The resulting increased intracellular levels
of sphinganine are associated with increased apoptosis (Tolleson et al., 1996;
Yoo et al., 1996; Delongchamp and Young, 2001). It is hypothesized that com-
pensatory proliferation of cells in response to increased apoptosis puts more
cells at risk of mutation to malignancy, hence increasing the risk of cancer.
The nongenotoxic mechanism of carcinogenic action for fumonisin B1
has fairly strong support among scientists engaged in assessing the toxicity
and carcinogenicity of fumonisins (Cohen et al., 2000). For this reason, the
present authors and their colleagues previously adopted that mechanism in
developing a mechanistic mathematical model to predict the risk of liver tu-
mors in the mice that were exposed through diet to fumonisin B1 in the NTP
study (Kodell et al., 2001). As was noted in the 2001 World Health Organiza-
tion document on the safety evaluation of mycotoxins in food (WHO, 2001),
the model was able to produce reasonably well the observed tumor rates in
both female and male mice, predicting substantially increased rates above
background only in females at the highest doses of fumonisin B1.
This paper will briefly review the modeling that was done by Kodell et al.
(2001) to point out key characteristics of the model's representation of the
hypothesized nongenotoxic mechanism for liver cancer. The reader will need
to refer to Kodell et al. (2001) for complete details. The degree to which the
low-dose nonlinearity of the model was reflective of the observed lower-than-
background liver tumor proportions at low doses will be discussed in the
context of possible hormesis. The relatively high fumonisin guidance levels
set by the FDA (2001), which are supported by the low-dose nonlinearity
of the mechanistic model, will be contrasted with the much lower guidance
levels that would have resulted had linear extrapolation been employed to
derive such exposure levels.
MECHANISTIC MODEL AND RESULTS
Key Characteristics of the Model
Kodell et al. (2001) implemented a two-stage, clonal-expansion model
of liver tumor risk in mice based on the hypothesis that fumonisin B1 causes
cancer through the disruption of sphingolipid metabolism, which leads to an
increase in apoptosis, in response to which cells proliferate to compensate for

FIGURE 1 Schema of the two-stage, clonal-expansion model of carcinogenesis implemented by Kodell
et al. (2001) for fumonisin B1 risk prediction: N(t) is the number of normal liver cells at time t,
N (t) and P(t) are birth rates of normal and preneoplastic cells, N (t) and P(t) are death rates of
normal and preneoplastic cells, and µ1 and µ2 are mutation rates of normal and preneoplastic cells,
respectively.
reduced tissue mass. A schematic diagram of the model is given in Figure 1.
It is especially noteworthy that if the assumed apoptotic effect of fumonisin
B1 was modeled on both normal cells and pre-neoplastic cells (i.e., through
both N (t) and P(t) in Figure 1), then inadequate predictions of liver tumor
risk were obtained. When the apoptotic effect of fumonisin B1 was assumed
to act only on the pre-neoplastic cells (i.e., only on P(t) in Figure 1) the pre-
dictions of tumor risk matched the observed tumor proportions reasonably
well. This is consistent with observations using other stimulators of apopto-
sis in liver (e.g., caloric restriction) that cells with markers for pre-neoplasia
are more sensitive to the stimulus than are normal cells (Muskhelishvili et al.,
1996). Hence, it is the differential increase in the number of pre-neoplastic cells at
risk of mutation during cell division, due to the increase in P(t) in Figure 1
to compensate for the increase in P(t), that leads to the predicted increase
in the incidence of tumors. In Figures 2 and 3, predictions of the 2-year liver
tumor incidences by the model developed from the aforementioned mecha-
nistic data are overlaid with the actual 2-year observed incidences (Figure 2:
female mice; Figure 3: male mice). The predictions are in line with the tumor
data, indicating no risk for females at low doses and high risk at high doses
(with a possible hormetic effect), as well as the absence of a dose response
for males (with perhaps a hormetic effect there, also).
Is the Nonlinearity Evidence of Hormesis?
The 2-year unadjusted liver tumor proportions (hepatocellular adeno-
mas and carcinomas combined) observed in females at 0, 5, and 15 ppm
were 5/47, 3/48, and 1/48, respectively. Corresponding tumor proportions
in males were 12/47, 9/47, and 9/48. The fact that the 5-ppm tumor rate
was below the 0-ppm rate and the 15-ppm rate was below the 5-ppm rate
in both sexes suggests the strong possibility of a hormetic effect. The only
statistically significant "reduction" in tumors below the background rate oc-
curred at 15 ppm in females, where a one-sided chi-squared test at the 5%

level indicated a significant difference between the 0- and 15-ppm tumor
rates (p < 0.044). (With Fisher's exact test, however, this difference was not
statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.097)).
For estimating risk at the experimental doses of fumonisin B1, survival-
adjusted rates (NTP, 1999) rather than raw observed tumor rates were used,
but there was little difference between the unadjusted and adjusted rates
because of comparable survival rates in the low-dose groups. Although the
model does predict slightly less-than-background risk at 5 ppm in females
and 15 ppm in males, it does not reproduce the full degree of reduction
in tumor rates below the background rate that is actually observed at both
5 and 15 ppm in both sexes. The model's prediction of slightly less-than-
background risk in female mice at 5 ppm (Figure 2) coincides with a slightly
lower average level of sphinganine in the liver at that dose (Kodell et al., 2001).
However, at 15 ppm the average tissue level of sphinganine was higher than
that at 0 ppm. In fact, the tissue sphinganine data showed a high degree of

variability (Kodell et al., 2001: Figure 10), with average liver concentrations
in females of 2.3 ± 0.9 (standard error), 1.7 ± 0.4, 3.2 ± 0.9, 5.1 ± 2.0, and
5.2 ± 2.5 nmol/g at 0, 5, 15, 50, and 80 ppm, respectively. Hence, it is not
possible with these data to argue that tumor risk will be below background
whenever tissue sphinganine is below that of controls and vice versa. An alter-
native explanation of the low-dose nonlinearity might be that the effect on
cell death has a "threshold" for tissue regeneration. That is, it could be that
at very low doses the effect of increased apoptosis actually reduces the risk
of cancer because of the reduced population of pre-neoplastic cells and that
only after a certain level of apoptosis is reached is compensatory cell prolifera-
tion triggered. However, the estimated rates of apoptosis and proliferation at
0, 5, and 15 ppm were virtually indistinguishable (Kodell et al., 2001: Figures 8
and 9).
With the present model and data, it is not possible to resolve whether the
apparent hormetic effect reflected in the observed liver tumor proportions
at low doses is real. However, the mechanistically derived model is decidedly
nonlinear at low doses and gives strong evidence against low-dose linearity
40 R. L. Kodell and A. Turturro
(Figures 2 and 3). This has important implications for risk assessment and
for the setting of acceptable exposures.
Implications for Risk/Safety Assessment
The FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and its Center
for Veterinary Medicine recently published guidance levels for industry to
control total fumonisins (fumonisins B1, B2, and B3) in various corn-based
human food products and animal feeds (FDA, 2001). These (nonbinding)
guidance levels represent maximum total fumonisin levels that the FDA con-
siders adequate to protect human and animal health and that are achievable
in human foods and animal feeds with the use of good agricultural and good
manufacturing practices. For example, the concentration of total fumon-
isins in degermed dry-milled corn products (e.g., flaking grits, corn grits,
corn meal) should not exceed 2 ppm. For cleaned corn intended for pop-
corn, the guidance level is 3 ppm. In animal feeds intended for poultry being
raised for slaughter, the maximum concentration of total fumonisins should
not exceed 100 ppm (no more than 50% of diet), whereas for horses and
most pet animals the guidance level is 10 ppm (no more than 50% of diet).
It is noteworthy how close the guidance levels for human foods are to the
experimental doses of the NTP rodent study. It is quite unusual for regulatory
agencies to set levels this high relative to experimental levels. In the regu-
lation of chemicals, often the absence of sufficient information to rule out
low-dose linearity leads to much lower allowable levels that are determined
by linear extrapolation from the experimental dose range down to doses ex-
pected to correspond to negligible public health risks (e.g., 10-4 to 10-6).
The mathematical model's prediction of no increase in risk at low doses in
mice based on a generally accepted nongenotoxic cancer mechanism for
fumonisin B1 provides strong support for the FDA's deviation from linear
extrapolation in its comprehensive safety assessment to set guidance levels
for fumonisins.
To gain additional perspective, suppose that linear extrapolation via the
multistage model had been used to determine acceptable exposure levels. Al-
though the data for female mice are decidedly nonlinear (actually U-shaped),
a multistage model can be fitted that is not rejected by a goodness-of-fit test
(Figure 4). Figure 5 shows the background-subtracted best-fitting multistage
model and the (linear) upper 95% confidence limit on excess (added) risk
above background in the extreme low-dose region. Note that the upper con-
fidence limit on excess risk at 5 ppm, the lowest dose in the mouse studies, is
10-2, which is several orders of magnitude above what most regulatory agen-
cies consider acceptable public health risk. To assure an excess risk of no
more than 10-6 (in mice, at least) would dictate a dose level of 0.0005 ppm
(500 ppt; Figure 5). This suggests that much lower guidance levels than those
actually set by the FDA might have resulted had there not been a generally

accepted nongenotoxic mechanism for fumonisin B1 with mechanistic data
to support it.
DISCUSSION
The availability of mechanistic data on the purported nongenotoxic
mechanism of carcinogenic action of fumonisin B1 provided an opportunity
to develop a mathematical dose-response model (Kodell et al., 2001) whose
low-dose predicted tumor risks in mice could be compared to the nonlinear
(less-than-background) tumor rates actually observed in the experimental
animals (NTP, 1999). Although the model was developed primarily from an-
cillary mechanistic data, the predictions matched the observed tumor data
reasonably well, indicating no increased risk of liver tumors at low doses in
females and significantly increased risk at high doses. The model's success-
ful predictions of tumor risk in female mice were validated by its prediction
of no increased risk in males throughout the whole experimental range, in
agreement with the observed data.

excess risk at low doses.
Although the mechanistic data and model are not strong enough to
demonstrate conclusively a hormetic effect in the tumor response at low doses
as suggested by the 2-year tumor proportions, they are sufficiently strong to
rule out low-dose linearity, which has immediate consequences for regulat-
ing exposures to fumonisin B1. In this regard, the model's results provide
scientific support and justification for the FDA's low-ppm guidance levels in
corn products for both humans and animals (FDA, 2001). Those levels are
significantly higher than would be obtained using linear extrapolation, the
method most often used to regulate purported genotoxic carcinogens and
other carcinogens for which low-dose linearity cannot be ruled out.
In its characterization of fumonisin B1's dose-response relationship for
cancer, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives included
an extensive discussion of the implementation by Kodell et al. (2001) of
the mechanistic model in mice (WHO, 2001: pp. 198­203) while also re-
lying heavily on the observed threshold-like kidney tumor response in the
experimental rats from the same NTP study. The case of fumonisin B1 pro-
vides an example of the impact that credible data and models relevant to a
hypothesized mechanism of action can have on exposure levels that are set
by public health agencies.
