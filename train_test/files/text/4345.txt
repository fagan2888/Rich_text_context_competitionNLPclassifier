Introduction
The main paradigm of this article states the indivisible link
between civic education and intercultural education. Civic
education without intercultural education risks to ignore an
important part of society, to simplify the reality, and fails to
address issues related to the specificities of various groups, as
well as the challenges and opportunities of diversity.
Intercultural education without civic education may run into
two biases: either the approach in which diversity has to be
"dealt with" or the approach in which the intercultural aspects
are taken into account, but only on the surface, without in-
depth analysis of social and political context and without sig-
nificantcontributiontosocialtransformation.Thisperspective
demands us first of all to recognize that reality is plural, com-
plex, and dynamic, and that interaction is an integral part of
all lives and cultures. It leads to ensuring mutual respect and
development of communities that support each other and to
eliminating relationships based on domination and rejection.
In the words of Peter Lauritzen, it sounds like this:
He who reduces political language to difference only will come
out as an individualist and social Darwinist, he who does the
same with regard to equality will end up as collectivist. It is only
by keeping the concepts of difference and equality in balance
that one can speak of a fair and just society. (Ohana &
Rothemund, 2008, p. 138)
Diversity is not a new phenomenon, but the perspectives
on diversity, the interpretations, and practices in this area
represent a continuous challenge. Diversity as a concept is
widely used in daily life and political discourses. The current
perspective on diversity shifted from celebration, apprecia-
tion, or management of diversity to inclusion and develop-
ment of an intercultural society. This perspective moves
beyond celebration of diversity and organization of "folk-
loric events" to the creation of sustainable frameworks for
affirming cultural identity in all aspects of life, as well as
equal opportunities for personal development and contribu-
tion to the society in its entirety.
There is still a widespread tendency to use culture in polit-
ical discourses for the purpose of exclusion policies (Titley
& Lentin, 2008). Stereotypes, prejudices, and hate speech are
being used and promoted in the media, in schools, and other
public institutions. They act as a filter of information. They
affect not only the victim of the bias but also every individual
who witnesses the bias as well as the perpetrator (Rivers,
Poteat, Noret, & Ashurst, 2009).

Civic and Intercultural Education:
A Means for Community Development
and Attitude Change
Oana Nestian Sandu1
Abstract
Our societies are going through a process of continuous transformation. The challenges and opportunities of diversity and
globalization can only be addressed if civic education and intercultural education are interrelated. More often than not,
there is a lack of coherence between educational practices based on these approaches. Moreover, even if the principles
and methods of civic and intercultural education are used for international as well as local development, very seldom their
impact is measured through the means of scientific research. In this study, a methodology of civic and intercultural education
was piloted, and its impact was measured regarding teachers' and students' attitudes toward Roma. We measured the
acculturation orientations and stereotypes of teachers and students involved in a civic and intercultural program. The results
show that there are changes in both teachers' and students' attitudes toward Roma.

Haslam and Dovidio (2010) analyzed the researches in the
area and identified the main factors that enhance and maintain
bias: personality and individual differences, intergroup con-
flict, social categorization, and social identity. Education and
learning about the subject of the stereotypes or prejudices
facilitates the development of acceptance of differences and
contributes to social cohesion (Plant & Devine, 2009).
People often resist change due to the cognitive dissonance
related to their previous beliefs and behaviors (Tausch &
Hewstone, 2010). Conscious effort and perseverance are
needed for real change to take place. Educational programs
should take into account this aspect and should focus not
only on giving participants the opportunity to learn about the
changes they need to make but also to reflect and to act upon
them.
A real impact of civic and intercultural education implies
"moving away from a focus on individual (identity)
difference/s towards a focus on finding, through principled
intercultural discourse, consensus for social action to redress
injustice and inequality in the multicultural society" (Ohana
& Otten, 2012, p.219).
Intercultural education offers an alternative to multicul-
turalism (Lentin & Titley, 2011; O'Cinneide, 2012; Rus,
2008). The intercultural approach facilitates the dialogue
between different sociocultural groups, addresses power
relations, and encourages positive relation in the society.
Intercultural education aims to ensure a balance between
freedom of expression and respect for cultural diversity,
acknowledging and respecting diverse practices and
worldviews.
The approach and methods of intercultural education need
to be oriented toward focusing on "social action," to develop
participants' competences to act for social change that they
identified as necessary (Ohana & Otten, 2012) and to take a
stand against discrimination, racism, and other forms of
intolerance and social injustice.
Understanding how stereotypes and prejudices affect the
self, the others, and the human relations is at the forefront of
developing attitudes and behaviors that promote positive
social change, prevent social injustices, and enhance positive
relations. For this reason, there is a need for qualitative and
quantitative studies that aim at understanding the means
through which intercultural attitudes, abilities, and knowl-
edge can be developed (Perry & Southwell, 2011).
The Intercultural Institute of Timisoara1 has piloted over
the years a series of methods aiming at developing teachers'
and students' intercultural competence and motivation for
participation in local decision-making processes, as well as
the development of a nuanced and fair understanding of
Roma issues and contribution to their social development.
Roma minority is 1 of the 20 recognized national minorities
in Romania, one of the most disadvantaged and discrimi-
nated against. Romania is the European country with the big-
gest Roma population and a wide diversity of communities,
some maintaining a traditional lifestyle, others being almost
completely assimilated, some having a socioeconomic status
similar to that of the majority population, while most of them
are living in extreme poverty (Rus, 2008).
A series of public policies are implemented in different
areas of life, to ensure equal access of Roma people to educa-
tion and employment, but very little is done to change the
negative attitudes of the majority population toward Roma.
Recent sociological studies confirm the persistence of high
levels of negative attitudes toward Roma, even if there are
some improvements over the years (Paunescu, 2011;
Tarnovschi, 2012).
A Civic and Intercultural Education
Program
This study makes an analysis of the impact of a civic and
intercultural education methodology requiring students to
analyze the situation of the Roma community at local revel
and formulate a public policy proposal related to an issue
affecting members of Roma communities.
The method was piloted at national level in 2011 in 11
schools, finalized with a public presentation at the Romanian
Parliament, and at county level in 2012 in 9 schools. The aim
of the program is to promote competent and responsible par-
ticipation with government at all levels. The program helps
participants learn how to monitor and influence public policy
while developing support for democratic values and princi-
ples. The program takes place over a 3-month period in which
teachers attend a training course and implement a project with
their students. It is based on a methodology developed at
international level in the CIVITAS Network1, adapted to
Romanian realities and developed by the Intercultural
Institute of Timisoara to include the intercultural dimension.
This method offers students a framework to develop a
thorough understanding of the situation of Roma communi-
ties and to overcome stereotypes and prejudices. It addresses,
at the same time, the need to stimulate the civic engagement
and constructive attitudes based on democracy and human
rights.
The main activities implemented in the program by the
students, under the coordination of their teacher, are as fol-
lows: (a) analysis of the problems of the local Roma com-
munity; (b) selection of a problem for in-depth study by the
class, a problem that can be solved through local public poli-
cies; (c) collecting information about the problem from vari-
ous sources, including members of the Roma community,
public institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
specialists, and analysis of possible solutions; (d) drafting a
public policy that could solve the problem; (e) developing an
action plan to influence public authorities to adopt the public
policy proposed by the students; (f) organizing a showcase in
which students present their projects; and (g) reflecting on
the learning experience. Classes involved in the program are
then invited to present their projects in a public event attended
by public authorities and the media.

Prior to the implementation of the activities with students,
teachers attend a blended learning training course, which has
the following objectives:
·
· understanding of the way in which public institutions
function, the decision-making procedures, and the
role of citizens in a democratic society;
·
· development of intercultural sensitivity to understand
the benefits and challenges of diversity, especially
related to the fact that:
|
|
ignoring cultural differences is not a solution,
|
|
imposing an ethnocultural belonging on someone
is unacceptable,
|
|
different ethnocultural belongings do not neces-
sarily imply visible differences,
|
|
common ethnocultural belongings do not neces-
sarily imply homogeneity, and
|
|
not all cultural practices are acceptable in a human
rights framework;
·
· in-depth understanding of the situation of Roma com-
munities in Romania; and
·
· learning to implement the program's specific civic
and intercultural methodology with students.
As part of the program, the students learn about their Roma
people living in their neighborhood. Most often people rely
on stereotypes when interacting with the Roma, and usually
avoid getting to know their Roma neighbors. The students
are guided through a process in which the output is a public
policy solution to one of the problems of the Roma commu-
nity. This program offers them the opportunity to interact
with members of the Roma community, to learn about the
problems they are struggling with, and to view them as equal
citizens. Students find out that some of the problems the
Roma are facing are very similar to the ones the rest of the
society is facing, while others are very different, often due to
the cultural specificities and usually the poor living
conditions.
The impact of the program is evaluated both at teachers'
level, as well as at students' level. Through a pretest­posttest
methodology, the teachers' and students' stereotypes and
attitudes toward the culturally different (respectively, Roma
minority) are being assessed before and after they are
involved in the program.
Attitudes Toward Roma Minority
Method and Sample
This study uses a pretest­posttest design to measure the
changes in teachers' and students' orientations of acculturation
and stereotypes toward Roma and Romanians. A group of 33
teachers and 250 students, from 20 schools, belonging mainly
to the majority population participated in this study. About half
of them participated in the civic and intercultural education
program (experimental group), while the other half participated
in a civic education program using a similar methodology but
without intercultural component (control group).
Instruments
Drawing on previous research by Berry, Bourhis, Moise,
Perreault, and Senécal (1997) proposed the following accul-
turation orientations of majority members--integrationism,
individualism, assimilationism, segregationism, and exclu-
sionism--and developed a scale to measure these accultura-
tionorientations.Basically,theseorientationsofacculturation
represent the combination of possible answers to the follow-
ing two questions: (a) How acceptable it is for the majority
population that the minority (Roma, in our case) maintain
their culture? and (b) How acceptable it is for the majority
population that the minority (Roma, in our case) adopt the
culture of the majority population? (see Figure 1).
Integrationism refers to the valorization of maintenance
of certain aspects of minority identity and willingness to
modify own institutional practices and certain aspects of
majority culture to facilitate integration of minority groups.
Assimilationism refers to desire to have minorities give up
their cultural/identity characteristics to adopt the cultural/
identity characteristics of majority. Segregationism repre-
sents tolerance for the minority culture/identity as long as
they live separately, in specific neighborhoods or regions, and
do not mix with the majority population. Exclusionism means
no tolerance for the minorities'culture/identity and belief that
certain groups can never assimilate within majority commu-
nity. There is also another acculturation orientation that com-
pletely ignores cultural, religious, and linguistic belonging
while focusing on personal characteristics--individualism.
The scale developed based on this model by Bourhis and
Montreuil (2005) is not intended to categorize individuals as
How acceptable it is for the majority population that the minority (Roma, in
our case) maintain their culture?
How acceptable it is for the majority
population that the minority (Roma,
in our case) adopt the culture of the
majority population?
YES NO
YES Integrationism Assimilationism
NO Segregrationism Exclusionism

being integrationist, individualist, assimilationist, segrega-
tionist, or exclusionist. This scale is intended to assess the
extent to which individuals endorse each of the acculturation
orientations, depending on the specific group being consid-
ered. The teachers' acculturation orientations are measured
with regard to six areas of life: culture, customs, work,
endogamy/exogamy, language, and neighborhood. The stu-
dents' acculturation orientations are measured with regard to
five areas of life: customs, educational activities, friends,
language, and neighborhood.
Taking into account the potential of social desirability of
the Host Community Acculturation Scale, another instru-
ment was used to have a more nuanced perspective of the
teachers' and students' attitudes toward Roma. A list of attri-
butes was used to measure the stereotypes of students and
teachers toward Roma and Romanians.
The data collected were analyzed in SPSS using the
paired-samples t test.
Results
The analysis of the results in the pretest samples of teachers
and students shows a medium level of exclusionism (1.74/5),
segregationism (2.25/5), and assimilationism (2.14/5), and
slightly higher results on individualism (4.15/5) and integra-
tionism (3.88/5). There were no significant differences
between the experimental group and the control group in the
pretest phase. At first sight, these results can be slightly
encouraging, with pretty high level of integrationism and
quite low level of exclusionism. However, the analysis of the
results regarding the stereotypes shows that the entire sample
associates significantly more negative attributes with Roma
(4 attributes associated significantly more with Roma than
with Romanians) and more positive attributes with
Romanians (11 attributes associated significantly more with
Romanians than with Roma). There was no negative attri-
bute associated more with Romanians than with Roma and
there was only 1 positive attribute associated more with
Roma than Romanians--musicians. These results are com-
parable with the results of various studies done at national
level which show that the majority population has mainly
negative attitudes toward Roma (Rus, 2008), validating
therefore the sample used in this study.
The participation in the civic and intercultural program
generated significant changes in the acculturation orienta-
tions of teachers and students after their participation in the
program, both compared with the pretest phase and with the
control group.
Regarding changes in the orientations of acculturation,
after the implementation of the civic and intercultural pro-
gram, teachers are less assimilationists, t(17) = 2.16, p< .05,
and students are less individualists, t(138) = 2.83, p< .01.
The fact that teachers have lower scores on assimilationist
orientation shows they understood the importance of main-
taining and affirming cultural identity and expect much less
from the Roma people to give up their cultural identity to
adopt the cultural identity of the majority community. This
attitudinal change of teachers could have contributed to the
attitudinal change of students. Not only are students less
individualist but there are also significant changes in relation
to specific areas of life.
Students have, after the implementation of the program,
higher scores on the segregationist orientation regarding
school activities and friends. They are also less exclusionist
regarding school activities, t(139) = 3.43, p< .01, which
means they are less inclined to consider that Roma should
not attend the same school as them, and less integrationist,
t(135) = 6.08, p< .01, which means they are not yet ready to
consider them full members of the school community. Most
of the statistical significant changes regarding students'
acculturation orientations are related to the domain of school
activities, which means that their participation in the project
and activities of the program had a direct impact on this
dimension, without being extrapolated to the other dimen-
sions. The fact that the teachers have lower levels of assimi-
lationism shows they understood the importance of cultural
identity and focused on it. At the same time, students under-
stood the importance of culture but failed to understand the
importance of dialogue--which is shown in their higher lev-
els of segregationism.
There were no significant changes generated by the partici-
pation in the program of the control group in general, just on
specific domains of life. These changes are in the sense of
higher scores regarding segregationism and assimilationism in
certain domains of life. For example, the teachers were more
assimilationists regarding culture, t(14) = 2.09, p< .05, and
marriage, t(14) = 2.20, p< .05, and more segregationists regard-
ing work, t(14) = 2.97, p< .05. The students were more segre-
gationists regarding the neighborhood, t(104) = 2.57, p< .05.
Therefore, even if the results show fewer changes in the
acculturation orientations than initially expected, the fact
that in the control group the changes were in the other direc-
tion (more segregationists and more assimilationists) leads to
the conclusion that the course had an important contribution
to the development of more positive attitudes of the majority
community toward Roma community and that the need for
this type of programs is even greater. It appears that without
organized educational processes, the tendency is to develop
higher levels of assimilationism and segregationism.
There are also significant changes regarding the stereo-
types of teachers and students toward Roma and Romanians.
A comparative analysis was made between teachers'and stu-
dents' stereotypes of Roma and Romanians before and after
the course. Before the course, teachers associated mainly
positive attributes with Romanians (11 attributes associated
statistically significant more with Romanians than with
Roma) and mainly negative attributes with Roma (4 attri-
butes associated statistically significant more with Roma
than with Romanians). After the course, they still associate
positive attributes more with Romanians than with Roma (10
Sandu 5
attributes associated statistically significant more with
Romanians than with Roma), but they associate just 1 nega-
tive attribute statistically significant more with Roma than
with Romanians.At the same time, the teachers in the control
group continue to associate negative attributes with Roma
even after the participation in the program (7 attributes asso-
ciated statistically significant more with Roma than with
Romanians). The changes in the students' stereotypes were
not so significant.
We also made a comparative analysis of the students' and
teachers' stereotypes toward Roma before and after the
course, to have a more nuanced image of the results pre-
sented above. This analysis shows that there are changes in
students'stereotypes in the sense of associating certain nega-
tive attributes to a smaller extent with Roma after the course
than before the course (there are statistically significant dif-
ferences on three negative attributes) and certain positive
attributes to a larger extent (there are statistically significant
differences on three positive attributes). Even if there were
not many significant differences in the Roma­Romanian
comparison, there are differences between the degree to
which students associate attributes to Roma before and after
the course. And this difference is in the sense of associating
less negative and more positive attributes with Roma.
Therefore, we can state that participation in a training
course and implementation of a civic intercultural program
contribute to diminishing teachers' and students' negative
attitudes toward Roma. These changes represent important
steps in the process of Roma inclusion and in diminishing the
negative perception of the majority population toward Roma.
Conclusion
The results are consistent with the results of a previous study
carried on by the Intercultural Institute, using qualitative
methods in a project involving cooperation between Roma
and non-Roma young people. In that study, after their partici-
pation in the program, non-Roma participants did not have
necessarily an overall better attitude about Roma, but they
had a more nuanced understanding of the situation and of the
relationships between Roma and the rest of the society and
were able to overcome certain stereotypes (Jivan, Rus, &
Bota, 2002).
This research proves, once again, that attitudinal changes
are difficult to obtain and even more difficult to measure.
Byram underlines the challenges related to the evaluation of
attitudes and values--While abilities and knowledge can be
adequately measured, the evaluation of attitudes and values
creates a series of technical and moral difficulties (Bandura,
2003). The instruments need to take into account, on one
hand, the social desirability and, on the other hand, the con-
text and the purpose for which they are applied. This perspec-
tive was taken into account in the design and implementation
of the study, as well as in the analysis of the results. For this
reason, the conclusions are cautiously presented.
The results of this study show that punctual interventions
aiming at increasing intercultural competence may have a
positive impact but a rather limited impact. To have a better
understanding of the way in which acculturation orientations
are changing through educational activities, it would be neces-
sary to compare the impact of various types of interventions.
One of the limits of the study is the fact that the relation
between the attitudes of teachers and those of students was
not analyzed. We believe that it is important to study this
relation in future research to identify whether sole imple-
mentation of educational practices, regardless of teachers'
personal attitudes, can contribute to the development of posi-
tive attitudes of students toward diversity or whether it is
absolutely necessary that teachers attitudes be positive. In
the first case, educational policies should focus on equipping
teachers with educational tools to ensure an integrationist
approach in education, whereas in the second case, the main
activities need to aim at the development of teachers' inter-
cultural competence.
Another limit of the study is the fact that teachers have
voluntarily applied to participate in the program, having
therefore an intrinsic motivation to participate and interest in
the subject. Thus, we do not know to what extent the same
results could be obtained with a group of teachers who are
not interested in the subject. Students' participation, how-
ever, was not voluntary, as the activities of the project were
part of the school curriculum.
The results of this research can offer relevant information
for decision-making bodies regarding public policies in the
field of education. For example, practices like the inclusion
of information about Roma in the history manuals can not
only lead to a decrease of exclusionism but could also lead to
an increase of segregationism, and it is therefore important
that they are accompanied by activities focused on dialogue,
interaction, and human rights­based approaches.
The European Commission and other national and inter-
national bodies finance various programs in the field of civic
and intercultural education for community development. As
much as there is a need for these programs, there is also a
need for extended research to measure the impact of these
programs and to identify best practices of coherent, flexible,
and sustainable approaches in education.
