Introduction
In the next 20 years, it is expected that a significant transfer
of wealth will occur between the baby-boomer generation
and Generations X and Y in Australia and many other aging
societies (Kelly & Harding, 2006). Cultural norms underpin-
ning these intergenerational asset and wealth transfers (e.g.,
through wills) are shifting due to social and demographic
changes (Sappideen, 2008). The impact on intergenerational
transfers of these major social and demographic changes as
well as the changes in levels of retirement income and asset
size and complexity has received limited attention. Family
structures are changing with increased acceptance of cohabi-
tation, same sex relationships and shared parenthood, multi-
ple marriages, and blended and step families. Such changes
to the traditional patterns of marriage and parenthood can
create complexity regarding definitions of who is immediate
family and hence the nature of testator and beneficiary obli-
gations (Angel, 2008; Izuhara, 2010). Intergenerational
transfers and estate planning are also more difficult due to
uncertainty about policy changes to private and public pen-
sions and the need to provide for potentially higher user
charges in health and aged care in later life. The transmission
of multiple and large asset holdings, family businesses, and
rural properties raises particular issues around sequencing
and timing of asset transmission as well as principles under-
pinning distribution and transfer (Gaffney-Rhys & Jones,
2013; Gilding, 2005; Tilse etal., 2006). As a result of immi-
gration, Australia is increasingly a culturally diverse society.
Norms and prescriptions in all cultures specify expectations
regarding inheritance and expectations and practices around
intergenerational transfers, reciprocity, and other societal
obligations.
It is important that researchers, lawyers, policy makers,
and legislators are cognizant of these changes and their
potential to influence community expectations regarding
asset transfer. Family provision legislation in Australian
legal jurisdictions reflects principles of reciprocity (i.e., a
beneficiary's deservingness based on the level of contact and
care they provided to the deceased) and need (i.e., a testator's
responsibility to provide for individuals based on their level
of need; Sappideen, 2008). How well these laws work in bal-
ancing testamentary freedom with obligations to provide for
family and broader expectations around inheritance and fam-
ily relationships is open to challenge. There is also emerging
evidence that the number of will contests is growing
(McGregor-Lowndes & Hannah, 2009). Consequently,

Making and Changing Wills: Prevalence,
Predictors, and Triggers

Abstract
Wills are important social, economic, and legal documents. Yet little is known about current will making practices and
intentions. A comprehensive national database on the prevalence of will making in Australia was developed to identify who is
or is not most likely to draw up a will and triggers for making and changing wills. A national survey of 2,405 adults aged above
18 years was administered by telephone in August and September 2012. Fifty-nine percent of the Australian adult population
has a valid will, and the likelihood of will making increases with age and estate value. Efforts to get organized, especially in
combination with life stage and asset changes trigger will making; procrastination, rather than a strong resistance, appears
to explain not making a will. Understanding will making is timely in the context of predicted significant intergenerational
transfers of wealth, changing demographics, and a renewed emphasis on retirement planning.

decisions regarding the way in which a deceased estate is
distributed may increasingly be made in Court.
Dying intestate or without a valid and current will results
in allocation of assets according to different legal provisions
in each Australian state. These provisions may or may not fit
the needs of the increasingly complex range of family struc-
tures and relationships and/or may result in inequity. For
example, assumptions about family support underpinning
intestacy provisions do not necessarily fit all cultural groups
(Vines, 2011). In the event of contestation of an intestate
estate pursuant to family provision legislation, a court may
determine, in accordance with the criteria in that legislation,
to distribute the assets in a different way. This process can
cause additional cost, inconvenience, and stress to families at
what is already a difficult time.
To date, research has provided little consistent insight into
the reasons why some individuals die intestate. Knowing
who does not make a will and why is important in under-
standing changing practices and intentions. It is important to
better understand the attitudinal, cultural, informational, and
systemic reasons why people do or do not make a will and
use of alternatives to a legally drafted will. Furthermore,
understanding the range of attitudes toward will making is
vital in enhancing methods of organizing, managing, and
marketing estate management and developing programs to
increase the prevalence of current and valid wills within the
adult population. This article explores the prevalence of will
making, identifies who are most and least likely to draft a
will, and what prompts people to make and change wills. It
forms part of a larger project on the prevalence, patterns, and
practices of wealth transfers through wills in Australia, the
principles commonly underpinning this form of asset distri-
bution and will contestation.
Background
Prevalence and Predictors of Will Making or
Changing
The proportion of adults reported to have a valid will at any
one point in time has varied markedly across research sam-
ples, time frames, and countries. For example,
·
· In an online survey, 31% of a representative sample of
American respondents aged 19 or older (n = 324) had
made a will (DiRusso, 2009)
·
· 37% of English and Welsh respondents aged 16 years
and above who completed face-to-face surveys (n =
1,556) had made a will (Douglas, Woodward,
Humphrey, Mills, & Morrell, 2011; Humphrey, Mills,
Morrell, Douglas, & Woodward, 2010)
·
· 58% of a representative sample of Australian respon-
dents aged 18 and above surveyed by telephone inter-
view (n = 6,209) had made a will (Giving Australia,
2005)
·
· 66% of a representative sample of American respon-
dents aged 70 or older (n = 521), a subsample from the
Study of Aging and Health Dynamics (AHEAD), had
made a will (Goetting & Martin, 2001)
·
· 79% of Queensland (Australian) respondents (n =
820) aged above 35 interviewed through a telephone
survey had made a will (Wilson & Tilse, 2012)
·
· 96% of Australian respondents aged above 50 (n =
6,789) who completed a written questionnaire had
made a will (Olsberg & Winters, 2005).
Research has been able to identify personal characteristics
associated with will makers, for example, older age
(Humphrey etal., 2010; State Trustees Limited, 2012), female
gender (Baker & Gilding, 2011; Gaffney-Rhys & Jones,
2013), being married or in a relationship (Humphrey etal.,
2010; Wilson & Tilse, 2012), being/becoming a parent (Baker
& Gilding, 2011; Olsberg & Winters, 2005), and having a
high value estate (Dekker & Howard, 2006; Olsberg &
Winters, 2005). There are, however, some conflicting find-
ings relating to whether being a parent (Wilson & Tilse, 2012)
and having greater financial worth (State Trustees Limited,
2012; Whitaker, 2007) differentiate will makers from non-
will makers. There is less understanding of circumstances or
events that motivate an individual to prepare a will. The avail-
able evidence suggests relationship changes (e.g., marriage)
and life events (e.g., parenthood, illness, retirement, death of
a family member or friend) as well as changes in assets (e.g.,
home ownership, inheritance) may prompt people to make a
will (Humphrey etal., 2010; Rowlingson, 2000).
Using data from a longitudinal study of American adults,
Palmer, Bhargava, and Hong (2006) investigated whether the
likelihood of having a will between two phases of data col-
lection (1996 and 2000) was associated with the experience
of significant life events during the same period. The authors
found that participants who had become widowed, diagnosed
with cancer, retired, or had increased their assets were most
likely to have made a will. A study of 41 men and women
from different age cohorts and socio-economic situations in
the United Kingdom reported similar triggers (Rowlingson,
2000). In-depth interviews revealed illness of self or signifi-
cant others, the death of a relative or friend, acting as an
executor, changes in family circumstances and planning to
undertake long distance travel triggered will making
(Rowlingson, 2000). However, many people who do not
experience significant life events make wills and conversely
some do not make wills despite experiencing such events. In
a national survey of England and Wales, respondents who
had children living with them were half as likely to have a
will as those without children living in the household
(Brooker, 2007) suggesting that currently having dependent
children is not necessarily a trigger for making a will.
Researchers still do not fully understand the various triggers
of will making, their interaction, and their impact at different
life stages.
Tilse et al. 3
Research exploring triggers for decisions to make a will
generally does not make a distinction between making and
changing a will. Making a will for the first time, however, is
likely to differ from updating a will in that the former involves
deciding to take action to plan for the future, whereas the latter
is about updating due to life changes or re-evaluating life cir-
cumstances having already shown a propensity to plan. Recent
research undertaken by State Trustees Limited, Victoria (2012)
found that around half of the respondents with a will had
updated it at least once, although fewer respondents under 50
years of age had changed their will. This suggests that with
increasing life expectancies, most people who have wills are
likely to update them at least once in their lives.
Prevalence and Predictors of Non-Will Making
Few non-will makers make a deliberate decision not to make
a will (Humphrey et
al., 2010; Wilson & Tilse, 2012).
Reasons for not making a will range from a view that the
distributive principles embodied by intestacy laws are suffi-
cient (Browder, 1969), psychological fears regarding mortal-
ity or an unwillingness to contemplate death, perceptions
that the process of making a will is overly costly, complex,
and obscure (Weisbord, 2012), having other arrangements
such as joint accounts in place and/or believing there is noth-
ing of value to leave (Finch & Mason, 2000; Wilson & Tilse,
2012). Variable knowledge of entitlements for same sex and
cohabiting couples is also reported (Rowlingson & McKay,
2005; Weisbord, 2012). Surveys conducted in Australia and
Britain suggest procrastination primarily accounts for intes-
tacy (Humphrey etal., 2010; Wilson & Tilse, 2012).
Aim
This article answers the following research questions:
Research Question 1: What is the prevalence of having a
valid will?
Research Question 2: What are the predictors of having
a will?
Research Question 3: What differentiates those who do
and do not have a will?
Research Question 4: What knowledge do people have
of the consequences of dying intestate?
Research Question 5: What are the triggers for making
and changing wills?
Although the research is Australian-based, its findings are
relevant for comparable legal jurisdictions and cultures
internationally.
Method
The study reported here is the first component of a 4-year
program of research examining will making and will
contestation in Australia (project webpage left blank for
blind review). The research has four major components.
1. A national prevalence study involving a telephone
survey of 2,405 respondents aged 18 or above.
2. Document analysis exploring contested estates in (a)
a judicial case review of 215 contested cases involv-
ing disputes about 195 estates in Australia in 2011
identifying the legal grounds relied on in contesting
wills, disputants' characteristics, and underlying
motives and outcomes of contestation (White etal.,
2015), and (b) a review of Public Trustee files involv-
ing disputed cases (N = 139). The Public Trustee is a
statutory body providing deceased estates adminis-
tration, free or low-cost will drafting, financial man-
agement, and other services. The cases identified
were dealt with, in the first instance, by the Public
Trustee, and many were settled outside court.
3. A national online survey of public and private will
document drafters exploring current processes, prac-
tices, and challenges in drafting wills.
4. Interviews with will and non-will makers exploring
in greater depth issues identified in the preceding
research components.
This article uses data generated in Stage 1, the national
prevalence survey. Following project approval by (university
name and approval number left blank for blind review)
Ethics Committee, a telephone survey was administered.
Quota sampling based on population size within each State
and Territory was used, with oversampling in smaller legal
jurisdictions (Australian CapitalTerritory, NorthernTerritory,
and Tasmania) to ensure adequate numbers for analysis. The
sample was age-stratified to ensure at least half of respon-
dents were aged 18 to 45 years. The inclusion of a substantial
proportion of younger respondents is important as prior
research suggests that this group is the least likely to have
made a will. Age stratification also ensured the sample
reflects the age distribution of the Australian population in
which approximately half of adults are aged 18 to 45 years
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011b).
Surveys were conducted in August and September 2012
using random fixed-line contact numbers to recruit the sam-
ple. Random number generation, as opposed to using pre-
existing lists, provides greater coverage. Although sampling
was limited to fixed-line numbers, we do not expect this to
have significantly affected the results. When compared with
Census data (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011a, 2011b,
2013), the sample obtained was broadly representative of
the Australian population with respect to age, gender, cul-
tural characteristics, and rates of home ownership. It has
been shown that younger males, renters, and those from cul-
turally diverse backgrounds are more likely to have only a
mobile phone (Jackson, Pennay, Dowling, Coles-Janess, &
Christensen, 2014).
4 SAGE Open
A total of 12,110 households were randomly contacted by
telephone with 40% (4,846) of calls falling outside the sam-
ple (e.g., no one above 18 available, jurisdictional or age
quotas already met). From the remaining 7,264 households,
a sample was drawn of 2,405 respondents aged 18 years or
above (see Table 1). Respondents were asked 35 questions
covering demographic information; will making intentions,
motivations, triggers, and inclusions; information/advice
accessed; and prior experience with other people's wills.
Most questions were open ended. Responses were coded in
situ by interviewers using response categories established
during pilot research. Any response that did not fit within a
pre-existing category was recorded verbatim and later coded
by the authors.
Respondents were fairly evenly distributed across age
groups, except for the very young (18-24) and very old (75+)
who were slightly under represented. Half the sample was
male (n = 1,200, 50%). The sample was representative of the
Australian population with respect to cultural characteristics
with 40% of the respondents either overseas-born or with at
least one parent born overseas (compared with 46%,
Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011b).
Statistical procedures were implemented using SPSS
Version 21 (IBM). Statistical significance was set at 5% (p 
.05). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate sta-
tistics, including frequencies, cross-tabulations, chi-square
tests, and t tests. Logistic regression was used to identify pre-
dictors of having or not having a will.
Results
Prevalence of Will Making
Approximately 59% of the sample (n = 1,425) had a will.
Non-will makers were more prevalent among younger peo-
ple (see Table 1). For example, 90% of those aged between
18 and 29 did not have a will, whereas more than 90% of the
respondents aged 70 years or older had one.
Predictors of Will Making
Variables significantly associated with will making at the 5%
level in bivariate analyses were considered for inclusion in
multivariate logistic regression. These variables (gender,
relationship status, parenthood, ethnic diversity, acting as an
executor, and becoming a guardian) were entered into a mul-
tivariate logistic regression equation alongside age and esti-
mated estate value (Table 2). Other demographic variables
not associated with will making behavior in the current
research, but shown in previous research to be associated
with will making, were also entered into the model. These
included level of education, receiving a bequest, experience
advising others about will making, and being involved in a
legal dispute over the way in which a person's assets should
be distributed after his or her death.
Results revealed that age (being older) and higher estate
value were the strongest predictors of whether or not people
had a will, whereas other characteristics (e.g., relationship
status, gender, and ethnic diversity) contributed little to the
ability to distinguish between will makers and non-will mak-
ers. Age alone was able to accurately classify three quarters
of the sample as either a will maker or non-will maker.1 For
each year older an adult grows, his or her likelihood of hav-
ing a will increases by 10%. Age and estimated estate value
combined accurately classified 78% of the sample.2 Adding
in the remaining variables improved the model's ability to
classify respondents by only 1%.3
Differentiating those who do and do not have a will.Non-will
makers constituted 41% of the respondents. Of this group,
54% expect to make a will in the future. A lack of time and/
or interest appears to account for the majority of non-will
making behavior. For example, the most common reasons
given by respondents for not having a will were as follows:
·
· I haven't got around to it (n = 492, 50%)
·
· I haven't thought about it (n = 270, 28%)
Only a few non-will makers identified barriers to will
making such as the costs involved in preparing a will (n = 16,
2%) or complex process issues (n = 15, 1%), although these
factors may contribute to procrastination. Of those who did
not currently have a will, fewer than 1% cited unwillingness
to consider mortality as a contributing factor. However, it is
possible that most people unwilling to contemplate these
issues did not agree to participate in the survey.

Even among non-will makers who indicated they cur-
rently did not intend to prepare a will (n = 452, 46%), the
most common reasons for not preparing a will were not
thinking about it (n = 183, 40%) and/or not getting around to
it (n = 117, 26%). "Procrastinators" can be identified fairly
easily from the data. They are relatively young (on average

40 years of age), parents with financial dependent(s), and in
possession of an estate they assessed as being worth less than
$500,000.
It is interesting to note, however, that around one fifth of
non-will makers who did not intend to prepare a will believed
they did not have anything of value to leave (n = 100, 22%)
or that they did not need a will at this time in their lives (n =
87, 19%). Perceptions of the value of assets and the signifi-
cance of life stage responsibilities seem to be important in
decisions about making a will. For the vast majority of those
without a will, making a will is something they should "get
around to doing" rather than relying on the state to distribute
their assets according to intestacy legislation. No non-will
makers spoke about using alternatives to wills such as inter-
vivos transfers or an unwillingness to pass on assets to the
next generation as a motivation for not having a will.
Knowledge of the Consequences of Dying
Intestate
Non-will makers were asked what they thought the law said
would happen to a person's assets if they died without a will.4
The response options are included in Figure 1. There was also
an "I don't know" option; however, very few respondents (n
= 29, 3%) stated they did not know what would happen. A
higher proportion of respondents incorrectly believed that the
law said that family members (n = 387, 39%), rather than
intestacy laws (which were described in general terms in the
survey; n = 269, 27%), would determine how assets should be
divided between surviving relatives. A similar proportion of
non-will makers believed the law said that the courts would
be required to divide assets between family members (n =
156, 16%) or they believed the law gave the government the
first right to the assets (n = 139, 14%).
This pattern was largely consistent across key demo-
graphic variables, including age, gender, relationship status,
ethnic diversity, and estate value. Significant differences
were observed, however, between non-will makers who
intended to make a will at some stage and those who did not
intend to make a will (see Figure 1).5 Non-will makers who
intended to prepare a will were significantly more likely to
believe that the law said the government had first right to
their assets than believe that their family can determine how
assets are divided. By contrast, non-will makers who did not
intend to prepare a will were significantly more likely to
believe family members and relatives were responsible for
dividing up the assets.6
This research provided little evidence to suggest that the
decision not to make a will is driven by an awareness of the
consequences of dying intestate. For example, only seven
out of 980 non-will makers reported not having a will because
they believed existing laws would divide their assets
appropriately:
·
· I'm happy with the laws
·
· I don't think about death. I presume my assets will go
to my closest relatives
·
· I have faith in the system
However, there was wide variation in their understanding
of intestacy laws among non-will makers who do not intend
to prepare a will. Three respondents believed laws set out
how their assets would be divided, two believed family
would be responsible for dividing their assets, and two
respondents believed the government or the courts would
divide their assets.
Overall, non-will makers'understanding of intestacy laws
varied markedly. It is also interesting to note that only 8%
Figure 1. Non-will makers' beliefs about what the law says about how their assets will be divided if they die intestate as a function of
their intention to prepare a will.
Tilse et al. 7
(n = 108) of will makers described their main purpose in hav-
ing a will as being to ensure the government does not step in.
Thus, it appears that it is not concerns about intestacy laws
that prompt will making.
Triggers That Prompt Will Making
Will makers were asked what events had triggered their will
making. The three most commonly reported events were as
follows:
efforts to get organized in general (n = 751, 53%)
having children (n = 299, 21%)
acquiring more assets (n = 240, 17%).
Very few will makers attributed their decision to prepare
a will to generic advertising or third party suggestion (e.g.,
from family members or professionals). Most (n = 1,170,
82%) believed that no one had prompted them to prepare
their most recent will. These findings suggest that although
there are a range of circumstances that potentially trigger
will making, the circumstances that ultimately lead an indi-
vidual to prepare a will are likely to be specific for that per-
son. Most individual will makers reflect a view that the
decision to make a will must come from them and be moti-
vated by self-assessment of their circumstances. Having
made the decision to prepare a will, respondents were most
likely to seek advice about making a will from their partner
(n = 369, 45%) and/or a lawyer (n = 363, 44%).
Non-will makers were asked what events might trigger
will making in the future. The majority of non-will makers
believed changes in health, financial, or family circumstances
would prompt will making. Circumstances that received
endorsement as a likely trigger of will making by at least 20%
(n = 196) of all non-will makers included the following:
·
· being diagnosed with a serious illness (n = 772, 79%)
·
· acquiring more assets (n = 468, 48%)
·
· efforts to get organized in general (n = 399, 41%)
·
· having children (n = 210, 21%)
·
· a death in the family (n = 205, 21%).
Will making can be reactive or proactive. It is of interest to
note that non-will makers were much more likely to nominate
a serious illness as a potential trigger in contrast to those who
had made a will. This suggests the importance of a real and
tangible confrontation with their own mortality as a primary
motivator for non-will makers in contrast to will makers who
appear more likely to plan in response to taking on (adult)
responsibilities such as having children or acquiring assets.
Triggers That Prompt Changes to Wills
Of the 1,425 will makers who participated in this research,
just under half had made changes to their will (n = 658,
46%). Within this group,
half had made changes only once (n = 321, 49%)
one quarter had made changes twice (n = 162, 25%)
the remaining quarter had made changes three or more
times (n = 175, 26%).
Compared with people who had not made changes to their
will, respondents who had made changes were older7 and had
estates of higher estimated value.8 For those who had made
three or more changes, having children or grandchildren and
relationship changes were significantly associated with will
revisions rather than changes in financial circumstances,
work, or health.
Those circumstances that prompted changes to wills were
similar to those that prompted individuals to prepare their
first will. The most commonly reported reason was having
children (n = 217, 33%). As shown in Table 3, changes were
most likely to address asset distribution and least likely to
reflect alterations to instructions regarding funeral, guardian-
ship, or health care arrangements.9
The relationship between demographic characteristics
and types of changes participants made to their wills reflected
the links between age and life course events. For example,
·
· people who added a beneficiary10 or changed guard-
ianship instructions11 were, on average, younger than
people who had not made these changes
·
· people who had changed executors12 or amended
funeral instructions13 were, on average, older than
those who had not
·
· a higher proportion of respondents not in a relationship,
in a new relationship, or in a de-facto relationship than
those who were currently or previously married had
removed a beneficiary.14

These results suggest that the changes made adjusted pro-
visions to meet evolving life circumstances in terms of the
current asset base, family responsibilities, and relationship
changes. For many, will making is part of ongoing planning
to protect assets and provide for family.
Discussion and Conclusion
Results revealed that approximately 59% ofAustralian adults
have a will, the greater proportion of these being older adults
and those who have acquired more assets. This is, interna-
tionally, a relatively high figure (DiRusso, 2009; Douglas
et
al., 2011; Humphrey et
al., 2010). Findings relating to
non-will makers suggest that procrastination, a lack of time
and/or interest, and perceived relevance for life stage, rather
than systemic barriers or resistance to the idea of will mak-
ing, account for most non-will making behavior, even among
those respondents who do not currently intend to prepare a
will. This is consistent with other research (Humphrey etal.,
2010; Wilson & Tilse, 2012). The high prevalence rate and
limited resistance to making will suggest that making a will
is generally accepted as a social norm.
The higher prevalence of will making in Australia than in
other Western countries especially the United States is inter-
esting. Even for comparable older age cohorts, Australian
rates of will making are much higher than in the United
States and the United Kingdom. Some American research
suggests dying without a will is the product of an overly
costly, complex, and obscure will making process (Weisbord,
2012); conversely, Australians surveyed here identified few
barriers in terms of cost or access to advice. This does not,
however, explain the difference between prevalence rates in
Australia, and in England and Wales (37% of those aged 16
and above); as in Australia, few non-will makers in England
and Wales identified lack of knowledge or cost as disincen-
tives (Brooker, 2007). As Brooker (2007) has suggested,
however, it is important to explore further whether procrasti-
nation actually masks other barriers such as not knowing
where to access information, concerns about discussing
inheritance in complex families, or lack of knowledge about
the utility of wills for more than asset distribution, for exam-
ple, guardianship arrangements.
There are a number of other differences between coun-
tries that might help to explain some variation in will making
prevalence. Compared with Americans, a higher proportion
of Australians have significant assets such as their own home
(69% cf. 65% in the United States and 68% in the United
Kingdom), a second home or investment property (20% cf.
5% in the United States and 11% in the United Kingdom),
and a personal superannuation (non-government pension
plan; 80% cf. 25% in the United States and 76% in the United
Kingdom15; Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013; Office for
National Statistics, 2014; U.S. Census Bureau, 2013). Given
fairly similar rates of asset ownership in the United Kingdom
and Australia, a more important factor may be that, unlike
the United States and the United Kingdom, there are no
inheritance taxes in Australia. Hence, in Australia, there are
no tax incentives to distribute wealth prior to death
(Wiepking, Madden, & McDonald, 2010), encouraging the
completion of a will to distribute assets after death.
Age and estate value were strongly associated with will
making, in keeping with earlier studies (e.g., Dekker &
Howard, 2006; Wilson & Tilse, 2012). Characteristics shown
in previous research to be associated with will making behav-
ior, such as gender, parenthood, and relationship status
(Baker & Gilding, 2011; Humphrey etal., 2010; Olsberg &
Winters, 2005), were less useful in distinguishing between
will makers and non-will makers here. Some studies suggest
there may be a misconception among younger people that
estate planning is only relevant to older and wealthier people
(Rowlingson & McKay, 2005). However, younger individu-
als can acquire significant assets, including life insurance
and superannuation payouts made at death. Younger people
with superannuation to be paid to their estate rather than a
nominated beneficiary require a will to ensure assets are dis-
tributed according to their preferences. Younger people may
also fail to recognize that wills are not only useful in transfer-
ring assets but are importantly a mechanism to put in place
guardianship and trust arrangements for dependent children
and to include or exclude ex-partners. It can also be impera-
tive to provide for a new partner for those who have sepa-
rated but not divorced.
What is clear is that knowledge (or more accurately lack
of knowledge) of the implications of dying intestate does not
drive the decision to make or not make a will. These findings
support previous research which has suggested that individu-
als have very little understanding of the consequences of
dying intestate (Rowlingson & McKay, 2005; Weisbord,
2012). It is worth noting that beliefs surrounding the value of
assets to bequeath influenced around one fifth of non-will
makers, the effect on non-will making rising as the value of
assets declines. This finding is consistent with earlier work
(e.g., Finch & Mason, 2000; Rowlingson & McKay, 2005;
Wilson & Tilse, 2012) and demonstrates that having both the
time and believing there is something to leave are influential
factors in the decision to draft a will.
The circumstances that trigger will making in previous
research include a range of changes in personal circum-
stances (e.g., marriage, parenthood, death of a loved one) or
personal wealth (e.g., buying a home, receiving an inheri-
tance; Humphrey et
al., 2010; Palmer et
al., 2006; State
Trustees Limited, 2012; Wilson & Tilse, 2012). The majority
of respondents identified more than one trigger for will mak-
ing, suggesting that a combination of factors leads people to
prepare a will. Will makers failed to consistently identify any
single specific change in personal circumstances that moti-
vated them to draft a will. Instead, when asked what trig-
gered them to prepare a will, respondents were most likely to
refer to general efforts to "get organized." This finding sug-
gests most individuals prepare a will at times when they are
Tilse et al. 9
taking steps to get their life in order. What triggers getting
their life in order requires further investigation. Responses to
questions about intentions in making or changing a will sug-
gest that providing for family and adjusting to changing fam-
ily circumstances are important. What is clear and consistent
is that most had accepted an obligation to make a will.
In this study, slightly less than half of respondents had
made changes to their will. The extent to which respondents'
wills reflected their current intentions and/or circumstances
was not clear. It is important that wills reflect testators' cur-
rent situation and intentions; accordingly regularly review-
ing and updating a will are extremely important throughout
life. Contestation arising from not having an up to date will
can substantially reduce the value of the estate or even con-
sume it all (Begleiter, 1994) and leave a legacy of family
discord and mistrust (Love & Sterk, 2008; Stimmel, 2002).
The policy and practice issues arising from this research
include how to (a) ensure people have a valid and up-to-date
will that truly reflects current assets, life circumstances, and
intentions, and (b) encourage people with dependents to see
wills as the way of formally nominating guardians and trust-
ees for minors.
The findings of few attitudinal and systemic barriers to
will making, and the common view that will making is indi-
vidually initiated rather than prompted by advertising sug-
gest that awareness raising campaigns (e.g., advertising by
the Public Trustees highlighting free will making services
and educating the community about the purpose of will mak-
ing) are likely to have little impact on non-will makers. Most
will makers consider that the decision to make a will must
come from them in response to a self-assessment of their cir-
cumstances. This suggests that the appropriate timing and
methods of targeting Australians to encourage making the
initial will need to be considered in more detail.
Despite the above limitations, the research findings sug-
gest some useful avenues for targeted public education.
Efforts to get organized, especially in combination with life
stage and asset changes, trigger will making. Targeted cam-
paigns promoting will making for various age groups that
link to life stage events are therefore likely to have impact. A
key focus should be on the quite large cohort of younger
people (those aged less than 50 years) who did not have
wills, particularly those with dependents. Intestacy laws are
poorly understood; however, this research indicates that pub-
lic education on this topic is unlikely to increase will making.
An alternate message of public education campaigns may be
around looking after family given that intestacy creates prob-
lems for families in terms of practical inconvenience.
Education campaigns also need to target current will mak-
ers about updating their will to ensure their will reflects cur-
rent circumstances and intentions. As with making an initial
will, prompts to consider updating wills in the event of
changes in assets, for example, as part of conveyancing
packages for properties (Brooker, 2007) and/or changing
family circumstances such as marriage, divorce, separation,
or the birth of a child could be useful. Campaigns intended to
promote will making may benefit from identifying the coin-
cidence of factors that encourage people to "get organized"
and include will making in educational and advertising strat-
egies to raise awareness about financial, retirement, and care
planning.
Very few participants reported using their wills to leave
additional instructions (e.g., funeral instructions). Although
wills are predominantly used as means of asset distribution,
they can be used for much wider purposes including nomi-
nating guardians for dependents to provide for their ongoing
care and support. Broadening the understanding of what a
will is for, how and when it should be updated, and the risks
and costs of contestation is an important issue to consider in
any social marketing strategy.
A strength of this study is that it is the first large-scale,
broad-based, nationally representative survey focusing spe-
cifically on will making undertaken in Australia. With a few
exceptions (e.g., DiRusso, 2009; Giving Australia, 2005;
Goetting & Martin, 2001), existing data are primarily based
on non-representative samples. A limitation is the relatively
low response rate (33%). However, this is similar to other
surveys (Vines, 2011; Wiepking etal., 2010) about wills and
estate planning and may reflect an avoidance of discussing
these issues. Furthermore, the sample was representative of
the broader Australian population on a number of indicators.
An additional limitation is that cross-sectional surveys do
not allow for exploration of changes in attitudes and prac-
tices over time and generations.
In the context of predicted large wealth transfers between
generations, increased cultural diversity, and changing fam-
ily structures, baseline data on the making and changing (or
lack of changing) of wills are critical. Failure to have a will,
or having a will that does not reflect current intentions, can
lead to distributions of wealth not wanted by a person as well
as contestation by family and others. This has significant
adverse consequences not only for the individuals involved
but also for the state, for example, through the cost of engag-
ing the judicial process to resolve these disputes. The starting
point for tackling these issues is understanding who is not
making or updating wills and why. This article provides an
evidence base for policy makers and will drafters to respond
to these challenges.

Notes
 1. Block, 2(1, N = 2,026) = 772.78, p < .001. Age is better able
to predict will makers (77% accuracy) than non-will makers
(72% accuracy).
 2. Block, 2(3, N = 2,026) = 936.72, p < .001. Age and estimated
estate value are better able to predict will makers (84% accu-
racy) than non-will makers (70% accuracy).
 3. Block, 2(11, N = 2,026) = 74.34, p < .001. The inclusion of
these additional characteristics improved the model's ability to
classify both non-will makers (71% accuracy) and will makers
(85% accuracy) over age and estimated estate value alone.
 4. Participants were only allowed to provide one response. The
question asked participants to put "aside property that is
jointly owned with another person that will pass automatically
to them" so as to focus on property that would ordinarily be
transferred by a will.
