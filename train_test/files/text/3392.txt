Abstract
Objective: To evaluate serum micro RNA-143 (miR-143) levels in patients with sepsis or non-
infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and investigate its possible diagnostic
or prognostic value.
Methods: Serum was obtained from patients with sepsis or SIRS and healthy control subjects.
Relative miR-143 expression was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain
reaction. The diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-143 was evaluated.
Results: Serum miR-143 levels were significantly higher in patients with sepsis (n ¼ 103) than
patients with SIRS (n ¼ 95) and healthy controls (n ¼ 40). There were significant positive
correlations between serum miR-143 level and SOFA and APACHE II scores in patients with
sepsis (r ¼ 0.794 and r ¼ 0.825, respectively). Serum miR-143 had a sensitivity of 78.6% and
specificity of 91.6% for distinguishing between sepsis and SIRS. There was no association between
serum miR-143 and 28-day survival in patients with sepsis.
Conclusion: Serum miR-143 is elevated in patients with sepsis, and may be a useful biomarker for
distinguishing between sepsis and SIRS.

Introduction
Sepsis is a serious medical condition char-
acterized by the simultaneous presence of
infection and systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS).1 Despite progress
in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques,
sepsis remains the main cause of death
for patients in intensive care units (ICUs),
with a 30-day mortality rate of 47%.2 Blood
microbiological culture analysis is the gold

standard to distinguish sepsis from SIRS
without infection, but this technique is
time-consuming and has a low early positive
rate (14.9 % during days 1­5 after sepsis
diagnosis).3 Thus, biomarkers for the early
diagnosis and accurate assessment of patients
with sepsis are urgently required.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of
endogenous, noncoding, single stranded,
small, regulatory RNA molecules of approxi-
mately 22 nucleotides in length4 that regulate
gene expression at the posttranscriptional
level by inducing mRNA degradation or
translational repression.5 MiRs contribute
to most basic biological processes, and aber-
rant miR expression has been observed in
many human disease states including
sepsis.6,7 More importantly, miRs are stably
expressed in human serum or plasma.8
Circulating miRs have been used as diagnos-
tic and prognostic biomarkers in many
diseases.9,10 Plasma levels of miR-150,11
miR-146a,12 miR-574-5p,13 miR-15a14 and
miR-1614 have been found to have prognostic
or diagnostic value in sepsis.
MiR-143 is associated with sepsis in
mouse lung,15 as well as in human
leukocytes after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
infusion.16 Sepsis is a complex disease
involving multiple organs and tissues, and
changes in leukocyte miR expression may
not be reflected in circulating miR levels.17,18
To our knowledge, the clinical significance
of serum miR-143 levels in patients with
sepsis has not been studied. The aim of the
present study, therefore, was to evaluate
serum miR-143 levels in patients with sepsis
or non-infectious SIRS, and investigate its
possible diagnostic or prognostic value.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients with sepsis or
SIRS undergoing treatment at the
Department of Critical Care Medicine,
Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou,
Hebei Province, China, between January
2011 and May 2014. Patients were
diagnosed on the basis of blood microbio-
logical culture results, according to the
definitions of the American College of
Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care
Medicine.19 Inclusion criteria were: two or
more of (i) temperature > 38C or < 36C;
(ii) heart rate > 90/min; (iii) respiratory rate-
> 20/min or PaCO2
< 32 mmHg; (iv) white
blood cell count > 12000/mm3, < 4000/mm3,
or > 10 % immature (band) forms. Patients
aged younger than 18 years or who could
not receive adequate treatment due to eco-
nomic hardship were excluded. In patients
with sepsis, disease severity was assessed via
SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assess-
ment) score20 and APACHE II score21 on
day 1 after ICU admission, and all patients
were followed-up for 28 days A control
group of healthy volunteer subjects with no
known medical condition or infection at
the time of the study were recruited from the
Health Screening Centre, Cangzhou Central
Hospital, Cangzhou, Hebei Province,
China.
The study was approved by the research
ethics committee of Cangzhou Central
Hospital, and all subjects provided written
informed consent.
RT­PCR
Blood samples (5 ml) were obtained at the
time of initial blood microbiological culture
in patients, and at the time of health
screening in the control subjects. Blood
was centrifuged at 3500 Â g for 10 min at
room temperature immediately after collec-
tion to completely remove cell debris, then
transferred to RNase/DNase-free tubes and
stored at À80C until further processing.
Serum total RNA was extracted using
TRIzol solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to manufacturer's instruc-
tions, and cDNA was synthesized using a
One Step Prime-Script miRNA cDNA
876 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).
Real-time quantitative PCR (RT­qPCR) was
performed using a SYBR Prime-Script
miRNA qPCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga,
Japan) with an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Cycling conditions
were 95C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of
95C for 15s and 60C for 60s. All PCR
reactions were performed in triplicate, and
U6 snRNA was used as an internal control.
Expression levels of miR-143 were calculated
relative to U6 mRNA using the equation
2ÀÁCT, where ÁCT ¼ (CT
miR-143­CT
U6).
CRP and PCT assays
Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was quanti-
fied via scattering turbidimetry (CardioPhase
hsCRP, Siemens, Munich, Germany), and
procalcitonin (PCT) was quantified using
an enzyme-linked fluorescence analysis kit
(VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT kit, bioMerieux
SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France), according to the
manufacturers' instructions.
Statistical analyses
Sample size was calculated using the
formula N ¼ (Ua
/d)2 Â (1­P) Â P, assuming
an estimated sensitivity of 80% and specifi-
city of 90% for the validity of serum miR-
143 as a biomarker for discriminating
between sepsis and SIRS. We set a ¼ 0.05,
and d ¼ 0.08. Accordingly, the minimum
sample size was 96 for the sepsis group and
54 for the SIRS group.
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD or
median (range). Differences in serum miR-
143 levels were analysed using unpaired
Student's t test (between two groups) or
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA;
between three groups). Pearson's correlation
analysis was used to analyse the relationship
between serum miR-143 levels and clinical
scores. Receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were used to assess the
diagnostic value of serum miR-143
levels for sepsis vs SIRS, and the area
under curve (AUC) was calculated.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ, and P-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 103 patients with sepsis
(71 males/32 females; mean age 58.1 Æ 11.5
years; age range 22­68 years), 95 patients
with SIRS (65 males/30 females; mean age
59.6 Æ 10.2 years; age range 21­66 years),
and 40 healthy control subjects (22 males/18
females; mean age 58.8 Æ 10.7 years; age
range 22­65 years). Demographic and clin-
ical characteristics of the study groups are
shown in Table 1. Patients with sepsis had
significantly higher serum CRP and PCT
concentrations, and spent significantly
longer in the ICU than patients with SIRS
(P < 0.01 for each comparison; Table 1).
Serum miR-143 levels were significantly
higher in patients with SIRS or sepsis than
controls (P < 0.01), and in patients with
sepsis than those with SIRS (P < 0.001;
Table 1).
Data regarding miR-143 expression levels
in patients with sepsis are shown in Figure 1.
Patients with high SOFA scores (!7) or
APACHE II scores (! 10) had significantly
higher serum miR-143 levels than those with
low SOFA (< 7) or APACHE II scores
(< 10) (P ¼ 0.008 and Figure 1(b) P ¼ 0.004,
respectively; Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b)).
There was no significant difference in serum
miR-143 levels between those patients who
died and those who survived (at 28 days;
Figure 1(c)). There were significant positive
correlations between miR-143 level and
SOFA score (r ¼ 0.794, P < 0.01), and
miR-143 level and APACHE II score
(r ¼ 0.825, P < 0.01).
The AUC of the ROC for miR-143 was
0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.95; Figure 2), higher

Discussion
Circulating levels of several miRs, including
miR-146a and miR-15a, may assist in the
differential diagnosis of sepsis and SIRS.12,14
In addition, serum miR-574-5p and miR-
133a are prognostic predictors in sepsis,13,22
and serum miR-122 is associated with
coagulation disorders in sepsis.23 Levels of
miR-25 are related to SOFA score and
oxidative stress in patients with sepsis.24
Serum miR-143 levels were increased in
both patients with sepsis and those with
SIRS compared with normal controls in the
present study. More importantly, miR-143
levels could distinguish between sepsis and
SIRS. High levels of miR-143 were posi-
tively correlated with SOFA and APACHE
II scores. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to analyse serum miR-143 levels and
their diagnostic value in sepsis.
There is a known association between
miR-143 and the human immune
response.16 In addition, miR-143 has been
shown to regulate the anti-inflammatory
effect of mesenchymal stem cells and may
therefore be a potential therapeutic target.25
Functional studies of miR-143 have largely
focused on its role in carcinogenesis and
cancer progression, and little is known
about its effect on the immune response.
It is therefore important to identify more
miR-143 target genes in order to clarify its
role in immunoregulation.
The present study has several limitations,
including the retrospective design and rela-
tively small sample size. In addition, we did
not evaluate the source or mechanism(s) of
action of miR-143 during sepsis, nor whether
a combination of miR-143 and other bio-
markers might be more practical in the
differential diagnosis of sepsis and SIRS.
In conclusion, serum miR-143 is elevated
in patients with sepsis, and may be a useful
biomarker for distinguishing between sepsis
