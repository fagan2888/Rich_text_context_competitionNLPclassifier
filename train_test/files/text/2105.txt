Abstract
Background: To date, the great majority of Russian HIV infections have been diagnosed among IDUs and
concerns about the potential for a sexual transmission of HIV beyond the IDU population have increased. This
study investigated differences in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors between IDUs and non-IDUs in St.
Petersburg, Russia and assessed associations between substance use patterns and sexual risks within and between
those two groups.
Methods: Cross-sectional survey data and biological test results from 331 IDUs and 65 non-IDUs who have IDU sex
partners were analyzed. Multivariate regression was employed to calculate measures of associations.
Results: IDUs were less likely than non-IDUs to report multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex with casual
partners. The quantity, frequency and intensity of alcohol use did not differ between IDUs and non-IDUs, but non-
IDUs were more likely to engage in alcohol use categorized as risky per the alcohol use disorders identification test
(AUDIT-C). Risky sexual practices were independently associated with monthly methamphetamine injection among
IDUs and with risky alcohol use among non-IDUs. Having sex when high on alcohol or drugs was associated with
unprotected sex only among IDUs.
Conclusions: Greater prevalence of sexual risk among non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners compared to IDUs
suggests the potential for sexual transmission of HIV from the high-prevalence IDU population into the general
population. HIV prevention programs among IDUs in St. Petersburg owe special attention to risky alcohol use
among non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners and the propensity of IDUs to have sex when high on alcohol or
drugs and forgo condoms.
Background
To date the great majority of Russian HIV infections
and AIDS cases have been diagnosed among injection
drug users (IDUs) {Population Reference Bureau, 2007
#574; Shaboltas, 2006 #384; Kozlov, 2006 #385} and pre-
vious research indicates that drug injection is markedly
more prevalent than a decade ago [4]. In Russia and
elsewhere in the former Soviet states, the drugs most
commonly injected are heroin and ephedrine derivates,
including methamphetamine [5-7]. Both categories of
drugs have been independently associated with sexual
practices that risk HIV transmission or acquisition
[6,8,9]. In addition, alcohol consumption in Russia has
substantially increased in the turbulent years following
the collapse of the Soviet Union [10,11] and is report-
edly among the highest in the world [12]. Heavy alcohol
consumption, which is prevalent among IDUs in Russia,
has been associated with sexual risk-taking and injection
practices that facilitate HIV transmission [13,14].

Heavy use of illicit injectable drugs and alcohol has
led to concerns about the potential for a sexual trans-
mission of HIV into the general population. There are
several factors that determine whether HIV transmission
will be limited to the core population of injectors in
which it is prevalent or if it will become a generalized
epidemic [15]. Among these are the size and activity
levels of the bridging population, which is comprised of
those who form partnerships with both IDUs and with
non-IDUs, and partnership formation patterns within
the general population [16,17]. Studies conducted
among Russian non-drug using youth indicate that in
recent years levels of unprotected sex have increased,
age of sexual debut has decreased, rates of partner
change have increased, and sexual activity under the
influence of alcohol has become more prevalent among
the general population, increasing the potential for the
transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
overall [18-20]. While HIV transmission-related beha-
vior is prevalent among Russian IDUs [21-23], it is not
known whether such behavior is more or less prevalent
among their non-IDU partners. In addition, while a
number of substance-use-related patterns have been
associated with sexual risk among Russian IDUs, asso-
ciation between sexual risk and substance use has not
been estimated for non-IDUs who have IDU sex
partners.
The current analysis was conducted using data from a
study in St. Petersburg that was part of a large multi-
site project, the Sexual Acquisition and Transmission of
HIV Cooperative Agreement Program (SATH-CAP)
[24]. The goal of SATH-CAP was to collect and analyze
data on sexual and drug use practices and other social,
environmental and biological factors that may influence
HIV transmission, from high-prevalence core popula-
tions, i.e. IDUs and men who have sex with men (MSM)
to the greater general populations of which they are
part. This analysis compared the sexual risk behaviors
and patterns of substance use between heterosexual
IDUs and non-IDUs who have IDU sexual partners with
the following aims: (1) to investigate whether substance
use measures in both groups differed in their correla-
tions with sexual risks, and (2) to determine whether
sexual risk behaviors are associated with global sub-
stance use levels and with substance use in sexual
contexts.
Methods
Study Population and Recruitment into the SATH-CAP
study
The SATH-CAP study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Yale University, the Bio-
medical Center in St. Petersburg, and RAND Corpora-
tion. Participants were recruited between November
2005 and December 2008 using a modified form of
respondent driven sampling (RDS) [24,25]. RDS is a
chain-referral sampling methodology that uses struc-
tured incentives and coupon disbursement procedures
for peer referrals. Conventional RDS methods were
modified [24] in this study to recruit both core members
(IDUs and MSM) and their sex partners whether they
were core members or not. Briefly, enrolled core mem-
bers were given coupons to distribute to their core
peers and to their sex partners. Potential participants
after they received coupons had to call to schedule an
appointment and to show up at the study site for elig-
ibility screening and enrollment. Newly enrolled cores
were in turn offered coupons to recruit additional core
peers and their own sexual partners. Participation was
confidential. No locator information was collected but a
number of bio-measures including forearm length and
wrist circumference were collected to prevent repeat
participation (duplicates).
Participants completed structured interviews and were
given pre-test counseling before biological specimens
were collected for the testing of sexually transmitted
infections, including HIV. Participants received incen-
tives including mobile phone cards and personal care
items; all received subway tokens, condoms and HIV
prevention information. Participants were instructed
when to return to the site to receive their laboratory
test results and post-test counseling. Participants were
referred for other medical services as needed.
Interview Data Collection
Interviews lasting 90-120 minutes were conducted using
computer-assisted survey interviewing technology on
laptop computers. Information was collected on socio-
demographics, health status and HIV-associated sexual
and injection risk behaviors. Socio-demographic items
included age, sex, marital status, education, employment
and source of income, housing and whether the partici-
pant considers him or herself homeless or had ever
been jailed. Self-reported health data included HIV test-
ing and results, illicit injection drug use (IDU) in the
last 6 months, the number of times injected in the last
month, whether the participant used methamphetamines
-including amphetamines or ephedrine-in the past
month, whether the participant used syringes or injec-
tion equipment that had been used by others for injec-
tion. Participants were asked three items from the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C)
instrument: frequency of alcohol use in the last month,
the usual number of alcoholic drinks consumed at each
drinking event, and frequency in which participant got
drunk or consumed five or more drinks in two hours in
the last month. Sexual behaviors in the six months prior
to interview included number of male and female sex

partners, number of sex partnerships of less than three
months duration, sex partnership type (i.e. main or non-
main), vaginal and anal sex with and without condoms
at the last sexual encounter with up to five of their
most recent sexual partners, and for each reported part-
nership, whether the participant or his or her partner
had been "high" on drugs or alcohol during one of their
sexual encounters.
STI Detection Assays
Blood and urine specimens were obtained from all parti-
cipants. Serum was tested for human immunodeficiency
virus type-1 (HIV-1) and syphilis. HIV-1 testing involved
two HIV-1 antibodies enzyme immunological assays
(EIAs) (Vironostika HIV-1, Uni-Form-II plus-0; Biomer-
ieux, Netherlands and Genscreeen HIV-1/2; BioRad,
France). Positive HIV-1 EIA tests were confirmed by
Western Blot (WB) (HIV-1 WB Type-1, Biorad, France).
Serum samples were screened for syphilis with rapid
plasma reagin test (RPR) (Macro-Vue RPR-Card Tests,
Becton Dickinson, USA) and Treponema pallidum parti-
cle agglutination assay (TPPA) (Serodia-TPPA, Fujirebio,
Japan). Specimens were seropositive for syphilis if results
of both tests were reactive. Urine specimens were tested
for nucleic acid from Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamy-
dia) and Neisseriae gonorrheae (gonorrhea) using poly-
merase chain reaction (Amplicor CT/NG, Roche, USA).
Hypotheses Testing and Data Analysis
This study investigated the prevalence of sexual risk
behaviors, non-viral STIs and substance use patterns
between IDUs and non-IDUs who have IDU sex part-
ners and tested three hypotheses: (1) that the prevalence
of STIs and the frequency of sexual risk behaviors
would be greater among IDUs than non-IDUs, (2) that
substance use measures that were correlated with sexual
risks would be different among IDUs and non-IDUs,
and (3) that both global patterns of substance use and
substance use in sexual contexts would be associated
with unprotected sex with casual partners among both
IDUs as well as among non-IDUs.
The criteria for inclusion into this analysis were: injec-
tion drug use in the last six months or having a sex
partner who is an IDU; testing negative for HIV or
being unaware of positive HIV status upon enrollment;
if male, reporting only sex with females; being sexually
active in the last six months; and providing data on sex-
ual partnerships. Because sexual partnership information
may have been duplicated when participants recruited
their own sexual partners into the study, sexual partner-
ships reported by recruits with his or her recruiter were
excluded from the analysis. Thus participants were
excluded from the analysis if their only reported sex
partner was his or her recruiter.
Three dimensions of HIV-related sexual risks served
as separate outcomes: (1) reporting more than one sex
partner in the prior six months, i.e. multiple sex part-
ners, (2) reporting unprotected sex with casual partners,
i.e. with non-main or new (< 3 months) sex partners,
and (3), testing positive for a non-viral STI (N. gonor-
rheae, C. trachomatis and/or syphilis serology). We
chose non-viral STIs as an outcome because these STIs
represent recent sexual risk taking [26] and since they
are not transmitted through sharing injection equipment
they are suitable markers for the comparison of sexual
risks between IDUs and non-IDUs.
Risky alcohol use corresponded to AUDIT-C scores
greater than three for males and greater than two for
females based on answers to the first three AUDIT
questions as determined in previous studies [27-29].
Unsafe injection was defined as using syringes or equip-
ment that had been already used by another IDU. Hav-
ing sex when high on drugs or alcohol referred to
participants who reported having sex while he/she or
any partner was drunk or "high" on drugs.
All analyses were performed using Stata for Macintosh
version 10. Descriptive statistics were used to compare,
between IDUs and non-IDUs, the prevalence of demo-
graphic, socio-economic measures, sexual behavior and
non-viral STIs, alcohol consumption patterns including
AUDIT-C scores, and having sex when high on drugs or
alcohol. Methamphetamine use was assessed for both
IDUs and non-IDUs. For IDUs, descriptive statistics
included injection frequency and unsafe injection. Dif-
ferences between IDUs and non-IDUs were assessed
using Chi-square tests, or for non-normally distributed
continuous variables, Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were
conducted for all participants who fit inclusion criteria,
and for IDUs and non-IDUs separately. Logistic regres-
sion was employed to assess bivariate associations of the
three selected sexual risk behavior outcomes (multiple
sex partners, unprotected sex, and a positive test for a
non-viral STI) with the demographic and substance use
related factors. Multivariate logistic regression was con-
ducted to produce unconfounded estimates of associa-
tions between each of the above outcomes and
demographic and substance-use patterns. Multivariate
models were constructed by including all covariates that
were statistically significant at alpha level 0.2 in the
bivariate analysis and gradually removing each non-sig-
nificant covariate until all covariates were statistically
significant (p < 0.05) or removal did not change adjusted
odds ratio point estimates by > 10%. Because measures
of injection frequency and unsafe injection were relevant
for IDUs but not for non-IDUs, associations between
those covariates and outcomes were assessed for IDUs
but not for non-IDUs. Similarly, injection drug in the

prior six months was relevant only in models that
included both IDUs and non-IDUs. Thus, multivariate
models inclusive of all participants and those stratified
by IDU status, had the potential to include overlapping,
but slightly different subsets of covariates.
Since participants could report more than one sexual
partner, we analyzed the risks factors related to condom
use at last intercourse within each sexual partnership
using generalized estimating equations (GEE).
Interactions between drug injection in the prior 6
months and three substance use related variables: at-risk
AUDIT-C score, methamphetamine use, and having sex
when high on drugs or alcohol were investigated. Inter-
action terms between drug injection and each substance
use related variable were created separately, added one
by one to the models, and compared with main effect
models using likelihood-ratio tests. Risk factors were
considered to be significantly different between IDUs
and non-IDUs when an interaction term was significant
after being added to the main effects model and the
likelihood-ratio test confirmed its improvement of the
overall fit of the model.
Results
General Characteristics of Subjects
In all, 1,023 IDUs, MSM and their sexual partners were
recruited into the completed SATH-CAP study in St.
Petersburg. After excluding HIV-infected participants
who were aware of being HIV positive (146), were MSM
(242), reported zero sex partners (57), did not report
number of sex partners in the prior six months (93), did
not answer questions about sexual partnerships (29) and
had as their only sex partner the participant who
recruited them into the study (60), 396 participants
were included in the analysis. These included 84% (331/
396) who reported IDU in the prior six months and
16% (65/396) who did not (Table 1). Among all partici-
pants included in this analysis, 68% (269/396) were
male; age ranged from 18 to 53 years with a median of
28 years (IQR = 24-32). IDUs were more likely to be
older (Table 1), male, married, have uncompleted post-
secondary education, be unemployed, live with family,
report no legal income, and have been incarcerated.
Sexual Behavior and STI Outcomes
In bivariate analysis, non-IDUs were significantly more
likely than IDUs to report having had multiple sex part-
ners, casual partners, and unprotected sex at last inter-
course with casual partners, i.e. with new (< 30 days) or
non-main partners. IDUs were more likely than non-
IDUs to report having sex while the participant, his or
her partner, or both were drunk or high (i.e. having sex
when high on drugs or alcohol) (Table 1).
The prevalence of non-viral STIs was low and did not
significantly differ between IDUs and non-IDUs. Among
IDUs, the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea and
syphilis serology was 4% (14/331), 1% (4/331) and 1%
(3/331), respectively. Two participants were co-infected
with chlamydia and gonorrhea. Among non-IDUs, the
prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis serology
was 9% (6/65), 2% (1/65) and 0%, respectively; there
were no co-infections. Non-viral STI prevalence did not
differ by gender, but prevalence was too low for the ana-
lysis to have any statistical power.
Substance Use
Among IDUs who reported the types of drugs used in
the last month, the drug most frequently used was her-
oin or opiates at 84% followed by methamphetamine at
18%. Nearly all IDUs (99%) reported having taken opi-
ates and methamphetamine in the form of injection and
the use of other types of hard drugs was limited (< 7%).
A quarter (82/331) reported using syringes or equip-
ment that had been used by someone else. The median
monthly injection frequency was 20 (Table 1). Eleven
percent of non-IDUs reported consuming non-injectable
methamphetamine.
Non-IDUs were significantly more likely than IDUs to
receive at-risk AUDIT-C scores. However, the median
number of days they consumed alcohol per month, the
median number of drinks at each drinking event, and
the median number of days participants "got drunk" or
had > 4 drinks in two hours in the previous 30 days did
not significantly differ between IDUs and non-IDUs.
Correlates of Testing Positive for a Non-viral STI
Testing positive for a non-viral STI was independently
associated with younger age (aOR = 0.1; 95% C.I. 0.0-
0.6; p = 0.016) and with having multiple sex partners
(aOR = 2.7; 95% C.I. 1.1-6.4; p = 0.024). Among IDUs,
no variable was independently associated with non-viral
STI. Insufficient observations did not permit an analysis
among non-injectors.
Correlates of Having Multiple Sexual Partners
In multivariate logistic regressions using all eligible partici-
pants reporting multiple partnerships was independently
associated with being non-IDU, methamphetamine use,
and reporting sex when high on drugs or alcohol (Table
2). In analysis restricted to IDUs, reporting multiple sex
partners was independently associated with methampheta-
mine use and reporting sex when high on drugs or alco-
hol. Among non-IDUs, having multiple sex partners was
independently associated with having sex while high on
drugs or alcohol and marginally associated with risky alco-
hol use. The latter was retained in the multivariate model

for non-IDUs due to its removal changing the aOR for sex
while high by > 10%.
There was one significant interaction between drug
injection and having sex when high on drugs or alcohol
(p = 0.015). Having sex when high on drugs or alcohol
was significantly associated with having multiple sex
partners for both IDUs and non-IDUs. However, the
magnitude of the relationship between having sex
when high on drugs or alcohol and having multiple sex
partners was greater for non-IDUs compared to IDUs
(aOR = 10.7 vs. 1.8, respectively). No other interactions
were identified.
Correlates for Having Unprotected Sex
In multivariate logistic regression using all eligible parti-
cipants, unprotected sex in the last six months was
independently associated with being married, being a
non-IDU, methamphetamine use and having sex when
high on drugs or alcohol (Table 3). In analysis limited
to IDUs, unprotected sex was associated with being

married, using methamphetamine and having sex when
high on drugs or alcohol. Among non-IDUs, unpro-
tected sex was independently associated with risky
alcohol use.
There was a statistically significant interaction
between IDU and risky alcohol use (p = 0.009), in that
non-IDUs who engaged in risky drinking had 6.7 greater
odds of having unprotected sex than those who did not
engage in risky drinking whereas there was no such rela-
tionship for IDUs. No other interactions were statisti-
cally significant.
Correlates for Having Unprotected Sex within Sexual
Partnerships Reported by Participants
In an analysis conducted at the partnership level, GEE
was performed on 681 partnerships reported by the 396
IDUs and non-IDU participants. Having unprotected sex
was independently associated with being married, not
having a casual partner, methamphetamine use and hav-
ing sex when high on drugs or alcohol (Table 4). When
limited to the 541 partnerships reported by 331 IDUs,
unprotected sex was independently associated with being
married, not having a casual partner, methamphetamine

use, unsafe injection and having sex when high on drugs
or alcohol. In analysis of 140 sexual partnerships reported
by 65 non-IDUs, unprotected sex was associated with
older age.
Discussion
Contrary to the initial hypothesis, IDUs were signifi-
cantly less likely than non-IDUs who reported at least
one IDU sex partner to have multiple sex partners and
unprotected sex with casual partners. IDUs had fewer
partners even after controlling for methamphetamine
use, which was associated with higher number of sexual
partners. This contrasts with findings from other studies
that suggested that IDUs engaged in as much or more
[9,30] sexual risk behaviors compared to individuals
who did not inject.
IDUs were less likely than non-IDUs to engage in
risky drinking, and risky drinking was not independently
associated with sexual risk among IDUs. These results
contrast with studies showing alcohol consumption to
be greater among narcotic [31] or methamphetamine
users [8,32] and to be associated with sexual risk taking
among IDUs [33,34]. In a previous study, IDUs in Russia
reported consuming lesser quantities of alcohol than
IDUs in the United States [13]. Given that drug depen-
dence and alcoholism have been observed to be co-
occurring events in Russia [14] it is unclear whether the
lesser prevalence of risky drinking among IDUs is due
to a less risky alcohol consumption pattern or if it
results from our failure to identify some other type of
hazardous drinking that may occur in Russia [12]. It
could be argued that the lower levels of risky alcohol
use among IDUs could be due to underreporting as a
result of social desirability bias or stigma and discrimi-
nation against IDUs. However, alcohol use is widely
accepted in Russia and studies have shown that drinking
is often used as a facilitator of sex and as a symbol of
masculinity in the Russian culture [35]. In addition,
there was no significant difference in the reported fre-
quency of alcohol use between IDUs and non-IDUs in
this study, it was only the pattern of risky drinking that
significantly differed between the two groups. A possible
explanation for these results is that alcohol is often used
to remove pressure, relax and reduce stress whereas opi-
ates are much more powerful relaxants than alcohol
[35-39]. Since the majority of IDUs in this study injected
heroin, they may have had a lesser need to resort to
risky patterns of drinking in order to self-medicate [31]

compared to non-IDUs. Another possible explanation
for the lower levels of risky drinking among IDUs,
comes from data showing that a majority 95% of IDUs
in Russia are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [40]
and HCV infections often lead to liver diseases [41].
IDUs are also more likely to have HIV, to receive antire-
troviral therapy or to have co-morbid conditions leading
to poor health outcomes [42]. All of these factors could
lead to a reduction of tolerance among IDUs for heavy
patterns of drinking. The sedating effects of heroin and
poor health conditions among IDUs could also account
for the lower levels of sexual risk behaviors observed
among IDUs compared to non-IDUs. In addition, the
discrepancy between the two groups may be com-
pounded by the increase in sexual risks that result from
the greater risky alcohol use among non-IDUs [35].
Similar to previous findings, the present results show
methamphetamine use to be the strongest predictor of
having multiple sex partners and unprotected sex
among this sample of heterosexual IDUs [6,8,43,44],
while among non-IDUs, those sexual behaviors were
associated with risky alcohol use [20,45].
The greater likelihood of reporting sex while high on
drugs or alcohol among IDUs as well as among non-
IDUs who had multiple sex partners probably reflects the
greater amounts of substance use among IDUs and non-
IDUs who had multiple sex partners. Only IDUs were
more likely to forgo condom use when they had sex
when high on drugs or alcohol. Similar to other studies
of non-IDUs, the major risk factor associated with unpro-
tected sex was the participant's general (i.e. monthly) pat-
tern of risky drinking and not being drunk at the time of
sex [46]. Thus, programs to increase condom use among
IDUs need to address substance use patterns that occur
in the context of sex, while among non-IDUs, general
drinking patterns must be addressed [33].
No significant difference was observed in the sexual
risk behaviors according to participants' gender, either
overall or in the analysis stratified by drug use status
suggesting greater similarities rather than differences
between the sexual risks of men and women in this
study. Given that previous studies have shown substance
abusing women to be at greater risk for unsafe sex and
STIs than substance abusing men [47-49] and studies in
Russia have shown sex risk behaviors to be more likely
among substance abusing men than among substance
abusing women [35], it is also possible that subtle gen-
der differences exist but were not identified in this
study. Future research that takes into consideration
motivations for risk behaviors and self efficacy for risk
reduction might be able to provide further insight into
these results.
The prevalence of STIs other than HIV has important
epidemiologic implications given the propensity of STIs
to increase the likelihood of HIV transmission [50,51].
Overall, STI prevalence among non-IDUs was compar-
able to the STI prevalence from the general population
in St. Petersburg [52,53], and STI prevalence among
IDUs in this study was similar to the prevalence found
among IDUs in other countries [54,55]. The low STI
prevalence might reflect a trend of reduced STIs being
reported over the years in Russia [56-58]. The results
have implications for behavior intervention research.
The low STI prevalence may suggest that it may not be
feasible or cost effective to use STIs outcomes in pro-
jects to reduce risk behaviors among these groups. How-
ever, given that the STI prevalence among participants
is actually higher because other common STIs were not
tested in this study, given the great prevalence of sexual
risk behaviors among non-IDUs, and given that partici-
pants are part of vulnerable populations, efforts to
detect and treat STIs among these groups need to
continue.
This study had several limitations. Participants
recruited into this study were IDUs and non-IDUs who
reported at least one IDU sexual partner; results may
not apply to non-IDUs who have never had sex with an
IDU. Because the capacity of RDS to produce probability
samples is limited [59] the generalizability of these
results even within the sampled populations may also be
limited. Sex risk behaviors may relate to substance use
patterns; therefore, behaviors might have been different
if the proportions of heroin, methamphetamine and
alcohol users had been different. This study may have
recruited individuals who were more comfortable parti-
cipating in research projects rather than IDUs who were
harder to reach. Conversely, certain or all risk behaviors
may have been underreported due to social desirability
or other types of bias. Last, due to questionnaire design,
we could not investigate whether having sex when
"high" was a specific effect of alcohol or of another
drug, nor could we assess whether it was the participant,
his or her partner or both who were drunk or high
when sex occurred, nor could we assess the level at
which participant was "high". Missing of data resulted in
fewer observations in multivariate models which may
increase risk of type II error; further, if missing data did
not occur at random the potential for bias in ORs exists.
Conclusions
Greater prevalence of sexual risk behaviors among non-
IDUs who report partnerships with IDUs, compared to
IDUs themselves, suggests a potential mechanism for
spread of HIV beyond the IDU population. Interventions
to reduce HIV transmission should address alcohol con-
sumption among non-IDUs who report sexual partner-
ships with IDUs, and methamphetamine use and the
propensity of having sex when high among IDUs.
