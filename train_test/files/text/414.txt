OBJECTIVE -- Muscle-strengthening activities (MSAs) may increase insulin sensitivity,
thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship
between MSAs and insulin sensitivity among American adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data on 4,504 adults without
diabetes, aged 20­79 years, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 1999­2004 and had information on MSAs. Self-reported frequency (times/week) of
MSAs was grouped as low (1), moderate (1­2.9), or high (3). Insulin sensitivity was mea-
sured by the fasting quantitative insulin sensitivity check index  100 (QUICKI).
RESULTS -- After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, physical activity other than MSAs,
BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and daily total caloric intake, the mean values for
QUICKI by low, moderate, and high MSA were 33.6, 33.9, and 34.2, respectively (P for
linear trend  0.008) for men and 34.2, 34.6, 34.6, respectively (P for linear trend  0.009)
for women. Mean fasting insulin (picomols per liter) concentrations were 75.0, 68.9, and
65.9, respectively (P for linear trend  0.017) for men and 66.9, 63.3, 61.2, respectively (P
for linear trend  0.007) for women. There were no significant differences across MSA
groups for fasting glucose among men or women.
CONCLUSIONS -- MSA is independently associated with higher insulin sensitivity among
U.S. adults. Efforts to increase MSA may be a realistic, feasible, and effective method of reducing
insulin resistance among the U.S. population.

Studies (1,2) have demonstrated the
association of muscle-strengthening
activities (MSAs) with improved in-
sulin sensitivity and enhanced glycemic
control among people with type 2 diabe-
tes. These observations, along with the
recognized benefits of MSA in terms of
maintaining functional status and reduc-
ing the odds for other risk factors for
chronic disease, have led several organi-
zations to recommend MSAs at the level
of two or three times per week (3,4).
Despite this general agreement about
the value of strength training, experimen-
tal interventions have largely lasted only
3­6 months (3). Such interventions may
not reflect the patterns of MSAs typically
performed in the real world, and they may
not reveal its natural impact on risk of
diabetes or long-term outcomes, as would
be available from a population-based,
cross-sectional study in which partici-
pants report on their customary use of
MSAs.
In these analyses, we examine whether
MSAs and other lifestyle factors are inde-
pendently associated with insulin sensitiv-
ity among U.S. adults by using the U.S.
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study population and data sources
The NHANES, which is conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, is an ongoing representative survey
designed to measure the health and nutri-
tion status of the civilian noninstitution-
alized U.S. population. NHANES 1999­
2004 used a complex, multistage
probability sample. Data were collected
by household interviews and through
standardized physical examinations con-
ducted in mobile examination centers in
different locations around the U.S. (5).
Half of the participants were randomly as-
signed to the morning session of the mo-
bile examination center and asked to fast
from 8 to 24 h. In the 1999­2004 sur-
vey, the overall response rate was 82% for
those in the interviewed survey and 77%
for those in mobile examination center
examination. Informed consent was ob-
tained for all participants.
There were 5,554 participants, aged
20­79 years, who attended the morning
examination and who had fasted at least
8 h. We excluded women who were preg-
nant (n  318), participants who had
been diagnosed with diabetes (n  430),
participants with fasting glucose 7.0
mmol/l (n  180), participants who had
missing insulin or glucose measurement
(n  77), and those who were missing a
weight or height measurement (n  45).
The remaining 4,504 participants were
included in the analyses. Among this final
sample, median values of cotinine (men:
0.24 ng/ml, women: 0.06 ng/ml, n  41),
total kilocalories (kcal) of energy intake
(men: 2,502 kcal/day, women: 1,754
kcal/day, n  45), and alcohol consump-
tion (0 drinks/week, n  136) were used
to impute missing values for these vari-
ables, all of which were used in the analysis.
Measures of insulin sensitivity
Fasting plasma glucose and insulin con-
centrations were measured on partici-
pants who fasted from 8 to 24 h before
the examination. All insulin and glucose
assays were performed at the Diabetes Di-
agnostic Laboratory at the University of
Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. Fasting

plasma glucose was measured enzymati-
cally by the hexokinase method. Serum
insulin was measured by radioimmunoas-
say with the double-antibody batch
method. Details about these laboratory
procedures and quality control have been
previously published (6).
We measured insulin sensitivity us-
ing the quantitative insulin sensitivity
check index (QUICKI) percent (100/[log
fasting insulin {uU/ml}  log glucose
{mg/dl}]) or (100/[0.48  log fasting
insulin {pmol/l}  log glucose {mmol/l}])
(7), which largely reflects hepatic insulin
sensitivity and basal hepatic glucose pro-
duction (8). The higher the QUICKI value
the higher the predicted insulin sensitivity.
Physical activity
History of physical activity was obtained
by a questionnaire administered during
the home interview. The MSA level was
evaluated by asking, "Over the past 30
days, how often did you do any physical
activities designed to strengthen your
muscles such as lifting weights, push-ups,
or sit-ups? Include all such activities even
if you have mentioned them before."
The American Heart Association (3)
has recommended that resistance exercise
be done at least twice per week, and Sigal
et al. (4) recommend that resistance train-
ing be performed three times a week. Ac-
cordingly, we divided self-reported MSA
(times/week) into three groups: low (1),
moderate (1­2.9), and high (3), whose
associated medians were 0, 2, and 5
times/week, respectively.
Participants were also asked to report
the frequency and duration of moderate
and vigorous physical activity during the
past month, allowing for 51 anticipated
activities and other reported activities that
were not anticipated (9). MSAs such as
push-ups, sit-ups, weight lifting, and
wrestling were excluded from the list for
calculating physical activities other than
MSAs (non-MSAs) levels. Non-MSAs es-
timated metabolic cost in metabolic
equivalents (METs) were assigned ac-
cording to a standardized coding system
developed by Ainsworth et al. (10) and
was defined as the ratio of work metabolic
rate to standard resting metabolic rate.
We assigned MET codes of 4.5 and 7.0 for
moderate and vigorous activity, respec-
tively. One MET is equivalent to the oxy-
gen consumed during seated rest (3.5
ml of oxygen  kg1  min1. Individuals
who did not report any activity lasting at
least 10 min were classified as sedentary.
In those who reported any physical activ-
ity lasting at least 10 min, physical activity
was categorized into two groups based on
the median of the MET distribution: mod-
erate (14.4 MET  h/week) and high
(14.4 MET  h/week).
Other variables
Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the
concentration of nicotine in the blood,
and nicotine is highly specific for such
exposure. Cotinine is a major metabolite
of nicotine. Using their serum cotinine
concentrations (in ng/ml), we classified
participants in four groups: nonsmoker
(14), light smoker (14­99), moderate
smoker (100­199), and heavy smoker
(200) (11).
The data on daily intake obtained by
interview were used to estimate total in-
take of energy, nutrients, and nonnutrient
food and beverages that were consumed
during the 24 h before the interview on
any day of a week. Drinking levels were
categorized by weekly drinks (non-
drinker, 1; moderate drinker, 1­7; and
heavy drinker, 8). A drink was defined
as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or
1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits
(12). Daily intake of calories was divided
into rounded tertiles with cut points of
2,000 and 3,000 for men and 1,500 and
2,000 for women.
Weight with minimal clothing (on a
digital electronic scale) was measured.
Standing height is measured with a fixed
stadiometer with a vertical backboard and
a moveable headboard. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters and was
used to measure obesity (three groups).
Waist circumference was measured just
above the uppermost lateral border of the
ilium to provide sex-specific tertiles (cut
points for men: 92.1 and 103.3 cm; for
women: 83.8 and 96.8 cm). Because BMI
is more widely used as an index for mea-
surement of obesity and may affect sub-
jects' MSA behavior more than waist
circumference does, BMI was used in
most of our multivariate analyses. Age (in
years) was categorized as 20­39, 40­59,
or 60­79 in multivariate analyses. Race/
ethnicity was divided into three groups:
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and others.
Statistical analysis
SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC)
was used for data management. Statistical
analyses were performed with SAS-
Callable SUDAAN software (version
9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC) to obtain point
estimates and SEs applicable to the U.S.
population. We applied fasting sample
weights to the data that indicated the in-
verse of the probability of being sampled.
Linear regression models were used as
primary analyses. Adjustment was made
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, non-MSA,
smoking and alcohol consumption, and
BMI groups in the multivariate regression
model. There were no significant interac-
tions between MSAs and the other covari-
ates included in the multivariate analysis
(all P values 0.05) except between
MSAs and sex on QUICKI, fasting insulin,
and fasting plasma glucose (all P values
for interaction terms 0.001). In light of
the interaction between MSAs and sex on
dependent variables, as well as the major
biological and lifestyle differences be-
tween men and women, most analyses
were stratified by sex.
RESULTS -- Of 4,504 study partici-
pants, aged 20­79 years, 84.7% per-
formed MSAs less than three times per
week, and 76.9% performed MSAs less
than once a week. The latter prevalence
(less than once a week) increased to
83.0% among subjects aged 60 years.
The average age of subjects included in
this analysis was 44 years, and 48.9%
were men. Descriptive and other charac-
teristics for the study sample are shown in
Table 1 by MSA category. Participants
who performed MSAs less than one time
per week were older, more likely to be
people without physical activities other
than MSAs, and to be heavy smokers.
Women who performed MSAs less than
one time per week tended to have a higher
BMI than other groups. Higher MSA was
related to higher insulin sensitivity, lower
fasting insulin, and lower fasting glucose.
After adjustment for age and race/
ethnicity, MSA was positively related to
higher insulin sensitivity (Table 2). Mean
levels of QUICKI among subjects with
lower, moderate, and high MSA were
33.5, 34.1, and 34.4, respectively (P for
linear trend 0.001) and 34.0, 35.0, and
35.3, respectively, for women (P for linear
trend 0.001). The association between
higher MSA and lower QUICKI was influ-
enced more by lower insulin levels than
glucose levels. As expected, higher BMI
was strongly related to lower insulin sen-
sitivity and higher fasting insulin and fast-
ing glucose concentrations. Moderate and
heavy smokers tended to have higher in-
sulin sensitivity than nonsmokers (P 
0.05). Being a moderate drinker was as-

To more fully evaluate the relation-
ship of MSA with insulin sensitivity, fast-
ing insulin, and fasting glucose, we
calculated multivariate-adjusted means
(Table 3). After adjustment for age, lei-
sure-time non-MSAs, race/ethnicity, BMI,
smoking status, alcohol consumption,
and daily total caloric intake, MSA levels
were positively associated with insulin
sensitivity in both men and women.
Higher MSA was also associated with
lower fasting insulin. The statistically sig-
nificant contrasts were mainly found be-
tween the highest and lowest MSA groups
but not between referent and mid-
categories. The P values of the linear trend
test of QUICKI and fasting insulin by
MSA were 0.008 and 0.017, respectively,
among men and 0.009 and 0.007, respec-
tively, among women. There was no evi-
dence of a significant association between
MSA and fasting glucose. BMI was
strongly and negatively associated with
QUICKI and positively associated with
fasting insulin and fasting glucose. In
men, age and daily total caloric intake
were significantly and negatively associ-
ated with insulin sensitivity. The associa-
tion of smoking with insulin sensitivity
was still present in men in this multivari-
ate model.
In additional multivariate analyses,
we adjusted for waist circumference ex-
pressed as sex-specific tertiles along with
non-MSA, age-group, race/ethnicity,
smoking status, alcohol consumption,
and daily total caloric intake. The result-
ing adjusted means of QUICKI for low,
moderate, and high MSA groups were
33.6 (referent), 33.8 (P value  0.317),
and 34.0 (P value  0.059) (P for linear
trend  0.128), respectively, among men
and 34.2 (referent), 34.7 (P value 
0.004), and 34.7 (P value  0.013) (P for
linear trend  0.002), respectively,
among women.
CONCLUSIONS -- MSAs have im-
portant implications for health. Resis-
tance training, which is the most effective
method for developing musculoskeletal
strength (13), is correlated with an indi-
vidual's physical function (14) and is par-
ticularly appropriate among older adults
with low cardiorespiratory function
(15,16). Given the safety and acceptabil-
ity of MSAs, it is disappointing that we
have confirmed a low prevalence of MSA
with our nationally representative sample
of nondiabetic U.S. adults aged 20­79
years (17). We found that MSAs were as-
sociated with higher insulin sensitivity as
evaluated by QUICKI and lower fasting
insulin among U.S. adults in the age range
we analyzed. Moreover, this association
was independent of non-MSAs and actu-
ally stronger in magnitude than the asso-
ciation between non-MSAs and insulin
sensitivity.
Most of the previously reported stud-
ies of MSAs and insulin sensitivity were
performed among selected subpopula-
tions evaluated after a few months of
structured training (18,19). In these stud-
ies, the benefits of MSA plateau during
subsequent months, particularly if the ex-
ercise training program did not contain
adequate variation (20). In contrast, our
population-based study provides a per-
spective on the role of habitual resistance
exercise in natural settings.
There have been reports that suggest
potential physiologic mechanisms by
which MSAs are related to high insulin
sensitivity (3). In an early report, Miller et
al. (18) showed that the increased muscle
mass resulting from strength training was
responsible for the attenuated insulin re-
sponse to a standard 100-g oral glucose
challenge in men. Others, however, have
suggested that the effect of training is not
caused solely by an increase in muscle
mass and is likely also influenced by ef-
fects on peak aerobic and maximal work-
ing capacity (e.g., VO2max
) (21). In a
population of older men, 9 weeks of high-
intensity resistance training of the legs fol-
lowed by 9 weeks of aerobic training on a
cycle ergometer resulted in changes in
both the VO2max
and the size of the capil-
lary-fiber interface that were similar to
those obtained from 18 weeks of aerobic
training on the ergometer. In another
study, the number of capillaries per
length of fiber perimeter was increased
after both resistance and aerobic training
in men aged 65­74 years, paralleling the
changes in VO2max
, and there was a signif-
icant positive correlation between the
change in capillary supply and VO2max
(22). In brief, the mechanisms behind the
effect of strength training seem similar to
those seen with aerobic training, even
though MSAs mainly recruit type II mus-
cle (fast-twitch fibers), especially type IIb
fibers, that are less sensitive to insulin
than type I muscle (slow-twitch fibers)
(23).
Other studies, however, have demon-
strated that without altering VO2max
, resis-
tance training improves insulin sensitivity
in patients with diabetes (24) and can re-
duce risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease (25). After 6 weeks of one-legged
resistance training performed three times
per week, 10 men with diabetes and 7
men without diabetes had produced (in-
dependent of increased muscle mass) in-
creased protein content of GLUT4,
insulin receptor, protein kinase B-/,
glycogen synthase, and glycogen synthase
total activity (26).

Muscle-strengthening activity and insulin sensitivity
2268 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 30, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2007
In our study, the relation of MSAs and
QUICKI among men was attenuated after
adjusting for tertiles of waist circumfer-
ence but did not change significantly after
adjustment for BMI. This finding sup-
ports previous research (27) that waist
circumference may account for 40% of
the variance in insulin action. Hence, we
propose that MSAs may be a potentially
beneficial health behavior for which the
relationship with insulin sensitivity may
be reflected through reductions in waist
circumference. We also propose that
identifying the precise mechanism of
MSA's influence on insulin sensitivity is
worthy of further exploration.
Structured aerobic training has been
related to the treatment and prevention of
insulin resistance (28). We found initially
that non-MSA was associated with higher
insulin sensitivity and with lower concen-
trations of fasting insulin and fasting glu-
cose, especially among women (Table 2).
For both sexes, however, these statistical
associations disappeared following ad-
justment for MSA levels. In this study,
non-MSA is not equal to aerobic physical
activity. The lack of an association may
also be related to the use of absolute MET
values for categorizing activity into mod-
erate or vigorous activity.
Findings on the relationship between
smoking and insulin sensitivity and dia-
betes are controversial (29,30). Our re-
sults showed that the relation of smoking
to insulin sensitivity tends to be J shaped
(Table 2). However, it is possible that
smoking may damage not only pulmo-
nary cells but also pancreatic cells (31),
which will give the incorrect estimation of
insulin sensitivity by using QUICKI.
Overweight and obesity, as measured
by BMI, were negatively related to insulin
sensitivity, a relationship that has been
well defined by many studies (32).
Weight loss reduces the lipid content of
skeletal muscle in morbidly obese indi-
viduals, which may contribute to the im-
provement of insulin action (33). Our
study supports the notion that physical
activity and body weight are indepen-
dently related to insulin sensitivity (34).
Regarding consumption of alcohol, as did
a study among women aged 64 years (35),
we found that moderate drinking was re-
lated to higher insulin sensitivity and
lower concentrations of insulin. In addi-
tion, our cross-sectional study found a
statistically significant association in men
between lower intake of energy and
higher insulin sensitivity (after adjusting
for other variables, P  0.024); this asso-
ciation was attenuated among women.
These findings were consistent with those
of Weiss et al. (36), who found that ca-
loric restriction improved glucose toler-
ance and insulin action among nonobese,
healthy men and women aged 50­60
years in a 12-month randomized trial. In
contrast, Joseph et al. (37) found that 4
weeks of energy restriction did not im-
prove insulin sensitivity among women
aged 63 years.
This is the first large study to examine
how insulin sensitivity is associated with
levels of MSAs as they are performed
among the U.S. public. While our study
had good data quality, was well designed,
and was intensively controlled and evalu-
ated, it still had a few limitations. With the
data available, we were able to perform
only a cross-sectional analysis of the pop-
ulation, which limits our understanding
of the cause-and-effect relationship be-
tween the variables we evaluated. In ad-
dition, we lacked direct measurements of
peripheral insulin sensitivity. We thus re-
lied on QUICKI, which is derived from
fasting glucose and insulin concentra-
tions and reflects primarily hepatic insu-
lin sensitivity and basal hepatic glucose
production (7,8). Hepatic insulin resis-
tance, however, correlates strongly with
peripheral (muscle) insulin resistance
(38). Although the NHANES computer-
ized interview used the multipass
method, the reliability and validity of self-
reported physical activity and daily total
caloric intake in NHANES have not been
reported. The physical activity question-
naire covered the previous month, and
the nutrition questionnaire only covered
the previous 24 h. The information pro-
vided by these questionnaires, therefore,
might not represent the participants' rou-
tine lifestyle over a longer time interval.
We lacked information on the intensity
and duration of MSAs. The intensity with
which the general population exercises
may be lower than that prescribed in trials
of muscular training, and therefore our
analysis might underestimate the rela-
tionship between MSAs and insulin sen-
sitivity. The use of medications such as
insulin, metformin, or thiazolidinediones
might modify the associations between
MSAs and body composition or insulin
sensitivity, but our analytical sample is
unlikely to include participants using
these drugs because we excluded people
with diabetes. In an extra analysis, adjust-
ing for estrogen and progestin use among
nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women,
the average QUICKI values were 34.1,
34.5, and 34.6 (P for linear trend 
0.007), the average fasting insulin (in
pmol/l) were 67.2, 63.5, and 61.6 (P for
linear trend  0.008), and the average
fasting glucose (in mmol/l) were 5.20,
5.17, and 5.16 (P for linear trend 
0.521) among women with low, moder-
ate, and high MSA, respectively. Regard-
less, most studies of MSAs and insulin
sensitivity have been based on small clin-
ical trials and involved small samples of
people with diabetes. We have not found
any such studies on general populations
without diabetes.
In summary, this cross-sectional
study found that MSAs are related to
higher insulin sensitivity among U.S.
adults in a manner that is independent of
age, race/ethnicity, non-MSA, BMI,
smoking, alcohol consumption, and total
energy intake. MSAs may be a realistic
and effective way to prevent diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.
