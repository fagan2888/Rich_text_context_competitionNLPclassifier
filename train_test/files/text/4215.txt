Introduction
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing
inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of
unknown etiology. In children and adolescents,
CD is especially insidious because of the negative
influence of pathological inflammation in the
small bowel (SB) on nutrition, resulting in
growth and development retardation.1 Most
patients with CD have some extent of SB engage-
ment and up to one third suffer from inflamma-
tion limited to the SB.2,3 Moreover, the onset of
CD is located in the SB in more than 20% of
pediatric patients.4,5 However, these estimates
are somewhat uncertain because they are based
on outdated methods to examine the SB, which
might have underestimated the extent of inflam-
mation in the SB. One important question is
whether information about more proximal SB
disease in addition to what is observed using
standard endoscopic and imaging evaluations
would change therapeutic strategies.

Abstract
Background: Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive method enabling excellent
visualization of the small bowel (SB) mucosa. The aim of this study was to examine the impact
and safety of VCE performed in children and adolescents with suspected or established
Crohn's disease (CD).
Methods: A total of 180 VCE examinations in 169 consecutive patients conducted in 2003­14
in a single center were retrospectively analyzed. The median age was 13 years (range 3­17
years) and indications for VCE were suspected (125 cases, 69%) and established (55 cases,
31%) CD. VCE was performed with a PillCam SB (Given Imaging, Yokneam, Israel) VCE system
with 8­12 h of registration without bowel preparation.
Results: A total of 154 of 180 (86%) patients swallowed the capsule and 26 (14%) had the
capsule endoscopically placed in the duodenum. Patency capsule examination was performed
in 71 cases prior to VCE to exclude SB obstruction. VCE detected findings consistent with SB
CD in 71 (40%) examinations and 17 (9%) procedures showed minor changes not diagnostic for
CD. A total of 92 (51%) examinations displayed normal SB mucosa. The capsule did not reach
the colon within the recording time in 30 (17%) procedures and were defined as incomplete
examinations. A change in diagnosis or therapy was recommended in 56 (31%) patients based
on VCE results. Capsule retention occurred in one patient.
Conclusions: VCE is a safe method in children with suspected or established CD. VCE often
leads to a definitive diagnosis and has a significant impact on the clinical management of
pediatric patients with CD.

Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive
method enabling excellent visualization of the SB
mucosa.6­8 In fact, since its introduction in 2001,
VCE has become the preferred method for evalu-
ation of obscure GI bleeding, tumors and inflam-
mation in the SB.9­13 Several studies have
documented that VCE effectively detects CD in
adult patients. For example, one study reported
20% increased diagnostic yield of SB CD lesions
compared with ileoscopy14 and another investiga-
tion showed that VCE is superior in detecting
mucosal lesions compared with magnetic reso-
nance enterography (MRE).15 However, the
impact of VCE on the clinical management of
pediatric patients with CD has not been evalu-
ated in large single-center studies.16 Thus, the
aim of this study was to examine the impact and
safety of VCE performed in children and adoles-
cents being investigated for suspected and estab-
lished CD in a large sample of patients from one
tertiary center for pediatric VCE.
Materials and methods
Patients
This retrospective study evaluated all consecutive
pediatric patients with suspected or known CD
undergoing VCE from October 2003 to December
2014 at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö,
Sweden. All patients gave written informed con-
sent prior to VCE examinations. The study was
conducted in accordance with the ethical princi-
ples of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study
was approved by the Ethical Committee of Lund
University, Sweden (582/2006, 412/2016). The
medical records of patients were analyzed by an
experienced gastroenterologist before VCE to
identify patients with potential SB obstruction.
Patients with suspected SB stricture underwent
patency capsule (PC) examination. In the case of
SB patency, patients continued with VCE.
Patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs within a period of 6 months before
VCE were excluded.
Video capsule endoscopy
VCE examinations were performed with the
PillCam SB1, SB2 and SB3 VCE system (Given
Imaging Ltd, Yokneam, Israel) after an 8 h fast
without any bowel preparation. After swallowing
the capsule, patients were allowed clear liquids
after 2 h and solid food after 4 h. If a patient was
not able to swallow the capsule the VCE delivery
device (AdvanCE, US Endoscopy, Mentor, OH,
USA) or the Roth Net retrieval device (US
Endoscopy) was used for capsule deployment via
a gastroscope in the duodenum. All VCE exami-
nations were evaluated by one of four gastroen-
terologists having experience with VCE. No
further controls were done if the video showed
capsule passage to the colon. An abdominal x-ray
film was recommended 2 weeks after VCE if the
video did now show capsule passage to the colon
or if the patient did not observe natural passage of
the capsule.
Patency capsule
PC examinations were performed using a first- or
a second-generation PC. A PC test was consid-
ered negative if the capsule was eliminated from
the GI tract within 40 h (first-generation PC) or
30 h (second-generation PC) from ingestion
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Elimination of the PC was confirmed using a
handheld scanner.
Definitions
Patients referred for VCE with symptoms of
abdominal pain or diarrhea were categorized as
having suspected CD if they fulfilled the
International Conference on Capsule Endoscopy
(ICCE) criteria, or if their referring physician
suspected CD.17 Patients were diagnosed as hav-
ing CD if they were treated for CD on the basis
of their symptoms and additional objective find-
ings. VCE consistent with CD was defined as
the presence of more than three erosions and
ulcerations in the SB while three or fewer SB
lesions was defined as suspected but not diag-
nostic for CD.18
Results
A total of 180 VCE examinations were performed
in 169 consecutive patients. Patients had a
median age of 13 years with a range from 3 to 17
years. Twenty-three (13%) patients were younger
than 10 years. A majority of patients (154, 86%)
swallowed the capsule and 26 (14%) had it deliv-
ered endoscopically into the duodenum. The
median age of patients requiring endoscopic
placement of the capsule was 9 years while those
who swallowed the capsule were on average 14
years old. In 30 of 180 (17%) procedures the
A Nemeth, D Agardh et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3
capsule did not reach the colon during the
recording time and were defined as incomplete
examinations, as shown in Table 1. Of these
incomplete cases, 11 (37%) capsules were placed
endoscopically into the duodenum. Findings
consistent with CD were found in 13 (43%) of
the 30 incomplete studies. The capsule showed
SB mucosa for more than 7 h (range 3­11 h) in
incomplete procedures. The majority of patients
with incomplete examinations swallowed the
SB1 capsule, with 20 (67%) cases having only
8 h of recording time, while 8 (27%) incomplete
procedures were conducted with the SB2 capsule
having a maximum of 9 h of recording time. Only
2 of 30 incomplete studies (7%) were performed
with the SB3 capsule, which has 12 h of record-
ing time and these two capsules had been endo-
scopically placed in the duodenum.
Indications for VCE were suspected CD in 125
(69%) cases and established CD in 55 (31%) pro-
cedures. VCE detected mucosal abnormalities in
98 (54%) examinations whereas SB findings were
observed in 88 (49%) studies. Seventy-one of
these 88 (81%) cases were consistent with CD
(Figure 1) and 17 (19%) procedures showed
minor changes not diagnostic for CD. A total of
92 (51%) studies displayed normal SB mucosa.
Colonic lesions were seen in 14 (8%) examina-
tions, including 10 cases in which no SB findings
were concomitantly detected. VCE showed previ-
ously unidentified lesions in the colon in three
studies. In patients with established CD, 44 of 55
(80%) examinations showed findings consistent
with SB CD, whereas 10 (18%) cases were nega-
tive and only a single patient had nonspecific
abnormalities. Twenty-nine of 55 (53%) proce-
dures identified CD lesions in the jejunum. In the
group of 125 suspected CD, a new diagnosis was
made in 30 (24%) patients and CD was excluded
in 79 (63%). Sixteen (13%) of these procedures
showed SB lesions suggestive but not diagnostic
for CD according to accepted criteria.18 The cap-
sule showed CD in the jejunum in 17 of the 125
(14%) suspected cases.
A new diagnosis or a change in therapy occurred
in 56 (31%) patients. Fifty-three patients had SB
findings and three had previously unidentified
CD lesions in the colon. We detected 71 cases
showing Crohn lesions in the SB, and as a result
of VCE findings, a change in therapeutic manage-
ment was recommended in 47 (66%) of these
patients with CD. Therapeutic changes included
intensification or initiation of anti-inflammatory
treatment in 43 (60%) patients; therapy was
decreased in 2 (3%) patients and 2 (3%) patients
refused recommended treatment. Biologic medi-
cation was started in 19 (27%) and immunomod-
ulatory treatment was initiated in 14 (20%) of
these 71 patients. Surgical intervention was not
suggested to any patient. The recommended
therapeutic changes based on VCE results are
described in detail in Table 2.
PC was used in 71 patients to identify those with
potential SB obstruction before VCE. In 33
(46%) patients, PC examination did not demon-
strate SB patency. In 14 (42%) of these cases,
radiological imaging was performed and showed
no SB stenosis but only 7 of these patients under-
went subsequent VCE. Radiological examination
showed SB stenosis in 8 (24%) cases and VCE
was not performed. Seven (21%) patients without
SB patency did not undergo further examina-
tions. In four additional patients, cross-sectional
imaging was not performed, but after repeated
evaluation of the patient's symptoms VCE was
offered. In 38 (54%) cases, SB patency was con-
firmed and VCE was performed. Patients with
endoscopic placement of the capsule and sus-
pected SB obstruction underwent MRE to prove
SB patency. We observed one case of capsule
retention in the GI tract. In this patient, the cap-
sule was retained within a metallic stent in the
sigmoid colon which had been inserted previously
to manage a CD stricture. The patient recovered
after sigmoid resection.

Discussion
It is generally accepted that VCE is the method of
choice to investigate SB mucosa in adults with
various indications, including CD.10,13,19 In this
large single-center retrospective pediatric cohort,
it was found that VCE is safe and has an impor-
tant impact on clinical management of pediatric
patients with suspected and established CD. Only
one case of capsule retention was noted, indicat-
ing that the procedure is safe in children at least
after 3 years of age. Moreover, nearly half of the
performed VCEs revealed abnormal intestinal
findings and resulted in changes in therapy in 6
out of 10 of these patients, which suggests a ben-
efit of performing an additional investigation with
VCE in children with potential SB disease.
Two previous large single-center pediatric studies
included patients up to 23 years and they did not
focus on the impact of VCE on management of
CD.7,20 All patients in our large European cohort
were under 18 years old. Herein, we found a 49%
detection rate of Crohn lesions in the SB, which is
similar to previous studies.8,20 Moreover, a major-
ity (81%) of the SB findings were diagnostic for
CD. At the same time, VCE excluded SB CD in
about 51% of the cases, which is of great impor-
tance for further management of CD. Most of the
children were able to swallow the capsule and the
capsule reached the colon during the recording
time in the majority of the examinations. The rate
of incomplete procedures (17%) compares well
with other studies, ranging from 21% to 23%.7,20,21
Notably, 42% of the capsules deployed endo-
scopically in the duodenum did not reach the
colon during recording time. The longer SB tran-
sit time might be related to the use of general
anesthesia and endoscopic placement of the cap-
sule in the incomplete studies.22 Nonetheless, the
SB was visualized in all incomplete studies.
Interestingly, CD was diagnosed more often
(43%) in patients with incomplete procedures
than those with complete examinations (38%),
indicating that incomplete VCE examinations do
not hamper diagnostic yield. The explanation
could be that in incomplete procedures the cap-
sule still spends on average more than 7 h exam-
ining SB even if not reaching the cecum during
recording time.
Although there is some evidence to prepare the
bowel prior to SB VCE, optimal bowel prepara-
tion is controversial.23 A current meta-analysis of
adult studies demonstrated that laxatives do not
improve diagnostic yield or completion rate in SB
VCE, although SB visualization is improved.
That meta-analysis concluded that the use of lax-
atives might be beneficial in patients likely to have
subtle findings.24 The only prospective pediatric
study to date supports the use of 25 ml/kg (up to
1000 ml/day) of polyethylene glycol solution plus
20 ml (376 mg) of oral simethicone as the prepa-
ration of choice for VCE. This study demon-
strated that despite improvement in mucosal
visualization, there was not a significant differ-
ence in the overall diagnostic yield between the
study groups.25 In our study, we performed VCE
without bowel preparation and SB cleanliness
grading because Crohn lesions in the SB are often
multiple and missing minor mucosal changes
does not affect diagnostic yield of VCE.
Furthermore, bowel preparation might increase
patient discomfort and decrease compliance in
children.
MRE examinations have a tendency to miss the
diagnosis of CD in the jejunum.26 In our study,
VCE showed significant inflammatory activity in
the jejunum in more than 25% of all examina-
tions, indicating the importance of VCE in the

workup of patients with CD. It should be empha-
sized that jejunal CD lesions were detected in
more than half of the patients with established
CD in our study.
Our study shows that VCE is a safe method in
pediatric patients with established and suspected
CD. In fact, we found a very low complication
frequency with a capsule retention rate of only
0.6% (one case), which is lower than that observed
in most other studies, ranging from 1.0% to
4.9%.7,20,21,27 This case of capsule retention was
special in the sense that the capsule was retained
in a metallic stent.28 Thus, previous stenting in
the GI tract should be taken into consideration
before performing VCE. Notably, we did not
observe any capsule retention in the SB, which is
in line with a previous prospective study of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease.29 The
use of PC in adults has been shown to decrease
the risk of capsule retention.30 In our sample,
46% of PC examinations did not suggest SB
patency. This high proportion could be explained
by the fact that elimination of PC was confirmed
using a handheld scanner and some of the PC
could have been in the colon at the time of scan-
ning. One study reported that use of PC is a use-
ful screening tool in adolescents,31 but it is
controversial whether younger children should
undergo PC examination because they cannot
swallow the PC and sedation solely for endo-
scopic deployment of PC is not recommended.32
At the same time, several studies have shown that
radiological SB imaging, such as barium SB fol-
low through, computed tomographic enteroclysis
and magnetic resonance enteroclysis does not
exclude SB stenosis.30,32 Our low capsule reten-
tion rate can be explained by careful patient selec-
tion with frequent use of PC in patients older
than 10 years.
Conclusion
This study in a large cohort of pediatric patients
demonstrates that VCE has a significant clinical
impact on the management of children and ado-
lescents with suspected and established CD.
Additionally, VCE was associated with an excep-
tionally low capsule retention rate in the GI tract.
