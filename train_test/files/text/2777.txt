Abstract
Background
Vertebral fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture among women, but
estimates of their prevalence and incidence during middle-age are limited. The develop-
ment of vertebral morphometry (VM) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) makes
it more feasible to measure VM in large, longitudinal, observational studies. We conducted
this study to: 1) contribute to the scant knowledge of the prevalence, incidence and risk fac-
tors for vertebral deformities in middle-aged women; and 2) to evaluate the performance of
DXA-based VM measurement in a large, community based sample.
Methods
The sample is derived from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a
multi-site, community-based, longitudinal cohort study of the MT. Using Hologic QDR
4500A instruments, we acquired initial VM measurements in 1446 women during calendar
years 2004­2007; in 2012­2013, a follow-up VM was obtained in 1108. Annually, lumbar
spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD) were measured and partici-
pant characteristics were assessed with standardized instruments. Multivariable logistic
regression models examined the relations between prevalent deformity and relevant char-
acteristics. Analyses of characteristics associated with prevalent deformity were restricted
to 824 women who had not taken bone active medications since SWAN baseline. We cal-
culated incident deformity per person year (PY) of observation, standardized to 1000 per-
son-years.
Results
The cranial portion of the VM image yielded the lowest proportions of readable vertebrae:
from T4 through T6, between 43% and 63% of vertebral bodies were evaluable. Greater

BMI was associated with fewer readable levels (B = -0.088, p<0.0001). In the baseline sam-
ple of 1446 women, the prevalence of vertebral deformity was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3, 4.1). The
relative odds of deformity increased by 61% per SD decrement in baseline LS BMD (p =
0.02) and were 67% greater per SD decrement in baseline FN BMD (p = 0.04). Odds of
prevalent deformity increased by 21% per year increment in age (p = 0.02). On average,
1108 women were followed for 6.8 years (SD 0.5 years, range 5.1­8.3 years) and we
observed an incidence of 1.98 vertebral deformities per 1000 PY. In the longitudinal sam-
ple, 628 participants had never used bone active medications; their vertebral deformity inci-
dence was 2.8 per 1000 PY.
Conclusion
Prevalence of vertebral deformity in SWAN participants aged 50­60 years was low and
lower bone density at the LS and FN was strongly related to greater risk of prevalent defor-
mity. Only about half of the vertebral levels between T4-T6 could be adequately imaged by
DXA. Greater BMI is associated with fewer readable vertebral levels.
Introduction
While vertebral fractures (VF) are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture that occur
during the female life course, relative frequencies of each type of osteoporotic fracture vary by
age[1,2] Roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of vertebral fractures do not result in acute pain,
making it difficult to obtain population-based estimates of VF prevalence and incidence chal-
lenging.[3,4] VF prevalence and incidence estimates require lumbar and thoracic X-rays, or
more recently, vertebral morphometry obtained with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA), which has the advantage of very low radiation dose.[5,6] In observationalstudies, the
term vertebral deformity, rather than fracture, is generally used to describe findings on X-rays
or DXA morphometric analyses­because of challenges inherent in knowing whether the find-
ing represents a vertebral fracture, an anatomic variant, or a gradual vertebral body shape
change over time[7]
The overall prevalence of vertebral deformities in women over the age of 50 years of age is
estimated at between 10% and 37%, but these averages are heavily influenced by deformity
rates in women aged 65 years and older.[8­16] The prevalence of vertebral deformities in
younger women, aged between 50 and 60 years, is substantively lower, at about 5%. However,
the numbers of women on which estimates in this younger age stratum are based is low, point-
ing to the need for more information about vertebral deformity during middle age.[8­13, 16]
A better understanding of the prevalence of vertebral deformity in mid-life women is rele-
vant to osteoporosis prevention efforts. Those with a prevalent deformity are about 5 times
more likely to sustain an incident deformity over the course of one year and are also at double
the risk of having other minimal-trauma fractures.[17] Asymptomatic vertebral deformities do
count as prior fragility fractures in the FRAX1 tool, the most commonly-used method of esti-
mating absolute risk of future fractures (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX). Vertebral deformities
were also enrollment criteria and a primary endpoint for most randomized trials of osteoporo-
sis therapies. Because the majority of vertebral fractures are asymptomatic, there is a growing
interest in clinical use of vertebral morphometry assessment as part of DXA measurement to
improve fracture risk stratification.[6] However, the cost-effectivenessof such a screening
strategy depends on the prevalence of vertebral deformity in the population and the effective-
ness of the screening assessment tool.

To contribute to the scant knowledge of the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for verte-
bral deformities in middle-aged women, and to gauge the performance of DXA-based VM
screening in large, community based sample, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
(SWAN) conducted a vertebral morphometrystudy, the primary aims of which were to: 1) esti-
mate prevalence and incidence of vertebral deformities in the SWAN sample; 2) explore
whether prevalence and incidence varied by selected characteristics such as age or bone mineral
density(BMD).
Methods
Study sample
The study sample is derived from the bone study component of the Study Women's Health
Across the Nation (SWAN) [Fig 1]. The parent study, SWAN, is a multi-site, community-based,
longitudinal cohort study of the MT.[18] SWAN eligibility criteria were: age at cohort between
42 and 52 years, intact uterus and at least one intact ovary, not using hormone therapy at the
start of SWAN, at least one menstrual period in the 3 months before screening, and self-identifi-
cation as a member of one of 5 eligible ethnic/racialgroups. SWAN participants were enrolled at
7 sites: Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Newark and Oakland (N = 3302). All
sites enrolled White women; Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and Pittsburgh enrolled Black women
and the remaining 3 sites enrolled Japanese, Hispanic and Chinese women, respectively. The
SWAN bone study took place at 5 sites (Chicago and Newark did not participate); thus, the maxi-
mum number of potential enrollees in the bone study was 2413. Of these, 2365 women enrolled
and 1430 remained in the bone cohort at SWAN follow-up visit 8, when the vertebral morphom-
etry initial assessment began. We acquired initial (prevalent) vertebral morphometrymeasure-
ments during SWAN follow-up visits 8 through 10 (calendar years 2004­2007); although
obtained over the course of 4 calendar years, all were baseline vertebral morphometryscans. To
assess incidence, we acquired a second vertebral morphometryscan during SWAN follow-up
visit 13 (2012­2013). Vertebral morphometrywas ascertainedwith Hologic QDR 4500A instru-
ments (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA). During visits 8 through 10, 1446 women had an initial,
usable, vertebral morphometryscan; this is the cross-sectionalsample. Of the baseline sample,
1108 (76%) had a usable follow-up exam; these women comprise the longitudinal sample.
Outcome
Lateral vertebral morphometryscans were read by a single expert research radiologist based at
Synarc, Inc., using the Genant semi-quantitative method (Synarc, Inc., San Francisco, CA).[5,19]
Starting with T4 and proceeding to L4, the radiologist first assessed whether each vertebral level
was evaluable; for evaluable levels, she assigned each level a semi-quantitative fracture grade (SQ
Grade); SQ grade is done by visual inspection,without direct vertebral measurement. Grade 0 is
normal, no deformity. Grade 1 is mildly deformed (approximately 20­25% reduction in anterior,
middle, and/or posterior height and a reduction of area 10­20%). Grade 2 is moderately deformed
(approximately 25­40% reduction in any height and a reduction in area 20­40%. Grade 3 is
severely deformed (approximately 40% reduction in any height and area). If a given vertebral
level could not be evaluated, the radiologist reported the reason(s) such as: level not in scan, poor
signal to noise ratio or overlying ribs (more than one reason could be cited for each level).
Participant Characteristics
Standardized questionnaires assessed the following characteristics, of interest: age (years), edu-
cation level (less than high school [HS], HS, more than HS, college, or more than college), self-

pausal [regular menses], early perimenopausal [menses within the prior 3 months but less pre-
dictable], late perimenopausal [at least 3 months but less than 12 consecutive months of

pausal [bilateral oophorectomy with our without hysterectomy prior to menopause], number
of months since final menstrual period (FMP [postmenopausal women only]), current hor-
mone therapy use (yes/no), or use of osteoporosis medication (yes/no). FMP date was the
month and year at which 12 months of amenorrhea commenced or the date of surgery in
the case of surgical menopause. We measured weight (kilograms) and height (meters) using
calibrated scales and stadiometers; body mass index (BMI, [weight in kilograms/(height in
meters) 2]) was calculated. Because vertebral morphometry baseline years varied, we drew
information about baseline characteristics from the SWAN visit at which the initial VM was

done. We used each participant's initial spine and femoral neck BMD (i.e., first one done in
SWAN) as the BMD exposures, to avoid false elevation of spine BMD values by vertebral defor-
mity. To define never-users of major bone active medications (hormone therapy or osteoporo-
sis medications) we considered all SWAN visits, from parent study baseline through the
second VM ascertainment visit.
Data Analysis
We computed the number of evaluable vertebral bodies at each spinal level. We employed sim-
ple linear regression to test whether the number of spinal levels visualized varied by BMI. Base-
line frequencies of vertebral deformities were tabulated by spinal level and by deformity grade;
un-evaluable levels were coded as no deformity present. We calculated the prevalence of any
vertebral deformity (SQ grade ! 1) as a proportion ([number of participants with any defor-
mity/ baseline sample size]Ã100); 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were computed. We estimated
prevalence for the entire sample and stratified by selected participant characteristics. For bivar-
iate analyses, tertile cut-points for BMI and BMD were defined separately for each racial group
because distributions of these characteristics differ greatly by ethnic/racial group.[20] Preva-
lence estimates by the presence or absence of each characteristic were compared using Chi-
square test or Fisher's exact test. We calculated incident deformity (any increase in SQ grade)
per person year (PY) of observation,standardized to 1000 person-years; we also computed
incidence rates stratified by age at baseline <55 years or !55 years. Among participants who
experienceda deformity, the exact date of deformity occurrence was unknowable; we therefore
censored their person-time at the midpoint of their observation period. We constructed multi-
variable regression models to examine the relations between prevalent deformity and BMD,
race, age, BMI, and MT stage; covariates were included a priori based on prior literature.
[1,2,21] We ran separate models for spine and femoral neck BMD. All analyses were done
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). P values less than or equal to 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant; we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.
Results
The VM baseline analytic sample consisted of 1446 women: 384 Black, 175 Chinese, 203 Japa-
nese and 684 White. At baseline, mean age was 54 years (standard deviation, [SD] 2.7 years)
and average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (SD, 6.8 kg/m2). The percentages of women who were premen-
opausal, early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, naturally menopausal, or surgically
postmenopausal were 1%, 15%, 9%, 64%, and 8% respectively;3% of the sample had an unde-
terminable menopause stage. At vertebral morphometry baseline, 10% of women were using
hormone therapy and 6% were taking a prescription medication for osteoporosis. Since the
beginning of SWAN, 39% had ever used hormones and 8% had ever used osteoporosis medica-
tions; 5% of women had ever used both hormones and osteoporosis medications.
As expected, the most cranial portion of the VM image produced the lowest proportions of
readable vertebrae: considering levels T4 through T6, between 43% and 63% of vertebral bodies
could be evaluated [Table 1]. The commonest reasons for unreadable levels were: level not in
scan, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and overlying ribs (data not shown). A greater amount of soft
tissue thickness deteriorates signal-to-noise ratio; congruently, simple linear regression demon-
strated that greater BMI was associated with lesser number of readable vertebral levels (B =
-0.088, p<0.0001). There were 51 prevalent vertebral deformities in 46 participants; 3 partici-
pants had 2 deformities and 1 had 3 deformities [Table 1]. Two-thirds of the deformities were
Grade 1. The vertebral levels most affected by prevalent deformities were T11 through L2.

In the entire vertebral morphometry baseline sample of 1446 women, there were 46 with a
vertebral deformity, resulting in a prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI, 2.3, 4.1). In the age range repre-
sented (49­62), prevalence estimates did not vary significantly by age greater than or less than
55 years (prevalence estimates 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively, p = 0.81).Bivariate analyses of char-
acteristics potentially associated with prevalent deformity were restricted to the sub-sample of
824 women who had not taken bone active medications since SWAN baseline (hormone ther-
apy and/or osteoporosis treatments). There were 27 women with a prevalent deformity in this
sub-group [Table 2]. There was a trend towards greater prevalence with older age (p = 0.06)
and longer time since FMP (0.09). Vertebral deformity also appeared to be least prevalent in
Black women, but there was not a statistically significant difference in prevalence among racial
groups (p = 0.63). In bivariate analyses, other characteristics examined were not statistically
significantly related to prevalence of deformity.
The relations between prevalent deformity and BMD, race, age, BMI, and MT stage were
examined in multivariable analyses; separate models used LS BMD [Table 3] or FN BMD
[Table 4] as predictors. LS BMD was strongly, independently, related to prevalent deformity:
the relative odds of deformity increased by 61% per SD decrement in SWAN baseline BMD
(p = 0.02). We also observedan age effect, with the relative odds of deformity increasing by
21% per year increment in age (p = 0.02). The model using FN BMD as the bone density expo-
sure revealed results similar to those of the LS model. There was a higher prevalence of defor-
mity in relation to lower FN BMD; for each standard deviation decrement in FN BMD, the
relative odds of deformity were 67% higher (p = 0.04). And, the relative odds of deformity
climbed by 20% per greater year of age (p = 0.02). In both models, greater BMI was marginally
statistically significantly associated with higher odds of deformity, with a relative increase of
5% per standard deviation increment in BMI (p = 0.06 in FN model).

women younger than 60 years of age at VM baseline, 4 incident deformities occurredduring
2321 person-years (incidence 1.72 per 1000 PY; 95% CI: 0.03­3.41 per 1000 PY). Women aged
60 years or greater at baseline experienced11 new deformities during 5262 person-years of
observation (incidence 2.09 per 1000 PY; 95% CI: 0.86­3.32 per 1000 PY). Of the 1108 women
in the follow-up sample, 628 had never used bone active medications. Twelve of the fifteen inci-
dent deformities occurred in this group, yielding an incidence of 2.81 per 1000 PY during 4,263
PY of observation (95% CI: 1.22­4.41 per 1000 PY).
Discussion
The SWAN vertebral morphometry study ascertainedprevalent and incident vertebral defor-
mities using DXA in a large, multiethnic, well-characterized,community dwelling sample of
US women with an average age of 54 (+ 2.7) years at the vertebral morphometry study baseline.
Vertebral deformity prevalence and incidence were low, at 3.2% and 2 per 1000PY, respec-
tively. In SWAN, DXA's ability to successfully image cranial-most vertebral levels proved lim-
ited: between 40% and 60% of vertebral bodies were unreadable as vertebral levels ascended
from T6 to T4. With greater BMI, the number of readable vertebrae diminished.
In multivariable analyses, for each year increment in age, the relative odds of fracture
increased by 20% and each standard deviation decrement in LS or FN BMD was associated
with a relative increment in the odds of vertebral deformity of 60% and 67%, respectively. Each
standard deviation increment in BMI was marginally statistically associated with a relative
increase in the odds of deformity of 5%. The rarity of incident deformities in this sample pre-
cluded analysis of their risk factors.

Understanding the performance characteristics of VM imaging using DXA is central to the
interpretation of our findings and to consideration of the use of this technology in large cohorts
in general. Because we used DXA, vertebral deformity in this study is likely underestimated,
particularly grade 1 (which constituted about 2/3 of the deformities in SWAN) and those
occurringin the more cranial thoracic levels. A validation study in 161 postmenopausal
women that compared deformity readings using Hologic 4500A DXA technology to radio-
graphs (the gold standard) reported that DXA was 68% sensitive to the presence of any defor-
mity and that sensitivity rose to 77% when only deformities of grade 2 or more were
considered.[22] False negative vertebral morphometry readings using DXA are partly attribut-
able to difficulty visualizing levels above T7: in the same validation, adequate visualization
through T4 was only achievable in 71% of cases, whereas in 96% of instances levels up to T7
were well-imaged. Of vertebral deformities diagnosed by radiographs, 11% were in levels not
ascertainedby DXA.[22] To our knowledge, SWAN is the first large, longitudinal US cohort to
use DXA for vertebral morphometry readings and only one of three cohort studies to have
done so.[8,12] Of the other two, the Japanese Population-based Osteoporosis (JPOS) Cohort
Study did not report the frequency of unreadable levels while the Tromsø Study successfully
imaged greater than 95% of vertebral bodies at all levels except for the most cranial, T4, which
had an 81% readability rate.[8,12] Tromso study's high imaging success rate compared to
SWAN's may reflect Tromsø's average BMI, which was one unit lower than that of SWAN.
Thus, there is a trade-off between DXA's attributes for epidemiologicalstudies (low cost, high
accessibility, low radiation and, consequently, the capacity for repeated examinations) vs. its
lower imaging success rate and sensitivity when compared with X-rays. Whether other large
studies' experiences with DXA VM assessment will be more like SWAN's or Tromsø's awaits
elucidation.

SWAN's vertebral deformity prevalence of 3.2% (95%CI: 2.3, 4.1) among women in their
50's compares favorably with estimates from 8 other studies that included similarly-aged
women, 6 of which employed radiographs and 2 of which used DXA to assess deformities
[Table 5]. Prevalence estimates in the 50­59 year old age category ranged from 2.7% to approx-
imately 12% but most samples sizes in this age stratum were between 100 and 200 in size.
[8,11,23] Table 5 also illustrates that deformity prevalence is sensitive to the reading method:
in 2 studies that read radiographs using 2 distinct methods, the Eastell criteria resulted in 50 to
100 percent higher values than did the Black or the McCloskey criteria.[11,24]
In the models that examined the relations between LS or FN BMD to deformities, we found
that lesser LS and FN BMD were independently, statistically significantly associated with
greater risk of prevalent deformity. The similarity of risk gradients evident at the spine and hip
sites may appear to contradict prior work that finds a substantively lower gradient of fracture
risk conferred by spine compared to hip bone density.[25] However, LS BMD in our middle-
aged sample is likely to be less confounded by the age-related, pervasive degenerative disease
artifacts that degrade our ability to read a true BMD signal.[26­28] We previously reported
that LS but not FN BMD predicted fracture during the menopausal transition.[29]
That higher BMI is related to slightly greater risk of prevalent deformity may at first seem
counterintuitive, as greater BMI is generally regarded as fracture-preventive due to its associa-
tion with higher BMD.[30­32] However, when viewed from an integrated bone strength per-
spective, there is a pleiotropic effect of obesity: greater BMI increases BMD but not enough to
compensate for the increased load on the bone.[33] Thus, adjustment for BMD (the protection
pathway) exposes the deleterious pathway from BMI to vertebral deformity (which is likely to
be related to the increased load); additionally, this effect is likely underestimated, because
higher BMI resulted in fewer number of readable vertebral levels and likely a systematic under-
estimation of deformities.
The principal strengths of this study consist of its sample size of 1446 mid-life women,
including women of 4 races; to our knowledge this the first vertebral deformity study with
these attributes. Our large sample allowed SWAN to: 1) estimate prevalent vertebral deformity
in women aged 50­60 years (prior studies, reviewed in Table 5, had smaller samples in this age
range and either did not calculate CI's or had broader ones); and 2) to examine risk factors for
fracture in this young age range. This study augments the research community's relatively lim-
ited experience using DXA-based vertebral morphometry in a large cohort.[8,12] We used
BMD values from the initial SWAN scans; while this does not guarantee that spine BMD was
not falsely elevated by prevalent deformity or degenerative disease, it substantially reduces its
likelihood.One limitation of the SWAN vertebral morphometry study is sub-optimal ascer-
tainment of cranial vertebral levels; however, this is expected constraint of the technique, as
reported in the VM validation[19]. Nonetheless, we do not believe that there is a substantial
negative bias in our estimates of deformity because prevalence surveys, in which vertebral frac-
tures were measured by standard x-rays, report that fractures at the levels of T4, T5 and T6 are
very rare. [9,10,12] A second limitation is the small number of prevalent and incident deformi-
ties, which constrain our ability to perform relational analysis of factors related to them; this
limitation is inherent in the age range of our sample. Our multivariable analyses could only be
done cross-sectionally, as there were too few incident deformities to support models.
Conclusion
Using DXA-based vertebral morphometry, we found that the prevalence of vertebral deformity
in women aged 50­60 years enrolled in SWAN was low, at 3.5%, and the majority of deformi-
ties were grade 1. In cross-sectional analyses, lower bone density at both the LS and FN was

most strongly related to prevalent vertebral deformity in middle-aged women, but older age
and higher BMI were also associated with deformities. Approximately half of vertebral levels
from T4-T6 were not imaged by DXA, but due to the rarity of fractures at these levels, this
should not have a meaningful effect on our estimates. Given this technology's known insensi-
tivity to grade 1 deformity, we may have underestimated the prevalence and incidence of grade
1 deformities in our sample. Prospective analyses showed a low incidence of vertebral defor-
mity, estimated at 1.7 per 1000 PY
