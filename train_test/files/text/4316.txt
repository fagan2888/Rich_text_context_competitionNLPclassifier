School Shooters: History, Current
Theoretical and Empirical Findings, and
Strategies for Prevention
Caitlin M. Bonanno1 and Richard L. Levenson, Jr.2
Abstract
Situations involving active shooters in schools have increased in recent years. We define an "active shooter incident" as an
occurrence where one or more individuals participate in an ongoing, random, or systematic shooting spree with the
objective of multiple or mass murders. Attempts to build a profile of active school shooters have been unsuccessful to
date, although there is some evidence to suggest that mental instability, social isolation, a self-perception of catastrophic
loss, and access to weapons play a role in the identification of the shooter in a school shooting incident. This article details
theories and after-the-fact findings of investigations on previous school shooters, and we offer an application of Levin and
Madfis's Five Stage Sequential Model to Adam Lanza, the perpetrator of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
December, 2012. Prevention strategies, suggestions for positive school climates, school security for the physical plants, and
threat assessments are discussed, and implications for future research are offered.

Introduction
Situations involving active shooters in schools have
increased in recent years, with each of the past several
decades having one significant school shooting resulting in
death and psychological traumatization, not just to the
involved school and community but also across the United
States. We define an "active shooter incident" as an
occurrence where one or more individuals participate in an
ongoing, random, or systematic shooting spree with the
objective of multiple or mass murders (Mitchell, 2013). The
term active is used by law enforcement as an indication that
the shooting is currently occurring and implies that an
emergency law enforcement intervention is underway to
stop the shooter as soon as possible. In this article, the terms
shooter and attacker should be considered synonymous.
In 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students
and 1 teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colorado. In 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 students
and professors at Virginia Tech. More recently, in 2012, Adam
Lanza fatally shot 20 first-grade students and 6 adults at the
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
These specific occurrences were particularly significant
because of the high death toll and types of victims. Questions
raised about the personality characteristics of the shooters
became of interest, and research questions and hypotheses as to
motives are areas of ongoing concern.
Although these shootings have the most notoriety, there
have been many other school shooting incidents. In fact,
more than 250 people have been killed in the United States
during active shooter and mass casualty incidents since the
Columbine High School shootings in 1999 (Mitchell, 2013).
In terms of school-based events, Moore, Petrie, Braga, and
McLaughlin (2003) estimated that between 1992 and 2001,
35 incidents of lethal violence occurred in which students
brought weapons to their school or at a school-sponsored
event and shot their schoolmates and teachers. Between
2000 and 2010, 445 school shootings occurred that did not
result in death but in life-threatening wounds (De Venanzi,
2012).
Characteristics of Active Shooters in
School Shootings
Analysis of school shooting incidents renders important
trends. In June, 1999, 2 months after the Columbine High
School shooting, the U.S. Department of Education and the
U.S. Secret Service began to collaborate on a report
examining whether plans for targeted violence at school

Table 1. 10 Key Findings From "The Safe School Initiative."
1. Incidents of targeted violence at school rarely were sudden, impulsive acts.
2. Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attacker's idea and/or plan to attack.
3. Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.
4. There is no accurate or useful "profile" of students who engaged in targeted school violence.
5. Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that caused others concern or indicated a need for help.
6. Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personal failures. Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.
7. Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted, or were injured by others prior to the attack
8. Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.
9. In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.
10. Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents were stopped by means other than law enforcement
intervention (i.e., shooter suicides, arrival of law enforcement personnel).

might have been known and, if so, what could have been
done to prevent the attacks (Vossekuil, Fein, Reddy,
Borum, & Modzeleski, 2002). Targeted violence at a school
is defined as any premeditated incident where a known or
knowable attacker deliberately chooses the school as the
location for the attack (Vossekuil et al., 2002). The findings
of The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School
Initiative: Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks
in the United States (Vossekuil et al., 2002) are the result of
the examination of 37 incidents of targeted school violence
between December 1974 and May 2000 in the United States
and are discussed at length below. Ten key findings from
the study are summarized in Table 1.
Of the 37 incidents of targeted school violence analyzed in
the Vossekuil et al.'s (2002) study, there were some common
characteristics among the incidents. All of the attackers were
males, and 95% of them were current students with 5% being
former students. Attackers worked alone in 81% of the
incidents. Assistance from at least one other peer in the
planning of the attack occurred in 11% of the incidents, but
the attackers in those incidents ultimately carried out the
attack alone. Two or more attackers committed the assault
together in 8% of the incidents. In terms of weapons, 76% of
the attackers used only one weapon, whereas 46% of the
attackers had more than one weapon with them at the time of
the attack. Handguns were used by 61% of the attackers, and
49% of the attackers used rifles or shotguns. In 73% of the
incidents, the attacker killed one or more individuals at the
school, and in the remaining incidents, at least one person
was injured by a weapon. Fifty-nine percent of the incidents
occurred during the school day, indicating that fewer were
carried out before school (22%) or after school (16%).
Targets were not necessarily random, although persons
in addition to targets were also harmed. Attackers had
selected at least one administrator, faculty member, or staff
member as a target in 54% of the incidents (Vossekuil et al.,
2002). Students were chosen as targets in 41% of the cases,
and attackers selected more than one target prior to the
attack in 44% of the incidents. Persons who were targeted
before the attack were actually harmed in the attack in 46%
of the cases. Individuals not identified as original targets of
the attack were also injured or killed, and of these
individuals, 57% were students and 39% were
administrators, faculty, or staff.
According to Vossekuil et al. (2002), there is no
"profile," or "set of demographic and other traits that a set
of perpetrators of a crime have in common" for student-
attackers (p. 11). The use of profiles for identifying
individuals who may commit targeted violence has its own
set of problems as the practice has
a considerable risk of false positives (i.e., most youth who fit
the profile are not a targeted violence risk), has a potential for
bias, and has been sharply criticized for its potential to
stigmatize students and deprive them of civil liberties. (Reddy
et al., 2001, p. 169)
An analysis into the various characteristics of attackers
reveals both similarities and differences among
perpetrators. Attackers came from a variety of family
situations (i.e., intact families to foster homes), and they
differed considerably in social relationships (i.e., socially
isolated to being popular). At the same time, 71% of the
attackers felt bullied, threatened, or injured by others before
committing the attack, a significant finding to note if one
were to attempt to categorize traits of active shooters. In
addition, most attackers had some history of suicidal
ideation or attempts, or a history of extreme depression.
Most attackers were known to have had difficulties coping
with "significant losses or personal failures" (Vossekuil et
al., 2002, p. 35). Academic achievement ranged from
failing to excellent grades. Some attackers had no
behavioral problems whereas others had histories of
disciplinary problems. Although most attackers had no
history of violent or criminal behavior before the attack,
59% demonstrated some interest in violence whether it was
through video games, movies, books, or other media. Most
attackers did not display any significant change in academic
performance, friendship patterns, interest in school, or
disciplinary problems before the attack (Vossekuil et al.,
2002). At the same time, Vossekuil et al. (2002) noted that
93% of the attackers engaged in some behavior before the
attack that made others (e.g., parents, school officials,
Bonanno and Levenson 3
teachers, fellow students) concerned about their behavior.
Targets did not seem to know about the attack beforehand,
as most attackers did not threaten their targets directly
before the attack.
Vossekuil et al. (2002) found that targeted violence at
school is often planned ahead of time with some attackers
devising the idea as few as 1 or 2 days before the attack and
others holding the idea of the attack for as long as a year
before its execution. Motives for attacks varied, and 54% of
the attackers held multiple motives or reasons. For 61% of
the attackers studied, revenge was a reason for the attack,
81% of the attackers had some type of grievance at the time
of their attack, and 66% of the attackers had told other
people about the grievance before the attack. Additional but
less common motives of attackers were trying to solve a
problem (34%), suicide or desperation (27%), and attempts
for attention or recognition (24%).
In terms of advancing the attack, many attackers had
experience using weapons and had access to weapons.
Fifty-nine percent of the attackers had some experience
with a gun, and 68% used firearms that they obtained from
their own home or that of a relative. Vossekuil et al. (2002)
also noted the involvement of others in that 44% of the
attackers were influenced by others in deciding to carry out
the attack, encouraged or dared by others to commit the
attack, or both.
Most school shootings were not stopped by law
enforcement despite prompt response times. Instead, the
shooter surrendered to or was apprehended by school staff
(27% of the incidents) or by students (5% of the incidents).
The attacker stopped on his or her own or left the school in
22% of the attacks, and in 13% of the attacks, the shooter
killed himself. Vossekuil et al. (2002) found that law
enforcement stopped only 27% of the shootings and only
discharged weapons in three of the incidents examined.
Most school shootings were not stopped by law
enforcement, in part, because of their short duration. Forty-
seven percent of the incidents lasted 15 min or less from the
beginning of the attack to the time when the attacker
stopped shooting, surrendered, or was apprehended,
whereas 27% of the incidents concluded within 5 min.
Despite these common characteristics among school
shooters, Lankford (2012) examined the specific subset of
school shooters who end their attack by attempting or
committing suicide. Lankford found that a comparison of
suicide school shooters, workplace shooters, terrorists, and
rampage shooters revealed that differences were mostly
superficial. Although school shooters were far younger than
the other attackers, all four of these offenders actually
struggled with similar personal problems, including social
marginalization, personal crises, or issues at home, school, or
work. Lankford concluded that law enforcement investigators
should not be focused on a particular characteristic but
should pay close attention to individuals who are struggling
with significant personal issues, and Lankford's hypothesis
should be studied further as well as viewed as a possible
beginning point for teachers and administrators when
attempting to identify those who may be at risk of violent
incidents in schools. Although Lankford highlights the
significant role that serious personal problems play in all of
these different types of offenders who attempt suicide,
ultimately, significant psychological problems usually play a
role when any individual attempts suicide. The numerous
similarities drawn across these attackers' results tend to
neglect more specific motives for carrying out violent attacks
against others.
Theories on Active Shooters in the
Schools
Sequential Model for Mass Murder at School
Levin and Madfis (2009) proposed a Five Stage Sequential
Model to explain what might lead students to commit mass
murder at their schools. Each distinct stage is hypothesized
as a necessary condition, but it is the cumulative strain
where these different factors intersect and build on each
other that is viewed as leading to a school shooting (Levin
& Madfis, 2009). The five stages are Chronic Strain,
Uncontrolled Strain, Acute Strain, The Planning Stage, and
Massacre at School.
Levin and Madfis's (2009) first stage of Chronic Strain
stems from Agnew's (1992) general strain theory. Under
Agnew's theory, strain includes a range of negative
experiences or events in social relationships at school,
home, work, or in the neighborhood where the individual
resides. Strain is viewed as a range of difficulties that result
in anger, frustration, disappointment, depression, fear, and,
eventually, crime.
When strain becomes intense and continues for a
considerable amount of time, it becomes "Chronic Strain"
(Levin & Madfis, 2009). Chronic Strain appears to be a
major factor for school shooters as most felt bullied,
threatened, or injured by others, and had a history of
extreme depression and difficulties coping with significant
losses (Vossekuil et al., 2002). School shooters often have
had stressful conditions at home or school (Levin & Madfis,
2009). Leary, Kowalski, Smith, and Phillips (2003) found
that school shooters felt chronic rejection in 13 of the 15
school shooting incidents that they analyzed. The Chronic
Strain at home appears to be reflected in the fact that some
school shooters kill their parents or other members of their
family prior to the shooting. Kip Kinkel murdered both of
his parents; Luke Woodham beat and stabbed his mother to
death; and, more recently, Adam Lanza shot his mother four
times in the head prior to making his way to Sandy Hook
Elementary School (Mendoza, 2002; Schmidt, 2012). Both
Kimmel and Mahler (2003) and Newman, Fox, Roth,
Mehta, and Harding (2004) noted that the shooters came
from intact families and argued that quality of family life is
not best measured by traditional measures such as family
structure or living arrangements.
4 SAGE Open
Another source of strain for school shooters can stem
from interpersonal relationships at school. Agnew (1992)
identified the failure to achieve positively valued goals and
the disjunction between expectations and actual
achievements as additional sources of strain. Middle and
high school students often measure their success in life in
terms of their popularity with peers (Levin & Madfis, 2009)
and, as Vossekuil et al. (2002) have noted, most school
shooters felt bullied, threatened, or injured by others.
Kimmel and Mahler (2003) argued that some school
shooters were attacked about their masculinity through
homophobic slurs and that these shooters may have felt that
they had already failed in their developing manhood. As a
result, it seems likely that Chronic Strain in school shooters
stems from family conflict and/or problematic relationships
with peers at school. Although these conditions create
Chronic Strain, Chronic Strain alone does not lead
individuals to become school shooters. Many youngsters
experience these forms of Chronic Strain and do not
become attackers, and so other psychologically moderating
factors must be in play as well.
Levin and Madfis's (2009) second stage is Uncontrolled
Strain during which the strains of everyday life are left
unchecked by the absence of conventional and/or prosocial
relationships. When faced with Chronic Strain, students
who cannot find acceptance in school may look for
acceptance in their family or may find friends outside of
their school. However, some individuals either never make
meaningful relationships with others or form relationships
with other students who have been marginalized and who
then become supportive of and/or encouraging of their
violent antisocial feelings and beliefs (Levin & Madfis,
2009). In fact, Agnew, Brezina, Wright, and Cullin (2002)
found that juveniles who have little attachment to their
parents or school and/or have relationships with
troublesome friends are generally more likely to react to
strain by engaging in delinquent behavior. Although
Vossekuil et al. (2002) noted that attackers ranged from
socially isolated to popular among their peers, 27% of the
attackers were part of social groups that were disliked by
most mainstream students or were considered to be part of a
"fringe group"; 34% of the attackers were characterized by
others as "loners" or viewed themselves as loners. In an
attempt to lessen the effect of the Chronic Strain, a
youngster may externalize responsibility for failures that
can then increase isolation (Levin & Madfis, 2009).
Levin and Madfis's (2009) third stage, Acute Strain,
takes place when some loss is perceived as catastrophic by
the attacker, and it is this loss that serves as a catalyst for
the attack. Whereas Chronic Strain is persistent and long
term, Acute Strain consists of short-term but especially
upsetting events that seem catastrophic to an already
troubled and isolated individual (Levin & Madfis, 2009).
Most school shooters appeared to have difficulty coping
with losses, and 98% of the attackers had experienced or
perceived a major loss prior to the attack (Vossekuil et al.,
2002). The majority of these losses were a perceived failure
or loss of status, or the loss of a loved one or of a significant
relationship including romantic relationships.
Acute Strain in the presence of long-term Chronic Strain
leads the potential shooter to feel that there is nothing left to
lose and leads to the fourth stage, the Planning Stage. Once
the attacker decides to commit a massacre, some time is
spent planning, as mass murder is not a simple criminal act
(Levin & Madfis, 2009). Most attackers develop a plan at
least 2 days before carrying out the attack, and some spend
much more time than only several days (Vossekuil et al.,
2002). For example, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold spent
more than a year preparing for their attack at Columbine
High School (Larkin, 2007). Time was spent obtaining and
modifying guns, and their attack was timed to be on the
anniversary of Hitler's birthday. School massacres were
rarely impulsive or spontaneous attacks (Vossekuil et al.,
2002). School shooters also tended to not have histories of
having had a mental health evaluation and tended to not be
diagnosed with a mental disorder (Vossekuil et al., 2002).
This mental health background is consistent with the fact
that school shooters do not suddenly "snap" and commit
attacks but rather plan them out. Levin and Madfis (2009)
examined this phenomenon and determined that if school
shooters are not "hallucinating maniacs," then a massacre
must somehow serve as a rational, albeit immoral, solution
(p. 1238). The attack acts as a solution to the shooters' most
serious issues of damaged personal identity and self-worth.
Attackers see the shooting as a means of forcing others to
take notice of them. In addition, a school massacre is used
as a way of asserting masculinity as much of Western
culture associates violence with masculinity (Kimmel &
Mahler, 2003; Newman et al., 2004). Ultimately, ignored
and emasculated young males believe that a massive
shooting will regain lost feelings of power, pride, and
masculinity, and may also have them achieve international
attention (Levin & Madfis, 2009).
The fifth and final stage in Levin and Madfis's (2009)
model is the Massacre at School, where certain facilitating
factors must be in place. In fact, these researchers suggested
that most bullied and isolated boys never commit a school
shooting even if they endure Chronic and Acute Strain, and
that many seriously troubled youngsters who have
considered committing a school shooting and even made
plans for an attack have not carried it out. For potential
attackers to become school shooters, they must have some
firearm proficiency and access to firearms.
The Culture of Narcissism Theory
De Venanzi (2012) argued that antisocial behaviors in
schools, especially suburban schools, do not stem from
pervasive violent media content but from society's
narcissistic culture. In addition to overconsumption and
extreme individualism, narcissism has also come to include
anxiety, a loss of meaning, and a continuous feeling of
Bonanno and Levenson 5
dissatisfaction (De Venanzi, 2012). Furthermore, De
Venanzi proposed that society has overemphasized material
comfort and narcissism leading to feelings of resentment,
envy, and hatred toward others' real or imagined success.
These feelings of frustration toward others can be identified
in school shooters, particularly those in suburban schools,
and act as an impetus for an attack.
The Active Shooter at a College/University
The profile for an active shooter in the college setting has
different motivations (Fox & Savage, 2009). Mass
shootings in universities are often perpetrated by graduate
students (Fox & Savage, 2009). Instead of a history of
feeling bullied or persecuted, like active shooters in high
schools, older graduate students seem to turn to violence as
a response to what they perceive to be intolerable pressure
to be successful or the inability to face the reality of failure
(Fox & Savage, 2009). Graduate students place greater
emphasis on academic work and training and often lack
balance in their personal lives. An intense focus on
academic achievement creates high stakes when there is the
possibility for failure. Fox and Savage (2009) note that
foreign students have extra pressures because their
academic visas are often dependent on their continued
student status. Furthermore, faculty mentors may be less
sensitive to the pressures placed on graduate students and
are ultimately the gatekeepers to success. Inherent in the
understanding of what makes a graduate student an active
shooter surely must be a positive history of a significant
mental disorder, both known and unknown to their families
as well as previously treating mental health professionals.
Improving Survival After School Shooting
Incidents
About half of the school shooting incidents lasted 15 min or
less, from the beginning of the shooting until the attacker
stopped shooting, was apprehended, surrendered, or killed
by law enforcement or by suicide at the end of an incident.
For example, Adam Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook
Elementary school at 9:35 a.m. and shot himself in the head
at 9:40 a.m., and it was fewer than 5 min from the time the
first 911 call was placed until Lanza shot himself
(Sedensky, 2013). Most school shootings were not stopped
by law enforcement intervention because of their short
duration. This finding, which has major implications in
terms of first responders, was the topic of discussion among
the informed leaders from medicine, law enforcement,
fire/rescue, emergency medical services (EMS) first
responders, and military experts brought together by The
American College of Surgeons to explore strategies for
generating policies that will enhance survival of victims of
mass casualty shooting events (Jacobs et al., 2013). The
meeting, known as the Hartford Consensus Conference
(April 13, 2013), used data and evidence from existing
military and recent civilian incidents.
The integrated active shooter response recommended by
The Hartford Consensus Conference is summarized in the
acronym "THREAT" (Threat suppression, Hemorrhage
control, Rapid Extraction to safety, Assessment by medical
providers, Transport to definitive care). Life threatening
bleeding from external wounds is best controlled first
through the use of tourniquets whereas internal bleeding
requires speedy transport to a hospital setting. Jacobs et al.
(2013) note that these concepts are straightforward, proven,
and somewhat inexpensive, and these measures have been
adopted as best practice by many law enforcement agencies.
In addition to hemorrhage control, The Hartford Consensus
notes that the response to an active shooter incident must be
integrated across law enforcement, fire/rescue, and EMS
personnel. The Hartford Consensus stresses that the
response effort must include coordination between law
enforcement and the medical/evacuation providers.
Communication among responders will lead to the best
possible outcomes and part of this communication is shared
definitions for terms used in mass shooting incidents. In
addition, The Hartford Consensus recommends jointly
developed local protocols for responding to active shooter
events and the inclusion of active shooter events in table-
top and field exercises to further familiarity with the
protocols.
Jacobs et al. (2013) noted that long-standing practices
for response to shooting events have involved a segmented,
sequential public safety operation. First, theoretically, law
enforcement responds by stopping the shooting and then
this is followed by rescue and recovery. Although efforts to
stop the active shooter are still of greatest importance,
Jacobs et al. highlight that, medically, early hemorrhage
control is essential for maximizing victim survival. Jacobs
et al. urge that initial actions to control bleeding should be
part of the initial law enforcement response and that
knowledge of hemorrhage control should be a core law
enforcement skill. The injuries sustained in active shooter
incidents bear similarities to those injuries seen in war.
Based on military experience, hemorrhage is the number
one cause of preventable death in victims of penetrating
trauma (Jacobs et al., 2013). To maximize survival of active
shooter incidents, Jacobs et al. believe that there needs to be
an updated and integrated system that can accomplish
multiple objectives simultaneously.
The Hartford Consensus has implications for school
shootings as well. In the analysis of Vossekuil et al. (2002),
most incidents of targeted violence in schools were stopped
by those within the school or by the attacker's suicide.
Given that information, responding law enforcement should
have knowledge of hemorrhage control to maximize the
chances for survival among victims. Basic training in life
support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could
extend to school administrators, teachers, and staff as part
of school protocol as well.
6 SAGE Open
Prevention
Security Measures as Prevention
School shootings, especially those that receive extensive
media coverage, can affect those not directly affected by the
school shooting (i.e., a ripple effect). Individuals become
susceptible to the availability heuristic, or the cognitive
judgmental bias in which individuals tend to draw upon
information that is most easily accessible to them (Furlong,
Morrison, Austin, Huh-Kim, & Skager, 2001; Kahneman &
Tversky, 1996). The result is that when individuals are
asked about the trend of violence in schools, they typically
draw upon the extensive media reports, and their responses
could be skewed. In addition, media coverage can affect
viewers' beliefs about the likelihood of future school
shootings. The Principle of Bounded Subadditivity is a
cognitive process that influences the psychological impact
of an event by changing perceptions that an event that was
once considered an impossibility is now a clear reality
(Furlong et al., 2001; Tversky & Fox, 1995). Under the
Principle of Bounded Subadditivity, an individual can go
from thinking that school shootings do not happen at all, or
in their type of neighborhood, to thinking that shootings can
happen at any school, at any time, in the United States
(Furlong et al., 2001). In fact, as school shootings continue
to occur, it seems likely that this cognitive restructuring
must occur.
Oftentimes, after an active shooter attack, the media
focus on gun control and not on the shooter's personal or
the family's responsibility for the actual act. As previously
noted, school shooters often have access to guns through a
relative or family member. Mass shootings in schools are
among the most difficult violent acts to prevent using gun
control (Kleck, 2009). Because most firearms were acquired
from a family member, guns should be stored in a way that
makes them completely inaccessible by troubled youngsters
(Levin & Madfis, 2009).
In response to a school shooting, many institutions react
with increased security measures. Visible security measures
include physical devices (such as the use of security
cameras) and trained personnel (school security guards) to
prevent school violence (Addington, 2009). The reason that
schools increased security was the intense media coverage
of the Columbine High School shooting as well as the fear
that the media coverage instilled among students and
parents (Addington, 2009). According to Mifflin (1999),
national television networks spent more airtime covering
Columbine than any other previous shooting. The amount
of news coverage could be seen as reasonable as Columbine
was and still is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S.
history. In fact, 68% of Americans followed the coverage of
Columbine "very closely," and the Columbine High School
shooting was the third most closely followed story of the
decade (Pew Research Center, 1999). Communication
between parents, school administrators, and law
enforcement personnel likely influenced decisions to
increase school security measures.
There are several different categories of security
measures that can be implemented in schools (Addington,
2009). One security measure category is limiting access to
the school building through the use of identification cards
(staff and/or students), locked school entrances including
"one-door" policies, visitor sign-in requirements, and gated
campuses. Another category is prohibiting weapons on
campus through metal detectors, lockless student lockers,
and random sweeps for contraband. The third category is
increasing surveillance of students through security
cameras, school resource officers, and staff training (e.g.,
lockdown drills). The final category of security measure is
reacting to a crisis or violent incident through student drills,
duress alarms, and telephones in classrooms. The security
measures that are most frequently used by public school
systems are controlling access to the school building,
limiting access to social networking websites from school
computers, and prohibiting use of cell phones and text
messaging devices (Robers, Kemp, & Truman, 2013).
Addington (2009) stressed that further research is needed
on the effects of school security measures. Security
measures have the potential for creating a negative school
environment by creating student resentment or a prison-like
environment. Addington noted the limitations of studies
that have found the use of school security measures
correlated with higher reports of student victimization and
fear, and greater school disorder. These studies did not have
baseline measures prior to the implementation of security
measures, and so there is no reference point. Addington also
raised concerns about students' privacy rights in school and
the effects of security measures on students' civil liberties.
Climates of Safety in Schools
The key findings from the study by Vossekuil et al. (2002)
have implications for methods to address and/or prevent
targeted school violence. The fact that most attackers
formulated a plan and that others knew about the attackers'
plan offers potential in determining ways to make those
plans knowable. In addition, most attackers engaged in
some behavior that either indicated a need for help or made
others concerned, had difficulty coping, and felt bullied or
injured before an attack. These pieces of information can be
used to identify potentially violent students. Overall, the
information can be used to develop methods to evaluate
risks through threat assessments and then utilize the
information from the threat assessment to prevent potential
school attacks from taking place.
Threat assessments are effective only within the context
of a "climate of safety" (Fein et al., 2002). The major
features and tasks for creating a safe school climate are
summarized below in Table 2. When schools have a climate
of safety, adults and students have mutual respect and

students have a positive connection to at least one adult. In
addition, students are able to openly voice their concerns
without any fear of reprisal. Without fear of punishment,
students are more likely to help other students who are in
distress by appealing to adults in the school environment. In
the ideal, safe climate school, concerns are raised and
handled early on before they become more serious.
Ultimately, the potential for school violence is reduced
because action is taken instead of the information being
kept secret until it is too late and an attack has occurred.
In a safe school climate, staff and students respect each
other, and communication between them is encouraged and
supported. Staff members serve as positive role models for
students. Diversity is respected, and conflicts are mediated.
Fein et al. (2002) also stressed that teachers and
administrators address social­emotional needs in addition
to academic needs. Part of the respect component is
establishing "shame free zones" where "daily teasing and
bullying is not accepted as a normal part of the adolescent
culture" (Fein et al., 2002, p. 12). School environments
where bullying and teasing occur regularly can affect
academic learning and lead to the strain and isolation that
drive some students to physical violence. Part of the safe
school climate is an understanding that violence does not
solve problems and only makes them worse.
Formal anti-bullying programs are a way to change
student culture and reduce the strain from interactions with
peers. Levin and Madfis (2009) recommend Second Step
and Lesson One as educational programs that teach social
skills and promote problem solving. Second Step is a
comprehensive bullying prevention curriculum that is
focused on teaching empathy, emotion-management, and
problem-solving skills. Lesson modules are dynamic and
interactive, and the program includes online training for all
staff. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
Second Step (Frey, Nolen, Edstrom, & Hirschstein, 2005).
Lesson One, which was created by Oliver and Ryan
(2004), teaches elementary school-aged children to develop
internal discipline and other life skills. Research has found
that the Lesson One program increased students' self-
control and problem-solving skills and that the program
had a positive impact on school culture (Oliver & Ryan,
2004).
Another central feature of a safe school climate is
relationships among students and relationships between
students and adults, so that students' academic, safety, and
social-emotional needs are met (Fein et al., 2002). All staff
have the potential to be a person in whom a student can
confide, including teachers, administrators, school
psychologists, secretaries, coaches, custodians, social
workers, counselors, nurses, and safety officers. Each
student needs at least one adult within the school with
whom he or she can discuss concerns.
In some schools, there is a "code of silence" where
students and some adults believe that telling someone that a
student may be posing a threat is a violation of that code
(Fein et al., 2002). Because most school shooters shared
their plans for an attack with peers, having a "code of
silence" keeps the information undisclosed. In a school
climate of safety, students are more willing to share
concerns about their peers without feeling that they are
snitching on a friend.
Threat Assessments
The primary objective of a threat assessment is the
prevention of targeted violence through analysis of the
"actions, communications, and specific circumstances that
might suggest an individual intends to mount an attack and is
engaged in planning or preparing for that event" (Fein et al.,
2002, p. 29). The six principles that inform the threat
assessment process are presented in Table 3. These principles
address the nature of targeted violence and the approach that
should be taken when investigating. When conducting a
threat assessment, attention should be placed on students who
make a threat (i.e., have a plan to harm someone) as well as
those who pose a threat (i.e., engage in behaviors that suggest
an intent or plan to attack; Fein et al., 2002). A threat
assessment investigation should also seek to identify any
major losses or perceived failures with which a student may
be struggling to cope. The inquiry must address whether the
student has access to weapons or firearms.
8 SAGE Open
Table 3. Six Principles of Threat Assessment Process.
Targeted violence is the end result of an understandable, and oftentimes discernible, process of thinking and behavior.
Targeted violence stems from an interaction among the individual, the situation, the setting, and the target.
An investigative, skeptical, inquisitive mind-set is critical to successful threat assessment.
Effective threat assessment is based on facts rather than on characteristics or "traits."
An "integrated systems approach" should guide threat assessment inquiries and investigations.
The central question in a threat assessment inquiry or investigation is whether a student poses a threat not whether the student has
made a threat.
Source. Fein et al. (2002, p. 29).
There are also three elements that guide the formation
and operation of a school threat assessment program: (a)
authority to conduct an assessment, (b) capacity to conduct
inquiries and investigations, and (c) systems relationships
(Fein et al., 2002). For authority to conduct an assessment,
schools need to have policies on collecting and handling
information on potentially threatening situations and criteria
for determining whether a threat assessment and
investigation is necessary. Threat assessments involve legal
issues related to access to and sharing of information and
searching students or their property. Administrators should
consult with the school's legal counsel. School officials
should develop a formal policy that authorizes them to
conduct a threat assessment and the conditions under which
these assessments do not constitute a violation of students'
rights to privacy.
In terms of capacity to conduct school threat
assessments, schools must be proactive and implement a
program instead of waiting for a crisis to occur. Fein et al.
(2002) recommended a multidisciplinary threat assessment
team with a respected school faculty member or
administrator, an investigator (e.g., school resource officer,
or police officer assigned to the school), a mental health
professional (e.g., school psychologist, clinical
psychologist, or forensic psychologist), and other
professionals who may contribute to the process (e.g.,
guidance counselors, teachers, coach). The roles and
responsibilities of the team and the individuals should be
clearly defined, and team members should be trained
together. An ad hoc member of the threat assessment team
could be included if there is an individual who knows the
student of concern and can offer additional information.
There are also specific skills needed by those members of
the threat assessment team such as an analytic and
questioning mind-set, familiarity with child development,
and good judgment in working with others and evaluating
information from multiple sources.
Finally, integrated systems relationships refer to how a
threat assessment program must have relationships among
individuals and organizations within the school and external
to the school. The individuals who form and maintain these
relationships across agencies are referred to as "boundary
spanners" (Fein et al., 2002, p. 39). Boundary spanners
must have strong interpersonal skills as they act as a formal
liaison between systems and meet regularly with different
agencies. They should know how other systems operate as
that aids in integrating relationships among agencies,
developing written protocols, and helping to resolve
conflicts. Fein et al. (2002) also describe detailed
procedures for conducting a school threat assessment and
managing a threatening situation. Fein et al. include a step-
by-step procedure for establishing a threat assessment
program in a school district as well.
Analysis Into the Shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School
On November 25, 2013, the Danbury, Connecticut State's
Attorney released the report on the shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School (Sedensky, 2013). Despite extensive
investigation and information gathering from various
sources, the report states that Adam Lanza's motives for the
shooting remain unanswered. This finding could be
accounted for, in-part, because a computer hard drive from
Lanza's home is still unreadable, and it is highly
improbable that data will ever be recovered. The evidence
did demonstrate that Lanza had planned his actions
including his suicide but that there was no clear reason as to
why he committed the shootings or why he chose Sandy
Hook Elementary School as his target. Although there may
not be a clear-cut concrete explanation for why Adam
Lanza committed a school shooting, at present, analysis of
the evidence gathered seems to fit within Levin and
Madfis's (2009) cumulative strain model and offer possible
explanations.
In fitting Adam Lanza to this theoretical model, one
might speculate on some of his behaviors and resulting
motives. The first stage of the model is Chronic Strain.
Details suggest that Lanza had experienced Chronic Strain
at home, in school, and from his own mental health issues.
The fact that Lanza killed his mother prior to the massacre
at school is already suggestive of strain at home. In
addition, his parents separated in 2001 and eventually
divorced. Lanza's relationship with his father deteriorated
toward the end of 2010 and although his father continued to
email him, Lanza stopped responding. His father remarried
in 2011. Lanza's older brother moved out of state after
college and had no contact with Lanza from 2010 on.
Therefore, for about 2 years before the shooting, Lanza had
no contact with either his father or his older brother.
Bonanno and Levenson 9
Lanza had a relationship with his mother, but it was
highly pathological and complex. Some reported that Lanza
was close to his mother whereas others said that he did not
have "an emotional connection" to her (Sedensky, 2013, p.
30). According to one person, Lanza described his
relationship with his mother as "strained because the
shooter said her behavior was not rational" (p. 30).
Nevertheless, his mother did not work because of Lanza's
condition. Lanza had sensory issues, multiple daily rituals,
and eating idiosyncrasies where he was particular about the
food he ate and how it was placed on a plate, and his
mother was responsible for preparing his meals for him.
Lanza's mother frequently did his laundry as he changed his
clothes often during the day. She also made arrangements
with workers who came to the house because Lanza had
issues with loud noises. At the same time, Lanza never let
his mother into his room to clean and communicated with
her by email despite living in the same house.
In terms of strain experienced at school, teacher reports
seemed mixed about Lanza having been bullied. His father
said that Lanza was bullied about his "social awkwardness
and physical gait," but it was not excessive (Sedensky,
2013, p. 29). Lanza seemed to have few friends growing up.
During his early schooling, he was described as "a nice kid,
though sort of withdrawn" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 33). Lanza's
psychological issues also constituted an additional form of
strain. As far back as preschool, Lanza engaged in
"repetitive behaviors, temper tantrums, smelling things that
were not there, excessive hand washing, and eating
idiosyncrasies" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 34). These behaviors
likely interfered with his interactions with peers and
showed him to be atypical developmentally. In 2005, Lanza
was diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder and was described
as "presenting with significant social impairments and
extreme anxiety" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 34). It was also noted
that Lanza "lacked empathy and had very rigid thought
processes" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 34). Many of those who
knew Lanza described him as "unemotional, distant, and
remote" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 29). His mother explained
Lanza's dislike of birthdays, holidays, and Christmas by
saying he "had no emotions or feelings" (Sedensky, 2013,
p. 30). In terms of social-emotional functioning, Lanza
appears to have extreme difficulties for an extended period
of time that may have made him feel isolated. Although he
may have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, there
are suggestions in the record that a more significant mental
disturbance might have been present, such as
Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type.
Lanza appeared to have few interpersonal relationships,
and those he did have seemed strained. His lack of prosocial
relationships leads to Levin and Madfis's (2009) second
stage of Uncontrolled Strain. Lanza's lack of friends leaves
the Chronic Strain he already experienced unchecked. His
mother noted significant changes in his behavior around the
seventh grade where Lanza stopped participating in
activities such as the school band and playing soccer and
baseball. His written work began to reflect violent themes.
In fifth grade, he wrote a story in which the protagonist has
a gun in her cane and shoots at people including children.
His seventh grade writing assignments were "obsessed
about battles, destruction, and war, far more than others his
age" and the amount of violence in the writing was
"disturbing" according to Lanza's teacher (Sedensky, 2013,
p. 34).
Later, Lanza appeared to become more of a loner and
more socially isolated. In 9th and 10th grades, he became
reclusive and stayed in his bedroom playing video games all
day. He played a variety of video games, some of which
had violent content, and he had a computer game called
"School Shooting." Lanza had a cell phone but never used
it. In addition, his high levels of anxiety, Asperger's
characteristics, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and
sensory issues significantly limited his participation in a
regular education setting. Interventions were suggested,
specifically tutoring, desensitization, and medication, but
Lanza refused to take medication and did not engage in the
recommended behavior therapies. Mental health
professionals who saw Lanza did not see any aggressive or
threatening tendencies that would have predicted his later
actions.
In the third stage of the cumulative strain model, the
school shooter experiences an Acute Strain, which is some
loss that is perceived as catastrophic by the attacker and
serves as a catalyst for the shooting. Lanza's mother had
plans to sell her house in Newtown and move to either
Washington State or North Carolina. Of those choices,
Lanza wanted to move to Washington. The plan was for
him to go to a special school in Washington or get a
computer job in North Carolina. Although such a move may
not appear catastrophic to many, Lanza had extreme anxiety
along with a myriad of other mental health issues. For them
to move, his mother was going to buy a recreational vehicle
(RV) to help with showing and selling the house because
Lanza refused to sleep in a hotel. In fact, when their house
lost power after Hurricane Sandy, Lanza stayed in the house
refusing to go to a hotel. If Lanza's overall debilitating
anxiety prevented him from staying in a hotel, moving to a
new house in a new state may very well have proved
catastrophic for him.
When Acute Strain occurs while long-term Chronic
Strain persists, the potential shooter begins to feel that there
is nothing left to lose and enters the fourth stage, the
Planning Stage (Levin & Madfis, 2009). The evidence from
the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting indicated that
Lanza had formulated a plan. It is difficult to say when
Lanza began planning but he was home alone two days
before the shooting while his mother made a trip to New
Hampshire (she had prepared his favorite meals for him
before leaving). Evidence indicated that Lanza had a
preoccupation with mass shootings, especially the 1999
shooting at Columbine High School. In fact, a spreadsheet
listing mass murders with information about each incident
10 SAGE Open
was found among his possessions. He also collected
newspaper articles about school shootings, one from 2008
of the school shooting in Northern Illinois University and
some from 1891 about the shooting of schoolchildren.
Lanza clearly had a plan as he had materials regarding mass
murders, had removed his Global Positioning System (GPS)
from his car, used ear plugs during the shooting,
purposefully damaged his hard drive, and waited for his
mother to return from New Hampshire and then murdered
her. Extreme emotional disturbance was ruled out as a
defense for Lanza, which fits Levin and Madfis's (2009)
model.
The final stage in Levin and Madfis's (2009) model is the
Massacre at School where certain facilitating factors must be
in place, specifically access to and proficiency with firearms.
All of the firearms that Lanza used had been legally
purchased by his mother. In fact, shooting was a family
pastime. Lanza's mother grew up shooting guns, and they
enjoyed target shooting together. Lanza and his mother took
National Rifle Association (NRA) safety courses. She had
even written out a Christmas check for Lanza to purchase
another firearm. His mother believed that "it was good to
learn responsibility for guns" (Sedensky, 2013, p. 31).
In Levin and Madfis's (2009) model, the attack is
understood to be a solution to the shooters' issues of
damaged self-worth and/or a means of forcing others to take
notice of them. Investigators question why Lanza targeted
Sandy Hook Elementary School. Except for attending
Sandy Hook as a child, Lanza had no continuing
involvement with the school. He was never assigned to any
of the specific classrooms he attacked when he had attended
the school. Perhaps, one has to step back from the specifics
in this case and view how the shooting fits into the larger
scheme. Lanza was obsessed with the Columbine High
School shooting, which was and still is the deadliest high
school shooting in U.S. history. Lanza's attack at Sandy
Hook is the deadliest elementary school shooting in U.S.
history, and it is the second deadliest school shooting after
the Virginia Tech shooting. His goal may have been to
achieve international attention, and Sandy Hook Elementary
School may have been selected merely because of
feasibility. In addition, the classrooms that Lanza attacked
may have had no significance except for their physical
position near the front of the school where he entered the
building.
Conclusion
Mass casualty school shootings have occurred with
increasing frequency in the past 20 years. Research is
needed on prevention, particularly in the areas of security of
the physical plant, school climate, and promoting prosocial
behavior among students, faculty, and staff. Professional
development activities that consist of pertinent information
regarding known characteristics of school shooters should
be a regular part of all school personnel's continuing
education. School districts need to form partnerships with
law enforcement personnel who are specialists in threat
assessment with the goal of policy and program
development as prevention measures.
