Abstract
The paradigm of the rubber hand illusion was applied to a shadow to determine whether the body-
shadow is a good candidate for the alternative belonging to our body. Three kinds of shadows, a
physical hand, a hand-shaped cloth, and a rectangle cloth, were tested for this purpose. The
questionnaire results showed that both anatomical similarity and visuo-proprioception correlation
were effective in enhancing illusory ownership of the shadow. According to the proprioceptive drift
measurement, whether the shadow purely originated from the physical body was a critical factor in
yielding the significantly positive drift. Thus, results demonstrated that the shadow can distort
illusory ownership with the rubber hand illusion paradigm, but the proprioception was clearly
distorted only when the body-shadow was purely applied. This implies the presence of special
cognitive processing to discriminate the self-body shadow from the others.

Introduction
There is a well-known and old game for children called ``ka-ge-fu-mi'' in Japan wherein a
chaser (tagger) tries to step on the shadow of the others (resulting in switching of roles in the
game). In this imaginary world, touching the body-shadow is identical to touching the
physical body. Similar beliefs, such that an attack to the body-shadow is equivalent to
physical body, have been found in various parts of the world, suggesting a special
involvement with the body-shadows in cognitive processing.
Although seeing a shadow of an object is found to have a positive effect on recognizing the
object accurately in many studies (e.g., Castiello, 2001; Elder, Trithart, Pintilie, & MacLean,
2004; Rensink & Cavanagh, 2004) or even to lead to a misunderstanding of the object's
trajectory (e.g., Kersten, Mamassian, & Knil, 1997), fewer studies have examined the effect
of seeing the body-shadow. Exceptionally, Pavani and colleagues have been continuously
exploring the characteristics of the body-shadow in a visuo-tactile interference situation for
more than a decade (Pavani & Castiello, 2004; Pavani & Galfano, 2007; Pavani, Rigo, &
Galfano, 2014). In their research, merely seeing a single hand-shadow was found to cue tactile

attention to the physical hand casting the shadow, compared with the other hand;
importantly, this cueing effect significantly declined when the shadow was transformed
into a polygonal shape or when it was replaced with a static hand-shaped hand picture.
In addition, the polygonal shadow was also found to develop a cueing effect over time,
probably due to the spatio-temporal correlation between the hand and the shadow. These
results, as has been clearly discussed in their respective studies, remind us of the relation
between a tool and physical hand when using the tool in an active way; the tool use extends
the visual receptive field to represent the peri-personal space so that the tool is encoded as an
extension of the body (Iriki, Tanaka, & Iwamura, 1996; Witt, Proffitt, & Epstein, 2005;
Yamamoto & Kitazawa, 2001). A recent report by Kuylen, Balas, and Thomas (2014),
showing that subjects underestimate the distance to a target when the body-shadow is cast
in the direction of the target on the ground, is a further direct demonstration of the validity of
this analogy. In this way, recent limited studies on the body-shadow implied that the
cognitive processing of the body-shadow is overlapped with that of the physical body
in the brain.
Therefore, it is probable that the body-shadow is processed as a substitution or extension
of the physical body casting that shadow, but it is so difficult to assume that the participants
in the related experiments felt their shadow just as a part of the body amid the relevant
perceptual distortion. In other words, the related studies have demonstrated that the body-
shadow can affect the cognitive processing in a level of body-schema but not in a level of
body image (Gallagher, 2005). This seems obvious, considering that we do not misunderstand
the body-shadow as a part of the body in general situations. The question then is whether
there is a way to somehow translate the body-shadow into an alternative belonging to our
physical body?
An obvious feeling we naturally have for each part of the self-body is called body
ownership. Rubber hand illusion (RHI) can provide body ownership to a fake hand based
on spatio-temporal correlation between visual and tactile stimulation (Botvinick & Cohen,
1998). Another type of RHI that has attracted increasing interest over the last few years is
where we see a rubber hand on the top of a desk moving in sync with the movement of a hand
under a desk, called moving RHI. Researchers have somehow controlled an artificial hand
(hand model, computer graphics, and a robot hand) coordinated with the hand movement,
thus completing the visuo-proprioception correlation (e.g., Braun, Thorne, Hildebrandt &
Debener, 2014; Caspar, Cleeremans, & Haggard, 2015; Kalckert & Ehrsson, 2012; Slater,
Perez-Marcos, Ehrsson, & Sanchez-Vives, 2009). Naively speaking, the body-shadow seems a
quick way to realize such a correlation in a more natural manner considering that the motion
of the body-shadow is originally associated with the physical body; we do not need to add
anything for the visuo-proprioception correlation. In addition, RHI is found to be applicable
even to two-dimensional hand appearance (e.g., captured video in Pavani & Zampini, 2007;
hand drawing in Pasqualotto & Proulx, 2015). Despite the body-shadow satisfying the
requirements for the ownership distortion, no research has been directly focused on the
body-shadow in the RHI paradigm.
In this research, four shadow environments were designed for illusion induction to
examine the effect of body-shadow in RHI (Figure 1). Specifically, Handþ and
HandshapeÀ showed the hand's or hand-shaped cloth's shadow, whereas Rectangleþ and
RectangleÀ showed the shadow of rectangle cloth. In addition, the shadow of Handþ
and Rectangleþ (active shadows) moved in sync with the hand movement, whereas
HandshapeÀ and RectangleÀ (static shadows) remained stable regardless of the hand
movement. The participant was asked either to move the physical hand back and forth
(active trial) or to not move (static trial) in the illusion induction. The strength of the
2 i-Perception
body ownership toward the shadow was analyzed on the basis of the questionnaire rating and
the proprioceptive drift measurement.
Results
First, ownership statements for both static and active trials were analyzed using a three-way
ANOVA with within-subject factors: shadow type (Handþ, HandshapeÀ, Rectangleþ,
RectangleÀ), hand movements (static trial vs. active trial), and statement type (illusion vs.
control). The results (see top of Figure 3) revealed a significant main effect of shadow type,
F(3,45) ¼ 20.40, p < .001, and statement type, F(1,15) ¼ 51.84, p < .001, in addition to a
significant interaction among the three factors, F(3,45) ¼ 14.03, p < .001. Hand movement
did not yield any significant effect, F(1,15) ¼ 0.00, p ¼ .98, n.s. A follow-up test with simple
effects analysis revealed that the static trial was accompanied by a significant predominance
of the average rating for the ownership illusion statements over that of the ownership control
statements for the three shadows, Hand þ : F(1,120) ¼ 52.65, p < .001; HandshapeÀ:
F(1,120) ¼ 21.41, p < .001; Rectangle þ : F(1,120) ¼ 4.88, p < .03; Rectangle À : F(1,120) ¼
2.83, p ¼ .10, n.s., whereas such a significant trend was only shown in the active shadows
in the active trial, Handþ: F(1,120) ¼ 104.05, p < .001; HandshapeÀ: F(1,120) ¼ 0.62, p ¼ .43,
n.s.; Rectangleþ: F(1,120) ¼ 35.93, p < .001; RectangleÀ: F(1,120) ¼ 0.04, p ¼ .84, n.s.
In addition, multiple comparisons using Ryan's method (Horn, 1981) revealed that the
hand shadow had significantly greater scores for the illusion ownership rating than
the rectangle shadow in the static trial (p < .001 for Handþ vs. Rectangleþ and
HandshapeÀ vs. RectangleÀ). Finally, the active trial provided significantly higher
ratings for the illusion ownership statements as compared with the static trial for the
active shadows, F(1,120) ¼ 11.80, p < .001 for Handþ; F(1,120) ¼ 27.55, p < .001 for
Rectangleþ), whereas a significant trend toward the opposite direction was found for
the static shadows, F(1,120) ¼ 28.24, p < .001 for HandshapeÀ; F(1,120) ¼ 7.41, p < .008
for RectangleÀ.
Figure 1. Four kinds of shadows were tested in the experiment where only the active (þ) shadow on the
top screen moved in sync with the hand movement on the middle plate. In the static (À) shadow, the hand-
shaped or rectangle cloth, which was large enough to cover the physical hand movement on the middle plate,
was placed on the bottom plate.

significances were calculated based on ANOVA. The bottom graphs represent the results of the
proprioceptive drift where only the Handþ with gaze measurement yielded a significant positive drift

Figure 2. This diagram shows the experimental procedure for one session. The static and active trials
were held one after the other following the common pre-illusion proprioception measurement. Each static or
active illusion induction follows the post-illusion proprioception measurement and the questionnaire.
The order of the trials in a session was counterbalanced among participants.

Next, agency statements for the active trial were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with
within-subject factors shadow type and statement type and revealed a significant main effect
of shadow type, F(3,45) ¼ 20.4, p < .001, and statement type, F(1,15) ¼ 51.84, p < .001, in
addition to significant interaction, F(3,45) ¼ 14.37, p < .001. Simple effects analysis revealed
that the active trial was accompanied by a significant predominance of the average rating for
the agency statements over that of the agency control statements only for active shadows,
F(1,60) ¼ 19.58, p < 0.001 for Hand þ ; F(1,60) ¼ 28.87, p < .001 for Rectangleþ.
Finally, we analyzed proprioception change. Prior to the analysis, the proprioceptive drift of
each participant was calculated for each sight condition (eyes-open and eyes-closed) using a
common pre-illusion proprioception of the right hand (baseline), which was pooled and
averaged per sight condition to restrain dispersion. The obtained proprioceptive drifts
(post-illusion proprioceptive height minus pre-illusion proprioceptive height) were analyzed
using a three-way ANOVA with within-subject factors shadow type, hand movement, and sight
type (eyes-open vs. eyes-closed). The results (see lower left of Figure 3) revealed a significant
main effect of shadow type, F(3,45) ¼ 5.56, p < .003, and sight type, F(1,15) ¼ 6.95, p < .019,
whereas hand movement did not yield a significant effect, F(1,15) ¼ 0.57, p ¼ .46, n.s. In
addition, the multiple comparisons (Ryan's method) under the eyes-open measurement
demonstrated that the drift for Handþ was significantly higher than that of the three other
shadows (p < .004 vs. Handshape À , p < .001 vs. Rectangleþ, and p < .001 vs. RectangleÀ).
Finally, one-tailed Welch's t-test comparison with zeroes showed that Handþ had a significant
positive drift in both the static and active trials with the eyes-open measurement but not with the
eyes-closed measurement, t(15) ¼ 4.01, p < .002 for static trial; t(15) ¼ 3.55, p < .003 for active
trial, whereas the other shadows did not have any significant effect.
Discussion
The questionnaire analysis revealed that both the anatomic similarity to the body-part and
the visuo-proprioception correlation were effective in enhancing illusory ownership.
This demonstrates that the shadow could distort illusory ownership with the RHI
paradigm. In contrast, these effects on the proprioceptive drift were uncertain. In fact,
there was no significant difference in the drift between the static and active trials,
regardless of the type of the shadow shape. In addition, the hand-shaped cloth's shadow
(HandshapeÀ) did not yield a significantly greater drift than the rectangle cloth's shadows in
any situations. Thus, the proprioceptive drift was less sensitive to both the anatomic
similarity and the visuo-proprioception correlation as compared with the illusory
ownership. These points support the recent view that the proprioceptive distortion does
not have a causal link with a feeling of limb ownership (Abdulkarim & Ehrsson, 2016).
As is unusual for the study of RHI, we tested the proprioceptive drift measurement not
only in the eyes-closed situation but also with eyes open toward the shadow (eyes-open
measurement) to probe the effect of seeing the shadow in detail. Contrary to the former
reports with the other artificial hands, all the shadows, including the body-shadow, did not
yield the significant positive drift in the eyes-closed measurement, even for the active trial.
Although we do not have a convincing explanation for this disagreement, it is invalid to
suppose that this is consistently reproducible considering that we found the opposite trend
for the body-shadow in some preliminary experiments. With the eyes-open measurement, the
physical hand's shadow (Handþ) was the only shadow that provided with the significant
positive drift; notably, its drift was also significantly greater than for the hand-shaped
shadow. Thus, the proprioceptive drift did not occur merely because the subjects see the
hand-shaped shadow; the shadow should be the innocent body-shadow. Here, it is also
Kodaka and Kanazawa 5
remarkable that even the static trial yielded the significant positive drift toward the body-
shadow. As the static trial did not involve the physical hand movement, the results indicate
that just seeing the body-shadow results in visuo-proprioceptive recalibration. In the study of
RHI, a few studies have reported that changes in hand proprioception can occur even
without visuo-tactile correlation (e.g., Durgin, Evans, Dunphy, Klostermann & Simmons,
2007; Rohde, Di Luca, & Ernst, 2011). Considering that merely hand-shaped shadow did not
yield such a distortion, it is valid to suppose that there is a special screening to join the group
of artificial hand capable of inducing the drift just by seeing; the body-shadow seemingly has
this membership. In summary, the critical factor to yield the significant distortion of the
proprioception was determined by whether or not the shadow had purely originated from
the physical body, implying the presence of special cognitive processing to discriminate the
self-body shadow from the others.
Methods
In total, 16 students (four females and 12 males, 18­27 years) participated in the experiment.
All participants were recruited from the Faculty of Design and Architecture, Nagoya City
University, and signed informed consent prior to their participation. All participants received
a book of tokens as compensation (1000 Yen). All experiments were conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocols were approved by the ethics committee
of the Nagoya City University.
We set up three acrylic transparent plates vertically at a suitable interval, where the
participant could see a shadow from any of the three kinds of objects (a right hand, a
hand-shaped cloth, or a rectangle cloth). They could be viewed on the screen of the top
plate via a light source installed on the floor, with the palm of the right hand on the middle
plate, 12 cm below the top plate. The shadow on the top screen approximately magnified
the objects below by 5% to 10%. Four shadow environments were designed for illusion
induction: first, an active hand shadow (Handþ) where the top plate shows the right hand's
shadow in a straightforward manner; second, a static, hand-shaped shadow (HandshapeÀ)
showing the shadow of the hand-shaped cloth (on the bottom panel) that remained stable
regardless of the hand movement; third, an active rectangle shadow (Rectangleþ) showing the
shadow of a rectangle cloth (clinging to the right hand) that moved in sync with the hand
movement; and fourth, a static rectangle shadow (RectangleÀ) showing the shadow of the
rectangle cloth (on the bottom panel) that remained stable regardless of the hand movement
(Figure 1).
Figure 2 depicts the experimental procedure for one session. At the beginning of each
session, the experimenter positioned the right hand of the blindfolded participant in place on
the middle plate. Next, the participants were asked to indicate at what height they felt their
right hand was by touching a board attached to the left side of the acrylic plates. To identify
the position of each participant's left index finger, the board was covered with a sheet of
paper with a millimeter grid and the experimenter used a pen to mark the position
corresponding to the central part of the participant's fingernail on this paper. The
measurements were classified into two--eyes-closed and eyes-open, which were
counterbalanced within each participant. Specifically, this proprioception report was done
with the participants' eyes closed (eyes-closed measurement) or with the eyes gazing toward
the black cloth covering the top screen (eyes-open measurement). Next, they were asked to
look at the shadow on the top screen for 1 min while not moving their hand (static trial) or
moving their hand back and forth (active trial). Note that this factor--hand movement (static
or active trial)--is independent from the classification of static or active shadows. Thus, the
6 i-Perception
illusion induction was accompanied by the shadow's movement only when the active trial was
applied for the active shadows (Handþ and Rectangleþ); the static trial did not involve the
shadow's movement for not only the static shadows but also the active shadows. Subsequent
to this illusion induction, they were asked again to localize the right hand with the sight
condition that was applied at the pre-illusion stage. Notably, the eyes-open measurement was
done without the participants taking their eyes off the shadow to measure proprioceptive
height during the prior illusion induction as accurately as possible. Quickly after they
answered four- or six-item questions (see lower right of Figure 3), including statements
relating to ownership (for both trials) and agency (only for the active trial), the trial was
switched to another one. Half of the participants first took the static trial and second the
active trial during a single session, whereas the remaining participants took the opposite.
All participants experienced eight sessions (two sight conditions Â four shadow conditions),
which were allocated randomly to the participants but with a constraint that the same sight
or shadow condition was not applied twice in a row. At least a 30-s break was taken at the
end of each session to restrain the effect of the preceding condition.
