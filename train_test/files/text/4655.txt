Introduction
The Broadband Technology
Papacharissi and Zaks (2006, p-2) have defined broadband
access as "all flavors of high-speed digital voice, data and
video services, as well as the underlying infrastructure, cli-
ents and technologies that enable these services." (p. 2).
More specifically, speeds of at least 384 Kbps and packet-
switched technology are used at the level of interactivity
when adopting broadband access, and these can be allowed
for the control and selection of content. Broadband is the
new innovation high-speed Internet access technology that
provides not only economic and public benefits but also
improves people's lives (B. Anderson & Tracey, 2001;
Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2006a). Broadband Internet diffusion
not only increases national competitiveness (thus increases
Foreign Direct Investment [FDI] in the country; Bankole,
Osei-Bryson, & Brown, 2013; Manzoor, 2012) but also helps
increase international competitiveness by leveraging e-com-
merce activities (Armenta, Serrano, Cabrera, & Conte, 2012;
Ayanso, Cho, & Lertwachara, 2014; Choudrie & Dwivedi,
2004; Dwivedi & Irani, 2009; Johnson, 2010; Wambogo
Omole, 2013; Qureshi, 2012; Wei, 2004).
One of the significant changes in Internet technologies
has been the replacement of narrowband (dial-up) connec-
tion by high-speed broadband connection (Choudrie &
Dwivedi, 2004). Broadband is considered a technology that
provides high-speed broadcast with greater bandwidth,
higher data transmission rates, and always-on access to
applications, services, and content (Qureshi, 2010; Sawyer,
Allen, & Lee, 2003). The exponential growth of Internet
technology has given rise to increased customer expectations
(Wei, 2004). Many research studies have been conducted to
look into various applications of broadband that have huge
potential of increased revenues for communications indus-
tries (Crandall, Lehr, & Litan, 2007; Jung, Perez-Mira, &
Wiley-Patton, 2009; Katz, Vaterlaus, Zenhäusern, & Suter,
2010; Kolko, 2012; Koutroumpis, 2009). Broadband, there-
fore, has a key role to provide an ever more-connected world
to the consumer communities (Bell, 2008).
Broadband in India
First broadband connection in India was given in 1998. The
projected number of broadband subscribers in India by 2007
was 9 million and it was expected that the number will cross

Investigating the Factors Affecting
Residential Consumer Adoption of
Broadband in India
Amir Manzoor1
Abstract
This study aims to explore in detail the factors that affect the consumer behavioral intention to adopt broadband Internet
in a developing country perspective. Various attitudinal, normative, and control constructs were identified and investigated
for their possible influence on broadband Internet adoption. The empirical data for this study were collected using a self-
administered questionnaire that included items related to various attitudinal, normative, and control constructs. Descriptive
statistics and regression analysis were used to test these constructs for their possible influence on Indian consumers' adoption
of broadband Internet. The findings suggest that perceived ease of use (PE), social outcomes (SO), hedonic outcomes (HO),
service quality (SQ), facilitating conditions resources (FCR), and self-efficacy (SE) were very significant predictors of Indian
consumers' behavioral intention to adopt broadband Internet. This study has multifold significance. The integrated research
framework used in this study is an extension of previous well-established research models (such as Model of Adoption of
Technology in Households [MATH], Diffusion of Innovation [DOI], and Theory of Planned Behavior [TPB]) and provides an
enhanced comprehension of broadband Internet by the Indian household consumers.

15 million by 2012. India is considered one of the largest and
fastest growing major telecom markets in the world.
Broadband Internet in India is growing mainly due to the
rapid growth in Indian telecommunication sector. India's
growing economy, rapidly expanding middle class, low tar-
iffs, and highly competitive market have further supported
the continuous expansion of the broadband sector
(ABIresearch, 2012).
Successive Indian governments introduced comprehen-
sive reforms over the last decade that changed the landscape
of telecommunication in India. Indian government has taken
many initiatives, such as Indian PC program, e-governance,
e-learning, and e-healthcare services, to spur the growth of
broadband Internet. Broadband network expansion and
upgrades are underway in India to match up with comparable
Asian broadband markets. Indian government has made
three priorities for its plans to increase broadband penetra-
tion and usage: lower cost-per-engagemen pricing, afford-
able broadband software and hardware, and cheap, consistent
broadband interconnectivity among villages (Pereira, 2011).
The Indian government has continued its policy of an open
and competitive broadband market. Some of the key steps in
this regard included issuing licenses to new telecom opera-
tors, allowing global operators to work with local compa-
nies, privatization of the country's long-distance market,
bandwidth sharing among Internet service providers (ISPs),
allowing the use of Ku-band in both Indian and foreign satel-
lites, and launch of mobile number portability (MNP; the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India [TRAI], 2010). In
2011, the fixed line penetration in India was 3% and around
98% of the Indian population had some form of access to a
telephone (BusinessWire.com, 2011). During the last decade,
heavy investment was made in telecom infrastructure. The
Indian government continued to force completion of restruc-
turing of telecommunications regulatory regime. The TRAI
continued its structural reforms such as adoption of unified
licensing, increased infrastructure sharing, and revised FDI
policy, increasing foreign ownership limit from 49% to 74%
(Press Trust of India, 2012). In 2012, Indian government
approved a national broadband plan. The objective of the
plan was to provide high-speed Internet access and e-govern-
ment services to more than 160 million people by 2014.
Under this plan, an open access countrywide optical-
fiber-based broadband network will be established, which
will provide connectivity to all areas with population of 500
and above by 2013 (TRAI, 2010).
Broadband Internet and Economic Development
There are many factors that boost economic growth, includ-
ing product, process, and organizational innovations, and the
distribution and generation of information and ideas.
Technological changes result from small incremental
improvements over a period of time. However, even a small
improvement in technology can alter how and where eco-
nomic activity is managed (Czernich, Falck, Kretschmer, &
Woessmann, 2011; Majumdar, Carare, & Chang, 2010;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
[OECD], 2008).
OECD (2008) defines broadband as a general-purpose
technology that when incorporated with other information
communication technologies (ICTs) can change how and
where economic activities are managed. This change is
affected through many channels. A clear impact occurs from
investing in the infrastructure itself and related ICTs. Indirect
impacts come from all aspects of economic activity affected
by broadband and which drive economic growth (Collins,
Day, & Williams, 2007).
Ample academic literature is available that has examined
the impact of broadband on firm-level productivity (Holt &
Jamison, 2009). A central theme of the academic literature is
the ability of broadband to create new business models, pro-
cesses, and innovation. It helps in increasing the productivity
and efficiency of the firm. The study of Allen Consulting
Group (2002) reported results from a survey of Australian
business on the cost saving obtained from using broadband
Internet. The results of the survey showed that around 6.3%
businesses experienced cost saving from the utilization of
broadband Internet as compared with the 1.5% from the uti-
lization of dial-up Internet. The research declared that for
Australian businesses, the average cost saving would result
in an overall output gain of approximately 0.32%. These
results are consistent with the most recent research by the
Australian Industry Group (2008) who claimed that more
than 93% of the firms investigated showed that broadband
has a positive influence on the efficiency and output.
A panel of 6,060 New Zealand firms was analyzed by
Grimes, Ren, and Stevens (2012) in a study to find the effect
that various forms of Internet access have on the firm's out-
put. The information collected from the surveys conducted
by Statistics New Zealand permitted the authors to control
for a range of firm characteristics including those factors that
may determine a firm's choice of Internet access. The two
estimation approaches used were an instrument variable (IV)
estimator and propensity score matching (PSM) estimator.
The (IV) estimation results showed higher productivity
impacts from the utilization of broadband. The utilization of
broadband increased the productivity of firms by 21% to
25%. The PSM results showed that productivity increased by
6.9 to 9.7 due to broadband utilization. These effects were
consistent across different types of firms with no significant
differences across an urban versus rural split or across high
versus low knowledge industries. Although the results firm
IV estimation were greater than those gathered from PSM,
the authors of the study favored PSM estimation due to their
low confidence on IV results. This low confidence resulted
from their lack of specific knowledge about the correct func-
tional specification in relation to a firm's labor productivity
relative to its sector.
In addition to examination of broadband Internet on firm-level
productivity, there is growing academic literature that examines
the association between broadband and macroeconomic-level
Manzoor 3
indicators such as economic growth and employment.
Czernich et al. (2011) carried out a panel analysis of 25
OECD countries, using an instrumental variable model, to
estimate the impact of broadband infrastructure on economic
growth. Czernich et al. concluded that the broadband intro-
duction and diffusion had a significant impact in the growth
of gross domestic product (GDP) in the OECD countries
included in the panel study. After the introduction of broad-
band, the per capita GDP of a country was on average 2.7%
to 3.9% greater than before the introduction of broadband,
controlling for country and year fixed effects. It was further
concluded that an increase in 10% points in the diffusion of
broadband raised annual growth per capita by between 0.9%
and 1.5% points annually.
The effect of broadband penetration on the employment
growth, rents, wages, business growth, and industry structure
at the community, industry, and state level was analyzed in
the study by (Lehr, Bauer, Heikkinen, & Clark, 2011)). Lehr
et al. concluded that the take-up of broadband promotes the
economic activity with major effects in the growth of job and
business, especially for larger business and business in
IT-intensive sectors. It was further concluded that the take-up
of broadband had no substantial effect on the wages but that
there was an important link between residential property val-
ues and broadband take-up.
Qiang, Rossotto, & Kimura (2009) used the Barro cross-
sectional and endogenous growth model by using the data
from 120 developing and developed countries to evaluate the
effect that broadband has had on the long-term economic
growth rates over the years 1980 to 2006. The findings from
the empirical analysis recommend a strong and substantial
growth dividend from broadband access in developed coun-
tries. Keeping other factors constant, in a developed country,
a 10% increase in the penetration of broadband would result
in 1.21% increase in the growth of economy. It was found
that keeping other factors constant, a 10% increase in the dif-
fusion of broadband in developing countries would cause a
1.38% increase in the growth of an economy.
The research by Koutroumpis (2009) used a macroeco-
nomic production function with microeconomic model for
broadband investment to estimate how broadband infrastruc-
ture investment contributed in economic growth in 22 OECD
countries over the period of 5 years (i.e., 2002-2007).
Findings showed a strong causal relationship between eco-
nomic growth and broadband. The results also suggested that
there are increasing returns to investment in broadband infra-
structure. Countries with broadband penetration rates of
more than 30% gained higher returns from broadband invest-
ments relative to those countries with lower broadband pen-
etration rates.
The study by Crandall et al. (2007) assessed the impacts
of broadband penetration on economic output and employ-
ment, in aggregate and by industry sector, for 48 states of the
United States over the period 2003-2005. Crandall et al. con-
cluded that non-farm employment in several industries was
positively associated with broadband use. Particularly, for
every 1% increase in broadband penetration in a state,
employment increased by 0.2% to 0.3% each year. The study
also concluded that employment in both manufacturing and
service industries (especially education, finance, and health
care) was positively associated with broadband penetration.
Moreover, the state output of goods and services was posi-
tively associated with the utilization of broadband.
The Broadband Adoption
There exist both macro- (Choudrie & Lee, 2004; Feijoo,
Gomez-Barroso, Ramos, & Rojo-Alonso, 2006; Garfield &
Watson, 1997; Giovanis, 2011; Han, 2003; Hargittai, 1999;
Nam, Kim, Lee, & Duan, 2009; Ooi, Sim, Yew, & Lin, (2011)
; Sim, Kong, Lee, Tan, & Teo, 2012) and micro-level (Chia,
Lee, & Yeo, 1998; Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2006a, 2006b;
Dwivedi, Lal, & Williams, 2009; Irani, Dwivedi, & Williams,
2009; OECD, 2001, 2008) studies on broadband Internet
adoption and diffusion. Most studies have been conducted in
the context of developed countries. There exist few studies in
the context of developing countries (Dwivedi, Choudrie, &
Brinkman, 2006; Dwivedi, Williams, Lal, & Bhatt, (2007) ;
Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007; Khoumbati,
Dwivedi, Lal, & Chen, 2007; Ooi, Sim, et al., 2011).
There exists room for further research to better under-
stand the current state of broadband Internet deployment,
uptake, and diffusion in developing world and a research that
may assist in explaining the factors that may hasten the pro-
cess of broadband adoption. It is believed that broadband
Internet can significantly boost Indian economy by enhanc-
ing the well-being of its people by assisting in the release of
education, health, and telecommunications services at a more
affordable rate to the masses (Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007).
Given such perceived benefits, it is pertinent to gain an
understanding of the factors affecting the consumption,
acceptance, and usage of broadband among Indian
consumers.
Many research studies have been conducted on broadband
adoption in the developing countries such as Bangladesh,
India (Dwivedi, Williams, Lal, & Bhatt, 2007)), the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA; Dwivedi & Weerakkody, 2007), and
Malaysia (Ooi, Sim, et al., 2011). These studies identified
different factors significant in determining the behavioral
intentions (BIs) of consumers to adopt broadband. Table 1
lists the factors.
In the era of continued development of ICTs and emerg-
ing network economy, developing countries, such as India,
are faced with various challenges as well as opportunities
(Kapur, 2001). Inadequate broadband access may result in
negative impact on Indian productivity and is likely to result
in higher operational costs for a number of businesses. This
not only affects the performance of existing Indian firms but
also hinders the attractiveness of India as a potential invest-
ment place. Broadband is immensely important to India
4 SAGE Open
because it can accelerate the economic growth through ICT,
which has been identified as a key factor to improve produc-
tivity performance. Considering the relatively low levels of
broadband adoptions in developing countries, including
India, a research in this area may be helpful in understanding
and accelerating the process of broadband Internet adoption
by consumers in India. It is essential to conduct an empirical
study in India, given the slow rate of broadband adoption.
This study extends the research conducted by Khoumbati et
al. (2007) and Dwivedi et al. (2008) to gain an up-to-date and
deeper comprehension of consumers'perception and attitude
toward the usefulness of broadband technology.
After witnessing the Korean broadband success and the
resultant economic development (Jin, 2005), academicians,
government telecom officials, and information technology
experts around the world are interested in knowing how the
Korean success story can be replicated by gaining an under-
standing of the factors that influenced such a quick embrace
of broadband technology by Korea. This research would be a
valuable addition to existing literature as the reasons for
adoption of consumers can be understood in a more advanced
level from a developing country that is situated in a strategic
location neighboring China. The knowledge of such reasons
would provide a good foundation for other developing coun-
tries that plan to deploy broadband services and to reap asso-
ciated economic and development benefits.
Research Questions and Theoretical Model
This study addresses two research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the decisive factors in
consumers' BI to adopt broadband?
Research Question 2: Which of the factor(s) most sig-
nificantly influence consumer's BI to adopt broadband?
The factors to be studied in the theoretical model of this
research have been derived from theoretical models of
Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), Theory of Planned Behavior
(TPB), and Model of Adoption of Technology in Households
(MATH). Other factors might have an effect on the adoption
of broadband and these factors have been taken into consid-
eration to predict the intention to adopt broadband Internet.
There are five sections of this study. The first section pro-
vides an overview of the research undertaken. The next sec-
tion provides a discussion of the theoretical background and
research model. This is followed by the discussion of meth-
odology. After that, a discussion and detailed interpretation
of findings will be presented. The last section provides a con-
clusion with implications, limitations, and suggestions for
future research.
Theoretical Background and the
Research Model
Theoretical Basis
This study utilizes some important theoretical models, such
as TPB, DOI, and MATH, to examine broadband diffusion.
According to TPB, the IT usage among individuals is driven
by their BIs. These BIs comprised of Attitudes (personal
beliefaboutexpectedoutcomesoftheusageofIT),Subjective
Norm (belief about personal behavior regarding IT usage
with respect to other people expectations), and Perceived
Behavioral Control (personal belief about degree of usage
capability of IT). Many researches have used and adopted
TPB to study the adoption and implementation of informa-
tion technology (Aboelmaged, 2010; Ajzen, 1985, 1988,
1991; Ajzen & Madden, 1986; C. L. Anderson & Agarwal,
2010; Hernández, Jiménez, & Martín, 2010, 2011; M.-C. Lee
& Tsai, 2010; Ortiz de Guinea & Markus, 2009; San Martín
& Herrero, 2012; Schifter & Ajzen, 1985; Venkatesh, Thong,
& Xu, 2012; Yousafzai, Foxall, & Pallister, 2010). Many
studies have extended TPB to fit varying needs of researches
such as the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior
(Decomposed TPB; Cheon, Lee, Crooks, & Song, 2012;
Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2006b; Hartshorne &Ajjan, 2009; Lin,
2010; Pham, Pham, & Nguyen, 2011; Püschel, Mazzon, &
Hernandez, 2010; Ramayah, Rouibah, Gopi, & Rangel,
2009; Venkatesh & Brown, 2001; Yaghoubi, 2010). The
MATH framework is based on three main elements, namely,
attitudinal belief (consisting of utilitarian outcomes [UO],
Table 1. Factors Affecting Broadband Adoption in Different Developing Countries.
Country Significant factors in broadband adoption
Bangladesh Attitude, primary influence, secondary influence, and facilitating conditions resources (Dwivedi, Khan,
& Papazafeiropoulou, 2007)
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Usefulness, service quality, age, usage, type of connection, and accommodation (Dwivedi, Williams,
Weerakkody, Lal, & Bhatt, 2008)
Pakistan Primary influence, facilitating conditions resources, cost, and perceived ease of use (Khoumbati,
Dwivedi, Lal, & Chen, 2007)
India Relative advantage, hedonic outcomes, and cost (Dwivedi et al., 2008)
Malaysia Primary influences (PI), secondary influences, relative advantage (RA), utilitarian outcomes (UO),
facilitating condition resources (FCR), and self-efficacy (SE; Ooi, Sim, Yew, & Lin, 2011)
Manzoor 5
hedonic outcomes [HO], and social outcomes [SO]), norma-
tive belief (consisting of primary and secondary influences),
and control belief (consisting of perceived knowledge [K],
perceive ease of use [PE], and perceived cost). This frame-
work has also been used in research considering it to be more
appropriate and useful to study broadband adoption
(Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). The Rogers's DOI has been
used to study the pattern of diffusion and adoption of new
technology to predict the success of new technology inven-
tion. This model focuses on both the usage and subsequent
usage aspect (Rogers, 1995). One element of DOI, relative
advantage (RA), has been found to be easily applied and
integrated with other constructs used to examine diffusion of
broadband (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2004). Against this back-
drop, this research uses a modified framework that extends
existing models to investigate the factors that affect the BI of
consumers to adopt broadband Internet. The definitions of
each variable are shown in Table 2.
It was found that constructs such as RA, UO, HO, primary
influence, secondary influence, self-efficacy (SE), facilitat-
ing conditions, overall service quality (SQ), and service
value and satisfaction significantly influenced BI to adopt
broadband (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2005; Dwivedi, 2005;
Dwivedi et al., 2006; Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou,
2007); Rogers, 1995). However, other constructs are yet to
be applied to examine broadband adoption. For this study,
we have divided the facilitating conditions variable into two
variables, namely, facilitating conditions resources (FCR)
and facilitating conditions technology (FCT). The purpose is
to look separately at the impact of general facilitating condi-
tions and facilitating conditions related to technology. This
study postulates that BI to adopt broadband is influenced by
several independent variables, which can be categorized into
three broad groups (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2004, 2005;
Dwivedi et al., 2006; Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi,
Khoumbati, Williams, & Lal, 2007). These are as follows:
1. Attitudinal factors, which describe the individual's
perception toward broadband technologies (RA, UO,
HO, SO, SQ);
2. Normative factors, which describe the social influ-
ences that may affect the intention to adopt broad-
band (referents influence [RI], social influence [SI]);
and
3. Control factors, which control or influence the abil-
ity to initiate and maintain a broadband subscription
(K, skills [SK], FCT, FCR, PE, SE).
RA and UO have been found to be significant factors in
determining broadband adoption (Dwivedi & Irani, 2009;
Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007; Venkatesh &
Brown, 2001). Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework
used by this research. This framework is adapted and modi-
fied from Dwivedi (2005) and Dwivedi, Choudrie, &
Brinkman (2006). This framework takes broadband adoption
as an independent variable that is affected by a number of
independent variables that can be categorized as attitudinal,
normative, and control factors. Because very few studies
have examined the broadband adoption in developing coun-
tries (especially Southeast Asian countries), it was decided
that all the possible and appropriate constructs (within the
Indian context) from previous studies, as described in Table
2, would be included in this study.
Hypotheses
Based on the literature review and the developed conceptual
model, following hypotheses were developed for this study.
Hypothesis 1. Attitudinal, normative, and control factors
significantly influence consumers' BI to adopt broadband
(Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2005; Dwivedi, 2005; Dwivedi,
Khan, et al., 2007).
Hypothesis 2. The proposed conceptual model of broad-
band adoption provides an appropriate level of explana-
tion of variance in the consumer's BI to adopt broadband
(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi & Weerakkody,
2007).
Research Method
Sampling and Data Collection
For the purpose of exploratory research, such as the current
study, the survey is considered a suitable instrument for pri-
mary data collection (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2005). A self-
administered questionnaire was developed and used.
Literature review provided the foundation for development
of questionnaire. First, a draft questionnaire was prepared.
The final questionnaire consisted of 21 questions. The Likert-
type scale questions were adapted from Dwivedi (2005) and
Dwivedi et al. (2006) and the demographic categories were
adapted from Choudrie and Dwivedi (2006a). Each question
was a statement followed by a 5-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from "strongly disagree" through "neither agree nor dis-
agree" to "strongly agree." Questionnaires were distributed
both in hard copy format and via e-mails.
Profile of Respondents
Table 3 provides the breakdown of various residential con-
sumers in our sample.
The Sample Plan
Due to the uncertainty regarding the identity of consumers
currently using the broadband facility and the nomadic
nature of access, the snowballing sampling technique
(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi, Khoumbati, et al.,
2007) was used. The researcher sought help from his friends
6 SAGE Open
in India. Initial respondents from academia, the private sec-
tor, government, students, and the public within Mumbai city
were first identified. They in turn referenced their friends and
colleagues from other cities of India who utilized broadband.
This progressively increased the sample size (Selamat et al.,
2008; Ooi, Sim, Yew, & Lin, 2011)). This strategy led to the
questionnaire being administered to 600 broadband users
during the period of June to December 2013. Of the 600
questionnaires administered, 203 respondents returned com-
pleted and usable questionnaires. Thus, a response rate of
33% was achieved. This response rate is comparable with
response rates in recent studies on broadband adoption
(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi, Khoumbati, et al.,
2007; Mugeni, Wanyembi, & Wafula, 2012; Ooi, Lin, et al.,
2011).
Data Analysis
In the initial phase of data analysis, responses were checked
and assigned a unique ID number (Fowler, 2002; Holmström,

Ketokivi, & Hameri, 2009). SPSS software (Version 21) was
used to calculate descriptive statistics. The same software
was used for reliability testing and regression analysis of
research data collected through questionnaires (Hinton,
Brownlow, McMurray, & Cozens, 2004; Straub, Boudreau,
& Gefen, 2004).
Reliability Test
Reliability of constructs was estimated using Cronbach's
coefficient (; Table 4).
Higher values of Cronbach's alpha represent the higher
internal consistency of the construct. Values of alpha greater
than .9 represent very high consistency whereas values
between .5 and .7 represent moderate consistency (Hinton
et al., 2004). In this study, Cronbach's alpha varied between
.879 for SO and .911 for BI. The values obtained suggest that
all constructs were internally consistent.
Testing of Multivariate Assumptions
Before data analysis, we checked the multivariate assump-
tions (such as multicollinearity; Fotopoulos & Psomas, 2009;
Hair, Tatham, Anderson, & Black, 2005; V.-H. Lee, Ooi, Tan,
& Chong, 2010). Table 5 shows the variance inflation factor
(VIF) values of various independent variables. The values
ranged from 1.120 to 1.914 and all values were less than 10

with tolerance value greater than 0.1. Thus, multicollinearity
of data was not shown (Hair et al., 2005). There were no
independent variables that had condition indexes above 30
coupled with 2 variance proportions greater than .50
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Hence, based on these basic
assumptions of the multivariate model, it implies that there
were no statistically significant violations (V.-H. Lee et al.,
2010; Sit, Ooi, Lin, & Chong, 2009).
Descriptive Statistics
In this study, we used 14 constructs to measure the factors
affecting broadband adoption in India. In this section, the
means and standard deviations of the dependent variable BI
and the items related to the 14 constructs are described.
Descriptive statistics for BI. Three questions were used to mea-
sure the consumer's BI to subscribe to broadband (Azab,
2009). Table 6 shows the mean and standard deviations of
aggregate measures for the three constructs used to measure
BI. Respondents showed strong agreement for all the items
of the BI with average score of aggregate measure (M = 4.96,
SD = 1.44). Item BI1 scored the maximum (M = 5.54, SD =
1.26) and Item BI2 scored the minimum (M = 4.20, SD =
1.69).
Descriptive statistics for attitudinal factors. Table 7 shows the
mean and standard deviations of aggregate measures for the
five constructs used to measure attitudinal factors. Respon-
dents showed strong agreement for all the constructs as evi-
dent from their mean and standard deviation values. RA
showed the strongest agreement (M = 5.78, SD = 1.24)
whereas SQ showed the least agreement (M = 5.29, SD =
1.47).

Regression Analysis: Influence of Independent
Variables on Broadband Intention
The study used ordinary least square regression analysis. BI
was taken as dependent variable and 14 constructs as predic-
tor variables. The adjusted R2 was .555 (F = 20.387, p < .001;
see Tables 10 and 11).
The conceptual model of broadband Internet adoption
presented in this study performed well as compared with pre-
vious studies on broadband Internet adoption. The adjusted
R2 for previous behavioral models was .32 (Davis, Bagozzi,
& Warshaw, 1989)), .51 (Davis, 1989), and .435 (Dwivedi,
2005). The adjusted R2 for the model presented in this study
was found to be .555. It shows that the model presented in

this study was able to explain an appropriate and comparable
level of variance in BI. That means that predictor variables
considered in the model of this study are significant in under-
standing the consumers' BI to adopt broadband.
In this validated model, six predictor variables were found
significant for explaining the variation in BI (Table 12).
These predictor variables include HO ( = .249, p < .001),
SQ ( = -.506, p < 0.001), FCR ( = .333, p < .001), SO ( =
-.570, p < .001), PE ( = .922, p < .001), and SE ( = .433,
p < .001). The regression equation for the validated model
was found to be as follows:
BI = 3.11 + 0.249HO - 0.506SQ + 0.333FCR - 0.570SO +
0.922PE + 0.433SE + 0.552
The value of  suggests that the PE had the largest impact in
the explanation of variations of consumer BI to adopt broadband,
followed by SO, SQ, SE, FCR, and HO. RA, The variables UO,
RI, SI, K, SK, and FCT did not significantly affect the BI.
Discussion
The aim of this study is to examine the significant factors
that influence the consumer attitude toward broadband adop-
tion and usage in India. India is progressing fast in IT infra-
structure development and broadband adoption rate. In
comparison with a study on Bangladesh (Dwivedi, Khan, &
Papazafeiropoulou, 2007), a previous study on India
(Dwivedi et al., 2008), the KSA (Dwivedi & Weerakkody,
2007), Pakistan (Khoumbati et al., 2007), and Malaysia (Ooi,
Sim, et al., 2011). Our results show that four constructs--PE
FCR, SE, FCT, and HO--have similar results with the previ-
ous studies. Meanwhile, the findings on SO, SQ, RI, SI, RA,
K, and FCR were found to be contradicted as compared with
the same studies. Following is the explanation of the com-
parison of the differences between our findings and previous
studies in other developing countries.
The RI and SI were found to have no significant effect on
consumers' intention in adopting broadband. This implies
that the influences perceived from social groups (such as
family and peers) and secondary sources (news, newspaper,
or magazines) have no significant effect on consumers'
intention in adopting broadband. This is a significant con-
trast compared with previous studies. The broadband usage
in India is increasing although not at the pace comparable
with its neighbor China. With this, the influence from refer-
ence groups should be a trusted information source for con-
sumers deciding to adopt and use broadband. However, the
results indicate a deficit of consumer trust on information
provided by the reference groups. Therefore, the strategy of
emphasizing on primary influence as a driver to increase
broadband adoption in early stages may require rethinking.
For FCR, our results showed significant effect toward
intention to adopt broadband. This may imply that the strat-
egy to increase broadband adoption rate by providing facili-
tating conditions and supporting facilities (Rogers, 1995)
seems to have significant impact. This is in agreement with
previous studies of Pakistan (Khoumbati et al., 2007) and
Bangladesh (Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007). The results sug-
gest that facilitating factors (such as technical and support
facilities) are important to facilitate and boost up the broad-
band uptake in nations. This finding has significant implica-
tion for ISPs in India investing significantly on enhancing
their technical and support facilities.

For FCT, our results showed no significant effect toward
intention to adopt broadband. Considering the various fac-
tors used to analyze facilitating conditions of technology
(availability of electricity, reliability of broadband connec-
tion, availability of diverse access technologies, and choice
of different service providers), we can explain this finding by
looking at the current highly competitive landscape of broad-
band services in India. With the emergence of many service
providers providing various broadband access technologies
and low switching costs, consumers have liberty to switch
service providers quickly.
From our findings, HO was found to be least significant in
influencing broadband adoption, while UO was found to be
not significant. It appears that consumers'adoption of broad-
band is not affected by either hedonic reasons or utilitarian
reasons. This finding has significant implication for service
providers who invest millions of dollars in broadband ser-
vices to satisfy the consumers' emotional needs and pleasur-
able experiences. This finding is in contrast to experiences of
developed nations, such as South Koreas and the United
Kingdom, that successfully promoted and increased broad-
band adoption in the country by utilizing online games, real-
time sport events, and on-demand video or music to attract
consumers to subscribe to broadband (H. Lee, O'Keefe, &
Yun, 2003). The authorities or industry players in developing
nations may need to revisit this strategy of providing enter-
tainment-based products in their particular national context
to find out what application or content consumers prefer to
subscribe to broadband.
From our results, SO exhibits significant relationships on
intention to use broadband services. No previous study
included this construct in their research model. The finding
suggests consumers believe that use of broadband services
enhance their social status. Combining this finding with the
finding on RI and SI, we could explain by saying that con-
sumers probably do not trust the information provided by
reference groups but believe that use of broadband Internet is
an aid to enhance their social status. This suggests that broad-
band Internet has a strong social connection with respect to
consumer preferences. This has significant implication for
broadband service providers. Service providers may need to
strengthen the brand image of their broadband services.
The non-significant relationship between RA and con-
sumers' intention to adopt broadband is a significant shift
because previous literature has consistently showed strong
positive influence of RA on broadband adoption (Dwivedi,
Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007; Holak & Lehmann, 1990;
Tornatzky & Klein, 1982). Broadband service providers in
developing countries have been focusing on providing their
customers various advantages as compared with traditional
dial-up connection (such as faster downloads, instant com-
munication, always-on connectivity). The finding of this
research suggests that perception of broadband is becoming
less important as an aid to speed up the overall broadband
adoption process. Service providers should not put too much
emphasis on emphasizing broadband benefits to increase
broadband adoption by consumers.
A significant positive relationship of SE with BIs was
expected as mentioned by previous literature (Dwivedi et al.,
2006; LaRose, Gregg, Strover, Straubhaar, & Carpenter,
2007). With higher level of confidence in technology, con-
sumers are more likely to adopt broadband. The industry

stakeholders may have to adopt a segmental approach to
identify and provide relevant education and training to vari-
ous segments of population that do not have access to oppor-
tunities to learn computers and Internet.
SK was found to have no significant relationship with
BIs. It appears that most consumers already possess the req-
uisite knowledge and skills to adopt broadband services.
Currently, the government of India is following a push strat-
egy by providing more facilitating infrastructure, such as
skill-oriented courses, to motivate consumers learn and use
new technologies such as broadband Internet. The research
findings suggest that governments and industry players may
need to revisit this strategy to make it meaningful for con-
sumers and to increase broadband adoption.
From our results, knowledge (K) did not exhibit signifi-
cant relationships on intention to use broadband services. It
is in contrast with previous studies (Choudrie & Lee, 2004;
Dwivedi, Khoumbati, Williams, & Lal, 2007)) that showed a
significant relation of knowledge (K) with BI. PE exhibited
significant relationship on intention to use broadband ser-
vices. It was expected as suggested by previous literature
(Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007).
For knowledge (K), the consumers appear familiar in
using computer and Internet technologies. The government
of India has taken many initiatives to boost computer learn-
ing. This finding suggests that the computer learning initia-
tivesneedtobefurtheremphasizedbyeducationalinstitutions
(such as schools and universities) by offering different vari-
eties of computer learning programs that best suit consumer
needs. For PE, it could be explained that Indian consumers
may lack the knowledge and skill to use Internet technolo-
gies. If we combine it with the finding on knowledge (K), a
further explanation could be that even if the consumers feel
that they have the requisite knowledge to use Internet tech-
nologies, they tend to have less desire in adopting new tech-
nologies and this may prove to be a barrier in using the
particular services. Interestingly, this finding is in contrast
with B. Anderson's (2008) study of European broadband
consumers. B. Anderson found that those users who had the
knowledge and experience of using broadband were most
benefited with broadband Internet, whereas those who lack
the skills, knowledge, and perhaps self-confidence were left
further behind. Therefore, successful broadband adoption
requires further motivation of consumers about broadband
usage and benefits to develop their positive attitudes toward
broadband adoption and use.
From our results, SQ exhibits significant relationships on
intention to use broadband services. This is in line with the
previous study of the KSA (Dwivedi & Weerakkody, 2007).
One reason could be that in the KSA, only one service pro-
vider provides broadband services and consumers have no
liberty of switching in case of dissatisfaction with the ser-
vice. In India, many broadband service providers are offering
different packages to different consumer segments. The
switching costs are low and consumers switch quickly if they
are not satisfied with a service provider. In the past 5 years,
many service providers, especially in the wireless Internet
services, have emerged and created challenges to improve
competitiveness among service providers by providing better
quality of broadband services. To develop knowledge-based
societies in developing countries, it is imperative to improve
quality of broadband services.
Conclusion and Implications
Practical Implications
This study contributes in several ways to the research litera-
ture. At a methodological level, this study proposes and tests
a new model for broadband adoption in a developing country
perspective. Furthermore, it contributes to the ongoing
search for policies that are more effective and strategies to
increase broadband penetration by providing a more detailed
examination of factors that possibly influence broadband
adoption by household consumers. In line with other recent
studies, we find that broadband penetration is positively
influenced by broadband SQ, knowledge (K), and RA. In
addition, this study identified a new construct SO, which is
positively related with broadband adoption by household
consumers.
The findings of this study generate a number of issues that
may be helpful for various stakeholders in Indian broadband
services, namely, service providers, policy makers, regula-
tors, academia, general public, and so on, for informed deci-
sion making and developing a strategy for accelerated
broadband diffusion in India. This informed decision making
is important due to the established positive impact of
increased broadband deployment on economic development
of a country (Bauer, Madden, & Morey, 2014; Ng, Lye, &
Lim, 2013).
The gradual adoption of broadband by the consumers in
developing countries is a concern for both the industry and
government due to the strong positive impact of broadband
deployment on national economic development. Therefore,
this research should offer a substantial contribution to all inter-
ested stakeholders including the ISPs and government.
Practitioners could use the findings of this study when revising
and restructuring their marketing strategy. Academicians
could use the findings of this research to enhance their knowl-
edge of broadband adoption in a developing but fast emerging
economy. Such knowledge can provide a basis for further
research in broadband adoption in other emerging economies.
This study provides useful guidelines for both ISPs and
policy makers to understand factors that can influence con-
sumers' intention to adopt broadband technology. Service
providers and policy makers can use this study to get useful
guidelines and improve their strategies of increasing broad-
band Internet adoption rate. This research identifies many
factors that stakeholders need to focus on to attract more
broadband consumers.

The findings of this research suggest that RI and SI have
no significant relationship with BI. RI has more significance
than SI. Taking this into account, service providers need to
rethink their customer communication strategy to make it
more effective by creating a more effective impression
toward consumers. This is essential so that customers are
attracted to spread positive word of mouth in their social
circles and attract more consumers toward broadband.
The significant influence of self-efficacy on the broad-
band adoption among Indian consumers suggests that service
providers should invest in developing responsive and avail-
able technical support (such as in the form of user manuals,
live streaming on the company website) to attract consumers
who are likely to learn and are confident in exploring the
broadband services.
With less significance attached to the RA, service provid-
ers need to think about some innovative RAs that broadband
can provide, for example, developing content that is specifi-
cally available with broadband services. The more innova-
tive benefits customers receive, the more likely they will
subscribe or use the broadband service.
The significance of SO suggests that service providers
need to think about ways to make their service a tool of social
status enhancement, for example, by branding their service.
It is similar to what happened with the cellular phone in
developing countries. Initially, it was a communication
device. Later on with proliferation of cellular phone devices,
the prices fell and everyone had access to a cellular phone.
The consumers started to make cellular phone a social status
symbol, for example, by buying expensive branded cellular
phones.
The least significance attached to HO has a significant
learning for service providers. They need to look into HO
from the consumers' perspective and provide those applica-
tions to the consumers that could drive their adoption of
broadband. Enhancement and upgradation of broadband ser-
vice may improve consumer experience with broadband ser-
vices. Finally, the high significance attached to the FCR
suggests the need for service providers to invest more on
providing customer-centric services.
Theoretical Contributions
This research, with its advanced and progressive standpoint,
differs from previous research on broadband adoption. This
research is similar to the work done by Venkatesh and Brown
(2001). However, it differs in that it found subjective norm a
non-significant determinant of broadband adoption. Tan and
Teo (2000) and Anckar (2003) found attitudinal and control
factors essential for technology adoption. Both studies found
that attitudinal and control factors were highly significant
predictors of technology adoption or non-adoption. On simi-
lar lines, this research found that subjective norm was a non-
significant predictor of broadband adoption by Indian
households. Anchor also suggested the differences between
the critical barriers for e-commerce adoption and adoption of
computers in U.S. households (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001).
By examining the relationships between BI to adopt
broadband and the 14 constructs, this research provides an
extended model based on three previous models. The model
used in this research provides a greater understanding of con-
sumers' adoption of broadband in a developing country con-
text. India is a fast growing Southeast Asian nation where
consumers still value their traditions despite becoming urban
and technology savvy.
Limitation and Future Studies
Every research has its limitations and this research is no
exception. First, this study used a larger snowball sample
size but it does not ensure the homogeneity of target respon-
dents. Therefore, the results obtained may not be generalized
for the population of India as a whole. Future research on
broadband adoption may emphasize considering a cross-
country or cross-cultural survey. Second, the study was con-
ducted in four major cities of India. The findings may not be
applicable across geographies and cultures. However, con-
sidering the embryonic stage of development of broadband
in India, the selected cities still represent a good sample to
investigate broadband adoption in India. Third, the study did
not supplement the survey-based approach with interviews
to have longitudinal data. Future research can use a longitu-
dinal data collection mechanism to generate better statistical
results. Fourth, this study did not take into account the cor-
relation of factors and effect on others. Future research may
consider including some moderating constructs to examine
the inter-relationships among various factors affecting BI.
This research identified five factors--PE, SO, SQ, FCR,
and SE--that influence consumers'adoption of broadband in
India. Therefore, the first research question has been veri-
fied. From the analysis done, it has been proven that PE has
the most significant impact on BI to adopt broadband.
Therefore, the second research question has been verified.
In summary, this research provides stakeholders of the
broadband industry some very useful guidelines that would
be helpful when industries plan to expand and provide high-
quality beneficial broadband services to the consumers.
