Self-Rated Health and Mortality Among Black
and White Adults: Examining the Dynamic
Evaluation Thesis

Objectives. Many studies of self-rated health show that it is a reliable predictor of mortality even when controlling
for health-related variables and status characteristics. According to previous research, one reason for the consistent find-
ing is that self-ratings of health represent judgments of health trajectories. Althogh self-ratings of health may be dy-
namic perceptions of health, relatively few studies have systematically examined this possibility.
Methods. This study reexamines the prognostic value of self-ratings of health on mortality with data from 20 years
of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey­I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (N  6,833). Special atten-
tion is given to differences between White and African Americans.
Results. Results indicate that event history models of mortality with self-rated health treated as a time-dependent co-
variate are superior to those treating it as a baseline predictor only--the latter are likely to underestimate the effect. More-
over, self-ratings of health predict mortality for African Americans only when treated as a time-dependent covariate.
Discussion. The results suggest that self-ratings of health are sensitive to declines in physical health, especially those
associated with terminal drop. The analysis also demonstrates the importance of using dynamic models for studying the
link between self-rated health and mortality if data from multiple observation points are available.
IDLER and Benyamini (1997) thoughtfully reviewed the
burgeoning literature examining the link between self-
rated (or self-assessed) health and mortality. They noted
that interest in the subject was spurred by research on the
validity of lay reports of health information as well as the
influence of psychosocial factors on health and longevity.
They identified more than 45 studies of the topic (Ben-
yamini & Idler, 1999), and the findings are, in their words,
"impressively consistent." Self-rated health is an indepen-
dent predictor of mortality in most studies, despite numer-
ous control variables, and the link appears especially strong
for men. Idler and Benyamini issued a call for a new gener-
ation of studies on the topic to examine more carefully four
major interpretations for why self-rated health may predict
mortality.
The present study focuses on one of the four interpreta-
tions identified, namely that "self-rated health is a dynamic
evaluation, judging trajectory and not only current level of
health" (Idler & Benyamini, 1997, p. 29). There is some ev-
idence in the literature to support this interpretation, but
much of the extant literature relies on baseline measures of
self-rated health used to predict mortality at follow-up. Al-
though the modeling of mortality has been exemplary in
many of these studies, there are very few studies that exam-
ine how change in self-rated health is related to mortality.
This would appear to be a logical next step for studies of
self-rated health and mortality, especially to determine the
plausibility of the mechanism noted above (i.e., self-rated
health is a dynamic evaluation). The present study uses data
from a multiwave longitudinal national sample to compare
static and dynamic models of the relationship between self-
rated health and mortality. Extending findings on racial dif-
ferences in the validity of lay information, special attention
is also given to determining whether the predictive validity
of self-rated health on mortality differs for White and Afri-
can Americans.
Self-Rated Health as a Dynamic Evaluation
One explanation for the relationship between self-rated
health and mortality is that people incorporate health status
changes into their health ratings. Indeed, one study that in-
cluded both self-rated health and self-rated health decline
found each to be significantly associated with mortality in
bivariate analyses, but that only the latter was significant in
multivariate analyses (Deeg, van Zonneveld, van der Maas,
& Habbema, 1989). Although the standard question for self-
rated health does not ask the person to account explicitly for
changes over time, it appears that respondents consider health
trajectories in rendering their ratings. It has been shown in
several studies that change in morbidity and disability is re-
lated to change in health ratings (e.g., Ferraro, Farmer, &
Wybraniec, 1997), thereby suggesting that self-rated health
reflects, in part, the overall pattern of one's health trajectory.
As noted above, most of the literature on the relationship
between self-rated health and mortality examines how base-
line health ratings influence mortality (e.g., Borawski, Kinney,
& Kahana, 1996; Bosworth, Siegler, et al., 1999; Franks, Gold,
& Clancy, 1996; Hays, Schoenfeld, Blazer, & Gold, 1996;
Idler & Angel, 1990; Idler & Kasl, 1991; Idler, Kasl, & Lemke,
1990; Kaplan & Camacho, 1983; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982;
S196 FERRARO AND KELLEY-MOORE
Schoenfeld, Malmrose, Blazer, Gold, & Seeman, 1994;
Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992; Wolinsky & Tierney, 1998). To
study more carefully the dynamic evaluation thesis, how-
ever, one needs repeated measures of health status, includ-
ing self-rated health, to determine if change in them is
linked to mortality. A small number of studies make use of
any repeated measures, and these studies fall into one of two
groups. First, a few studies have examined change in vari-
ous health status measures, except self-rated health, as pre-
dictors of mortality. Thomas, Kelman, Kennedy, Ahn, and
Yang (1992) examined changes in activities of daily living
(ADLs) and health conditions, but baseline self-rated health
remained significant after accounting for such changes. By
contrast, Wolinsky and colleagues found that accounting for
declines in basic ADLs and lower body function rendered
baseline self-rated health nonsignificant in predicting mor-
tality among respondents of the Longitudinal Study on Ag-
ing (Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1993;
Wolinsky, Callahan, & Johnson, 1994).
Second, we identified only two studies that examined
whether change in self-rated health was associated with
mortality risk. These studies required a minimum of two in-
terviews querying self-rated health followed by a mortality
tracing. Svärdsudd and Tibblin (1990) studied Swedish men
with such a design (i.e., a 7-year re-interview and an 8-year
subsequent mortality follow-up). They found that declines
in self-rated health were associated with higher mortality.
Strawbridge and Wallhagen (1999) examined survival over
28 years in the 4-wave Alameda County, California, study
and reported that self-rated health remained a significant
predictor of mortality even after accounting for the most re-
cent information on health conditions.
Taken together, these two groups of studies point to a
need for further research on how change in self-rated health
may be related to mortality. They supply the most solid evi-
dence to date regarding the dynamic evaluation thesis, but
can be logically extended in many ways, two of which are
considered in this research: (1) method of analysis and (2)
consideration of minority differences.
Modeling Mortality with Multiwave Data
The literature on self-rated health and mortality could be
enhanced greatly by the application of more dynamic meth-
ods for analyzing multiwave data. Specifically, if two or
more waves of data are available with further mortality fol-
low-up, the application of time-dependent covariates would
be most helpful for analyzing how change in self-rated
health is related to mortality (Allison, 1995; Cox, 1972).
The universe of models implementing time-dependent co-
variates is large, but we identified only one article that re-
ported such an analysis (Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1999).
Failure to account for changes in self-rated health in previ-
ous research may lead to underestimates of the relationship
between self-rated health and mortality. Consider the sce-
nario for a 4-wave panel study in which participants rated
their health as good at the beginning of the survey, fair at
wave 2, poor at wave 3, and died before the final wave. (In-
deed, eight respondents to the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey­I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
(NHEFS) fit this exact scenario with scores of 3, 2, and 1 on
self-rated health over the first three waves.) With baseline
predictors only, these respondents would be assumed to be
in good health throughout the survey until death. The use of
time-dependent covariates would enable one to account for
changes over the survey period. In order to highlight the in-
fluence of different types of analyses with multiwave data,
we compared results from models that do not incorporate
time-dependent covariates with those that do.
Models that reflect the timing of changes in self-rated
health are important to consider when testing the dynamic
evaluation thesis. If mortality is perceived as a temporally
proximal outcome of a health decline, one would expect that
health ratings would reflect such concern. In essence, per-
sons may believe that the pace of their health decline is rais-
ing the risk of mortality, or even that they are dying. Geron-
tologists have long expressed interest in the concept of
terminal drop (sometimes referred to as terminal decline or
terminal change). Kleemeier (1962) introduced the concept
of terminal drop by studying the relationship between test
performance and survival. He observed declines in test
scores of men on several occasions over the course of 12
years; however, what was most striking was that the decline
was much greater for those who died after one of the data
collection periods as compared to those who survived dur-
ing that same interval. He observed that declines in intellec-
tual performance may be detected "several years prior to
the death of the person" (p. 293, emphasis added).
Terminal drop indicates that there is a determinant chain
of functional changes that are due to a death process (Berg,
1987; Botwinick, 1977; Palmore & Cleveland, 1976; Riegel
& Riegel, 1972; Siegler, 1974; White & Cunningham,
1988). If self-rated health reflects a dynamic evaluation of
health, then it should decline sharply in the period prior to
death, and more dynamic models of self-rated health may
uncover this phenomenon. Of course, how early such
changes may be observed is an empirical question. In the lit-
erature examining terminal decline in cognitive functioning,
a few studies report declines as early as 7 years or more
prior to death (Bosworth, Schaie, & Willis, 1999; Johansson
& Berg, 1989). The bulk of the studies, however, examine
time windows of 1 to 5 years and show declines in selected
features of cognitive functioning (Jarvik & Blum, 1971; Jo-
hansson & Zarit, 1997; Lieberman, 1965; Lieberman &
Coplan, 1970; Small & Bäckman, 1997; White & Cunning-
ham, 1988; Wilkie & Eisdorfer, 1974). Our interest in the
dynamic evaluation hypothesis is focused on whether peo-
ple might identify preclinical symptoms suggesting health
problems. Therefore, the relevant time window is much
longer than what people consider in cases of "failure to
thrive" or "dwindling" in clinical settings (Egbert, 1996).
Also, key to our concerns is a recognition that the person is,
to some degree, aware of the change in their health.
Self-Rated Health Among Minority Populations
The second innovation needed for research on self-rated
health and mortality is a systematic consideration of minor-
ity populations. Idler and Benyamini (1997) conclude their
review of studies of self-rated health and mortality by offer-
ing four suggestions for the "next stage of studies." Two of
their recommendations focus on studying "special popula-
SELF-RATED HEALTH AND MORTALITY S197
tions" and "cognitive/cultural processes." These are superb
suggestions, but we would like to add to the list a greater
consideration of minority health and aging. Ethnic minority
group members can be considered a special population, and
cultural factors are certainly a part of ethnicity. Neverthe-
less, very little attention has been given to ethnic or racial
differences in the predictive validity of self-ratings of health
on mortality. The literature includes a number of studies of
populations with limited ethnic or racial variation, either in
the United States (Borawski et al., 1996) or other countries
(Shahtahmasebi, Davies, & Wenger, 1992); some of this is
probably due to the composition of the population. Never-
theless, there are numerous studies of the United States or
other diverse societies that do not give systematic consider-
ation to ethnic or racial differences (Deeg et al., 1989; Ka-
plan, Barell, & Lusky, 1988; Kaplan & Camacho, 1983;
LaRue, Bank, Jarvik, & Hetland, 1979).
Given the substantial health inequality in American soci-
ety by racial and ethnic groupings, one would expect more
interest in the topic. Dozens of studies of morbidity, disabil-
ity, and health ratings across the life course reveal that Afri-
can and Hispanic Americans have poorer health (American
Medical Association, 1991; Ferraro and Farmer, 1996;
Hummer, 1996). Many members of ethnic minorities have
less frequent or delayed contacts with physicians (Himmel-
stein & Woolhandler, 1995; Wolinsky et al., 1989), suggest-
ing that they may also be less likely to have a definitive di-
agnosis about conditions that bother them (and thus present
to a physician at a more advanced illness stage). Indeed,
some research shows that African Americans exaggerate
their subjective probability of survival (Hurd & McGarry,
1995). Thus, one wonders if self-ratings of health have less
predictive validity on mortality for minority group mem-
bers. In a study comparing White and African Americans,
Ferraro and Farmer (1999) found that self-reports of mor-
bidity were equally predictive of mortality for both groups,
but whether the same holds true for self-rated health re-
mains to be seen. Many studies do not even include a con-
trol for racial or ethnic variation (e.g., Thomas et al., 1992);
of those that do, none have examined whether change in
self-rated health is predictive of mortality. In short, we are
unaware of any studies that compare the predictive utility of
self-ratings of health on mortality across U.S. ethnic groups.
The present analysis is designed as a first step to fill this gap
by examining the predictive validity of self-rated health
over time on the mortality of White and African American
respondents. The basic research questions addressed are
twofold:
1. Is change in self-rated health associated with higher mor-
tality risk? We will answer this question by comparing
the use of models with and without time-dependent cova-
riates to highlight the contribution of changes in self-
rated health. It is anticipated that self-rated health will
manifest a stronger relationship to mortality in models
with time-dependent covariates.
2. Is the predictive validity of self-rated health on mortality
contingent on race? Given the substantial health inequality
in American society, we ask whether self-rated health has
less utility for predicting mortality among Black adults.
METHODS
Sample
Data for this research are from the NHEFS. A multistage,
stratified, probability sample of noninstitutionalized persons
received a medical examination and survey interview in
1971­1975 (N  14,407). The NHEFS baseline was admin-
istered in modules, and this analysis proceeds with those re-
spondents who were administered the detailed component
including the health care needs questionnaire (n  6,913).
The first follow-up occurred about 10 years later in 1982­
1984, and the next two follow-ups were in subsequent 5-year
intervals (1987, 1992). A detailed description of the sampling
and operational procedures is provided elsewhere (Cornoni-
Huntley, Huntley, & Feldman, 1990; National Center for
Health Statistics, 1987).
Parts of this analysis focus on differences in outcomes
based on race. At the baseline, respondents were asked to
specify their race (White, "Negro," or Other) only if the an-
swer could not be visually determined by the interviewer.
Due to the small number of other racial and ethnic groups
(i.e., 41 Asian Americans), further subsample analyses with
these groups were not possible. The present study analyzes
5,955 White and 878 Black respondents at the baseline sur-
vey who were followed across time. Response rates among
those who received the detailed components were very high
(86% in 1982­1984, 87% in 1987, and 85% in 1992). The
number of accumulated deaths over the approximate 20-
year period is 1,938, or 28% of the baseline sample. Each
survey is referred to as a wave (W); the first wave is consid-
ered W1 (or baseline).
Measures
The measurement of self-rated health in NHEFS was a
single question asked at each wave: "In general, is your
health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" Excellent
health is scored 5 and poor health is scored 1. Although
some researchers have found it useful to examine contrasts
between specific categories of self-rated health (or aggre-
gates of those categories), the linear form of self-rated
health was used here for two principal reasons. First, we de-
sired to avoid the coarseness involved by collapsing the five
responses into fewer categories. Second, treating self-rated
health as a time-dependent covariate is far more parsimoni-
ous when the original form is retained.
In order to assure that the relationship between self-rated
health and mortality is not spurious, most investigators have
included a broad array of independent variables including
morbidity and status characteristics and resources. Morbid-
ity is measured with two variables, both counts of diagnosed
health conditions. The National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey­I (NHANES­I) differs from many other sur-
veys by asking if the respondent had been diagnosed with a
particular health condition rather than relying on respondent
opinion. Respondents were asked, "Has a doctor ever told
you that you have . . . hypertension or high blood pressure?"
Each condition was first coded as a binary variable (1
equals condition is present). Next, separate sums of serious
and chronic nonserious conditions were created (Ferraro &
Farmer, 1999; Small & Bäckman, 1997). Serious condi-
S198 FERRARO AND KELLEY-MOORE
tions, those that are life threatening, include cancer, diabe-
tes, heart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and
stroke. Chronic nonserious conditions asked at all waves in-
clude arthritis, cataracts, hip fracture, and kidney trouble.
Several measures of health behavior were included in the
analysis. First, respondents were asked two questions re-
garding their amount of daily physical activity: "In things
you do for recreation, for example, sports, hiking, dancing,
etc., do you get much exercise, moderate exercise, little, or
no exercise?" and "In your usual day, aside from recreation,
are you physically very active, moderately active, or quite
inactive?" Subjects who answered "little or no exercise" on
the first question and "quite inactive" on the second were
considered quite inactive and coded 1 for restricted activity;
all others were coded 0. Second, survey respondents were
asked if they had a regular physician for their health needs
(1  yes, 0  no). Finally, current smokers and past smok-
ers of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes were separated out in bi-
nary variables, 1 indicating yes and 0 indicating no.
Indicators of socioeconomic status include income (ranges
from 1 to 12, with 12 equal to $25,000) and education
(ranges from 0 to 7, with 7 equal to graduate school). Those
with private medical insurance and recipients of Medicaid
are indicated by binary variables (1 equals yes).
The measurement of the other covariates is fairly straight-
forward. Female, Black, lives alone, widowed, and lives in a
rural community are all dichotomous where 1 equals the
name of the variable. Respondents with a body mass index
(BMI) equal to or greater than 30 are considered obese and
coded 1 (all others are coded 0). Given the nonlinear rela-
tionship between BMI and many health outcomes, under-
weight respondents--BMI less than 18.5--were also identi-
fied and coded 1 (all others are coded 0). In order to account
for the possible influence of psychological distress on both
self-rated health and mortality, a self-rating of "strain, stress,
or pressure in the last month" was also included (Farmer &
Ferraro, 1997). Ages ranged from 25 to 74 at baseline. Sev-
eral additional variables were considered in preliminary
analyses, but deleted from subsequent consideration after
they did not manifest a significant relationship with mortal-
ity in multivariate models (e.g., South, overweight [BMI 
25 and  30]). Unfortunately, measures of social support or
social networks are conspicuously missing in NHEFS. Item-
missing data were modest (i.e., 5%) and were handled via
specific-mean imputation by age (45, 45­64, 65), sex,
and race categories (Little & Schenker, 1995).
Vital status was determined at the follow-up surveys for
all traced respondents and confirmed by death certificates.
Brief interviews were conducted with proxies of the de-
ceased respondents. Date of death was obtained for 1,935
decedents, so continuous-time event history models were
applied. (Only all-cause mortality is considered; disease-
specific cause of death, from death certificates, is not used.)
For additional analyses related to identifying the time win-
dow for the dynamic evaluation thesis, four categories of vi-
tal status were created based on the timing of death relative
to each survey: died within 12 months of the survey; died
between 13 and 24 months of the survey; died between 25
months after the survey and the time of the next survey; and
survived. This process was repeated for waves 2 and 3. For
analyses for each wave, binary variables differentiating the
categories were tested against a reference group of those
who survived to the next survey wave. Mortality data are
not available past the fourth wave.
Analytic Plan
Although our preferred analytic strategy is to apply time-
dependent covariates in proportional hazards models, the
analyses were completed with additional strategies to com-
pare findings. First, the analysis began with event history
models specifying baseline self-rated health as predictive of
mortality--parallel to the common approach in the recent
literature (e.g., Bernard et al., 1997). Second, we specified
several types of models with time-dependent covariates (Al-
lison, 1995; Fisher & Lin, 1999).
There are many different ways to implement time-depen-
dent covariates, but the simplest uses the most recent value
available. If no changes are reported, baseline information
is used. If change is reported, the value reported at the most
recent observation is used. A second type of model uses the
most recent values but scales them by time of observation
(Allison, 1995, pp. 140­147). In essence, a time stamp is
placed on the most recent value. Although no information
on initial values is used for those persons who changed their
rating, the time of the most recent value is incorporated in
the analysis. Knowing when the most recent value was ob-
served is a critical piece of information when there are three
or more data collection points.
A third type of time-dependent covariate analysis builds
upon the preceding approach but incorporates change in the
covariate. Both the initial value and all transitions in the co-
variate are used to estimate the partial-likelihood function.
This approach may be described as time-indexed change be-
cause three pieces of information regarding change in the
covariate are parsimoniously incorporated into the partial-
likelihood estimation (Allison, 1995, pp. 150­152). Time-
indexed change captures the magnitude (i.e., unit change in
self-rated health), direction (i.e., increase or decrease), and
timing of the transition(s). If the dynamic evaluation thesis
is correct, self-rated health should remain a significant pre-
dictor in these models. Indeed, one may expect that its asso-
ciation with mortality will be stronger.
We estimated selected analyses with all three approaches
and compared them to the results predicated on baseline
values only. All of the models with time-dependent covari-
ates yielded the same substantive conclusions, but the mag-
nitude of effects varied slightly. Whereas model fit was su-
perior for the time-indexed change analysis, those results
will be presented in the following section and compared to
those from models using baseline information only.
As noted above, the time between survey waves is fairly
long, leading to the possibility of coarseness in the model-
ing of mortality. Especially for the first follow-up, self-rat-
ings of health may have declined during the 10 years, but
this was not measured among respondents who died. The likely
effect of this would be an underestimate of the association
of self-rated health on mortality. In order to test for potential
coarseness, we estimated what Allison (1995) refers to as ad
hoc models of time-dependent covariates. We incorporated
a time stamp to estimate changes in self-rated health using
SELF-RATED HEALTH AND MORTALITY S199
the baseline characteristics and follow-up information when
available. Two strategies for these regression imputations
were used: (a) imputing integer values of self-rated health,
and (b) imputing noninteger values. Both methods yielded
results that were very similar to our findings, suggesting
that potential bias due to the coarseness of measurement in-
tervals is minimal.
To summarize, our analysis proceeded in three stages.
First, we estimated the models described here to compare
the results. Second, we used the time-indexed change mod-
els to incorporate more than one time-dependent covariate.
Consistent with our interest in minority aging, these models
were estimated on the total and race-specific subsamples.
Finally, we examined the timing of declines in self-rated
health on mortality with retrospective analyses. Self-rated
health at each of the first three waves of the study was re-
gressed on vital status after the respective survey. The timing
of death was used to delineate categories of deceased subjects
anticipating that self-rated health would be lower for those
dying shortly after the survey.

RESULTS
The results of the baseline and time-dependent covariate
analyses are presented in Table 1 (with 95% confidence in-
tervals). Risk ratios (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) are
presented for the total sample and separately for Black and
White respondents. The first equation (column) indicates
that, consistent with the bulk of the literature, poor self-
rated health at baseline (W1) is associated with a greater
risk of mortality for the total sample (RR  0.91). Serious
illness is also associated with higher mortality, as are re-
stricted activity and age. Higher mortality is also observed
for men, African Americans, the tails of the BMI distribu-
tion (i.e., obese and underweight persons), current smokers,
and those with limited socioeconomic resources (less in-
come, lacking private medical insurance, and on Medicaid).
Past smoker is not a significant predictor, perhaps because
of the long time frame for NHEFS (the duration of not
smoking is longer, thereby reducing the effect of past smok-
ing on mortality). Mortality did not differ for rural and ur-
ban respondents after controlling for the other variables, but
persons reporting more distress in their lives manifested
higher mortality risk.
Although the subsample analyses are similar in many re-
spects, there are some notable differences for the Black and
White respondents. First, self-rated health is not a signifi-
cant predictor of mortality for African Americans, but it is
for White persons. Second, the effects of some of the health
status and health behavior variables are different across the
two groups (chronic illness, restricted activity, and obesity).
Finally, the socioeconomic variables have somewhat differ-
ent effects. For example, private medical insurance reduces
mortality for White respondents but not for Black respon-
dents. The association between Medicaid and mortality that
was observed in the full sample is observed only in the
Black subsample when race-specific models are estimated.
The next set of equations (last 3 columns) presents the re-
sults from the analysis where self-rated health is treated as a
time-dependent covariate. For the total sample, self-rated
health is again significant, but the effect is much stronger
when treated as a time-dependent covariate, thereby provid-
ing evidence for the dynamic evaluation thesis. The pattern
of significant findings is almost identical to what was ob-
served in the first equation, where only baseline self-rated
health was considered, and the effects of most variables are
similar. One notable difference between the first and fourth
equations is the effect of distress. Although distress pre-
dicted mortality in the first equation, treating self-rated
health as a time-dependent covariate rendered the effect due
to distress nonsignificant. This is an important observation
because many of the previous studies reporting a link be-
tween distress or depression and mortality may have been
reflecting concern about unmeasured declining health.
In the equation for the African American subsample,
treating self-rated health as a time-dependent covariate
leads to different results from what was seen in the earlier
model. Self-rated health, including change in it, is strongly
linked to mortality risk, although such a conclusion could
not be derived from the baseline predictor model. This
means that African Americans, just as their White counter-
parts, adjust their health ratings in such a way that is predic-
tive of mortality. While the effects of many of the covariates
on mortality are similar to those in the baseline model, the
magnitude of effects for several variables changes. Many of
the effects are reduced slightly, but some are actually
greater once accounting for self-rated health as a time-de-
pendent covariate (probably reflecting suppression). For ex-
ample, the effect due to serious illness is larger in the model
with self-rated health treated as a time-dependent covariate.
As anticipated, the results for the White sample are quite
similar to the results for the total sample. Given the differ-
ences observed across the Black and White subsamples, a
number of interactions with race were tested (i.e., age, self-
reported health), but none were significant.
The results thus far reveal substantial support for the idea
that self-rated health is a dynamic evaluation; it reflects tra-
jectories at least as they pertain to mortality risk. This is an
important finding, but it is possible that incident morbidity
during the study could be at least partly responsible for the
greater mortality risk. While Fisher and Lin (1999) assert
that "the use of time-dependent covariates offers exciting
opportunities for exploring associations and potentially
causal mechanisms" (p. 146), they also argue that these
analyses must be approached with caution. In particular,
they note that there is the "possibility of too much modeling
and overfitting of a data set" (p. 152). With two measures
for morbidity (serious and chronic, nonserious), we fol-
lowed their advice and treated one morbidity variable as
time dependent at a time. (We also tested for several other
significant time-dependent covariates--one at a time--but
found none.) The results, presented in Table 2, compare
models with and without self-rated health as time depen-
dent, but where morbidity is time dependent throughout.
The results for the total sample in Table 2 reveal that self-
rated health remains a strong predictor of mortality even
when morbidity is treated as a time-dependent covariate.
This relationship is evident when using baseline self-rated
health or treating self-rated health as time dependent (model
2). The magnitude of the relationship is reduced somewhat
by also considering two forms of morbidity as time depen-
dent (i.e., compare RR from Tables 1 and 2: 0.78 and 0.81,
respectively).
The race-specific results in Table 2 show again that self-
rated health is a significant predictor of mortality for Afri-
can Americans only when it is treated as a time-dependent
covariate. Neither of the morbidity variables is significant
for the Black subsample in Table 2. For the White subsam-
ple, mortality risk is shaped by self-rated health in both
models (used as a baseline or time-dependent predictor), but
the magnitude of the relationship is reduced compared to
Table 1 results. In short, incident morbidity during the study
was partly responsible for the greater mortality risk associ-
ated with changing self-rated health. Nevertheless, for both
White and African Americans, the link between changing
self-rated health and mortality persists after controlling for
changing morbidity.
Given the differences in the number of cases in the White
and Black subsamples, supplementary analyses were under-
taken to assure that the differences between the subsamples
are not simply the result of the larger subsample of White
respondents. First, the equation for the White subsample
SELF-RATED HEALTH AND MORTALITY S201
was reestimated on a random sample of 814 respondents in
order to match the frequency of the Black subsample. The
second set of analyses involved taking a subsample of
White respondents so that the number of deceased persons
equaled those deceased in the Black subsample. Given the
lower mortality of White respondents, the first approach--
matching the number of Black cases--yields fewer deaths
in the White subsample. Therefore, we also reestimated the
models on a slightly larger sample of White respondents
(n  1,179) so that the number of deaths (outcome variable)
was equal across Black and White respondents. This set of
analyses confirmed all of the significant relationships re-
ported with the total White sample. Although the effects of
some of the covariates were slightly different in the two ap-
proaches, the findings and conclusions regarding self-rated
health and well-known risk factors (e.g., serious illness, fe-
male, age) were consistent across both of these sets of esti-
mates and the results presented.
The final step in our analysis is designed to clarify the
changes in self-rated health that occur as a result of ap-

proaching death and to provide some insight into the timing
of the dynamic evaluation thesis. Self-rated health at the
first three waves of the study was regressed on four catego-
ries of vital status based on the timing of death relative to
each survey wave: died within 12 months, died between 13
and 24 months, died between 25 months and the time of the
next survey, and survivors. The logic of these analyses is to
exploit the longitudinal data by "retroactively" considering
how proximity to death may have influenced self-rated
health. Figure 1 displays the mean levels of self-rated health
for each of the four vital status categories at each wave. It
appears that there is a terminal drop phenomenon on self-
rated health for those respondents who died within 1 year of
the survey. The effect is strongest for the most proximate
deaths (within 1 year after being interviewed), but remains
substantial for all of the decedents between survey waves.
People adjust their health ratings to reflect the health prob-
lems experienced in the last few years of their lives.
Table 3 presents the results of multiple regression analy-
ses for each wave where binary variables differentiating the
vital status categories were tested against a reference group
for those who survived to the next survey wave. These mod-
els also include the independent variables considered ear-
lier. (Whereas the first interval between waves is 10 years
and the intervals between the last three waves are 5 years
each, a dummy variable for more than 5 years is included in
analyses for the first follow-up.) For the first equation,
death within one year was the only vital status dummy vari-
able significant in the equation. After controlling for the
other independent variables, only the most temporally prox-
imate deaths are associated with lower self-rated health,
suggesting that terminal drop is reflected in self-rated health
in the year prior to death. For the second and third waves,
all deaths between survey waves, regardless of when they
occurred, are associated with lower self-rated health; this
suggests that self-rated health is adjusted even earlier than
one year prior to death. There are several reasons why the
findings may differ from W1 to W2 and W3, but one seems
most plausible. As is common in national health surveys,
the NHEFS baseline interview was completed on noninsti-

tutionalized persons. As such, this selection effect may be
most likely to influence baseline health ratings. There is no
such noninstitutionalization restriction for any of the fol-
low-ups. The effects of most of the remaining variables are
consistent with the literature on self-rated health. Morbidity,
age, race, and socioeconomic variables are all significantly
related to self-rated health.
DISCUSSION
The literature on self-rated health has proliferated in the
past decade, and the bulk of the studies finds that self-rated
health is a remarkably consistent predictor of mortality de-
spite controlling for numerous variables. The purpose of the
present study has been to extend the literature in two ways:
(1) to apply more dynamic models for examining the rela-
tionship between self-rated health and mortality, and (2) to
give greater attention to minority health ratings.
First, we sought to systematically examine Idler and Ben-
yamini's (1997) thesis that self-rated health is a dynamic
evaluation of health: Does self-rated health reflect a per-
son's health trajectory? While it seems reasonable to assert
that self-rated health reflects a dynamic evaluation of health
status, there have been very few studies that systematically
examine such a thesis. There have been dozens of studies
that examined whether baseline self-rated health is related
to mortality, and one that examined whether the expectation
of declining health was independently related to mortality
(Wolinsky & Tierney, 1998). A few studies have also exam-
ined how self-rated health affects the probabilistic assess-
ment of life expectancy (Hurd, McFadden, & Gan, 1998;
Hurd & McGarry, 1995). We are aware of only two studies,
however, that use repeated measures of self-rated health to
examine how change in the ratings is related to mortality
(Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1999; Svärdsudd & Tibblin,
1990). Unlike those studies, the present research used a na-
tionally representative sample while treating self-rated
health as a time-dependent covariate. It also tested explicitly
for differences in the effect of self-rated health on mortality
for Whites and African Americans. We hope to see more
studies that will examine these relationships with different
samples and different time lags.
The findings from the NHEFS offer some of the most
systematic evidence to date that self-rated health reflects
health trajectories, especially the steep declines associated
with death after the last survey measurement. Not only was
baseline self-rated health predictive of mortality for NHEFS
respondents, but models of change in self-rated health
showed a stronger relationship with mortality risk. One con-
clusion from this study, therefore, is that self-rated health is
probably a stronger predictor of mortality than has been re-
ported in many previous studies. Many of the previous stud-
ies that relied on baseline self-rated health to predict mortal-
ity had fairly long lag times (e.g., 28 years, Deeg et al.,
1989). The fact that baseline self-rated health is an indepen-
dent predictor of mortality with such long lag times is an
important finding, because longer lag times work against
finding such an effect (or underestimating such an effect).
Accounting for more recent health ratings among the
NHEFS survivors shows that the association between self-
rated health and mortality is even stronger than estimates
derived using baseline self-rated health alone. Moreover,
estimating mortality with both morbidity and self-rated
health treated as time-dependent covariates accounts not
only for the more recent ratings, but also the transitions in
health ratings from wave to wave among those who survive.
Another way to consider whether self-rated health is a
dynamic evaluation is whether terminal drop reflects itself
on self-rated health. That is, if self-rated health reflects a
person's health trajectory, one would expect that temporal
proximity to death would be associated with the steepest de-
clines in self-rated health. In essence, evidence for steep de-
clines in self-rated health associated with mortality risk
would suggest that people are, to some degree, aware of ter-
minal drop and adjust their health ratings accordingly.
Evidence from the NHEFS shows that declines in self-
rated health precede most deaths within a 1-year follow-up
period. The models presented in Table 3 for W2 and W3 are
residualized change analyses, and in both equations persons
who died within 12 months after the previous interview
showed a decline in self-rated health. It is clear from these
analyses that people adjust their health ratings to reflect
their mortality risk, and that change in self-rated health as-
sociated with terminal drop is not solely a function of
changing morbidity. We conclude that Idler and Benyamini
(1997) were quite correct in suggesting from previous re-
search that self-ratings of health "reflect a dynamic, rather
than static, perspective on health" (p. 29). While their sug-
gestion was based on a thoughtful reading of a literature that
was dominated by fairly static models, the findings from the
present investigation based on more dynamic models offer
some of the most compelling evidence that this is the case.
The second major contribution of the present research is
to give greater attention to minority health ratings in the
prediction of mortality (and exhort others to do likewise in
future research). In the most simple of terms, one wonders
whether self-rated health "works" as a predictor of mortality
for minority groups. Many minority groups, especially Afri-
can Americans studied in detail here, are health disadvan-
taged and limited in various ways to quality medical care
(Himmelstein & Woolhandler, 1995; Wolinsky et al.,
1989). Thus, the question of whether African American
self-rated health operates as a predictor has important policy
implications. Do African Americans interpret and respond
to a question about their self-rated health in the same way
that White Americans do? Do Black persons understand
that they are approaching their death? Given the concerns
about early detection of disease, are they aware of their
mortality risk due to incident disease?
The answers to these questions will differ depending
upon the mode of analysis. Findings from the NHEFS that
rely on baseline self-rated health show that self-rated health
does not predict mortality risk. By contrast, models incorpo-
rating self-rated health as a time-dependent covariate show
that they do. Three conclusions are inescapable. First, one
would reach absolutely contradictory results depending
upon model specification. Second, models incorporating
time-dependent covariates are superior inasmuch as they ac-
count for transitions in self-rated health among survivors.
Third, African Americans are quite perceptive of their
health declines, including the rapid declines associated with
S204 FERRARO AND KELLEY-MOORE
terminal drop. Moreover, even adding morbidity as a time-
dependent covariate did not negate the effect of self-rated
health as a predictor of mortality. Self-ratings of health
work just as well for African Americans as they do for
Whites if the models incorporate change in health ratings.
We believe that this study is only a first step in what Idler
and Benyamini (1997) call "the next stage of studies." There
are several lines of research that we believe merit further and
more detailed examination. First, the present investigation
has systematically examined one minority group only.
Whether the findings extend to Hispanic, Native, or Asian
Americans is not known. Second, we agree with Idler and
Benyamini's (1997) call for pursuing qualitative approaches
to the subject of health ratings and mortality. Several of these
studies have shed important light on the topic (e.g., Krause &
Jay, 1994), and we believe that ethnographic analyses of the
health trajectory thesis could be an important contribution.
Third, we disagree with Idler and Benyamini's (1997) asser-
tion that "researchers are fast approaching, if not already
reaching, the limits of what secondary analysis of these large,
longitudinal data sets can tell us about the relationship be-
tween self-ratings of health and mortality. There is a point
when replication becomes redundancy" (p. 31).
While we agree that isomorphic replications of previous
studies may not yield much in the way of scientific or health
policy value, we disagree that secondary analysis is neces-
sarily "approaching something of an impasse in understand-
ing" (p. 34). Rather, we assert that the rich multiwave data
sets that include repeated measures of self-rated health (and
other health variables) open up a new vista of studies that
can incorporate more dynamic models of self-rated health
and mortality. Those types of analyses may help us to better
understand Idler and Benyamini's (1997) assertion that self-
rated health involves the assessment of one's health trajec-
tory and not only the current level of health. There are other
issues, such as a better understanding of minority health rat-
ings, that can be gleaned from such quantitative analyses of
large data sets. A number of such large prospective studies
are underway, and we hope that investigations comparing
various ethnic or racial groups will ensue.
Whichever direction the literature on self-rated health
and mortality flows, the findings from the present analysis
provide systematic evidence for the assertion that health rat-
ings reflect a dynamic perspective on health. People adjust
their ratings of health in a way that is associated with mor-
tality risk, and this phenomenon is clearly observed in the
year prior to death reflective of terminal drop. The changes
in health ratings can be observed for both White and Afri-
can Americans only when dynamic models of self-rated
health and mortality are estimated.
