Abstract
Objective: Acute mesenteric ischaemia leads to intestinal damage. Restoration of blood flow
results in further damage to tissue, which is called reperfusion injury. This study aimed to
investigate the protective effects of short-interval postconditioning and to determine the optimal
interval for reperfusion in an experimental rat model of intestinal ischaemia.
Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats were grouped as follows: sham (Sh), ischae-
mia þ reperfusion (IR), ischaemia þ postconditioning for 5 seconds (PC5), ischae-
mia þ postconditioning for 10 seconds (PC10), and ischaemia þ postconditioning for 20 seconds
(PC20). For postconditioning, 10 cycles of reperfusion (5, 10, or 20 seconds) interspersed by 10
cycles of 10 seconds of ischaemia were performed. Blood glutathione reductase (GR) and
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured. Intestinal tissue damage was assessed
histopathologically.
Results: GR levels were significantly higher in the PC5 group than in the IR group (37.7 Æ 9.0 vs.
18.5 Æ 2.0 min/g Hb). GPx levels were significantly higher in the PC10 group than in the IR group
(43.2 Æ 9.2 vs. 15.9 Æ 4.6 U/g Hb). The histopathological score was significantly lower in the PC5
group (1.1 Æ 0.1) than in the IR group (2.1 Æ 0.2).
Conclusion: Short-interval postconditioning reduces reperfusion injury in the ischaemic bowel
and the optimal interval for reperfusion is 5 seconds. The long-term effects of short-interval
postconditioning and the optimal reperfusion interval in intestinal ischaemia­reperfusion in rats
need to be investigated.

Introduction
Acute mesenteric ischaemia occurs as a
result of decreased blood flow to the intes-
tine because of several reasons, such as
systemic hypotension, major cardiovascular
surgery, trauma, and midgut volvulus or
intussusception in infants. This can lead to
intestinal ischaemia and ischaemic injury.1
Moreover, some bowel surgeries, such as
intestinal resection or transplantation, are
performed through occlusion of mesenteric
arteries for preventing bleeding.2 A decrease
in blood flow to the bowel leads to hypoxia,
and this causes elevated levels of oxygen-
derived free radicals. After blood flow is
restorated in this ischaemic tissue, more
oxygen-derived free radicals are released.
These oxygen-derived free radicals cannot
be exterminated by enzymatic antioxidant
defense systems. This phenomeon is called
reperfusion injury and this leads to further
tissue injury.
The bowel is the most sensitive organ to
ischaemia­reperfusion injury among the
abdominal organs.3 Intestinal cells can be
easily injured during the ischaemia­reperfu-
sion period and mucosal injury leads to an
increase in intestinal permeability and in
systemic bacterial translocation.4,5
Several methods have been used to
decrease tissue ischaemia­reperfusion injury.
Zhao et al.6 were the first authors to report
postconditioning. This technique consists of
performing a few short periods of intermit-
tent reperfusion applied just after an ischae-
mic episode and before reperfusion occurs.
This method has been used in some clinics
and animals models to decrease reperfusion
injury.7­9
This study aimed to assess the preventive
effects of short-interval PC (SIPC) and to
determine the optimal intervals of reperfu-
sion for PC in an experimental rat model of
intestinal ischaemia (Figure 1).
Material and methods
This study was performed in the
Experimental Laboratory of Adnan
Menderes University and was approved by
the Local Ethics Committee. Forty adult
male Wistar rats were used. The rats were
randomly divided into five groups as fol-
lows: sham-operated (Sh, n ¼ 8); ischae-
mia þ reperfusion (IR, n ¼ 8), ischaemia þ
postconditioning for 5 seconds (PC5, n ¼ 8),
ischaemia þ postconditioning for 10 seconds
(PC10, n ¼ 8), and ischaemia þ postcondi-
tioning for 20 seconds (PC20, n ¼ 8).
Briefly, anaesthetisia was performed
using ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine
(3 mg/kg) injection intramusculary. Surgery
was performed via median laparotomy.

In the IR, PC5, PC10, and PC20 groups, the
superior mesenteric artery was clamped
together with its collaterals using an atrau-
matic vessel clamp for 45 minutes to induce
ischaemia. No arterial pulsation was
observed in the intestinal segments during
the ischaemic period.
After the ischaemic period, in the IR
group, the vessel clamp was opened for 45
minutes. In the PC5 group, the vessel clamp
was opened for 5 seconds, and immediately
after this time, the artery was occluded by
vessel clamp for 10 seconds. In the PC10
group, the vessel clamp was opened for 10
seconds, and immediately after this time, the
artery was occluded by vessel clamp for 10
seconds. In the PC20 group, the vessel clamp
was opened for 20 seconds, and immediately
after this time, the artery was occluded by
vessel clamp for 10 seconds. In all of the PC
groups, the interval procedure was repeated
10 times. When the procedure was finished,
45 minutes of reperfusion was performed in
all of the PC groups and in the IR group. In
the Sh group, no intervention was
performed.
Intracardiac blood samples were
obtained from all of the rats to determine
blood glutathione reductase (GR) and gluta-
thione peroxidase (GPx) levels immediately
after 45 minutes of reperfusion. All of the
rats were sacrificed after blood and intestinal
samples were obtained for histopathological
and biochemistrical evaluation.
Histopathological analysis
For histopathological evaluation, tissue
damage in the experimental groups was
evaluated using a six-level scoring system.10
This scoring system was as follows: degree 0,
normal; degree 1, mucosal injury and no
necrosis; degree 2, necrosis of villi and crypts
are normal; degree 3, necrosis of villi and
crypts; degree 4, deeper muscular or full-
thicknes mucosal necrosis; degree 5, full-
thickness necrosis.
Statistical analysis
The Mann­Whitney U test was used for
statistical analyses.
Results
The biochemical parameters and histo-
pathological scores in the study groups are
shown in Table 1. The mean GR level in the
PC5 group was similar to that in the Sh
group. The mean GR level was significantly
higher in the PC5 group than in the IR
group (P ¼ 0.04). The mean GPx level in
the PC10 group was significantly higher
than that in the IR group (P ¼ 0.02).
Histopathological evaluation showed that
the mean histopathological score in the PC5
group was lower than that in the IR group
(P ¼ 0.01).
Discussion
Oxygen-derived free radicals cause tissue
damage and their peak production occurs
in the first few minutes after reperfusion.
The peak production of oxygen-derived
free radicals during this initial phase
of reperfusion is the major factor of

reperfusion injury.11 Some methods have
been used to minimize reperfusion damage.
One of these methods is PC, which was first
reported by Zhao et al.6 in an experimental
cardiac ischaemic model. The model by
Zhao et al.6 includes several short reperfu-
sion cycles immediately after ischaemia and
before reperfusion. With this method, pre-
venting the sudden increase in production of
free radicals in the ischaemic area during
reperfusion is possible.
Reperfusion injury has two phases. The
first phase is the early phase and the second
is the late phase. The early phase is shortly
after reperfusion and continues for a few
hours. The late phase continues longer and
is associated with nonreversible tissue
injury. Ozkisacik et al.12,13 showed that
SIPC prevented testicular damage in the
short and long term in a rat model of
testicular torsion. They performed 10
cycles of reperfusion (5 seconds in the PC5
group, 10 seconds in the PC10 group, and 20
seconds in the PC20 group) interspersed by
10 cycles of ischaemia (10 seconds in all
groups) for SIPC. They found the the
optimal reperfusion interval for PC was
5 seconds to prevent ischaemia­reperfusion
injury in their experimental model. They
reported that SIPC led to a decreases and
then an immediate increase in reactive
oxygen species during the early phase and
tissue injury. They also suggested that PC
reduced late phase tissue injury via reduced
neutrophil and macrophage deposition, and
thereby reduced reperfusion injury. In our
study, we found high GR and GPx levels in
the early phase of the reperfusion period in
blood samples immediately after ischaemia.
Therefore, this appears to be a preventive
effect in the intestinal ischaemia­reperfusion
model.
Some studies have evaluated the
preventive effect of PC in bowel ischaemia­
reperfusion injury. Rosero et al.14 investi-
gated the optimal PC algorithm in a
rat model of intestinal ischaemia.
They performed PC with five cycles of
10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1 minute for
each cycle after a 60-minute ischaemic
period. They found that ischaemic PC was
not able to minimize or prevent intestinal
tissue injury in rats undergoing ischaemia
and the reperfusion process. Nakamura
et al.15 also reported that short cycles of
PC were not effective in preventing intestinal
tissue injury in rats. In their study, they
performed 5 cycles of 30 seconds of reperfu-
sion interspersed by 5 cycles of 30 seconds of
ischaemia. Based on these two studies, we
considered that if the PC interval time was
shorter than that in these studies it could
protect the bowel against reperfusion injury.
In the present study, the PC intervals (5, 10,
and 20 seconds) were shorter than those in
the studies by Nakamura et al.15 and Rosero
et al.14 and SIPC was able to protect
the bowel against reperfusion injury.
In this study, we obtained beneficial results
in the PC5 group, in which 10 cycles of
5 seconds of reperfusion interspersed by
10 cycles of 10 seconds of ischaemia was
performed for PC.
GPx catalyzes the peroxidation of hydro-
gen peroxide in the presence of reduced
glutathione to form water and oxidized
glutathione. Several studies have demon-
strated the protective effect of GPx and GR
in ischaemia­reperfusion injury in various
tissues.16 In our intestinal ischaemia­reper-
fusion model, the mean level of GR in the
PC5 group was significantly higher than that
in the IR group. Moreover, comparison of
GPx levels among the groups showed that
the mean GPx level was significantly higher
in the PC10 group than in the IR group.
Therefore, we concluded that tissue damage
was least with the reperfusion intervals of 5
and 10 seconds for PC.
In the present study, intestinal tissue
damage was also assessed histopathologic-
ally. We found that among the study groups,
intestinal damage was lowest in the PC5
group. Therefore, the tissue-protective effect
Ozkisacik et al. 1039
of PC was reduced with increasing reperfu-
sion intervals of PC.
The present study shows that SIPC can
minimize reperfusion injury in the intestinal
ischaemia­reperfusion model in rats. This
technique is easily applicable. The optimal
reperfusion interval was 5 seconds because
higher blood GR levels and the lowest
histopathological grade were observed with
this reperfusion interval. We observed that
as the reperfusion interval became pro-
longed, the tissue-protective effect of PC
was reduced in the present experimental
model, which is similar to our previous
testicular torsion model in rats.12
Therefore, intestinal damage could be
decreased by SIPC during the first phase of
reperfusion. Further studies are required to
investigate the long-term effects of SIPC and
the optimal reperfusion interval in intestinal
ischaemia­reperfusion in rats.
