The long-standing debate over the trajectory of
extensive agricultural production in the US Great Plains
deserves a new look. At issue is whether it is possible in the
long term to maintain an agriculturally oriented population
in this region, as well as in other similar regions around the
world.One group of analysts,whom we call"catastrophists,"
sees Great Plains farming, especially dryland production of
small grains, as an ongoing ecological mistake that will lead
to another disaster like the crop failures and soil erosion of the
1930s (Sears 1935, Lockeretz 1978, Worster 1979, Popper
and Popper 1987). Another group, the "adaptationists," rec-
ognizes the negative environmental effects of extensive crop-
ping in this semiarid region, yet acknowledges the benefits
of technical and social innovations,including adaptations to
climate variability ranging from no-till management to crop
insurance, which adaptationalists believe have stabilized the
agroecosystem on the plains (Webb 1931,Thornthwaite 1936,
US Great Plains Committee 1936, Malin 1944, Hewes 1974,
Hargreaves 1993,Cunfer 2005).The two schools interpret the
Dust Bowl droughts differently. Catastrophists emphasize
the influence of farming practices that were incompatible with
the environment, whereas adaptationists regard climatically
extreme conditions as the main cause of soil erosion,economic
loss,and out-migration.Given recent advances in agricultural
practices, the question for the Great Plains is whether these
technologies and adaptations can keep pace with environ-
mental degradation resulting from declining water resources,
impacts on soil and water quality, greater climate stress due
to climate warming, and changing sociopolitical perspec-
tives on agricultural land use in the Great Plains.
Most of the available historical data on the status of Great
Plains agriculture support the adaptationists.Except for two

Long-term Trends in Population,
Farm Income, and Crop
Production in the Great Plains
WILLIAM J. PARTON, MYRON P
. GUTMANN, AND DENNIS OJIMA
Despite concern about the social, economic, and ecological viability of the agricultural Great Plains, a century-long examination reveals that threats
to society, economy, and environment are counterbalanced by surprising stability and the potential for short- and medium-term sustainability.
Populations in metropolitan counties have grown, whereas rural populations may now be stable; both metropolitan and rural populations are aging.
Technological advances in the past five decades enhanced production in the Great Plains despite periodic adverse economic and environmental
conditions, and increases in crop yields, animal feeding, and government payments have sustained agriculture and income. Nonmetropolitan
counties with irrigated farming have been more successful than those without irrigation. However, overuse of groundwater and rising energy costs
for irrigation affect economic margins and the ability to sustain environmental integrity. Long-term projections of agricultural productivity must
balance recent stability with the risks posed by reduced irrigation, higher energy prices, disruptive demographic changes, and further loss of
environmental integrity.

a set of fairly smooth trajectories. These paths do not always
go in the same direction. What is striking to us, however, is
that despite the risks, there have been few abrupt changes of
direction, and the two points of punctuation that are best
known (the drought and depression of the 1930s and the
increase in prices in the 1970s) had consequences that,
although lasting,were eventually incorporated into a relatively
smooth line of change.The persistence of extensive cropping,
and the 100% to 300% increase in crop production since 1940
for the major crops, falsifies the direst predictions of the
catastrophists.
Our analysis focuses on long-term patterns in popula-
tion, agricultural production, and economic activity. In the
US Great Plains, human population data show continued
regional growth,but detailed data show finer-grained patterns,
such as out-migration from the most agricultural counties and
in-migration to metropolitan (metro) counties (those with
a population of 50,000 or more) and near-metro counties.
These population movements reflect both national demo-
graphic trends and the changing nature of agriculture,whereby
technological change leads to reduced labor demand. The
decrease in total population and the increase in population
aging since 1930 in nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties
where dryland agriculture predominates reflect a weak envi-
ronmental signal in the population data (Gutmann et al.
2005). The economic status of Great Plains agriculture has
been steadier than many would have expected, with total
inflation-adjusted gross income slightly higher and net income
somewhat lower over the long term because of increased
animal production, growing government payments, and
higher crop yields.
Researchers on both sides of this argument would agree that
regional natural ecosystems have been disrupted and de-
graded by extensive crop and livestock production on the
plains, yet they would probably disagree about whether this
threatens the long-term trajectory of agriculture. It is useful
to note that during much of the period when extensive agri-
cultural expansion took place in the Great Plains,climate con-
ditions were highly conducive to cropping systems. Given
historic cyclical patterns of drought in the region, current
agricultural practices may not be appropriate if these drought
conditions resume and persist, as has occurred in the past
(Miner 2006).
During the past five decades, the Great Plains region has
displayed long-term differential patterns for three types of
counties: metro counties, dryland nonmetro counties with
minimal irrigation,and nonmetro counties with substantial
irrigation. We separated the counties into these categories
using 1990 population census data and 1997 agricultural
census data (figure 1 shows the location of these counties
within the Great Plains). Metro counties include those that
were within a US Census­defined metropolitan area in 1990.
There was little change in the inclusion of counties in metro-
politan areas from 1980 to 2000. The 1990 definitions
effectively represent the attributes of metro counties at the end
of the 20th century.Irrigated nonmetro counties are those with
more than 50,000 acres (about 20,000 hectares [ha]) of irri-
gated,harvested cropland,and with a total harvest of irrigated
crops equal to more than 25% of the county's total cropped
area,as reported in the 1997 agricultural census.There is some
year-to-year variation in the amount of land irrigated,but the
selection of counties using 1997 criteria produces results that
are not significantly different from those using other years,
especially 1992 and 2002. Irrigated cropland in these coun-
ties constitutes nearly 74% of all irrigated cropland in the
region, substantiating our categorization. We describe the
remaining counties as dryland nonmetro.
Although this division of counties emphasizes conditions
at the end of the 20th century,we believe it is the most effective
way to capture changes in the region and to balance past
conditions with future prospects.This categorization is in con-
trast to other ways in which US counties have been divided,
and it yields a different picture of the agricultural and demo-
graphic characteristics of the region's counties.Our approach
recognizes that there is great diversity within a region as
large as the Great Plains, but that a simple classification has
the potential to produce important insights.Although the raw
materials for these data are well known, they must be as-
sembled and analyzed to help understand the past, present,
and future of this environmentally sensitive region.

Figure 1. Counties within the Great Plains region. We
classify the counties into three categories: Metro counties
are those with populations of 50,000 or more in 1990.
Irrigated nonmetro counties have 50,000 acres (about
20,000 hectares) or more of irrigated harvest cropland,
with more than 25% of the total harvested cropland irri-
gated. Dryland nonmetro counties are what remain, with
neither metro nor irrigated nonmetro characteristics. The
largest metro area is along the Front Range of the Rocky
Mountains in Colorado. Most irrigated nonmetro coun-
ties have access to water from rivers or the deep aquifers
of the region, primarily the Ogallala.
Can long-term trends in population, production, and
income reveal the region's potential for rapid change? What
has the trajectory of change been in the past? If it has largely
been one of smooth changes,what is the potential for abrupt
transformations? The answers to these questions will provide
a much better understanding of what has happened in the past,
and some insight into what might happen in the future
(although we recognize that predicting the future is extremely
difficult).
To perform this analysis, we assembled a comprehensive
Great Plains database that includes information about pop-
ulation, land use, and farm income for the region's counties
(Gutmann et al. 1998, Gutmann 2005a, 2005b, USDA n.d.).
The data came from federal censuses of population and
agricultural production (Gutmann et al. 1998, Gutmann
2005a, 2005b). State-level agricultural income data from
1949 to the present are available from the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA n.d.). To analyze net income and the
components of income, we combined data from this source
beginning in 1950 and ending in 2000 for the 10 Great Plains
states. All income and price data in this article are inflation
adjusted using the US Consumer Price Index (USDOL 2005).
Historical land-use patterns
Nearly 150 years ago, settlers of European origin arriving in
the Great Plains from other parts of the United States and
directly from Europe began the process of converting what had
been a sparsely populated open prairie into a checkerboard
of fields, pastures, and towns. Their arrival transformed the
land and the lives of its inhabitants (West 1998) but also
showed limits beyond which it would be difficult to venture,
at least in terms of converting land to agricultural uses
(Cunfer 2005, Gutmann et al. 2005). In the Great Plains--
unlike regions farther east, where woodlands yielded to the
axe and underwent a near-complete conversion to plowed
fields--low precipitation and regional soil characteristics
prevented farmers from cropping more than 70% of land in
the east and 25% in the west, an average of 50% overall.
Humans have nonetheless managed to transform the land-
scape of the Great Plains in many ways, a process that has
continued into the 20th and 21st centuries with the advent of
inorganic fertilizers and deep-well irrigation.
The 100-year historical patterns for land use in metro and
nonmetro counties (figure 2) show that total farmland area
increased rapidly from 1900 to 1945 and peaked in 1959. In
1900, metro counties were already more developed as farm-
land than nonmetro counties.Metro counties lost 25% of their
total farmland from 1959 to 1997,with more than 90% of this
farmland loss coming from rangeland. Nonmetro counties
started losing farmland in 1959,with no loss of cropland,while
rangeland declined less than 5% since 1959.Both metro and
nonmetro counties lost total harvested cropland from 1950
to 1964, and then had stable levels of harvested crop area af-
ter 1964. Most of the loss of harvested cropland from 1950
to 1964 came from reductions in harvested wheatland.Non-
metro irrigated and nonmetro dryland counties had similar
patterns of decline in harvested cropland since 1950, but the
irrigated counties lost less harvested cropland.
The different scales for the two components of figure 2
reveal just how little farmland and cropland have ever been
located in the metro counties, and therefore how little risk
there is that urbanization, and even suburbanization, will
swallow up large amounts of agricultural land in the Great
Plains. Although this is not the case in Front Range Col-
orado counties (Parton et al.2003),it is important to note for
the region as a whole. The number of metro counties in the
region has increased steadily since 1960, when there were
20 (the same number as in 1970), to 33 in 1980, 29 in 1990,
and 32 in 2000 (Ruggles et al. 2004). The increase of metro
counties shows that residences and businesses have expanded
into formerly agricultural areas, but the small number of
metro counties, and the small amount of farmland in them,
confirms our point.
Population
A number of authors have suggested that the decline and
aging of the population in nonmetro Great Plains counties
pose the potential for significant problems for the long-term
sustainability of the region (Rathge and Highman 1998,
Rowley 1998, Johnson and Rathge 2006, Leonard and
Gutmann 2005). Population in metro, dryland nonmetro,
and irrigated nonmetro counties increased from 1900 to

Figure 2. Historical land-use patterns for (a) nonmetro
and (b) metro counties in the Great Plains. Irrigated
nonmetro and dryland nonmetro counties are combined
because they have similar characteristics over time. Most
agricultural land is in nonmetro counties. The differences
in scale between metro and nonmetro counties show that
there is little risk of metro sprawl overwhelming agricul-
tural land in the Great Plains.
1930 (figure 3a). Population in dryland nonmetro counties
decreased after 1930, with a 19% reduction from 1930 to
2000.Irrigated nonmetro counties lost population from 1930
to 1940,but gained population after 1940 as irrigated harvested
land increased from 0.8 million ha in 1940 to 6.5 million ha
in 1980.In the metro counties,population increased through-
out the 100-year period,adding more than 300% since 1950.
Before 1940, there were more males (53%) than females
(47%) in the population of the whole region (irrigated and
dryland nonmetro and metro), but after 1940, the trend re-
versed, and 51% of the population were female in 2000. The
decline in the male population since 1930 caused most of the
decrease in total population of the dryland nonmetro coun-
ties,while female population has remained stable since 1940.
Despite alarms about population loss,our research shows
that the population of irrigated and dryland nonmetro coun-
ties has stabilized and perhaps increased slightly since 1960.
However,the interpretation of this finding depends on one's
point of view.The population of the United States has grown
rapidly since 1945, and has become mostly urban and
suburban. If one's standard for the Great Plains is that it
should have kept up with population growth in expanding
metro regions,then our conclusion that the region is under-
going adequate,though modest,population growth is wrong.
If one's point of view is that population stability and some
growth is a reasonable target for a rural region that is
relatively far from the coasts, then stability or slight growth
is a reasonable--and not unfavorable--conclusion.
Aging is another important concern.The proportion of the
population over age 65 (figure 3b) increased during the 100-
year period,but after 1940,the nonmetro counties experienced
a more rapid increase than the metro counties (16% for dry-
land nonmetro, 14% for irrigated nonmetro, and 10% for
metro counties in 2000). We observed similar trends in the
proportion of the population over 55 for metro and nonmetro
counties (not shown).The aging of the nonmetro population
is largely a consequence of the out-migration of the working-
age population from agricultural communities (Johnson and
Rathge 2006). This out-migration of younger cohorts has
recently had the severe secondary consequence of reducing
fertility and therefore intensifying the reduction in many
aspects of community life,especially in schools and activities
focused on children, which may lead to acceleration of
further out-migration. It remains to be seen whether the
relatively steady (and relatively young) populations of coun-
ties with irrigated agriculture will avoid the loss of their
younger population or whether the demographic changes in
these counties are only slightly slower because of improved
economic conditions and,in the long term,these counties will
begin to age as others have done.
Crop production and technology
The major harvested crops in the Great Plains are wheat,
hay,corn,and cotton.Wheat is the dominant harvested crop
(50% of the harvested land), followed by hay (20%), corn
(15%), and cotton (4%). Cotton is grown primarily in the
southern Great Plains (Texas,Oklahoma,and New Mexico).
Other important harvested crops include barley (3%),
sorghum (2%),and sugar beets (1%).Historical data (figure
4a) for the production of corn, wheat, hay, and cotton show
that before 1945, total production of these crops was stable
except for low production during the 1930s.After 1945,there
was a dramatic increase in production for all of the major
crops.Cotton production doubled from 1945 to the 1950s,and
corn,wheat,and hay production rose sharply from the 1950s
to the early 1980s. The major cause of increased production
was improved crop yield per ha, despite the reduction in
total harvested area from 1950 to the 1960s. The applica-
tions of crop technology that contributed to additional crop
yields include greater irrigation using fossil water supplies
(resulting in two to four times greater yields for irrigated
than for dryland crops in the Great Plains; Parton et al.2003),
supported by relatively inexpensive energy supplies for farm
operations, increased application of inorganic fertilizer
(figure 4c), improvements in tillage practices (Smika and
Wicks 1968) and crop varieties, greater herbicide and insec-
ticide use, and increased use of summer fallow for the wheat
system (ARS/USDA 1974).
Cotton production data (figure 4a) show a 400% increase
in cotton production since 1940. Production rose as a result
of continuous increases in yields per ha,from 0.7 bales per ha
in 1940 to 2.5 bales per ha in 1997.The primary causes for the

the influence of Denver and nearby cities. The popula-
tion of the irrigated nonmetro counties has risen slowly
through time, while that of the dryland nonmetro coun-
ties has declined slowly since 1930, stabilizing in 1990.

higher yields were the introduction of improved
crop varieties and the increased use of irrigation, inorganic
fertilizer, and insecticides. The major increase in cotton fer-
tilizer application occurred between 1940 and 1960.
The wheat data show that production was low until 1940,
increased 100% from 1940 to 1964,and went up another 100%
from 1964 to 1982.These increases were caused by wheat yields
that improved from 750 kilograms (kg) per ha in 1940 to 1300
kg per ha in 1964 and 1900 kg per ha in 1982. The yield in-
creases from 1940 to 1964 were correlated with an increase
in summer fallow (ARS/USDA 1974), improved water stor-
age in summer fallow through stubble mulching techniques
(40% increase; Smika andWicks 1968),increased application
of nitrogen fertilizer (figure 4c),and improved wheat varieties
(Quisenberry and Reitz 1974,Olmstead and Rhode 2002).The
additional yield per ha from 1964 to 1982 is correlated with
increases in nitrogen fertilizer application (figure 4c),typically
from 10 to 30 kg nitrogen per ha in 1964 to 40 to 90 kg per
ha in 1982.Wheat yields per hectare have remained stable,and
rates of nitrogen fertilizer application have increased slowly
(< 10 kg nitrogen per ha) since 1982.
Corn production was stable until 1964 and then increased
by more than 400% from 1964 to 1997 as a result of plant-
ing more land in corn (a 100% increase since 1964), which
brought about a growth in yields from 3000 kg per ha in 1964
to 7000 kg per ha in 1997. Corn yields grew because of
increased irrigation (figure 4c),improved crop varieties,and
application of nitrogen fertilizer (figure 4c),which went from
60 kg nitrogen per ha in 1964 to more than 160 kg per ha in
1980.Levels of nitrogen fertilizer application have remained
fairly steady since 1980 (Metherell et al.1995).More than 65%
of the corn production in the Great Plains is produced in the
irrigated nonmetro counties.
Hay production has also increased, primarily because of
increased yields per ha, with a 200% increase from 1950 to
1980. Improved plant varieties and increased irrigation
of hay (a 100% increase from 1950 to 1980) are the primary
factors contributing to larger hay yields. Hay yields from
irrigated land, which were approximately 100% higher than
dryland yields in 1950,were 300% to 400% higher than dry-
land yields after 1980 (Smika and Wicks 1968).
To summarize, the most important technological factors
that have contributed to all crop yield increases are increased
irrigation, pest management and fertilizer applications,
improved tillage practices,and improved plant varieties.It is
difficult to separate out the impact of each factor, because
greater fertilizer use and more irrigation occur in conjunction
with stepped-up use of herbicides and insecticides and with
continued improvement in plant varieties.
Some of the improvements in agricultural technology
have had negative environmental impacts.The expansion of
the summer fallow system for winter wheat has produced
greater losses of soil carbon (Metherell et al.1995),increased
nitrous oxide (N
2
O) fluxes from the soil (Mosier et al.1997),
and more sodic land problems. More intensive use of irriga-
tion,nitrogen fertilizer,herbicides,and insecticides has resulted
in leaching of nitrate (NO
3
), pesticide, and herbicide into
groundwater (Matson et al. 1997, Rabalais 2002), reduction
of deep aquifers and fossil water supplies, increased N
2
O
emissions (Mosier et al. 1997), and increased runoff of agri-
cultural chemicals into lakes and ponds (Matson et al. 1997,
Rabalais 2002).Future research about the long-term prospects
of Great Plains agriculture must consider the trade-off between
successful crop production and the long-term environmen-
tal impacts of agricultural systems that produce gains in crop
yields (Cassman et al. 2002, Fixen and West 2002).
The impact of historical and current land-use practices in
the Great Plains on county-level carbon budgets and fluxes
of NO
3
and N
2
O has been evaluated in two recent papers.

Parton and colleagues (2005) simulated the impact of observed
changes in land use for the last 150 years derived from county-
level agricultural census data (Gutmann 2005b) on soil
carbon levels using a set of Century model runs that repre-
sent the major land uses for each county.The major land-use
patterns represented by the model include irrigated agricul-
ture, dryland agriculture, grazed grasslands, and the Con-
servation Reserve Program.
There is a general pattern of soil carbon loss following
initiation of cultivation for 30 to 50 years,with up to 50% loss
of soil carbon (figure 5). The initiation of irrigation (figure
5a, 5b) after 1950 in the Great Plains resulted in an increase
in soil carbon for farms using corn­alfalfa rotations in the
central and northern Great Plains counties, whereas irri-
gated cotton rotations in the southern Great Plains resulted
in substantial decreases in soil carbon.Parton and colleagues
(2005) suggest that irrigated corn­alfalfa rotations in the
central and northern Great Plains have resulted in a net
carbon storage of 21.3 teragrams since 1950. Increased
carbon storage for the corn­alfalfa system results from large
increases in soil carbon inputs from alfalfa roots and corn
stover,while decreases in soil carbon for the cotton rotations
occur because of low inputs of plant residues and elevated soil
decomposition rates associated with reduced water stress,
the latter caused by irrigation of soils with high background
soil temperatures in the southern Great Plains. The dryland
nonmetro counties (figure 5c) show a pattern of slight in-
creases in system carbon since the 1960s, which result from
the transfer of cropped agricultural land to grasslands, land
converted to the Conservation Reserve Program, and im-
proved crop yields resulting from advanced cultivation prac-
tices and increased fertilizer inputs.

model run depending on the observed area represented by
each land-use practice. The observed fertilizer inputs for
each of the crops are included in the model runs.The regional
N

O gas fluxes and NO

leaching follow similar patterns
(figure 6),with both being low in the western Great Plains and
increasing rapidly eastward across North and South Dakota,
Kansas, and Nebraska. The eastward increase in NO
3
leach-
ing and N
2
O gas fluxes results from a general pattern of in-
creased cultivation: less than 30% of the land in the far
western Great Plains region is cultivated, compared with
more than 70% of the land in the far eastern part of the
Great Plains (Gutmann et al. 2004, 2005, Cunfer 2005). This
regional land-use pattern is also associated with an increase
in nitrogen fertilizer use going eastward across the Great
Plains. Nitrate leaching and N
2
O gas fluxes follow the same
pattern because both increase with greater cropping intensity
and nitrogen fertilizer application.
The other striking pattern evident in these results is a high
value for NO
3
leaching and N
2
O gas fluxes associated with the
irrigated regions in the Great Plains (cf.figure 1,figure 6).The
results show high levels of NO
3
leaching and N
2
O gas fluxes
for irrigated regions associated with the Platte River in
Nebraska, the Arkansas River in Kansas, and the Ogallala
Aquifer in western Texas.High levels of NO
3
leaching and N
2
O
gas fluxes result from the large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer
applied to irrigated agricultural systems (see figure 4c) and
the use of intense soil cultivation practices.
Market value of agricultural products
US agricultural census data for the market value of agricul-
tural products, available since 1950 (figure 7), show that the
inflation-adjusted gross income for all agricultural products
follows a similar overall pattern for the metro,irrigated non-
metro, and dryland nonmetro counties. Income was fairly
stable prior to 1964 and then increased rapidly in all coun-
ties from 1964 to 1978; more than 90% of this change came
from an increase in animal products.After 1978, there was a
steep decrease (> 90%) in total agricultural income, includ-
ing a substantial decrease (> 55%) in income from animal
products (livestock) for the metro counties. The nonmetro

decreases in total agricultural and animal product income
during the same period.In recent years (1987­1997),there has
been a slow increase in agricultural income from all sources
for the irrigated nonmetro counties. The data for the entire
Great Plains region show that the percentage of total agri-
cultural income that derived from animal products increased
from 20% in 1950 to more than 52% in 1997. The fraction
of the total agricultural income for the Great Plains that
comes from the irrigated nonmetro counties (which make up
approximately 20% of the total land area of the Great Plains)
increased from less than 20% in 1950 to more than 50% in
1997. The large increases in the value of animal products
and in total agricultural income for the irrigated nonmetro
counties occurred from 1964 to 1978, in conjunction with a
dramatic increase in irrigated land planted with corn and in
corn yields (figure 4). These counties provide 65% of total
Great Plains corn production.
Inflation-adjusted values for crop income for the metro and
nonmetro counties were steady from 1950 to 1997 (figure 7),
but there was an increasing trend in crop income for irrigated
nonmetro counties. All three groups of counties had their
highest income from crops in 1978, a result of high crop
prices at that time.The relatively steady value for crop income
from 1950 to 1997 is largely a result of large increases in crop
yields (figure 4b). The total area of harvested cropland de-
creased slightly during this period,and the inflation-adjusted
value of a bushel of corn or wheat decreased by more than half
since 1950 (Olmstead and Rhode 2006a, 2006b).
These agricultural census data only represent gross in-
come from agricultural activities. They do not reflect ex-
penses incurred in producing the crop, nor income from
other activities. Nevertheless, they are the only county-level
data that are readily available. State-level inflation-adjusted
net farm income data for the Great Plains (USDA n.d.) gen-
erally follow the same trend (figure 8),with two significant ex-
ceptions. Since the 1950s, both government payments to
farmers and the proportion of farm income spent on agri-
cultural inputs for crop and animal production have in-
creased.The increased expenses resulted from large increases
in agricultural inputs (fertilizer, herbicides, insecticides, and
energy use), which accounted for 30% of gross farm income
in 1949,compared with more than 60% of gross farm income
during the 1990s.The increased cost of agricultural inputs has

income is the increase in government payment to farmers,
which was minimal in the 1950s and has increased to more
than 60% since the 1980s. Like irrigation, government pay-
ments diminish the risks associated with farming, although
increased costs have raised those risks.
Past, present, future
It is difficult to make accurate predictions of future trends for
land use, population, and agricultural economic return, but
analysis of the historical data suggests trends that are likely to
continue into the future.The data used in this article encourage
separate analyses of population, agricultural productivity,
agricultural income,and environmental outcomes,yet these
topics are thoroughly, if imperfectly, intertwined. Histori-
cally,population growth has spurred agricultural development,
production, and income, and it still does so at national and
global levels. However, in the 21st century at the local level,
population growth rarely leads to increases in agricultural
input or output,and population decline also has little impact
on agriculture.Conversely,agriculture has become so mech-
anized and efficient, and salaries for agricultural work so
low, that growth or stability in agricultural productivity
and income can preserve population stability but does not
lead to growth. Metro and suburban dwellers also object to
livestock-oriented agricultural activities--often the most
profitable of agricultural enterprises--near their homes.On
the other hand,changes in the nonmetro population appear
to be driven partly by changes in agriculture,which is why pop-
ulations in the irrigated nonmetro counties have remained
larger than those in the dryland nonmetro counties.There is
more farm and nonfarm work where irrigation prevails,and
that has helped sustain populations.
The connections go beyond the straightforward and eco-
nomically driven ways that population and agriculture in-
fluence each other.Land-use practices,many of them directly
tied to farming, contribute to environmental change. The
growth of population in the metro counties has been largely
exogenous to the agricultural economy in recent years,but it
does have an impact on agriculture. Metro and suburban
development takes land from agriculture and water from
irrigation. On the other hand, if forecasts of world popula-
tion growth are correct (Tilman et al. 2001, Howarth et al.
2002),the Great Plains could experience increases in cropland,
production on existing cropland, and animal production.
Notwithstanding these links between population and agri-
culture, most of the changes in farming are not caused by

changes in population. Largely external forces have changed
farming, including dramatic shifts in weather (in the 1930s)
and prices (in the 1970s) and, more generally, changes in
technology and in the external market forces that affect prices
for the inputs farmers use and the products they sell. There
is no simple synthesis that links population,agriculture,and
environment in the US Great Plains, but the story told here
shows the many ways in which these factors have come to-
gether and shaped one another since the 19th century. Even
if we initially separate out each factor,any conclusions we draw
about prospective outcomes make sense only when they are
combined.
Population trends are in some ways the most independent
factor in regional change, because the population has been
growing rapidly for a long time throughout the United States,
mostly in metro regions. The Great Plains region is no ex-
ception. Metro population growth in the Great Plains could
continue and may accelerate in the future. On the other
hand, the population of the dryland nonmetro counties has
stabilized during the last 30 years, while that of the irrigated
nonmetro counties has increased slightly,and the proportion
of the population over ages 55 and 65 in both dryland and ir-
rigated nonmetro counties has grown rapidly.While this sta-
bility is reassuring, virtually all other US populations are
growing. These demographic patterns will bring substantial
social change to the plains.A static, aging population will be
even more different from the dominant metro United States
in the future than it is now. All of these trends are likely to
continue.
Data on agricultural income also show trends that have the
potential to persist,and that pose significant challenges for the
future. The dominant trend of the last 30 years has been an
increase in income from animal production for the non-
metro counties. In the metro counties, on the other hand,
income from animal production fell sharply and then stabi-
lized in relation to crop production in the past 20 years.This
trend is likely to continue,because growing metro populations
have concerns about the air and water pollution produced by
intensive animal production (Mosier et al.1997,Howarth et
al. 2002). Income in both metro and nonmetro counties is
also at risk, as the ratio of net to gross income has fallen and
government payments have increased.The recent increase in
the cost of petroleum and natural gas will push the cost of
inputs still higher,and the potential that government payments
may be reduced will lower incomes.
Plans to develop biofuels from crop residue, and to use
corn to produce ethanol and oil seed to produce biodiesel
(Barrionuevo 2006), have the potential to contribute to a
shift in crop selection in the future and will lead to a new
period of uncertainty. The irrigated agricultural counties
have the greatest short-term potential to respond to a higher
demand for corn. The dryland nonmetro counties also have
the potential to gain from the use of plant residues to
produce ethanol. At the same time, demand for corn for
biofuels will raise prices,which has the potential to affect live-
stock production.Higher prices for animal feed,and for fuel
to transport the feed to livestock and the livestock to processing
plants,can lead to lowered incomes in the livestock sector.Ex-
panded biofuel production could also lead to adverse envi-
ronmental impacts such as increased soil erosion and reduced
soil carbon.
Potential water shortages are another major threat to the
future of the Great Plains. Aquifers are declining (Kromm
and White 1986, Lehe 1986, Wilhite 1988), metro growth is
taking water from agriculture,and climate change poses a sub-
stantial risk, although its impacts may not all be negative
(Reilly et al. 2001, Ojima et al. 2002). Responses to potential
water shortages include improvement of dryland cropping
systems (Peterson et al.1998,Del Grosso et al.2002) to reduce
fallow frequency, and more efficient irrigation methods.
Although these changes are likely to be widely implemented,
it is unclear whether improved irrigation efficiency,better crop
management practices,and reduction in plant transpiration
levels associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels will allow crop yields to be maintained at current lev-
els. It is likely that these and other improved agricultural
techniques will reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on
the environment. These techniques, coupled with programs
like the Conservation Reserve Program (which encourages
farmers to convert cropland to grassland), can increase car-
bon storage and reduce N
2
O soil fluxes and NO
3
leaching.
This research draws on the assumption that there are
meaningful observations to be drawn from the experience of
the Great Plains over the past century,with special consider-
ation of the past 30 or 40 years. There are fundamental dif-
ferences in the viability of agriculture and agricultural society
in the three areas we have defined, with metro and dryland
nonmetro counties more likely than irrigated nonmetro
counties to run into problems.Irrigated nonmetro areas may
prove vulnerable because of the increased cost of pumping
water from deeper reaches of the aquifer, the increased
water demands due to greater evapotranspiration under a
warmer climate,and the increased competition with human
consumption in metro areas for water resources.At present,
however,the conditions in terms of population and produc-
tion are not as bad as they might be, and not as bad as some
observers suggest.There is little recent evidence to suggest that
the near future will be different from the recent past, but the
prospect of high energy costs and reduced government pay-
ments to farms may disrupt what has been a quarter-century
of stability.The expanded use of crops for biofuel production
has the potential to increase rural incomes through higher crop
prices (corn prices have increased by 175% during the last
year) and industrial incomes through the construction and
operation of ethanol biorefineries.We see few indications on
the horizon that agricultural production will decline sharply,
or that patterns of population change will depart radically
from those in place since the 1970s and 1980s. The prospect
of new trends in petroleum prices,the reduced availability of
water for irrigation, and new departures from recent demo-
graphic patterns are all cause for continued monitoring.
