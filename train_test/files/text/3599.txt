Abstract: An experiment was conducted to explore the effects of exposure to partner
scarcity or abundance messages on men's partner selectivity, romantic confidence, and
self-assessed attractiveness. Undergraduate male participants watched a soap opera
narrative featuring either two men competing over one potential female partner (partner
scarcity) or two women competing over one potential male partner (partner abundance).
Relative to control subjects, watching either narrative reduced romantic confidence.
Experimental condition also affected partner selectivity and self-assessed attractiveness,
though both effects were moderated by endorsement of traditional masculine ideology.
Viewing the abundance narrative resulted in greater selectivity and self-assessed
attractiveness for men high in endorsement of traditional masculinity but diminished
selectivity and self-assessed attractiveness for men low in endorsement of traditional
masculine identity.
Keywords: sex; partner selectivity; media effects.

Introduction
A growing body of research has demonstrated that sex ratio influences partner
selectivity. Much of this research has taken the form of population-level research
comparing men's attitudes and behavior around romantic partnering between areas with
differing sex ratios. This research has demonstrated that men's partner selectivity increases
when the proportion of women in the population increases (Abramitzky, Delavande, and
Vasconcelos, 2010). This selectivity has been operationalized in diverse ways. Research
comparing regions in China with varied sex ratios has demonstrated that when available
female partners are relatively more abundant, men are less likely to engage commercial sex
workers, although they are likely to engage in more and more frequent sexual encounters
outside of marriage (South and Trent, 2010); avoiding partnering that includes an explicit
financial cost constitutes greater selectivity. Other research indicates that when available
Partner selectivity and the media

female partners are relatively scarce, men are more likely to marry young, presumably
motivated to secure an available partner against relatively less certain future mating
opportunities (Kruger and Schlemmer, 2009); men are less likely to avoid partners who
insist on marriage, indicating relatively lower selectivity. This also results in women
marrying younger in populations characterized by sex ratios that skew male (Kruger,
Fitzgerald, and Peterson, 2010).
Although such studies document important and clear patterns, experimental
exploration may provide added insight. Recent research, for example, examined women's
preferences for facial symmetry in men after viewing images of crowds in which sex ratios
varied, revealing that women became more selective in their preferences when they
perceived an abundance of men (Watkins, et al., 2012). The present study seeks to extend
experimental exploration of the impact of sex ratios in two ways: first, it examines the
impact on men, and second, it examines the effects of sex ratios in media narratives rather
than either real populations or still images.
Partner selectivity can refer to choosing or avoiding partners based on any desirable
or undesirable trait or series of traits. Some research has documented selective preferences
organized around social status or resources
This preference for greater physical beauty in mating partners is likely derived from
links between physical beauty and reproductive fitness and the reproductive potential of
offspring. Some aspects of physical beauty are readily understood to be linked to such
fitness; low waist-to-hip ratio in women has been linked both to physical ability to
procreate and to greater perceived attractiveness by members of the opposite sex (Singh,
1993). Physical beauty may also signal overall fitness and reproductive potential (Etcoff,
2000). Even if it does not signal broader reproductive fitness, inasmuch as attractive
individuals attract more partners or resources, attractiveness confers an evolutionary
advantage by increasing likely reproductive success for the attractive individual as well as
their progeny (see Fisher, 1930). The use of physical beauty as a signal for other desirable
traits is also widespread; attractive individuals are consistently perceived to be more
capable, skilled, intelligent, and socially adept than are less attractive individuals (Asch,
1946; Dion, Berscheid, and Walster, 1972; Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991).
Inasmuch as sex ratio influences partner selectivity, that selectivity is likely to manifest as
differential selectivity based on physical attractiveness.
(see Pollett and Nettle, 2008), but for both men
and women, selectivity frequently refers to the requirements or expectations of physical
attractiveness for potential partners. Among men, the physical attractiveness of a potential
romantic or sexual partner is a key determinant of interest in that partner; more physically
attractive individuals are more appealing as romantic and sexual partners (Kurzban and
Weeden, 2005; Sprecher, 1989; Sprecher, Quintin, and Hatfield, 1994). Selectivity, then, as
applied to physical appearance, means that more selective men set a higher standard of
physical attractiveness for potential partners (Back et al., 2011; Buston and Emlen, 2003).
The theory of biological markets offers insight into how considerations of sex ratio
influence romantic and sexual partnering. Market theory states that partner choice in
mating, as in other reciprocal or mutual relationships, is strongly governed by
considerations of supply and demand (Noe and Hammerstein, 1994). The law of supply and
demand states that where demand remains static, as the supply of a good increases, the
Partner selectivity and the media

value of that good declines. Thus, a surplus of available partners of one sort results in
greater potential selectivity among complementary partners as the value of each is
somewhat diminished. In the present case of men's selectivity regarding physical
appearance in sexual and romantic relationships, this principle of supply and demand
would be expected to result in men's standards of attractiveness increasing as sex ratios
become more skewed in men's favor (i.e., more women than men).
Given that time and resources that can be devoted to seeking, securing, and
supporting a partner are finite, to optimize reproductive success, m
Although past research has generally focused on sex ratios in populations, there is
reason to believe that mediated depictions of skewed sex ratios may also influence partner
selection. Mediated images and narratives depicting skewed sex ratios have, for example,
been shown to influence women's partner selectivity and trait preferences (Taylor, 2011;
Watkins et al., 2012). The impact on men is less clear; exploring the same is the object of
the present study. Representations suggesting the scarcity or abundance of potential
partners for men are common in popular media. Romantic comedies, for example, use the
`love triangle' as a staple plot device. Male characters sometimes compete over a single
potential female partner (e.g., Win a Date with Tad Hamilton, Bridget Jones's Diary),
suggesting partner scarcity for men in the audience. Other media depict women competing
over a single potential male partner (e.g., My Best Friend's Wedding, The Wedding
Planner), suggesting partner abundance for men in the audience. Inasmuch as media
content has been found to influence perceptions of social reality (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009;
Gutierres, Kenrick, and Partch, 1999; Taylor, 2011; Ward, 2003), at least in the short term,
it was hypothesized that exposure to media messages about partner scarcity or abundance
would influence men's partner selectivity. Specifically, it was hypothesized that men
exposed to messages depicting a scarcity of romantic partners would be relatively less
selective regarding potential romantic and sexual partners, whereas those exposed to
messages depicting an abundance of romantic partners would be relatively more selective.
en would be expected to
have evolved a tendency to seek the highest-value partner possible. An environment
characterized by abundant partners would mean a greater supply, facilitating greater
potential selectivity. Men who respond to such situations by applying greater selectivity
would tend to secure more attractive partners and produce, on average, more attractive and
healthier offspring, improving reproductive fitness. On the other hand, an environment
characterized by scarce partners would mean a diminished supply, suggesting diminished
selectivity. Men who respond to such situations by being less selective would have a
greater likelihood of securing a mate and passing on their genes, at least relative to men
who, in the same circumstances, maintained a higher degree of selectivity. Indeed, research
has documented that in environments with skewed sex ratios, those in the scarce sex are
more selective when choosing partners (Abramitzky et al., 2010; Kruger and Schlemmer,
2009; South and Trent, 2010), and recent experimental research has shown that perceived
sex ratios shape that selectivity (Watkins et al., 2012).
Another aspect of partner selection likely to function in tandem with selectivity is
romantic confidence. Romantic confidence (RC) is defined as the perception of one's own
worth as a romantic or sexual partner as well as expectations of others' estimation of that
worth. RC is, therefore, the degree to which one is assured one can attract desirable
Partner selectivity and the media
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -39-
romantic or sexual partners (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009). Evidence suggests that RC
influences the nature of romantic and sexual relationships that men pursue (Penke, Todd,
Lenton, and Fasolo, 2007). For example, in one study, men who perceived themselves as
having higher value as romantic partners were more likely to exhibit a preference for short-
term partnering strategies, especially with relatively more physically attractive partners,
than were men with less self-perceived mate value (Landolt, Lalumiere, and Quinsey,
1995).
RC may also be sensitive to partner scarcity or abundance. Relatively more
abundant partnering opportunities would be expected to increase RC as men recognized
their increased value in the romantic-partner marketplace. Conversely, as partners become
scarce, men would realize that their value was diminished and experience less RC.
Inasmuch as RC shapes mating behavior, having RC that is responsive to partner scarcity
or abundance would confer a reproductive advantage over nonresponsive RC as men
responded more quickly or effectively to changing sex ratios. Past research has found that
men's RC is influenced by cues pertaining to mate availability; in one study, men who saw
images of highly attractive women experienced diminished RC (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009).
It was therefore hypothesized that men exposed to messages depicting a scarcity of
romantic partners would exhibit relatively lower RC, whereas men exposed to messages
depicting an abundance of romantic partners would exhibit relatively greater RC.
Another outcome likely related to both perceptions of partner scarcity or abundance
and RC is self-perceived attractiveness. Physical attractiveness has been shown to be linked
to partner selectivity among women (Little and Mannion, 2006) and more physically
attractive men tend to exhibit greater selectivity in choosing romantic partners (Back et al.,
2011; Buston and Emlen, 2003). Men who perceive themselves as relatively less attractive
have also been found to be more likely to consider less attractive women as potential
romantic and sexual partners (Stroebe, Insko, Thompson, and Layton, 1971). This pattern
tends to result in assortative mating, as most dating and married couples are roughly
comparable in their degree of attractiveness (Buss and Barnes, 1986; Watson et al., 2004).
Furthermore, past research has found that exposure to select types of media content result
in both diminished RC and negative body image in men (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009) and
diminished partner selectivity and negative self-assessments of attractiveness in women
(Little and Mannion, 2006). Self-perceived attractiveness may contribute to the arrival at
the optimal or appropriate degree of selectivity for reproduction; knowing one's value in
the biological marketplace allows one to respond to market conditions, as it were, more
appropriately. Men exposed to messages depicting a scarcity of romantic partners were
therefore expected to perceive themselves as relatively less physically attractive, whereas
men exposed to messages depicting an abundance of romantic partners were expected to
perceive themselves as relatively more physically attractive.
Importantly, other factors are likely to moderate the impact of perceived partner
scarcity or abundance on partner selectivity and RC. Past research has demonstrated, for
example, that various traits identified with masculinity such as height (Buunk, Park,
Zurriaga, Klavina, and Massar, 2008), 2D:4D digit ratio (Park, Wieling, Buunk, and
Massar, 2008), and social dominance (Watkins, Jones, and DeBruine, 2010) are associated
with decreased sensitivity to mate competition cues in the environment. Similar traits may
Partner selectivity and the media

make men less likely to respond to sex ratio cues, or to respond in a different manner. Such
variation in responsiveness is, essentially, adaptive; men high in social dominance may be
able to secure more desirable partners under diverse circumstances, even in relatively
partner-scarce environments.
One trait that has been linked to a range of outcomes related to sex and partnering is
endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology (TMI). TMI involves a constellation of
beliefs about male gender roles, including expectations for male dominance, strength,
competence, and sexual assertiveness. Endorsement of TMI has been found to be
associated with a greater number of sexual partners (Pleck, Sonenstein, and Ku, 1993), less
emotionally intimate relationships (Pleck et al., 1993), lower quality relationships (Tager
and Good, 2005; Wade and Donis, 2007), negative attitudes towards condom use (Noar and
Morokoff, 2002; Pleck et al., 1993), and attitudes more accepting of aggression against
one's romantic or sexual partner (Fitzpatrick, Salgado, Suvak, King, and King, 2004). Each
of these seems to reflect an expectation of partner abundance. It is therefore possible that
such expectations may moderate the impact of exposure to media messages regarding
partner abundance or scarcity. A question was therefore posed as to how endorsement of
TMI would influence the impact of partner abundance or scarcity messages on partner
selectivity, RC, and self-perceived attractiveness.
To test these hypotheses and explore this research question, the following
experiment was conducted.
Materials and Methods
Sample
Participants were 121 male college undergraduates who participated in exchange for
a small amount of extra credit in introductory communication courses. Mean age of
participants was 21.64 (SD = 2.41).
Procedure
Participants were recruited for a study of `reactions to media content.' After
arriving at the study site, participants read and signed an informed consent form and were
then presented with a short questionnaire. After completing measures of demographics,
media preferences, and media use, participants were told that they would watch a pair of
short media presentations to which they would be asked to respond. A video presentation
was then shown on a large-screen television. After each, participants were asked to respond
to the media content, indicating their familiarity with the program or film and the degree to
which they perceived it as interesting, engaging, and enjoyable. Participants were then
given an additional questionnaire and told that it would allow greater insight into their
reaction to the media content. This second questionnaire, in addition to filler items,
included measures of romantic confidence, romantic selectivity, and self-reported physical
attractiveness. After completing all measures, participants were debriefed, thanked, and
dismissed.
Research protocols and materials were approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the author's university before data collection began.

Stimuli
Stimuli were narratives from a British soap opera East Enders. This source was
chosen for the development of the experimental stimuli because it was assumed that U.S.
participants would be unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and even the actors, thus
reducing the likelihood that other associations or prior knowledge would confound the
effects of either stimulus. Two 10-minute narratives were used. Participants in the partner
scarcity condition viewed a story of two male characters pursuing the same woman; one is
a co-worker, the other her boyfriend. The two men are shown flirting with her, vying for
her affection, and engaging in some minor deception and violence to one-up one another.
Participants in the partner abundant condition watched a story of two women arguing over
one man, each vowing loyalty to and love for that one man. One woman was his estranged
wife for whom he seems to still have feelings, the other his current romantic and sexual
partner. Participants in the control condition watched narratives with no romantic or sexual
relationship content; specifically, they watched a movie trailer for a nature documentary
and a cartoon featuring an androgynous squirrel obsessing over an acorn.
Pre-testing with participants drawn from the same population as the study sample
found the soap opera narratives in the two experimental conditions to be comparable in the
degree to which they were enjoyable, t (26) = .56, p = .58, and romantic, t (26) = .89, p =
.38.
Measures
Relationship status was measured as participants were asked to indicate the level of
commitment in their current romantic relationship, from 0 (single, not involved
romantically with anyone) to 6 (married). An option to indicate `other' was also available,
but unused by any participant. Most participants reported being either not dating anyone (n
= 45, 37.2%) or dating one or more person casually (n = 24, 19.8%). The rest reported
seriously dating one person exclusively (n = 36, 29.8%) or cohabiting or being engaged or
married to a single partner (n = 16, 13.2%). For purposes of analyses, individuals in
committed, long-term relationships (e.g., dating exclusively and seriously or more serious)
were analyzed as one group, individuals in casual or no relationship as another.
Endorsement of TMI was measured using the male role attitudes scale (Pleck,
Sonenstein, and Ku, 1993). This instrument consists of 8 statements regarding masculine
roles (e.g., "Men are always ready for sex," "A guy will lose respect if he talks about his
problems," and "It bothers me when a guy acts like a girl"). Participants responded to each
on a 4-item scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Responses from all 8
items were averaged to form a single measure of TMI (M = 2.54, SD = .52,  = .74). For
purposes of analysis, this was dichotomized using a median split, resulting in a group
relatively low in endorsement of TMI and a group relatively high in the same.
Selectivity in romantic and sexual partners was measured as participants were asked
to set a minimum standard of attractiveness for such partners. Specifically, participants
were asked to indicate, using a 10-point scale, the "lowest degree of attractiveness
acceptable for a woman" for her to be considered for a dating relationship (M = 6.51, SD =
1.44), sexual intercourse (M = 6.10, SD = 1.53), and marriage (M = 7.08, SD = 1.52).
Romantic confidence was measured in a manner similar to that employed by
Partner selectivity and the media
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -42-
Aubrey and Taylor (2009) and Hirt, Zillmann, Erickson, and Kennedy (1992). Participants
were presented with images of four attractive, young, adult women and asked to anticipate
the pictured individual's response to three social overtures. Specifically, they were asked to
estimate the likelihood that each woman would talk with them if they approached her after
a class, the likelihood that she would let them buy her a drink at a bar if they asked, and the
likelihood that she would go on a date (i.e., dinner and a movie) if asked. Responses were
made on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely). The 12 items were
averaged, resulting in a measure of romantic confidence (M = 3.29, SD = .81,  = .93).
Self-perceived attractiveness was measured with a single item in which participants
were asked to rate their own attractiveness on a 10-point scale, with higher scores reflecting
greater attractiveness (M = 7.31, SD = 1.24). Past research has demonstrated the validity of
similar 10-point ratings of physical attractiveness (Lee, Loewenstein, Ariely, Hong, and
Young, 2008).
Results
A mixed-factor MANOVA was employed to explore the impact of partner scarcity
and abundance messages on partner selectivity. Between-subjects factors were
experimental condition (control vs. scarce partners vs. abundant partners) and endorsement
of TMI (low vs. high). The within-subjects factor was relationship type for the partner for
which a standard was indicated (date vs. marry vs. have sex with). Relationship status was
employed as a covariate.
In this analysis, the test of within-subjects effects indicated a main effect for
relationship type, F (2, 228) = 26.20, p < .001. Planned post-hoc comparisons, adjusted for
multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction, indicated that this reflected
significantly lower standards of attractiveness for a sex partner (M = 6.12, SD = 1.54) than
for either a dating partner (M = 6.56, SD= 1.35) or a marriage partner (M = 7.09, SD =
1.41). Participants were also significantly less selective regarding a dating partner than a
marriage partner. There was no significant interaction between the within-subjects factor
and experimental condition, F (4, 228) = 1.18, p = .32 or between the within-subjects factor
and experimental condition and endorsement of TMI, F (4, 228) = .38, p = .82.
Examining between-subjects effects, a main effect for endorsement of TMI was
observed, F (1, 114) = 4.89, p < .05, reflective of relatively greater selectivity among men
who more strongly endorsed TMI (M = 6.84, SD = 1.30, and M = 6.35, SD = 1.21,
respectively). Although there was no main effect of experimental condition on selectivity,
the interaction between condition and endorsement of TMI was significant, F (2, 114) =
11.55, p < .001. Planned post-hoc comparisons within each TMI group indicated that,
among men who endorsed lower levels of TMI, participants in both the partner scarce
condition (M = 6.24, SD = 1.24) and the partner abundant condition (M = 5.62, SD = 1.23)
exhibited significantly less selectivity than participants in the control condition (M = 7.22,
SD = .122). Among participants higher in endorsement of TMI, those in the abundant
partner condition (M = 7.57, SD = 1.24) exhibited greater selectivity than those in the
scarce partner condition (M = 6.47, SD = 1.23), though neither differed significantly from
the control condition (M = 6.54, SD = 1.23).

ANOVA was employed to examine effects of experimental manipulation on RC
and self-perceived attractiveness. In each case, factors were experimental condition (control
vs. scarce partners vs. abundant partners) and endorsement of TMI (low vs. high).
Relationship status was employed as a covariate.
A main effect of experimental condition on RC was observed, F (2, 114) = 5.19, p <
.01. Planned post-hoc comparisons with the Bonferroni correction indicated that
participants in both the scarce-partner condition (M = 3.06, SD = .83) and the abundant-
partner condition (M = 3.24, SD = .82) exhibited significantly less romantic confidence
than participants in the control condition (M = 3.60, SD = .78). The difference between the
scarce- and abundant-partner conditions was not statistically significant. The interaction
between experimental condition and endorsement of TMI approached, but did not achieve,
significance, F (2, 114) = 2.83, p = .063.
A main effect of experimental condition on self-assessments of attractiveness was
also observed, F (2, 114) = 3.38, p < .05. Participants in the scarce partner condition (M =
7.01, SD = 1.16) viewed themselves as significantly less attractive than participants in the
control condition (M = 7.67, SD = 1.14), with the abundant partner resulting in self-
assessments significantly different from both (M = 7.35, SD = 1.15). This main effect was
qualified, however, by a significant interaction between experimental condition and
endorsement of TMI, F (2, 114) = 8.96, p < .001. Planned post-hoc comparisons within
each TMI group indicated that among men with lower endorsement of TMI, participants in
the abundant partner condition (M = 6.54, SD = 1.13) viewed themselves as significantly
less attractive than participants in the control condition (M = 7.67, SD = 1.16), with the
scarce partner resulting in self-assessments significantly different from both (M = 7.06, SD
= 1.08). Among participants high in endorsement of TMI, however, participants in the
abundant partner condition viewed themselves as significantly more attractive (M = 8.17,
SD = 1.16) than participants in the scarce partner condition (M = 6.97, SD = 1.16), though
neither differed significantly from the control participants (M = 7.48, SD = 1.14).
Mediation analysis was conducted to explore a possible meditational role of self-
assessed attractiveness and RC on partner selectivity. The bootstrapping technique
advocated by Preacher and Hayes (2004) was employed.
In order to account for the moderating role of TMI, two separate mediation analyses
were conducted, one for low-TMI participants and one for high-TMI participants. In each
case, experimental condition was recoded employing `effect coding,' so that the abundance
condition was coded `1,' the partner scarce condition `-1,' and the control condition `0'.
Both RC and self-assessed attractiveness were entered as potential mediators, partner
selectivity as the dependent variable, and relationship status as a covariate. 1000 bootstrap
samples were employed for each analysis. Bias-corrected confidence intervals for the
indirect effect of condition on selectivity through each proposed mediator were calculated
for each; where the confidence interval does not include zero, the indirect effect is
significant and the overall relationship is mediated by the proposed mediator.
For participants high in TMI, self-assessed attractiveness partially mediated the
effect of experimental condition on partner selectivity (95% CI: .10, .58); RC did not (95%
CI: -.11, .14). For participants low in TMI, neither self-assessed attractiveness (95% CI: -
.43, .029) nor RC (95% CI: -.20, .023) significantly mediated the effect of condition on

selectivity.
Discussion
In a laboratory experiment, viewing media representations of partner scarcity and
abundance in the form of soap opera narratives was shown to influence the partner
selectivity, RC, and self-assessed physical attractiveness of male undergraduates. This was
moderated by endorsement of traditional masculine ideology.
Romantic confidence was observed to be influenced by viewing representations of
partner scarcity and abundance. Consistent with expectations, men who viewed a soap
opera narrative that emphasized the scarcity of available, appropriate female romantic
partners by depicting male competition over a single prospective mate exhibited less
romantic confidence than men who watched no romantic narrative. Contrary to
expectations, however, watching a narrative that inverted the pattern, showing female
competition over a single prospective male partner, also resulted in relatively lower
romantic confidence. One possible explanation lies in the nature of both narratives. Each
narrative, for example, dealt with complex, difficult romantic relationships. Men viewing
either presentation might have been reminded of the difficulties of such relationships and
therefore lost confidence in their ability to successfully conduct them. In some ways, this
echoes the findings of Taylor (2011), who observed a general effect of romantic narratives
on women's partner preferences that was, for some outcomes, independent of the sex ratios
of the characters in those narratives. In this case, watching romantic soap opera narratives
affects men's romantic confidence, generally reducing that confidence.
Alternately, affect may play a role. Past research has documented a link between
affect and self-views (Daskalou and Syngollitou, 2007; Ebbeck, Watkins, Concepcion,
Cardinal, and Hammermeister, 2009). Diminished romantic confidence may be associated
with less positive or more negative affect; this change in affective state may then result in
lower self-assessment. Future research of the impact of romantic portrayals on self-
assessments of attractiveness might benefit from measuring affect.
The impact of experimental condition on both partner selectivity and self-assessed
physical attractiveness were more complex, as each was dependent on endorsement of
TMI. Among participants high in TMI endorsement, H1 was supported (i.e., watching the
narrative depicting women competing over the same man's romantic and sexual attention
resulted in greater selectivity as participants set a higher threshold of attractiveness for
potential romantic and sexual partners relative to the participants who watched the partner
scarcity narrative). In contrast to what was observed among men high in TMI endorsement,
among men low in endorsement of TMI, watching either romantic narrative resulted in
lower partner selectivity.
The moderating role of TMI was also observed in the effects of experimental
condition on self-assessments of physical attractiveness. This interaction echoed the pattern
observed for RC. Among participants low in endorsement of TMI, men who viewed the
partner abundant narrative assessed themselves as less attractive than men with comparable
endorsement of TMI who watched no such narrative. Among participants higher in TMI,
viewing the abundance narrative resulted in higher self-assessed attractiveness relative to
Partner selectivity and the media
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -45-
watching the scarcity narrative. Importantly, this is the first time sex ratio has been linked
to self-assessed physical attractiveness in men.
In the case of both partner selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness, then, men
high in TMI responded in ways consistent with the hypotheses derived from population-
level studies of sex ratio and partner choice. Men low in TMI, however, demonstrated
effects in the opposite direction, with reduced selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness
in response to depictions of abundant partners. Several possible explanations must be
considered. First, for men low in endorsement of TMI, this may reflect increased salience
of romantic relationships in general--the narrative's emphasis on them and their difficulty
makes them more salient, more important, and therefore more relevant. Such salience may
contribute to reduced selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness in a number of ways.
First, the increased perceived importance of romantic relationships may result in a
commensurate increase in the perceived importance of securing such a relationship, which
becomes more likely if standards for potential partners are lowered. Second, this added
salience of romantic relationships in the context of reduced RC may result in a
generalization of the diminished RC to the self in general, resulting in a diminished sense
of self-worth, including physical attractiveness, and a commensurate diminishment of
standards for one's partner.
An additional explanation may be found in the particular character of the content
and its intersection with elements of TMI. The important trait of each narrative for the sake
of the stated hypotheses was the depiction of scenarios in which multiple members of one
sex were available as romantic and sexual partners for a member of the opposite sex.
However, in doing so, the narratives also each depicted an established romantic couple
(engaged and married, respectively) and a potential outside romantic or sexual potential
partner. This may have caused infidelity and mate competition, rather than sex ratio, to
become more salient for some participants. Patterns of sexual relationships for men high in
endorsement of TMI, such as a greater number of lifetime sexual partners, less emotionally
intimate relationships (Pleck, Sonenstein, and Ku, 1993), and a tendency to value physical
appearance more heavily in potential partners (Sibley and Overall, 2011), may suggest a
distinct response to thoughts of mate competition. The individual high in TMI may think of
mate competition scenarios as opportunities for successful competition or extra-partner
coupling rather than indications that relationships are difficult. Past research on partner
competition has found that men often respond to mate competition scenarios in which
multiple men compete over a single female with elevated attention and arousal (Pound,
2002).
Mediation analysis indicated that the effects of exposure to partner abundance and
scarcity narratives on partner selectivity was at least partially mediated by self-perceived
attractiveness, at least for men high in endorsement of TMI. One possible explanation is
that, for more dominant men, self-perceived attractiveness functions as a mechanism to
increase selectivity. As these men see women competing over scarce male partners, their
assessment of their own attractiveness and value increases, which in turn contributes to
higher selectivity. It is also possible that social comparison plays a role, and that seeing
multiple men competing over a single woman provides salient models for upward
comparison, resulting in a diminished sense of one's attractiveness and, therefore,

selectivity regarding partners.
Evolutionary psychology has offered explanations as to why partnering strategies
including selectivity should be expected to vary with partner scarcity or availability (see
Buss and Barnes, 1986). This responsive selectivity has, indeed, been observed in various
populations (Abramitzky et al., 2010; South and Trent, 2010). The present study suggests
that, at least for some, these shifts can be elicited by mediated representations of scarcity or
abundance as well as real-world shifts in partner availability. Importantly, however, this
variation in selectivity only conformed to patterns outlined in the research literature among
men who scored relatively high in endorsement of TMI. Furthermore, at least one
phenomenon was closely related to partner selectivity, namely RC, and did not conform to
this pattern at all; partner abundance produced the same response as partner scarcity.
Although media content apparently functions as an environmental cue for evolved
behavioral shifts in some cases, the nature of what is cued apparently varies across
individuals. This may reflect the naturally occurring variation of preferred reproductive and
partnering strategies between individuals (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000); indeed, TMI
endorsement may be associated with one strategy more than another.
Another implication of these findings is that research on media influences on men's
body image should investigate a broader range of content types. Much of the research on
men's body image has focused on muscular-ideal images such as those found in muscle
magazines (Jonason, Krcmar, and Sohn, 2009) or video games (Harrison and Bond, 2007).
Several studies have also investigated the impact of sexualized images of women (Aubrey
and Taylor, 2009), which images are generally directed at male audiences. Although the
present study looks at self-assessment of attractiveness generally rather than body-image
specifically, it is likely that self-assessment of body composition or shape as well as related
cognitions and emotions is part of that assessment. After all, although the genres of media
programming likely to have the most salient romantic narratives, including partner scarcity
or abundance narratives, may be directed towards principally female audiences, men watch
and enjoy romantic comedies and soap operas (Harris, Hoekstra, Scott, Sanborn, and
Dodds, 2004).
Overall, these findings echo past research in showing that media content can
influence men's romantic confidence, generally by hampering that confidence.
Furthermore, they suggest that men with different perspectives on traditional masculine
ideology are influenced differently by romantic narratives in terms of romantic confidence
and related constructs.
