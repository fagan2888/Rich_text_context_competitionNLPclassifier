Traditional stalking is a considerable public health issue and
describes a constellation of behaviors in which one individual
intrudes upon or harasses another resulting in fear experi-
enced by the victim as a result of the unwanted pursuit
(McEwan, MacKenzie, Mullen, & James, 2012). Ubiquitous
access to the Internet has dramatically altered communication
in contemporary society, and these electronic means provide
perpetrators with novel ways of pursuing individuals. In light
of this, a phenomenon known as cyberstalking has emerged
that can be defined as the repeated pursuit of an individual
utilizing electronic means to induce fear or distress (Maple,
Short, & Brown, 2011). As the Internet is a rapidly evolving
medium, many new forms of cyberstalking are emerging and
provide additional tools for stalkers' arsenal. Cyberstalking
can take many forms including sending direct threats via
email, encouraging others to threaten or harass the victim,
distributing intimate photographs online, impersonating the
victim online, and seeking and compiling information on the
victim (Short, Linford, Wheatcroft, & Maple, 2014). Social
networking sites provide a novel way to gather information
about an individual and, as such sites facilitate intrusion-like
behaviors, they are being used as conduits for stalking and
online harassment (Fox, 2016). Indeed, according to Kraft
and Wang (2010), social media has made stalking much eas-
ier and visiting social networking sites can lead to an increased
likelihood of becoming a victim of cyberstalking. However,
in many cases, the perpetrator makes use of both online and
offline stalking techniques (Maple et al., 2011; Sheridan &
Grant, 2007) and other researchers have also reported that it is
common for cyberstalking to begin with the issuing of threats,
andescalatetophysicalassault(Bocij,Griffiths,&McFarlane,
2002).
Stalking is one of the most common forms of interper-
sonal violence. Figures from the British Crime Survey 2011
demonstrate that one in five women and one in 10 men will
be stalked at some point during their life (Smith, Coleman,
Eder, & Hall, 2011) and more recent figures from the
2013/2014 Crime Survey for England and Wales
demonstrate that 4.4% of women and 2.5% of men aged 16

Victims' Voices: Understanding the
Emotional Impact of Cyberstalking
and Individuals' Coping Responses
Joanne D. Worsley1, Jacqueline M. Wheatcroft1, Emma Short2,
and Rhiannon Corcoran1
Abstract
Recent quantitative research has identified similar detrimental effects on victims of cyberstalking as those that arise from
traditional stalking. The current study thematically analyzed one hundred victim narratives gathered by means of an online
survey with a view to assessing the mental health and well-being implications of the experience of cyberstalking. Coping
strategies employed by victims and the perceived effectiveness of each strategy were also explored. The findings suggest that
the emotional impact of cyberstalking predominantly includes comorbid anxiety and depression. Common coping strategies
adopted by victims in our sample include avoidant coping, ignoring the perpetrator, confrontational coping, support seeking,
and cognitive reframing. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the ramifications of cyberstalking are widespread,
affecting psychological, social, interpersonal, and economic aspects of life. To adapt, some victims made major changes to both
their work and social life, with some ceasing employment and others modifying their usual daily activities. The widespread
negative effects of cyberstalking identified in this study highlight that this phenomenon should be a concern to both legal and
mental health professionals, particularly as the comments made by our sample illustrate the current inadequacy of response
and provision. Recommendations are discussed and provided for law enforcement and mental health professionals.

2 SAGE Open
to 59 reported experiencing stalking over a period of 1 year
(Office for National Statistics, 2015). Using data from a sup-
plement to the 2006 National Crime Victimisation Survey
(NCVS), Baum, Catalano, Rand, and Rose (2009) reported
that during a 12-month period, 1.4% of adults in the United
States were victims of stalking, and cyberstalking behavior
was reported in one in four stalking cases (26.1%). Taken
together, the characteristics of both online and offline vari-
ants of stalking consist of repeated nuisance behaviors that
are intrusive and that result in negative impacts in the victim
(Shimizu, 2013).
A burgeoning literature reports the negative impacts of
traditional stalking in terms of victims' mental health and
well-being (Blaauw, Winkel, Arensman, Sheridan, & Freeve,
2002; Brewster, 1997; Kuehner, Gass, & Dressing, 2007;
Pathé & Mullen, 1997). Lifestyle changes also appear to be a
universal response to being stalked offline with a diverse
array of responses reported by victims. For instance, some
victims changed workplace or school. Others relocated resi-
dence and many victims eschewed social outlets in favor of
staying at home through fear of encountering their stalker
(Pathé & Mullen, 1997). With regard to the emotional impact
of traditional stalking, Pathé and Mullen (1997) found that
victims' mental health deteriorated after the onset of harass-
ment. More specifically, victims reported heightened anxiety
levels, vivid flashbacks of their stalking ordeal, and persis-
tent nausea. Purcell, Pathé, and Mullen (2005) reported that
stalking victims had elevated levels of general psychological
symptoms compared with short-lived harassment victims
and controls, and almost one in five victims reported post-
traumatic stress symptomology. Similarly, Kamphuis and
Emmelkamp (2001) also documented that many victims
experienced clinical or subclinical manifestations of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a consequence of their
stalking ordeal. In addition, Kuehner et al. (2007) found
associations between stalking victimization and specific
mental health problems, classified according to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
ed., DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) with
the most prevalent mental health problems being major
depression and panic disorder. Collectively, such studies
highlight that traditional stalking poses a serious threat to the
mental health of victims. One factor shown to play an impor-
tant role in the relationship between interpersonal stressors
and psychological difficulties is coping (Lazarus, 1998).
Coping refers to the cognitive and behavioral efforts a
person utilizes to manage stress (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984). Various conceptualizations of coping are reported
in the psychological literature, and many are underpinned
by Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory which dichoto-
mizes coping into problem-focused strategies (e.g., engag-
ing in behavior to change the situation such as seeking
professional support) and emotion-focused strategies (e.g.,
trying to avoid the source of stress). Victims of traditional
stalking employ a wide array of coping strategies to deter
perpetrators and manage the negative emotional impact of
the unwanted pursuit. Cupach and Spitzberg (2004) and
Spitzberg (2002) developed a typology of common coping
strategies employed by stalking victims. Coping strategies
are conceptualized into the following five categories: mov-
ing inward, moving outward, moving away, moving
toward, and moving against (Cupach & Spitzberg, 2004).
The moving inward category reflects the victim using idio-
syncratic problem-solving skills, discounting help from
others, ignoring the problem, and blaming the self. In
direct contrast, the moving outward category reflects the
victim seeking guidance and support from others and this
includes both formal support from law enforcement as well
as social support from family and friends. Moving away
coping strategies aim to avoid and limit access from the
perpetrator, and specific behaviors include restricting
accessibility and relocating. Last, both moving toward and
moving against coping strategies involve attempts to rea-
son with the perpetrator. However, moving against coping
strategies include issuing verbal threats and using physical
violence to deter perpetrators. More recent studies (e.g.,
Geistman, Smith, Lambert, & Cluse-Tolar, 2013; Johansen
& Tjørnhøj-Thomsen, 2016) have categorized victims'
coping responses as either formal responses (i.e., contact-
ing law enforcement) versus informal responses (i.e., deal-
ing with the perpetrator on their own or with the help of
significant others) or external strategies (i.e., seeking
assistance from external resources such as law enforce-
ment and/or family and friends) versus internal strategies
(i.e., changing everyday routines and employing "safety"
behaviors).
Moving to the cyberstalking literature, it is interesting to
note that the majority of this literature is quantitative. Using
data from the 2006 NCVS to compare traditional stalking
and cyberstalking victims, Nobles, Reyns, Fox, and Fisher
(2014) reported that individuals stalked via electronic means
employed more self-protective behaviors, such as changing
usual activities and changing email addresses, in comparison
with traditional stalking victims. The authors offered an
explanation for their findings couched in the dynamics of
online interaction as they suggested that communication via
electronic means is just as personal as, or more personal
than, face-to-face communication and therefore cyberstalk-
ing may elicit a personal violation, which consequently elic-
its more diverse self-protective behaviors. Alternatively,
given the pervasive and public nature of social media, stalk-
ing occurring via these means may influence victims' behav-
iors as humiliating content is visible to a larger audience and,
as it is challenging to completely remove content from the
Internet, it cannot be easily overlooked. In light of this,
cyberstalking may be more detrimental to victims'emotional
health and reputation, and consequently, victims may employ
additional self-protective behaviors.
Despite this difference, previous research has revealed a
general picture of similarity between traditional stalking
Worsley et al. 3
victims and those stalked via electronic means with regard to
the victims' general responses to the ordeal. Specifically,
Sheridan and Grant (2007) reported that the extent of physi-
cal and emotional consequences did not differ significantly
according to the degree of cyberinvolvement. With regard to
social consequences, the only difference was that traditional
stalking was associated more with changes to the victim's
employment status and social routines whereas cyberstalking
was more strongly associated with loss of significant rela-
tionships. More recently, using standardized measures of
anxiety and PTSD, Short, Guppy, Hart, and Barnes (2015)
reported that both traditional stalking and cyberstalking vic-
tims experience comparable elevated levels of psychological
distress as a consequence of the ordeal. In line with this,
when Dreßing, Bailer, Anders, Wagner, and Gallas (2014)
presented users of a German social networking site with a list
of psychosomatic and psychosocial symptoms, over half of
the individuals who had experienced cyberstalking reported
anger, helplessness, and anxiety. They also found that vic-
tims of cyberstalking scored significantly lower on a stan-
dardized measure of well-being than a comparison group
who had not experienced cyberstalking. Thus, there were
still significant negative outcomes for victims despite these
interactions taking place online.
Given the limited existing cyberstalking research is
largely quantitative, the perspectives of victims themselves
are currently underrepresented in this literature. Experiential
data can provide valuable insights about the impact of
cyberstalking, the coping strategies employed by victims,
and the experience of responses and provisions from rele-
vant professional bodies during and following the ordeal. In
light of this, the current research aims to qualitatively exam-
ine the narratives of victims, specifically with regard to the
mental health and well-being consequences of cyberstalking
as well as the coping strategies used to manage the ordeal
effectively. As far as the authors are aware, no research has
examined these issues in this context to date. Furthermore,
victims' experiences of professional involvement, particu-
larly law enforcement, during and following the cyberstalk-
ing ordeal are explored.
Method
Participants
Data from a self-identified sample of 100 anonymous par-
ticipants who defined themselves as victims of cyberstalking
were gathered by an online survey. The sample comprised 65
females and 34 males (one participant's gender was unspeci-
fied) who were aged between 15 and 68 years (M = 38.93,
SD = ±11.42) and the majority of participants were from the
United Kingdom. This sample of 100 victims was obtained
as a random sample from the Electronic Communication
Harassment Observation (ECHO) project and represented
28.33% of the total sample from the wider project (n = 353).
In half of all cases, there had been little or no prior relation-
ship between the stalker and the victim with 25.53% of cases
reporting that the stalker was an acquaintance and 24.47% of
cases reporting that the stalker was a stranger. Other relation-
ships between the stalker and victim included someone dated
casually (13.83%), lived with/was married to/have children
with (11.70%), unknown (9.57%), work colleague (6.38%),
close friend (4.26%), partners "ex" (2.13%), pupil (1.06%),
and relative (1.06%). Ethical approval was obtained from the
University's Ethics Committee. All participants were pro-
vided with information prior to taking part and provided
informed consent on that basis. All participants were assured
of their anonymity. No incentives were provided for
participation.
The Online Survey
The online survey was launched by the National Centre for
Cyberstalking Research (NCCR) and hosted on the website
of the British Charity Network for Surviving Stalking (NSS).
Participants were invited through a NSS newsletter, national
broadcasts, and print media in news stories related to cyber-
stalking. The questions were developed iteratively by profes-
sionals and researchers. There was an inbuilt check for the
kind of experiences that people were reporting in the form of
a definition: "cyberstalking is a course of action that involves
more than one incident perpetrated through or utilizing elec-
tronic means (such as the Internet or mobile technology) that
causes distress, fear, or alarm. Have you experienced cyber-
stalking which meets this definition?"
The online survey was designed to capture information
about the experiences of cyberstalking and, importantly, it
did not explicitly address the effects of the experience on the
victims. The survey participants, all victims of cyberstalking,
were asked to respond to the following broad open-ended
questions: (a) How did it all begin? When did you realize it
was becoming a problem? (b) Give examples of each of the
harassment behaviors experienced. (c) Did any actions
improve the situation? (d) Did any actions make the situation
worse? (e) Are there any actions that you feel would have
protected you better if they had been available to you? (f)
What else could have helped improve the situation?
Method of Analysis
Survey responses were analyzed using the thematic analysis
procedure described by Braun and Clarke (2006). Thematic
analysis is a flexible qualitative methodology that aims to
identify, analyze, and report recurrent themes in data (Braun
& Clarke, 2006). This analysis takes a realist epistemological
standpoint, treating participants' narratives as representative
of their lived "reality". Thematic analysis was selected for
several reasons: First, the narratives may be varied, specifi-
cally with regard to individual experience, and therefore may
not yield a single overarching theory. Second, as no prior
4 SAGE Open
qualitative research had been conducted specifically assess-
ing the mental health and well-being implications of cyber-
stalking, this methodology was considered most useful for
providing an initial description of the consequences of cyber-
stalking and last, thematic analysis is sensitive to individual
nuance. However, as this analysis does not attempt to
describe the content of the entire dataset, the analysis could
be described as more theoretical than inductive as the coding
process was driven by our analytical interest in the mental
health and well-being consequences of cyberstalking rather
than to provide an overall description of the dataset.
The steps for conducting thematic analysis as outlined in
detail by Braun and Clarke (2006) were followed: First, the
data were read carefully to identify meaningful units of text
relevant to the research topic and initial codes were gener-
ated. The codes dealing with the same issue were then
grouped together to generate the thematic structures. The
analysis was conducted across all the aforementioned ques-
tions, rather than for each question independently to identify
themes across the data as a whole. The themes, drawn purely
from within the data, are illustrated by anonymous direct
quotations. As the data were supplied from the NCCR and
provided online, there are no line numbers present to report.
However, to illustrate the breadth of participant contribution
to the study, we have included the participant number beside
each quotation.
Analysis
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described health
as " . . . a state of complete physical, mental and social well-
being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"
(WHO, 1946, p. 1315). In light of this, cyberstalking could
influence health in a number of ways, and the ramifications of
this ordeal are therefore potentially multilayered with serious
potential outcomes. Using the method of analysis described
above, the participants' descriptions of the emotional, cogni-
tive, and lifestyle impact of cyberstalking were explored. The
emergent themes and associated subordinate themes, summa-
rized in Table 1, illustrate the number of ways that cyberstalk-
ing can influence health and are each discussed in turn.
Fear
In line with the definition of cyberstalking, a preponderance of
victims experience a heightened sense of fear as a conse-
quence of the cyberstalking ordeal, and fear as an intense emo-
tion may overshadow every other aspect of life, for instance:
My whole life stopped because I was in so much fear. (Participant
19)
In the end I became phobic. (Participant 92)
There are about 6 people who write things about me and to me
that make me fearful. (Participant 9)
Also, it seemed that victims found it difficult to determine
which self-protective strategy to adopt in response to their
fear:
When under fear, in panick [sic] it is difficult to work out what
is the best solution. (Participant 54)
Thus fear was a consequence of the repeated pursuit felt by
the victims and it is possible that victims develop anxiety as
a consequence of the fear response and the helpless position
they find themselves in to relieve this fear.
Anxiety
It appeared that anxiety could manifest as a posttraumatic
stress response or as acute physiologically based responses
such as panic attacks. Some participants reported experiencing
intense, disabling anxiety which can be linked specifically to
the cyberstalking ordeal. When anxiety is tied to such a trau-
matic event, it is sometimes accompanied by flashbacks:
I still have flashbacks and experience anxiety when going into
my inbox. (Participant 81)
To this day I still have flashbacks when sat in my front room.
(Participant 99)
Taken together, such quotations serve to highlight that vivid
memories of the cyberstalking ordeal are relived involun-
tarily and ultimately this can have a severe emotional impact.
In addition to vivid flashbacks, intrusive recollections were
also reported:
I imagine I see his face in every car that passes. (Participant 2)
Collectively, intrusive recollections and vivid flashbacks are
commonly reported symptoms of PTSD. Although some par-
ticipants reported posttraumatic stress symptomology, others
overtly stated that they have suffered PTSD as a consequence
of the traumatic ordeal:

I became very ill in August 2009 and now suffer complex
PTSD/depression as a result of the harassment and abuse.
(Participant 99)
Taken together, many victims reported suffering from
clinical or subclinical manifestations of PTSD. In addition
to distressing recollections and flashbacks, other partici-
pants described distress in the form of paranoia and
mistrust:
I get paranoyed [sic] very easily and reluctant to trust indirect
communications. (Participant 54)
I found myself being suspicious of friends and customers who I
had known well for years. (Participant 63)
Moreover, some participants described that the various
states of anxiety exemplified above may also take the form
of panic attacks:
I had panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. (Participant 68)
I still have anxiety attacks when the phone rings. (Participant 67)
Thus, as a consequence of the cyberstalking ordeal, some
participants experienced intense periods of overwhelming
anxiety alongside pronounced physiological effects.
Persistent nausea was reported by one participant who
experienced the urge to vomit every time she addressed her
incoming mail:
I began to fall apart and would be sick when I had to address
incoming email. (Participant 93)
In line with this, heightened anxiety levels manifested as
"shakes" in another participant:
Her last email left me shaking. (Participant 72)
In addition, some participants also experienced persistent/
chronic anxiety which manifested in the form of constant
hypervigilance:
I am constantly looking around my shoulder when leaving
school. (Participant 1)
The stress and fear of having to look over your shoulder all the
time. (Participant 64)
The emotional impact of cyberstalking could be long-lasting
as some participants still experienced anxiety when access-
ing emails or hearing the phone ringing:
I still experience anxiety when going to my inbox. My health
has not been the same since. (Participant 81)
I still have anxiety attacks when the phone rings. (Participant 67)
Depressive Symptoms
Reflecting the fact that anxiety and depression very com-
monly occur together, profound anxiety was often reported
alongside depressive symptoms. For instance, one partici-
pant stated she now suffers:
Complex PTSD/depression as a result of the harassment and
abuse. (Participant 92)
Depression encompasses a wide array of symptoms includ-
ing loss of control, low mood, rumination, and feelings of
helplessness and hopelessness. Some participants expressed
a lack of control over the situation:
You are made to feel with less control of your life. (Participant 54)
I realised then I had lost all control of the situation. A low point.
(Participant 14)
Taken together, such cognitions may contribute to the low
mood experienced by victims. For others, low mood was
triggered by the stalker's specific tactic:
Her two replies accusing me of all sorts of things I hadn't ever
done made me feel pretty low. (Participant 3)
Low mood is accompanied by negative automatic cogni-
tions, which consequently lead to the emotional elements of
depression. In line with this, rumination also arises among
victims as one participant stated:
Thewholesituationoccupiedmythoughtsconstantly.(Participant
63)
In addition, feelings of helplessness were prominent
amongst victims, for instance,
Impotence at how little I can do is the main emotion I fee(l).
(Participant 55)
I was helpless to defend myself. (Participant 19)
I was also made to feel helpless about the situation. (Participant 64)
Similarly, participants also expressed pessimistic views of
the future, such as,
I feel it is something I will never entirely escape. (Participant 53)
He will follow me for the rest of my life and I can do nothing.
(Participant 2)
I realised it was a problem fairly early on, but there was nothing
I could do about it. (Participant 95)
Thus participants felt unable to change the situation; how-
ever, by remaining passive, victims may exacerbate their
6 SAGE Open
depressive symptoms. Taken together, the cyberstalking
ordeal leaves victims with a low opinion of the control they
have over their own lives and thus, with a pessimistic future
outlook.
Secondary Emotional Responses
In addition to the primary emotional consequences detailed
above, it appears as though once the acute fear abates, anger
or annoyance at the situation is expressed. For instance,
I stopped getting afraid quite some time ago, now I'm more
annoyed. (Participant 14)
Despite resolving this amicably four weeks or so ago, there's
still an element of trauma for want of a better term, and I still
have a reasonably short fuse. (Participant 42)
One participant entertained aggressive thoughts and claimed
that she wanted to physically assault her stalker:
Punching him in the face! I know that sounds stupid but it made
me so angry and upset. (Participant 21)
In addition to anger and annoyance, other participants felt
embarrassed by the situation and such negative self-directed
affect may serve to deter victims from seeking help, for instance:
I probably should have entered counselling earlier although I
felt too ashamed. (Participant 98)
Embarrassment has made me reluctant to involve the police.
(Participant 44)
Global Well-Being Consequences
In addition to specific forms of distress and emotion, some
participants acknowledged the breadth of potential well-
being consequences of cyberstalking as for some the impact
was all-encompassing:
On the whole this stalker has had a huge affect on my life and
mental stability. (Participant 63)
When I look back I think I was an emotional wreck who didn't
know which way to turn. (Participant 63)
I nearly had a breakdown and I am a psychotherapist. (Participant
99)
It was the worst experience of my life. (Participant 80)
The breadth of potential consequences were also
highlighted:
I had a friend who killed himself over the EXACT SAME
incidents that I experienced, but he did not leave facebook, and
therefore took his own life. (Participant 27)
I am no child, but if this was a child, I could see them driven to
suicide because of this kind of bullying. (Participant 61)
Victims also reported that the cyberstalking ordeal
affected social, interpersonal, and economic aspects of their
lives. More specifically, the profound states of chronic anxi-
ety and low mood evidenced above negatively influenced
victims' working lives and impaired their relationships with
significant others. Job losses can have damaging effects on
individuals' well-being and many participants were required
to withdraw from their job:
My only response was to withdraw from the public eye almost
entirely--pulling out of several high profile jobs. (Participant 53)
Proving that they can hear my conversations and read my emails
and files in a deliberate attempt to intimidate me and "still" me
into inactivity which has affected my work and lost me jobs.
(Participant 90)
I now have NO email what so ever so makes it hard for me to
apply for jobs online. (Participant 17)
In addition to withdrawing from jobs, other victims termi-
nated their use of particular websites, for instance,
I am deaf, and have to leave this site and the many freonds [sic]
I have made as it provokes this man. (Participant 9)
Hence some victims lost contact with their online friends as
a consequence of curtailing their Internet use, and this may
induce feelings of isolation. Similarly, many victims
reported that the cyberstalking ordeal placed an undue
amount of strain on their relationships with significant oth-
ers. For instance,
She turned a lot of my friends against me and destroyed one
good friendship for several years. (Participant 77)
The resulting consequence is that my husband and I had to cut
his family out of our lives for good as it is too painful a reminder
of the trauma we went through. (Participant 6)
Taken together, the loss of such significant relationships as a
consequence of the ordeal may negatively affect victims'
well-being.
Lack of Effective Victim Support
In light of such negative consequences, it is not surprising
that victims seek professional help. However, the majority
of participants expressed strong dissatisfaction with the
lack of support they received in relation to the cyberstalk-
ing ordeal. Most victims reported that they were not taken
seriously by law enforcement and, in light of this, many
victims suggested that an increased awareness of the seri-
ous nature of this phenomenon among police officers is
warranted:
Worsley et al. 7
The police didn't take this seriously enough and I felt really
stupid and humiliated. (Participant 19)
It was such a struggle to get the police to take it seriously and
convince them it was more than just a few words on websites/
emails, texts etc. (Participant 20)
Some police officers even found the situation comical during the
years. (Participant 56)
I think law enforcement people should be taking cyber harassment
more seriously than they are at the moment. It is not just children
and teenagers who are affected by it but also adults and so more
attention needs to be given to this issue. (Participant 16)
Apreponderance of victims reported that they did not receive
any support at all and some victims expressed dissatisfaction
with the continuity of support. For instance,
I was left on my own with no support. (Participant 19)
The police never referred me to any support organisations.
(Participant 15)
I had little continuity from the police which meant that I was
often re-telling all the information to different officers.
(Participant 15)
More support from the police would have been really helpful.
(Participant 99)
In light of this, participants highlighted that law enforcement
personnel should signpost victims to antistalking
organizations:
It would have been better if I had received more proactive advice
such as putting me onto an anti-stalking organisation, and
empowering me to enable me to deal with it. (Participant 64)
If the police don't have time, they could give the victim the
contact details of an anti-stalking organisation. (Participant 63)
In addition, it appeared as though the police did not take
action if the victim's physical health was not in jeopardy:
Without physical attack, they seem unwilling to do much.
(Participant 74)
As long as you are not physically injured, the police do not act.
(Participant 44)
In line with this, one participant suggested that law enforcers
should be made aware of the extent of psychological damage
sustained by victims of cyberstalking:
Police should be made aware of the distress that the victim is put
under. Some sort of leaflet would be very useful of best actions
to take i.e. do not reply, gather evidence etc. (Participant 59)
More worryingly, some participants believe that the way
they were dealt with by professionals directly contributed to
escalation of negative impact. For instance,
I do not believe that I would have become ill if the Police had
taken effective action at a much earlier stage to protect myself
and my children. (Participant 92)
Similarly, in other cases, law enforcers exacerbated the vic-
tim's feelings of helplessness:
Reporting him (police, website/service providers) made the
situation worse too, because it did nothing and therefore I felt more
helpless, and like the system was on his side. (Participant 24)
The police did take me seriously but I was also made to feel
helpless about the situation. (Participant 64)
Such negative experiences with law enforcement may add
to victims' feelings of vulnerability. Thus, victims may
feel further disempowered by this apparent lack of effec-
tive support and as a consequence of reporting the ordeal
to police without an effective response, they may feel,
paradoxically, that the cyberstalker is empowered. Last,
some victims were made to feel as though they were at
fault:
The police made us feel like we were almost to blame.
(Participant 20)
They said it was my fault for putting the information online in
teh [sic] first place. (Participant 92)
In addition to the lack of support provided by law enforce-
ment personnel, many participants also expressed strong dis-
satisfaction with the lack of support they received from other
expected sources of help. With regard to social networking
sites, a preponderance of victims reported that they did not
receive any response from Facebook after they reported the
ordeal. For instance,
There was no reponse [sic] from hotmail or facebook in regards
to the breach of security--which totally appalled me that they
continued to allow this woman to impersonate and abuse me
online. (Participant 6)
More worryingly, some participants believed that as they
were not offered any form of protection or help from expected
sources, this contributed to the escalation of negative impact:
The university did not do anything to protect me, and I feel that
a system that was less lenient would have spared me a lot of
distress and psychological abuse. I was given no support
throughout the whole thing. (Participant 68)
Even health professional friends washed their hands of me and
so in that sense, colluded in the abuse of me. (Participant 77)
8 SAGE Open
Having more friends on my side would have given me strength
to take steps to stop things much earlier--and probably before it
got so out of hand that I had panic attacks and nervous
breakdowns. (Participant 68)
In line with this, many victims suggested that increasing gen-
eral awareness is vital in combating cyberstalking and the
negative emotional consequences. When victims were asked
what could have improved the situation, many victims
acknowledged the urgent need for increased public aware-
ness, for instance:
People having a better understanding of cyberstalking. My
friends, family and employers all reacted very strongly and
judged me. (Participant 96)
If my friends had known a little more about what harassment
and stalking is, they wouldn't have brushed him off as harmless
as long as they did (some of them still do) and refuse to believe
that he was a problem for me. (Participant 68)
Even the friends and family who really understand my whole
long story still feel obliged to talk to the harasser in social
situations leaving me feeling extremely angry that they belittle
my experience. (Participant 62)
Coping
Given the negative impact of cyberstalking outlined above,
the specific ways that victims reported coping with cyber-
stalking were also explored. Coping responses can be seen as
attempts to respond to an interpersonal stressor and the emer-
gent themes were organized into restrictive behavioral
approaches (e.g., avoiding and ignoring the perpetrator) and
nonrestrictive approaches (e.g., confrontational coping, sup-
port seeking, and cognitive reframing). These approaches
encompass the different coping strategies drawn on by vic-
tims to deal with the situation.
Restrictive behavioral approaches predominately include
both avoiding and/or ignoring the perpetrator. For instance,
most victims modified their usual daily activities through
fear of encountering the perpetrator:
I stopped answering all phone calls. I also stopped looking out
my window when being attracted to do so. (Participant 74)
I had to modify my day-to-day schedule so I wouldn't see him.
(Participant 69)
I also avoided places where I knew he would normally be.
(Participant 50)
Similarly, many victims restricted their social media activity
to avoid coming into contact with the perpetrator online.
Specifically, many victims avoided particular webpages, and
changed both their email address and/or privacy settings on
social networking sites to limit the perpetrator's access:
I don't go on social networking sites anymore or even own a
mobile phone. (Participant 20)
I left the forum and all my blog/other social networking have
privacy settings to friends only. (Participant 21)
I changed my email address after a couple of months. (Participant
59)
Therefore, many participants used some form of avoidant
coping for short-term relief and although this coping strategy
does not appear to improve victims' quality of life, it appears
to be effective as, in most cases, it successfully terminated
unwanted intrusions:
I quit the internet totally and that pretty much blocked off his
communications with me. (Participant 50)
When I stopped using social networking sites, I did not have to
be subjected to the abuse that I received on them. (Participant 27)
By adopting this coping strategy, victims appear to be proac-
tively trying to protect themselves and this coping strategy
successfully made individuals less accessible to the perpetra-
tor. However, one participant expressed resistance to adopt-
ing this coping strategy as, by avoiding particular social
media platforms, the victim felt paradoxically that the cyber-
stalker was given more control:
When I approached an anti-stalking organisation about it, they
replied and suggested I stop using the forums, stop my blog or
use a different name. I already did that once, and as far as I can
see, that's making me act like a victim and playing right into a
stalker's hands. I would prefer it if I was the one empowered,
rather than the stalker. (Participant 3)
In contrast, other victims took control of the situation by
ignoring the perpetrator, for instance:
I ignored the problems which was quite difficult. (Participant
30)
For some victims, adopting this coping strategy also
appeared to effectively deal with the unwanted intrusions:
Ignoring him was probably the best response as any response
from me appeared to either inflame him or make him happy.
(Participant 64)
The only thing that helped was refusing to communicate with
him at all. (Participant 67)
Ignoring and not reacting if possible, is quite effective.
(Participant 54)
In contrast to taking control by ignoring the perpetrator,
other participants took a more agentic stance by directly
Worsley et al. 9
confronting the perpetrator. By adopting this coping strategy,
victims appeared to be addressing the command imbalance
by attempting to regain power, for instance:
I told them to leave me alone. The e-mails stopped but stalking
online didn't. (Participant 19)
However, this coping strategy may be psychologically
rewarding for the perpetrator and thus, in some cases directly
communicating with the perpetrator inflamed the situation,
for instance:
Responding did not help. He just learned that the price for
talking to me was calling 30+ times in a row. (Participant 67)
Confronting her via email just made her send more abusive
emails. (Participant 76)
Any attempt to tell her to stop just makes it worse. She ramps it
up even more. (Participant 7)
Moreover, for other victims, an authoritative figure
directly contacted the perpetrator. It appears as though when
perpetrators are addressed by a figure of authority, this may
reduce the victim's vulnerability in the perpetrator's mind as
adopting this coping strategy appeared to culminate in desis-
tance, for instance:
When the police finally took action and issued a harassment
order things seemed to improve. (Participant 100)
I contacted the head of my college department, as my harasser
was in the same major as me, and he interceded. After that the
harassment stopped. (Participant 75)
Social support seeking was also evident and primarily
included disclosing the situation to friends and family
members:
I contacted friends and circulated messages which had been sent
privately. They then provided a barrier between myself and the
individual. (Participant 22)
By sharing the abuse with a close circle of friends/relatives and
dealing with it in journalistic terms, at no time have I become
paranoid, despite much anxiety suffered. (Participant 85)
My father wrote him a priority letter threatening him that if he
did not desist we would get the police involved. (Participant 69)
However, indirectly communicating with the perpetrator
may in some cases inflame the situation, for instance:
Allowing a friend to respond on my behalf inflamed the
situation. (Participant 48)
Although for others, this coping strategy was effective:
It only improved after my father rang him to ask him to stop.
(Participant 25)
Last, a preponderance of victims adopted a coping strat-
egy known as cognitive reframing. These participants
attempted to reframe the meaning of their experiences and
tried to understand the perpetrator's behavior by basing it in
a framework, for instance:
Even after everything she has done, I don't hate her. I just want
her to get some treatment and leave me alone. (Participant 7)
She needs mental health support. I was scared but understand
she needs care. (Participant 19)
Here, victims were trying to find a way to construe the ordeal
as filled with meaning and these participants did not accept
victimhood or blame themselves for the ordeal. Thus, the
ability to cognitively reframe thoughts could enable the rees-
tablishment of some emotional control, laying the course to
a more resilient path. By empathically representing their
stalker as a person in distress and in need of help, a reposi-
tioning of their own responsive behavior and stance was
enabled. Thus, reframing the experience less as a self-
focused emotional ordeal and more in terms of other-focused
emotional understanding changes how the victim experi-
ences and reacts to the ordeal placing it in an understandable
framework while also making it even less about "blaming"
the self. In fact, a preponderance of victims were empathic
toward their stalker, stating that such behavior must emerge
as a result of a mental health difficulty in the perpetrator. For
example,
Worrying emails that obviously came from a mentally ill mind.
(Participant 40)
By this time I was aware that he had multiple addictions and
appeared delusional. (Participant 93)
The extent to which such representations reduced or exacer-
bated fear or anxiety could not be extracted from the data
however.
Discussion
Findings and Implications
The thematic analysis of material voluntarily offered within
an online survey launched by the NCCR has provided
nuanced insights about both the emotional and restrictive
lifestyle consequences of cyberstalking, and the experience
of care from law enforcement and other professional agen-
cies. The current findings suggest that the emotional impact
of cyberstalking predominantly includes comorbid anxiety
and depression. Profound states of chronic anxiety and low
mood negatively influenced victims' working lives and
10 SAGE Open
impaired their relationships with significant others. Victims
employed a wide array of coping strategies to deter perpetra-
tors and manage the negative emotional impact of the
unwanted pursuit. Common coping strategies adopted by
victims included avoidant coping, ignoring the perpetrator,
confrontational coping, support seeking, and cognitive
reframing. Unfortunately, when victims sought help, it seems
that the way they were dealt with by police officers and sig-
nificant others increased, rather than decreased, the negative
impact of the ordeal.
It appears that the psychological consequences of experi-
encing cyberstalking are broadly comparable with those of
traditional stalking, including depressive symptoms, height-
ened anxiety levels, and posttraumatic stress responses
(Kuehner et al., 2007; Pathé & Mullen, 1997; Purcell et al.,
2005). The qualitative findings reported here are also in line
with earlier quantitative cyberstalking research which
showed that over half of victims reported feelings of help-
lessness and anxiety (Dreßing et al., 2014). Further to this,
the coping strategies employed by victims of cyberstalking
are consistent with the typology of common coping strate-
gies offered by Cupach and Spitzberg (2004) as being
employed by victims of traditional stalking. For instance,
confronting the perpetrator and cognitive reframing reflect
"moving toward" coping strategies, avoidant coping reflects
"moving away" coping strategies, ignoring the perpetrator
reflects "moving inward" coping strategies, and seeking sup-
port from external sources reflects "moving outward" coping
strategies.
The relationship between cyberstalking victimization and
emotional distress is likely to be influenced by the resilience
or vulnerabilities of the victims and, as coping strategies
have been linked to psychological functioning, they repre-
sent viable targets for intervention. The ability to cognitively
restructure thoughts may enable resilience as, based on the
comments made by our sample, being able to empathically
represent the stalker as themselves a distressed person and
internally framing their behavior appears to form part of
dealing with the ordeal effectively. However, the reports of
many victims did not indicate that this cognitive coping strat-
egy was adopted, instead they reported modifying their usual
daily activities and restricted their social media activity to
avoid coming into contact with the perpetrator. Although this
coping strategy successfully made victims less accessible to
their stalker, as the Internet has become increasingly impor-
tant in many facets of life, especially communication and
social interaction, there were negative social consequences
associated with avoiding the online milieu, such as social
disconnectedness and job losses. More specifically, restrict-
ing access to social media platforms often separates victims
from positive social connections with friends and family, and
this may subsequently reduce access to social support and
increase feelings of isolation. As coping strategies have the
potential to determine the mental health outcomes experi-
enced by victims, coping responses should represent a key
target for therapeutic intervention, and establishing adaptive,
cognitive coping strategies may be beneficial in helping vic-
tims regain a sense of empowerment and mastery.
Lessons for Law Enforcement Personnel
The current findings also suggest that victims frequently
engage with law enforcement personnel to both gain support
and to provide evidence for investigation. Victims' feedback
about this engagement provides insights for practitioners as
currently the support and protection available to victims of
cyberstalking seems unreliable and inadequate. Most nota-
bly, the victims acknowledged that during the cyberstalking
ordeal, a supportive police officer who understands the com-
plex nature of cyberstalking is required as most victims
reported that the actions of expected sources of help were
ineffectual and often, victims were made to feel as though
they were to blame. It is notable that, unlike preferred prac-
tice in relation to victims of face-to-face harassment, partici-
pants in this survey reported lack of consistency in their
dealings with the police. Given the intense distress experi-
enced in response to cyberstalking, parity of practice is
clearly needed. Instead, victims reported being questioned
by a number of different police officers, and expressed frus-
tration due to this inconsistency. Hence, in future, the num-
ber of officers interacting with the victim should be limited
to enhance consistency and continuity. Finally, in the limited
number of cases where the police did act, the victims were
not kept informed about the progress of the case. Thus, a
further recommendation is that all victims should be informed
as the case progresses according to the protocol. On balance,
it is clear that victims of cyberstalking have to deal with a
number of additional stressors; first as a direct consequence
of the perpetrators' behavior followed by what is viewed as
ineffectual support from law enforcement personnel. To min-
imize the feeling of revictimization, police officers should
demonstrate appropriate empathy as instantiated in best
practice guidance procedures associated with traditional
stalking. To this end, workshops and training courses should
be provided to law enforcers to increase awareness of the
extent of psychological damage sustained by victims and the
importance of treating cyberstalking offenses seriously from
first responder. Overall, the process should culminate in a
referral to suitable support agencies when necessary.
Lessons for Mental Health Professionals
In line with this, given the extent of psychological damage
sustained by victims of cyberstalking, a referral to psycho-
logical therapy should be made available for victims when
necessary as the current findings demonstrate that the experi-
ence prompts negative evaluations about themselves, others,
and/or the world. More specifically, a course of cognitive-
behavioral therapy focusing on the victim's cognitions may
assist in restructuring any morbid perceptions as it is common
Worsley et al. 11
for victims of cyberstalking to become hypervigilant and
develop a view of the world as unsafe, a view of the self as
helpless and to blame, and a view of the future that is hopeless
and pessimistic. Thus, restoring the victim's view of himself
or herself as a worthwhile individual, and correcting general-
ized threat-focused evaluations about the world should be of
principal importance. In addition, therapists should focus not
only on the victim's cognitions but also equally on their
avoidance responses/"safety" behaviors. The current findings
demonstrate that victims frequently avoid external cues asso-
ciated with the ordeal, such as the phone ringing, incoming
mail, certain websites, and places associated with the perpe-
trator to prevent becoming overwhelmed with difficult emo-
tions. However, such avoidant coping or "safety" behaviors
are often counterproductive as although in the short term,
avoidance behaviors will be rewarded by a reduction in dis-
tress; in the long term, such behaviors may exacerbate the
victim's restrictive behaviors and feelings of isolation, which
may lead to detachment. For instance, one participant was
advised by law enforcement personnel to restrict their social
media activity by withdrawing from a particular website;
however, as a consequence, the victim lost contact with his
social connections and may have felt paradoxically, that the
cyberstalker was empowered. Avoidance may respond to
behavioral techniques, which assist victims to gradually
resume abandoned daily activities such as answering the
phone or addressing incoming mail and manage the associ-
ated anxiety. Taken together, interventions should focus on
both restructuring any morbid perceptions and teaching vic-
tims not to adopt habitual avoidant coping strategies or
"safety" behaviors.
Limitations
Despite the practical implications of the current study, there
are several limitations that require consideration when inter-
preting the findings. First, as the survey was disseminated
through online channels, those victims with limited access to
digital technologies may not be represented, particularly as
the current findings demonstrated that it is common for vic-
tims to avoid the Internet as a consequence of their cyber-
stalkingordeal.Second,asthesampleconsistedofindividuals
who were self-identified victims, there is potential for bias in
the responses. Participants may have already been aware of
the NSS as a result of their cyberstalking ordeal. Therefore,
the current sample may be considered unrepresentative of
cyberstalking victims in the general population. The sample
may have recruited those more aware and distressed victims,
whichmayhaveinfluencedthecurrentanalysis.Nevertheless,
these criticisms can in part be balanced against the number of
responders. Equally, it is important to highlight that the
reports of the victims in this particular survey may be an
underestimation of the extent of negative consequences of
cyberstalking. This is because the survey questions did not
explicitly ask participants to reflect on their emotional
responses. As the data were extracted from a series of broad
open-ended questions not tailored specifically toward mental
health and well-being, the analysis is an emerging,
unprompted story and this therefore is considered one of the
key strengths of the current study. Thus, using the open-
ended questions enabled an untainted and potentially more
accurate story to be elicited and adopting this approach also
enabled those critical aspects of mental health and well-
being to emerge.
Future Directions
Based on the sheer number of victims reporting or suspecting
the presence of psychological difficulties in their stalkers,
further research should investigate the link between mental
health difficulties and cyberstalking behavior. Qualitative
data from the perpetrators of this crime would be extremely
effective in ascertaining the nature of cyberstalking and, in
particular, the association between life experiences, mental
health difficulties, and cyberstalking behavior. In line with
this, some victims were empathic toward their stalker by
acknowledging that their perpetrator needs mental health
support. Further research could therefore explore gender dif-
ferences among cyberstalking victims as, in line with the fear
of crime literature (e.g., Warr & Ellison, 2000), female
cyberstalking victims may be more likely to express fear for
themselves whereas male cyberstalking victims may be more
likely to express concern for their stalker. Last, as revenge
porn is becoming increasingly prevalent (Kamal & Newman,
2016), future research should qualitatively examine the nar-
ratives of revenge porn victims, specifically with regard to
the mental health and well-being consequences as well as the
coping strategies used to manage the ordeal effectively. The
authors are currently investigating this issue as to date, this
phenomenon has received very little empirical attention.
Conclusion
To summarize, this study is the first to qualitatively examine
both the negative emotional impact of cyberstalking and
individuals' coping responses. Data analysis indicates the
extent of the psychological and social impairments experi-
enced by victims of cyberstalking behavior and highlights
that this phenomenon should be an immediate concern to
both legal and mental health professionals alike. There is
scope for improvement in how victims are dealt with and
increasing general awareness is vital. It is noteworthy that
the stalking threat does not have to be physical to cause psy-
chological damage, and in this, the findings appear to con-
solidate previous results of quantitative studies of
cyberstalking, such as those presented by Dreßing et al.
(2014). The relationship between cyberstalking victimiza-
tion and emotional distress is likely to be influenced by the
resilience or vulnerabilities of the victims and, as coping
strategies have been linked to psychological functioning,
12 SAGE Open
they represent viable targets for intervention. Specifically,
the ability to cognitively restructure thoughts may enable
resilience as being able to empathically represent the stalker
as themselves a distressed person appears to form part of
dealing with the ordeal effectively. However, many victims
frequently engaged in avoidance/"safety" behaviors in
attempt to both avoid feelings of distress regarding their vic-
timization and avoid coming into contact with the perpetra-
tor. Consequently, interventions should focus on getting
victims to not habitually rely on avoidant coping strategies
in addition to restructuring any morbid perceptions.
Intervening before avoidance or "safety" behaviors become
ingrained and fostering adaptive cognitive coping strategies
may enable victims to regain a sense of empowerment. In
sum, as technology continues to develop, cyberstalking
rates will continue to rise, therefore, a more coherent
approach to understanding and addressing this nuisance
behavior is necessary to prevent cyberstalking from occur-
ring and also to mitigate the effects after such cybervictim-
ization has occurred.
