Trends in marital dissolution by women's education
in the United States
Steven P. Martin 1
Abstract
I use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (N = 16,756) to measure trends
in marital dissolution rates for U.S. women by education level. In marriage cohorts
from the mid-1970s to the 1990s, marital dissolution rates fell among women with a 4-
year college degree or more, but remained high among women with less than a 4-year
college degree. This diverging trend began in the mid-1970s and is not explained by
recent increases in women's overall educational attainment, nor by recent increases in
age at marriage timing and premarital childbearing. These results suggest a growing
association between socioeconomic disadvantage and family instability.

1. Introduction
Class differences in marital dissolution rates are a cause for concern in a time of rising
economic inequality. White and Rogers (2000) noted that both gendered and gender-
neutral theories of marital dissolution predict that as economic inequality increases, so
should the class gap in marital dissolution rates. Regardless of their origin, however,
growing class differences in marital dissolution rates would exacerbate some effects of
socioeconomic inequality and perpetuate inequality across generations, to the extent
that marital dissolutions contribute to deficits in adult outcomes as well as deficits in
children's physical and emotional health, educational attainment and performance
(Amato 2000; Hetherington and Stanley-Hagan 1997; McLanahan and Bumpass 1988).
Whereas a slight decline in marital dissolution rates since the late 1970s (Goldstein
1999; Schoen and Standish 2001) is good news, this good news is tempered if the
overall trend reflects a sharp decline to highly educated women exclusively, rather than
a broad decline among all groups of women.
Results from several recent studies suggest a divergence in marital dissolution
rates by women's educational attainment. Raley and Bumpass (2003) examined first
marriage dissolution rates and union dissolution rates for women in the 1995 National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). They found an education-by-trend interaction
consistent with an educational divergence, although the interaction was statistically
significant for only two of several comparisons across educational groups, at p<.10.
Sweeney and Phillips (2004) found a similar pattern using the June 1985, 1990, and
1995 Current Population Surveys, as did Martin and Bumpass (1989) using earlier
versions of the NSFG, but neither study tested education-by-trend interactions for
statistical significance. Elwood and Jencks (2004) also found educational divergence in
the prevalence of divorced or separated mothers as a percent of all mothers in the 2000
Census 1% Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS). Of course, trends in divorced or
separated mothers as a percent of all mothers reflect demographic trends in marriage,
remarriage, and childbearing as well as trends in marital dissolution.
Whereas the above studies have produced consistent findings, there are still
reasons to be uncertain about the extent and timing of any educational divergence in
marital dissolution rates. For one thing, even in simple descriptive statistics, the way
that education is measured can distort and exaggerate trends in marital dissolution in
ways that previous studies have addressed only lightly or not at all. In addition, at least
two other studies of trends in marital dissolution reported no evidence for educational
divergence, at least in the full statistical models (Teachman 2002, South 2001). These
studies differ from the others in several respects; they use data sets with generally
smaller sample sizes but more statistical controls and a longer historical time span, and
they use different specifications for educational attainment and age at marriage. This
Demographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20
http://www.demographic-research.org 539
paper attempts to reduce the uncertainty that still exists about trends in marital
dissolution by women's education by examining whether educational divergence is
truly occurring, and if so, how much is occurring, and when the divergence began. I
outline three objectives below:
2. Research objectives
2.1 Objective one: Confirm an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates
An observed trend of declining marital dissolution rates for highly educated women and
stable or rising rates for less educated women could be (at least in part) a spurious result
of the way education is measured. Elwood and Jencks (2004) and others have noted
that shifts in marital dissolution rates at a given education level might simply reflect
changes in the educational distribution rather than changes in the relationship between
education and marital dissolution. One way to correct for this problem is to assign
percentile ranks to education categories, and then to derive approximate quantiles for
the education. An example would be to measure marital dissolution rates for the top
third, middle third, and bottom third of the education distribution. However, Ellwood
and Jencks also noted that each education level should be affected in the same direction,
so that shifts in educational attainment should have little effect on the coefficients for
differences between education categories (see Ellwood and Jencks 2004). In this
paper, I focus on the increasing differences between educational categories rather than
the trend for each separate category.
A potentially greater but less recognized problem with the measurement of
education is that studies of trends in marital dissolution have typically measured
educational attainment at only one point in time, usually at the time of the survey
interview. A woman's educational attainment at interview could have been completed
before marriage, at some point during a marriage, or even after a marital dissolution. At
the very least, this means that for some women, their education at interview does not
correspond to their education level for part or all of the time they were married. This
problem with educational measurement will almost certainly distort trend estimates in
retrospective surveys, because women in earlier marriage cohorts have more years to
complete their education after marriage, and even after a marital dissolution, but before
the survey interview. A reported decline in marital dissolution rates for recent cohorts
of highly educated women could simply reflect a correlation between marriage cohort
and the average time between marriage and survey interview. The current analysis
addresses this problem by recording a woman's marital and educational histories, and
coding educational attainment as a time-varying covariate.
Martin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States
540 http://www.demographic-research.org
A final concern is that evidence for divergence in marital dissolution rates might
show up in some data sets but not in others. In the appendix, I summarize trends in
marital dissolution rates from other commonly used surveys.
2.2 Objective two: Distinguish trends by education from other demographic shifts
In recent decades there have been at least four shifts in demographic patterns of
marriage and of educational attainment that have the potential to confound (or explain)
a divergence in marital dissolution rates by women's educational attainment. One of
these is later age at marriage, which is a powerful predictor of low marital dissolution
rates (Booth and Edwards 1985; Moore and Waite 1981) and has been cited as a
primary reason for the overall decline in marital dissolution rates since 1980 (Heaton
2002). If highly educated women are delaying marriage more than other women, this
trend might explain why highly educated women's marital dissolution rates are
declining while rates for less-educated women are not.
Another pronounced shift in marriage that affects marital dissolution rates is an
increase in the incidence of premarital births. Among women with lower educational
attainment, first marriages are increasingly likely to follow a nonmarital birth
(Upchurch, Lillard and Panis 2001). This trend might explain why less-educated
women's marital dissolution rates remain high while rates for highly educated women
are declining.
A third demographic factor correlated with educational attainment is race;
Sweeney and Phillips (2004) have documented diverging racial trends in marital
dissolution rates that could be conflated with educational trends in the absence of
appropriate statistical controls.
The three potential confounds described above (age at marriage, premarital births,
and race and ethnicity) can be statistically controlled with the data available for this
analysis. However, a final demographic factor correlated with a wife's education is her
husband's characteristics. Husbands' education levels have also increased in recent
decades, and educational homogamy has also increased (Schwartz and Mare 2005). As
a result, it is impossible to tell from this analysis what part a divergence in marital
dissolution rates by wives' educational attainment is attributable to husbands' education
and other economic and social variables. South (2001) and Teachman (2002) included
controls for spousal characteristics in their analyses, but this is not possible in the
current study. The SIPP does not gather retrospective information on the characteristics
of first husbands for women who have experienced a marital dissolution.

http://www.demographic-research.org 541
2.3 Objective three: Identify the time period over which divergence has occurred
Although a causal analysis of why marital dissolution might be diverging by women's
educational attainment is beyond the scope of this paper, confirmation of educational
divergence in marital dissolution rates within a specific time period would encourage
future exploration of economic, cultural, and ideological factors particularly salient in
that time period. For example, both marital dissolution rates and women's labor force
participation rates were rapidly increasing in the 1960s and 1970s, so interest naturally
focused on gendered theories of marital dissolution. After the mid-1970s, educational
differences in women's labor force involvement changed less (c.f. Blau 1998), whereas
other factors became more salient. One of these new factors is income inequality
between educational groups (McCall 2000; Morris and Western 1999), but many other
factors have changed as well, including social awareness of the negative consequences
of divorce (Waite and Gallagher 2000), family policies (Bogensheider 2000) and a
cooling of some liberal attitudes about the family (Blankenhorn 2002).
In this paper, I analyze trends in marital dissolution rates for U.S. women entering
a first marriage from 1975 to 1994 and compare patterns for women of different
educational attainment. To do this, I measure education by educational percentile, by
educational attainment at interview, and with a time-varying measure of educational
attainment during a woman's first marriage. I use a multivariate analysis to identify
any portion of an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates that might be
attributed to recent changes in age at marriage, prevalence in premarital childbearing, or
diverging marital dissolution rates across racial groups of women. Finally, I use
supplemental information on earlier marriage cohorts to evaluate whether educational
divergence started with the mid-1970s marriage cohorts or at some earlier time.
3. Data and methods
3.1 Data
In these analyses I use the 1996 and 2001 Surveys of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) (U.S. Census Bureau 2001) and limit the sample to U.S.-born women with a first
marriage from 1975 through 1994. Total sample size is 16,756 women, including 4255
married in 1975 ­ 79, 4381 married in 1980 ­ 84, 4208 married in 1985 ­ 89, and 3912
married in 1990 ­ 94. By excluding foreign-born women, I obtain slightly higher
estimates for marital dissolution rates for women with no high school diploma than
otherwise. I also limit the sample to exclude men due to concerns about data quality.
In sensitivity analyses comparing men and women in the SIPP sample, men reported
Martin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States
542 http://www.demographic-research.org
fewer marital dissolutions than women, particularly at recall durations more than fifteen
and fewer than three years. Finally, I limit this analysis to first marriages, due to space
constraints. Analyses of trends in second marriages, for men, and for foreign-born
women are available on request.
The Wave 2 Topical Modules of the SIPP contain event histories for respondents'
first, second, and most recent marriages, as well as a retrospective education history.
For marital dissolutions, the SIPP marital histories identify dates of permanent
separation as well as divorce (termination). The SIPP provides fewer explanatory
variables than the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) or the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID), but these alternate data sources have a much smaller
effective sample size. The SIPP is the largest survey with an education history that can
be matched to a marital history. The fact that this information is available in Wave 2
alleviates some concerns about sampling attrition in subsequent waves of the SIPP. For
comparison, the appendix includes summary statistics on marital dissolution rates and
trends from the NSFG, PSID, and the marital and fertility history supplements of the
Current Population Survey (CPS).
The outcome variable in this analysis is whether a woman reports a permanent
separation (including but not limited to divorce) within ten years of first marriage.
Women who do not report a permanent separation within ten years of a first marriage
are censored from the analysis at the ten-year point. Because a few women who report
a recent but permanent separation at the time of the survey subsequently reconcile those
marriages Martin and Bumpass (1989) recommend censoring marital dissolution
histories 12 months before interview. I do not use this correction because it can
introduce systematic bias in life table estimates for data sets (like the SIPP) that report
outcomes on an annual rather than monthly basis. Censoring all marital histories at the
first or second year before interview, or counting only divorce as a marital dissolution,
does not alter the main findings of this study. Findings from Raley and Bumpass
(2003) suggest that education*trend patterns in union dissolution (including cohabiting
unions with marriages) are not dissimilar from education*trend patterns in marital
dissolution, but the SIPP does not include a cohabitation history to confirm this finding.
In this study, the key explanatory variables are the year of a woman's first
marriage and her educational attainment. In the descriptive analysis, I identify
woman's education using the most common fixed measure of education ­ the level of
education at interview (no high school diploma, high school diploma or equivalent,
some college, four-year college degree, and master's or professional degree). I also
generate a percentile score for the education distribution of each 5-year marriage cohort
and identify each woman as being in the top, middle, or bottom third of her respective
education distribution. For college graduate women, I show descriptive statistics based
on the time women complete their education, relative to marriage. Finally, in the
Demographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20
http://www.demographic-research.org 543
multivariate analyses, I treat educational attainment as a fully time-varying covariate for
all women, so that a woman's yearly risk of marital dissolution is estimated based on
her educational attainment in that specific year. The SIPP education history makes this
time-varying specification possible. In the multivariate analysis I also control for age at
first marriage, whether a first marriage was preceded by a premarital birth, and race or
ethnic group.
A significant concern in this analysis is the potential for response error in the
retrospective reports of the marital and education histories. Response error can be
correlated with both educational attainment and duration of retrospection, the main
coefficients under investigation in this study. I checked the results from the SIPP using
descriptive life tables from the marital histories of all six cycles of the NSFG from 1973
to 2002; the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) from 1969 to 2001; and the June
Current Population Survey (CPS) marriage and fertility supplements for June 1985,
1990, and 1995. All surveys showed trends consistent with those from the SIPP. The
educational divergence since 1975 was less pronounced in the NSFG and PSID than in
the SIPP, and slightly more pronounced in the CPS. I also checked for possible
correlations between response duration and survey error by comparing SIPP 1996 and
SIPP 2001 reports for the same marriage cohorts at different recall durations, and I
found no systematic variation of marital dissolution patterns by response duration.
As a final check, I looked for evidence of post-dissolution educational attainment
as a source of response error. While the prevalence of response error is unknown, the
severity of its potential effects can be inferred from the relative frequency of women's
educational transitions within and after marriage. If response errors in event histories
occur randomly and in random directions, misreports that place education after (rather
than before) a marital dissolution and those that place education before (rather than
after) a marital dissolution should balance out. However, if a marital dissolution
increases the true rate at which women subsequently complete additional education,
then response errors will not balance out, but will inflate the measured marital
dissolution rates for women with education within marriage. In separate sensitivity
analyses, I estimated coefficients for the effect of marital dissolution on women's rates
of educational transitions. I found evidence that a marital dissolution increases
women's rates of transitions to high school completion, some college, and master's or
professional degree attainment, but not for the transition to a four-year college degree. I
then estimated models with education at interview instead of time-varying coefficients
for education, and found that the coefficients for divergence patterns were slightly
smaller than those shown here but remained statistically significant, indicating that
some proportion of the educational divergence in marital dissolution patterns is taking
place among women who complete their education within marriage (or report doing so).

3.2 Analytic approach
In the descriptive analysis, I analyze trends in marital dissolutions for first marriages
from 1975 to 1994 using SIPP data and employing a Kaplan-Meier life table procedure
to identify the outcome of a marital dissolution within 10 years of a first marriage. I
then summarize results from marriage cohorts of the SIPP dating back to 1960 to make
a rough estimate of the time when marital dissolution rates began to diverge by
educational attainment.
In the multivariate part of the analysis, I measure coefficients for educational
attainment on the yearly hazard of a marital dissolution. The objective of the
multivariate analysis is to find out whether trends in marital dissolution rates by
women's educational attainment might be parsimoniously explained by other
demographic variables known to partly explain trends in marital dissolution rates. To
control for the possibility that educational trends in marital dissolution rates might
inappropriately reflect shifts in the proportion of women who complete their education
after marriage (or even after a marital dissolution), I use the time-varying measure of
educational attainment in the multivariate analysis rather than education at interview. I
employ Cox proportional hazard models to control for marital duration and censor all
observations after 10 years of a first marriage (For a review of event history models, see
Cox and Oakes 1984).
The Cox proportional hazard models identify the coefficient for each covariate on
the yearly rate or hazard of a marital dissolution. I specify the yearly hazard h(t) as a
function of respondent characteristics for age and race (xi
), age at marriage and
incidence of a premarital first birth (xj
), year of first marriage (y), and duration since
marriage (ti
) as represented below:
Model 1: Log h(t) = 0
+ i
xi
+ y + xi
y + (t).
Model 2: Log h(t) = 0
+ i
xi
+ y + xi
y + (t) + j
xj
.
For the term y representing the year of first marriage, year 1975 is rescaled to 0,
and the term xi
y captures the interaction between year of marriage and each of the
dichotomous variables for education and race. I include race*year interactions because
Sweeney and Phillips (2004) found such interactions in a previous study. Hence, the
models estimate two coefficients for each education and race variable: a "main effect"
as of first marriages formed in 1975, and an interaction between each explanatory
variable and year of first marriage that identifies the extent to which trends in marital
dissolution rates have changed by that variable for first marriages formed after 1975.
The term (t) implicitly captures the duration dependency of marital dissolution rates
through the Cox proportional hazard specification.
Demographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20
http://www.demographic-research.org 545
The second model adds the series of dichotomous controls for age at marriage and
incidence of a premarital birth. In sensitivity analyses, the year*age at marriage
coefficients did not increase the model fit enough to justify inclusion in the main
models (results available on request). The main findings of this analysis were robust
with respect to this and other alternative model specifications.
The models shown in this paper use only a single duration dependency coefficient
and only one time span ­ ten years. There are several possible ways that the hazard of a
marital dissolution might not be proportional with respect to duration, and other studies
have found some evidence for such dependency (c.f. South 2001). Some possible
interactions include year of marriage*duration, age at marriage*duration, and education
level*duration. Various sensitivity analyses with different controls for nonproportional
hazards did not affect the substantive results. Also, alternative models with 5-year
durations, 15-year durations, and open-ended durations did not affect the substantive
results. In any case, the reader should be cautioned that the coefficients from these
models reflect group differences that are averaged across the first ten years of marriage.
4. Results
The descriptive results show that it is unlikely that recent increases in women's
educational attainment have contributed to the observed decline in marital dissolution
rates for women with four-year college degrees. Indeed, marital dissolution rates are
actually rather high in the upper-middle part of the education distribution that is
presumably the source of the increasing numbers of college graduates. Although
shifting educational attainment could explain part or all of the observed increase in
marital dissolution rates at the very lowest education level (because women with no
high school diploma are an increasingly small and select proportion of the total
population), a comparison between the top third and the remaining two thirds of the
education distribution still shows a clear pattern of divergence in marital dissolution
rates.

Table 1 shows life table estimates for the proportions of U.S. women with a
marital dissolution within ten years of first marriage for five-year marriage cohorts from
1975-79 to 1990-1994. An additional column compares the proportions experiencing a
marital dissolution in the 1975-79 and 1990-1994 marriage cohorts, along with
statistical significance levels from a simple t-test for the difference between the
proportions.
Additional rows in Table 1 separate marital dissolution rates by timing of four-year
college degree relative to marriage. The results show that timing of completed
education relative to marriage is an important determinant of the probability of a marital
dissolution, and that a time-varying specification for current educational attainment in
each year of a marriage might be more appropriate than a specification based on
education at interview or at the time of marriage. Historically, marital dissolution rates
were lowest among women who complete a four-year college degree before marriage,
but dropped most rapidly for women who complete a four-year college degree after
marriage. Table 1, shows, however, that for the 1975-79 marriage cohort in particular,
Demographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20
http://www.demographic-research.org 547
women who finished a college degree after marriage had divorce rates similar to
women with no college degree, rather than to women who received a college degree
before marriage. Finally, women who complete their four-year college degree more
than ten years after marriage have marital dissolution rates comparable to women with
no college degree. For these women (who are most numerous in the marriage cohorts
with the longest recall durations), educational attainment at interview is clearly not a
good predictor of marital dissolution rates.
Table 2 describes the variables in the event history model, with separate statistics
for the 1975 ­ 1979 and 1990 ­ 1994 marriage cohorts to highlight trends in the
distribution of covariates. Table 2 measures educational attainment at two points in
time for each respondent to capture some of the time-varying nature in this variable (In
the actual hazard models, education is coded as a fully time-varying covariate).
Education at marriage has increased more than education at censoring, in part because
age at marriage has increased dramatically and women are increasingly likely to
complete their education before marrying. Hence, the timing of educational attainment
is correlated with marriage cohort for the time period of this study. Compared to
women in earlier marriage cohorts, women in more recent cohorts were more likely to
have a constant (completed) education level throughout the first ten years of marriage.
Also, age at marriage has increased dramatically, as has the proportion of women
entering a first marriage having already had a premarital birth.

Table 3 shows results from the multivariate analysis. Model A includes covariates
for educational attainment, race, year of marriage, interactions between year of
marriage and educational attainment and interactions between year of marriage and
race. Education was already a strong predictor of marital dissolution for first marriages
as of 1975, as shown by the main coefficients for education. For example, compared to
the comparison category of women with a four-year college degree, women with no
high school diploma had a marital dissolution rate exp(1.67) or 1.95 times as high,
controlling for race. The coefficient for year of marriage shows that for the (omitted)
category of women with a four-year college degree, marital dissolution rates declined
across year of marriage by a factor of exp(-.038) or .963 each year. For women with no
high school diploma, the interaction term for year of marriage*no high school diploma
indicates that marital dissolution rates increased across year of marriage by a factor of
exp(.048) or 1.049 each year, relative to the (declining) baseline trend for women with a
four-year college degree.
Model B adds covariates for age at marriage and incidence of a premarital birth.
When these variables are added to the model, the main coefficients for education are no
longer statistically significant, indicating that for marriages around 1975, much of the
difference in marital dissolution rates across educational levels was explained by the
fact that highly educated women married at older ages than less educated women.
Similarly, the negative coefficient for year of marriage is smaller in Model B than in
Model A, indicating that for the comparison group of women with a four-year college
degree, some part of the decline in marital dissolution rates over time is explained by
increasing age at marriage for college-educated women. However, the coefficients for
interactions between year of marriage and educational attainment are just as
pronounced in Model B as in Model A. In other words, marriage timing can partly
explain differences in marital dissolution rates across education levels, as well as
overall trends across marriage cohorts, but cannot explain the differences in trends that
constitute the educational divergence in marital dissolution rates.
One explanation for the persistence of a pattern of educational divergence in
Model B is that age at marriage has increased for women of all educational levels. In
addition, women of lower educational attainment marry younger than women of higher
educational attainment, and the effects of a shift in age at marriage are more
pronounced at young ages (say, 18 versus 20) than at older ages (say, 24 versus 27).
Among women of high educational attainment, marital dissolution rates would have
decreased less dramatically were it not for increasing age at marriage, but among
women of lower educational attainment, marital dissolution rates would have increased
more dramatically were it not for increasing age at marriage, so the magnitude of
educational divergence would have stayed roughly the same.
Demographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20
http://www.demographic-research.org 551
To illustrate this point, I have used the coefficients from Model B in Table 3 to
predict relative marital dissolution rates for women of different education levels who
entered a first marriage in 1975 and 1990, respectively. Table 4 shows the result of this
computational exercise. Compared to the descriptive results in Table 1, the results in
Table 4 show a shallower decline in marital dissolution rates for college graduates, but
a steeper rise in marital dissolution rates for women of lower educational attainment.

Figure 1 summarizes trends across a longer time span than in the main analysis,
with results dating back to the 1960 ­ 64 marriage cohort. These results indicate that
highly educated women have had lower marital dissolution rates than other women for
at least several decades. However, educational differences in marital dissolution rates
became much more pronounced only after the 1975 ­ 79 marriage cohort. Because
women in marriage cohorts of the 1960s and 1970s had to recall their marital histories
up to 40 years, the results for these cohorts are more vulnerable to response errors and
selection concerns than the results for more recent marriage cohorts.

5. Conclusion
5.1 Confirming an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates
The results show that marital dissolution rates have indeed been diverging by women's
educational attainment. Furthermore, little or none of the trend within each educational
level is explained as a result of overall increases in educational attainment.
Across marriage cohorts, women became somewhat less likely to complete their
education after they married, a pattern that could explain some of the observed decline

in marital dissolution rates for highly educated women. However, patterns indicating
an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates remain robust and strongly
statistically significant in event history models that use a time-varying measure of
education to control for changes in the timing of education relative to marriage.
Descriptive statistics show the greatest declines in marital dissolution among college
graduate women whose completion of a college degree came after their first marriage.
Instead of explaining away a spurious trend in marital dissolution rates, the time-
varying specification of education effectively captures a real trend.
5.2 Distinguishing trends by education from other demographic shifts
Results from Tables 3 and 4 show that the increasing educational divergence in marital
dissolution rates after the 1975 marriage cohort appears to be independent of changes in
age at marriage, increasing incidence of premarital first births among less-educated
women, or shifting racial patterns of marital dissolution. The use of statistical controls
for age at marriage and premarital childbearing leads to a potentially troubling
interpretation of recent trends in marital dissolution rates. For groups of women with
less than a four-year college degree, observed marital dissolution rates are steady or
only slightly increasing. However, net of demographic controls (chiefly for age at
marriage), marital dissolution rates for less educated women are clearly rising; their
marriages are becoming more unstable even as marriages become more stable for
highly educated women.
5.3 Identifying the time period over which divergence has occurred
Results from Figure 1 suggest that prior to the 1975 marriage cohort, educational
differences in marital dissolution rates were large but not increasing. This pattern may
explain part of the discrepancy between longer-term analyses that found little or no
education-by-trend interaction in marital dissolution rates (Teachman 2002; South
2001) and shorter-term analyses that found an education-by-trend interaction (Sweeney
and Phillips 2004; Raley and Bumpass 2003). However, the studies differ in other
respects, such as the use of statistical controls for husband characteristics, specification
of age at marriage, and specification of marital duration.
Finally, whereas the recent educational divergence in marital dissolution rates is
not explained by other demographic factors, the educational differences that existed in
1975 are at least partly explained by differences in age at marriage across educational
groups. This finding strengthens the case that a new relationship between women's
Martin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States

education and marital dissolution is emerging; a relationship quite different from that
which existed up to the mid-1970s.

Appendix
Comparison of results from the SIPP with results from other data sources
Table A1 shows that marital dissolution patterns reported in the SIPP are mostly
consistent with patterns reported in other commonly used data sources, in terms of
overall levels, trends, educational differences, and divergence by education level.
However, the uncertainty in the estimates is quite large for each data set, and the
various data sets each have their own concerns about data quality.
The NSFG has two concerns worth mentioning. One is that the sampling frame of
the survey (age 15 ­ 44) results in an average interview age of about 30. This means
that most marriages are censored by an interview before 10 years of duration, and many
more marriages are excluded from the sample altogether. Hence, the results from the
NSFG series should be thought of as skewed toward marriages entered at younger ages,
with potentially confounding effects for both educational differences and trend
estimates. The second concern is a possible problem with the administration of the
2002 NSFG that resulted in imputed data for many women who reported a first marital
dissolution. I included data from the 2002 NSFG only for estimates for the 1990 ­
1994 marriage cohort, and results for this cohort should be interpreted with caution.
The PSID also has two concerns worth mentioning. One is that the PSID has a
very small sample size, with only about 200 college graduate women in each marriage
cohort. The other concern is that I noted substantial deviations between the weighted
and unweighted estimates for marital dissolution rates for certain cohorts. Most
notably, the 1970 ­ 1974 cohort of college graduate women had a weighted 11.5
percent with a marital dissolution within 10 years, but the unweighted counts for the
same rate showed 36 of 179 women, or 20.1 percent, with a marital dissolution in the
same interval. The unweighted rates for the 1970 ­ 1974 cohort of college graduate
women in the PSID were consistent with rates for other data sets, but the weighted
scores were well outside the norm. Because my main analysis excludes the 1970 ­
1974 marriage cohort, this discrepancy is not a significant concern. South's (2001)
analysis of trends in marital dissolution rates in the PSID did not use weighted
coefficients but did include controls for the race and socioeconomic variables that were
used to determine the weighting scheme, so it is not clear how this issue might affect
the results of South's analysis with respect to trends in marital dissolution rates by
women's education.
