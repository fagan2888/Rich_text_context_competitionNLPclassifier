Disease Variables and Psychological
Problems
Childhood chronic illness is any medical illness or disability
that affects children for an extended period of time, often for
life (Garrison & McQuiston, 1989). A chronic illness inca-
pacitates or significantly impairs a child's sensory, physical,
and mental aspects, interferes with his or her daily function-
ing, and is only manageable but seldom curable. Studies sug-
gest that the family of a chronically ill child experiences
denial, disbelief, distress, depression, guilt, "burden of
responsibility," a "changed identity," family conflict and
resentment in response to the child's illness (Coffey, 2006;
Jusiene & Kuchinskas, 2004; Reiter-Purtill et al., 2008).
Prevalence studies suggest that 15% to 18% of all children
in the United States suffer from a chronic health condition
(Judson, 2004); about 33% of Medicaid children in the U.S.
have a chronic health condition (Heflinger & Saunders, 2005).
Survey studies conducted in Malaysia indicate that approxi-
mately one child below 12 years is diagnosed with cancer per
week(MoreChildrenStrickenbyCancer,2002)andtheNational
Cancer Registry records about 42,985 new cancer entries each
year (Chye & Yahaya, 2004). The number of children suffering
from asthma has increased from 10% to 13% between 1995 and
2002 (Menangani masalah asma, 2002; Othman, 2003) and
prevalence of epilepsy among children is estimated at 0.5%
(Guide for Nurses, 2003; Manonmani & Tan, 1999).
The results of a National Health and Morbidity Survey
indicate a significant proportion of children suffering from
asthma, cancer, and other physical disabilities also show psy-
chological problems (Toh et al., 1999).
Other studies indicate that chronically ill children are at a
greater risk of maladjustment, and mental health and psycho-
logical problems than children without such conditions
(Caplan et al., 2005; Glazebrook, Hollis, Heussler, Goodman,
& Coates, 2003; Judson, 2004; Zeegers et al., 2010).
As regard the link between a chronic illness and specific
psychological problems, studies have found emotional and
psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression,
among children and adolescents suffering from chronic ill-
nesses (Caplan et al., 2005; Jaffee et al., 2005; Jusiene &
Kuchinskas, 2004), difficulties in peer group relationships
(Berge & Patterson, 2004; Parkes et al., 2008), behavior
problems (Fagnano et al., 2009; Halterman et al., 2006), low
social self-esteem and high social anxiety (Meijer, Sinnema,
Bijstra, Mellenbergh, & Wolters, 2002), health risk behav-
iors (Surís, Michaud,Akre, & Sawyer, 2008), stronger beliefs

Hospitalization, Later Onset of the
Disease, and Psychological Problems of
Chronically Ill Children
Ashiq Ali Shah1 and Azizah Othman2
Abstract
This study examined disease-related variables that are thought to play some role in exacerbating psychological problems
among chronically ill children. The participants included 63 parents of children suffering from cancer, epilepsy, and asthma. The
parents rated their children's behavioral and emotional problems and provided information on the frequency of hospitalization,
onset, and duration of the illness and the age of the child at the disease onset. The Child Behavior Checklist was used.
Multiple-regression analysis and correlations were computed to determine the relationship of disease-related variables to the
psychological problems of the children. One-way, between-subject ANOVA was used to analyze the psychological problems
of children of different age groups. The results showed positive relationships between the frequency of hospitalization and
the later onset of the illness and the psychological problems among children. It also showed that children in the age group of
7 to 11 years had the highest number of problems compared with other age groups. The psychological healing aspects of the
family and the culture on the children's illnesses in the collectivist societies have been discussed.

in external control (Garrison & McQuiston, 1989), and inter-
nalizing problems (Alati et al., 2005). These broad findings
show that chronic illnesses negatively affect the physical and
psychological well-being of children. In addition, many "dis-
ease-related" variables related to the life circumstances of
chronically ill children may also affect their psychological
well-being.
Disease-related variables may include the frequency of
hospitalization, the duration of illness, the age of the child at
the onset of illness, the child's age and the gender. Research
shows that frequent hospital admissions, at least in the short
term, cause adverse effects on the child's well-being, and
expose him or her to a number of stressors, which include
stress of separation from the family, school and friends, pain
of treatment, unfamiliarity of the surroundings, and fear of
the unknown (Pao, Ballard, & Rosenstein, 2007). Studies
also suggest that physical stressors experienced during the
hospital stay are related to psychological distress among
chronically ill children (Saylor et al., 1987). Other adverse
hospitalization-related effects include trouble sleeping at
night, bad food, lack of privacy, and experiencing medical
procedures as more disturbing than the illness itself or the
pain (Spirito, Stark, & Tyc, 1994). Recurrent hospitalization
of chronically ill children is also associated with physical
dysfunctions (Kelly & Hewson, 2001), and an increase in
behavioral problems after being discharged from the hospi-
tal, regardless of age or medical condition (Thompson &
Vernon, 1993).
Another factor related to the psychological problems
among chronically ill children is the duration of disease. A
number of studies of chronically ill children indicate severe
adjustment problems with extended illness into adolescence
(Jacobson et al., 1997; Tebbi, Bromberg, Sills, Cukierman, &
Piedmonte, 1990).
The onset of illness at a specific age may also affect the
physical, social, and cognitive development of a child and
her or his well-being. Different studies show that children
with later onset of illness compared with earlier onset show
greater psychological problems (Johnson & Meltzer, 2002),
have more difficulties in adjusting to their disease (Brown,
Kaslow, Sansbury, Meacham, & Culler, 1991), and exhibit
greater internalizing and externalizing problems (Schoenherr,
Brown, Baldwin, & Kaslow, 1992).
Our study examined the impact of three factors, namely,
the frequency of hospitalization, the duration of illness, and
the age of the child at the onset of illness on the psychologi-
cal problems among chronically ill children. We selected
three medical categories of oncology, neurology, and respira-
tory problems because they differ on disease-related dimen-
sions, including age of child at the onset of the disease,
duration and severity of illness, perceived prognosis, course,
and degree of interference with the daily living (Kelly &
Hewson, 2001; Schoenherr et al., 1992; Spirito et al., 1994).
However, examining the impact of these factors separately
on the three categories of disease was not possible because of
small sample sizes in each category.
Culture plays a significant role in psychopathology; how-
ever, the research differs in describing its role. The cultural
relativism perspective views culture and psychopathology as
interlinked; a psychological problem can be understood
within the framework of its culture. The opposing view
acknowledges the impact of culture on psychological disor-
ders but looks at the cross-cultural similarities in the psycho-
logical underpinnings and subjective experiences of these
disorders (Matsumoto & Juang, 2013).
The issue is rather complex when it comes to the defini-
tion and the measurement of psychological problems across
different cultures, especially, in the case of children. Children
are more under the dictates of the cultural influences through
their parents and other social institutions. Generally,
researchers define and describe a disorder in a specific cul-
ture and then export their notions to the other cultures
(Kirmayer, 2007). The opponents of this approach empha-
size the cultural specificity of psychological problems
(Marsella & Yamada, 2007), especially the problems with
the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories across
different cultures. Some argue that even translation of some
items of an assessment instrument to another culture might
not make any sense as the language may be very culture spe-
cific (Kleinman, 1995). This suggests the complexity of the
psychometric issues related to the assessment of psychopa-
thology across cultures (Green, 2009).
There is ample evidence that sociocultural factors play a
significant role in health and disease processes (Ahmad,
2000; Cheung, Nelson, Advincula, Cureton, & Canham,
2005; Matsumoto & Juang, 2013; McPherson, Smith-Lovin,
& Brashears, 2006). Cross-cultural studies show that family
and social support in collectivist culture buffer many types of
stresses (Matsumoto & Fletcher, 1996; McPherson et al.,
2006; Triandis, Bontempo, Villareal, Asaim, & Lucca, 1988).
Studies also show that cultural beliefs (Gone, 2010) and reli-
gious and spiritual values and practices (Abu Raiya &
Pargament, 2010) may be mitigating forces in illnesses and
psychopathology to reckon with (Sue, Zane, Hall, & Berger,
2009).
In contrast to the Western studies, we believe that the fam-
ily and the parent­child relationship in the Malaysian col-
lectivist culture may, to some extent, mitigate the negative
impact of disease-related variables (Berry & Hardman,
1998). However, we also feel that as the parent­child rela-
tionship and parental support in a collectivist culture is deep
rooted (Ahmad, 2000; Cheung et al., 2005; Triandis et al.,
1988), any short- or long-term separation of children from
their families may negatively impact the physical and psy-
chological health of the child. This may be, especially, appli-
cable in the case of hospitalization of the child. The first
hypothesis tested was that a greater frequency of hospitaliza-
tions is associated with more psychological problems.
Shah 3
Social contact and participation are part of the life of a
child in Malaysia. Any inability of a child to participate in
everyday social activities may affect the well-being of the
child. The second hypothesis of the study postulates that the
longer the duration of the illness, the children will face more
psychological problems.
A child who has been healthy and enjoyed a carefree life
for most of his or her childhood may react with utter disbelief
and denial when diagnosed with a chronic illness compared
with a child in his or her early childhood. The diagnosis of
chronic illness in the later life compared with the earlier
years of life may have more negative consequences for a
child. The third hypothesis predicts that the later the onset of
the illness, more psychological problems will be experienced
by chronically ill children.
Method
Participants
The participants were 63 parents of chronically ill children
including 51 mothers and 12 fathers in the age range of 20 to
51 years. Majority of the parents were housewives, others
were working in the government or private sector. The par-
ents were recruited from the outdoor pediatric clinics and
wards of Kuala Lumpur General Hospital (GHKL) after they
agreed to participate in the study.
The children were 39 males and 24 females in the age
range of 4 to 17 years. There were 22 children suffering from
cancer, 21 from epilepsy, and 20 from asthma. Twenty-nine
children were the middle child, 15 were the eldest, 17 were
the youngest, and 2 were the only child in the family. As
regard their schooling, 25 children attended school for 1 to 3
years, 15 attended school for 4 to 6 years, 16 attended school
for 7 to 9 years, 5 children attended school for 10 to 12 years,
and 2 children did not yet attend any school. Thirty-four chil-
dren came to the clinic for the follow-up while 29 were hos-
pitalized for the treatment. There were 7 outpatient and 15
hospitalized cancer children. Among epilepsy children, 20
were outpatient and 1 was hospitalized. In the case of asthma
children, 7 were outpatient and 13 were hospitalized.
Detailed demographic characteristics of the respondents and
the children are presented in Table 1.
Measures
A demographic questionnaire and the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) for the age range of 4 to 18 (Achenbach,
1991) were used in the study.
CBCL.CBCL (age 4-18; Achenbach, 1991) was used to
assess the psychological problems of chronically ill children.
The CBCL is a widely used measure to assess behavioral,
emotional, and social problems of children cross-culturally.
The checklist has 118 items and is used to obtain information
about children's competencies and problems from their par-
ents or surrogate parents. Responses are scored on a 3-point
rating scale ranging from "0" through "2" (0 = not true of the
child; 1 = sometimes true of the child; and 2 = very true or
often true of the child) during the past 6 months.
The profile of CBCL displays eight syndromes derived
from the statistical analyses of the problems of 4,455 chil-
dren referred to mental health services, such as withdrawn,
somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems,
thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviors,

and aggressive behaviors. The eight syndromes are catego-
rized into two major groups of disorders, internalizing and
externalizing problems. The externalizing problems involve
children's conflicts with others and comprise of aggressive
and delinquent behavior syndromes. The internalizing
problems consist of disorders of emotion and subjective
inner distress among children such as anxiety and depres-
sion, withdrawn, and somatic complaints (Achenbach,
1991).
The internal consistency of subscales of CBCL ranges
from 0.54 to 0.96 (Achenbach, 1991). Content validity of
CBCL is demonstrated by the ability of nearly all of its items
to discriminate significantly between demographically
matched referred and nonreferred children. Construct valid-
ity is supported by numerous correlates of CBCL scales,
including significant associations with analogous scales on
the Conner's (1996) Parents Questionnaires and the Quay-
Peterson (1983) Revised Behavior Problem Checklist.
Criterion validity is supported by the ability of the CBCL's
quantitative scale scores to discriminate between referred
and nonreferred children after demographic effects were par-
tialled out. Clinical cutoff points on the scale were also
shown to discriminate significantly between demographi-
cally matched referred and nonreferred children (Achenbach,
1991).
The major issues in the use of CBCL in other cultures
pertain to its construct validity, in particular the wording and
the interpretation of the items (Green, 2009; Kleinman, 1995;
Marsella, 2009). However, some major reviews of the use of
CBCL in different cultures show its reliability and validity
(Crijnen, Achenbach, & Verhulst, 1999) but on the other
hand, they also show the variability of its cutoff scores in
different cultures.
Some large-scale studies conducted across 23 cultures
have replicated the factor structure of CBCL (Ivanova et al.,
2010); however, other studies suggest that the factors of
CBCL may not be able to assess some culture-specific
problematic behaviors (Weisz, Weisz, Suwanlert, & Chaiyasit,
2006), a fact which led to the inclusion of culture-specific
behaviors on CBCL (Achenbach et al., 2008). Our earlier
studies using more culture-specific scales to measure the
psychological problem of individuals in the Asian countries
show quite encouraging results (Siddiqi & Shah, 1997;
Malik & Shah, 2007), however, to test the cultural suitabil-
ity of CBCL for the Malaysian population was beyond the
scope of this study. As we used the total scores on CBCL in
our analyses, we did not replicate the factor structure for
our sample. We only computed the internal consistency
index of CBCL as the measure of its reliability for our
sample.
Coefficient alpha was computed to determine the internal
consistency reliability of CBCL for our sample after remov-
ing the following items that had zero variance: behave oppo-
site sex (C5), sexual problem (C73), think about sex (C96),
wish to be opposite (C100), and other problems (C113). The
internal consistency was .94. Interestingly, the authors of
CBCL recommend removing these items when the study is
conducted in Muslim respondents. Another Malaysian study
obtained an average test­retest reliability of .95 after remov-
ing the sexual problem items (Teoh, 2010) from CBCL.
Demographic questionnaire.A demographic questionnaire
was constructed to collect personal and clinical back-
ground data of children and their parents. Information
obtained included children's age, gender, number of sib-
lings, years of schooling, diagnosis of disease, age at the
onset of illness, duration of illness, frequency of hospital-
ization, and current treatment. Demographic parental
information obtained was the gender, age, occupation, and
relationship with the child.
Procedure
Prior to conducting the study, the research proposal was
reviewed and approved by International Islamic University
Malaysia Postgraduate Research and Ethics Committee and
Director of GHKL. The data were collected at the Paediatric
Department, GHKL, which has five pediatric wards and
three outpatient pediatric clinics for children suffering from
medical illnesses. The researcher approached the parents
whose children were either suffering from cancer, epilepsy,
or asthma during their visits to the outpatient clinic or while
accompanying their children in the wards. If both the parents
were present, the mother was requested to fill out the
questionnaire.
First, the researcher explained to the parents the purpose
of the study, which was to know about the psychological and
other problems of chronically ill children. Then, their con-
sent to participate in the study was obtained. They were
assured of the confidentiality of information and about the
least likelihood of adverse effects on them as respondents
and their children following research participation. The
respondents were administered the CBCL and then the
demographic questionnaire. Most of the parents preferred to
be interviewed rather than completing the questionnaires
themselves. The researcher administered the questionnaires
individually. Each interview took 25 to 40 min. After the
interview the researcher thanked the parents and briefed
them on the purpose of the study.
Statistical Analyses
A multiple-regression analysis was used to assess the impact
of disease-related variables (duration of illness, the fre-
quency of hospitalization, and the age of the children at the
onset of the illness) to the psychological problems of
children.
The design also includes a one-way ANOVA on the psy-
chological problems of children for the age of the children at
the onset of the disease.

Results
Preliminary Analyses
A t test for independent samples performed on the psycho-
logical problem scores of outpatient and the hospitalized
children showed a nonsignificant effect. The mean CBCL
score of the outpatients was 59.8 (SD = 23.3) and the hospi-
talized children was 50.5 (SD = 32.3); t = 0.489; ns. This
means that the outpatient and the hospitalized children do not
differ on the psychological problems.
To examine the hospitalization effect for the similarity
vis-à-vis differences in the behavioral problems for the three
disease categories was not possible because of the consider-
able asymmetry in the number of hospitalized cancer, asthma,
and epilepsy children.
Hypothesis Testing
A multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the
significance of disease-related variables to the psychological
problems of children. The duration of illness, the frequency
of hospitalization, and the age of the children at the onset of
the illness were entered as the predictors and the psychologi-
cal problems as the criterion variables in the equation.
One-way, between-subject ANOVA was performed on the
psychological problem scores of children in different age
groups to analyze the differences in their psychological
problems.
Table 2 shows a highly significant effect of multiple-
regression analysis, F(4, 58) = 56.18, p < .001. The results
show that the predictors significantly contribute toward the
psychological problems of the chronically ill children, the
criterion. The multiple correlation (R) was .89, the R2 was
.79, and the adjusted R2 was .78. This shows that 79% of the
variance of the criterion (psychological problems) was
accounted by the predictors, namely frequency of hospital-
ization, age of the children at the onset of illness, and the
duration of illness.
Results in Table 3 show a highly significant relationship
between the frequency of hospitalization and the psychologi-
cal problems (r = .80;  = .61; t = 8.67; p < .001), a signifi-
cant relationship between the age at the onset of illness and
the psychological problems (r = .21;  = .29; t = 4.21; p <
.001), and a nonsignificant relationship between the duration
of illness and the psychological problems of chronically ill
children. These results indicate that more frequently the chil-
dren were hospitalized, and the older the children were when
afflicted by the illness, the more psychological problems
they experienced.
The beta coefficients in Table 3 show highest -weight for
the frequency of hospitalization followed by the age of the
children at the onset of illness. This means that frequency of
hospitalization was the most important predictor of the psy-
chological problems among chronically ill children.
One-way, between-subject ANOVA on the psychological
problem scores of the children for their age in Table 4 shows
a significant difference in the psychological problems of
children in different age groups, F(2, 60) = 12.85, p < .001.
The mean psychological problem score of children in the age
range of 7 to 11 years was the highest (M = 73.2; SD = 23.28),
followed by the age ranges of 11 to 17 years (M = 61.4; SD =
21.04) and 4 to 7 (M = 37.0; SD = 26.0). These results indi-
cate that children in the middle age range suffered from more
psychological problems as compared with the children in the
lower and upper age ranges. An effect size of 2 = .299 (.3)
or 30% shows that the independent variable of age explains a
substantial portion of variance of the dependent variable.
This means that the children's age at the onset of the disease
plays a crucial role in their psychological problems later.
Discussion
This study examined the relationship of three disease-related
variables, namely, frequency of hospitalization, duration of
illness, and age of the children at the onset of illness to the
psychological problems among chronically ill children. The
results supported the first hypothesis of the study that postu-
lated a relationship between the frequency of hospitalization
and psychological problems of chronically ill children. This
implies that frequency of hospital admission is strongly asso-
ciated with the psychological problems among chronically ill
children. Other studies show that frequent hospitalization of
sick children causes psychological dysfunctions (Kelly &
Hewson, 2001; Pao et al., 2007), specifically depression,
emotional difficulties, anxiety, behavioral disturbances, and
aggression (Alati et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 1987). Repeated
or prolonged hospitalization may put excessive demands on
the children because of separation from the family and
friends and restricting their participation in social activities
(Haslum, 1988). This sense of deprivation may make the
children feel inadequate, handicapped, inferior, and
depressed.
A hospitalized child may face the dilemma of adjusting to
an unfamiliar, regimented hospital environment, and painful
medical procedures (Jones, Fiser, & Livingston, 1992).
Exposure to unfamiliar nursing care in a hospital instead of
caring by the parents may cause feelings of helplessness,

embarrassment, and irritation among children. Evidence sug-
gests that dependency and hopelessness result in the feelings
of anxiety, humiliation, withdrawal, apathy, depressed mood,
babyish behavior, throwing tantrums, anger, and aggressive-
ness (Alati et al., 2005; Caplan et al., 2005; Pao et al., 2007;
Zeegers et al., 2010). A study of Malaysian mothers of chil-
dren with cerebral palsy found that repeated or lengthy hos-
pitalization put great demands on the child and the family,
led to the deterioration of caregiver's health and morale, and,
in few cases, to family disintegration (Ong, Afifah, Safiah, &
Lye, 1998).
As mentioned earlier, we could not examine the hospital-
ization effects on the behavioral problems of children
between the three disease categories. However, it is possible
that the hospitalization effects might be very different for the
three disease categories if a bigger sample was studied.
Similarly, big differences in the number of children in dif-
ferent categories of the variables on the "number of siblings"
and the "year of schooling" was an obstacle to performing
meaningful analyses to see their impact on the psychological
problems of children suffering from chronic diseases. We
assume that the number of siblings as well as the years of
schooling might have some mitigating effect on the psycho-
logical problem of these children.
Malaysian children live in a diverse social circle as they
socialize with their relatives and neighbors and visit their
friends after the school. Hospitalization may make sick chil-
dren feel lonely, bored, and predispose them to emotional
and behavioral problems.
Furthermore, a positive relationship between the age of
the children at the onset of illness and the psychological
problems support our second hypothesis. A comparison of
different age groups showed that children in the age of 7 to
11 years had the most psychological problems, followed by
the children in the age ranges of 11 to 17 and 4 to 7 years. A
child who had been healthy for quite some time, the diagno-
sis of chronic illness may devastate the child and force her or
him to adapt to this new unwelcome and unpleasant reality.
Thus, the feelings of anxiety and aggression may be height-
ened during this particular time.
The results of a national survey of psychiatric morbidity
among Malaysian children and adolescents indicated the
highest number of mental health and psychological problems
for 10- to 12-year-old children (15.5%) followed by 13- to
15-year-olds (14.4%) and 5- to 6-year-olds (9.7%), respec-
tively (Toh et al., 1999).
Other findings also suggest that children in the middle
childhood stage experience more problems in dealing with
their illness because they are in the developmental stage
of an increasing need for autonomy, initiative, and mas-
tery of new skills (Garrison & McQuiston, 1989; Witt,
Riley, & Coiro, 2003). Chronic illnesses that impose limi-
tations on physical activity and social interaction restrict
the children's freedom, deprive them of the experiences
crucial to their development of self-esteem, sense of mas-
tery and control over their environment (Meijer et al.,
2002; Perrin & Gerrity, 1984). A sudden change from nor-
mal life to illness in the middle and later childhood takes
its toll in the form of behavioral and emotional problems
(Fagnano et al., 2009; Schoenherr et al., 1992; Surís et al.,
2008); however, children may adjust to and overcome
these difficulties, especially the feelings of depression and
anxiety over time (Jusiene & Kuchinskas, 2004), if family
support and good nurturing is available (Berge & Patterson,
2004).
Our study found no relationship between the duration of
illness and the psychological problems of children in con-
trast to some Western studies (Jacobson et al., 1997;
Matsumoto & Fletcher, 1996; McPherson et al., 2006; Tebbi
et al., 1990). We believe that the collectivist Malaysian soci-
ety with its well-established social support mechanism
(Gone, 2010) may be a mitigating force on the long-term
effects of a chronic illness as it provides opportunities to the
sick children to participate in everyday activities and to be
part of the main stream society (Matsumoto & Fletcher,
1996). The opportunities of social contact and interaction in

negative psychological and physical effects associated with
the duration of sickness (Abu Raiya & Pargament, 2010;
Berry & Hardman, 1998; Triandis et al., 1988).
Conclusion
The outcome of this study may be useful to improving the
psychological well-being of chronically ill children by pro-
posing a culturally relevant approach to taking care of
chronically ill children which may have more promise of
success (Gracia, 2006; Uziel-Miller, Lyons, Kissiel, &
Love, 1998). Our study shows that recurrent hospitalization
and the onset of disease in the middle childhood are the two
factors contributing toward the psychological problems
among chronically ill children. Obviously efforts need to be
made to avoid repeated or prolonged hospitalization of
children.
On the bases of the outcome of our research, especially
the impact of hospitalization on the psychological well-being
of the sick children, we would like to recommend to the
Ministry of Health to develop a comprehensive and sustain-
able training program for the nurses, social workers, psychia-
trists, clinical psychologists, child psychologists, and
counselors to deliver mental health services to the chroni-
cally ill children and adolescents.
Childhood is a vital stage in human development.
Chronically ill children, in particular, demand special care
and attention, to ensure their well-being. Mental and psycho-
logical problems in childhood tend to continue into adult-
hood; hence, they require attention and management at the
earlier stages of sickness.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations because of a small sample
size and a lack of a thorough test of psychometric properties
of CBCL for the Malaysian culture. The scope of the study
did not permit gathering a larger sample size as it was time-
consuming and costly. It took a couple of months to recruit a
sample of 63 parents of chronically sick children as these
childhood illnesses are not common.
As mentioned earlier, we did not test the factor structure
of CBCL as we used only total scores on the scale and did not
analyze differences between different disease categories on
the internalizing and externalizing problems, and so on.
Some disease-specific analyses on some demographic
variables could not be performed because of insufficient
number of subjects in different categories of these variables
such as the differences in the hospitalization effects for the
three disease categories, the years of schooling, and the num-
ber of siblings.
It would be difficult to generalize our findings because of
the small sample and the limited focus of the study; however,
the outcome of this study could provide some useful direc-
tions for future research.
Suggestions for Future Research
The research in the future may focus on contributions of the
Malaysian joint family system as a viable alternative to pro-
viding care to the sick children at home to avoid the adverse
effects of hospitalization for the children. The grandparents
and other family members can take care of sick children.
Future research can also examine if the family members
were trained to take care of a chronically ill child, whether
they do it with more care, involvement, and passion and
whether all this has a positive impact on the well-being of a
child.
The future research may also focus on suggesting certain
measures to lessen the impersonal impact of the hospital on
the sick child if hospitalization were indispensable. The mea-
sure may include provision such as "live in" pediatric wards,
that is, admitting the mother and the child, allowing visits at
all times, and promoting home atmosphere in the ward
through ingenious decoration, lively wall colors, toys, and
books (Kornhauser, 1980).
Another future research focus may be on the role of con-
tinuation of education by sick children irrespective of their
inpatient status. Any impediment of a child's education
because of hospitalization and its relation to the psychologi-
cal problems of the children may suggest the positive impact
of education on the children despite their sickness and hos-
pitalization. Such findings serve as a catalyst for promoting
an education friendly hospitalization atmosphere where the
sick children have the opportunity to learn and to interact
with their teachers and the class mates to enhance their
development.
Future research may also examine the impact of improved
mental health care facilities on the psychological and overall
well-being of sick children. In this regard, it may be impor-
tant to focus on increasing the awareness of the parents, fam-
ily members, and the health care providers about the social
impact of chronic illness on the family system. This will help
the health caregivers to provide effective services and will
empower families to increase their resources, coping behav-
iors, and problem-solving skills to deal with the stressors
involved in caring for a family member with chronic illness
(Coffey, 2006; Livneh & Antonak, 2005).
