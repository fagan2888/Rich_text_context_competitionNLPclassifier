Abstract
Objective: To demonstrate the correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic G protein-coupled
oestrogen receptor (GPR30) expression and clinicopathological features and outcome in patients
with ovarian cancer.
Methods: Nuclear and cytoplasmic GPR30 expressions were determined using immunohisto-
chemistry to identify the intracellular location in tissues from patients with ovarian cancer. Data
were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes.
Results: Tissue samples were obtained from 110 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer between
2005 and 2010. Nuclear GPR30 was significantly more frequent in the group of patients with
recurrence. The presence of nuclear GPR30 predicted lower overall survival) and 5-year
progression-free survival in all patients with ovarian cancer and overall survival in patients with high
grade ovarian cancer. Cytoplasmic GPR30 was observed significantly more often in advanced
ovarian cancer and did not predict survival.
Conclusion: This study showed that nuclear GPR30 is an independent negative prognostic
indicator in patients with ovarian cancer, especially in those with a high grade malignancy.

this contributes to the high mortality rate of
the disease. To date, only a few tumour
biomarkers have been established for high
grade ovarian cancer.5 Serum cancer antigen
(CA) 125, identified in the 1980s, is known
to be an important marker.5,6 However, it is
more useful for guiding treatment rather
than predicting the prognosis in patients
with ovarian cancer.7 The G protein-
coupled oestrogen receptor (GPR30) which
was identified in 2005,7 has been found
in numerous organs8­11 and in primary
carcinomas of these organs.12 Although the
receptor's promotion by oestrogen has been
extensively studied10,11, the potential signal-
ling pathway of GPR30 is still unclear.
The purpose of this study was to deter-
mine the intracellular localization of GPR30
in tissue samples from women with ovarian
cancer and elucidate its impact in the disease.
To this end, nuclear and cytoplasmic GPR30
expressions were correlated with clinico-
pathological characteristics and survival out-
comes in patients with ovarian cancer.
Methods
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were created
from patients with epithelial ovarian cancer
who underwent surgery in the First Affiliated
Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, China
between January 2005 and December 2010.
Each sample was identified by the admission
number of patient. The samples were fixed
with formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Clinicopathological data were collected
before and after surgery and recorded in the
patients' medical records as were five year
follow-up data. Data were extracted and
recorded by two physicians (C.Z. and G.N.)
All TMAs were subjected to immunohis-
tochemistry. Nuclear GPR30 was evaluated
using rabbit polyclonal antibody SP4674P
(Acris Antibodies GmbH, Germany) while
cytoplasmic GPR30 was evaluated using
antibody LS-A4290 (LifeSpan BioSciences,
Germany). Positive controls were made
using multiorganic arrays including breast
tissue known to express GPR30 and nega-
tive controls consisted of GPR30-expressing
ovarian cancer tissue incubated with a
matched isotype antibody.
In brief, all specimens were de-paraffi-
nized in ethanol and subsequently rehy-
drated in a descending graded series of
alcohol concentrations.13 Epitope retrieval
was accomplished by pressure cooking the
samples in a 0.01 M citric acid buffer (pH,
6.0). Endogenous immunoglobulins in the
tissue were blocked by incubating in fresh
3% H2
O2
for 20 minutes at room tempera-
ture. Following multiple washes, all TMAs
were incubated with the GPR30-specific
antibodies, LS-A4290 (3.3g/mL) or SP4674P
(4g/mL) for 60 mins at room temperature.
After scanning with the Nano Zoomer
digital slide scanner (2.0-RS C10730-13,
Hamamatsum, Japan), the immunohisto-
chemical staining analysis was interpreted
by two independent pathologists (H.S. and
H.C.) who were blinded to the clinical data.
Positive GPR30 expression was defined as a
staining intensity of grade 2þ or more from
a scale that ranged from 0 (negative), 1þ
(weak), 2þ (moderate) and 3þ (strong).
Immunofluorescence was used to deter-
mine the intracellular localization of GPR30
in the ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3
(American Type Culture Collection,
Rockville, MD). To block non-specific
binding, viable SKOV-3 cells were pre-
treated with phosphate buffered saline, 1%
bovine serum albumin or 0.1% saponin.
The GPR30-specific antibodies, LS-A4290
(10 g/mL), or SP4674P (5 g/mL), were
applied and incubated with the cells for
30 min, while isotype control was incubated
and diluted to the same final antibody
protein concentration.14
After blocking and washing, secondary
antibodies, Alexa-488 (2 mg/ml) and 4',
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1mg/ml),
were applied. All cells were examined using a
724 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM).
Any blue fluorescence from the DAPI label-
ling suggested nuclear binding while green
fluorescence from Alexa-488 labelling identi-
fied the GPR30 receptor itself.15
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software (version 22.0 for WindowsÕ;
(IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp,
USA). The 2 and Fisher's exact tests were
used and all statistical analyses were 2-sided.
A P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance. Five-year progres-
sion free survival and overall survival
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
methods. Uni- and multi-variate analyses
were performed using intracellular GPR30
expression and clinicopathological data.
Results
Tissue samples were available from 110
patients and their clinicopathological char-
acteristics are listed in Table 1.
GPR30 expression
Nuclear GPR30 expression was observed in
69/110 (62.7%) of patients with ovarian
cancer, while cytoplasmic GPR30 was
observed in 71/110 (64.5%) of patients.
(Table 2). In total, 51/76 (67.1%) of patients
with serous adenocarcinoma and 4/10 (40%)
of patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma
expressed nuclear GPR30. Cytoplasmic
GPR30 was detected in 50/76 (65.8%)
patients with serous adenocarcinoma and
in 4/10 (40.0%) patients with mucinous
adenocarcinoma. There were no statistically
significant differences in the types of adeno-
carcinoma (Table 2).
Nuclear GPR30 was detected in 42/67
(62.7%) of patients with tumour recurrence
and in 27/53 (50.9%) of patients without
recurrence (P ¼ 0.018). There were no other
significant correlations between nuclear
GPR30 expression and other clinicopatho-
logic characteristics (Table 2).
Cytoplasmic GPR30 was observed more
frequently in advanced ovarian cancer with
54/74 (73.0%) patients having International
Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) grades III/IV and 17/36 (47.2%) of

There were no other significant correlations
between cytoplasmic GPR30 expression and
other clinicopathologic features (Table 2).
Intracellular localization of GPR30
None of the viable SKOV-3 cells, including
the negative controls without 0.1% saponin
treatment, displayed green fluorescence.
After pre-treatment with 0.1% saponin,
weak blue fluorescence binding with DAPI
was detected in some nuclei and green
fluorescence binding with Alxea 488 indi-
cated the presence of GPR30. GPR30
showed a granular pattern in the nucleus
when the primary antibody SP4674P was
used, whereas GPR30 was detected in the
cytoplasm when antibody LS-A4290 was
used (Figure 1).

Prognostic impact of GPR30 expression
In patients with ovarian cancer, nuclear
GPR30 expression predicted both a poorer
overall survival (Figure 2a; P ¼ 0.046) and
5-year progression free survival (Figure 2b:
P ¼ 0.046). However, cytoplasmic GPR30
expression was only significantly associated
with poorer overall survival (Figure 2c
P ¼ 0.049) and not 5-year progression free
survival (Figure 2d).
Uni- and multivariate analysis were
performed, with adjustments made for
age, FIGO stage and nuclear grading
(Table 3). Nuclear GPR30 was an inde-
pendently poor prognostic factor for over-
all survival in ovarian cancer patients
(P ¼ 0.035). Cytoplasmic GPR30 expres-
sion was not predictive of overall survival
or 5-year progression free survival. Patient
age predicted overall survival (P ¼ 0.001)
whereas FIGO stages were unfavourable
prognostic factors for both overall survival
(P ¼ 0.01) and 5-year progression free
survival (P ¼ 0.001).
Prognostic impact of GPR30 expression
in high grade ovarian cancer
In patients with high grade ovarian cancer
(n ¼ 69), those with positive nuclear GPR30
expression (n ¼ 44) had significantly poorer
overall survival than those with negative
nuclear GPR30 expression (n ¼ 25;
P ¼ 0.007) (Figure 3). However, there was
no difference between these two groups of
patients in 5-year progression free survival.
Cytoplasmic GPR30 expression was not
significantly correlated with survival in
patients with high grade ovarian cancer.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to
report that nuclear GPR30 expression is a
significant, independent negative prognostic
factor for overall survival in patients with
ovarian cancer, although it does not predict
5-year progression free survival. The study
also found that cytoplasmic GPR30 was not
predictive of patient outcome in ovarian
cancer. Similar results were found in the
subgroup of patients with high grade ovar-
ian cancer. Therefore, we hypothesise that
GPR30 located in the nucleus, rather than in
the cytoplasm, is involved in carcinogenesis.
Interestingly, nuclear GPR30 expression
was common in patients with recurrence
even though it did not predict lower 5-year
progression free survival which previously
has been shown to be associated with
recurrence.14 GPR30 expression was not
significantly correlated with any other
clinicopathological characteristics which
included FIGO stage, nuclear grade status,
histology and the presence of ascites.
Previous studies have failed to define the
role of GPR30 expression in ovarian cancer,
although its expression was widely found in
various cancer cell lines.16­19 One study
reported that GPR30 expression predicted
poor outcome in advanced ovarian cancer, a
finding which supports our observations.20

Another study found that there was no
correlation between GPR30 mRNA and
protein with patients' clinical parameters.21
In that study, only one-third of the patients
had malignant ovarian cancer and the cor-
relation between GPR30 and outcome was
confirmed by univariate analysis which
excluded several clinical characteristics. By
contrast, in this present study, multivariate
analysis was used to determine the impact of
GPR30 on overall survival and 5-year pro-
gression free survival. Our data suggest that
nuclear GPR30 is an independent prognos-
tic factor, even after adjustment for other
prognostic factors such as FIGO stage,
histological grade, and patient age.
We found that GPR30 expression was
not associated with 5-year progression
free survival. By contrast, another study
reported that GPR30 expression played a

positive role in two-year progression free
survival.22 The authors of that report found
that loss of GPR30 expression was observed
in advanced ovarian cancer and predicted a
worse outcome. Unlike the previous study
which spanned two years, we followed our
patients over five years, which may have
accounted for the difference in results.
The intracellular localization of GPR30 is
unclear,23 although GPR30 has been
described as having a 7-membrane spanning
domain.12 In the present study, GPR30
expression was observed in both the cyto-
plasm and nuclei of cells from ovarian
cancer tissues. In vitro, GPR30 expression
was not detected on the membrane of
SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells without pre-
treatment but intracellular GPR30 was
detected after cell pre-treatment with 0.1%
saponin. Saponin form complexes with chol-
esterol to create pores in the cell membrane
bilayers. In addition, the amphipathic
nature of saponin provides it with surfactant
activity which enhances the penetration of
macromolecules through cell membranes.24
Our findings are supported by another study
that also found both cytoplasmic and
nuclear GPR30 staining in ovarian cancer
cells.25
The study had limitations. For instance,
only immunohistochemical staining was
used and the population was confined to
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
Therefore, other studies are required to
elucidate the function and role of GPR30
more fully in ovarian cancer. Two major
questions remain unanswered: the mechan-
ism by which GPR30 aggregates in the
nucleus and the function of nuclear GPR30.
In conclusion, the study showed that
GPR30 expression varied in different histo-
logical subtypes of ovarian cancer. In add-
ition, nuclear GPR30 predicted poor overall
survival and 5-year progression free survival
in patients with ovarian cancer, whereas
cytoplasmic GPR30 expression was not
associated with outcome. The study also
showed that nuclear GPR30 expression was
an independent prognostic factor for overall
survival but not 5-year progression free
survival. Furthermore, nuclear GPR30
significantly predicted lower overall survival
and 5-year progression free survival in
patients with high grade ovarian cancer.
