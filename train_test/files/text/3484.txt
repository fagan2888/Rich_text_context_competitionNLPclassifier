thoracic epidural block
Jin-Woo Park1, Seung-Kil Bae2 and Jin Huh2
Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the anatomical safety margins in relation to thoracic epidural block by
analysing magnetic resonance (MR) images.
Methods: This retrospective study identified consecutive patients who underwent MR imaging of
the thoracic vertebral spine. The distance from the dura mater to the spinal cord (DTC) was
measured at different thoracic intervertebral levels using three different pathways as references:
the `U', `L' and `M' lines.
Results: A total of 346 patients provided MR images for analysis. The vertical DTC was the longest
at the T5/6 intervertebral level (mean Æ SD: 4.22 Æ 1.43 mm) and the shortest at the T11/12
intervertebral level (mean Æ SD: 2.51 Æ 0.87 mm). The DTC was the longest on the `L' line at the
T1/2 and T5/6 intervertebral levels and on the `U' line at the T10/11 intervertebral level. The
difference in DTC between the `U' and `L' lines was the greatest at the T5/6 intervertebral level.
Conclusion: Differences in the DTC were observed among the thoracic intervertebral levels. The
variability of the safety margin according to the angle of needle insertion was the largest at the T5/6
intervertebral level.

Introduction
Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has been
used to treat acute pain after thoracic and
abdominal surgery,1,2 but rare neurological
complications related to epidural analgesia
can be devastating.3 Thus, it is important to
understand the anatomy of the spinal canal
to prevent needle-related neurological injury
to the spinal cord.
The most common method used to iden-
tify the epidural space is the `loss of resist-
ance' (LOR) to either air or fluid technique4
or fluoroscopic guidance. When a dura
puncture occurs, the distance from the
dura mater to the spinal cord (DTC) is a
critical factor in neurological injury caused
by needle trauma.5,6 The longer the DTC is,
the larger the safety margin will be.5,6
The anatomical dimensions related to
TEA, including the DTC, are not uniform
at different vertebral levels;7,8 thus, it is
necessary to investigate the difference in
distance according to the vertebral level
to determine the target level and choose
a safe method of approach. Several
studies have investigated the DTC in
the thoracic region and have reported
that the vertical distance was significantly
greater in the middle thoracic region than at
the upper and lower thoracic levels.7,8
However, these studies examined a relatively
small number of patients and did not
consider the angle at which the needle
approached.7,8 Safety margins can change
at the same vertical DTC using different
approach angles. Previous studies have
investigated the DTC at just three regions,
rather than at all thoracic intervertebral
levels.7,8
The present study retrospectively investi-
gated the DTC at all thoracic segments by
analysing the magnetic resonance (MR)
images of patients. The length from the
skin to the dura mater (STD) and the DTC
at various approach lines from three differ-
ent thoracic vertebral levels were also
examined to understand the shape of the
interspinous space and develop safe
approach strategies.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study identified consecu-
tive patients at the Seoul National
University Boramae Hospital, Seoul,
Republic of Korea who underwent MR
imaging of the thoracic vertebral segments
between January and December 2010.
The MR images were evaluated by
radiologists. Exclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: (i) patients who were diagnosed with
thoracic spinal or medullary disease that
could affect the contour of the spinal cord
and epidural space (e.g. severe compression
fracture, spinal cord tumour or cerebro-
spinal fluid seeding); (ii) patients whose
anatomical dimensions were unclear due to
poor-quality MR images; (iii) patients < 15
years of age.
Ethical approval was provided by the
Institutional Review Board of Seoul
National University Boramae Hospital,
Seoul, Republic of Korea (reference
number: 20120507/06-2012-102/119), which
also granted a waiver of informed consent
for this retrospective study. This study was
registered with the Clinical Research
Information Service (http://cris.nih.go.kr/
cris/en/use_guide/cris_introduce.jsp; refer-
ence number: KCT0001881).
Magnetic resonance image analyses
Magnetic resonance imaging was under-
taken on a MAGNETOMÕ Verio 3.0 T
scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
T2-weighted spine MR images were
acquired in the sagittal plane closest to the
midline of the vertebral column using a
Picture Archiving and Communication
System (INFINITT Healthcare, Seoul,
Republic of Korea). Three independent
medical observers trained in identifying
Park et al. 951
spinal canal anatomy reviewed the images.
The most appropriate plane was evaluated
at each level and all dimensions are mea-
sured using a Preview program (Maroview
5.4; INFINITT Healthcare).
The vertical DTC was measured at each
thoracic intervertebral level. The line on the
vertical DTC was estimated to be perpen-
dicular to the spinal cord and dura mater at
each level and started from the midpoint
between two adjacent vertebral bodies
(Figure 1). The STD and DTC were mea-
sured on three different approach pathways
at the upper (T1/2), middle (T5/6), and
lower (T10/11) thoracic intervertebral
levels. The first approach pathway was the
`U' line. The `U' line was defined as the line
contacting the lower border of the spinous
process of the adjacent upper vertebra at the
thoracic intervertebral level. The second was
the `L' line, which contacted the upper
border of the spinous process of the lower
vertebra at the thoracic intervertebral space.
Therefore, the `U' and `L' lines were the
upper and lower borders of the interspinous
space, respectively, and were selected to
evaluate the distinct outlines of the inter-
spinous space at different thoracic regions
and to demonstrate differences in the safety
margin according to various approach
angles. The third was the `M' line, which
passed the midpoint of two spinous process
tips and the point that bisected the ligament
flavum between the two spinous processes.
The `M' line was supposed to represent
a blind approach using the LOR technique.
When performing TEA, a physician
touches two tips of adjacent spinous pro-
cesses over the skin and searches for the
interspinous space. The midpoint of two
adjacent tips was selected as a point on
the `M' line. Using the blind technique,
a needle can pass several courses in the
interspinous space. It was assumed that the
point bisecting the ligamentum flavum
between the two processes suggested the
average of many possible courses and
chose that point as another mark on the
`M' line.
The angles between the `U' and `L' lines
at the T1/2, T5/6, and T10/11 intervertebral
levels were examined to analyse the trend in
the borders of the interspinous spaces and to
evaluate variability in the approach angle at
each intervertebral level (Figure 1).
Statistical analyses
For each variable (DTC and STD), an
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was
calculated to quantify agreement between
measurements: slight (0.00­0.19), fair

vertical distance from the dura mater to the spinal
cord (DTC) was estimated to be perpendicular to
the spinal cord (SC) and dura mater at each level and
started from the midpoint between the two adja-
cent vertebral bodies. The `U' line is the line
contacting the upper border of the interspinous
space and the `L' line contacts the lower border of
the interspinous space. The `M' line passes the
midpoint of two spinous process tips and the point
that bisects the ligamentum flavum between the two
spinous processes.

(0.80­1.0) agreement.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous variables are
expressed as the mean Æ SD and were com-
pared using paired t-tests. Multiple pairwise
comparisons were made using the
Bonferroni correction. A P-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
This retrospective study identified 870 con-
secutive patients who had undergone MR
imaging of the thoracic vertebral segments.
Of these, 421 patients who were diagnosed
with thoracic spinal or medullary disease
that could affect the contour of the spinal
cord and epidural space, 67 patients whose
anatomical dimensions were unclear due to
poor-quality MR images and 36 patients
who were<15 years of age were excluded.
A total of 346 MRI images from 177 males
and 169 females were evaluated and their
demographic characteristics are presented in
Table 1.
The vertical DTC was the longest at the
T5/6 level and the shortest at the T11/12
level (4.22 Æ 1.43 and 2.51 Æ 0.87 mm,
respectively) (Table 2). A significant differ-
ence was observed for the DTC at all
intervertebral levels compared with the adja-
cent levels, indicating a significant difference
in the safety margin between adjacent thor-
acic levels (P < 0.01; Bonferroni correction).
The STD and DTC were the longest on
the `L' line at the T1/2 and T5/6 levels; and
longest on the `U' line at the T10/11 level
(Table 3). The angle between the `U' and `L'
lines was the largest at the T1/2 level,
narrowed from the upper to the lower
region, and the difference in DTC between
the `U' and `L' lines was the greatest at the
T5/6 intervertebral level, where the vertical
DTC was the longest (Table 4). In 32 of 346
patients (9%), the `M' lines at the T10/11
intervertebral level did not pass through the
interspinous space on the MR images.

Discussion
The course of needle insertion when per-
forming TEA using the midline approach is
from the skin to the ligamentum flavum, and
the needle should stop before piercing the
dura mater for correct epidural needle
placement. However, accidental dura
puncture during epidural analgesia occurs
in 0.4­6.0% of patients.9
This present study identified the anatom-
ical dimensions of the thoracic spinal canal
in relation to TEA by MR imaging.
Reproducibility of measurements was ver-
ified by calculation of the ICCs between
measurements. These current results
revealed that the vertical DTC was longer
in the middle thoracic region than at the
upper or lower thoracic levels and the
shortest at the T11/12 levels. These current
results were in good agreement with prior
studies of the thoracic spinal canal.8,10 The
spinal cord in the middle thoracic area is
situated more ventrally, but the spinal cord
occupies more space at the upper and lower
thoracic levels because of cervical and
lumbar enlargement. Several previous stu-
dies indicated that ligamentum flavum mid-
line gaps at the thoracic vertebral levels were
more frequent than at the lumbar levels but

less frequent at the cervical levels.11­13 The
peak incidence among the thoracic vertebral
levels was found in the region between T10
and T12.12 Midline gaps were also frequent
at the upper thoracic level.13 In contrast to
the hanging-drop technique, the LOR tech-
nique is considered to be dependent on the
penetration of the ligamentum flavum.4
Therefore, the midline approach using the
LOR technique at the lower or upper thor-
acic level could be especially dangerous, not
only due to a short DTC but also due to the
midline fusion defect.
This present study investigated the verti-
cal DTC at all thoracic levels and the current
results will be helpful to determine the level
at which epidural catheterization should be
performed. Because a comparable effect of
TEA can be expected from different thoracic
levels by adjusting the drug dose or extent of
catheter insertion, there are several possible
target levels for needle insertion for an
intended level of segmental block.
Therefore, a significant difference in the
vertical DTC between adjacent thoracic
intervertebral levels is valuable to select an
insertion point with a larger safety margin.
Ensuring a larger distance is one strategy
to increase the safety margin during TEA
and, of course, during spinal anaesthesia.
A recent report presented a case of segmen-
tal spinal anaesthesia for cholecystectomy in
a patient with severe lung disease.14
The present study demonstrated that the
angle between the `U' and `L' lines was the
largest at the T1/2 level. The larger the angle
is between the `U' and `L' lines, the higher
the flexibility will be regarding the angle of
needle insertion at the interspinous space.
However, the objective difference in DTC
between the `U' and `L' lines was greatest at
the T5/6 level, where the vertical DTC was
longest, indicating that variability in the
safety margin according to the needle inser-
tion angle was the largest at T5/6 and that
the increase in the safety margin was most
significant at the mid-thoracic region. Thus,
the STD and DTC on the `L' line were
longer than those on the `U' line or `M' line
at the T1/2 and T5/6 levels. By contrast, the
STD and DTC were the longest on the `U'
line at the lower thoracic region of T10/11.
Therefore, we speculate that TEA can be
managed more safely by inserting a needle
through a pathway near the lower border of
the interspinous space at the upper or
middle thoracic region and near the upper
border at lower levels than by approaching
from a random direction, as represented by
the `M' line.
The `U' line at the upper or middle
thoracic region and the `L' line at lower
levels might not be the longest pathway
possible in the intervertebral space. For
example, a line that starts from the posterior
part of the lower border to the upper end of
the ligamentum flavum suggests a greater
safety margin than the `L' line. Therefore,
the `U' and `L' lines are not absolute clinical
guides for safety but references that can be
used to understand the anatomy of the
thoracic vertebral spine.
This present study had a number of limita-
tions. First, approximately 9% of all patients
(32 of 346) had `M' lines at the T10/11
intervertebral level that did not pass through
the interspinous space on the MR images. This
was because the lower thoracic spinous pro-
cesses have more variable shapes, and the
midpoint of two adjacent tips can be far
apart from the centre of the posterior inter-
spinous space. In those patients, the `M' line
does not represent a blind approach and is just
an imaginary line. Secondly, all of the data in
this study were measured using supine MR
images. However, most neuraxial blockades
are performed with patients in the lateral
decubitus position with or without leg flexion.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the
spinal cord and cauda equina move with
gravity and also ventrally with leg flexion.7,15,16
Consequently, it is expected that the safety
margin would be greater in a lateral than a
supine position. However, whether the
Park et al. 955
correlation between spinal structure and verte-
bral level would be maintained using a lateral
posture is uncertain. Supplementary studies are
needed to elucidate the effect of various pos-
tures on the thoracic vertebral canal.
In conclusion, there were differences in
the DTC among thoracic intervertebral
levels, the longest being at the T5/6 level
and the shortest at the T11/12 level. By
comparing different approach angles, the
safety margin was found to be the longest on
the `L' line at the T1/2 and T5/6 levels and
the longest on the `U' line at lower thoracic
regions. The variability of the safety margin
according to the angle of needle insertion
was the largest at T5/6. These differences
merit consideration to prevent serious cord
damage in association with TEA.
