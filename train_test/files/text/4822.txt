Abstract
Safe movement through the environment requires us to monitor our surroundings for moving
objects or people. However, identification of moving objects in the scene is complicated by self-
movement, which adds motion across the retina. To identify world-relative object movement, the
brain thus has to `compensate for' or `parse out' the components of retinal motion that are due to
self-movement. We have previously demonstrated that retinal cues arising from central vision
contribute to solving this problem. Here, we investigate the contribution of peripheral vision,
commonly thought to provide strong cues to self-movement. Stationary participants viewed a
large field of view display, with radial flow patterns presented in the periphery, and judged the
trajectory of a centrally presented probe. Across two experiments, we demonstrate and quantify
the contribution of peripheral optic flow to flow parsing during forward and backward movement.

Introduction
The ability to detect and estimate the movement of objects in the surrounding environment is
vital. Without this ability, dangerous activities such as crossing the road would be very
difficult. For a stationary observer, the visual detection of a moving object in an otherwise
stationary scene is straightforward; moving objects in the world are indicated by motion in
the image that is formed on the retina (retinal motion; Figure 1(a)). However, during self-

movement, this task becomes more complex; objects that are stationary in the scene can be
moving within the retinal image (Figure 1(b)) and the physical trajectories of objects that are
moving in the scene are obscured (Figure 1(c)). Thus, during self-movement, the brain must
decompose a complex pattern of retinal motion (Figure 1(c), insert) to separate components
of retinal motion that are due to objects moving in the scene from components of retinal
motion due to self-movement.
A general class of compensation solutions for this problem rests upon the brain generating
a prediction of the sensory signals that should be expected from self-movement and then
comparing this prediction to the actual incoming sensory data (von Holst & Mittlestadt,
1954). In practice, this process can be thought of as subtracting the predicted from the
experienced sensory consequences of the movement. Given an accurate prediction, any
remaining signal after the subtraction must then be due to the motion of other objects in
the scene.
To be able to generate a prediction of expected sensory input, it is clear that information
about current self-movement is required. This could come from either retinal (visual) or
extra-retinal (non-visual) sources or a combination of both. Early investigations of this
problem focused on extra-retinal information about self-movement (von Holst &
Mittlestadt, 1954). Wallach (1987) and Gogel (1990) found that extra-retinal information
about self-movement plays an important role in judgements of object movement. More recent
work by Wexler (van Boxtel, Wexler, & Droulez, 2003; Wexler, Lamouret, & Droulez, 2001;
Wexler, Panerai, Lamouret, & Droulez, 2001), Angelaki, Gu, and DeAngelis (2011;
MacNeilage, Zhang, DeAngelis, & Angelaki, 2012) and Glennerster (Tcheang, Gilson, &
Glennerster, 2005) has extended our understanding of these extra-retinal processes.

Over the last decade, research has begun to focus on how retinal information might also be
used to enable compensation for the consequences of self-movement (Calabro, Soto-Faraco
& Vaina, 2011; Calabro & Vaina, 2011; Fajen & Matthis, 2011; Matsumiya & Ando, 2009;
Royden & Connors, 2010; Rushton, Bradshaw & Warren, 2007; Rushton & Warren, 2005;
Warren & Rushton 2007; Warren & Rushton, 2008; Warren & Rushton, 2009; Royden &
Moore, 2012; Warren, Rushton, & Foulkes, 2012; Fajen & Matthis, 2013; Fajen, Parade, &
Matthis, 2013; Foulkes, Rushton, & Warren, 2013a, b; Royden & Holloway, 2014). When an
observer moves, a characteristic, global, structured pattern of retinal motion arises which
contains information about self-movement (Gibson, 1950). It should be possible to use such
information to underpin a compensation solution.
The flow parsing hypothesis (Rushton & Warren, 2005) suggests that the brain uses
incoming retinal motion to generate a direct prediction of current self-movement and then
does something akin to a global subtraction (or filtering) of the (predicted) optic flow across
the visual field. Considerable data have now been provided which is compatible with the use
of such a visually based process (Rushton & Warren 2005; Rushton et al., 2007; Warren &
Rushton, 2007; Warren & Rushton, 2009; Matsumiya & Ando, 2009; Royden & Connors,
2010; Calabro, Soto-Faraco & Vaina, 2011; Calabro & Vaina, 2011; Fajan & Matthis, 2011;
Royden & Moore, 2012; Foulkes et al., 2013a, b; Fajen & Matthis, 2013; Fajen et al., 2013;
Royden & Holloway, 2014). For example, Warren and Rushton (2009) show that when the
left hemifield of an expanding radial optic flow stimulus is presented together with a probe
object in the right hemifield, the perceived probe trajectory is biased. The direction of the bias
is consistent with subtraction of the (absent) right hemifield of optic flow. Furthermore, the
bias increases in size as the probe moves further into the empty hemifield--a difficult result to
explain with an alternative account given that it suggests more interaction between two
stimuli as they move further apart. However, this surprising result is predicted by flow
parsing; motion in a radial flow field generally increases in magnitude with eccentricity,
meaning the component to be subtracted (and hence the effect on the probe) should also
increase with eccentricity. Recent work has also focused on developing models of the neural
processes underlying flow parsing (e.g., Layton & Fajen, 2016; Royden & Holloway 2014;
Royden, Sannicandro, & Webber, 2015).
Work on flow parsing to date has presented optic flow stimuli in central vision. However,
peripheral vision is also known to make powerful contributions to both the perception of self-
movement (Brandt, Dichgans, and Koenig, 1973; Berthoz, Pavard, & Young, 1975; Habak,
Casanova, & Faubert, 2002; Lepecq, Jouen, & Dubon, 1993) and its control (Lee & Aronson,
1974; Bardy, Warren & Kay, 1999; Erikson & von Hofsten, 2005; Stoffregen, 1985).
Furthermore, peripheral flow has a potential role in resolving some of the ambiguities in
visual information present in central vision. For example, assuming noise in the coding of
motion signals, the retinal flow associated with lateral translation is similar to that generated
during a horizontal gaze rotation. There is no similar ambiguity with peripheral flow because
gaze rotation and lateral translation generate quite different patterns of retinal motion.
Lateral translation produces a radial flow pattern on either side of the observer, a
contracting field on one side and an expanding field on the other, whereas gaze rotation
produces laminar flow on both sides. Here, we assess the contribution of peripheral visual
information to flow parsing during simulated forward and backward movement. Although
forward movement is likely to be more common in everyday activity, we also included a
backward self-movement condition for comparison.
Several different definitions of what constitutes peripheral vision and what constitutes
central vision have been used previously. For example, Osaka (1994, as cited in Berencsi,
Ishihara, & Imanaka, 2005) assessed the distribution of cones and rods across the retina and
Rogers et al. 3
defined the central 2 to 4 of vision as `central' with everything beyond classed as peripheral
vision. Trevarthen (1968) classified peripheral vision as beyond the central 4 to 5 of vision.
However, the majority of experimental studies consider central vision to cover a much larger
portion of the retina, typically extending up to 15 from fixation (a 30 region in the centre of
vision, see Brandt et al., 1973; Paulus, Straube, & Brandt, 1984; Post, 1988). For the purpose
of our research, we used the latter definition and defined central vision as up to 15 from
fixation.
Overview of Experiments
In two experiments, we assessed the impact of optic flow presented in the periphery on the
perceived trajectory of a target probe in central vision. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the
eccentricity of the peripheral visual flow and found evidence for an effect on target trajectory
(and hence a peripheral contribution to flow parsing) for flow stimuli up to 41 from fixation.
The contribution of peripheral vision to flow parsing was found to decrease approximately
linearly as a function of retinal eccentricity. In Experiment 2, we examined how information
from different locations across the peripheral retina is combined. Our data suggest that the
information from the most central part of the peripheral retina makes the primary
contribution to the combined effect.
Experiment 1
Flow parsing involves the subtraction of global components of motion. If a global
component of motion is subtracted then every object in the visual field should be affected.
To recap, Warren and Rushton (2009) looked for evidence of the subtraction process by
probing empty locations within the visual stimulus. In a key condition, they placed the probe
dot opposite a hemifield of radial flow that had a focus of expansion at the point of fixation.
They found that the perceived trajectory of the probe dot was influenced by the presence of
the flow (and the change showed a dependence on the position of the relative to the focus of
expansion). The difference between physical and perceived trajectory was consistent with a
global flow subtraction process.
Warren and Rushton (2009) demonstrated the contribution of central vision to the parsing
process. Here, we created a variant of Warren and Rushton (2009) to investigate if peripheral
vision contributes, and if so, which parts of the periphery contribute. Expanding or
contracting radial flow was presented at different eccentricities whilst a horizontally
moving target appeared either above or below a central fixation point, as depicted in
Figure 2.
If peripheral vision contributes to the flow parsing process, then the perceived trajectory of
the target dot will be biased inwards in the presence of expanding radial flow (see Figure 2) or
outwards in the case of contracting radial flow. By varying the eccentricity of the radial flow,
we can assess the extent to which the effects of peripheral flow persist.
All targets moved across the screen from left to right, perceived trajectories are expressed
in terms of a positive or a negative trajectory bias, where positive is anticlockwise (ACW; i.e.,
Figure 2(c), the target below fixation shows an ACW bias which would be coded as a positive
relative tilt, and the target above fixation shows a clockwise [CW] bias, coded as a negative
relative tilt). We summarise the results using the difference in relative tilt between the two
target positions (see Supplementary Materials for detailed results at each flow eccentricity).
We will look for evidence of a change in the relative tilt difference as a function of flow
eccentricity. To do this, we conducted a two-factor ANOVA for each eccentricity condition

with direction of radial flow (forwards or backwards) and target position (above or below) as
factors. A significant contribution at each eccentricity would be indicated by a statistical
interaction between target position and the direction of radial motion.
Methods
Participants. Six postgraduate students (1 male) with an age range of 22 to 26 took part in the
study and were naiÂ¨ve as to the experimental hypotheses. Participants were recruited from the
School of Psychology, Cardiff University, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Where vision was corrected, participants were asked to wear contact lenses. This additional
restriction was put in place because the frames of a participant's glasses might have obscured
(at least partially) the peripheral stimuli used in the experiments.
All recruitment and experimental procedures reported herein adhered to the Declaration
of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology, Cardiff
University.
Apparatus. Computer-generated visual stimuli were presented on a large nonpolarising back
projection screen using a ChristieT Digital Systems Projector (model DSÃ¾26). The spatial
resolution of the display was 1400 Ã 1050 with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The projected image
size was 127 cm Ã 96 cm. When viewed at a distance of 40 cm, the projection area subtended
116 Ã 100 and had a resolution of 12 pixels/degree.
All experiments were coded in Pascal and OpenGL using Lazarus (an open source IDE),
SDL v1.2 (https://www.libsdl.org) and the JEDI-SDL libraries (http://www.delphi-jedi.org).
Stimuli were rendered on a computer running Windows XP with a NVIDIA Quadro NVS
420 Graphics card with four DVI outputs (driving two projectors and two peripheral
monitors). All stimuli were drawn in red and presented on a black background unless

otherwise stated. A red filter was placed in front of the projector to improve the contrast of
the display. Anti-aliasing was set to 2 Ã multisample antialiasing in order to ensure smooth
motion of the stimuli at such a close viewing distance. For trajectory judgements, participants
used a physical `jog-wheel' (a rotating dial) to orient an on-screen response line to match the
trajectory they perceived.
Stimuli. Radial flow was presented on the projection screen and simulated forward or
backward translation. The flow stimulus consisted of 3,500 red limited lifetime dots
(1 second lifetime, 0.6 diameter). Dot motion was appropriate for an observer translating
either forward or backward at a rate of 30 cm/s (a slow walking pace) through a volume of
5.33 m Ã 5.33 m Ã 10 m that was centred 133 cm in front of the observer. When a dot moved
offscreen or had been present for more than 1 s, it was redrawn at a new on-screen location at
the end of the volume, ahead of the observer. Dots were presented in an annulus (peripheral
band). Dot lifetime was staggered so that dots disappeared and reappeared asynchronously.
Approximately 600 dots were visible at any one time.
Five inner annulus radii (r, see Figure 3(b)) were used, visual angles of 23, 27, 32, 37
and 41 (16.8, 20, 25, 30, 35 cm in on-screen dimensions, as presented in results). The annulus
width (w, see Figure 3(b)) was 14 at a radius of 23. The annulus width increased with
annulus radius, it was M-scaled for eccentricity using the method described by Rousselet,
Husk, Bennett, and Sekuler (2005; see Supplementary Materials).
A central fixation dot was presented at the centre of the flow stimulus together with a small
(0.3) circular red target probe placed either above or below fixation at 4 eccentricity. Target
motion was predominantly horizontal and rightwards (although see below) at 0.6/s. All
targets appeared to the left hand side of the midline and translated rightward along the
specified trajectory. The target passed through the vertical midline of the screen half way
along its travelled path.
Design. Three independent variables were manipulated: the direction of simulated self-
movement (2 levels: expanding or contracting flow), the position of the target (2 levels:
Ã4/Ã¾4 from fixation) and the eccentricity of the peripheral flow (measured by the inner
annulus radius [r], 5 levels: 23, 27, 32, 37 and 41).
To avoid potential response biases, rather than repeatedly presenting the same trajectory,
the target had a fixed initial position and the trajectory varied within a range above and
below horizontal. This manipulation prevented the observer from knowing whether perceived
upwards motion was physical or due to flow parsing on any given trial. In each condition,
there were nine physical target trajectories (spanning the range Ã 32 from horizontal in 8
steps), resulting in a total of 180 trials (2 Ã 2 Ã 5 Ã 9), which were all completed in a single
experimental session of approximately 45 min. The order of the trials was randomised and all
eccentricity conditions were interleaved.
The dependent variable was relative tilt, which was calculated as the difference between the
on-screen trajectory and perceived trajectory reported by the observer. A within-subjects
design was used and data collection for each participant was completed in a single
experimental session.
Procedure. Observers were seated on a static height-adjustable chair, in a dark room with their
eyes level with the fixation point and approximately 40 cm viewing distance from the centre of
the projection screen. It was not feasible to provide participants with a chin rest at this
viewing distance but participants (who had all taken part in previous psychophysical
experiments) were instructed to keep as still as possible during the experiment.

The timeline of each trial, depicted in Figure 4, was as follows: A fixation dot was
presented. Participants maintained fixation on the central dot throughout each trial. After
0.75 s, peripheral flow appeared which simulated forward or backward translation at a speed
of 30 cm/s. Following a variable 1 to 1.2 s delay, the target was presented above or below
fixation and moved at constant speed of 0.6/s (1 cm/s) for a 2-s duration. Immediately after
the probe disappeared, a short 2D response line ($3 in length) which rotated about the point
at which the target initially appeared was presented with a randomised initial line orientation
on each trial. Participants rotated the line using a rotating dial or `jog-wheel' in order to
indicate the perceived trajectory of the target. Participants were told that if they did not
perceive the target to move along a straight path, then they should set the response line to
match the mean linear trajectory of the target. Once the participant had set the on-screen line,
they clicked a button on the jog-wheel to move on to the next trial. By delaying their click,
observers could opt to take a break before continuing. Four enforced breaks of 15 s duration
were imposed at regular intervals during the experiment.

only the projection screen was used and the observer was seated, with a viewing distance of 40 cm. In

The observer is seated with head in chinrest (green diamond) looking straight ahead. In Experiment 2, the

Experiment 1 and Experiment S1 (control, see Supplementary Materials) used only the central projection

to present flow stimuli. Experiment 1 dashed line (r) shows inner annulus radius and solid line (w) indicates
flow width.

Analysis. To equate relative tilts across the different target trajectories, a simple
transformation was applied to the raw data1 (see Warren & Rushton, 2007, for further
details):
iÂ¼ tanÃ1Ã°sinÃ°p
ÃRÃ=sinpÃ
where the P and R subscripts refer to perceived and real on-screen trajectory angles. In the
results that follow, i
is referred to as the relative tilt.
To present appropriate within-subject error bars in figures, the data were normalised
according to the method described in Cousineau (2005). Variance due to individual
differences was removed from the dataset by subtracting each participant's average relative
tilt from the same participant's relative tilt in each experimental condition. Using the adjusted
dataset, the standard error was then calculated for each condition.
Under this experimental design, flow parsing predicts that changing either the target
position or flow movement direction should lead to reversals in the sign of the relative tilt
in an unbiased observer. The combination of the two effects means that we should find a
statistical interaction between target position and flow direction. Accordingly, we conducted
a 2 Ã 2 repeated measures ANOVA at each flow eccentricity and looked for a simple
interaction between the flow direction and target position as a marker of flow parsing
(rather than insisting on a sign change). The presence of an interaction provides statistical
support for a contribution to flow parsing at the eccentricity considered. Since a directional
interaction was predicted, probability values from the ANOVA interaction term were
adjusted (p/2; Wuensch, 2006), because the error term for the interaction in an ANOVA
does not assume a directional effect. Note that the test for an interaction is robust in the case
of observers who have a systematic tendency to perceive, or report, a trajectory inaccurately.
In addition to looking for evidence of flow parsing at each flow eccentricity, we looked to
see if the magnitude of the flow parsing effect (relative tilt) increased (or decreased) as a

function of the eccentricity of the radial flow. We conducted this analysis on the difference of
the relative tilt between the above and below target positions, which essentially provides an
index of the magnitude of the flow parsing effects observed across the two probe positions
and has the added advantage of doubling the size of the effect. A 5 (flow eccentricity) Ã 2
(flow direction) within-subjects ANOVA was then performed. If flow parsing effects
decreased as a function of flow eccentricity, then we would expect to see an interaction
between these two factors.
Results and Discussion
We found that the presence of expanding or contracting visual flow in peripheral vision
biased the perceived trajectory of a central target. At each tested flow eccentricity and
target position, perceived target trajectory was biased in the direction opposite to the
flow--indicative of global subtraction and in line with a peripheral contribution to flow
parsing.
For targets located below fixation (Ã4), target trajectory was ACW during expanding flow
and CW during contracting flow. When the target was located above fixation (Ã¾4), we
observed the opposite pattern with expanding flow biasing target trajectory in a CW
direction and contracting flow resulting in an ACW bias. This pattern of results indicates
a contribution of peripheral flow to a flow parsing mechanism and was statistically significant
(interaction, all p < .01) at each flow eccentricity (Figure 5; see Supplementary Materials for
full statistical results).
There was also a significant interaction between flow eccentricity and flow direction,
F(4, 20) Â¼ 7.891, p < .001, the magnitude of the effect differed as a function of the direction
of the flow and the eccentricity of the flow. This interaction which is evident in Figure 6
indicates that relative tilt difference decreases with increasing flow eccentricity.
We also found that relative tilt effects were larger in the expanding flow conditions
(Figure 6). The magnitude of the difference in relative tilt between the two target positions
was significantly larger for expanding flow than contracting flow, F(1, 5) Â¼ 265.332, p < .001.
The marked difference between expanding and contracting flow is evident in this figure. This
difference might indicate a response bias, and the similar gradient of the two lines is
compatible with this. However, asymmetries between expanding and contracting flow have
been reported before (e.g., Edwards & Ibbotson, 2007, showed faster onset and larger
magnitude of vection in response to contracting flow than expanding flow but there is
some debate in this area and other studies have demonstrated a greater response to
expanding flow, i.e., Reinhardt-Rutland, 1982). The differences observed in this experiment
between expanding and contracting flow might be due to broader differences in the neural
processing of expanding and contracting motion. As forward self-movement is typically
faster than backward self-movement, there may well be differences in the speed tuning of
neurons in relation to these two directions of motion. The second control experiment
(Experiment S2) provides some data on the sensitivity to motion between forward and
backward self-movement using the present flow stimuli. The results of S2 did not indicate
any differences in sensitivity.
Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 show that peripheral flow contributes to flow parsing but that the
contribution decreases as the eccentricity of flow increases. However, we were only able to
explore the contribution over a limited range of eccentricities. In Experiment 2, we explore
Rogers et al. 9
further into the periphery and examine how information from different parts of the peripheral
retina is combined. To do this, we defined near (15Â­45 from fixation) and far (45Â­135 from
fixation) peripheral regions. To stimulate far periphery, we placed monitors to either side of the
participant's head. This setup was inspired by the peripheral vection experiments in Lepecq
et al. (1993) which used moving striped vertical bar stimuli presented on similarly arranged
screens. This experimental setup was reported to create a compelling sense of vection and
therefore should provide a strong visual cue to self-movement in this experiment.

Target movement parameters and the relative tilt measure of perceived target trajectory
were the same as in Experiment 1. As in Experiment 1, the contribution of peripheral motion
to flow parsing would be indicated by a significant interaction between flow direction and
target position.
Methods
Participants. Five undergraduate students (2 male) with an age range of 18 to 21 were recruited
using an online participant panel and received course credit. The same eligibility restrictions
and ethical procedures as for Experiment 1 were applied. All participants were naiÂ¨ve to the
experimental hypotheses.
Apparatus. The central projection screen apparatus was the same as that used in
Experiment 1, but we used an increased viewing distance of 95 cm. At this distance, the
projected image size was 67.5 Ã 53.6 and there were 21 pixels/degree. In addition, two
1900 (aspect ratio 5:4) BENQ LCD monitors (model number: Q9T4) with a resolution of
1280 Ã 1050 were placed either side of the observer's head, in a portrait orientation (see
Figure 3(a)). The monitors faced each other and were separated by a total distance of
43 cm with the chinrest for observers centred between the two monitors. Thus, each
monitor was approximately 15 cm from the observer's nearest eye. Each monitor
subtended approximately 90 horizontally and 100 vertically. For an observer seated with
their head in the chin rest and looking straight ahead, the front edge of each peripheral
display (monitor screen) was 45 from the (cyclopean) line of sight (see Figure 3). The
monitors at the side of the head were covered with a red lighting gel to increase the
contrast of the stimuli and reduce ambient light which might have otherwise increased the
saliency of the edges of the monitors. Note that the arrangement of the apparatus meant that
there were gaps between the vertical edges of the central and peripheral screens.

Stimuli. As depicted in Figure 3 (right hand side), three peripheral flow conditions (Near, Far
and Combined) were employed. The Near peripheral flow was generated using the same
method as reported for Experiment 1 and had an inner radius (r) of 40 cm (22.8) and an
outer radius of 50 cm (27.8) which was a similar eccentricity to inner edge of the least
peripheral stimuli presented in Experiment 1 (inner radius [r] of 23). Far peripheral flow
was presented on monitors either side of the head. Stripes were used in the periphery
similar to Lepecq et al.'s (1993) stimuli and because pilot testing demonstrated this stimulus
gave a more compelling sense of self-movement than the limited lifetime dots that were used in
central vision. Vertical stripes were positioned at a virtual distance of 50 cm from the
observer's nose on two parallel planes, either side of the head and orthogonal to the fronto-
parallel plane and moved parallel to the line of sight away from the central projection screen.
The Combined flow condition presented the Near and Far peripheral stimuli simultaneously.
As before, the target was a small circular dot (diameter: 0.12) positioned either above or
below fixation at an eccentricity of 4 from fixation and moved rightwards at a speed of
0.6/s. The diameter of the flow dots, target size, fixation dot size and target position were all
scaled in accordance with the increased viewing distance (95 cm vs. 40 cm).
Design. We manipulated three variables in this experiment: target position (Ã4/Ã¾4), flow
direction (expanding/contracting) and peripheral region (Near/Far/Combined). For each of
the 12 resulting conditions, the nine tilt trajectories we employed in the previous experiment
were presented twice. Near, Far and Combined conditions were presented in separate blocks
consisting of 72 trials each. As before, we measured the relative tilt in degrees. All
participants saw all conditions and the order of peripheral conditions was counterbalanced
across participants. Each participant completed the three peripheral conditions in a single
experimental session lasting approximately 45 min.
Procedure. Participants were seated with their head in a chinrest and instructed to maintain
fixation on the dot in the centre of the screen during stimulus presentation. The trial
procedure timings were identical to Experiment 1 (see Figure 4) and the Near, Far or
Combined peripheral flow conditions were presented in separate experimental blocks.
A 15-s enforced break was included halfway through each block. Because there were more
trials in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, in order to reduce eyestrain and minimise fatigue,
the ceiling lights were turned on and participants had a short ($2 min) break between each
peripheral condition (Near/Far/Combined).
Analysis. As before, to assess whether peripheral flow contributes to flow parsing, we
conducted a 2 (expanding/contracting flow) Ã 2 (Ã4/Ã¾4 target position) repeated measures
ANOVA on the data from each peripheral condition.
To investigate how information from Near and Far periphery is combined, we compared
the magnitude of the effect in the Combined condition to the sum of the magnitude of Near
and Far effects. Specifically, we conducted a regression analysis to evaluate how well the
Combined condition data could be predicted from the linear sum of near and far data.
Results and Discussion
The results corroborated the findings of Experiment 1, they showed a peripheral contribution to
flow parsing when flow was presented in near peripheral vision (Figure 7, left panel). The
interaction between flow direction and target position was highly significant, F(1, 4) Â¼
185.351, p < .001. In the Far peripheral condition (central panel, Figure 7), the magnitude of
12 i-Perception
relative tilt observed was much lower than in the Near condition. Additionally, the effect of
Flow direction and target position upon relative tilt was less pronounced, but a significant
interaction was still present, F(1, 4) Â¼ 6.544, p Â¼ .0315. The data in the Combined condition
(Figure 7, right panel) looked rather similar to the Near condition and once again a significant
interaction between flow direction and target position was observed, F(1, 4) Â¼ 68.249, p Â¼ .005.
For each flow direction (expanding or contracting), a linear regression analyses was
conducted to test the extent to which the relative tilt data in the Combined condition
could be predicted by the linear sum (Near Ã¾ Far) data. For the expanding flow
condition, statistical testing showed the linear sum model accounted for 97% of the
variance in the Combined data,  Â¼ 0.788, R2 Â¼ .971, F(1, 8) Â¼ 269.838, p < .001. For
Contracting flow, the linear sum model accounted for only 34% of the variance in the
Combined data,  Â¼ 0.817, R2 Â¼ .343, F(1, 8) Â¼ 4.170, p Â¼ .075, n.s. Taken together, these
results suggest that the contribution of far peripheral flow to flow parsing is limited. There
is some indication that the linear sum model can account for the data in the expanding but
not the contracting flow conditions. Rather than suggesting that the brain does not combine
information over the retina, it is likely that the result in the Contracting condition is due to
the small magnitude of the effect of far peripheral flow on perceived probe trajectory.
Contribution of Far periphery
Given the linear relationship between eccentricity and the magnitude of the flow parsing
effect in Experiment 1, we can attempt to predict the amount of relative tilt that is
expected for the Far peripheral condition. Before doing so, however, we note an important
caveat: Image speed depends on both distance from the observer and self-movement speed.
The ability to factor out the effect of distance depends on the quality of the distance cues
available. Distance cues are typically plentiful in central vision but drop off in peripheral
vision. Consequently, for the far peripheral stimuli, the magnitude of any flow parsing is
probably based on raw image speed alone. Had we placed the virtual bars closer, the image
speed would have been higher; had we placed them further, then the image speeds would have
been lower. Therefore, the magnitude of the flow parsing effect we observe with far periphery
alone is relatively arbitrary. With that caveat clearly stated, we looked at the observed
magnitude of the flow parsing effect in far periphery and the magnitude predicted from an
extrapolation of the results observed for central and near peripheral regions in Experiment 1.

The nearest edge of the far peripheral stimulus was 45 from fixation and the flow was
presented only on the left and right of the head. We fitted a regression model to the data from
Experiment 1 and used the model to predict relative tilt difference for a case where flow was
presented at 45 eccentricity. The composite data and predictions are shown in Figure 8.
The prediction on the basis of the data from Experiment 1 for flow presented at 45
eccentricity is broadly in line with the data collected from the Far condition of
Experiment 2. In the following section, we consider some additional factors that could
impact on the flow parsing effects observed.
Further Influences on the Magnitude of the Flow-Parsing Effect, Supplemental
Experiments
In further supplementary experiments, we investigated the effect of further stimulus
parameters. In Supplementary Experiment S1, we investigated whether reducing the area of
the flow, specifically whether presenting flow only in two quadrants (as in Experiment 2),
impacted upon the magnitude of flow parsing. The results of the experiment indicated that
the presence of flow stimuli on only the left and right quadrants did lead to a reduction in
relative tilt difference compared with when stimuli were presented in all four quadrants of the
visual field. Specifically, we found that the relative tilt for expanding flow reduced by 34% and
for contracting flow by 49%. Nonetheless, even with the removal of half of the area of the
visual field (the above and below quadrants), the overall pattern of results was similar in this
supplementary experiment.
In supplementary Experiment S2, we investigated the impact of stimulus type and peripheral
position between Experiments 1 and 2 (near peripheral dots vs. far peripheral stripes), whether
the two stimuli provided equally good motion signals. We did this by comparing speed
discrimination thresholds. We found no effects of stimulus type on speed discrimination.
In sum, across Experiments 1 and 2, we find that peripheral flow does contribute to flow
parsing but the contribution decreases with eccentricity. This reduction appears to follow a
linear function. We find no compelling evidence that flow presented beyond 40 eccentricity
makes a significant contribution to flow parsing.

Discussion
We set out to investigate whether optic flow presented in the periphery could contribute to
the flow parsing process during simulated forward and backward movements of the observer.
The experiments reported here demonstrate that peripheral visual flow can contribute to flow
parsing. When self-movement information is presented in peripheral vision, it leads to a
systematic effect on perceived object trajectory in line with the flow parsing account.
Experiment 1 showed that the magnitude of the effect on perceived object trajectory
decreases as peripheral flow becomes more eccentric. Experiment 2 compared the
contributions of flow in the Near and Far periphery and how these contributions might be
combined. The results extended the findings of the first experiment, and again showed that
the contribution of peripheral flow to flow parsing decreases with increasing retinal
eccentricity. We examined how flow from different portions of the periphery was
combined. We found some evidence for combination across regions; however, the fact that
we found greatly reduced effects when flow was in far periphery makes it hard to draw a
strong conclusion from these data.
In our experiments, we ask observers to maintain fixation at the focus of the flow field.
Studies have shown that this is the location that observers typically fixate (Land & Lee, 1994;
Lappe, Pekel, & Hoffmann, 1998, 1999; Mourant, Rockwell, & Rackoff, 1969; Niemann,
Lappe, Bu
Â¨ scher, & Hoffmann, 1999). Because observers are looking at the focus of the flow
field, retinal eccentricity and eccentricity defined relative to the focus of the flow field are
equivalent. Consequently, we cannot distinguish between the two. If an observer fixates a
point away from the focus, the difference between eccentricity relative to the fovea and
eccentricity relative to the flow field becomes important. Research has shown that ability
to judge direction of heading is relatively independent of the eccentricity of the focus of
expansion (Crowell & Banks, 1993). Therefore, we would expect little difference in the
flow-parsing process. However, further experimental work is needed to confirm this
prediction.
We now consider potential explanations for the decreased contribution to flow parsing of
peripheral retina. Flow parsing relies on an accurate estimate of self-movement direction. In
addition, retinal image speed is a function of both the speed at which the observer is
translating and the distance of the scene objects from the observer so the availability of
these cues is important for flow parsing. In central vision, the availability of binocularly
overlapping visual fields and high acuity allow for precise estimates of the distance that is
necessary for accurate estimation of observer translation speed. As the eccentricity increases,
raw image speed persists but the available information about distance decreases,
so consequently, the precision of estimates of self-movement speed will also decrease. The
decrease in the precision of estimates of self-movement direction or self-movement speed
should lead to the down-weighting of flow with eccentricity in the flow parsing process.
The research reported here provides a foundation for exploring the potential contribution
of peripheral vision to flow parsing for other forms of self-movement. The case of lateral self-
movement will be of particular interest as the peripheral flow structure unambiguously
specifies that the observer is undergoing lateral translation. This differs from central vision
where the flow due to lateral translation is difficult to distinguish from the flow due to a gaze
rotation around the vertical axis. Therefore, in the case of lateral translation, we would
expect a clear contribution of peripheral vision to flow parsing.
In summary, the experiments reported here show a clear contribution of peripheral visual
motion to the flow parsing process and further bolsters the evidence that this mechanism
relies upon global optic flow fields.
