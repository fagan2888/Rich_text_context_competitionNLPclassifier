Abstract
Objectives: Chronic gneck and shoulder pain (CNSP) is a common clinical symptom of cervical
spondylotic radiculopathy. Several studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (rs-fMRI) have reported that most chronic pain diseases are accompanied by structural and
functional changes in the brain. However, few rs-fMRI studies have examined CNSP. The current
study investigated cerebral structural and functional changes in CNSP patients.
Methods: In total, 25 CNSP patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. 3D-T1W
and rs-fMRI images were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was applied to structural
images, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) was extracted from rs-fMRI. Statistical analysis was
performed on post-processing images and ReHo parameter maps.
Results: The results revealed no significant differences in brain structure between the two groups.
In the patient group, ReHo values were significantly increased in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus
and decreased in the left insula, superior frontal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, supplementary
motor area, right postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobule.
Conclusions: This initial structural and rs-fMRI study of CNSP revealed characteristic features of
spontaneous brain activity of CNSP patients. These findings may be helpful for increasing our
understanding of the neuropathology of CNSP.

Introduction
Chronic neck and shoulder pain (CNSP)
is a common clinical symptom of cervical
spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR).1 Clinical
evidence has demonstrated that patients
with long-duration chronic pain may
develop accumulating brain damage due to
the repetitive occurrence of pain-related
processes2 accompanied by dysfunction of
sensory, cognitive, memory and affective
processing.3­5 A number of studies have
been conducted to investigate the underlying
cerebral changes caused by chronic pain,
including changes in neuroplasticity, neuro-
chemistry, electrophysiology, brain struc-
ture and function.6­10 Most functional
imaging studies observing major abnormal-
ities in patients with chronic pain of various
aetiologies reporting have reported changes
in brain structure, aberrant spontaneous
neural activity and disturbed functional
connectivity related to pain.6,7,10­13
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) stu-
dies of other chronic pain conditions have
reported reduced grey matter in specific
brain regions.6,7,12 Thus, the current study
explored changes in brain structure using
VBM methodology.
Resting-state functional magnetic reson-
ance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been found
to be an effective approach to evaluate
spontaneous neural activity based on blood
oxygen level-dependent contrast.14 In the
last decade, a number of studies have used
rs-fMRI to investigate changes in neural
activity caused by different chronic pain
sources, including migraine, somatoform
pain, low back pain, visceral pain and
fibromyalgia.15­19 Regional homogeneity
(ReHo) is an important parameter that can
be extracted from rs-fMRI data sets.20
ReHo was first proposed by Zang YF and
colleagues, suggesting that ReHo exhibits
superior performance compared with
model-driven methods, due to its sensitivity
in the detection of unpredicted and complex
spontaneous hemodynamic responses in
human brain function.21,22 In addition,
ReHo has been used to investigate the
regional activity characteristics of each
voxel within the brain, which was not pos-
sible with earlier methods.2 Moreover, the
high test-retest reliability of ReHo has been
confirmed by carefully optimizing the data,
preprocessing and computational imple-
mentation.23 These benefits have prompted
the wide application of ReHo for discover-
ing changes in brain function under pain
conditions. Specific alterations of ReHo
values have been identified for the various
types of chronic pain.15,17,20 Wang et al.20
reported that patients with tension-type
headache exhibited significantly lower
ReHo values in the bilateral caudate
nucleus, precuneus, putamen, left middle
frontal gyrus (MFG) and superior frontal
gyrus (SFG) and that these regions were
involved in the integration and processing of
pain. Another study of migraine without
aura reported a significant decrease in the
ReHo values in the right anterior cingulate
cortex, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal
cortex and supplementary motor area
(SMA).15 In a study of experimentally-
induced low back pain, Zhang et al.17 sug-
gested that brain regions exhibiting abnor-
mal ReHo values were potentially associated
with pain processing. These results con-
firmed the diagnostic validity of ReHo for
neuropsychiatric disorders in the field of
chronic pain. Taken together, these findings
Yu et al. 183
indicate that ReHo can be considered a
reliable and effective measure for investigat-
ing and characterizing spontaneous brain
activity, providing valuable information for
understanding the neural mechanisms of
CNSP.
Although many rs-fMRI studies have
investigated the relationships between
changes in ReHo values and different types
of chronic pain, few have focused on CNSP,
which is a subtype of clinical chronic pain.
Based on previous evidence, we hypothe-
sized that CNSP patients would exhibit
changes in brain structure and ReHo. We
tested this hypothesis by exploring struc-
tural changes using VBM, and investigating
the characteristics of spontaneous brain
activity of patients with CNSP using ReHo.
Patients and methods
Participants
In total, 25 patients with CNSP caused
by CSR and 20 sex-, age- and education-
matched healthy volunteers with no neuro-
logical or pain disorders were included in
this study.
The inclusion criteria for the CNSP
group were as follows: (1) CNSP persisted
for more than 3 months and involvement of
the nerve root was found with MRI or CT
(several patients with severe pain and a high
VAS scoreexhibited weakness and difficulty
moving their upper limbs); (2) positive
findings of pain-related symptoms in a
physical examination, including tenderness,
nerve root traction and foraminal compres-
sion; (3) no history of neurological or psy-
chiatric disorders or cognitive dysfunction;
(4) no accompanying pain in other parts of
the body, or CNSP caused by other causes
(e.g., frozen shoulder or muscle strain); and
(5) no other treatment was administered
(i.e., drugs or acupuncture) that could
potentially affect neurological function.
All included subjects provided written
informed consent prior to the acquisition
of MR images, and the study was approved
by the Medical Research Ethics Committee
of Yichang Central People's Hospital
(Yichang, China).
Data acquisition
MRI data acquisition was performed using a
3.0-Tesla scanner (Philips Intera Achieva,
Best, Netherlands). Headphones and foam
pads were used to reduce noise interference
and minimize head motion. Participants
were instructed to lie still in a relaxed
position with their eyes closed, while
remaining awake and avoiding any specific
thoughts. Functional images were acquired
using an echo planar imaging sequence
(TR ¼ 2000 ms, TE ¼ 35 ms, voxel size ¼

64 Â 64 Â 64, FOV ¼ 24 Â 24 cm2; 230
frames were obtained, including the first 12
dummy scans).Three-dimensional T1-weighted

TE¼ 5ms, FA¼ 20, slice thickness¼ 1mm,
FOV¼ 24Â 24cm2, matrix size¼ 256Â 256,
voxel size¼ 1Â 1Â1mm3).
Data preprocessing
The structural and rs-fMRI images
were preprocessed using Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM8, http://www.
restfmri.net/forum/SPM) and Data
Processing Assistant for Resting-State
fMRI (DPARSF, http://www.restfmri.net/
forum/DPARSF), respectively.
For structural images, manual correction
was used if realignments with head move-
ments were more than 2 mm in translation
and 2 in rotation. Brain tissue types were
segmented into gray matter (GM), white
matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) in native space, and modulation was
performed. The resulting gray matter volume
(GMV) images were normalized to Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space
and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian
kernel. For rs-fMRI images, the first 20 time
points (including the first 12 dummy scans)
were removed; and then slice timing was done
due to scan with an interval technique.
Realignments with head movements were
less than 2 mm in translation and 2 in rota-
tion. Functional images were normalized to
MNI standard space using the echo planar
imaging (EPI) template, and resampled
to 3 Â 3 Â 3 mm3. The linear trend of
the signals was removed, and a filter with a
frequency range of 0.01­0.08 Hz was applied.
ReHo analyses
ReHo was computed based on the KCC of
the time series of the voxel and its nearest
neighbours (26 voxels) using DPARSF, fol-
lowed by a smoothing procedure with a
Gaussian kernel with a full-width-half-max-
imum (FWHM) of 4 mm to minimize the
noise and residual differences of the prepro-
cessed images.
Statistical analysis
Independent two-sample t-tests were used
to compare the continuous demographic
variables, and chi-square tests were used to
examine the proportions between groups
with SPSS 13.0. One-sample t-tests were
performed on the individual ReHo maps
for each group using REST Statistical
Analysis software to explore within-group
ReHo characteristics. Two-sample t-tests
were applied to examine differences in the
ReHo values and GMV between the
patient and control groups. Age, sex, and
education levels were analysed as
covariates.
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
The demographic characteristics of all par-
ticipants are shown in Table 1. There were
no significant differences in demographic
variables between the two groups (p > 0.05).
Results
VBM results
Independent two-sample t-tests revealed no
significant differences in GMV between the
CNSP and control groups (p < 0.05).
Within-group ReHo maps
Figure 1 shows the ReHo maps of the CNSP
and control groups. In both groups, standar-
dized ReHo values in the posterior cingulate
cortex, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule,
and medial prefrontal cortex were signifi-
cantly higher than the mean global (whole-
brain) values. The ReHo patterns were
Yu et al. 185
similar to those of the human default mode
network (DMN).
Group differences in ReHo
As seen in the ReHo maps in Figure 2, the
analysis revealed significant differences in
brain activity between the CNSP and con-
trol groups (p < 0.01; AlphaSim correction,
cluster threshold ! 18). The results showed
significantly decreased ReHo values in the
left insula, SFG, middle cingulate gyrus
(MCG), SMA and right postcentral gyrus
(PCG) and superior parietal lobule (SPL).
In contrast, significantly increased ReHo
values were mainly found in the bilateral
MFG (See Table 2 for a detailed list of all
regions exhibiting increased ReHo values).
Discussion
The current study was a preliminary inves-
tigation of alterations in brain structure and
function in patients with CNSP using VBM
and ReHo analysis, respectively. We found
that VBM of T1-weighted anatomical
images revealed no significant structural
changes in GMV in CNSP patients.
However, the analysis demonstrated alter-
ations of regional brain spontaneous activity
in specific brain areas.
VBM analyses
A number of previous studies using VBM
have reported that various types of long-
term chronic pain can lead to a reduction of
GMV in pain processing areas.11,12,24,25
In contrast to previous reports, the current
findings revealed no decrease in GMV. To
investigate this discrepancy, in future studies
we will refine the CNSP patient groups
according to clinical information, including
patient's age, pain duration, attack fre-
quency, and pain intensity, and analyse
changes in brain structure for each group.
Several previous studies have reported that
alterations in brain GMV caused by chronic
pain can be reversible.26,27 Recent studies
have suggested that chronic pain is more

likely to cause network dysfunction, rather
than structural abnormalities.28 Therefore,
more research attention should be focused
on brain functional changes in patients with
chronic pain.
Within-group ReHo maps
To identify the reliability of the functional
analysis using ReHo, one sample t-tests were
performed within the patient and control
groups. The results revealed that ReHo
values in the posterior cingulate cortex,
precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and
medial prefrontal cortex were all significantly
higher than the global mean values, for both
the CNSP patient and control groups. In
addition, the observed ReHo patterns were
similar to those of the human DMN, con-
firming the reliability of the analysis method.29
ReHo differences between the CNSP and
control groups
Compared with healthy controls, CNSP
patients exhibited abnormal neural activity

in several specific brain regions. The results
showed that the regions with increased
ReHo values were predominantly located
at the bilateral MFG, and that those with
decreased ReHo values were located in the
left insula, SFG, MCG, SMA and right
PCG, and SPL. These results are largely
consistent with those of previous studies of
different types of chronic pain.2,15,17,20,30
The abnormal activity identified in the
current study was predominantly concen-
trated in the left hemisphere, possibly
related to the clinical observation of left-
hemispheric predominance in right-handed
patients. Tanja et al.31 reported left-
hemisphere dominance of the early sensory
component of pain perception using brain
electrical source analysis. The MCG is part
of the limbic lobe, which is associated with
affective processing during the experience
of pain.32 According to the James-Lange
theory, the insula and limbic lobe are
critical for emotional processing and pain
memory, a role previously ascribed to the
limbic system.33 A number of neuroima-
ging studies have revealed that the insula is
a functionally comprehensive, heteroge-
neous and multisensory integrated brain
region that participates in the processing of
pain perception and emotion, as well as the
sensory discrimination of pain perception,
acting as the primary cortex for interocep-
tion.33,34,35 The insula and cingulate gyrus
are key regions involved in the ``pain
matrix'', which is considered to be involved
in the perception of pain intensity and
emotional, homeostatic, sensorimotor and
cognitive functioning.36,37. A recent study
suggested that the insula plays an import-
ant role in the triggering of the pain matrix
network and the resulting emergence of the
subjective pain experience.38 Previous stu-
dies have suggested that the resting state
anterior insula-anterior cingulate cortex/
mid-cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC) system
integrates interoceptive emotional informa-
tion to form a subjective representation of
the body, and there is evidence that the
entire insula-MCC system is likely to be
involved in environmental monitoring,
response selection and skeletomotor body
orientation.39 Thus, the decreased ReHo

values in the MCG and insula observed in
the current study suggest that the abnorm-
alities may be related to functional impair-
ments in the long-term pain-related
affective response. The frontal lobe is
involved in a range of comprehensive and
complex functions, including integrating
and regulating affective and memory infor-
mation, personality, and cognition.40 The
SFG and MFG play a role in modulating
the cortical and subcortical nociceptive
pathways.41 Thus, the ReHo values in
bilateral MFG are likely to be significantly
increased when people are in a state of
chronic pain. Many previous studies of
various types of pain have reported ReHo
changes in the frontal lobe, but have
typically focused on the prefrontal lobe,
which is related to affective processing.42,43
Further studies are needed to explore the
role of the MFG in pain processing in
more depth. The decrease in ReHo values
we observed in PCG is consistent with the
results of a previous study.17 The PCG
comprises the primary somatosensory
cortex (S1), which is involved in the
somatotopic changes associated with pain
intensity, and the discrimination of the
sensory components of pain perception
(e.g., location, intensity and quality).17,44,45
The SPL and inferior parietal lobule also
belong to S1. The main function of the
parietal lobe is to integrate various types of
sensory information, which is similar to the
role of the PCG.44 A number of previous
reports have proposed that the SMA is
crucial for linking cognition to action, and
is primarily involved in controlling move-
ments (since neurons in the SMA project
directly to the spinal cord), pain anticipa-
tion and affective processing.46­48 In
patients with CNSP, decreased ReHo
values in the SMA may be related to
deficits in pain modulation and affective
response inhibition.15 In the current study,
several patients with severe pain and a high
VAS score exhibited weakness and
difficulty moving their upper limbs, which
may also be associated with decreased
ReHo values in the SMA. Based on the
current findings and the results of previous
studies, we speculate that patients with
different types of chronic pain may share a
common neurological and pathophysio-
logical basis, and that long-term chronic
pain is not only involves pain, but also
accompanied with the dysfunction of sen-
sory, cognitive and affection.
The MCG, which exhibited decreased
ReHo values, is part of the anterior DMN,
the insula participates in the composition of
the cingulate-insular network (CIN), and
the PCG and SMA are a part of the
sensorimotor network (SMN).49 Abnormal
brain activity in these regions may have an
impact on pain-related intrinsic connectivity
networks, including the DMN, CIN and
SMN in CNSP during the resting state. No
significant changes in ReHo values were
found in the ACC or PFC, in contrast with
several previous reports.2,12,13,15,17 The cur-
rent findings suggest that brain regions
exhibiting changes in ReHo values may be
related to the location of pain and its various
components (e.g., pain duration, attack fre-
quency and pain intensity). The discrepancy
between the current results and previous
reports may be related to these factors.
Further considerations
The current findings suggest that regional
abnormalities of selective brain regions are
related to pain perception, cognition and
affective processing. These results may have
implications for the clinical treatment of
CNSP, raising the possibility that the sub-
jective pain perception of patients with
CNSP might be decreased by reducing
brain activation in targeted areas associated
with the pain processing network.50,51
Although preliminary findings are promis-
ing, more research is needed before rs-fMRI
can be used routinely in the clinic.
Yu et al. 189
In addition future studies with larger sample
sizes are needed to confirm the current
findings. Specifically, further work is
needed to compare the influence of various
components of pain on brain function,
including pain duration, attack frequency
and pain intensity. Further exploration of
altered functional connectivity in these brain
regions is necessary.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the current study used ReHo
to reveal abnormal neuronal activity in
multiple regions involved in the integration
and processing of pain signals in the resting-
state in CNSP patients, including the bilat-
eral MFG, left insula, SFG, MCG, SMA,
and right PCG and SPL. This preliminary
study suggests that these brain regions may
be suitable targets for chronic pain treat-
ment, and provide a foundation for other
research to extend treatment strategies for
CNSP patients.
