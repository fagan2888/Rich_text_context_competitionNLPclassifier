The Experience of Symptoms of Depression in Men vs Women
Analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
Lisa A. Martin, PhD; Harold W. Neighbors, PhD; Derek M. Griffith, PhD
Depression is a costly and debilitating illness; approxi-
mately 16% of the US population (>32 million people)
will meet the criteria for major depressive disorder in
a given year.1 Typically, women are diagnosed with depres-
sion twice as often as men. This sex ratio appears in almost ev-
ery setting, including Western and most non-Western com-
munity studies.2-5 Most research exploring this difference
focuses on explanations for why women are at greater risk for
developing depression.
More than 10 years ago, an alternative approach to explain-
ing this disparity was proposed. This literature critiques the
validityofthecurrentdiagnosticcriteria,arguingthatmenmay
experience alternative depression symptoms.6 In part be-
cause traditional depressive symptoms (eg, sadness, crying)
are at odds with societal ideals of masculinity, men may be re-
luctant to report experiencing these symptoms. Second, men's
experiences of depression may manifest with symptoms that
are not currently included in traditional diagnostic criteria.
Addis7 proposes 4 conceptual frameworks within the exist-
ing literature that address how gender shapes men's experi-
ences, expressions, and reactions to depression: (1) the sex dif-
ferences framework, (2) the masked depression framework,
(3) the masculine depression framework, and (4) the gen-
dered response framework.
The sex differences framework is rooted in the idea that
the construct of depression is the same in men and women
and seeks to investigate sex differences in a range of related
variables, including symptoms.7 Although this has been a
popular approach to date, it is often critiqued for relying on
oppositional binaries that understand "male depression"
only as it is contrasted with "female depression, " which fails
to acknowledge the heterogeneity that exists within these
groups.
The masked depression framework proposes that men are
more likely to express their emotional and psychological dis-
tress in the form of "depressive equivalents"7 because direct
admission of sadness and emotional weakness or vulnerabil-
ity in men is seen as socially unacceptable.8 The biggest cri-
IMPORTANCE When men are depressed they may experience symptoms that are different
than what is included in the current diagnostic criteria.
OBJECTIVE To explore whether sex disparities in depression rates disappear when alternative
symptoms are considered in the place of, or in addition to, more conventional depression
symptoms.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using data from the
National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally represented mental health survey, we
evaluated sex differences in symptom endorsement in 2 new scales that included alternative
depression symptoms. We analyzed sex differences in symptom endorsement using 2-sided,
design-based, .05-level t tests and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of
depression.
RESULTS Men reported higher rates of anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and risk
taking compared with women. Analyses using the scale that included alternative, male-type
symptoms of depression found that a higher proportion of men (26.3%) than women (21.9%)
(P = .007) met criteria for depression. Analyses using the scale that included alternative and
traditional depression symptoms found that men and women met criteria for depression in
equal proportions: 30.6% of men and 33.3% of women (P = .57).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When alternative and traditional symptoms are combined,
sex disparities in the prevalence of depression are eliminated. Further study is needed to
clarify which symptoms truly describe men's experiences of depression.

tique of this framework is that it remains difficult to identify
the depressive equivalents.
The masculine depression framework hypothesizes that
the struggle to adhere to hegemonic masculine norms places
men at risk for experiencing an alternative depression vari-
ant often characterized by externalizing symptoms.7 Rather
thanappearingsad,menexperiencingemotionalpainaremore
likely to react with anger, self-destructive behavior, self-
distraction, or numbing of pain with substance use, gam-
bling, womanizing, and workaholism.9 Others have pro-
posed that irritability could be the key symptom linking men
and depression.8 Winkler et al10 found that male patients with
depressionscoredsignificantlyhigheronirritability,weremore
prone to overreact to minor annoyances, experienced anger
attacks (sudden spells of anger and aggression with physical
features similar to panic attacks), had lower impulse control,
exhibited greater substance use, and experienced more hy-
peractive behavior compared with depressed female
patients.9,11
The gendered response framework states that men's re-
sponses to negative affect, including depressed mood, grief,
and sadness, are shaped by men's adherence to or rejection of
hegemonic masculinity. Gender socialization can direct some
men to withhold or restrict emotional expression, leaving men
with limited ways to express their feelings of emotional pain
and psychological distress. Therefore, clinicians would need
to look at alternative negative outcomes to identify depres-
sion in their patients.7
Currently, 2 scales exist that evaluate the presence of al-
ternative "male-type" depression symptoms in groups of clini-
cal patients. The Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS) was
developed as part of a study investigating suicide in Sweden
and originally validated with a sample of men in treatment for
substance abuse.3,12,13 Since then, the GMDS has been used in
avarietyofsettingswithclinicalsamplesofmenandwomen.14
The second measure designed to identify male-type depres-
sion is the Masculine Depression Scale (MDS).15-17 The MDS is
a self-report scale designed to capture alternative symptoms
proposed in the literature to be more common in men's pre-
sentation of depression. Men who scored high on masculine
norms adherence were less likely to endorse traditional de-
pression items. Although both the GMDS and the MDS have
provided empirical evidence supporting men's alternative ex-
pression of depression, neither scale has been used in a na-
tionally representative sample of US residents.
The present study was a secondary analysis of the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),18 a nation-
ally representative sample of mental health data. We ad-
dressed a gap identified by Addis's masculine depression
frameworks7 by combining externalizing symptoms (eg, sub-
stance abuse, irritability, and anger) with traditional depres-
sion symptoms within the context of a nationally representa-
tive self-report sample. We created 2 new depression measures
by combining externalizing symptoms of depression pro-
posed by 2 previously validated measures of male-type de-
pression, the GMDS and the MDS, with traditional depression
symptoms. The first scale, referred to as the Male Symptoms
Scale (MSS), exclusively includes alternative male-type symp-
toms of depression, while the second scale combines these
symptoms with traditional depression items to create the Gen-
der Inclusive Depression Scale (GIDS) (see the eAppendix in
the Supplement for a description of the GIDS).
Methods
Sample Description
The present study uses secondary data analysis of the NCS-R,
a nationally representative survey of the incidence and preva-
lence of mental disorders among English-speaking adults of
the United States. It includes assessments based on the diag-
nostic criteria of the American Psychiatric Association as re-
ported in the DSM-IV.6 The NCS-R interview was adminis-
tered in 2 parts between February 2001 and April 2003. Part I
included a core diagnostic assessment of all respondents
(N = 9282). Part II was administered to a subset of the part I
respondentswhometlifetimecriteriaforanycoredisorderplus
a 1-in-3 probability subsample of other respondents (n = 5692).
Part II questioned respondents about correlates and addi-
tional disorders. (For a full description of the development of
the NCS-R, see Pennell and colleagues.18) This study used the
part II sample.
Creation of the MSS and GIDS
We used a 2-step process to create the 2 scales. One of us
(L.A.M.) conducted an extensive literature review to con-
structalistofalternativemale-typedepressionsymptoms.She
then compared this list against the NCS-R questionnaire and
data set to determine whether appropriate variables captur-
ing the desired symptoms could be identified. eTable 1 in the
Supplement lists the symptoms identified from the literature
review and whether they were included in the MSS or GIDS.
Symptoms were excluded from the scales for one of 3 pos-
sible reasons: (1) symptoms were deemed inappropriate, (2)
equivalentitemswerenotavailable,or(3)thenumberofpeople
for whom data were available for a symptom was too small to
be useful for the analysis (ie, <250 people).
ThefirstscaledevelopedforthepresentanalysisistheMSS,
which was developed to assess a male-type depression. It as-
sesses 8 constructs that have been proposed in the literature
as externalizing symptoms of depression in men: (1) irritabil-
ity, (2) anger attacks/aggression, (3) sleep disturbance, (4) al-
cohol/other drug abuse, (5) risk-taking behavior, (6) hyperac-
tivity, (7) stress, and (8) loss of interest in pleasurable activities.
Two of the symptoms included in the MSS (sleep disturbance
and loss of interest in pleasurable activities) are part of tradi-
tional measures of depression but were included because they
addressexternalizingactionsandappearassymptomsineither
the GMDS or the MDS.
The second scale designed to assess male depression is the
GIDS, which consists of 15 symptoms. The GIDS includes all
the MSS symptoms as well as 7 traditional symptoms of de-
pression, including sad/depressed mood, loss of vitality, tired-
ness, ambivalence, anxiety/uneasiness, and complaintive-
ness (feeling pathetic). See the eAppendix in the Supplement

25 items appear in the screening section of the NCS-R, 3 items
weretakenfromthe30-daysymptomsassessmentportion,and
1 item each came from Neurasthenia, Personality, and Mania.
Most items assess the lifetime presence of the symptom; there-
fore, we frame the prevalence of the depression using the MSS
and GIDS as lifetime estimates of depression.
Scoring the MSS and GIDS
We calculated a simple index for each of the 2 scales that added
1 point for each symptom endorsed in the scale. Symptoms
were considered present as long as one of the items assessing
thatconstructwasendorsed.ScoresontheMSScanrangefrom
0 to 8. Respondents were divided into 2 categories: individu-
als with scores of 1 to 4 were classified as not meeting depres-
sion criteria, and those with scores of 5 or higher were consid-
ered depression cases. The GIDS includes 25 items assessing
15 symptoms, and GIDS scores can range from 0 to 15. We split
this group into 3 severity levels: respondents with GIDS scores
of 1 to 4 were labeled mild cases, not meeting depression cri-
teria, those with scores of 5 to 9 symptoms were considered
moderate cases, and those with scores ranging from 10 to 15
werelabeledseverecases.Welatercombinedthemoderateand
severe groups so that respondents with a score of 5 or higher
on a scale were identified as meeting criteria for depression.
The 5-point cutoff is modeled after the DSM-IV definition of
major depressive disorder: the presence of at least 5 symp-
toms of depression that occur within the same 2-week period
is one of the main requirements for meeting the diagnostic cri-
teria for major depression.6
Statistical Analysis
We used STATA 10.0 statistical software (SE version; StataCorp
LP) for all statistical analyses.19 The sampling methods used in
the data collection necessitated using the complex survey data
methods in the STATA statistical package to correctly calculate
thestandarderrors.InternalconsistencywasmeasuredbyCron-
bach . Values of 0.7 or greater are acceptable, whereas values
of 0.6 or less indicate that the items may not be related or do
not measure the same construct.20 Concurrent validity of the
MSS and GIDS was investigated by correlational analyses with
lifetime diagnoses of major depressive episode (MDE), alcohol
abuse, other drug abuse, and intermittent explosive disorder
(IED). Bivariate analyses tested for potential sex differences in
symptom endorsement for each of the newly constructed de-
pression scales. Statistical significance was evaluated using
2-sided, design-based, .05-level tests.
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1 was that the MSS and GIDS will exhibit a posi-
tive strong correlation with MDE and be moderately corre-
lated with alcohol abuse, other drug abuse, and IED. If the new
scales are indeed measuring depression, we expect them to be
closely correlated with an existing measure of depression. If
men mask depression with substance abuse, as suggested in
the literature, we would expect the 2 scales to be positively re-
lated to alcohol and other drug abuse. Because anger has been
theorized to be a depressive symptom for men and IED has
demonstratedmoderatebutsignificantcomorbiditywithmood
disorders, we expect to find a moderate relationship between
IED and the MSS and GIDS.21
Hypothesis 2 was that male depression as measured by the
MSS will be more prevalent among men than women. The MSS
includes symptoms that depressed men could be more will-
ing to admit to in the place of traditional depression symp-
toms. The MSS is based on the literature showing that men are
more prone to irritability, hyperactivity, violence, and so-
matic symptoms (energy loss and sleep issues).10,11,22 Al-
thoughitispossiblethatsomewomenwillendorsetheseatypi-
cal male-type symptoms, if the MSS truly captures male
depression, then depression should be more prevalent among
men than women.
Hypothesis3wasthattheprevalenceofmaledepressionas
measuredbytheGIDSwillresultinnogenderdifferences.Incon-
trast to the MSS, the GIDS takes a different approach. The GIDS
combinesthemale-typesymptomsoftheMSSwithseveraltra-
ditionalsymptomsofdepression.Thus,theGIDSisdesignedto
be inclusive of both traditional and male-specific symptoms of
depression.Thishypothesisassumesthatmaledepressionisnot
a separate disorder from major depression but that the current
symptom profile does not include symptoms that reflect men's
experiences. If this is the case, then the GIDS will identify an
equal number of depression cases across the sexes.
Hypothesis 4 was that men will endorse the nontradi-
tionalsymptomswithgreaterfrequencythanwomenwill.This
final hypothesis investigates whether there are sex differences
among the specific items that have been added as alternative
expressions of depression. So far, the literature reports mixed
results regarding symptom endorsements. Möller-Leimkühler
et al17 used the GMDS in a clinical sample of men and women
and found no differences in the percentages of item endorse-
ment between the sexes. Winkler et al10 found that male pa-
tients with depression scored significantly higher on irritabil-
ity, experienced anger attacks, had lower impulse control,
exhibited greater substance use, and experienced more hyper-
active behavior compared with depressed female patients.
Results
Sample Characteristics
The demographic characteristics of the sample are summa-
rized in Table 1. There were significantly more women in the
sample (3310 [58.5%]) compared with men (2382 [41.5%]). The
mean age of respondents was 45.2 years, 73.4% of the sample
was non-Hispanic white, and more than half (51.6%) had some
education beyond high school. The mean annual household
income was $59 575. Men's mean and median incomes were
both significantly higher than women's. The mean income for
men was $63 365 vs $49 327 for women, and the median in-
comewas$53 500formencomparedwith$44 000forwomen.
Internal Consistency
Internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach , assesses the
correlation of items within a measure or subscale. Both scales
demonstrated acceptable internal consistency: the Cronbach
 for the MSS was 0.71 and for the GIDS was 0.78.

Concurrent Validity
We ran correlational analysis to investigate the concurrent va-
lidity of the MSS and the GIDS with theoretically related con-
structs. Table 2 summarizes the correlation coefficients among
the MSS, the GIDS, and MDE, other drug abuse, alcohol abuse,
and IED. We tested the hypothesis that both alternative mea-
sures of depression would be significantly positively corre-
lated with a traditional measure of depression, and this hy-
pothesis was supported: the correlation coefficient for MDE
and the MSS was 0.70 and for MDE and the GIDS was 0.85. The
only relationship that showed a stronger relationship was be-
tween the MSS and the GIDS, as would be expected given that
the MSS is a component of the GIDS. Positive strong to mod-
erate relationships were found between the 2 scales and alco-
hol and other drug abuse, with correlation coefficients rang-
ing from 0.46 to 0.32. The 2 scales demonstrated positively
weak relationships to IED (coefficients were 0.26 and 0.23 for
the MSS and GIDS, respectively).

pression using the MSS was 23.8%, and the mean score was

hypothesiswassupported:theprevalenceofdepressioninmen
was 26.3% but the prevalence in women was 21.9%, a signifi-
cant difference (P = .007). We also found sex differences in the
rate of endorsement of the specific items constituting the MSS.
Men endorsed the following items at significantly higher rates
than women: anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and
risk-taking behavior. Women endorsed 4 symptoms at signifi-
cantly greater rates than men: stress, irritability, sleep prob-
lems, and loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, such as
work, hobbies, and personal relationships.
Gender Inclusive Depression Scale
Using the 5-point cutoff, we found no sex difference in the
prevalence of depression as assessed by the GIDS, which con-
firmed our third hypothesis. We also compared prevalence by
the3severitylevels:mild(1-4symptoms),moderate(5-9symp-
toms), and severe (10-15 symptoms). As a result, 63.2% of men
and 62.0% of women fell into the mild category, 28.3% of men
and 28.9% of women fell into the moderate category, and 8.5%
of men and 9.1% of women fell into the severe category. No sig-
nificant sex differences were demonstrated at any severity
level.
Hypothesis 4 stated that men would endorse the alter-
native symptoms of depression at higher rates than women,
but the results of these analyses were mixed. Men endorsed
substance abuse, anger attacks/aggression, and risk-taking
behavior at higher rates than women when depression was
assessed by the MSS (Table 3) (see eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment for the GIDS item endorsements). When depression
was assessed using the GIDS, men endorsed anger attacks/
aggression, substance abuse, risk-taking behavior, and
hyperactivity more than women. Women endorsed 6 symp-
toms at significantly higher rates than men: stress, indeci-
siveness, anxiety, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and
complaintiveness. Irritability was endorsed equally by men
and women. Examining the top endorsed symptoms
revealed similar patterns for men and women. Depressed
mood was the principal symptom for both men and women,
and anger attacks/aggression, stress, irritability, and
anxiety/uneasiness constituted the remainder of the top 5
symptoms reported for both sexes.
Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to assess the impli-
cations of considering alternative, male-type symptoms of
depression for sex differences in the prevalence of depres-
sion in a nationally representative sample of US adults.
Although men were likely to endorse many traditional
depression symptoms, men were significantly more likely to
report symptoms of anger attacks/aggression, irritability,
substance abuse, and risk-taking behaviors over symptoms
such as withdrawal from friends, sleep problems, and feel-
ings of complaintiveness. These results suggest that relying
only on men's disclosure of traditional symptoms could lead
to an underdiagnosis of depression in men and that clini-
cians should consider other clues when assessing depres-
sion in men.
Thisstudyincluded2measuresofdepressioncriteria.Both
scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. The 2
scales also were highly correlated with each other, as well as
with MDE, indicating that they are measuring related con-
structs. The fact that the 2 scales were more strongly corre-
lated with an established depression construct (MDE) com-
pared with the other disorders provides evidence of construct
validity, namely, that these scales measure an alternative ex-
pression of depression.
The MSS consists of alternative symptoms suggested by
the literature as well as traditional symptoms that are not
stereotypically associated with femininity. The MSS found
that depression was more prevalent among men than
women and more prevalent among men than major depres-
sion. Using the MSS, we found that men endorsed some of
these male-type symptoms at higher rates than women did,
including anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and
risk-taking behavior. Women endorsed stress, irritability,
sleep problems, and loss of interest at significantly higher
levels. The loss of interest and sleep items are part of tradi-
tional depression criteria, and psychological distress is often
perceived as a proxy for depressed mood; therefore, it is not
surprising that women endorsed these items at higher rates
than men. The fact that irritability was endorsed more by

men than women was somewhat surprising but consistent
with the findings of Fava et al23 that more women than men
meet criteria for an irritable-type depression.
The second scale, the GIDS, included traditional depres-
sion items as well as the alternative, male-type items from
the MSS. The MSS appeared to identify depression in a
group of men who disclosed more externalizing symptoms.
However, we know that men's experiences of depression are
not uniform. For some men, these alternative symptoms
would be enough to assess depression, while others would
experience the more traditional symptoms of depression.
Given that a significant number of women also met our
depression case criteria using the MSS indicates that both
women and men would benefit from a scale that contains an
array of symptoms that better reflect the heterogeneity of
the depression experience. Similar to the MSS results, the
GIDS identified depression in men more often than when
only the traditional DSM-IV criteria were used. This rate also
was higher than the number of depressed men identified
with the MSS. The most important finding was that, when
the GIDS was used, men and women met criteria for depres-
sion in equal proportions. When alternative symptoms were
included in depression case criteria, more male depression
cases were identified than when traditional criteria were
used, indicating that men experience these symptoms in
greater numbers. This finding is similar to the work by
Möller-Leimkühler et al,17 which found that men and
women met criteria for depression at similar rates using the
GMDS with a clinical in-patient sample.
Despitethesignificantfindingsreportedinthisstudy,there
are noteworthy limitations. First, because this was a second-
ary data analysis, not all constructs put forth in the literature
could be included. For example, others have proposed that de-
pressed men commonly try to mask or ignore their emotional
pain by overworking, overexercising, or changing their sexual
behavior.24 These symptoms, along with other risky behav-
iors such as gambling, could not be assessed in the present
study. Although a few questions regarding job performance,
exercise, and gambling were available owing to the structure
of the interview, using them would have resulted in an insuf-
ficient sample size. In addition, several of the included con-
structs were imperfect for this study. For example, the items
that assess taking chances and reckless behavior were not put
into the context of linking the behavior to an emotional con-
dition. However, these items were still included because they
were the best items available. Future studies should include
items that assess the excluded behaviors. Finally, we cannot
be confident that all the symptoms assessed in our scale were
present during the same time period. Although most of the
items came from the screening section of the interview, some
items used a lifetime context while others were limited to the
past 30 days.
The present study examined sex differences in rates of de-
pression.The2newscalesweredevelopedusingthebestproxy
items in the NCS-R item bank. Therefore, we are not propos-
ing that these scales be used in future study, rather we hope
that these findings provide evidence for future nationally rep-
resentative assessments of depression to include measures of
gender norms as well as expanded item pools.
Future studies may want to include measures of gender
in addition to sex because often, when masculinity is mea-
sured, the degree of masculinity explains more variance in de-
pression rates than does sex alone.17 Therefore, future stud-
ies trying to understand the differences between men and
women in the prevalence of depression should include mea-
sures that attempt to understand how masculinity and femi-
ninity influence depression rates rather than relying on sex
alone as an indicator.
Ultimately, the results of this work have the potential to
bring significant advances to the field in terms of the per-
ception and measurement of depression. These findings
could lead to important changes in the way depression is
conceptualized and measured. Future iterations of this
work should build on the findings here to continue to
explore the relationship between sex, gender, and depres-
sion. Our findings showed that men are willing to endorse
the alternative depression symptoms, leading to the elimi-
nation of sex differences in the prevalence of depression.
The goal of this analysis was to explore whether the ways in
which men and women experience depression is different
from the way depression currently is identified in commu-
nity surveys. The current depression criteria may be biased
toward detecting symptoms that are more common in
women. Our findings, however, highlight that male-type
symptoms also are fairly common in women. Gender is
likely to play an important role in how men and women
conceptualize and experience depression. Therefore, fur-
ther study is needed to clarify which symptoms truly
describe men's experiences of depression. This study sug-
gests that asking about irritability, anger, and substance
abuse is important when assessing depression in men and
women.
