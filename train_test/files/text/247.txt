OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative in¯uence of menopausal status and hormone use on body mass index (BMI) among a
multiethnic sample of mid-life women.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey conducted at seven sites where each site targeted an ethnic minority group and
Caucasians as part of Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).
SUBJECTS: A total of 7181 Caucasians, 3949 African-Americans, 1660 Hispanics, 562 Chinese Americans, and 803 Japanese
Americans between ages of 40 and 55 y residing in or near Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark, NJ, Oakland, CA, and
Pittsburgh, PA.
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported BMI based on weight in kg divided by height in m2 menopausal status, physical inactivity,
postmenopausal hormone use, ethnicity, and age in years.
RESULTS: Compared to premenopausal women (covariate adjusted M  27.3), women reporting a surgical menopause
(M  28.2) or being in the perimenopausal transition (M  27.7 for early and 27.9 for late perimenopause) had higher BMI.
Women reporting a natural menopause (M  27.4) did not have a higher BMI than premenopausal women, after adjusting for
chronological age and other covariates. Hormone use was associated with lower BMI (M  26.5 vs 27.3). A comparison of effect
sizes showed that menopausal status (F  13.1), followed by chronological age (F  24.0), were the least powerful predictors of
BMI, whereas the more powerful predictors were physical activity level (F  1377.1) and ethnicity (F  400.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The menopausal transition affects body mass index in mid-life, but the effect is small relative to other
in¯uences. Interventions to increase physical activity are highly recommended to prevent increases in adiposity common in
mid-life.

Introduction
Body weight and mortality from all causes are directly related
in middle-aged US women.1,2 The lowest mortality rates are
obtained among thin women who have had stable weight
since early adulthood.1 Excess body weight is associated with
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality at all ages, except
perhaps after 75 y.3 The relative risk associated with obesity
is largest in women aged 45 ± 54 at study entry and declines
with age thereafter.3
It appears that US women gain substantial weight in mid-
life.4 In the 10 y prospective study of the First National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study, the greatest proportion of newly over-
weight (de®ned as ! 27.3 BMI) among initially normal
weight women (`27.3 BMI) occurred in the age group of
35 ± 44 y at study onset, ie by the time they were 45 ± 54 y.
However, major weight gain (de®ned as 5 kgam2) occurred
among those already overweight at baseline in both African-
American and Caucasian women. Among women not over-
weight at baseline, African-American women were nearly
twice as likely as white women to become overweight

during the follow-up period. Furthermore, among women at
study entry under the age4 of 45, African-American women
were more likely to become overweight than Caucasians.
Women's weight gain and increase in adiposity in mid-life
are thought to occur through a number of mechanisms,
including lowered physical activity and resting metabolic
rate.5 ± 7 It is less clear if changing reproductive hormone
levels associated with the perimenopausal transition affect
weight gain. Although almost all the available longitudinal
studies of the perimenopausal transition show that the
natural menopause does not uniquely affect BMI when
controlling for chronological age,8 ± 10 these studies are not
conclusive because the study designs typically compared pre-
and post-menopausal levels of weight adjusted for height
and did not report perimenopausal levels of weight. The
populations were almost exclusively white and the effects of
the perimenopause may vary by ethnicity. In addition,
almost all these studies recruited women who were still
menstruating and in their mid- to late forties. Thus, the
many women who had a surgical menopause (hysterectomy
or oophorectomy) would have been excluded, as the peak
age of hysterectomy is 35 ± 44 y.11 In consequence, the effect
of surgical menopause on weight is not as well established
using prospective designs, although cross-sectional data do
suggest that women who have had a hysterectomy are
heavier.12 ± 15 Finally, some of the postmenopausal women
have used hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Available
clinical trials show that estrogen replacement therapy may
slow weight gain in mid-life and the accompanying increase
in central adiposity16 ± 18 and longitudinal data suggest that
women who choose to use HRT are thinner.19,20 Thus, it is
important to separate the effects of menopausal status and
the use of HRT.
Another well-known determinant of obesity in women is
low social class.21 Low education and income is associated
with BMI in many studies. Some ethnic differences in BMI
may be due in part to the fact that some ethnic groups have
more members with lower education, income and occupa-
tional prestige than do whites. In addition, some ethnic
differences in BMI may be due in part to the greater pre-
valence of other risk factors for obesity, eg physical inactivity
and smoking.22,23
The present report describes the prevalence of obesity in a
large multi-ethnic sample of mid-life women residing in
seven areas of the United States. It evaluates the associations
of BMI (as a continuous variable) simultaneously with
ethnicity, menopausal status, use of HRT, educational
attainment and age among Caucasians, African-Americans,
Hispanics, Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans.
Methods
Study population
Seven sites participating in the Study of Women's Health
across the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal study of mid-life
aging, invited women to complete a 15 min telephone inter-
view if they met all the following criteria: age 40 ± 55;
Caucasian or self-identi®ed primary or mixed ethnicity in
the site's targeted ethnic groups; ability to speak and read
English or a designated other language speci®c to targeted
ethnic group; and willingness and ability to provide verbal
informed consent. The sites, their ethnic group in addition
to Caucasian, and sampling methods are as follows:
Oakland, CA, Chinese, Chinese-American, sampling the
membership lists of a managed health care plan with
preference for Chinese surnames; Los Angeles, Japanese,
Japanese-American, random-digit telephone dialing,
sampling of Japanese surnames from telephone directory
and voter registration lists, sampling of ethnic organization
members, and sampling the acquaintence network of those
already identi®ed for study; Chicago, African-American,
sampling from a householdacommunity complete census
list constructed for an earlier study; Boston, African-Amer-
ican, sampling from the Massachusetts state census list;
Detroit, African-American, sampling from local electric
company house-hold lists; Pittsburgh, African-American,
random-digit telephone dialing, sampling from voter
registration lists; Newark, Hispanic-American, random-digit
telephone dialing, sampling from the acquaintence network
of those already identi®ed for study (the Hispanic-American
category included Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central-
American, Cuban, Cuban American, South American,
Spanish and very few Mexican Americans).
All sites used a standard set of codes to categorize the
outcome of every potential interview. These codes were
assigned to households for random digit dialing and electric
company household lists, and otherwise assigned to indivi-
duals. The 16 065 women who completed the telephone
interview included 7772 Caucasians, 4383 African-
Americans, 1955 Hispanic American, 854 Japanese or
Japanese-Americans, 651 Chinese or Chinese-Americans,
and 450 of mixed, unde®ned or unknown ethnicity, accord-
ing to their self-de®nitions. They represent 82 ± 99.7% of
those known to be eligible for the study at the various
sites; the remaining eligible women were unwilling to be
interviewed fully. In addition to the eligible women who
could not or would not be interviewed fully, there were at
each site women whose eligibility could not be ascertained,
because they could not be contacted or they refused to
answer any questions at all. The fraction of these unascer-
tained women who were eligible for the interview is
unknown. If ascertained and unascertained women are
equally likely to be eligible for the interview, then the
women completing the interviews represent 24 ± 94% of
the total women eligible in the target. Sampling methods
and participation rates for each site are fully described
elsewhere.24
Data of 14 148 women of the 16 065 women constitute
the basis of the present report. Data of women were excluded
from the analysis as follows: 557 women with missing data
needed to compute BMI; nine women with BMI values out of

range (`14.0 or b 72.0); another 433 women with missing
or mixedaother ethnicity; 316 women with missing meno-
pausal status; 53 women currently lactating or pregnant;
and 542 women missing covariate information, eg smoking
history. Women with missing or out of range BMI data were
more likely than other women to be Hispanic and less
likely to be Caucasian, Chinese or Japanese Americans, less
likely to have a high school education, and less likely
to report using hormones in the last 3 months.
Survey method and variables
The study coordinating center trained all interviewers and
certi®ed each based on recorded andaor monitored test
interviews with naive respondents. Interviewer performance
was then periodically monitored by the coordinating center
and by senior staff at each site. All interviewers used stan-
dardized scripts. Most interviews were computer-assisted,
including automatic checks of data ranges at the time of
collection. Data recorded by hand were range-checked at the
time of subsequent computer entry. All data were transferred
to a central computer at the study coordinating center, and
there tested for ranges and internal validity and assembled
into a SAS data set, which was distributed back to all sites for
analyses.
The telephone interview covered a broad range of sub-
jects, relevant to women's health in mid-life including qual-
ity of life, health status, medical history, lifestyle and
symptoms. We report here data on self-reported weight
(with light clothing on) and height (with no shoes) in
relation to sociodemographic variables and reproductive
hormone status. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared. Years of education were
grouped into less than high school, high school degree, some
college, 4 y college degree, more than a 4 y college degree.
Determination of menopausal status was based on several
questions about recency of menses, regularity between men-
strual ¯ow and occurrence of hysterectomy. Women were
classi®ed into ®ve groups: surgical menopause (having a
hysterectomy or both ovaries removed); natural menopause
(not menstruating within last 12 months not due to medica-
tion, chemotherapy, pregnancy, breast-feeding or severe
weight loss); late perimenopause (not menstruating for 3 ±
11 months); early perimenopause (menstruating in last 3
months, with interval between menses reported as `less
predictable'; and premenopause (menstruating in last 3
months and interval between menses reported as predict-
able). Extensive research shows that women can reliably and
validly report menstrual history, age at menopause within
1 y, and occurrence of hysterectomy and ovarian sur-
gery.25 ± 27 Women who indicated that they had taken `any
female hormones, including birth control pills' in the last 3
months were considered hormone users. Number of children
was recorded. Age was used as a continuous variable. Women
were asked if they were a current or past smoker and if their
usual activity level was much less, somewhat less, about the
same, somewhat more, or much more than women of the
same age. This comparative self-rating of activity was used in
a number of previous population-based studies, includ-
ing the 1985 National Health Interview Survey Health Pro-
motionaDisease Prevention Supplement,28 and the CARDIA
study of African American and Caucasian adults.29 In the
present sample, the associations between compara-
tive physical activity rating and established correlates of
activity, such as overall health and employment status,
were obtained and were similar in each ethnic group.30
Validity of self-reported height and weight
Of the women who participated in the cross-sectional survey,
2963 women who were eligible for and were enrolled in the
SWAN longitudinal study had their height and weight mea-
sured in a standardized fashion within 3 months of the
telephone interview and had BMI data within range. In the
full sample, the associations between self-reported and mea-
sured height, weight and BMI were high and the median
differences between self-reported and measured values were
quite small (Table 1). An examination of the associations for
BMI in each ethnic group taken separately showed that they
were slightly lower in the Hispanic sample due to lower
height associations and in the Japanese sample due to
lower weight associations. Given the magnitude of the
associations and that weight can easily ¯uctuate the magni-
tude reported in Table 1 within a 3 month period of time,
these ®ndings suggest that self-reported BMI is a reasonable
proxy for measured BMI.
Data reduction and analysis
The percentage of women who were in the categories of
overweight and obese was initially computed using the
NHLBI standards for overweight and obese of BMI ! 25 ±
29.9, and ! 30, respectively.31 Other participant character-
istics were summarized for the full analytic sample using
proportions and by ethnicity using chi-square because of the
substantial differences by ethnicity in the distributions of
the predictor variables.
Predictors of BMI were identi®ed using linear regression
modeling. The distribution of BMI was not normal
(skewness  1.37, kurtosis  2.66) and was transformed by
natural log for statistical analysis. This transformation
improved the residuals from the linear regression (see
below), making the distribution of residuals closer to a
normal distribution. As all the linear univariate associations
of the major independent predictors in this paper (ethnicity,
educational attainment, menopausal status, hormone use
and continuous age) were signi®cant, a full multivariate
model, which also included number of children, smoking
status and physical activity as covariates, was calculated. To
simplify the interpretation of the coef®cients from the linear
regression model, adjusted subgroup means and standard
errors have been computed on the original scale for BMI,

using a non-parametric technique that does not require
normally distributed residuals32 and are presented in ®gures
below. The relative importance of sets of categorical vari-
ables, eg ethnicity or menopausal status, was assessed using
F-statistics for removal from the model.33 Denoting the
residual sum of squares for the reduced model as RSSr and
the corresponding term for the full model as RSSf, the
F-statistic was computed as follows: (RSSr 7 RSSfaq)a
(RSSfa(n 7 k), where q is the number of variables removed
from the full model, n is the same size, and k is the number of
variables in the full model. For a single predictor, such as
current smoking, the F-statistic is equivalent to the square to
the t-statistic, where the t-statistic is given by the coef®cient
divided by its standard error. The increase in r2 from adding
the predictor (or set of categorical predictors) to the model
including all other predictors also was computed as an
additional indicator of the strength of the relationship
with log BMI.
Corresponding linear regression models were also esti-
mated stratifying by ethnicity. The statistical signi®cance
of ethnic differences in the regression coef®cients was
estimated by adding appropriate interaction terms to the
regression model estimated in the full sample and using the
F-statistic for removal from the model. A Bonferroni correc-
tion for multiple comparisons was applied to achieve a 0.05
signi®cance level for each set of interactions with ethnicity,
eg educational level by ethnicity. It should be noted the
power of the analysis to detect ethnic differences in predic-
tors was affected by low numbers in some of the subgroups,
eg hormone users among the Chinese Americans.
The role of ®eld site in predicting BMI was determined as
follows. First, site indicators were added as predictors to the
model estimated in the full sample. Because three ethnic
groups were studied at only one site (Chinese at Oakland,
Japanese at Los Angeles, Hispanics at Newark), site and
ethnicity were confounded for these ethnic groups. Thus,
we only computed between-site differences for Caucasians
and African-Americans in separate models, after adjustment
for all covariates.
Results
The number and percentages of women for the full sample and
for each targeted ethnic group are described according to
menopausal status, hormone use, educational attainment,
age categories, number of children, smoking status and physi-
cal activity in Table 2. By design, the sample contained about
50% Caucasians, with 28% African-American. Smaller num-
bers of the other ethnic groups were available because they
were recruited at only one site, with some differences in
numbers due to differences in ef®ciencies of sampling frames
at those sites.24 In this sample of women aged 40 ± 55, almost
36% were postmenopausal, 33% premenopausal, and the
others in varying stages of the perimenopausal transition.
Approximately 19% of the women reporting using hormones
in the last 3 months. Educational attainment varied substan-
tially with nearly 35% of the sample having a high school
degree or less education and 33% having a college degree or
more. Almost a quarter of the women were current smokers
and almost 40% considered themselves similar in activity level
to other same-aged women.
All predictor variables varied by ethnicity, P`0.001, and
are the subject of subsequent reports. In general, relative to
other ethnic groups, African-American women were more
likely to be postmenopausal, particularly surgically post-
menopausal, Caucasian women to use hormones, Hispanic
Americans to have less than a high school education,
African-Americans and Caucasians to smoke cigarettes cur-
rently, and African-Americans and Hispanics to report less
physical activity.

According to NHLBI standards, 54% were overweight and
26% were obese in the total sample. Ethnic differences in
obesity were pronounced, with under 4% of Chinese and
Japanese women and over 40% of African-American women
categorized as obese (Table 3). Prevalence of obesity was
highest among women with a surgical menopause and
lowest among the premenopausal women. Hormone users
were less likely to be obese than non-users. There was a trend
of decreasing obesity with increasing education, ranging
from 34% for women without a high school degree to 19%
for women with post-graduate study. Past smokers were more
likely to be obese than never or current smokers; women
with 3  children were more likely to be obese than those
with less; and women who were less active relative to their
peers were more likely to be obese than their more active
counterparts. Although the correlations between self-
reported BMI and measured BMI is very high in this and
other samples,34,35 the tendency to under-report BMI may
have resulted in a slight under-estimation of the prevalence
of obesity in this sample.
Table 4 shows the multivariate model testing the inde-
pendent in¯uence of the major sociodemographic character-
istics of the study population, menopausal and hormonal
status, and covariates, except for site. This model accounted
for 22.5% of the variance in log BMI. Relative to Caucasian
women, African-American women had greater mean BMI

and Asian Americans had smaller mean BMI. Hispanics and
Caucasians were similar in BMI (Figure 1).
Compared to premenopausal status, the effects of post-
menopausal status depended on whether menopause was
natural or due to hysterectomyaoophorectomy (Figure 2).
After adjustment for all covariates, including chronological
age, women with a surgical menopause had greater BMI,
relative to premenopausal women, whereas women with a
natural menopause had a similar BMI to premenopausal
women. Women who had a bilateral oophorectomy had a
similar BMI to women who had a hysterectomy and retained
at least one ovary (data not shown). Women who were in the
perimenopausal transition had elevated BMI, compared to
premenopausal women. Length of time since last menses did
not account for the difference in mean BMI for surgical
menopausal versus natural menopausal women (data not
shown).
Hormone use was an independent in¯uence on BMI in
this sample, with hormone users reporting lower BMI, even
when adjustments were made for the well-known correlates
of hormone use, ie educational attainment and menopausal
status (adjusted M  26.3 vs 27.3).
Cigarette smoking was an independent predictor of BMI,
with current smokers having a lower BMI than never smo-
kers (adjusted M  26.09 vs 27.31), who in turn were lighter
than previous smokers (adjusted M  27.78). Educational
attainment also predicted BMI, independently of the other
factors. Tests for interactions of ethnicity with age, educa-
tional attainment, hormone use and menopausal status
showed that ethnicity Â educational attainment interaction
was signi®cant, P`0.0001. This interaction shows that the
education gradient with BMI was smaller in all the minority
groups than the gradient in Caucasians (data not shown).
It is noteworthy that the largest effect in the multivariate
model predicting BMI was for physical activity level (Figure
3), followed by ethnicity and smoking status. The increase in
r2 is slightly higher for the four ethnicity indicators than for
physical activity, but physical activity uses only a single
degree of freedom whereas ethnicity requires four degrees
of freedom, one for each of the separate ethnicity indicator
predictors. Furthermore, separate analyses by ethnic group
showed that physical activity level had the largest effect size
in each ethnic speci®c multivariate model, although the
effect size was larger among Caucasians than other ethnic
groups (data not shown). Menopausal status, albeit statisti-
cally signi®cant, was the least powerful predictor in the
present sample.
When site indicators were added to the model, the per-
centage of variance in BMI explained increased to 23.6%.
Women at Detroit had a signi®cantly higher average
adjusted BMI than did women at the other sites. The primary
effect on the other coef®cients was that the coef®cient
comparing Japanese Americans to Caucasian women
decreased in magnitude (became less negative). This
occurred because adding an indicator for the Los Angeles
site changed the comparison from Japanese women at Los
Angeles vs all Caucasians to Japanese women at Los Angeles
vs Caucasian women at Los Angeles. Because the Los Angeles
Caucasians had lower BMI than Caucasians at other sites,
they were more similar to Japanese women than were
Caucasians at other sites; consequently the coef®cient for
Japanese women was smaller in the model including site
indicators. When site was included in the multivariate

model, the F-statistic to remove ethnicity declined to 147.65
from 400.49 in the model without site. In the model includ-
ing site, the most important variables predicting BMI were
physical activity followed by ethnicity.
The analyses by site among Caucasians only showed that
Caucasians at Detroit had higher BMI than those at all other
sites, whereas those in Los Angeles had lower BMI than those
at all other sites (Table 3). Tests for site effects among the four
sites that recruited African-Americans showed no signi®cant
site effects after adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Discussion
In this large multi-ethnic cohort of mid-life women, the
prevalence of self-reported obesity was high. Using the
NHLBI standards, 55% were overweight and 27% were
obese. Ethnic differences in obesity were pronounced, with
under 4% of Chinese and Japanese women, 23% of Hispanic
and Caucasian women, and 43% of African-American
women obese. As in other studies,21 higher BMI was asso-
ciated with lower social class, in this study measured by
educational attainment. After adjustment for educational
attainment as well as other factors that covaried with ethni-
city (including physical activity, smoking status, use of HRT,
menopausal status, number of children, and age), the ethnic
differences in BMI remained apparent.
Both hormone use and menopausal status were indepen-
dently associated with women's BMI. Hormone users had
lower BMI than had nonusers, an observation consistent
with other studies of both African-American and Caucasian
women19,20 and with the results of clinical trials suggesting
that lower weight gain among women treated with estrogen
hormone replacement.16 ± 18 As in previous longitudinal stu-
dies,8 ± 10 BMI was similar for premenopausal and natural
postmenopausal women, when statistical adjustments were
made for chronological age as well as other covariates.
However, women who had entered the early or late peri-
menopausal had elevated BMI, relative to premenopausal
women, a pattern obtained previously in an Italian sample.36
These ®ndings suggest that changing hormone levels may
accelerate weight gain early in the transition, even though
weight gain by the time of the natural cessation of menses
may be no more than is apparent with usual mid-life aging.
This ®nding bears resemblance to the results from PEPI:18
women randomly assigned to use estrogen alone or with
progestins had a smaller weight gain during the ®rst year of

hormone exposure and thereafter exhibited the same weight
gain, relative to women assigned to placebo. Poehlman37
observed in a small study that women who became post-
menopausal lost more fat-free mass and gained more fat
mass than did women who remained premenopausal, with
no group differences in weight. Applying this observation to
the present results, the change in BMI due to natural meno-
pause may be nonsigni®cant, even when there are signi®cant
changes in more precise measures of adiposity.38
Although women who had a natural menopause were
similar in BMI to premenopausal women, women who
reported a surgical menopause had elevated BMI. Surgical
menopause may cause accelerated weight gain, above and
beyond the effect of chronological aging or becoming post-
menopausal naturally, because the surgical menopausal
women had their uterus andaor ovaries removed prior to
the SWAN survey and presumably had a long exposure to
their absence. However, our analyses did not show an effect
of age at menopause on BMI. Surgical menopause, even in
the absence of removal of ovaries, may lead to lower uterine
blood ¯ow and to early ovarian failure.39 ± 42 Surgical meno-
pause is usually preceded by a period of illness (and inactiv-
ity) that may contribute to both relative and absolute body
fatness due to loss of muscle and bone. Surgical menopause
alters total body fatness in several longitudinal studies16,43
and weight in several cross-sectional studies.12 ± 15 New
weight gain was reported by a minority of women under-
going surgical menopause in longitudinal studies.44 Reduced
levels of energy expenditure and muscle activity are the most
likely mechanisms to account for the results.
It is also possible that hysterectomy andaor oophorec-
tomy are more often performed in obese women than in
normal weight women.45 Obese women are more likely to be
at risk for the common indications for surgical menopause,
ie for endometriosis, ®broids and dysfunctional uterine
bleeding,46 which are estrogen-sensitive conditions. Obesity
is associated with higher exposure to endogenous estrogens
because of secondary conversion of androstenedione in fat
tissue and lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin.46
Studies are needed to sort out the nature of the relationship
between obesity and hysterectomyaoophorectomy.
Although the present study shows that menopausal status
was a signi®cant predictor of BMI, it is important to note
that a comparison of the relative effect sizes of the variables
indicates that menopausal status, hormone use and chrono-
logical age were of least importance. Physical activity was the
most important predictor in each ethnic group taken sepa-
rately, and in the full sample along with ethnicity. This
suggests that interventions designed to increase physical
activity in mid-life women are likely to be bene®cial.
Another contributor to the BMI of Caucasian women was
geographical variation. Women from the Detroit area had
greater BMI than those from other sites, whereas those from
Los Angeles were lower than those at other sites. This effect

was not due to regional differences in surgical menopause
status, hormone use, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking,
age or educational attainment, at least as measured in our
survey. Geographic variation in obesity is well documented
with higher rates of obesity in the northeast and south and
lower rates in the West.31 Among the unmeasured factors
likely to be important to the pattern of regional differences
are diet, attitudes toward weight and environments conducive
to lifetime exercise.
Study limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the
design, which prevents drawing ®rm conclusions about
antecedent and consequent events. For example, we know
from other studies that hormone users, including African-
American women19,20 are thinner prior to the use of
hormones, but women randomly assigned to estrogen
replacement therapy also experience smaller increases
in weight and central adiposity than those assigned to
placebo.16 ± 18,47 Our design cannot determine the direction
of effect of the variables measured in the study and obesity.
Second, the multiethnic nature of the study population is
a positive feature, but it still lacked African-Americans from
the south and Mexican Americans. Third, although BMI com-
parisons among women strati®ed by ethnicity can be made
in this study, further explorations of the interactions among
ethnic group, menopausal status, and hormone use are
dif®cult because of ethnic differences in hysterectomy
rates, decision to take hormones etc, resulting in small cell
counts for some of the ethnic groups, eg Chinese Americans
who had a surgical menopause or used hormones. Fourth,
weight adjusted for height is an often used, but crude
measure of adiposity and was based on self-reports in the
present paper. Thus, the BMI was subject to the well known,
but small bias to minimize weight and elevate height. We do
not think this is a large problem because of the substantial
covariation between self-reported and measured height and
weight in the present sample and in other studies.1,34,35
Follow-up of a subset of women who participated in the
original survey is now underway and will permit evaluation
of the relationships among obesity, central adiposity,
ethnicity and menopause in a longitudinal design with
veri®cation of hormonal and surgical status.
In summary, in a large multi-ethnic sample of middle-
aged women, we found that elevated BMI was associated
with surgical and perimenopausal status, and not using
hormones. Natural menopause, the cessation of menses for
12 months or more, was unrelated to elevated BMI in the
multivariate model. Ethnicity, geographical area (only in
Caucasians), and educational status were also related. A
powerful predictor of elevated BMI in the total sample and
within each ethnic group was physical inactivity, suggesting
that the most useful intervention for preventing weight gain
in mid-life women is increasing physical activity level.
