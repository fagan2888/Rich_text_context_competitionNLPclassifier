Abstract
Objective The purpose of the study was to examine the
association of temporal factors, in particular days of the
week and seasons of the year and death from suicide in the
United States.
Method Data were pooled from the Multiple Cause of
Death Files. Hierarchical logistic regression models were
fitted to all deaths occurring in 2000 through 2004 by
suicide.
Results The incidence of suicide was significantly higher
on Wednesdays, compared to Sunday. Specifically, indi-
viduals were 99% more likely to kill themselves on
Wednesday than on Sunday. Suicides were more prevalent
in the summer months, and they were less likely to occur in
winter. The state suicide rate significantly elevated indi-
vidual suicide risk. The results held even after controlling
for the potentially confounding effects of socio-economic
and demographic variables at both the individual and state
levels.
Conclusion It was concluded that the observed associa-
tion between seasonality and suicide cannot be discounted
as a mere coincidence. Future research ought to focus on
integrating individual level data and contextual variables
when testing for seasonality effects.

Introduction
Attempts to link the natural environment, especially tem-
poral characteristics to suicide have a long tradition in the
biomedical and social sciences. Some analysts report that
seasons influence affective disorders [19]. Others indicate
that cold and long winter nights increase suicide rates [78].
In many cultures, there is a popular belief that the weather,
seasons, and even lunar cycles may be associated with
suicide. As far back as 1842, Quetelet [64, p. 90] made a
case for a possible effect of the natural environment on
humans, pointing out that ``the seasons in their course,
exact a marked influence'' on human behavior.
Among earlier quantitative efforts to provide empirical
evidence in support of the impact of seasonality on suicide
was the work of Morselli [55]. He compiled suicide and
climatic data on 28 European countries in the late nine-
teenth century and observed that the seasonal regularity in
annual suicide statistics was ``too great for it to be attrib-
uted to chance of the human will'' (p. 120). Morselli [55]
indicated that the temperate part of Europe provided the
most favorable environment for suicide and that most
suicides took place during summer, with the fewest taking
place in winter. He was among the first to point out that
mood disorders could be influenced by the weather, con-
cluding, for example, that temperature increased suicide
risk by interfering with brain functions.
In his book Suicide, Durkheim [18] observed correlations
between suicide and day of the week and month of the year,
adding that these associations displayed certain similarities
of form and origin. He generalized that suicide is higher in
the first part of new periods (e.g., start of the week), and
lower at the end of new periods (e.g., end of the week). In
addition, Durkheim [18] found that most suicides occurred
in the afternoon. In accounting for these findings, however,

he discounted the role of climatic and temporal factors,
indicating that ``to explain it one could certainly not refer to
the action of the sun and the temperature'' (p. 117). He
proposed instead that sociological variables mediated the
relationship between the temporal associations and suicide.
As he put it, the environmental explanation ``...being dis-
carded, we have but one other possible, namely, that day
favors suicide because this is time of most active existence,
when human relations cross and recross, when social life is
most intense...Whatever information is available to us as to
how suicide is distributed among the different hours of the
day or the different days of the week confirms this view'' (p.
117). Durkheim also reported that most suicides occurred in
the spring, not summer. To explain this observation, he once
again downplayed the role of the natural environment, and
went instead for a sociological explanation. According to
him, most suicides took place in spring because ``everything
begins to awake; activity is resumed, relations spring up,
interchanges increase.'' (p. 119). In other words, it is the
density of human interactions, and not the environment that
caused higher incidence of suicide in spring. Thus, although
[18] examined the role of cosmic factors in the etiology of
suicide, he moved away from attributing direct association
with them. In his view, the natural environment had no
direct bearing on the incidence of suicide, which he felt
depended on social conditions and the intensity of human
interactions, or what Massing and Angermeyer [51] have
described as the varying intensity of social life. Thus, sui-
cide was not a direct result of physical or climatic
conditions.
More contemporary quantitative studies on the rela-
tionship between temporal variables and suicide, however,
have produced a major puzzle. Some investigators have
reported associations between seasonality and suicide [7,
10, 16, 34, 41, 46]. Lambert et al. [41] noted that the
incidence of suicide in southeastern Australia shows a clear
seasonal pattern. They found that suicides peak during
spring and summer months, indicating a positive associa-
tion between suicide incidents and prevailing sunlight
levels. In contrast, Edwards and Whitlock [21] found a
spring peak in the number of suicides committed in Bris-
bane, Australia, but the results were not statistically sig-
nificant. Dublin [16] reported that the incidence of suicide
varied according to seasons in the northern hemisphere, but
contrary results were found for the southern hemisphere.
Landau and Fridman [43, p. 164] affirmed that ``Much of
previous research on this topic has produced inconsistent
and contradictory findings.'' For example, although Rotton
[68] observed a significant relationship between winter
months (December, January, and February) and suicide, the
signs were in the negative direction, a finding that con-
tradicts those reported by Barraclough [4], Gabennesch
[22], and Kevan [33]. In a 2007 study of suicide counts in
England and Wales, Page et al. [59, p. 109] contradicted
many prior findings of a spring or summer peak in suicide
deaths, noting instead that most suicides occur in January
(winter). A review of 27 quantitative studies by Deisen-
hammer [14] reported that much of the literature on sea-
sonality and suicide is contradictory.
Past research
Most researchers who have identified an association
between seasonality and suicide found a peak during the
spring or summer [31, 60]. Petridou et al. [60] conducted a
study that involved 20 countries and found an early sum-
mer peak. They concluded that the seasonal variation in
suicide incidence could be explained by the increase in
sunshine in summer months. A relationship between sun-
shine, high temperatures and suicide rate has since been
supported by other studies as well [44, 59, 62]. Yet
Deisenhammer's [14] review of the existing literature
found that most studies failed to control for potentially
confounding variables, a situation that seriously calls into
question the validity of some claims. Further, adding to the
controversy are findings with regard to sex differences in
the seasonal distribution of suicides [5, 65]. Several
investigators have found that the seasonal suicide incidence
has one peak in spring for men and a bimodal peak, one in
spring and one in autumn, for women [23, 53]. However,
one peak in spring or summer, regardless of sex differ-
ences, has been found in the United States [45] and Taiwan
[44].
At the cross-national level, researchers have found evi-
dence in support of the influence of season, climate, month,
and week on intentional violence. Kok [35] reported a
strong relationship between climatic variables such as
temperature, wind speed, rainfall and humidity and suicide
in Singapore. Using regression analysis in France, Souetre
et al. [73] noted that among all the variables analyzed, the
main factors affecting the regional distribution of suicide
were ambient temperature and sunlight duration.
In a study based on the US population, MacMahon [50]
analyzed 129,621 US suicides recorded between 1972 and
1978. He found that in each year, suicides peaked in late
spring and dropped in winter. In each month, suicides
peaked on the fifth day and dropped until the end of the
month. In terms of days, MacMahon [50] reported that
suicides peaked on Monday and dropped to weekend lows.
In a replication of the MacMahon [50] study, McCleary
et al. [52] found support for the effects of days of the week,
but no support was found for months on suicide rates in the
United States. In the years following these studies, there
has been relatively little research on the relationship
between day of the week and suicide in the United States.

season of the year, especially summer had an impact on
rape, theft, and other forms of violence, but not on suicide.
Maldonado and Kraus [49] studied suicides committed in
Sacramento County, California between 1925 and 1983
and found that the occurrence of suicide varied substan-
tially by time of day, with the fewest taking place between
4:00 and 8:00 a.m. They reported, however, that suicides
were most frequent on Monday, and this held true for both
males and females, regardless of age. They observed no
significant finding with regard to month or lunar phase.
Maldonado and Kraus [49] also remarked that suicides
occur at an almost equal frequency during the seasons.
Other works on the relationship between temporal fac-
tors and suicide have been done by Hassan [24] and Stack
[74]. Hassan [24] used death registration data on 19,525
suicides recorded in Australia between 1981 and 1990 to
study the impact of moon phase, day of the week, month of
the year, and season. According to Hassan [24, p. 89], the
highest incidence of suicide for both men and women was
on Mondays, a finding consistent with those of Maldonado
and Kraus [49]. With regard to seasons, however, Hassan
contradicted findings by Maldonado and Kraus and
affirmed that in Australia, suicides do vary according to
seasons. For both men and women, the highest incidence of
suicide in Australia tended to occur in the spring. With
regard to lunar phases, Hassan [24, p. 89] observed ``that
except for the Full Moon Day, the average daily suicide in
various lunar phases varies only slightly.'' He noted that
the mean suicide for the Full Moon Day was higher than
the daily mean in different lunar phases.
Stack [74] retested Gabennesch's argument that tem-
poral factors affect suicide because of an unfavorable
contrast between raised expectations and reality. According
to Gabennesch [22] weekends, holidays, and new seasons
raise expectations for a better mood. They also offer hope
for a new and better beginning at the end of the holiday,
week, or season. If these raised expectations are not ful-
filled, the suicidal individual may feel deprived and
depressed, and may subsequently destroy himself/herself
[22]. In short, disappointments, resulting from unfulfilled
expectations explain higher suicides on certain days (as
opposed to others), and in certain months (as opposed to
others). In re-testing the above ideas, Stack [74, p. 318]
found that suicides peak in the spring months (March,
April, and May).
Some scholars report that the seasonality of suicides has
decreased or even vanished in recent years [58, 71, 80].
Oravecz et al. [58] compared data on suicides in Slovenia
from 1983 to 1993 with suicides that occurred from 1994 to
1998 and found that the seasonal influence on suicide
present prior to 1994 had disappeared. Yip et al. [80]
studied the suicide incidence in England and Wales
between 1982 and 1996 and found that although the sea-
sonal variation in suicide rate present in England and
Wales in the 1960s and 1970s had not vanished, it had
greatly decreased. A recent multicentre study in England
and Wales [26] observed temporal patterns of self-harm,
with diurnal variations in time of presentation to hospital
peaking between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. That investi-
gation was, however, limited to deliberate self-harm and
did not include completed suicides. In addition, no effort
was made by the authors to control for day of the week or
season.
As the foregoing review has shown that several analysts
have found either no relationship between temporal vari-
ables and suicide, or have reported conflicting findings [4,
33, 57, 59]. As Kevan [33, p. 368­369] remarks, ``It must
be pointed out to all those who are interested in man's
seasonal behavior that there is little likelihood of finding
any clear-cut relationship between atmospheric conditions
and human behavior...Man's reactions are not going to be
easy to understand, and so, there is no reason to expect an
early resolution to the socio-economic/biometeorological
debate on suicide.''
The present study offers an opportunity to reexamine the
association between temporal factors and suicide with the
aim of resolving some of the inconsistencies in the existing
literature. An added advantage of the present analysis over
previous ones is the use of a nationally representative
sample, and the entire universe of suicide deaths occurring
in the United States. To increase statistical power, and to
avoid drawing false inferences based on unexpected yearly
fluctuations, we pool data for 5 years, 2000­2004. Finally,
hierarchical models are specified.
The present study employs a multi-level approach to
investigate the association of temporal factors and suicide
risk. The response variable is suicide risk measured at the
individual level. The predictor variables are measured at
both level 1 (individual) and level 2 (US state). A
number of research questions are addressed: (1) Are days
of the week associated with suicide? (2) Are seasons of
the year related to suicide? (3) Do states with high sui-
cide rates influence individual suicide risk? (4) Do
observed daily and seasonal patterns in suicide risk hold
for Whites and Non-Whites? (5) What are the implica-
tions of answers to the above questions for past and
future research?
Analytical strategy
In multi-level data with a categorical response variable, it
is desirable to use a hierarchical generalized linear mod-
eling technique that incorporates a unique random effect
into the equation for each higher level observation. This

approach produces more robust standard errors than those
produced via techniques that do not allow nested models
[66]. In contextual analysis, dependence may arise because
individuals within a given level 2 unit for example, the
state, have shared experiences and expectations. In short,
persons within a state may have more in common with
their state citizens than with individuals residing in other
states. The situation is similar to `design effect' issues that
arise in complex surveys due to clustering of observations,
and hence the need to obtain robust standard errors by
applying appropriate variance estimation techniques. In
multi-level models with binary outcomes, therefore, cal-
culated standard errors must adjust for the variability in
random effects [66]. In the present analysis, the GLIM-
MIX procedure in SAS 9.2 [69] was used to estimate
parameters.
Hierarchical modeling approaches are rare in the suicide
literature in general. A search of PUBMED (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [61] and Sociological Abstracts (http://
www.csa.com) [72] covering the past 2 decades produced
none that used the approach in the investigation of the link
between temporal factors (seasonality) and suicide. Multi-
level techniques have appeared only recently in suicide
research, including that by van Tubergen et al. [77], and by
Stack and Kposowa [75]. Van Tubergen et al. [77] exam-
ined completed suicides, while Stack and Kposowa [75]
studied suicide acceptability at the cross-national level.
The multi-level or mixed modeling approach recognizes
the fact that most individual events do not occur in a
vacuum, but are located in time and space. Thus, just as
individual characteristics can have effects on the odds of
suicide, contextual factors can also affect individual odds.
Past studies have reported that suicide attempters have
generally had more contact with role models that have
committed suicide [3]. As Stack and Kposowa [75, p. 41]
observe, in communities with more persons that have died
of suicide, there could be greater interaction with individ-
uals that have attitudes favorable to suicide. This study
recognizes the possibility of the complex relationship
between macro structural factors and micro characteristics
by modeling individuals as located in their states of resi-
dence, taking into account that some of the individual risk
factors may be due to state differences.
Methods
Data
The data used in the study were derived from the national
US Multiple Cause of Death Files (MCDFs) for 2000­
2004 [56]. The MCDFs contain mortality statistics based
on the information from death certificate records of all
deaths occurring in the United States. The information is
received on computer data tapes coded by the States and
provided to the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program,
or are coded by NCHS staff from copies of the original
certificates received from registration areas. NCHS
receives the data for the MCD Files from the registration
offices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New
York City. Mortality data for the United States are limited
to deaths occurring within the country to US residents and
nonresidents. Deaths occurring to US citizens outside the
United States are not included in the MCDF [56]. A more
detailed description of the MCDFs has been presented
elsewhere [56].
The current analysis focused on suicide deaths among
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic African Americans,
non-Hispanic Native Americans (American Indians), non-
Hispanic Asians, and Hispanics aged 18 years and above.
The results presented are based on those adults 18 years
old and above who died of suicide in their state of resi-
dence in the years 2000 (24,279), 2001 (25,315), 2002
(28,944), 2003 (26,202) and 2004 (26,896).
Dependent variable
The MCDF is cross-sectional, and lacks population
denominators. Therefore, a case­control design was
employed in this study. The response variable was the odds
of death by suicide (the cases), as opposed to deaths from
natural causes (the controls). The data used do not permit a
comparison of victims versus non-victims (those still
alive), so the `non-victims' in the analysis are those who
died of natural causes. Deaths resulting from suicide were
defined according to the Tenth Revision of the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases [ICD-10] [79], with the
underlying cause codes X64 to X87.0. All suicides to
persons age 18 and above (cases) were coded 1. Persons
dying of natural causes (after eliminating homicides and
accidents) were coded 0 and used as controls. Like the
suicides, analysis was limited to individuals dying in their
current state of residence. Due to serious technical diffi-
culties encountered (computer memory problems, conver-
gence problems, etc.) in analyzing all deaths from natural
causes (nearly 10 million) a 20% simple random sample
was selected for each year studied. The deaths for all
5 years were then pooled into one concatenated file. The
resulting deaths from natural causes per year (after sam-
pling) were as follows: 369,023 (in 2000), 370,628
(in 2001), 429,099 (in 2002), 377,029 (in 2003), and
368,504 (in 2004). In all, there were 131,636 suicides, and
1,914,283 sampled deaths from natural sources. Thus, the
effective sample size at the individual level comprised
2,045,919 cases.

Individual level variables
Day of the week was treated as a series of dummy variables
with one each for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-
day, Friday, and Saturday. Sunday was treated as the ref-
erence category for comparison. To measure season, we
collapsed the 12 months in the calendar year into autumn
(September, October, and November), spring (March,
April, and May), and summer (comprising the months
June, July, and August). The reference group was winter
(December, January, and February). Owing to the fact that
the data were pooled from deaths occurring in five different
years, period effects might be present. It is conceivable that
any single year is atypical and that the number of suicides
may be affected by extraneous national and even interna-
tional events. To control for period effects as well as
possible trends in the data, analysis employed year of death
as an independent variable. The variable was measured as a
series of dummy variables. There was one each for 2001,
2002, 2003, and 2004. The year 2000 was the reference
category for comparison purposes.
Studies in the United States consistently show that there
are substantial disparities in rates and risks of suicide by
race/ethnicity [11, 30, 38, 40]. Racial differences in suicide
have also been reported in South Africa, with whites
experiencing much higher rates than Blacks, Coloureds or
Asians in major South African cities [9]. It has also been
suggested that seasonality might affect non-whites and
whites differently [7, 54, 74]. The present report, therefore,
controlled for race/ethnicity. The variable comprised non-
Hispanic African Americans, non-Hispanic native Ameri-
cans, non-Hispanic Asians, and Hispanics. Each of these
groups was coded 1, and non-Hispanic Whites were used as
the reference category. Marital status has figured promi-
nently in many studies as a significant predictor of suicide
and parasuicide [13, 15, 25, 29]. The covariate was mea-
sured by a set of dummy variables, with one each for
single, widowed, separated, or divorced. Those married at
the time of death constituted the reference category. Per-
sons with missing marital status information were deleted
from the analysis. Age at death was captured by leaving it
in its interval form. For sex, females were the omitted
group. Both age and sex were included as demographic
control variables. The MCDF lacks many socioeconomic
variables. Education, the only one collected in all states
was used as a control variable. The covariate was left in its
format as highest grade completed. The data contained a
large number of missing cases, so the mean value (high
school education) was substituted for persons with missing
information. City size of residence was left in its ordinal
format. Inclusion of city size is important for reassessing
findings in some recent studies that rural areas have sig-
nificantly higher suicide rates than urban areas [32, 63].
State level variables
The main level 2 variable was the state suicide rate. Its
inclusion was based on the reasoning that high suicides in a
state increase not only awareness of suicide, but attitudes
favorable to suicidal behavior. As Stack and Kposowa [75,
p. 41] explain, ``In a community with a high suicide rate,
there are proportionately more persons committing suicide
and, hence, more cases that offer excuses for suicide.'' The
variable was measured as the number of suicides per
100,000 resident population in 1999. The second level 2
variable was physician supply, measured as the number of
physicians per 100,000 population in 2000. Utilization of
the variable in this research was informed by past eco-
logical studies that have shown a relationship between
availability of primary care physicians and both morbidity
and mortality [6, 70]. The unemployment rate was mea-
sured as the percent of the civilian labor force that was
unemployed in 2000. Unemployment has been used
extensively in suicide research with mixed results [27]. The
present study offers an opportunity to ascertain its associ-
ation with suicide in a multi-level framework. Divorce was
measured as divorces per 1,000 resident population in
2000. The variable has been generally used as an indicator
of social integration or social fragmentation [8, 12, 20, 25,
36, 38]. Both percent college educated, 2000 and the Gini
Index of income inequality, 2000 were used as socioeco-
nomic controls. Higher values on Gini (which ranges from
0 to 1) indicate higher income inequality and thus higher
relative deprivation. With regard to region, we divided the
US into West and non-Western States, with non-West used
as reference. The rationale for this classification was based
on research in sociological science that finds Western states
consistently having the highest suicide rates than the rest of
the country [8, 36, 38]. Western states were limited to
California, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.
Results
Descriptive findings
Figure 1 presents descriptive results on pooled suicides by
day of the week covering the period 2000­2004 inclusive.
The highest percentage of suicides occurred on Wednesday
(24.6%). The percentages dropped suddenly on Thursday
(11.1%), Friday (11.2%), and Sunday (11.8%). Suicides
then rose to 12.7% on Tuesday, 14.3% on Monday, and
14.4% on Saturday. On the whole, descriptive statistics
showed a single suicide peak on Wednesday and the lowest
point on Thursday (11.1%). Thursday and Friday were the
days with the fewest suicides in the 5 years of data
combined.

Figure 2 shows graphic results with regard to seasons
and suicide. As may be seen, 26% of all suicides took place
in summer, and 25.8% occurred in spring. Autumn months
posted 24.4% and the lowest incidence was in the winter
(23.8%). On the whole, the descriptive results seem to
suggest that suicides are highest in the summer months,
followed closely by months in winter.
Multivariate findings
The remainder of the analysis focuses on examining the
association between days and seasons and the odds of
suicide, taking into account the association of other vari-
ables. Table 1 presents hierarchical logistic regression
results showing the effects of days and season on suicide in
2000 through 2004. As may be seen, the estimated effects
are generally in agreement with the descriptive findings
shown earlier in Figs. 1 and 2. With regard to days of the
week, the Wednesday effect on suicide was much stronger
than that observed for any other day. Individuals were a
little over 99% ([OR - 1] 9 100) more likely to kill
themselves on Wednesday than on Sunday. They were over
55% as likely to kill themselves on Monday as on Sunday
(OR 1.556, CI 1.519, 1.598), and suicides were 62% more
likely to take place on Tuesday than on Sunday (OR 1.623,
CI 1.581, 1.667). Individuals were also nearly 1.5 times as
likely to have died of suicide on Thursday as on Sunday,
and the odds of suicide were 26% more elevated on Friday

than on Sunday. Persons were 58% more likely to suicide
on Saturday than on Sunday (OR 1.583, CI 1.543, 1.625).
As for seasons of the year, results show that suicides
were a little over 19% as likely to occur in summer as in
winter (OR 1.193, CI 1.171­1.216). They were 15% more
likely to take place in spring (OR 1.153, CI 1.132­1.174)
than in winter, and they were nearly 11% as likely to occur
in summer as in winter (OR 1.106, CI 1.086­1.127). When
year of death was considered, findings revealed no con-
sistent trends in death. The year 2001 was barely signifi-
cant, although the regression coefficient was in the positive
direction (OR 1.028, CI 1.006­1.050). Suicides were 5.6%
less likely to take place in 2002 than in 2000. There was no
significant difference in risk between 2003 and 2000, but in
2004 the risk of suicide mortality was nearly 10% more
elevated than in 2000 (OR 1.097, CI 1.074­1.120).
Consistent with prior research, males were over 2.9 times
more likely to commit suicide than their female counter-
parts (OR 2.926, CI 2.880­2.972). When race/ethnicity was
considered, African Americans, American Indians, Asians,
and Hispanics all had much lower risks of suicide than
whites, with African Americans showing especially lower
risk (OR 0.258, CI 0.251­0.265). Divorced persons were
38% more likely to commit suicide than the married.
Single/never married persons exhibited lower suicide risk
than the married, but widowed persons experienced a sui-
cide risk that was over 1.4 times that of married persons.
Education elevated suicide risk (OR 1.077, CI 1.073­
1.080). Findings further show that individuals living in
metropolitan areas were less likely to kill themselves than
their counterparts living outside metro areas (OR 0.965, CI
0.958­0.971). In a similar manner, the greater the size of the
city of residence, the lower the suicide risk.
We turn next to level 2 results, which are also shown in
Table 1. As may be observed in the table, the state suicide
rate elevated individual risk of dying from suicide (OR
1.042, CI 1.036­1.047). Greater supply of physician
resources in a state significantly reduced individual suicide
risk (OR 0.998, CI 0.997­0.998). The state unemployment
rate was not significantly associated with suicide, but the
divorce rate elevated individual suicide risk, although by a
very small margin. The higher the percentage of college
educated persons in a state, the higher the individual sui-
cide risk (OR 1.023, CI 1.019­1.027). The state Gini
Coefficient had a marginal effect on individual suicide risk,
but in the negative direction. There was no significant
difference between Western and non-Western states in
individual suicide risk. Finally, the variance of the random
state intercepts on the logit scale (r2
s
¼ 0:0006) was sta-
tistically significant, suggesting the existence of state dif-
ferentials in individual odds of suicide.
One of the research questions posed in the introduction
was to address whether there are racial/ethnic differences
regarding the impact of seasonality on suicide. Due to the
reduced number of suicides, the various non-White groups
were combined for comparison with non-Hispanic whites.
Relevant results are presented in Table 2. The first three
columns show results for Whites and the last three columns
have findings for non-Whites.
As may be seen in the table, the daily effects were rel-
atively similar in both groups. Among Whites, the peak in
suicides was on Wednesday when the odds ratio was 1.98
(CI 1.94­2.03). Among non-Whites, Wednesday was also
the peak in suicides, but with a slightly stronger odds ratio
(2.06, CI 1.96­2.20). In the non-White group, individuals
were 93% more likely to die from suicide on Saturday than
on Sunday (OR 1.93, CI 1.81­2.05). In the White group,
however, the second weekly peak was not Saturday, but
Tuesday, when the suicide risk was 61% more elevated
than on Sunday.
When seasons were considered, spring was a clear
suicide peak for Whites (OR 1.43, CI 1.12­1.17), but for

non-Whites, suicides tended to peak in summer followed
closely by spring. Indeed, the seasonal distribution appears
more evenly distributed among non-Whites than Whites.
Year of death exhibited slightly divergent patterns in the
two groups. For instance, year 2001 elevated suicide risk in
whites, but not in non-whites. Similarly, year 2003
increased suicide risk in non-whites, but the covariate did
not reach statistical significance among whites; indeed, it
was in the negative direction. The only consistent yearly
effect in Whites and non-Whites was 2004 when both
groups experienced much higher suicide odds than in 2000.
White males were nearly 2.8 times more likely to die of
suicide than white females, and non-White males were 3.2
times as likely to die of suicide as their non-White female
counterparts. While divorce increased the risk of suicide in
Whites (OR 1.42, CI 1.40­1.45), it had no significant effect
in the non-White group.
When level 2 variables were examined, findings showed
that the state suicide rate increased suicide risk in Whites
and non-Whites alike. Physician supply reduced the risk of
suicide in both groups. While the state unemployment rate
had no significant association with suicide among Whites, in
non-Whites the association was statistically significant (OR
1.05, CI 1.05­1.09). The state divorce rate was barely sig-
nificant, but positive in the White sample, it was negatively
associated with suicide in the non-White sample (OR 0.87,
CI 0.82­0.92). Likewise, while the Gini Index of income
inequality did not reach statistical significance in Whites, it
was very strongly related to suicide in the non-White group
(OR 0.01, CI 0.01­0.01). Western states did not signifi-
cantly predict suicide for Whites, but they elevated suicide
odds among non-Whites (OR 1.21, CI 1.07­1.37).
Discussion
Several research questions were posed at the beginning of
this paper. The first two have been unequivocally answered
by the data analysis. Results have shown both significant
daily and significant seasonal variations in suicide. Sui-
cides are more likely to occur in summer and spring and
significantly less likely in fall and winter. This is consistent
with numerous recent studies that have reported a suicide
peak in spring or summer [31, 44, 60, 62]. Results from the
data analysis challenge some previous studies [68] that
reported an inverse relationship between temperature and
suicide, because such a relationship implies that higher
suicide deaths occur in winter and autumn and lower deaths
take place in spring and summer. Results also challenge
findings of a recent study [27] that emphatically stated that
suicides peak in winter. In the present study, the highest
peak was observed in summer.
As far as daily distributions are concerned, findings in
this study reveal that suicides are concentrated on
Wednesday. This may well be the first US study to dem-
onstrate a Wednesday suicide peak. Past work has found
Monday as the peak day. Given that Wednesday, not
Monday was observed as the day with the highest suicide
occurrence, results are at odds with Durkheim's [18]
observation that suicides are higher at the beginning of new
periods. Results reported here disconfirm research in the
United States by Maldonado and Kraus [49] and in Aus-
tralia by Hassan [24] that found most suicides occurring on
Monday. Findings are also at odds with those noted by Page
et al. [59] for the United Kingdom that suicides took place
most often in winter, notably in January. Indeed, Page et al.
[59, p. 109] expressly stated that their study did not support
prior findings of a spring or summer peak in suicide. While
Maldonado and Kraus [49] reported mixed results regarding
months of the year (seasons), in the present study, a clear
pattern emerged, with suicides peaking in summer.
While the effects of days and seasons on suicide should
not be interpreted as climatic or environmental determin-
ism, they do highlight periods when people are significantly
more likely to be victimized. Thus, at the clinical level, the
present research is important in the behavioral sciences
(e.g., psychology, psychiatry, social work, counseling, and
applied sociology). Knowledge of day or season when

suicides are more likely to happen can possibly help clini-
cians and therapists in advising patients and potential vic-
tims when they present themselves with depressive and
associated symptoms. A clinician could become more
proactive, whether through medication or advice, thereby
intervening to prevent death.
In view of the finding that most suicides tend to occur on
Wednesday compared to other days of the week, and that
the likelihood of death is also highest in summer, compared
to winter, the question may be asked as to whether psy-
chosocial problems are especially more pernicious on
Wednesday, compared to say, Weekends, or in summer,
compared to Winter. If psychological and certain social
problems are significantly more likely to be experienced on
Wednesday, then future research could try to disentangle
what these problems are, with the view to partialling out
their link to Wednesday.
It is plausible that the finding with regard to season is due
to co-morbidity. Some past studies [47], and to some extent
popular folklore in many cultures allude to winter months as
likely to have higher levels of suicide. Reasons for this are
generally given in terms of winter months having less
sunshine on average, and thus raising the stakes for condi-
tions such as depression, anxiety, affective disorders,
greater suicide ideation, and thus suicidal behavior [78].
Another tack in this regard is that two major `family' hol-
idays (Christmas and the New Year) take place in the winter
(at least in the western hemisphere). Winter holidays are
viewed as being especially stressful for persons who lack
social support due to absence of significant others (family,
friends, spouses, and other loved ones). According to co-
morbidity arguments [14], the incidence of depression,
anxiety, seasonal affective disorder, and other psychiatric
conditions may be especially high during winter and
therefore, suicide risks and rates would be high. Research
has shown, however, that a condition such as seasonal
affective disorder occurs during autumn and winter [14].
The finding here and in other studies that suicides peak in
summer and spring challenges any view of seasonal affec-
tive disorder having an effect on the seasonality of suicides.
The argument about the concentration of many psychi-
atric and psychological disorders in winter having been
discarded in the present study, could it be, for example, that
social integration, as proposed by Durkheim is actually
much higher in winter than in summer? After all, despite the
less sunny weather in winter, people may spend more time
at home, with family and friends. With increasing tech-
nology, perhaps, they also spend more time on the tele-
phone, computers, and other entertainment gadgets when
the weather gets bad. In an information age (cell phones,
emails, and other instant means of communication), phys-
ical separation need not necessarily imply complete lack of
social support or networking. Thus, the mere fact of cold
weather (in the winter) should not be assumed as bringing a
reduction in social ties, or as promoting depression and
higher suicidal behavior. Disentangling the various ideas
raised here presents a clear research challenge in the quest
to increase more fully our knowledge of the link between
temporal factors and suicide.
For suicide research on seasonality to advance and
become more consistent, investigators may need to make
greater use of multi-level designs. Events which are fre-
quently viewed as individual behavior may also be influ-
enced by contextual factors. In the present study, state
suicide rates significantly affected individual's suicide
behavior. How to explain this finding?
Consistent with social learning and differential associ-
ation theories of deviant behavior [1­3, 76], persons living
in states or localities with high suicide rates may have
higher exposure to definitions favorable to suicide accep-
tance, and this in turn may increase their odds of com-
mitting suicide. Prevailing social, economic, and even
political conditions in a state may further affect individ-
ual's suicidal behavior by maintaining an environment in
which people's aspirations are thwarted and dreams of a
better tomorrow are deferred.
With regard to racial/ethnic differences, Stack [74, p.
321] reported that white suicides peak on Monday, adding
that there were 8.25 additional suicides on Mondays,
compared to Sundays, and that Saturday was the trough in
white suicides. Likewise, McIntosh and Lester [54] found
that white and black suicides peaked on Mondays, although
the peak was less pronounced for Blacks. Data analysis for
this study failed to find support for Stack's [74] contention
of white suicides peaking on Monday, or McIntosh and
Lester's [54] suggestion of both white and black suicides
also peaking on Monday. Analysis has clearly shown that
for white suicides, Wednesday is the peak. Although
Blacks were not specifically studied, and they were lumped
with other minority groups, findings here have shown that
non-White suicides also peaked on Wednesday, followed
not by Monday, but by Saturday. In contrary to Stack's
[74] report, the trough in white suicides in the present study
was not Saturday, but Friday. The trough in non-White
suicides was also on Friday.
A consistent and notable finding is that divorce places a
person at an especially high risk of becoming a suicide
victim. How to interpret the divorce findings? Sociologist
Durkheim [18] informed us a century ago that a breakdown
in social integration through divorce is a crisis and a pro-
foundly stressful life event. This is now a well-documented
observation in mental health, health psychology, psy-
chosomatic medicine, and family therapy [25, 48, 65].
Separated and divorced individuals have been found to be
over-represented in the psychiatric patient population, for
instance. Separated people are more likely to be involved
Soc Psychiat Epidemiol (2010) 45:433­445 443
123
in automobile accidents than non-separated people [39].
Marital separation, as opposed to non-separation, is asso-
ciated with higher rates of illness and disability as well as
high death rates due to suicide, homicide, and other causes
of mortality [37, 67]. Findings from this study confirm
once again that divorce is a non-trivial risk factor for sui-
cide at both the individual and contextual levels.
Findings confirm that there are still significant rural­
urban differences in suicide risk in that metropolitan areas
experienced lower risks than non-metropolitan areas.
Results are consistent with those reported in recent
research [32, 38, 63].
Commenting on the on rural­urban differentials in sui-
cide risk, Kposowa [38] argued that completed suicides may
be influenced by emergency response services and the
existence of nearby trauma centers. Simply put, in localities
with rapid emergency response, timely arrival at the scene
of a suicide event could make the difference between life
and death. In general, emergency response services as well
as trauma centers are more likely to be concentrated in large
urban centers than in smaller cities or rural areas. Implicit in
this argument is that at some point in American history,
urban areas might have experienced much higher suicide
rates than rural areas, but with advances in technology,
especially communication and transportation centered in
metropolitan areas, there has been a gradual shift in suicide
occurrence that disadvantages rural communities [17, 28].
In general, results showed that climatic factors should
not be discounted in efforts to explain suicide. In this
regard, results support Morselli's [55] admonition that the
regularity observed between season and suicide may be too
great for it to be attributed to chance of the human will.
