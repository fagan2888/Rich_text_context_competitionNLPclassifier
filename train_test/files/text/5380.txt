Abstract
Apparent biological motion is the perception of plausible movements when two alternating
images depicting the initial and final phase of an action are presented at specific stimulus onset
asynchronies. Here, we show lower subjective apparent biological motion perception when actions
are observed from a first relative to a third visual perspective. These findings are discussed within
the context of sensorimotor contributions to body ownership.

Apparent biological motion (ABM; Shiffrar & Freyd, 1990) allows investigating how the
visual system processes observed body movements (Funk, Shiffrar, & Brugger, 2005;
Vannuscorps & Caramazza, 2016). Images taken from a third person perspective (3PP)
have been typically used, and recent studies with immersive systems investigated action
observation and action monitoring mechanisms in first person perspective (1PP; Padrao,
Gonzalez-Franco, Sanchez-Vives, Slater, & Rodriguez-Fornells, 2016; Pavone et al., 2016).
To date, the role of 1PP in ABM task has not been assessed.
Thirteen healthy right-handed volunteers wore an Head Mounted Display (Oculus DK1)
and observed two avatars (Alvarez et al., 2011; Orvalho, Bastos, Parke, Oliveira, & Alvarez,
2012): from a 1PP and a 3PP (Figure 1(a)). Participants assessed the plausibility of the

perceived ABM (through vs. above an obstacle) for the right index and little finger, in two
separate blocks, by pressing two buttons with the middle and ring finger of the left hand. The
initial and final positions of the fingers were presented for 90 ms and five stimulus onset
asynchronies (SOAs) (100, 400, 700, 1,000, and 1,300 ms; Funk et al., 2005) gradually
increased the perception of seeing the finger moving along a trajectory above an obstacle
(Figure 1(a)). Two finger movements enabled to verify the generalizability of the results and
describe any possible role of motor dexterity on visual perception (i.e., index finger
movements are more familiar than little finger actions; Plata Bello, Modron
~ o, Marcano, &
Gonza
´ lez-Mora, 2013; Plata Bello, Modron
~ o, Marcano, & Gonza
´ lez-Mora, 2015). Blocks
order and response buttons were almost counterbalanced across subjects. There were 80 trials
for each block (8 trials for each SOA-Finger interaction; 40 for 1PP; 40 for 3PP). Participants
were allowed to watch the stimuli for as long as needed, and ``perceived ABM'' was collected
(i.e., plausible ABM ``I perceived the finger as moving over the obstacle'' vs. implausible
ABM ``I perceived the finger as moving through the obstacle''). No visible movements
of subjects' right fingers were noted during the experiment. After each block participants
verbally rated on a 7-point rating scale their agreement with a set of questions
(À3 ¼ completely disagree, 0 ¼ neither agree nor disagree, 3 ¼ completely agree; see
Figure 1(b)) in order to control illusory sensations over the virtual bodies.
Binary ABM answers were analyzed using logistic-GLMER mixed effects regression in
``lme4'' package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2016; R Development Core Team,
2013) with Perspective, SOA, and Finger as fixed effects. Ratings were analyzed using
Cumulative Linear Mixed Model (CLMM) in ``ordinal'' package (Christensen, 2015) with
Perspective and Finger as fixed effects. For all multilevel analyses, a by-subjects random
intercept was included, and the saturated model (i.e., the model with all the available fixed
parameters, factors, and interactions) was simplified by hierarchically dropping effects and
interactions with p > .1. For the sake of simplicity, we report only the parameters of the final
best-fitting model by considering both Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information
criterion, and the log likelihood indexes.
Plausible ABM (i.e., above the obstacle) was affected by SOA (p < .001, Figure 1(c)),
Perspective (p < .001, 45.1% for 1PP vs. 57.6% for 3PP). A trend to significance for Finger
(p ¼ .053) indicated a lower tendency to report plausible ABM (i.e., ``above'') for the index
(49.5%) relative to the little finger (53.3%). This was accounted for by a significant
Perspective Â Finger interaction with a lower rate of plausible ABM for Index-1PP relative
to all other conditions (all p < .001) and Index-3PP relative to Little-1PP (p ¼ .011, Figure 1(d)).
Finally, participants experienced full-body-ownership and perceived control (Tieri,
Tidoni, Pavone, & Aglioti, 2015a) over the observed movements (Tieri, Tidoni, Pavone, &
Aglioti, 2015b) as compared with control questions (all p < .001, Figure 1(f) to (h)).
Importantly, participants embodied only the virtual hand observed in 1PP compared to
the hand in 3PP and to control questions (p < .001, Figure 1(g)).
Overall, the present data indicate that ABM perception may be affected by perspective and
motor dexterity. That lower ABM was experienced only for the index in 1PP suggests a
combined role of motor familiarity (Plata Bello et al., 2013, 2015) and embodiment over
ABM perception. Crucially, participants were less prone to report a plausible ``above'' ABM
when the action was observed from a 1PP, and further studies are necessary to disentangle the
role of visual perspective from body ownership and the perceived control over the observed
movements from a 1PP (Tieri et al., 2015b; Wegner, Sparrow, & Winerman, 2004). Virtual
reality represents a useful tool to test the role of bodily re-afferences and sensorimotor brain
areas responsible of motion/action perception during perceptual judgments (Orgs et al., 2016;
