Abstract
Objective: To explore the association between vitamin B12
(B12
)-containing
supplement use, low B12
concentrations and biochemically defined B12
deficiency
in US adults.
Design: A cross-sectional study with adjustment for survey design. Prevalence
ratios for two age groups (18­50 and .50 years) were estimated using uncon-
ditional logistic models. Outcome measures included prevalence of low serum
B12
concentration (,148 pmol/l) and biochemical B12
deficiency (serum
B12
, 148 pmol/l with concomitant homocysteine . 10 mmol/l).
Setting: A population survey of health and nutritional measures.
Subjects: Subjects were non-institutionalized adults, aged 18 years and older, who
participated in Phase 2 of NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey).
Results: Low B12
concentrations were less prevalent among persons consuming
B12
-containing supplements (P 5 0?001) with an adjusted prevalence ratio of 0?6
(95 % CI 0?3, 1?0). Biochemical B12
deficiency showed a similar trend
(P 5 0?0002), with an adjusted prevalence ratio of 0?3 (95 % CI 0?1, 0?8). Pre-
valence ratios were similar in adults .50 years of age, although the prevalence of
low B12
and biochemical deficiency was proportionally higher.
Conclusions: Consumption of B12
-containing supplements was associated with at
least 50 % lower prevalence of both low serum B12
and biochemical B12
defi-
ciency in a nationally representative sample of US adults, suggesting increased
consumption of B12
from supplements or from fortified foods may reduce the
prevalence of B12
deficiency. Additionally, the current Recommended Daily
Allowance for B12
of 2?4 mg may be insufficient for those aged .50 years.

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) extensively reviewed the
available data on vitamin B12
(B12
) deficiency and
requirements, and has identified biochemical B12
defi-
ciency and effective methods to reduce risk of B12
defi-
ciency as high priorities for research(1). The Recommended
Daily Allowance (RDA) was set at 120 % of the daily
requirement and is expected to protect 97­98 % of healthy
persons from deficiency. Based on the lower bioavailability
of food-bound B12
in older individuals, the IOM recom-
mended adults over the age of 50 years meet the RDA for
B12
of 2?4 mg by consuming synthetic vitamin B12
in B12
-
fortified foods or B12
supplements(1). Previously, three
population-based studies examined biochemical indicators
of B12
deficiency (serum B12
and/or homocysteine and
methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations) in relation to
vitamin supplement status and concluded that B12
-con-
taining supplements may protect against B12
deficiency(2­4).
However, all three studies used data from elderly, racially
homogeneous cohorts with relatively small sample sizes,
limiting the generalizability of their findings to the US adult
population. Therefore, we used data from NHANES III
(Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)
to further explore the relationship between B12
supplement
use and biochemically defined B12
deficiency in a large,
nationally representative population sample of the US adult
population.

Methods
Subjects
NHANES III was conducted with a complex, multistage
probability design(5). Persons older than 60 years as well
as African-American and Mexican-Americans were over-
sampled to more precisely assess US health and nutri-
tional measures. Importantly, NHANES III was the first
NHANES survey without an upper age limit, thus
improving the estimates of health and nutrition in older
segments of the population. The survey design was
approved by the National Center for Health Statistics
institutional review board (IRB) and participants gave
written informed consent prior to undergoing survey
procedures(5); the present analysis was thus deemed
exempt from review by the Emory University IRB. The
survey was divided into two phases (Phase 1, 1988­91
and Phase 2, 1991­4), designed to allow individual or
combined phase analysis. Because homocysteine con-
centrations were measured only in Phase 2, the current
analysis focuses on data from non-pregnant adults (age
18 years and older) in Phase 2 (September 1991­October
1994) for whom supplement use information and
laboratory analyses of serum B12
and homocysteine are
available (n 8394). Laboratory measurements, including
serum B12
and total serum homocysteine concentrations,
were collected and measured in accordance with
NHANES III procedures(5­7).
Per NHANES protocol, persons who were institutiona-
lized, had haemophilia or had undergone chemotherapy
for cancer within the previous four weeks were excluded
from phlebotomy and thus from the present analysis.
Serum B12
concentrations were analysed with a commer-
cially available radioprotein binding assay kit (Quantaphase
II from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA; during
NHANES III, Phase 2). EDTA-treated plasma was not
available from NHANES III and serum homocysteine con-
centration was measured by HPLC with fluorometric
detection. Further survey procedure details, including
how demographic, medical history and medication and
supplement intakes were collected, may be found in the
NHANES III plan and operation(5) and in the data doc-
umentation on the NHANES website (http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/nhanes.htm). In addition, pregnant females (n 167)
and persons who reported taking antiretroviral prescription
medication for HIV (n 7) were excluded because B12
nutriture is altered in these populations(8,9).
Analysis
There is no gold standard test or definition for B12
defi-
ciency. We used a conservative serum B12
cut-off point of
,148pmol/l (200pg/ml)(10) to define low B12
concentra-
tion. Subjects with serum B12
,148pmol/l and concomitant
serum homocysteine .10?0mmol/l (1?35mg/l) were
defined as biochemically defined B12
-deficient.
The primary exposure variable of interest, B12
-con-
taining supplement use, was ascertained by calculating
the total (single dose) supplemental B12
intake among
supplement users from the NHANES III PUVITMIN and
SUPLCONC data sets, which define supplement use in
this cohort. Supplement users were defined as having
total oral B12
supplement intake .0 mg. Supplement dose
categories were defined as: 0 mg (non-users), .0 to 6 mg
(89 % of whom ingested 6 mg), .6 to 25 mg (88 % of
whom ingested 9­25 mg) and .25 mg. The categories
were chosen such that the lowest category of use inclu-
ded the dose found in many over-the-counter multi-
vitamin supplements (6 mg). The second category of
supplement users includes the 25 mg amount found in
many senior daily multivitamin supplements, and the
highest category included the higher doses (100, 500,
1000 mg) found in high-dose B-vitamin supplements.
Predictors of B12
and/or homocysteine concentrations
which could potentially confound the analysis include
age, race, impaired renal function, smoking(11), heavy
alcohol intake(12,13), hypothyroidism(14) and folate defi-
ciency. Whites tend to have lower serum B12
concentrations
than blacks or Mexican-Americans(15) and Mexican-American
Hispanics tend to have lower homocysteine concentrations
than non-Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks(16).
Except where noted, potential confounding exposure
variables were dichotomized for the univariate analysis
and multivariate logistic regression modelling.
After examining the distribution of cases within quar-
tiles of age and ensuring adequate sample size, age was
classified as a dichotomous variable to match the age
recommendations discussed in the IOM report (18­50
years and .50 years)(1), and included as a continuous
variable in the logistic regression models. Those partici-
pants who reported being current smokers of cigarettes,
pipes or cigars were classified as current smokers. Study
participants' average daily alcohol consumption was
estimated from the NHANES survey alcohol consumption
questions (number of drinks on drinking days3number
of days per year drinking/365). If the number of days per
year drinking was missing, the daily average was calcu-
lated by multiplying the number of drinks on drinking
days by the number days per year with 91 drinks, and
then dividing by 365 days per year. Based on the US
Department of Agriculture's dietary guidelines for alcohol
(no more than one to two drinks of alcohol daily)(17,18)
and the definition of heavy drinking given on the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alcohol fact
sheet, participants whose calculated average daily alcohol
consumption was three or more drinks were classified as
`heavy drinkers'(17,18).
Due to possible alteration in B12
and/or homocysteine
status in renal impairment, serum creatinine was included
as a continuous variable in the multivariate analysis.
Participants with thyroid-stimulating hormone concentra-
tion greater than 5 mIU/l were considered `hypothyroid'

for the present analysis(19). Race was classified into three
groups, white, black and other, based on NHANES analysis
guidelines and available crude sample size(20). Folate is a
major determinant of homocysteine concentrations(7,21,22),
and folate deficiency was therefore defined as red blood cell
(RBC) folate ,232nmol/l (102?6ng/ml; in home-examined
participants, for whom RBC folate analysis was not done,
serum folate ,13?3nmol/l (5?89ng/ml))(6,23).
In all analyses, a 5 0?05 was considered significant and
95 % confidence intervals are reported. To account for the
complex survey design, SURVEY procedures in the SAS
statistical software package version 9?1 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA) were used to estimate the population
prevalence and prevalence ratio estimates. To calculate
crude prevalence ratios, PROCSURVEY FREQ outcome
prevalence estimates from the exposed (supplemented
participants) are divided by the prevalence estimates in
the unexposed (non-supplemented participants).
Unconditional logistic regression techniques were used to
evaluate the univariate frequencies of each potential expo-
sure variable and measures of association were computed,
adjusting for supplement intake. Those exposures variables
which were significantly related to the outcome variable
were then included in a multivariate logistic regression
model. Exposure variables were then removed from the
model by backwards elimination and those exposures
which altered the prevalence odds ratio by more than 10%
were kept in the model. The prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency in the NHANES sample meets the rare disease
assumption, and adjusted prevalence ratios are approxi-
mated from the multivariate logistic regression odds ratios
using the method described by Zhang and Yu(24).
Results
Prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency
Applying the above criteria yielded a crude sample size of
8394 for the analysis of low B12
and 7404 for the analysis
of biochemical B12
deficiency (Table 1). The overall
estimated US adult population prevalence of biochemi-
cally defined B12
deficiency was 1?6 %. The prevalence
was 1?2 % for those aged 18­50 years and 2?5 % for those
aged .50 years. The prevalence of low serum B12
con-
centrations was 3?2 % for all adults, 2?6 % for adults aged
18­50 years and 4?4 % for those aged .50 years (Tables 1,
2 and 3).
B12
-containing supplement consumption and
prevalence ratios
Supplement consumption was associated with lower
prevalence of both low serum B12
concentration and
biochemically determined B12
deficiency in the total
population and in both age categories (18­50 and .50
years, Tables 1­3). Among the over-50 s taking .0­6 mg
or .6­25 mg, supplements reduced the occurrence of
both outcomes by 60­70 %. The prevalence was even
lower among those consuming .25 mg.
Among all B12
-supplement users, the distribution of total
supplemental intakes was skewed, with a mean of 31?4mg/d
and a median of 6?0mg/d (range 0?19­2075mg/d). Of
participants who consumed B12
-containing supplements,
99?8% consumed at least 2?4mg B12
/d (the RDA suggested
by the IOM) and 80?7% consumed 6­25mg B12
/d (the
amounts most commonly found in multivitamin supple-
ments). Of supplement users in the second supplement

significantly associated with biochemical B12
deficiency.
Odds ratio point estimates of biochemical B12
deficiency
were above unity for male gender, non-white or African-
American race, as well as hypothyroid state, but none of
these associations was significant. For each demographic
exposure category (old and young age categories, gender,
white and black races, and all education levels) B12
supplement consumption was associated with reduced
odds of biochemical B12
deficiency.
After adjusting for survey design, 17?9 % of persons had
elevated serum creatinine. However, the prevalence of
low serum B12
concentration and biochemically defined
B12
deficiency in persons with and without elevated
creatinine (.1?1 mg/dl for females, .1?4 mg/dl for males)
was not significantly different (P 5 0?5 for low B12
and
P 5 0?09 for biochemically determined B12
deficiency).
Similarly, the prevalence of low B12
in participants aged
.50 years with normal creatinine (4?1 %) was not sig-
nificantly different from that in older participants with
elevated creatinine (5?2 %, P 5 0?26).
Multivariate logistic regression model analysis revealed
that hypothyroidism, heavy alcohol use and smoking
status were not significant predictors of low serum B12
or
biochemical B12
deficiency. Although lower educational
level showed a statistically significant association with
biochemical B12
deficiency in the univariate analysis,
removing it from the model did not change the pre-
valence ratio estimates. Similarly, removing serum crea-
tinine concentration from the multivariate model did not
affect the point estimates or confidence intervals.
Discussion
Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we found that
intake of supplements providing 6 or 25 mg of vitamin B12
was associated with reductions in the prevalence of bio-
chemical B12
deficiency and low serum B12
concentra-
tions in US adults (aged both 18 years and older and
above 50 years). The majority of supplement users met or
exceeded the IOM RDA of B12
intake (2?4 mg) because the
supplemental B12
quantities commonly found in over-the-
counter multivitamin supplements range from 6 to 25 mg.
Although we cannot conclude that there is a significant
benefit to consuming 6 mg v. 2?4 mg supplement, or 25 mg
v. 6 mg supplement, our data suggest that the prevalence
of B12
deficiency (defined as low serum B12
or bio-
chemical deficiency) among persons aged .50 years
who consume B12
supplements is half to two-thirds the
prevalence in persons who do not consume B12
supple-
ments; the difference between prevalence for supplement
users v. non-users in persons aged 18­50 years is about
a third. The prevalence reduction was even higher in
persons taking .25 mg supplemental B12
daily.
Although there was overlap in the confidence intervals,
the trend we observed of decreasing prevalence of low
serum B12
and biochemical B12
deficiency with increas-
ing B12
supplement dose is consistent with results seen in
vitamin supplement intervention trials in the elderly(25­28).
In three of these studies, 10­500mg of supplemental B12
increased serum B12
concentrations by 18?5­166pmol/l
(25­225pg/ml)(25­27). Along with our findings, these studies
indicate that daily doses of supplemental B12
as low as 6mg
can shift the distribution of B12
concentrations upwards
in the general population and reduce biochemical B12
deficiency prevalence.
About 2 % of people aged .50 years will still have low
B12
concentrations despite consuming 6­25 mg of syn-
thetic B12
. Daily consumption of more than 75 mg B12
may
nearly eliminate low B12
and biochemical B12
deficiency,
but more research is needed to determine how much
supplement is needed by those individuals for whom
6 or 25 mg/d does not prevent low B12
or biochemical
B12
deficiency.
Given the success of a proof of concept study by
Winkels et al.(29), our data suggest that a B12
fortification
programme that delivered 6 to 25 mg of synthetic vitamin
B12
to most of the population may be highly effective in
decreasing the prevalence of both low B12
concentrations
and biochemically defined B12
deficiency. Were such a
programme implemented, there would be fewer patients
with low serum B12
and biochemically defined B12
deficiency for clinicians to investigate. Several studies
have reported that adults with suboptimal B12
status
have poorer cognitive functioning or could improve
with supplementation(30­32). However, results from other
B-vitamin supplement trials have failed to yield clinically
measurable benefit(33,34). Further investigations are
required to determine whether improving B12
status with
fortification would result in improved functional status or
clinical benefit.
The prevalence of low B12
in NHANES III (3?2 %) was
similar to that previously observed in NHANES III (3 %)(7),
but was lower than that observed in other cohort studies
in the USA (5?3­14?5 %)(2,3,35). However, those studies
focused on racially homogeneous, elderly cohorts rather
than the entire adult population, and they had relatively
small sample sizes. Increased age and white race have
both been associated with lower B12
concentrations(15)
and estimates from predominantly older, white cohorts
may therefore overestimate the national prevalence of B12
deficiency. The higher cut-off points for defining low B12
(,221 pmol/l or 300 pg/ml) in three non-institutionalized
adult populations(2,3,35) and two outpatient source
populations(35,36) may also explain the lower prevalence
of B12
deficiency in our study population. Overall, our
study supports the results of previous studies, but widens
their generalizability for the US population.
We did not examine the limited physical examination
data in NHANES III addressing whether persons with
biochemically determined B12
deficiency exhibited clinical
signs of B12
deficiency. Although 6 to 25mg of supplemental
B12
supplement use and biochemical deficiency in NHANES III 29

appears to prevent most preclinical deficiency indi-
cators in those aged 18 years and older, higher doses may
be warranted in persons over 50 years old or with clinical
signs such as anaemia and/or neuropathy(25). We remind
clinicians that patients with clinical symptoms consistent
with clinical B12
deficiency disease should be worked up
and treated with an appropriate dose of vitamin B12
.
The primary strength of our analysis is that it examines
a nationally representative population sample of ambu-
latory persons in the USA. With the largest sample size
reported to date (over 8000 participants), we were able to
adjust prevalence ratio estimates for the most common
potential confounding exposures, including age, race,
educational level, renal insufficiency and folate status.
A potential weakness of our study is the absence of
MMA data to use as a criterion for biochemical determi-
nation of B12
deficiency. An elevated MMA concentration
is typically considered a more specific confirmatory
indicator of B12
deficiency than elevated homocysteine.
Because NHANES III MMA data are not publicly available,
we chose a homocysteine cut-off that is within the range
expected in B12
- and folate-replete individuals(23,37).
Another potential weakness of our study is the incom-
plete exclusion of HIV-positive individuals(38). Given that
low B12
concentrations are reportedly less likely in HIV
after antiretroviral therapy is started(8), those excluded
were least likely to be cases. HIV patients use supple-
ments at a higher rate (over 70 %) than the general
population and the participants not excluded would
likely increase the number of exposed controls, poten-
tially resulting in bias towards the null. However, at the
estimated prevalence of HIV of 0?34 %(38), unidentified
HIV-positive individuals would have virtually no impact
on the prevalence of B12
deficiency and prevalence ratio
estimates in our data.
In conclusion, consumption of supplements with 6 or
25 mg of vitamin B12
was associated with about a 50 %
reduction in the prevalence of low B12
concentrations and
biochemically defined B12
deficiency. These findings
suggest that approximately three million cases of low
serum B12
and biochemical B12
deficiency in the US
population may be prevented if all adults consumed
6­25 mg B12
/d from supplements or fortified foods. We
also found low vitamin B12
concentrations and bio-
chemically defined vitamin B12
deficiency in 1­2 % of
persons aged .50 years who were consuming 6 to 25 mg
of B12
from supplements. This relatively high prevalence
in older supplement users suggests that the current RDA
of 2?4 mg/d may be too low for this age group. As Berry et
al. noted, people who have low serum concentrations of
B12
may have problems in absorbing free B12
(39) and have
the preclinical pernicious anaemia that Carmel et al. have
identified among those over 50 years of age(10). Clinicians
should be vigilant for subtle signs and symptoms of
pernicious anaemia and clinical vitamin B12
deficiency,
particularly in older adults who have low concentration of
serum B12
and/or biochemically defined vitamin B12
deficiency in spite of consuming vitamin B12
supple-
ments, and manage these patients appropriately.
