Abstract
Objective: To compare dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
T2
-weighted imaging (T2
WI) at 3.0T for detection of prostate cancer.
Methods: Patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen underwent T2
WI and DCE-MRI prior
to prostate needle biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and
negative predictive value (NPV) of T2
WI and DCE-MRI to diagnose prostate cancer were
evaluated. The relationship between Gleason score and prostate cancer detection by DCE-MRI
was evaluated.
Results: Prostate adenocarcinoma was histopathologically confirmed in 44/75 patients. DCE-MRI
had significantly higher sensitivity, accuracy and NPV than T2
WI. The detection rate of prostate
cancer by DCE-MRI was significantly better for tumours with Gleason score 7­9 than for those
Gleason score 4­6.
Conclusion: DCE-MRI at 3.0T can significantly improve prostate cancer detection using simple
visual diagnostic criteria, compared with T2
WI.

transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS)
biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). MRI has been widely used to aid
prostate cancer detection and tumour sta-
ging. T2
-weighted imaging (T2
WI), in which
tumour tissue appears hypointense relative
to the normal peripheral tissue,2 has been
used for morphological prostate tumour
detection and localization, but the specificity
of T2
WI is low because benign prostatic
hyperplasia, prostatitis, fibrosis and post-
biopsy haemorrhage also cause T2
hypoin-
tensities.3­5 In addition, some prostate
tumours appear normal on T2
WI, leading
to low sensitivity of this method.6,7
Functional MR techniques (such as dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI [DCE-MRI], diffu-
sion-weighted imaging [DWI], and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) have been
used to increase the diagnostic accuracy of
MR in prostate cancer.8­10
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is
useful in imaging tumour vascularization,
vascular permeability and perfusion.11 The
method involves intravascular injection of
contrast agents and imaging of their con-
centrations in blood and tissue over time.11
Analysing contrast agent uptake in tissues
usually involves the generation of a semi-
quantitative signal intensity/time curve or
more complicated quantitative approaches
using pharmacokinetic models. The highly
specialized and time-consuming nature of
these analyses likely prevents widespread
clinical implementation of these meth-
ods,12,13 and, since they are nonstandar-
dized, often generate unclear results.14­17
Studies have focused on the analysis of raw
DCE T1
-weighted images (T1
WI), which can
be more easily implemented in daily clinical
practice, compared with other imaging
modalities.18­23 These studies had low tem-
poral resolution, minimal dynamic series
and an acquisition time that was too
brief to allow prostate cancer detection or
comprehensive measurement of tumour
haemodynamics.
The aims of the present study, therefore,
were to evaluate the clinical value of 3.0T
DCE-MRI in detecting prostate cancer, and
to compare imaging results with TRUS-
guided biopsy findings.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited consecutive male
patients with elevated PSA (>4.0 ng/ml)
and/or prostate nodule detected during
digital rectal examination who attended the
Department of Radiology, Zhujiang
Hospital of Southern Medical University,
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China,
for diagnosis between January 2012 and July
2013. Patients were required to have under-
gone both MRI and a subsequent transrec-
tal prostate biopsy, and to not have received
any treatment for prostate cancer.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Zhujiang Hospital of
Southern Medical University, Guangzhou,
China. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients prior to enrolment.
MRI
All MRI examinations were performed on a
3.0T whole-body multitransmit scanner
system (Achieva TX, Philips Healthcare,
Best, The Netherlands) using a 16-channel
SENSE XL torso coil. T2
-weighed, turbo
spin-echo images with spectrally selective
attenuated inversion recovery were obtained
in the axial and coronal planes (repetition
time [TR] 1483 ms; echo time [TE] 70 ms;
slice thickness 5 mm; interslice gap 1 mm;
number of slices 20; field of view [FOV]
240 Â 240 mm; matrix size 256 Â 256 pixels).
DCE-MRI was performed using a three-
dimensional (3D) T1
-fast field-echo (FFE)
sequence in the axial plane (TR 5.5 ms; TE
1.7 ms, slice thickness 6 mm [reconstructed
to 3 mm]; interslice gap 0 mm; FOV
230 Â 230 mm; flip angle 15; matrix size
1078 Journal of International Medical Research 42(5)
256 Â 256 pixels). DCE-MRI images were
scanned from the apex to the base of the
prostate and a total of 20 slices were
obtained. A 20-slice volume was obtained
every 2.9 s and imaging comprised eight
precontrast volumes and 96 postcontrast
volumes. Postcontrast imaging was initiated
immediately after administering 0.1 mmol/
kg body weight gadopentetate dimeglumine
(MagnevistÕ, Bayer Schering Pharma,
Germany) at 2.5 ml/s via the cephalic vein.
Contrast agent injections were followed by a
15-ml saline flush. The DCE-MRI examin-
ation time was 5 min and 6 s.
Postimaging prostate biopsy
Within 2 weeks of MRI, all patients under-
went an extended 12- to 18-core TRUS-
guided biopsy. All samples were obtained
from the peripheral zone bilaterally, includ-
ing the base, mid-gland, apex, and the
bilateral transitional zone. Each sample
was histologically analysed by the same
pathologist with 15 years' genitourinary
experience, and was determined to be can-
cerous or noncancerous according to the
pathology.
MRI analyses
The T2
WI and DCE-MRI data were pro-
spectively analysed by two radiologists who
were blinded to the clinical data (X-H.Z.
and X-Y.Q., with 10 and 13 years' experi-
ence reading prostate MR images, respect-
ively). On T2
WI, prostate cancer was defined
as hypointense nodules in the peripheral
zone, or areas of homogeneous hypointen-
sity with ill-defined margins and no visible
capsule in the transitional zone of the pros-
tate gland. DCE-MRI evaluation of
unmodified T1
images, before and after
administration of the contrast agent, defined
prostate cancer as nodular foci that showed
early and strong enhancement, and rapid
washout relative to the background in the
peripheral zone and transitional zone.
Nodular foci showing early and strong
enhancement followed by a plateau phase
were not considered to be prostate cancer,
and neither were nodular foci showing per-
sistent enhancement. The prostate was
divided into eight regions on MRI, corres-
ponding to TRUS-guided biopsy (the
bilateral peripheral zone including the
base, mid-gland, apex and the bilateral
transitional zone). MR regions were classi-
fied as cancerous or noncancerous according
to the pathological results of corresponding
biopsy cores.
Statistical analyses
Patients with at least one region with posi-
tive MR and biopsy findings were con-
sidered true positives (TP). Patients with
negative MR and biopsy findings in all
regions were considered true negatives
(TN). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, posi-
tive predictive value (PPV) and negative
predictive value (NPV) were calculated
according to the following formulae:
Sensitivity ¼ TP/number of patients with
cancer at biopsy; Specificity ¼ TN/number
of patients without cancer at biopsy;
Accuracy ¼ TP þ TN/number of patients;
PPV ¼ TP/number of patients with positive
MRI; NPV ¼ TN/number of patients with
negative MRI.
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or
n (%). The sensitivity, specificity and
accuracy of each technique for the diag-
nosis of prostate cancer were compared
using McNemar test. Positive predictive
value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV) were compared using 2-test; 2-
test was also used to correlate Gleason
scores and prostate cancer detection by
DCE-MRI. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSSÕ version 13.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.

Results
The study included 75 patients (mean age
69 Æ 8 years; range 50­83 years; median
PSA concentration 14.19 ng/ml; range
4.59­470.3 ng/ml). Prostate adenocarcin-
oma was histopathologically confirmed in
44 patients (58.7%). MR images of two
representative patients with prostate adeno-
carcinoma are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Biopsy findings of the remaining 31 patients
without cancer included benign prostatic
hyperplasia (n ¼ 26) and prostatitis (n ¼ 5).
Data regarding sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy, PPV and NPV of each MRI
technique for the diagnosis of prostate
cancer are given in Table 1. DCE-MRI
had significantly higher sensitivity
(P ¼ 0.008), accuracy (P ¼ 0.003) and NPV
(P ¼ 0.006) than T2
WI. The specificity and
PPV of DCE-MRI were higher than those of
T2
WI, but these differences were not statis-
tically significant.
A total of nine patients had Gleason
scores 6 (4, n ¼ 1; 5, n ¼ 2; 6, n ¼ 6); the
remaining 35 tumours were scored ! 7 (7,
n ¼ 21; 8, n ¼ 10; 9, n ¼ 4). The DCE-MRI
prostate cancer detection rate was
significantly higher for tumours with
Gleason scores of 7­9 than those with
scores of 4­6 (97 vs 67%; P ¼ 0.029).
Discussion
The utility of T2
WI in differentiating
between prostate cancer and other abnorm-
alities is limited. To improve prostate cancer
detection, conventional T2
WI is comple-
mented by functional MR techniques such
as DCE-MRI, DWI, and MRS.8­10 The
present study investigated the use of T2
WI
and DCE-MRI at 3.0T to differentiate can-
cerous prostate tissue from noncancerous
tissue, and found that DCE-MRI was sig-
nificantly more sensitive, accurate and had
better NPV for cancer detection than T2
WI.
Specificity and PPV were not significantly
different between DCE-MRI and T2
WI,
however.
Prostate cancer generally develops as
multiple lesions, and the sensitivity and
specificity of DCE-MRI therefore vary
between reports.20­23 Using a per-sector
analysis to measure sensitivity and specifi-
city, a per-patient analysis was found to
have higher sensitivity but decreased

specificity.21 Others found a dramatic dif-
ference in specificity between per-sector and
per-patient analyses for DCE-MRI that was
thought to be due to the very high propor-
tion of prostate regions without cancer,
which could lead to an overestimation of
specificity in per-sector analysis.20 In add-
ition, a single false-positive sector was
sufficient for a patient to be counted as a
false-positive result on per-patient ana-
lysis.20 Other studies have suggested that
multifocal prostate cancer usually comprises
a dominant, potentially aggressive tumour
that would warrant therapy, but other
smaller foci are clinically insignificant and
should only be monitored.24,25 The domin-
ant tumour is usually considered to be the
largest tumour body. The present study,

therefore, estimated sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy, PPV and NPV of DCE-MRI for
prostate cancer using a per-patient analysis.
Most prostate cancers have higher vascu-
larity and permeability than background
prostate tissue, showing early and strong
enhancement, and rapid washout relative to
background prostate tissue.26 This is con-
firmed by the findings of the present study,
where our per-patient analysis resulted in
greater sensitivity, specificity and accuracy
than those of others.20,21 This may be due to
several factors. First, the use of 3.0T in the
current study allows for higher signal-to-
noise ratio than the 1.5T used by others.20,21
Secondly, temporal resolution was 2.9 s in
our study, but 15­20 s in the other stu-
dies.20,21 Early enhancement is more difficult
to identify using longer acquisition times
(e.g., >15 s).15 Finally, the time period
between bolus injection and peak intensity
has been shown to be 70­180 s in cancerous
tissue (mean 103 s) compared with 200­300 s
(mean 250 s) in noncancerous tissue.16 The
delay time in the present study was nearly
300 s, considerably longer than the 120­180 s
used by others.20,21 This extended delay time
is sufficient to enable accurate visualization
of the initial increase in signal enhancement
and gradual changes in signal intensity, in
cancerous and noncancerous tissue.
It is unclear whether the detection rate of
prostate cancer is correlated with Gleason
score.19,27­30 Some studies have found no
significant correlation;27,28 and others have
reported that detection rates were signifi-
cantly higher for high-grade than low-grade
tumours.19,29,30 Consistent with these find-
ings, the results of the present study indicate
that the detection rate for tumours with
Gleason score 7­9 was significantly higher
than that for tumours with score 4­6.19,29,30
There were several limitations to this
study. First, we did not use an endorectal
coil, which gives a high signal-to-noise
ratio but has drawbacks regarding patient
discomfort, time and cost. Secondly, our
reference standard was prostate biopsies,
and it is possible that some patients with
negative biopsy findings could have had
cancer. Moreover, MRI findings do not
correspond directly to biopsy results because
the entire prostate was not evaluated during
biopsy.18 Comparing MR results with histo-
logical specimens of the whole prostate
following radical prostatectomy will be
required in future studies. Finally, needle
biopsy often underestimates Gleason score
compared with prostatectomy, but this
would not change our findings of the rela-
tionship between Gleason score and pros-
tate cancer detection by DCE-MRI.
In conclusion, DCE-MRI at 3.0T can
significantly improve prostate cancer detec-
tion using simple visual diagnostic criteria
compared with T2
WI. In addition, DCE-
MRI has the potential to detect tumours
with high Gleason scores.
