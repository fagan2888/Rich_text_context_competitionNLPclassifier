Abstract: To explain the pervasive role of humor in human social interaction and among
mating partner preferences, Miller (2000a) proposed that intentional humor evolved as an
indicator of intelligence. To test this, we looked at the relationships among rater-judged
humor, general intelligence, and the Big Five personality traits in a sample of 185 college-
age students (115 women, 70 men). General intelligence positively predicted rater-judged
humor, independent of the Big Five personality traits. Extraversion also predicted rater-
judged humor, although to a lesser extent than general intelligence. General intelligence did
not interact with the sex of the participant in predicting rating scores on the humor
production tasks. The current study lends support to the prediction that effective humor
production acts as an honest indicator of intelligence in humans. In addition, extraversion,
and to a lesser extent, openness, may reflect motivational traits that encourage humor
production.
Keywords: Humor, intelligence, sexual selection, individual differences.

Introduction
The phenomenon of humor is a unique, yet universal aspect of human psychology
(Caron, 2002; Gervais and Wilson, 2005; Sroufe and Waters, 1976). The ability to
produce, comprehend, and appreciate various forms of humor is a distinctive hallmark of
human cognition (Provine, 2000, 2004), and a number of theories have been proposed to
elucidate humor's evolutionary origins (Alexander, 1986; Caron, 2002; Gervais and
Wilson, 2005; Miller, 2000a; Weisfeld, 1993). In particular, Miller's account that humor
evolved as a result of sexual selection via mate choice has received a fair amount of
attention in recent years (Bressler and Balshine, 2006; Bressler, Martin, and Balshine.
2006; Greengross and Miller, 2008; Kaufman, Kozbelt, Bromley, and Miller, 2007). His
model posits that humor appreciation is implicitly responding to various cognitive abilities
Humor as a mental fitness indicator

required in producing effective humor. More importantly, Miller sees effective humor
production as a strategy to communicate underlying genetic quality with respect to
psychological traits. Of these traits, general intelligence emerges as one of the most
comprehensive and heritable psychological constructs (Jensen, 1998). General intelligence
has also been found to show strong correlations to other indicators of genetic quality, such
as long-term health (Deary, 2005; Gottfredson and Deary, 2004; Kanazawa, 2006),
physiological symmetry (Bates, 2007; Luxen and Buunk, 2006; Prokosch, Yeo, and Miller,
2004), and developmental stability (Thoma et al., 2005). Thus, Miller's model posits that
some of the individual differences in humor production will reflect differences in general
intelligence and its underlying genetic fitness. As a result, a preference for humor in
potential mates, and a motivation to produce displays of effective humor in courtship and
social settings, serves an adaptive purpose because effective humor is an honest and
reliable indicator of mental ability and biological fitness (see Miller, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c).
The importance of humor in mate preference is supported in a number of self-report
(Buss and Barnes, 1986; Feingold, 1992; Goodwin, 1990; Grammer and Eibl-Eibesfelt,
1990; Hansen, 1977; Regan and Joshi, 2003; Sprecher and Regan, 2002) and experimental
(Bressler and Balshine, 2006; Bressler et al., 2006) studies of mating preferences. In
addition, mate preferences for intelligence are also well established (Buss, 1989, 1994;
Regan and Joshi, 2003). If humor is an honest signal of intelligence and Miller's model of
humor is correct, then intelligence and humor should be positively correlated. However,
only two studies have explicitly looked at the relationship between humor and intelligence.
Feingold and Mazzella (1991) found a positive correlation between measured verbal
intelligence and rater-judged humor production in a college age sample (r = .40). Masten
(1986) reported substantial positive correlations among IQ, academic achievement, and
rater-judged humor production in 10 to 14-year-old children (r = .50 - .53).
The current study investigates the relationship between general intelligence and
rater-judged humor production, with a few key differences from the aforementioned
studies. The current method provides a clearer estimation of general intelligence relative to
the Feingold and Mazzella (1991) study, and unlike the pre-adolescent sample in the
Masten (1986) study, the college-age sample is consistent with Miller's model that costly
displays of humor would manifest primarily during peak reproductive years (Miller,
2000c). We assessed humor with open-ended verbal and drawing tasks and measure
general intelligence using an 18-item version of the Raven's Advanced Progressive
Matrices (Raven, Raven, and Court, 1998). In addition, we included a Big Five personality
assessment to look at how personality traits are related to humor production. Previous
research has found that openness has shown a significant positive relationship to general
intelligence (Ashton, Lee, Vernon, and Jang, 2000; Harris, 2004; Miller and Tal, 2007;
Shafer, 1999) and finding a positive relationship to humor production would lend support
to Miller's model. Furthermore, these personality traits will serve as useful control
variables to see if the role of intelligence is a unique predictor of humor production. These
findings represent a key step in assessing a key prediction of Miller's model, and may help
elucidate the evolutionary basis of humor.

Materials and Methods
Participants and procedures
One hundred and eighty-five undergraduate students (115 women, 70 men; Mean
age = 22 years, SD = 4.11 years, Range = 18 ­ 45; 45% Caucasian, 55% Hispanic) from
California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), and Saddleback Community College
(SCC) voluntarily completed a paper and pencil questionnaire. All students participated in
partial fulfillment of course credit. Participants completed the questionnaires under
conditions of complete confidentiality and anonymity. The CSULB Institutional Review
Board approved all materials and procedures in the study.
Individual difference measures
All participants provided general demographic information such as age, sex,
ethnicity, sexual orientation, height, weight, and basic academic history. General
intelligence was measured using an 18-item version of the Raven's Advanced Progressive
Matrices (Miller and Tal, 2007; Raven et al., 1998). The Raven's Progressive Matrices test
has been shown to have a high factor loading (.60) with general intelligence (Marshalek,
Lohman, and Snow, 1983), and published test reliability scores on the 12-item short form
of the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices range from  = .66 to .73, compared to  =
.84 for the original 36-item version (Arthur and Day, 1994; Arthur et al., 1999; Raven,
Raven, and Court, 1998). Score distributions of the 18-item Raven's Advanced
Progressive Matrices from the samples studied are as follows: CSULB participants (n =
139; Mean score = 10.61, SD = 3.08 years, range = 3 - 18) and SCC participants (n = 46;
Mean score = 11.67, SD = 2.86 years, range = 6 - 17). These distributions are very similar
to those reported in the normative sample of Arthur, Tubre, Paul, and Sanchez-Ku (1999).
Personality was measured using a 50-item version taken from the International
Personality Item Pool (IPIP; Goldberg et al., 2006). Drawing from constructs similar to
those in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa and McCrae, 1982), the
IPIP scale assessed the Big-Five personality traits (with corresponding internal
consistencies in the current sample): openness ( = .69), conscientiousness ( = .85),
extraversion ( = .89), agreeableness ( = .75), and neuroticism ( = .85). All IPIP items
used can be found at http://ipip.ori.org/newNEODomainsKey.htm.
Humor production tasks
To measure humor, we used an open-ended response format designed to give the
participant the opportunity to display humorous content in a loosely-restricted template.
Before engaging in the tasks, participants were instructed to produce humorous content
with the knowledge that it would be read and judged by anonymous raters. Participants
were asked to complete three different tasks, each designed to measure different aspects of
humor production. The latter two tasks were adopted and revised from creativity measures
used in Miller and Tal (2007).
The first task consisted of six character profile forms to be filled in by the
participant (Figure 1). This task was designed to measure verbal humor in the context of
witty stereotypes and references. Each profile contained an individual portrait photograph
(three male and three female portraits in all) along with general headings (e.g., name,
Humor as a mental fitness indicator
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(4). 2008. -655-
occupation, typical day) to help create a mock description of the individual in the
photograph. All six individuals portrayed in the character profile task were friends of the
author, and gave written consent to use their photograph. None of the individuals portrayed
had any knowledge of or relationship to any potential participant currently attending
CSULB or SCC.

The second task consisted of three questions to be answered by the participant
(Figure 2). This task was designed to measure verbal humor in the context of sarcastic
and/or disparaging responses. The instructions on this subset present the questions as a
hypothetical e-mail from a friend asking for humorous responses geared at finding
differences in types of humor.

For this task, I want you to imagine that you've just received an e-mail by a fellow
student asking if you could write some responses to the questions posed below. Your
fellow student mentions that this is for a school project on the diversity of humorous
responses, and asks that you try to write something funny for each question.
Question 1: "If you could experience what it's like to be a different kind of animal for a
day, what kind would of animal would you not want to be, and why?"
Question 2: "How would you make a marriage exciting after the first couple of years?"
Question 3: "What do you think the world will be like in a hundred years?"
The third task measured non-verbal humor. Participant's created a total of eight
humorous drawings of different types of animals and people (Figure 3).

Humor judges
Twenty-eight undergraduate and graduate student volunteers (14 women, 14 men;
Mean age = 23.38 years, SD = 3.6 years, range = 18 - 30) from California State University,
Long Beach rated the humor production tasks. Students recruited from Introductory
Psychology classes did so in partial fulfillment of psychology course credit requirements.
Judges completed all ratings under conditions of complete confidentiality and anonymity.
In addition, all ratings were done independently, blindly, and without any explicit
knowledge of the participant's sex, intelligence, personality, or other information.

Humor ratings
Each participant's six character profiles, three e-mail response answers, and two
pages of humorous drawings (four drawings per page) were rated independently by four
judges (two women and two men) on a 1-7 humor scale (e.g., 1 = "not funny at all," 4 =
"Moderately Funny," and 7 = "Hilarious"). To keep the number of ratings done per judge
manageable, ratings were done in blocks, such that each judge provided humor scores for
blocks of 22 ­ 35 participants. All judges were randomly assigned to fill the requisite slots
in each rating block. In all, seven rating blocks were used to provide humor scores for the
total amount of participants. Humor was not formally defined for the judges.
Results
Humor ratings
Looking at the distribution of raw rating scores, the majority of aggregated ratings
per participant were quite low (Mean score = 2.31, SD = .625 years, range = 1.27 ­ 4.25).
Distributional properties of the humor ratings showed a slight positive skew and no clear
kurtosis. Our first concern was to see if judges were interpreting the 1-7 humor scale in a
consistent manner. We first compared the seven rating blocks using a one-way ANOVA,
finding a significant difference in raw mean humor scores between rating blocks, F(6, 178)
= 19.03 (p = .000). We subsequently looked at raw mean humor scores of the four judges
within each rating block, finding significant differences in all seven rating blocks (all ps <
.01). In order to correct for differences in scale usage, we standardized all of the ratings
given by each judge.
Inter-rater reliabilities were then computed for the four judges within each rating
block. We first computed the inter-rater reliability for each of the eleven humor task items
individually, finding an average Cronbachs Alpha () = .58 and average inter-rater
correlation ( r
i
) = .28 across all seven rating blocks. Although these reliabilities are below
the commonly accepted reliability criterion for psychological measurements, they are
consistent with past humor production measures (Feingold and Mazzella, 1991; Köhler and
Ruch, 1996; Masten, 1986), and possibly reflect the varied nature of humor preferences.
Next, we looked at inter-rater reliabilities among mean scores of each humor subtask across
all seven rating blocks, with  = .72 and r
i
= .39 for the six character profiles,  = .63 and
r
i
= .32 for the three e-mail responses, and  = .71 and r
i
= .40 for the two pages of
humorous drawings. Finally, we looked at entire humor task including all 11 items, with 
= .74 and r
i
= .42.
A factor analysis on all 11 items was analyzed using principal components and
promax rotation in SPSS. Looking strictly at factor loadings, a verbal and drawing factor
seemed to emerge. Upon further analysis, indications from the scree plot (Figure 4)
suggested only one predominant factor, where the first factor accounted for 49% of the
variance while the second accounted for 10%.

Figure 4. Scree Plot on humor item factor loadings (Using Principal Components and
Promax rotation)
In addition, the component correlation matrix showed an r = .61 between the two
factors. Thus, the mean score of all 11 items (which we refer to as "humor production")
was used as the quantitative basis for the humor construct, as it accounted for the most
variance in the factor analysis and showed the highest and most consistent inter-rater
reliability across the seven rating blocks. In Table 1, we have included a factor loading plot
with both factors because we believe that if the drawing tasks were given equal weighting
to the other tasks, a two factor solution would have emerged. We have also included item
correlations with our main predictor of intelligence.

significantly and positively correlated with general intelligence, openness, extraversion,
height, and weight. None of the variables in Table 2 showed any significant non-linear
relationships.
We were interested in the significant correlations of weight and height to humor
production, and decided to calculate a body mass index (BMI) variable. Despite the
significant correlations in height and weight, BMI did not correlate with humor production,
r(183) = .10, p = .21.
Humor production multiple regression
To analyze key predictors of humor production, we entered ten variables into
multiple regression: general intelligence, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, neuroticism, age, height, weight, and number of semesters in college.
Standardized beta weights and significance levels are shown in Table 3, with both general
intelligence and extraversion being significant and unique predictors of humor production.

Sex differences in humor production
Independent samples t-test indicated that standardized male humor scores (M = .19)
were rated significantly higher than standardized female humor scores (M = -.11), t(183) =
2.75, p = .007 (two-tailed), d = .40. This result is consistent with previous studies on sex
differences in humor (Thorson and Powell, 1993b; Ziv, 1984) as well as Miller's sexual
selection model that reproductive benefits for humorous displays would be greater for
males than females (Miller, 2000c). Table 4 displays the bivariate correlations showing sex
differences with regard to humor production.

We ran a moderated regression to understand if the relationship of general
intelligence to humor production depended on sex. Counter to Miller's prediction that male
displays of humor, being more effective, will have a stronger relationship with general
intelligence (Prediction 5 in Miller, 2000c), female intelligence ( = .33, t(113) = 3.70, p =
.000) was a stronger predictor of humor than male intelligence ( = .15, t(68) = 1.23, p =
.22), although this interaction was not statistically significant ( = -.11, t(181) = -.70, p =
.49). We also ran a moderated regression on openness, as it also showed sex differences in
the bivariate correlations. Male openness ( = .38, t(68) = 3.33, p = .001) was a stronger
predictor of humor than female openness ( = .11, t(113) = 1.13, p = .26), and this
interaction was statistically significant ( = .18, t(181) = 2.36, p = .02). This result is more
consistent with Miller's prediction, although openness can only be considered an indirect
assessment of intelligence. We should also note that there were no significant interactions
with respect to the sex of the judges on any of the relationships to humor production.
Discussion
Consistent with the previous research on humor and intelligence (Feingold and
Mazzella, 1991; Masten, 1986), we found that humorous pictures and stories created by
individuals higher on general intelligence are rated as being funnier. This result holds after
controlling for Big Five personality factors. Although females showed a stronger
relationship of humor production to general intelligence than males, which ran counter to
our expectations, this difference was not significant.
The relationship of humor production to extraversion is also consistent with
previous research (Köhler and Ruch, 1992; Thorson and Powell, 1993b). The current study
showed that extraversion corresponds to facets of sociability (e.g., "have a lot to say", "feel
comfortable around people"), dominance (e.g., "like to draw attention to myself"), and
active sensation seeking (e.g., "am the life of the party"). With respect to reproductive
fitness, recent evidence found that extraversion has a consistent cross-cultural relationship
with short-term mating success (Schmitt and Shackelford, 2008). Although openness
showed a significant bivariate correlation with humor production, particularly in males, this
effect was diminished when observed in the multiple regression analysis and did not show
any significant relationship with intelligence. Despite this, the similar bivariate
Humor as a mental fitness indicator
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(4). 2008. -662-
correlations of humor production to both extraversion and openness may be indicative of
tendencies for exploratory behaviors, cognitive flexibility, and desire for novelty found in
the higher-order "plasticity" dimension (see DeYoung, Peterson, and Higgins, 2002). This
suggests that humor production has a social component distinct from its cognitive
relationship, and we speculate that this social component is tied to the motivation to
produce humor displays in social contexts.
Our preliminary findings support Miller's contention that humor evolved as an
honest display of general intelligence in humans. In turn, individual differences in humor
production taps into the large portion of heritable mental abilities that make up general
intelligence, with humor appreciation (as rated by the humor judges in this study) reflecting
this association (Miller, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c). However, the low reliability of agreement
in rating humor production has been an issue here and in other studies (see Feingold and
Mazzella, 1991; Köhler and Ruch, 1996; Masten, 1986). This presents a challenge to
Miller's model that humor appreciation is consistent enough between individuals to reliably
indicate any other individual differences in humor producers.
Limitations and future directions
The current study only assessed one particular facet of humor production­written
and drawn forms of creative stereotypes and descriptive statements. To preserve
participant confidentiality and anonymity, as well as methodological feasibility,
ecologically valid aspects of humor production, such as social setting, interpersonal
relations, shared knowledge, and spontaneity had to be sacrificed. As a result, participants
and judges may have been less motivated to produce and appreciate humor, respectively,
leading to decreased power to detect actual individual differences in humor production.
Thus, the construct of humor investigated here may give only a partial glimpse into the
phenomenon of humor and how it relates to other patterns of individual differences. Future
studies investigating more ecologically valid measures of humor (e.g., observational
studies) and self-report measures of humor production (see Thorson and Powell, 1993a)
would broaden the scope of the current study. In addition, our study did not investigate
heritable biological fitness in terms of genetic quality or overall health, and further research
on the relationship of humor production to other fitness-related constructs will be necessary
to understand the full breadth of humor production as a fitness indicator.
Another limitation came from partitioning humor ratings into blocks instead of
having each rater judge the entire sample of humor tasks, which may have weakened the
consistency and reliability of the rating process. However, the alternative method of
having fewer raters judge the entire sample of humor tasks also has a potential cost of not
representing the varied nature of humor preferences, making this issue difficult to resolve
without extensive resources. Furthermore, due to the pencil and paper format of the humor
tasks, there is a possibility that raters may have inferred the sex of the participant by their
penmanship, which may have biased their subsequent rating for the humor task.
With respect to Miller's notion that the primary function of humor is to display
intelligence during courtship (Miller, 2000a), the humor tasks in the current study were not
designed to assess courtship-motivated humor. In our case, the types of humor used may
reflect content that extends outside of a courtship context. Distinguishing the types of
humor used for courtship from those used in non-courtship social interactions may reveal
differences and similarities between social and sexual selection strategies, and how humor
Humor as a mental fitness indicator

may be strategically manipulated to serve different adaptive functions (see Griskevicius et
al., 2007).
Summary
The current study serves as an exploratory glimpse into the evolutionary basis of
humor. Our findings are consistent with the idea that humor is a signal--an honest
advertisement of underlying cognitive ability and fitness--and that it continues to serve this
function today. However, much more research will be needed to understand its
evolutionary origins and why it is so pervasive in human social interactions.
