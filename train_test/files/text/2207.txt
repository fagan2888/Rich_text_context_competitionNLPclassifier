Abstract
Background: Chronic medical diseases require regular and longitudinal care and self-management for effective
treatment. When chronic diseases include substance use disorders, care and treatment of both the medical and
addiction disorders may affect access to care and the ability to focus on both conditions. The objective of this
paper is to evaluate the association between the presence of chronic medical disease and recent addiction
treatment utilization among adults with substance dependence.
Methods: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis of self-reported baseline data from alcohol and/or drug-
dependent adults enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a disease management program for substance
dependence in primary care. The main independent variable was chronic medical disease status, categorized using
the Katz Comorbidity Score as none, single condition of lower severity, or higher severity (multiple conditions or
single higher severity condition), based on comorbidity scores determined from self-report. Asthma was also
examined in secondary analyses. The primary outcome was any self-reported addiction treatment utilization
(excluding detoxification) in the 3 months prior to study entry, including receipt of any addiction-focused
counseling or addiction medication from any healthcare provider. Logistic regression models were adjusted for
sociodemographics, type of substance dependence, recruitment site, current smoking, and recent anxiety severity.
Results: Of 563 subjects, 184 (33%) reported any chronic disease (20% low severity; 13% higher severity) and 111
(20%) reported asthma; 157 (28%) reported any addiction treatment utilization in the past 3 months. In multivariate
regression analyses, no significant effect was detected for chronic disease on addiction treatment utilization
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.88 lower severity vs. none, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 1.28; AOR 1.29 higher
severity vs. none, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.88) nor for asthma.
Conclusions: In this cohort of alcohol and drug dependent persons, there was no significant effect of chronic
medical disease on recent addiction treatment utilization. Chronic disease may not hinder or facilitate connection
to addiction treatment.

Introduction
Chronic medical diseases are long-lasting conditions,
often progressive, and often controllable with continuing
care and behavior change. In an era of increasing health
care costs [1], chronic disease stands out as a major
contributor [2] with alcohol and drug use disorders
playing an exacerbating role [3-5]. To improve popula-
tion health and reduce U.S. health care costs, particular
attention must be paid to the role of chronic diseases,
including medical, psychiatric, and substance use
disorders.
Substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent in about
9% of the U.S. population, but only 10% of those indivi-
duals access addiction treatment [6]. Although medical
needs were not explicitly mentioned in this household

survey as a reason for not accessing addiction treatment
[6], medical needs may interfere with other priorities.
For example, chronic medical conditions could cause
functional limitations that preclude access to other
health care. Interference from pressing medical condi-
tions may thus contribute to perceived unimportance of
addiction treatment among the 94% of people [6]
deemed in need but who reported they did not need it.
To enhance care of both chronic medical diseases and
addiction, it is important to better understand their
relationships.
More than 40% of the U.S. population is estimated to
have at least one chronic medical disease [2,7], with pre-
valence higher for women and increasing dramatically
with age [7]. Chronic medical disease is related to 70%
of all U.S. deaths [2], and accounts for more than 75%
of health care costs [2] and high out of pocket health
care spending [7]. Diabetes, hypertension, and high cho-
lesterol comprise nearly a third of all chronic conditions
[7], and just seven conditions account for about one-
fourth of annual outpatient visits and hospital discharges
[8].
Chronic disease may have unexpected consequences
on healthcare utilization, potentially reducing treatment
of unrelated disorders, perhaps due to less time avail-
able, complexity of navigating multiple problems at
once, or a preference to focus on the most troublesome
problem [9]. In practice, however, perhaps due to more
frequent interaction with medical providers, mental dis-
orders are more often detected among patients with
chronic medical diseases than among other patients
[10]. Physician awareness of a substance abuse problem
also is more likely when the person has episodic or
chronic medical illness, however SUDs remain undiag-
nosed by primary care physicians in nearly half of
patients seeking addiction treatment [11].
It is well documented that SUDs cause or exacerbate
certain medical conditions and increase their costs
[3,12-16]. Incidence for many chronic medical diseases,
including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic liver
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
pain, and stroke is elevated, and for some disorders
more than doubled, among people with SUDs [17-20].
Many more conditions are worsened by, have their man-
agement impaired by, or are attributable to SUDs [21].
Chronic conditions are prevalent even in younger indivi-
duals with SUDs [22]. These findings highlight the
importance of medical management as an essential ele-
ment of addiction treatment [23] particularly in early
recovery [24].
Several examples of this complex interplay are
reported in the literature. Alcohol use disorders
increased medical illness complexity in a primary care
population, even after controlling for medical morbidity,
initial primary care utilization, and current medical care
utilization [25]. Alcohol use disorders also were related
to inconsistent attendance and less complex services for
the chronic medical disease, suggesting that medical
care may be less accessible for the comorbid population,
who may require an increased focus on the complexities
of care [26]. Among patients receiving diabetes care in
the Department of Veterans Affairs, those who also had
SUDs or mental illness had more diabetes complications
[27]. Although SUDs have been linked to higher utiliza-
tion of primary, specialty, and emergency medical ser-
vices [25], there are few studies of how presence of
complex medical disorders affects addiction treatment
utilization.
Chronic medical diseases require regular and longitu-
dinal care and self-management for effective treatment
[28-30]. When chronic diseases include SUDs, care and
treatment of both the medical and addiction disorders
may affect access to care and the ability to focus on
both conditions. An integrated approach could lead to
effective treatment for all conditions [29], yet little is
known about how chronic medical disease affects addic-
tion treatment utilization. Chronic disease could cause
functional limitations that interfere with an individual's
ability to access addiction treatment, or alternatively
could increase interaction with the health care system
and perhaps addiction treatment. Involvement in addic-
tion treatment could lead to linkage with medical care
and effective attention to a chronic medical problem.
The objective of this paper is to evaluate the association
between the presence of chronic medical disease and
recent addiction treatment utilization among adults with
substance dependence.
Methods
Data Source and Sample
Data are from baseline interviews with 563 alcohol and/
or drug-dependent adults enrolled in the AHEAD
(Addiction Health Evaluation And Disease management)
study, a randomized controlled trial testing the effective-
ness of a chronic disease management program for sub-
stance dependence in primary care.
Study recruitment occurred from a free-standing inpa-
tient detoxification unit (74% of enrolled subjects), pri-
mary care clinics and the emergency department in the
urban medical center where the study was located (10%)
and the community by advertising on buses and in
newspapers (16%); subjects were recruited between Sep-
tember 2006 and September 2008.
Adults were eligible if they had (1) a diagnosis of cur-
rent alcohol or drug dependence as assessed by the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short
Form (CIDI-SF) [31]; (2) past 30 day drug use or heavy
alcohol use (defined as 4 standard drinks for women,

5 for men at least twice; or >14 drinks per week for
women, >21 drinks per week for men, in an average
week in the past month); and (3) were willing to estab-
lish or continue primary medical care at the study loca-
tion. Subjects were excluded if they could not provide
contact information for tracking purposes; were not flu-
ent in English or Spanish; had specific plans to leave the
area that would preclude in-person research assess-
ments; were pregnant; or had a Mini-Mental State
Examination [32] score <21.
Trained research associates administered the standar-
dized baseline research assessment and assured confi-
dentiality. Data collected include sociodemographics,
substance use and related problems, anxiety, depression,
health questions, and medical and addiction service use.
Subjects were compensated for their study participation
after completing baseline study procedures.
The Institutional Review Board approved the study.
Additional privacy protection was secured by a Certifi-
cate of Confidentiality issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services.
Chronic Disease and Other Medical Condition Measures
Subjects were asked if a doctor had ever told them they
had any of a series of medical conditions. A number of
these conditions were included on a chronic disease
comorbidity questionnaire validated by Katz et al. [33],
which is a self-report version of the medical record-
based Charlson Comorbidity Index [34]. The Katz ques-
tionnaire includes myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, peripheral vascular, stroke or other cere-
brovascular disease, COPD, ulcer disease, diabetes,
renal, connective tissue disease, and other conditions
(dementia, liver disease, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer,
AIDS). Scoring replicates the Charlson Comorbidity
Index, which empirically weighted severity by disease (e.
g., cerebrovascular = 1, moderate or severe renal disease
= 2, AIDS or metastatic solid tumor = 6), based on 1-
year adjusted relative risk for mortality [34]. The comor-
bidity score is the weighted sum of the specified
conditions.
The main independent variable, chronic disease status,
is a 3-category variable which classified comorbidity
scores as: none; only one condition of lowest severity
(Katz = 1); or, more than one condition of lowest sever-
ity or one or more condition(s) of higher severity (Katz
> 1). Asthma was considered in separate secondary ana-
lyses, as an example of a specific symptomatic condition,
selected due to its high prevalence in the sample; it is
also included in the Katz questionnaire, as part of
COPD, with a weight of 1. Asthma is a common comor-
bidity among urban young to middle-age adults, reflect-
ing the age range common for addiction, whereas other
common chronic diseases such as heart disease are less
common in young populations. Two other common
chronic conditions in this population, hepatitis and
hypertension, were prevalent but are often asymptomatic
to the patient, and thus were not evaluated in the cur-
rent analyses.
Additional secondary independent variables were used
to evaluate whether broader health status significantly
predicted addiction treatment utilization: the single item
self-report health status from the SF-12 [35] (excellent/
very good/good, fair/poor) and physical health-related
functioning and quality of life as determined by the SF-
12 Physical Component Score (PCS) (continuous 0-100
scale).
Addiction Treatment Utilization Measures
The primary outcome was any addiction treatment
based on self-report, defined as any treatment for addic-
tion (excluding detoxification) in the 3 months prior to
study enrollment in any of the following: residential pro-
gram for alcohol or drug treatment; outpatient full-day/
partial hospital program; outpatient with a psychiatrist,
other doctor, or other healthcare professional (e.g.,
counselor); or by taking medication to prevent drinking
or drug use. Two secondary outcomes were the counts
of outpatient addiction treatment days (at a full-day/par-
tial hospital or with a psychiatrist, other doctor, or other
healthcare professional including counselors) and nights
in a residential program for alcohol or other drug treat-
ment in the prior 3 months based on self-report at the
baseline assessment. These measures were adapted from
the COMBINE study Form 90 [36]. Self-report is known
to be a reliable way of obtaining treatment utilization
information among people with substance use disorders
[37,38].
Covariates
Demographic variables included age, gender, and race/
ethnicity. Current type of substance dependence is a 3-
category variable indicating either alcohol dependence
with heavy alcohol use in the past 30 days, any drug
dependence with drug use in the past 30 days, or both.
Alcohol and drug dependence were determined using
the CIDI-SF alcohol and drug modules [31]; heavy alco-
hol use in the past month was indicated by 4 or more
drinks per day or 15 or more drinks per average week
for women, and 5 or more drinks per day or 22 or more
drinks per week for men. The regression models
included other variables that may affect addiction treat-
ment utilization: recruitment from a detoxification pro-
gram (versus from medical care or the community),
criminal justice involvement (any arrest, probation, par-
ole, pretrial release, diversion program or incarceration
in the past 3 months), homeless (any time living in a
shelter or on the streets in the past 3 months),

unemployed (usual pattern past 3 months), having
health insurance (including Medicaid), current smoker,
and anxiety in the past week (Beck Anxiety Index [39]
scores: low = 0-21, moderate = 22-35, or high = 36 or
higher).
Statistical Methods
Secondary data analysis of the AHEAD study baseline
data was conducted. Descriptive statistics were obtained
and Spearman correlations were used to evaluate poten-
tial collinearity between independent variables and cov-
ariates. No pair of variables included in the same
regression model was highly correlated (r > 0.40). Multi-
variate regression models were used to evaluate the
effect of presence of chronic disease on addiction treat-
ment utilization, adjusting for covariates defined above.
The primary outcome of any addiction treatment was
modeled using logistic regression, with odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals calculated. The distributions
for outpatient addiction treatment days and residential
nights, which are count variables, were skewed with
many zeros and long tails, thus models assuming nor-
mality were inappropriate and overdispersed Poisson
regression models were used [40]. The Pearson chi-
square correction was used to account for overdisper-
sion. The magnitudes of association between measures
of chronic disease and utilization were quantified for the
Poisson models using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with
95% confidence intervals. IRR is interpreted as the ratio
of the number of outpatient days (or residential nights)
for the exposed group of interest (e.g., any chronic dis-
ease) versus the reference group (no chronic disease).
The null value of no association for the IRR is equal to
1. An IRR >1 indicates that chronic disease is associated
with more treatment utilization.
Multivariate models were fit separately for each
dependent variable (any addiction treatment, outpatient
days, and residential nights) and for each key indepen-
dent variable (chronic disease, asthma, health status, and
PCS). The primary analyses using the Katz score
included 498 subjects with complete data on outcomes,
the main independent variable, and covariates; second-
ary models included the same 498 subjects. Power cal-
culations assumed that 27% of subjects without chronic
disease utilized addiction treatment (based on the
observed data), giving our study approximately 80%
power to detect an odds ratio as small as 1.9 for those
with one chronic disease of lowest severity and an odds
ratio as small as 2.1 for those with one chronic disease
of higher severity or multiple chronic diseases. Thus,
power was sufficient for effects that were clinically
meaningful. All analyses were conducted using two-
sided tests and a significance level of 0.05, using SAS
software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Addiction Treatment
At baseline, 28% of subjects had been in addiction treat-
ment in the prior 3 months, excluding detoxification
(Table 1). The 97 patients (17%) who had outpatient
treatment in the prior 3 months attended a median of 5
days (interquartile range 3-13). The 70 patients (12%)
with residential treatment in the past 3 months attended
a median of 23 nights (interquartile range 8-45).
Chronic Disease, Physical Health and Other Medical
Conditions
Overall, two thirds of subjects had no chronic disease,
20% had one chronic disease of lower severity, and 14%
had one of higher severity or multiple diseases (Table
2). One third of subjects reported their health status to
be only poor or fair. The mean Physical Comorbidity
Score is 41.7 (SD = 8.4) (the general population norm is
50 [35]).
Subjects reported a wide range of medical conditions
(Table 2). Hepatitis was reported by nearly one third of
subjects, the most common single condition. Hyperten-
sion was reported by 21% of subjects and about 20%
reported asthma. Ten to thirteen percent of subjects
reported skin infections, pneumonia, anemia or seizures.
Five to ten percent reported tachycardia, gastritis, dia-
betes, COPD, ulcer, or tuberculosis. Few (2-5%) reported
rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathy, heart conditions,
stroke, HIV, pancreatitis, cancer, poor kidney function
or cirrhosis, and remaining conditions were even more
rare.
Effect of Chronic Disease on Addiction Treatment
Utilization
In multivariate regression analyses (Table 3), no signifi-
cant effect was detected for the main independent vari-
able of chronic disease status on the odds of attending
addiction treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.88 for
lower severity vs. no chronic disease, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.60, 1.28; AOR 1.29 for higher severity vs.
no chronic disease, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.88). Similarly, no sig-
nificant effect of chronic disease status was detected on
number of outpatient days or residential nights.
For the primary outcome of any addiction treatment
utilization (Model 1), being black was a negative factor,
and having health insurance and severe anxiety were
positively associated with any addiction treatment. Being
female and having severe anxiety were positively asso-
ciated with number of outpatient days, and recruitment
from a detoxification facility was a negative factor
(Model 2). Being black was a negative factor for residen-
tial nights (Model 3).
Similar results were found for the secondary inde-
pendent variables of asthma and PCS, with neither sig-
nificantly associated with any of the addiction
treatment measures. Fair or poor health status was
negatively associated with any addiction treatment and
with outpatient addiction treatment, but not with resi-
dential treatment. Table 4 summarizes the results for
each of the secondary independent variables (from
separate regression models) on each of the outcome
variables.

smoking, and severity of recent anxiety. Nor was addic-
tion treatment associated with asthma or physical func-
tion and quality of life. These findings held for any
addiction treatment and for quantity of treatment ser-
vices received. Only perceived health status, which is a
subjective measure, was associated with less addiction
treatment utilization. It is encouraging to note that
chronic disease itself may not be a barrier to addiction
treatment.
On the other hand, it also appears that chronic medi-
cal disease did not increase addiction treatment partici-
pation in this cohort. People with chronic disease are
often connected to the medical treatment system, but
the acute focus of episodic care may not extend to pro-
viding assistance or motivation for these patients to
access addiction treatment. This may be a missed
opportunity for medical providers to encourage their
patients to seek addiction treatment given that the self-
reported perception of health status was frequently only
fair or poor. The lack of a significant positive association
between chronic disease and addiction treatment utiliza-
tion suggests that facilitated access to addiction care is
not routinely occurring. Such "reachable moments" [41]
for the individual with both chronic disease and addic-
tion are perhaps most likely when formalized linkages
between primary care and addiction treatment exist or if
the primary care doctor is willing to address addiction
with the patient [18,42]. One way to increase these
reachable moments is to encourage screening, brief
intervention, and referral to treatment approaches in the
primary care setting. Opportunities for referral to addic-
tion treatment should increase as the number of medical
visits increases. An integrated, longitudinal approach to
managing both chronic medical disease and substance
dependence is likely to be most beneficial [13,43,44].
It is worthwhile to note that no chronic diseases were
reported by two thirds of this sample of substance
dependent individuals, somewhat better than an esti-
mate of 53% with no chronic conditions in a compar-
able population 10 years earlier [22]. The lower estimate
here may be due to recruitment beyond detoxification
settings; subjects recruited from the community may be
less medically ill than those in detoxification facilities.
Most of the chronic diseases noted here had prevalence
within the range of national and state estimates [45,46].
The asthma prevalence here appears slightly higher than
the state average, but this likely reflects the higher rates
often found in inner city and African-American popula-
tions [47] and the high prevalence of current smoking
in this sample. The below average Physical Comorbidity
Score in this population is comparable to similar popu-
lations 10-15 years earlier [22,48].
Although we did not detect an association between
chronic medical variables and treatment utilization,
several other variables were significantly related to treat-
ment utilization, including several sociodemographic
variables. Health insurance was positively associated
with any addiction treatment utilization, demonstrating
an expected increase in access to treatment, but did not
reach significance for the count variables. Recruitment
from detoxification was negatively associated with out-
patient days, highlighting the severity of addiction treat-
ment needs for this group, and the expected lack of
treatment preceding detoxification entry. Psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., anxiety) was positively associated with
addiction treatment utilization reflecting other findings
in the literature [49], although this past-week measure
was collected for most individuals soon after detoxifica-
tion, so may reflect short-term anxiety symptoms rather
than a chronic disorder.
The lack of findings concerning our primary hypoth-
esis may simply be the reflection of a complex relation-
ship between chronic disease and addiction, with many
competing forces. Several opposing effects from chronic
disease may have occurred, which could collectively
show little or no effect on addiction treatment utiliza-
tion. First, individuals with chronic disease may be func-
tionally less able to access and participate in addiction
treatment, reducing the likelihood of treatment utiliza-
tion. If physical function were an important barrier, we
should have seen some effect from the PCS, which did
not occur, but it might be important to consider specific
functional limitations. By considering asthma separately,
thus removing the variability across conditions, we
might have highlighted the functional effects, but that
also did not occur. It is also possible that the severity of
addiction, as indicated by most individuals in the sample
recruited from detoxification, overshadowed any func-
tional limitations as they sought treatment; a desire to
focus on the most pressing problem has been high-
lighted in some literature [9]. Second, for a variety of
reasons, addiction treatment facilities may be less likely
to accept individuals with medical conditions, who may
require medications or have more acute medical needs.
This study could not address that question. Third,
chronic disease may interfere with the quality of treat-
ment participation; number of visits could be construed
as a proxy for this, but if chronic disease affects self-
care management this issue may go beyond what could
be considered here. Fourth, 3 months is a relatively
short time period, so may have masked any differences
that would appear with longer history of treatment utili-
zation. However, the focus here is on relative differences
in utilization, so the 3 month period should have been
sufficient to compare groups. Fifth, and alternatively,
individuals with chronic disease may be more likely to
access treatment due to their likely existing linkages
with the healthcare system. A study of women with

trauma and mental or substance use disorders found
that greater disability was associated with more outpati-
ent counseling, but not residential, group counseling or
peer treatment [50]. While referral from the healthcare
system is not a common pathway to addiction treatment
[51] the finding that physicians are more likely to know
about substance abuse if the patient has an episodic or
chronic medical condition [11] suggests that this path-
way may be more likely for these patients.
The characteristics of the study sample may have tem-
pered the potential relationships between chronic dis-
ease and addiction treatment utilization. In a relatively
young sample such as this, chronic disease is less likely,
and related problems are likely to be less severe than in
an older population. However, addiction itself may
increase such problems even in a young sample [22].
The subjects in this study are largely reflective of indivi-
duals in addiction treatment, and these results should
apply to similar cohorts. Relatively few individuals in
this sample had severe chronic disease or multiple con-
ditions, thus findings may be different in an analysis of
only individuals with chronic disease. The implications
of recruiting much of the sample during a detoxification
stay should be considered, where individuals entering
detoxification may be unlikely to have been in addiction
treatment during a period of substance use severe
enough to warrant detoxification. These findings also
represent a sample from a single site, so may be less
generalizable than recruitment from multiple sites.
A limitation is that the study may have been inade-
quately powered to detect differences of the observed
magnitude. Power calculations estimated 80% power to
detect an odds ratio as small as 2.1 for those with higher
severity chronic disease, thus it is likely that the study
was not adequately powered to detect the small
observed magnitude of association of 1.3 (for higher
severity). However, since the observed degree of associa-
tion may still be clinically meaningful, the possibility
that individuals with higher comorbidity are more likely
to utilize addiction treatment should be further studied
in a larger sample to see if a small but clinically impor-
tant effect is detectable. But the effect of greater con-
cern, interference with receiving addiction treatment
due to a chronic disease, is unlikely based on our find-
ings. Last, the current analysis relied on retrospective
data from a sample of individuals, most of whom had
recently completed detoxification. A prospective or qua-
litative study would be better able to track the likely
causal issues related to chronic disease and addiction
treatment access.
To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the role
of chronic disease in addiction treatment utilization.
Current household studies on barriers to addiction
treatment, such as SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH), do not consider medical
comorbidities, so are unable to shed light on these
underlying questions. Further research in this area is
warranted to better understand these complex issues.
The individuals in this study were, by definition, willing
to receive health care. Other populations may differ.
Also, samples with a large number of individuals with
chronic disease would allow a focus on more specific
chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, and
would allow a better consideration of other psychiatric
comorbidity. In the meantime, we highlight the conclu-
sion from these data that chronic disease is not a signifi-
cant barrier to addiction treatment utilization. While we
found no significant association between chronic medi-
cal disease and addiction treatment utilization, these
issues are complicated and we suggest prospective and
qualitative studies to further explore these complexities.
