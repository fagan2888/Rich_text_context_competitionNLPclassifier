According to the Barker hypothesis, intrauterine
growth restriction and premature delivery
adversely affect cardiovascular health in adult
life. The association of childhood hypertension as
a cardiovascular risk factor and birth weight has
been understudied. In a prospective cohort study,
the authors evaluated the effect of birth weight,
gestational age, maternal prepregnancy body
mass index (BMI), and child BMI z score at the
time of enrollment on the systolic and diastolic
blood pressure (BP) z score in 3024 (1373
women) consecutive outpatient clinic patients
aged 2.05 to 18.58 years. The latest National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was used to calculate the age-
dependent z scores. The median z scores of BMI
(+0.48, range )6.96­6.64), systolic BP (+0.41,
range )4.50­6.73), and diastolic BP (+0.34,
range )3.15­+6.73) were all significantly greater
than the NHANES III reference population.
Systolic BP z score did not correlate with birth
weight or gestational age, but did correlate with
maternal prepregnancy BMI (r=.090, P<.0001)
and BMI z score (r=.209, P<.0001). Diastolic BP
z score positively correlated with birth weight
(0.037, P=.044), gestational age (r=.052, P=.005),
BMI z score(r=.106, P<.0001), and maternal
prepregnancy BMI (r=.062, P=.0007). In contrast
to what would be expected from the Barker
hypothesis, the authors found no negative
correlation between BP z score and birth weight
or gestational age. This study suggests that a high
BMI, a big mom, and a high birth weight are
more important risk factors for hypertension
during childhood than low birth weight or
gestational age. J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich).

According to the Barker hypothesis, disturbed
intrauterine growth has a negative influence
on the development of the cardiovascular system
and favors the occurrence of hypertension in
adult life.1­3 This ``fetal origins'' hypothesis, first
proposed by Barker and colleagues and elabo-
rated by several groups during the past 15 years,
was later termed the Developmental Origins of
Adult Health and Disease (DOHaD).4,5 Since its
original formulation, the evidence for develop-
mental origins or ``prenatal programming'' of
common adult disease has been expanded from
hypertension and cardiovascular disease to chronic
kidney disease,6 asthma,7 osteoporosis,8 mental
illness9 and even cancer.10 Most of these studies
do not characterize disturbed intrauterine growth

by small-for-date babies, but rather by the
presence of low birth weight. While there are
numerous studies that established the inverse rela-
tionship between low birth weight and blood
pressure (BP) in adults, few pediatric studies
exist.11
Hypertension is the single most important risk
factor for cardiovascular events in adulthood.12
Epidemiologic and clinical data also support a
strong link between obesity and hypertension.13
Unfortunately, children in Canada rank among the
most obese children in the world. Windsor,
Ontario, and London, Ontario, rank as the 4th and
5th most obese cities in Canada, respectively.14
They reflect a large proportion of the catchment
area of Children's Hospital, London Health Sci-
ences Centre. We undertook a cross-sectional study
of children attending our institution and compared
the BP (expressed as age-independent z scores) with
body mass index (BMI) (expressed as age-indepen-
dent BMI z score), birth weight, gestational age,
and maternal prepregnancy BMI. The objective of
this study was to establish the determinants of BP z
score in childhood. To prove that the Barker
hypothesis applies to children, a negative correla-
tion between BP z score and birth weight and ges-
tational age was to be expected. If a high BMI, a
high birth weight, or maternal obesity were more
important, a positive correlation between BP z
score and these determinants was to be expected.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The investigation was a prospective cohort study
using the convenience sample of patients attending
Children's Hospital, London Health Science Centre.
After obtaining approval from the institutional eth-
ics review board (#13746E), 3024 patients attend-
ing the center (1373 females, 45.4%), aged 2.05 to
18.58 years, were recruited into the study from the
emergency department and large outpatient clinics
including orthopedic surgery, cardiology, gastroen-
terology, nephrology, endocrinology, neurology,
neurosurgery, respirology, and others. All clinics
were invited to participate; however, some small
clinics elected against participation because of
understaffing. Between 60% (orthopedic surgery
clinic) and 93% of patients or parents (emergency
department) agreed to participate in the study.
Patients younger than 2 were not considered for
this study because of the lack of reference intervals
to calculate BMI z scores. Eligible participants were
all patients who gave informed consent. Patient
enrollment commenced during a 9-month period
and 37.5% of possible patients aged 2 to 18 were
enrolled. We were unable to enroll all patients since
the emergency department recruitment only occurred
between noon and 8 pm every day. Excluded were
patients for whom no consent was obtained or
who attended the clinics outside of recruitment
hours. After obtaining written informed consent, a
questionnaire was filled out by the parents to deter-
mine birth weight, duration of pregnancy, and
maternal prepregnancy height and weight. Random
BP measurements using a standardized protocol
were taken at the clinic visits using automated
oscillometric BP machines (patient seated, calm,
second of two measurements performed 5 minutes
apart with either Walch Allyn Spot Vital Signs LXi
(Walch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY) or Dinamap
Pro 100, Pro 300, and Dinamap XL Vital Signs
Monitor (Criticon, Tampa, FL). Anthropometric
measurements (height, measured by stadiometers
[Infant stadiometer from Perspection Enterprises,
Portage, MI; otherwise Seca 242 mechanical per-
sonal measuring rod, Hanover, MD]; weight mea-
sured using a high-precision industrial scale at both
institutions [Scale-Tronix scales 6002 for wheel-
chair patients, 4802 for infants and 5002 other-
wise; Scale-Tronix, Wheaton, IL]) were obtained as
clinical routine. BMI was calculated from the ratio
of weight (kg) and the square of the height (cm).
Age-independent BMI z scores were calculated
using the methodology provided by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web site
with age- and sex-matched controls taken from the
National Center for Health Statistics (United
States). We used the most recent National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
database (1999­2002) for all patients (National
Center for Health Statistics 2000 CDC Growth
Charts: United States [accessed July 29, 2006,
at http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/]). We also
calculated height and weight z scores as well as
BP z scores using the published Box-Cox
transformations.
For a subset of 658 patients born in London, we
linked data to an existing maternal fetal database to
test agreement between the reported and measured
prepregnancy weight, height, and birth weight.
To study the effect of prepregnancy BMI and
birth weight, we classified the data according to the
following birth weight groups: birth weight <1500 g
(significant prematurity); 1500 g to 2500 g (low birth
weight); 2500 g to 4000 g (normal birth weight);
4000 g to 4500 g (mildly elevated birth weight); and
>4500 g (significantly elevated birth weight). Simi-
larly, we divided the prepregnancy BMI into
the following groups: <18.5 kg/m2 (underweight);
THE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPERTENSION VOL. 13 NO. 1 JANUARY 2011
36
18.5 kg/m2 to 25 kg/m2 (normal weight); 25 kg/m2
to 30 kg/m2 (overweight); and >30 kg/m2 (obese).
To study the effect of age after birth, we also divided
the patients into two age groups of younger than or
older than 8 years, as the effect of prematurity on
cardiovascular risk factors has been described
beyond 8 years of life.
Statistical analysis was performed with the
GRAPHPAD PRISM version 4.02 for Windows
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Contiguous
data were analyzed for normal distribution with
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Mean and stan-
dard deviation were reported for normally distrib-
uted data; otherwise, median and quartiles were
given. Simple descriptive tests were employed, using
appropriate parametric tests for normally distrib-
uted data and nonparametric tests otherwise. Com-
parison between groups was performed using
standard t test for normally distributed parameters
and the Wilcoxon signed rank test otherwise. Asso-
ciations between variables (eg, date of presentation
and BMI z score) were assessed with standard
regression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis
was also performed to control for BMI z score
when analyzing the relationship between BP z score
and birth weight. Agreement between variables
was assessed using Bland & Altman analysis. A P
value of <.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. For the current study, we only included the
3024 complete data sets of children older than
2 years, therefore no adjustments were needed for
missing values.
RESULTS
Between April 2007 and January 2008, 3024
patients were included into the study (1373 female,
45.4%). Patients were from the emergency depart-
ment (2046), the nephrology clinic (296), the cardi-
ology clinic (253), the neurology clinic (179), the
endocrinology clinic (86), and other clinics (164).
We tested for agreement between the reported
and measured parameters after linking with an
existing perinatal database in 658 cases. Spearman
rank correlation between reported and actual
prepregnancy BMI data revealed a strong positive
correlation (r=.907, P<.0001). Bland & Altman
analysis revealed a bias of 2.69%Æ9.37% for pre-
pregnancy BMI, with a median underestimation
of 0.875% of the reported prepregnancy BMI
(P<.0001). For the birth weight, Spearman rank
correlation was 0.942 (P<.0001), and Bland &
Altman analysis revealed a bias of 15Æ201 g or
0.65%Æ6.6%.
Median BP was 108/66 mm Hg. Patient charac-
teristics and appropriate z scores for all measure-
ments are summarized in Table I.
Interestingly, we found no significant correlation
between systolic BP z score and birth weight
(r=).006, P=.729, Spearman rank correlation), nor
was there a correlation with gestational age (r=.30,
P=.098, Spearman rank correlation). Systolic BP z
score correlated with diastolic BP z score (r=.556,
P<.0001, Spearman rank correlation), BMI z score
(r=.209, P<.0001, Spearman rank correlation), and
maternal prepregnancy BMI (r=.090, P<.0001,
Spearman rank correlation).
With regards to the diastolic BP z score, we
found a weak but significant positive correlation
with birth weight (r=.037, P=.044) and a weak
positive correlation with gestational age (r=.052,
P=.005, Spearman rank correlation). Better correla-
tions were found with BMI z score (r=.106,

rank correlation).
BMI z score had a positive correlation with birth
weight (r=.123, P<.0001, Spearman rank correla-
tion) and maternal prepregnancy BMI (r=.202,
P<.0001, Spearman rank correlation) and a weak
yet significant positive correlation with gestational
age (r=.060, P=.001). Maternal BMI correlated
weakly and significantly with birth weight (Spear-
man r=.079, P<.0001).
We also performed a multivariate analysis with
systolic and diastolic BP z scores taken as depen-
dent variables and the birth weight, controlling for
BMI z score. There was a significant positive corre-
lation between birth weight and BP z scores (Pillai's
Trace 0.008; Wilks Lambda, 0.008; Hotteling's
trace, 0.008; Roy's Largest Root method, 0.012).
For the between-subjects effect, we found a signifi-
cant correlation between birth weight and systolic
BP z score (0.026) as well as with diastolic BP z
score (0.018). Due to the lack of a nonparametric
test, we used a general linear model (y=A+B * BMI
z score+C * birth weight), where A, B, and C are
constants. We further considered two age groups:
8 years and younger (n=1282) and older than
8 years (n=1742). Similar multivariate analysis was
applied for the two age groups. Results found for
the younger group of patients indicated the pres-
ence of a significant positive correlation between
birth weight and BP z scores (Pillai's Trace, 0.000;
Wilks Lambda, 0.000; Hotteling's trace, 0.000.
Roy's Largest Root method, 0.000). For the
between-subjects effect, the analysis demonstrated a
significant correlation between birth weight and
systolic BP z score (0.001) as well as with diastolic
BP z score (0.000). For the older group of patients,
there was no significant correlation between birth
weight and BP z scores (Pillai's Trace, 0.064; Wilks
Lambda, 0.065; Hotteling's trace, 0.066; Roy's
Largest Root method, 0.057). We did not find a
significant correlation between birth weight and
systolic BP (0.238) or diastolic BP (0.185). Accord-
ing to the Barker hypothesis, BP should have corre-
lated negatively with the birth weight.
To address the potential for a developmental lag
for the development of hypertension secondary to
low birth weight, we compared two age groups:
younger than 8 years and older than 8 years. The
reason for choosing the cut-off of 8 years of age
stems from studies in prematurely born children in
whom hypertension typically developed beyond the
8th year of life. There was a significant difference
in the systolic BP z score between both groups
(adolescents median, 0.289; children younger than
8 years, median=0.560; P<.0001, Mann-Whitney
test) as well as the diastolic BP z scores (adolescent
median, 0.201; children younger than 8 years
+0.510; P<.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Conversely,
there was a significant difference between the
maternal prepregnancy BMI (median for adoles-
cents, 22.35 kg/m2; children younger than 8 years,
23.33 kg/m2; P<.0001, Mann-Whitney test). How-
ever, there was no correlation between birth weight
and systolic BP z score in both groups (younger
than 8 years: r=.008, P=.776; older than 8 years:
r=).013, P=.590, Spearman rank correlation)),
whereas the diastolic BP z score correlated weakly
but positively in the younger group only (r=.079,
P=.005, Spearman rank correlation).
Finally, we tested BP z scores in relationship to
various groups of birth weight and prepregnancy
BMI as outlined in the methods, using the nonpara-
metric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance test and
found significant differences in the BP z scores
among the birth weight groups (Table II). Interest-
ingly, when repeating the analysis of systolic BP for
the subgroup of patients older than 8 years, there
was no significant difference in medians of these
groups (P=.1570). The same applied for the dia-
stolic BP in the older group (P=.2139). By contrast,
there was a significant positive relationship between
the prepregnancy BMI and the systolic and diastolic
BP (Table III). This suggests that offsprings of big
moms are a greater risk factor for childhood hyper-
tension than small babies.
DISCUSSION
According to the Barker hypothesis, disturbed intra-
uterine growth and low birth weight have a negative
influence on the development of the cardiovascular
system and favors the occurrence of hypertension in
adult life. This hypothesis was not tested in children.
The current study attempts to fill this gap.
Numerous large studies have recently confirmed
the relationship between low birth weight and raised
BP, as recently elegantly reviewed by Do
¨tsch.15 The
mechanism for the development of hypertension due
to low birth weight has not been well defined, but
may include both renal16 and extrarenal mecha-
nisms. Renal mechanisms may include the reduction
of nephron number, which is encountered in patients
and animals with low birth weight.17 According to
the so-called Brenner hypothesis, this may lead
to increased arterial BP.18,19 Another important
renal mechanism is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system, which appears to be more active on a num-
ber of levels in persons with low birth weight.20

Interestingly, we did not find any relationship
between low birth weight and an elevated BP z score.
This was even true when analyzing older patients
separately.
It could be argued that the entire process of
hyperfiltration as a consequence of reduced nephron
dosing responsible for the development of hyperten-
sion might take longer than the childhood to occur.
Clearly, young adults born with a very low birth
weight have higher BP.21 The time effect, especially
when aggravated by excessive weight gain, is well
recognized.22 To test this hypothesis, we chose a cut-
off of 8 years because it has previously been shown
that low birth weight already affects BP at age 8.23
Surprisingly, we found absolutely no negative corre-
lation between birth weight and BP z score even in
the older patients analyzed separately, thereby ques-
tioning the applicability of the Barker hypothesis to
adolescents. It is important to point out that in utero
growth restriction due to famine was responsible for
the increased rate of hypertension and cardiovascular
morbidity,1,2 but we currently rarely see famine but
rather feast.
Today, we witness an unprecedented obesity epi-
demic.5 Even within our study, we were able to
demonstrate increased obesity within a single dec-
ade: both BMI z scores for children older than 8
and their mother's prepregnancy BMIs were signifi-
cantly lower than the younger children. It is possi-
ble that being leaner confounded the effect of low
birth weight; however, in the multivariate models,
there was a positive correlation between birth
weight and BMI z score. Matched with the results
presented in Table III, this would suggest an
adverse effect of high birth weight on future BP. It
is impossible to derive from the data whether this
is due to prenatal programming or the environment
in which the child grows up.
In a study of 739 children from Brazil, children
with both a low and a high birth weight had higher
BP when using covariance analysis.24 It was con-
cluded that weight gain during childhood adds to
the risk. It appears that both famine and feast dur-
ing pregnancy are unfavorable for BP. In other
words, both small babies/tiny moms and big
babies/big moms are both a risk factor. In contrast
to these findings, the data from the current study
suggest that a high prepregnancy BMI and a high
birth weight are the most important factors for
higher BP in childhood. The socioeconomical envi-
ronment in Canada and Brazil differ.
Our data raise the question of whether child-
hood hypertension could be the result of feast in
pregnancy. Prevention of hypertension might have

to start before pregnancy.25 Prepregnancy BMI,
insulin resistance during pregnancy, and weight
gain after birth are all potentially modifiable and
may well be the target to improve the overall car-
diovascular risk factors later in life.
Limitations and Strengths
About one third of patients were seen in the clinics
for chronic diseases. Certainly in the nephrology
clinic, a patient selection toward hypertension may
have occurred. Furthermore, the inclusion of hospi-
tal children could induce a potential bias from the
detrimental effect of chronic disease on the growth
parameters.26­29 However, few datasets contain
prepregnancy, pregnancy, and childhood informa-
tion. Without all such time points, life course effects
will remain only partially understood.30 This study
is unique in that it enlists the necessary information
and is verified from an existing perinatal database.
Despite expected growth retardation, height as well
as BMI z scores in our study group were higher than
their American counterparts. Particularly, the emer-
gency department and orthopaedic clinic patients,
who reflect a more normal patient cohort, were
particularly taller than the NHANES III study group.
A large study sample also enhances the validity of
our observations. A mixed patient representation
from different clinics minimizes a potential selection
bias. Nonetheless, the sample taken from patients
attending our hospital represents a bias with a pre-
dominantly white patient clientele from a predomi-
nantly blue-collar background. Unfortunately, we
did not collect ethnicity, socioeconomic background,
or other descriptors of our patient cohort.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggests that the potentially modifiable
factor of BMI forms the single most important
determinant for BP z score. In less than a decade,
the problem of high BMI z score is increasing, and
focusing on effective prevention and intervention is
a priority. It appears that a high pregnancy BMI
contributes to elevated BP. Targeting a healthy
prepregnancy BMI also has to become a priority.
The effect of the unmodifiable risk factor of low
birth weight is of lesser importance. Our study sug-
gests that big moms may be a more significant risk
factor for childhood hypertension than small babies.
