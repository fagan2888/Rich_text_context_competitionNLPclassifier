Introduction
The concept of medical or health pluralism is applied loosely
in social science research. The concept of pluralistic health
environment often differs from studies and research on the
subject based on place or location of studies (Amegbor,
2014). Studies in western industrialized societies often use
the concept in reference to the parallel existence of a bio-
medical health care system and other forms of natural and
scientific health care (postmodern scientific health care)
such as chiropractic, naturopathy, homoeopathy, and aroma-
therapy (Raffaetà, 2013; Stevenson, Britten, Barry, Bradley,
& Barber, 2003; Unschuld, 1980). This conception most
often ignores the indigenous health care system of natives
such the Aboriginal people of North America, Europe, and
Australia. Similarly, in most developing countries, especially
sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of medical/health pluralism
frequently refers to the existence of western biomedical ther-
apies, and indigenous healing practices and traditions (Digby
& Sweet, 2012; Hampshire & Owusu, 2013; Pantelic et al.,
2015; Ribera, 2007; Twumasi, 1979). The conception of
which healing practices constitute a pluralistic health envi-
ronment is confined to professional care therapies. However,
studies increasingly point to the predominance of self-care
and/or home care as the major health care management
option for most people in both the developed and developing
worlds (Asenso-Okyere, Anum, Osei-Akoto, & Adukonu,
1998; Chenge et al., 2014; Cocks & Dold, 2000; Stevenson
et al., 2003). Thus, self-care is not given its due diligence as
a vital health care sector, in the discourse on health care sys-
tems and medical/health pluralism.
Research and literature on the phenomenon of medical/
health pluralism in Ghana usually acknowledge two systems
of care--a dual approach (Barimah, 2013; Sato, 2012a; Tabi,
Powell, & Hodnicki, 2006; Twumasi, 1979). This dual
approach to medical/health pluralism--biomedicine versus
the others--shrouds the reality of the health care system of
most contemporary societies, as well as treatment-seeking
behavior of patients. As indicated earlier, the dual approach
downplays the vital role and the predominance of self-care as
a major treatment system in any pluralistic health society
(Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998; Chipwaza et al., 2014; Danso-
Appiah et al., 2010; Kleinman, 1978; Stevenson et al., 2003).

An Assessment of Care-Seeking Behavior
in Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa District: A
Triple Pluralistic Health Sector Approach
P. M. Amegbor1
Abstract
Discussions and studies on Ghana's pluralistic health care system usually ignore or downplay self-care as a crucial sector in
this system of care. In view of this, this study uses a triple sector approach of the pluralistic health care system as advocated
by Kleinman to assess care-seeking behaviors of residents in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa District (Ghana). The results of
cross-tabulation analysis demonstrate that respondents' general care­seeking behavior is different from the type of care
sought for last illness before the study. Data for the study were obtained from 227 urban and rural respondents in the study
district in 2013. The findings indicate that factors such as geographic location, health insurance, and perception of the cost of
professional care had a bearing on residents' general care­seeking behavior. However, age, sex, relationship status, economic
status, and proximity to nearest biomedical care service influenced the type of treatment sought for last illness. The approach
use of the study demonstrates that self-care remains a general avenue of care for residents, whereas in times of severe illness,
respondents often rely on professional biomedical care. The use of professional indigenous care services is generally low due
to the financial burden associated with its use.

Whereas some studies have acknowledged and explored the
critical role of self-care in treatment-seeking behavior of
patients in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa, such studies usu-
ally do not emphasize this treatment avenue as part of the
health care structure. In addition, the use of the dual approach
skews reality about patients' preference and choice of treat-
ment in favor of the alternative and/or traditional medicine
(Amoah, Sandjo, Bazzo, Leite, & Biavatti, 2014; Anyinam,
1987a; Dahlberg & Trygger, 2009; Rutebemberwa et al.,
2013). This misrepresentation is largely due to confinement
of biomedical care to professional and institutional-based
care, whereas indigenous/traditional medicine is loosely
applied care in professional setting and self-care setting. To
tackle these shortfalls and the conceptual challenges associ-
ated with the use of dual systems approach, this study adopts
a modified version of Kleinman's model of health care sys-
tem (Kleinman, 1978) to assess treatment-seeking behaviors
of people in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of Ghana.
In view of this, I use a modified version of Kleinman's model
to assess preference and actual use of professional biomedi-
cal, professional indigenous, and self-care forms of health
care in addressing acute illness in the Asikuma-Odoben-
Brakwa district of Ghana. Furthermore, I synchronize this
new modified model of health care system with the existing
behavioral model of access and use of health care services to
enhance the discourse and knowledge on exiting studies.
The remainder of the study is five substantive sections.
The section "A Triple-Systems Model Approach to Medical/
Health Pluralism in Ghana" covers the adopted pluralistic
health system models and the behavioral model of access to
health care. It further discusses the logic in blending the two
models into a new model of access and use of health care
services with a pluralistic outlook. The section "Study
Context" gives the context of the study area and rational for
choosing it. The section "Method and Data Analysis"
explains the methods of data collections, techniques of sam-
pling, measures of study variables, and statistical analyses
used. The section "Results" presents a summary of the results
of the descriptive, bivariate (cross-tabulation), and the multi-
nomial logistic regression models generated from the study
data. The section "Discussion" critical discusses the findings
in relation to the conceptual framework and existing litera-
ture on the subject. It further delves into the limitations of the
study. The "Conclusion" section discusses the implication of
the study and the model for future research and discourse on
health-seeking behavior in pluralistic health environment
A Triple-Systems Model Approach to
Medical/Health Pluralism in Ghana
The Ghana health care system such as many contemporary
systems of care is usually described as pluralistic in practice
and approach (Abel, Busia, & Med, 2005; Aikins, 2002;
Aikins, Boynton, & Atanga, 2010; Tenkorang, 2016). As a
whole, the health care system is characterized by a diversity
of health knowledge, beliefs, and practices. Ghanaians use a
plethora of cures and remedies to treat and meet their every-
day health care needs (Amegbor, 2014; Gyasi et al., 2016).
Nonetheless, these remedies for treating acute illnesses and
complex health conditions are drawn from two main medical
traditions: biomedical and traditional (indigenous). Whereas
the former system of care was introduced into the country
through Christian missionary activities and colonialism, the
latter is embedded in the socioculture orientation of Ghanaian
societies (Hampshire & Owusu, 2013; Twumasi, 1979,
1981). Researchers are often been intrigued by the parallel
traditions of these medical systems, yet their integration by
patients in addressing health problems (Aikins, 2003;
Kroeger, 1983; Moshabela, Schneider, Silal, & Cleary, 2012;
Sato, 2012b). The phenomenon is termed as "healer shop-
ping" (Aikins, 2005; Kroeger, 1983). A large volume of lit-
erature exists on the predominant use of the indigenous
medicalsystemanditsremedies(Albertyn,Berg,Numanoglu,
& Rode, 2015; Anyinam, 1987a; de Wet, Ramulondi, &
Ngcobo, 2016; Good, 1987; Pouliot, 2011; Tabi et al., 2006;
Twumasi, 1979). However, the biomedical health care sys-
tem has a monopolistic hold as the official and legally sanc-
tioned medical system in Ghana and many other sub-Saharan
Africa countries (Amegbor, 2014).
Reports estimate that more than 60% to 80% of Ghanaians
and residents of other sub-Saharan Africa countries use
indigenous medical remedies in meeting their everyday
health care needs (McFarlane, 2015; Thorsen & Pouliot,
2016; Vadi, 2007; WHO, 2002). It is widely acknowledged
that access to biomedical health care remains elusive to many
patients, especially the poor and rural dwellers in Ghana and
the subregion (Aikins & Marks, 2007; Helmchen & Lo
Sasso, 2010; Powell-Jackson, Hanson, Whitty, & Ansah,
2014). Scholars and researchers criticize the structure of bio-
medical care, and opine its inability to reach the mass is due
to social distance, economic and financial constraints, and
the uneven distribution of health and medical resources in
this part of the world (Haddad, Makin, Pattinson, & Forsyth,
2015; Harris et al., 2011; Jørgensen, 2008; Kissah-Korsah,
2008; Mills et al., 2012). For instance, research in the 1980s
and early 1990s observed a drastic fall in the use of biomedi-
cal care among Ghanaians due to the introduction of user
fees during the structural adjustment era (Anyinam, 1994;
Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998; Nyonator & Kutzin, 1999).
Interestingly, this period coincided with global acknowledg-
ment of indigenous medical practices and their role in pro-
moting access primary health care, as well as, improving
overall health (Gilbert & Gilbert, 2004; Green & Makhubu,
1984; Ndhlala, Stafford, Finnie, & Van Staden, 2011). During
this period, Ghana passed several decrees and laws aimed at
regulating and ensuring the safety of indigenous medical
practices (Romero-Daza, 2002). These legislations, as well
as efforts to integrate the indigenous healing system into the
national health care system, contributed to the transforma-
tions of the indigenous medical practices (Anyinam, 1987b;
Amegbor 3
Romero-Daza, 2002). Hitherto, the indigenous medical prac-
tices were usually noncommercial communal-based healing
systems, and hence were described as affordable, culturally
acceptable, and physically close to it users (Ae-Ngibise
et al., 2010; Anyinam, 1987a; Muela, Mushi, & Ribera,
2000). For instance, some studies assert that in some com-
munities, money or paying for health destroys the potency of
the medicine (Bierlich, 1999; van der Geest, 1992). These
policies and licensing of indigenous medical practitioners
coupled with direct out-of-pocket payment for biomedical
care provided an ideal incentive for professionalization of
healers through setting of standards (Janes, 1999). The end
result was the commodification of some aspects of the indig-
enous healing practices, particularly herbal and plant medi-
cine (Flint, 2001; Han, 2001; Hsu, 2009).
The commodification of indigenous medical care systems
created a professional body of healers whose activities are
highly formal and commercially oriented. Thus, the current
indigenous medical care system is not as that purported by
early researchers, such as Anyinam (1987a), Good (1987),
and Twumasi (1975). In addition, certain key policies such as
the introduction of a national risk-pooling health insurance
scheme and community health posts (CHPs) in deprived
rural areas have changed the landscape of access to biomedi-
cal health care (Aryeetey et al., 2013; Fenenga et al., 2015;
Jehu-Appiah et al., 2011). For instance, the National Health
Insurance Scheme (NHIS) aims to mitigate direct out-of-
pocket payment for biomedical health care, thus reducing the
financial burden and constraints of Ghanaians especially the
poor and vulnerable (Gobah & Zhang, 2011; Witter &
Garshong, 2009). Likewise, the introduction of community-
based health planning and services (CHPS) seeks to reduce
geographical distance between people in deprived communi-
ties and biomedical care services, as well as, foster an inclu-
sive program of community-based health services (Akazili,
Garshong, Aikins, Gyapong, & McIntyre, 2012; Fenny,
Asante, Enemark, & Hansen, 2015; Kuuire, Bisung,
Rishworth, Dixon, & Luginaah, 2015). The CHPS health
centers in these deprived communities are crucial for pri-
mary health care needs while district- and regional-based
hospitals and clinics provide secondary services to residents
in times of urgent need (Fenny et al., 2015; Tawiah et al.,
2016). Studies have explored how these transformations are
improving or affecting access to health care, albeit this has
not been done as a pluralistic health system perspective. The
continued use of a dual health care systems approach to ana-
lyze treatment-seeking behaviors of Ghanaians (Jørgensen,
2008; Kissah-Korsah, 2008; Sato, 2012a), as well as a mono-
care systems approach (either biomedical or indigenous care;
Gyasi, Mensah, & Siaw, 2015), shrouds the current reality of
the health scape in Ghana.
To mitigate these challenges while acknowledging the
transformations that have characterized both the biomedical
and indigenous health care systems in Ghana, this study
adopts a modified version of Kleinman's (1978) model of
health care systems in a pluralistic society. In his model,
Kleinman argues that the health care system in a pluralistic
environment comprises of three overlapping parts: the popu-
lar, the professional, and the folk sectors (Kleinman, 1978;
Stevenson et al., 2003). The popular sector refers to informal
care and treatment in the family or home context, including
social network and community activities (Kleinman, 1978).
The professional sector comprises professional healers in the
scientific (biomedical) and indigenous healing traditions,
while the folk sector is a nonprofessional healing specialist
often classified into secular and sacred groups (Kleinman,
1978). In his work, he acknowledges those studies that over-
emphasize the folk sector while playing down the popular
sector. This assertion highlights the neglect of the popular
sector in pluralistic health care system discourse. Although
this model is more than three decades old, compared with the
dual model (posited by Good, Hunter, Katz, & Katz, 1979, &
Twumasi, 1979), it accurately and adequately reflects the
current Ghanaian health care system.
In this study's model (Figure 1), the popular sector is con-
ceptualized as the self-care sector of the Ghanaian health care
system. Like Kleinman's popular sector, the self-care is a
nonspecialist popular arena of the Ghanaian health care sys-
tem, where disease and illness are first identified, defined,
and decision on treatments is made. The use of self-medica-
tion or self-treatment as the first health care option for patients
is not only peculiar to Ghanaians or residents of sub-Saharan
Figure 1. Study's conceptual framework.

Africa (SSA) (Bussing, Koro-Ljungberg, Williamson, Gary,
& Wilson Garvan, 2006; Chung et al., 2011; Ramdas, 2012;
Stevenson et al., 2003). A large volume of literature points to
the large proportion of patient's in western industrialized
nations and other parts of the global south who depend on this
sector for their basic health care need (Paterson et al., 2012;
Stevenson et al., 2003). In Ghana, studies indicate that a large
section of the Ghanaian population heavily rely on this form
of treatment for common illness such as malaria, fever, pains,
and aches. The treatment of diseases and illness in this sector
involves the use remedies, drugs, and treatment resources
from both the biomedical and indigenous medical systems
(Beiersmann et al., 2007; Chipwaza et al., 2014; Tabi et al.,
2006). Existing literature on health-seeking behavior in
Ghana and other parts of SSA reports the use of biomedical
drugs for self-medication, especially pain killers purchased
from "chemical/drug stores" (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998;
Dzator & Asafu-Adjaye, 2004; Febir et al., 2016; Goodman
et al., 2007; Goodman, Kachur, Abdulla, Bloland, & Mills,
2009; Kassam, Collins, Liow, & Rasool, 2015). For instance,
a recent study by Febir et al. (2016) reveals that members in
the study community purchased drugs they deemed appropri-
ate from drug stores for their perceived health condition or
alternatively relied on the advice of the vendor. The study
similarly noticed the use of herbal preparation or left over
pharmaceutical drugs from previous illness for treatment.
Furthermore, the study's model distinguishes between
professional care in a biomedical care and indigenous care
settings. This distinction is appropriate given the health
care system in Ghana has not formally integrated healers
from biomedical and indigenous health care system. The
system of integration in Ghana is what Stepan (1983) terms
the tolerate system. This system of integration gives legal
recognition to scientific-based indigenous medical prac-
tices or remedies such as herbal medicine, while the nonsci-
entific aspects are tolerated by the law. However, the
Chinese health care system, which was the context of
Kleinman's study, has a formal integration of traditional
Chinese medicine and biomedical treatment--that is an
inclusive system of pluralistic health care integration
(Kleinman, 1978; Stepan, 1983). Thus, the professional
biomedical health care sector in this model refers to the
official legally backed health care system in Ghana. Care
and treatment in this sector are provided by professionals
such as physicians, nurses, midwives, and surgeons who
are trained in formal education systems. In addition, care
and treatment are provided in hospitals, clinics, or CHPs
(Fenny et al., 2015). The professional indigenous care sec-
tor as used in this model refers to both licensed and com-
munally recognized indigenous healers including faith
healers whose activities are generally commercially ori-
ented. As noted earlier, although some indigenous healers
and their practices are licensed and recognized by law, they
are not part of the formal health care structure, and hence
their separation from biomedical professionals.
In furthering current understanding on care-seeking
behaviors in a pluralistic health environment, the study syn-
chronizes the triple systems approach of Kleinman and
Buor's behavioral model of health care access and utiliza-
tion. Buor's (2003) behavioral model of health care utiliza-
tion (Buor, 2003) is an improvement ofAndersen's behavioral
model. Andersen's model generally recognizes three group
factors (predisposing, enabling, and need) that influence
patient's access and use of health service (Aday & Andersen,
1974; Andersen, 2008). In addition to these three broad fac-
tors, Buor's model incorporates spatial characteristics, pro-
vider characteristics, and restrictive factors (combination of
government policy that determines service, location, and dis-
tance of coverage) to the list of factors that influence and
determine user's behavior (Buor, 2003, 2004). The model
opines that the use of health care services is dependent on
broad socioeconomic, spatial, health, and provider character-
istics operating in an organized user environment (Buor,
2003). The model used in this study does not exhaustively
include all factors identified by Andersen and Buor as influ-
ences of patient's health-seeking behavior. Nevertheless, the
model includes key geographical, sociodemographic, eco-
nomic, and restrictive factors (health financing and cost of
care).
Study Context
The study district, Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa, is located in
the north-central portion of the Central Region of Ghana.
With a total land cover area of 884.84 km2, it lies between
latitude 5° 51 and 5° 52, and longitude 1° 50 and 1° 5
West. The district lies in the moist semideciduous rainforest
vegetation cover of Ghana; hence, agriculture is the predom-
inant occupation. It is currently estimated that agriculture
employs for 65% of the district's labor force (Ghana
Statistical Service [GSS], 2014a). In addition, about 52% of
the population engaged in other economic activities engage
in agriculture as a secondary occupation (GSS, 2014a). The
study district has an estimated population of 112,706 per
Ghana's 2010 Population and Housing Census (GSS, 2012),
of which 48.2% are males and 51.8% are female. Like most
rural Akan communities, household units in the district are
still traditional; that is, extended family members often live
in the same housing units (popularly termed compound
houses). Individual family dwelling or nuclear family house-
hold systems account for a third (33.4%) of the total house-
hold number in the district (GSS, 2014a). In addition, there
are more females per household than males.
The district is characterized as the most deprived district in
the Central Region according to the 2006 Ghana Health Service
regional report (Ghana Health Service, 2007). Current national
and regional public health policy planning coupled with the
distribution of health care facilities in Ghana are largely urban
biased and hence neglect or do not favor most rural communi-
ties including Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district. The entire
Amegbor 5
district is served by one hospital, two clinics, and 10 CHPs.
These facilities are manned by nine medical officers, six medi-
cal assistants, with the help of 23 midwives, 18 staffed nurses,
12 enrolled nurses (student nurses), and eight public health
nurses. Furthermore, the main hospital--Our Lady of Grace
Hospital--also serves surrounding communities and districts,
which places an undue burden on the limited human resources
in the facility, resulting in long waiting hours for most patients
(Amegbor, 2014). For instance, the ophthalmology clinic in the
district hospital (Our Lady of Grace) is the main eye care facil-
ity serving the district and more than five surrounding and
nearby districts such as Assin North and South districts, Agona
East and West districts, Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam district, and
the Gomoa districts (Abokyi, Koffuor, Abu, Kyei, & Abraham,
2012).
Coupled with these health care provision challenges, the
district has one of the highest major population growth indi-
cators as well as mortality cases in the region (GSS, 2014b).
For instance, the total fertility rate is 4.68 (the highest in the
region), whereas deaths in household and crude death rates
are 1,114 and 9.88, respectively (GSS, 2012, 2014a). In addi-
tion, borehole, pump, and tube well constitute major sources
of drinking water (37.8%), with an additional estimated
18.2% of households resorting to rivers and streams for their
water consumption supply (GSS, 2014a). These health and
development challenges make the district an ideal location to
assess health care usage behavior in a pluralistic framework
that incorporates self-care/home-care (nonprofessional
administered care).
Method and Data Analysis
The primary data used in this study are from a cross-sectional
survey conducted in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of
Ghana between June and July 2013. The survey was con-
ducted in relation to an MPhil thesis on health-seeking
behavior in a pluralistic health care environment. The survey
solicited the views and responses of 227 respondents in three
communities--Asikuma, Bedum, and Fosuansa--in the dis-
trict. These communities were selected through a cluster area
and lottery sampling techniques. Recognizing intraregional
differences in the study district in terms of population size
and social amenities allocations, that is, the degree of urban-
ity, I grouped the communities in the district into three settle-
ment categories--urban areas, semiurban or semiurban
areas, and rural areas. The list of the communities in the dis-
trict was obtained from the district assembly planning office,
and the help of the planning officer was sought in determin-
ing which communities fit the set categories based on the
district planning agenda. This was also complemented with
the criteria for rural­urban classification used by GSS--pop-
ulation size and predominant occupation. Thus, communities
with a population size of 10,000 or more were placed in an
urban category, while those with a population of 6,000 and
below were placed in the rural category. I proceeded with
using lottery sampling technique to draw one potential data
collection site from the urban category (there were only three
communities in this category), and two potential data collec-
tion sites from the rural category. The target population for
the study was all persons aged 18 years or above in the three
selected communities--Asikuma (urban community), and
Bedum and Fosuansa (rural communities). In each cluster, an
adult aged 18 or older in a randomly selected household or
workplace was sampled to answer a face-to-face survey
administered.
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the
Department of Sociology and Human Geography, University
of Oslo, and the supervisor for the MPhil project. With the
help of the district coordinator and the district planning offi-
cer, a daylong training session on the survey administration
and research ethics was conducted for the two research assis-
tants on the premises of the district assembly office. Data
gathering at each site was done concurrently between me and
one research assistant to ensure adherence to ethical stan-
dards and sampling techniques. In the data collection site, a
household was randomly selected and an adult aged 18 years
or above was sampled for a face-to-face survey administra-
tion. In Asikuma, household sampling was interlaced with
offices and trading posts, given the administrative function
of the location as the district capital and the major market
hub. That is, some potential respondents for the survey on
this site were mostly likely to be in their offices or trading
sites during the time of administering the survey. The pur-
pose of the survey was explained to each respondent, and
their right to withdraw from the survey (including any infor-
mation divulged) before, during, and after the survey was
made known to them.
Measures
The focus of this study was on the health-seeking behavior
of respondents in a pluralistic health care environment,
modeling self-care or home-care as a health care alterna-
tive. The search for respondents' health-seeking behavior
was not confined to last illness, as a health care option
used for a recent episode of illness may not be a true reflec-
tion of normal health care­seeking behavior. Thus, respon-
dents were asked to identify the predominant form of care
they use in addressing their health care needs, as well as,
the treatment used for last illness. The former allows for an
assessment of the general health care­seeking behavior of
the respondent, whereas the latter assesses recent health
care­seeking behavior, which may or may not be similar to
the general behavior. The dependent variables for this
study were obtained from two prime questions: What is the
preferred or usual choice of treatment for your health care
needs? and What type of care was sought for the last epi-
sode of ailment? Both questions had three response catego-
ries: professional biomedical care, professional indigenous
medical care, and self-care. These responses were created
6 SAGE Open
from an original response list: hospital, clinic, CHP com-
pound, drug store, traditional healer, prayer camp, herbal
clinic, and self-medication. Care sought in hospitals, clin-
ics, and CHP compounds was coded as professional bio-
medical care; care sought from a traditional healer, prayer
camps, and herbal clinics was coded as professional indig-
enous medical care; and care sought by the use of drug
store and self-medication was coded as self-care. The term
professional is attached to biomedical and indigenous care
to distinguish them from the use of biomedical or indige-
nous remedies in a self-care context. Thus, professional
care as used in this study refers to licensed and legally
sanctioned biomedical and indigenous medical care ser-
vices. However, in the case of the latter (indigenous medi-
cal care), the term is loosely applied to embrace
"professional care" provided by faith healers, spiritualists,
and diviners whose activities may or may not be legally
sanctioned. These indigenous professional healers charge
patients for their services either in cash or kind. These
responses represent the conceptualized systems of care in
a pluralistic health care environment.
The choice of independent variables for this study was
informed by an adopted behavioral model of health care
utilization. This model was adopted due to its acknowl-
edgment of geographical (spatial setting), socioeconomic,
and health policy dynamics (such as the distribution of
health resources, health insurance, and cost of services) as
vital factors that determine the use of health care services.
Thus, basic sociodemographic characteristics, place of
residency, perception on distance to nearest professional
care facilities, as well as respondents' perceptions of their
economic status, and the relative cost of professional care,
were used as independent variables. Sociodemographic
variables such as age, sex, highest level of education, and
relationship status were selected as independent variables
for statistical analysis. Economic indicators such as the
type of employment and perceived economic status were
also used as independent variables. The question on type
of employment had two categories: formal sector and
informal sector. Similarly, respondents' perception of
their economic status had two categories: okay and not
okay. Respondents were asked about their NHIS status
and they were to choose either yes (for registered mem-
ber) or no (for nonregistered member). Respondents were
also asked about their perception of which professional
care was relatively costly based on their personal experi-
ence or that of a close social relation: professional bio-
medical care and professional indigenous care. Whereas
respondents were not asked for their place of residence,
the questionnaires distributed in each sampled data site
were coded as Asikuma = 001, Bedum = 002, and Fosuansa
= 002. The coding 001 signifies an urban location while
002 signifies a rural location, thus, helping to determine
whether the respondent was an urban or a rural dweller.
Data Analysis
The study used three levels of statistical analysis--descrip-
tive, bivariate, and multivariate--to assess the relationship
between general and last illness care­seeking behaviors, and
relevant independent variables identified above. The data
were analyzed using STATA statistical software (version 13).
A chi-square test of independence was used to determine the
association between the study's dependent variables and
independent variables. The strength of this relationship was
then determined using Cramer's V test. Furthermore, a mul-
tinomial logistic regression model was used to examine the
influence of the selected independent variables on the choice
and the use of professional biomedical care, professional
indigenous medical care, or self-care as general care­seeking
behavior and last illness care­seeking behavior. This analytic
technique was selected for computing because both depen-
dent variables and their responses are categorical with no
inherent order.
The first multivariate logistic test (Model 1) used respon-
dents' general care­seeking behavior as the dependent vari-
able, whereas the second test (Model 2) used the type of
treatment sought for in the last episode of illness as the
dependent variable. The models report the relative risk ratio
(RRR) and the standard error.
Results
A general summary of the study is presented in Table 1. A sig-
nificant proportion of the study's respondents were female
rural residents aged between 18 and 50 years (56.8%, 55.1%,
and 66.1%, respectively). In addition, a relatively high propor-
tion of this study's respondents were either married or in a form
of a union and had no formal education or only basic education
(59.0% and 67.0%). Most respondents also indicated being
employed in the informal sector (75.8%) and viewed their eco-
nomic status as being okay (72.7%). In terms of health insur-
ance coverage, a highly significant number (72.7%) of this
study's respondents were registered members of the national
risk-pooling insurance scheme (the NHIS). This nation-wide
health insurance scheme is limited to only hospital or biomedi-
cal based care. Notwithstanding, a sizable proportion of the
respondents still viewed professional biomedical care (i.e., care
sought in established health care facilities) as being costly
(40.5%). However, the majority (59.5%) were of the view that
professional indigenous care is relatively costlier than biomed-
ical-based care. Furthermore, a relatively higher proportion of
respondents surveyed (75.8%) were of the view they were in
close proximity to the nearest professional biomedical care ser-
vices compared with professional indigenous care services
(55.5%). The result for care-seeking behavior of this study's
respondents reveals a sharp contrast between the general health
care behavior and the care-seeking behavior for the last episode
of illness suffered by the respondent. In the case of the former,
a little above half (52.9%) of respondents indicate the use of
Amegbor 7
self-care as the general health care behavior. However, in terms
of the type of care sought for their last illness, most respondents
(61.2%) indicated seeking professional biomedical-based care
either in the hospital, the clinic, or from a CHP compound.
Interestingly, the proportions of respondents using professional
indigenous care as both general care­seeking behavior and last
illness care­seeking behavior were significantly low (4.8% and
18.1%, respectively)
Findings of Bivariate Analysis
In determining the relationship between respondents' health
care­seeking behaviors on one hand and their sociodemo-
graphic, economic, geographic, and health financing and
cost on the other, I compute a series of cross-tabulation tests
(Table 2). These tests set the premise for the multinomial
logistic regression models that follow. A relatively higher
proportion of respondents in urban and rural areas (55.9% in
the urban location and 50.4% in the rural locations) generally
indicate self-care as their general care­seeking behavior as
compared with professional biomedical care and profes-
sional indigenous care. Interestingly, in the two geographical
locations, professional indigenous care as the general care
option is significantly low (1.0% and 8.0% of urban and rural
respondents, respectively). There is a weak statistically sig-
nificant relationship between respondents'place of residence
(urban and rural) and the type of treatment they indicate as
their general care­seeking behavior (p < .05, V = .163). In
addition, a higher proportion of the respondents, who per-
ceived both professional biomedical and indigenous care ser-
vices as being close, indicate self-care as their general
care­seeking behavior (55.2% and 56.3%, respectively).
Respondents in all sociodemographic categories, except
those who have attained secondary education or higher, indi-
cate self-care as their general care­seeking behavior. A
higher proportion of respondents who have attained second-
ary education or higher (50.7%) indicate professional bio-
medical care as their general care­seeking behavior
compared with self-care and professional indigenous care
(45.3% and 4.0%, respectively). None of the variables in the
sociodemographic category had a statistically significant
relationship with general care­seeking behavior.
Similarly, a higher proportion of respondents employed in
the formal sector indicate professional biomedical care
(50.9%) as their general care­seeking behavior compared
with those in the informal sector who indicate self-care
(54.1%). Overall, respondents irrespective of their perceived
economic status indicate self-care as their general care­seek-
ing behavior. Both economic variables did not have a statisti-
cally significant relationship with general care­seeking
behavior. Membership in the NHIS and perception of the
cost of professional care on one hand, and general health­
seeking behavior on the other had statistically significant
relationships (p < .05). A little above half (50.3%) of the
respondents who are registered and active members of the
NHIS indicate professional biomedical care as their general
care­seeking behavior. Interestingly, respondents who indi-
cate professional biomedical care and professional indige-
nous care as being costly indicate self-care as their general
care­seeking behavior (51.1% and 54.1%, respectively). The

test of the strength of an association indicates that there is a
strong level of association between NHIS membership and
general care­seeking behavior (V = .350), whereas that
between respondents' perception of the cost of professional
care­ and general care­seeking behavior is weak (V = .191).
In general, the percent of respondents who indicate the use
professional indigenous care as their general care­seeking
behavior is significantly small, ranging between 1.0% and
14.5% (in all independent variables)
Across-tabulation computation between respondents'last ill-
ness care­seeking behavior and the independent variables shows
that, in all categories, a higher proportion of respondents used
professional biomedical care. Nevertheless, a chi-square test of
association reveals only perceived proximity to nearest profes-
sional biomedical care service, age, and sex had statistically sig-
nificant relationships with last illness care­seeking behavior.
Both proximity to nearest professional biomedical care and sex
had a weak statistically significant association with respondents'
lastillnesscare­seekingbehavior(V=.163andV=.183,respec-
tively; p < .05). Age as an independent variable had a moderate
statistically significant relationship with the type of care sought
for last illness (p < .05, V = .253). In contrast to general care­
seeking behavior, the use of professional traditional care varies
across all the responses for the independent variables (Table 2).

Findings of Multinomial Regression Models
Two models were built to assess the relationship between
respondents' socioeconomic, geographical, and health care
cost and financing characteristics on one hand, and their
health care­seeking behaviors on the other. As stated previ-
ously, the results of the cross-tabulation test informed these
multinomial regression models. The two models (Table 3)
strengthen the bivariate cross-tabulation findings in predict-
ing the health care­seeking behaviors of respondents in dif-
ferent socioeconomic, geographic, and health care cost and
financing. The interpretations of the RRR for the multino-
mial logistic regression models are in reference to the base
outcome of using or selecting self-care as the general and last
illness care­seeking behavior. The first model (Model 1)
examines the relationship between general care­seeking
behavior and the socioeconomic, geographical, and national
policy characteristics. In Model 1, NHIS members as com-
pared with nonmembers were three times more likely to
select professional biomedical care as general care­seeking
behavior rather than self-care (RRR = 3.336, p < .01), con-
trolling for all other factors. In addition, urban residents as
compared with their rural counterparts were less likely to
select professional indigenous care as their general care­
seeking behavior (RRR = 0.079, p < .1). Residents who were
of the opinion professional biomedical care was relatively
expensive compared with professional indigenous care were
nearly six times more likely to indicate professional indige-
nous care as their general care­seeking behavior rather than
self-care (RRR = 5.844, p < .05), controlling for all other
factors. Overall, the model was statistically significant and
the predictor variables used in the model accounts for 25% of
the variance in the general care­seeking behavior.
Model 2 examines the relationship between the type of
treatment sought for last illness (last illness care­seeking
behavior), and socioeconomic, geographic, and health care
and financing characteristics. The results of the test show
that residents who perceive professional biomedical care
being close, as compared with those who view it as far, are
nearly three times more likely to have used professional bio-
medical care rather than self-care for the last illness they
experienced prior to the study (RRR = 2.776, p < .05). In
addition, residents aged 18 to 50 years (compared with those
aged 51 years and above) are five times more likely to have
used professional biomedical care rather than self-care for
the last illness experienced (RRR = 5.146, p < .01). Males
compared with females are almost 63% less likely to have
used professional biomedical care rather than self-care for
the last illness experienced prior to the study (RRR = 0.369,
p < .05). However, individuals in a relationship as compared
with those not in a relationship are twice more likely to have
used professional biomedical care rather than self-care in
treating the last illness they experienced prior to this study
(RRR = 2.022, p < .1). People who perceive their economic
status as okay compared with those who viewed their status
as not okay were 76% less likely to have used professional
biomedical care rather than self-care for the last illness suf-
fered before the study (RRR = 0.235, p < .01). Comparing
the use of professional indigenous care to self-care, males in
relation to females were almost 70% less likely to have used
the former care option (RRR = 0.281, p < .01)
Discussion
The goal of this study was to examine health-seeking behav-
ior of residents in Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of
Ghana from the context of a pluralistic health care system.
Generally, the findings of this study demonstrate that the
general care­seeking behavior of residents in the study dis-
trict contradicts their treatment-seeking behavior for the last
illness they experienced prior to this study. Whereas resi-
dents usually tend to self-medicate, most of the residents
sought care from a professional biomedical care center for
their last illness. The difference in general health­seeking
behavior and the type of treatment sought for last illness can
be understood from both health and socioeconomic perspec-
tives. In the case of the former, numerous studies in Ghana
indicate that patients mainly delay in seeking treatment from
professional healers for their bad health (Ahorlu, Koram,
Ahorlu, De Savigny, & Weiss, 2006; Asenso-Okyere et al.,
1998; Getahun, Deribe, & Deribew, 2010). Patients tend to
self-care for illness they perceive less chronic; remedies used
in the self-care context include both biomedical drugs and
traditional herbal medicine. For instance, numerous studies
on malaria care­seeking behavior in Ghana indicate that the
poor and vulnerable usually delay in seeking treatment for
this prevalent disease (Ahorlu et al., 2006; Amexo, Tolhurst,
Barnish, & Bates, 2004; Tolhurst & Nyonator, 2006). The
delay in seeking professional care results in high mortality
cases attributed to the disease (Dzator & Asafu-Adjaye,
2004; McCombie, 2002). Whereas access to biomedical care
and patient's perception on the severity are noted as contrib-
uting to delay in seeking treatment, cost of care and inability
to pay for professional health care are the major reasons for
patients' delay in seeking professional care (Asenso-Okyere
& Dzator, 1997; Kolling, Winkley, & von Deden, 2010;
Russell, 1996).
The influence of economic and financial factors on resi-
dents' care­seeking behavior is evident from the findings of
this study. Cross-tabulation computation of the study vari-
ables shows that residents with secondary education or higher,
employed in the formal sector, and active members of the
NHIS tend to use professional biomedical care as their gen-
eral care seeking option (50.7%, 50.9%, and 50.3%, respec-
tively). The inability of the poor and marginally poor to pay
for treatment contributes to their delay in seeking cure for
acute health conditions, hence the use of self-medication
(Ahorlu et al., 2006; Ansah et al., 2009; Carrillo et al., 2011).
The decision to seek professional care is made when the dis-
ease or illness deteriorates (Ansah et al., 2009; Kiwuwa,
10 SAGE Open
Charles, & Harriet, 2005; Mugisha, Kouyate, Gbangou, &
Sauerborn, 2002) and, even in such situation, they usually
borrow money or pawn their goods to pay for care (Aikins,
2005; Amexo et al., 2004; Asenso-Okyere & Dzator, 1997).
In addition, the findings of these studies such as many others
reveal that policy interventions in the biomedical health care
system such as the NHIS has improved access and use of
professional care in this sector of Ghana's health system
(Blanchet, Fink, & Osei-Akoto, 2012; Fenny et al., 2015;
Tawiah et al., 2016). Notwithstanding, registered members of
the NHIS still face fiscal burden in their use of biomedical
services. The heavy financial burden on registered members
mainly emanates from payment for prescribed drugs
(Dalinjong & Laar, 2012; Witter & Garshong, 2009). Whereas

physician consultation may be free or less expensive for
members under the scheme, the drug coverage of the scheme
is highly inadequate (Dalinjong & Laar, 2012). Existing stud-
ies on Ghana's NHIS as well as other's in the subregion indi-
cate that registered members complain about the need to pay
for most of their prescription drugs (Abdou Illou, Haddad,
Agier, & Ridde, 2015; Beogo, Huang, Drabo, & Yé, 2016).
This contributes to the significant number (48.5%) of regis-
tered members who selected self-care as their general care
behavior. In view of such challenges, it is acknowledged that
it is difficult to isolate health insurance as the key factor influ-
encing the use of biomedical services (Fenny et al., 2015).
Although the indigenous health care system is becoming
increasingly commercialized, currently there is no existing
policy that relieves its users of the financial burden they face.
The NHIS does not cover indigenous medical care; hence,
patients using this professional system of care pay directly
out of pocket (Barimah, 2013; Sato, 2012a). This heavy
financial burden may have contributed to the lower propor-
tions of respondents who indicate its use as a general care­
seeking behavior and as care sought for last illness (Table 2).
Likewise, the financial burden of using professional indige-
nous medical care may account for the low RRR of residents
in an urban settlement, indicating this treatment option as
their general care­seeking option compared with self-care
(RRR = 0.079, p < .1). It is generally recognized that the cost
of treatment in urban areas tends to be higher than rural areas
(Romay-Barja et al., 2015). In addition, professional indige-
nous healers in the rural areas may be less commercially ori-
ented due to high levels of close social relations among rural
residents compared with the anonymity of urban life
(Bierlich, 1999; Muela et al., 2000; Stromberg, 1975). In
view of the heavy financial burdens Ghanaians face using the
professional indigenous health care sector, some researchers
advocate for the need to include traditional healers (espe-
cially licensed or registered healers) as service providers in
the country's NHIS (Barimah, 2013). The commodification
of some aspects of the indigenous health care system through
professionalization of healers (licensing) and regulations has
saddled patients and nonpatients with the financial burden
that once inhibited a large number of Ghanaians from using
biomedical care (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998;Asenso-Okyere
& Dzator, 1997; Dzator & Asafu-Adjaye, 2004; Nyonator &
Kutzin, 1999).
Whereas self-care or self-medication remains a popular
treatment-seeking avenue for general care behavior, the use
of professional biomedical care for severe or chronic, as well
as, other acute illness remains popular among residents in the
study district. This finding challenges long-held assertion
that biomedical care remains highly unpopular among
Ghanaians and people in sub-Saharan Africa (Ae-Ngibise
et al., 2010; Good et al., 1979; Leslie, 1980; Tsey, 1997). It is
worth noting that other studies have similarly acknowledged
the popularity of biomedical remedies and therapeutic drugs
among younger people (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998). The
second model (Model 2) of this study confirms this intergen-
erational gap in the use of biomedical care. The relative risk
of the young (18-50 years) seeking professional biomedical
care for their last illness as compared with self-care is more
likely by a factor of 5.146 (p < .01), all else being equal
(Table 3). There is the gendered aspect in the use of profes-
sional biomedical care, as males are less likely than females
(RRR = 0.369, p < .05) to have sought professional biomedi-
cal care rather than use self-care for the last illness experi-
enced prior to this study. Likewise, males are less likely to
have sought professional indigenous care for the last illness
they experienced before this study (RRR = 0.281, p < .01).
Studies by de-Graft Aikins and Sato demonstrate the prefer-
ence for biomedical care in the initial stages of professional
care (Aikins, 2005; Sato, 2012b). For instance, in the case of
the latter's study, the use of indigenous medicine was rela-
tively low at the first recourse of treatment, while it doubles
or triples in the second stage (Sato, 2012b). Thus, profes-
sional biomedical care, contrary to popular belief, is widely
accepted by Ghanaians. However, patients often seek profes-
sional indigenous care for diseases and illness that could not
be treated with biomedicine (Aikins, 2002, 2005; Aikins
et al., 2010; Sato, 2012b).
In addition, the changing socioeconomic structure of
Ghana influences the use of biomedicine and indigenous
medicine. In his study on the role of socioeconomic status on
the use of biomedicine and indigenous medicine, Sato
(2012a) notes that rising income is associated with the
increasing use of the former and the decreasing use of the
latter (indigenous medicine). From the study's model, the
relative risk of using professional biomedical for the last ill-
ness experienced by residents who perceive their economic
status as okay compared with the poor, is less likely by a
factor 0.235 (p < .01), all else being equal. This finding is
counterintuitive to Sato's assertion. However, factors such as
time spent seeking for care and existing social security pro-
gram for the poor may explain the difference. Individuals
who are economically active are less likely to trade off their
economic activity for professional care in acute health condi-
tions (Buor, 2004). In addition, the NHIS provides exemp-
tions for individuals without adequate financial resources to
pay the premium (Aryeetey et al., 2013; Durairaj et al.,
2010a; Jehu-Appiah et al., 2011). Although this strict income
norm of exemption excludes the marginally poor, existing
social intervention programs by international and local civil
society organizations such as International Labour
Organisation (ILO) and local nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs) have helped this category of Ghanaians to pay
for the NHIS premium (Durairaj, D'Almeida, & Kirigia,
2010a, 2010b). These financial interventions may account
for the relatively high use of professional biomedical care by
the residents in the study who perceived their economic sta-
tus as poor.
The effect of distance on patients' treatment-seeking

research. Distance as a barrier to access and use of health
care services is not only confined to physical proximity but
also pertains to the ability to overcome the cost of travel in
getting to treatment location (Buor, 2003; Rosenberg, 1983;
Yantzi & Rosenberg, 2008). Studies on Ghana's biomedical
health care system increasingly point to the influence that
distance to care facilities and cost of travel exert on the poor
and rural dwellers in their access biomedical care (Jørgensen,
2008; Kissah-Korsah, 2008). These studies acknowledge
that patients especially the poor and vulnerable prefer to
travel shorter distances for care (Aikins & Marks, 2007;
Leonard, 2003). It is generally asserted that longer distance
and cost of travel to biomedical care facilities promote pref-
erence for indigenous medicine (de Wet & Ngubane, 2014;
Gyasi, Mensah, Adjei, & Agyemang, 2011). The findings of
this study similarly indicate that residents' perception on the
proximity of the nearest biomedical care facility influences
the type of care sought for last illness experienced prior to
this study. Residents who opined that biomedical services
were close were more than twice likely to have sought pro-
fessional biomedical care rather than self-care for the last ill-
ness they experienced compared with those who viewed such
services as far (RRR = 2.776, p < .05). Whereas the influence
of distance on access and use of biomedical care is widely
recognized in studies, its effect on the new professional
indigenous care system is less known. Nevertheless, this
study can infer from Van Andel, Myren, and Van Onselen
(2012) that, distance as a barrier to care has a similar effect
on the use of professional indigenous care services. In their
study on Ghana's herbal market, they found out that products
transported from long distances were quite expensive (Van
Andel et al., 2012). There is the need, therefore, to deeply
and critically examine the effect of distance as geographic
and economic factors on the use of professional indigenous
medical care services given the changes that have character-
ized the indigenous health care system.
This study has few conceptual and methodological limita-
tions which presents avenues for future studies. The first
limitation relates to the conceptual model used in statistical
and analytical discussion. In this present study, respondent's
health need and how it may have influenced their care-seek-
ing behaviors is not captured. Thus, further studies are neces-
sary to explore the influence of self-rated health status, and
existence of chronic illness on last seeking behaviors of
Ghanaians within this pluralistic perspective. In addition,
respondents were not asked the severity of the last illness
experienced prior to the study; hence it is difficult to assert
whether the severity may have contributed to the difference
in care­seeking behavior (general care seeking and last ill-
ness care­seeking behavior). The second limitation concerns
the cross-sectional nature of the study and the small sample
size. The former limits the ability of this study to make causal
relationship among the study variables. However, this limita-
tion is overcome by cross-referencing findings of this study
with others of similar theme or topic. Finally, the number of
total respondents in this quantitative study was not large
enough, hence the response categories of the study variables
were collapsed to into dichotomous responses. This was
done to address the issue of no response or small number of
responses for certain categories.
Conclusion
This study to the best of my knowledge, is the first to investi-
gate the treatment seeking behaviors of Ghanaians in a plural-
istic health system perspective by conceptualizing self-care as
a health care sector in modern Ghanaian health care system.
The study argues for the inclusion of self-care or self-medica-
tion in any pluralistic health system analysis especially in a
Ghanaian and sub-Saharan Africa context, given the transfor-
mations that have occurred in both the biomedical and indig-
enous health care systems. The findings of this study show that
residents in Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of Ghana have
a distinction general care­seeking behavior and last illness
care­seeking behavior. Whereas, majority of the resident tend
to indicate self-care as their general care­seeking behavior, a
significantly high proportion used professional biomedical
services for the last illness they experienced prior to this study.
Self-care as a predominant avenue of treatment in Ghana has
been acknowledged in a number of studies (Asenso-Okyere
et al., 1998; Biritwum, Welbeck, & Barnish, 2000; Dzator &
Asafu-Adjaye, 2004; Sato, 2012b; Waddington & Enyimayew,
1989), though not from a pluralistic health systems perspec-
tive as done in this study.
The study further reveals that policy and planning interven-
tions in the biomedical health care system has improved access
and use of its services in the study area. The NHIS for example
was seen to have influence on the general care­seeking behav-
ior of residents, as members tend to use biomedical care ser-
vices due to the financial cushion the scheme provides in access
to services. Similarly, location of CHPs health center in
deprived areas has also boost access and use of biomedical care
services compared with self-care and professional indigenous
care in terms of the type of treatment residents sought for their
last illness. The study further demonstrates that the commer-
cialization and professionalization of the indigenous health
care system has significantly introduced economic burdens in it
access and use, especially among the poor and urban dwellers.
In view of this study opens a pathway for the need critically
re-examine Ghana's indigenous medical care system and how
contemporary transformations are influencing access to ser-
vices in the professionalized sector. It is my hope that the find-
ings of this study will guide and inform discourse on Ghana's
pluralistic health care systems from a triple sector perspective
rather than the dual system approach advocated by Good et al.
(1979), Twumasi (1979), Sato (2012a) and others.
