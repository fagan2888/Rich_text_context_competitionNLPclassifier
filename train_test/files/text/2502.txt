Abstract
Objective
This administrative data-linkage cohort study examines the association between prison
crowding and the rate of post-release parole violations in a random sample of prisoners
released with parole conditions in California, for an observation period of two years (January
2003 through December 2004).
Background
Crowding overextends prison resources needed to adequately protect inmates and provide
drug rehabilitation services. Violence and lack of access to treatment are known risk factors
for drug use and substance use disorders. These and other psychosocial effects of crowd-
ing may lead to higher rates of recidivism in California parolees.
Methods
Rates of parole violation for parolees exposed to high and medium levels of prison crowding
were compared to parolees with low prison crowding exposure. Hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox model for recurrent events. Our
dataset included 13070 parolees in California, combining individual level parolee data with
aggregate level crowding data for multilevel analysis.
Results
Comparing parolees exposed to high crowding with those exposed to low crowding, the
effect sizes from greatest to least were absconding violations (HR 3.56 95% CI: 3.05­4.17),
drug violations (HR 2.44 95% CI: 2.00­2.98), non-violent violations (HR 2.14 95% CI: 1.73­
2.64), violent and serious violations (HR 1.88 95% CI: 1.45­2.43), and technical violations
(HR 1.86 95% CI: 1.37­2.53).

Conclusions
Prison crowding predicted higher rates of parole violations after release from prison. The
effect was magnitude-dependent and particularly strong for drug charges. Further research
into whether adverse prison experiences, such as crowding, are associated with recidivism
and drug use in particular may be warranted.
Introduction
High incarceration rates in the United States have raised serious public health concerns,
both related to prison experience as an exposure to stress, injury and infectious disease, and
related to imprisonment as a negative outcome of adverse social determinants of health in
the environment [1­5]. Whereas advocates of high incarceration rates cite rational choice
theory to predict that consistent punishment will reduce crime rates, some observers of
disadvantaged communities see the criminal justice measures taken to deter crime as
exacerbating poverty traps that are conducive to high crime rates [6]. Crowding overextends
prison supervision, allowing violence against inmates to go unchecked. It also dilutes access
to drug treatment resources. Trauma and deficient mental health services are both risk fac-
tors for substance use disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Prisons also promote the
acquisition and spread of infectious diseases through crowding, and this is especially true
for drug-related HIV and hepatitis C infections and crowding-related tuberculosis infec-
tions [6, 7]. In California, the contribution of severe crowding to violence and grossly sub-
standard inmate healthcare warranted legal intervention by the federal government; the U.S.
Supreme Court mandated that the state reduce its incarceration rates to redress crowding
problems [8].
This study examines prison crowding as a risk factor for recidivism. Crowding is defined as
occupancy rate, which can be found by dividing the designed maximum capacity into the num-
ber of prisoners housed in an institution, and multiplying this by 100. Records from the Cali-
fornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), from 1991 through 2010, show
the mean rate occupancy across all state institutions was 186.96% [9]. Some prisoners have
spent the entirety of their sentences in converted reception centers operating at an occupancy
rate of over 300% [10]. Furthermore, in the last 30 years California's general prison population
increased 572%, and its parole population grew by 708% [11].
Crowding-related stress is associated with both aggression and impaired executive function
in both children and adults [12, 13, 14]. Short-term crowding has been shown to lead to more
competitive behavior in children and adolescents, particularly for males, in a study examining
cooperative and competitive play after exposure to crowding [15]. In adults, residential crowd-
ing stress has been linked to negative affect, social tension, learned helplessness and behaviors
that are more competitive, reactive, and involved with reestablishing control [16, 17, 18]. The
enforced helplessness characteristic of prison life has been shown to exacerbate crowding-
related behavior problems on several dimensions [16, 17, 18]. This study's hypothesis, that
prison crowding predicts higher rates of recidivism, assumes that after an exposure to crowd-
ing-related stress, an adult's behavior and cognitive coping skills continue to be negatively
affected by that experience, an assumption that has not yet been directly tested but which finds
indirect support in some previous research [13, 15].
This study's outcome variable, recidivism, is associated with chronic socioeconomic and
psychosocial disadvantage in communities affected by high rates of incarceration. California

has some of the highest recidivism rates in the United States, and its unique parole system is a
factor [19]. Almost all prisoners are released on parole, usually for three years, with varying lev-
els of monitoring. Recidivism may take any of three forms: (i) parole violations, (ii) new arrests,
or (iii) parole revocation (termination of parole). Both parole violations and new arrests are
multifactorial and are related to behavioral, socioeconomic, community, and policy-driven
conditions [20]. However, parole revocations are decided by an administrative board and are
the ultimate determinant of whether a parolee returns to prison [19]. Despite this review,
inmates released from California prisons from 2006 to 2007 had an average recidivism rate of
over 65%. In addition, among offenders who had been released two or more times, the rate was
over 75% [21]. Overall, more than 40% of prisoner admissions in 2010 were from parole viola-
tors returning to custody [22].
This study's hypothesis, that prison crowding is associated with higher rates of recidivism,
contradicts the conventional wisdom in the field of criminology. Criminology theories, such as
rational choice theory, argue that individuals make law violation decisions based on their indi-
vidual needs relative to the perceived risk of legal consequences [23]. A crude way of applying
this theory would hold that adverse prison conditions (such as crowding) should increase per-
ceived risk, therefore decreasing the likelihood of individual recidivism. However, a more fine-
grained application of rational choice theory would hold that adverse prison conditions are less
salient to parolees facing an opportunity to reoffend than other considerations, such as the per-
ceived risk of arrest and successful prosecution, and the length of sentences associated with the
violation in question.
In fact, several studies have actually found that harsher prison conditions were positively
associated with recidivism. One of these studies, a study of federal inmates, found that higher
levels of security housing (commensurate with increased restrictions) did not reduce recidivism
[24]. In addition, a survival analysis of California prisoners randomized into different security
level classifications found that the highest level had more than a 30% increased risk of return-
ing to prison compared with the lowest level [25]. Higher security levels often correspond to
longer sentences, an important confounder in this analysis. Such sentences lead to less success-
ful reintegration into society after release, and thus contribute to recidivism. However, these
studies still raise doubts as to whether harsh prison conditions are crime deterrents, and they
support the possibility that crowding could be one factor behind California's high recidivism
rates.
If crowding does increase a prisoner's risk of recidivism, this could be explained by the psy-
chosocial stress associated with adverse prison conditions, which may exacerbate decision-
making problems (e.g., impulsivity) and problem behaviors (e.g., drug use, aggression) in
prison populations. Such a relationship would, necessarily, be mediated by factors overrepre-
sented in prison populations that include mental illness, cognitive dysfunction and intellectual
disability, in addition to factors related to former prisoners' social environment. The high prev-
alence of substance use disorder (SUD) in prison populations may also be a factor in the high
rates of drug-related recidivism seen among California parolees [22].
Relatively little research has been done to date on the relationship between prison crowding
and recidivism. Insufficient statistical methods and the availability of only aggregate level data
hindered early attempts to study the effect of crowding specifically on recidivism [26­27]. One
recent individual-level data study of twenty-five thousand Italian former prisoners found that
prison crowding was directly associated with recidivism [28]. However, these researchers were
unable to measure the effect size with great precision (the upper limit of the confidence interval
for their estimated effect size was 0.064, whereas the lower limit was negative and close to 0).
Additionally, they did not assess what types of violations were more susceptible to an effect on
recidivism.

In one other study of California parolees, investigators found that the more overcrowded a
correctional institution was, the less likely parole boards were to return a violator back to
prison [29]. Their analysis, however, did not consider crowding as a risk factor for parolees to
actually violate parole. It is also unknown how these parole board decisions may have ulti-
mately altered recidivism rates for specific parole violation types.
Study purpose and rationale
Crowding overextends prison resources, to the detriment of prisoner safety and public health
[6]. Running prisons over capacity makes adequate inmate behavior monitoring nearly impos-
sible, leading to increased violence and rape [30­38]. Additionally, overcrowded prisons can-
not offer adequate drug treatment or any other medical care [39­41]. Limited access to drug
treatment may contribute to higher rates of drug use-related recidivism among parolees with
SUD. For example, CDCR inmates who did not take part in drug treatment during and after
prison had double the recidivism rates of those who did [22]. This study investigates the poten-
tial for a vicious cycle between high incarceration rates and high crime rates, mediated by
prison crowding levels.
Study question
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether parolees exposed to higher levels of prison
crowding returned to prison at higher rates than others. Consequently, the research question
was as follows: Does prison crowding exposure predict higher rates of parole violations? The
hypothesis of this study is that crowding is associated with higher rates of parole violations.
Psychosocial stress is the hypothesized mediator of the effect of crowding on rates of parole
violations. However, this study's statistical inference is limited to the effect of study exposure
(prison crowding) on the study outcome (rates of parole violations), with no data on subjects'
stress hormone levels (e.g., cortisol) or other clinical measures of stress associated with crowd-
ing-related behavior problems. We can look at effect size differences for different types of
parole violations (e.g., drug-related charges), but because of the high frequency of missing data
on use of drug treatment programs within the study population (26%), and because data on
SUD diagnosis were only available at the aggregate level, we are unable to control for history of
SUD.
Methods
Study population
The study population comprised a random sample of 5% of California's parolees under
the supervision of CDCR between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Event data
were included on 13070 parolees out of the total population of 254468. Rates of parole viola-
tions over this two year observation period were calculated using recurrent events survival
analysis.
Data
Sources. Data were combined from two sources. The first, maintained by the National
Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), contains the individual level data for all variables
except prison crowding level [42]. Survival observations were made weekly to record whether
or not a subject violated parole and which type of violation, if any, occurred. Violation events
were counted whenever a parolee was observed to have violated a technical or Level I to Level
III violation, or absconded. Technical violations include missed appointments with officers,

visiting outside the parole region, and other non-criminal offenses. California is one of a few
states that returns parolees to prison as a sanction for technical violations. Absconding viola-
tions include both cases in which the parolee has left the state's jurisdiction without permission
and those in which he or she has simply failed to report for parole supervision. Level I viola-
tions are predominantly personal drug offenses, such as drug use, drug possession, failure to
register as a drug offender, being under the influence, being drunk in public, etc. Level II viola-
tions include drug sales, property offenses, and other non-injury crimes. Level III violations
consist of serious and violent crimes. Non-violation events were counted whenever a parolee:
(i.) had no violation during an observation, (ii.) was censored, or (iii.) had their parole period
end without violation.
The second source of data comprises monthly adult prison population reports hosted on
CDCR's official website. Population totals were aggregated at the institutional (prison) level.
This study utilized reports for the months of July, 1990, through December, 2002.
Aggregating crowding levels. Monthly CDCR population census reports were digitized,
compiled, and cleaned. Prisons were then grouped according to geographical region, corre-
sponding with CDCR's four parole regions based on map plotting. Region I includes the north-
ern part of the state, not including the coast. Region II includes only the coastal regions of
Northern California. Region III includes only Los Angeles County. Region IV contains both
the coastal and inland areas of Southern California. Weighted averages of prison crowding lev-
els were then calculated for each group of prisons in a parole region over the 150 study months,
resulting in 600 weighted measurements of crowding. These continuous values were subse-
quently grouped into three discrete levels: "low," "medium," and "high." Cut-off levels were
based on maximum capacity recommendations from the United States Government Account-
ability Office and expert testimony [39, 43]. "Low" was defined as less than 190% capacity,
"medium" was defined as between 190% and 205% capacity, and "high" was defined as 205%
or greater. It was impossible to create a group without any crowding since all Californian pri-
sons were over capacity.
Assigning aggregate crowding levels to individual subjects. The crowding exposure level
for each subject was determined by the parole region of the parolees' prison and the crowding
level in that region during the month prior to the date of their release from prison. Occasion-
ally, some prisoners (particularly those with medical conditions) are transferred between insti-
tutions. However, even for these prisoners, the last thirty days represents a significant portion
of total time served (77% of parolees served <5 months during the study) [10]. Release date
was calculated by subtracting a given parolee's days of freedom from the study start date
(rounded to the nearest month).
Data Analysis
Software. All data assembly and analysis were performed using R, an open source, object-
oriented programming language and environment [44]. All time-related data were first made
date attributable using the package Lubridate, making time calculations feasible [45]. A hot-
decking method of data imputation utilizing random recursive partitioning (RRP) for match-
ing was implemented using the RRP library [46]. This is a Monte Carlo procedure which gener-
ates a proximity matrix for nonparametric missing data imputation, classification, prediction
and matching problems [47]. Cox proportional hazard regression models, including stratified
and recurrent models, were run using functions from the Survival package [48].
Some analysis and adjustments to the data were made by the NACJD prior to this research
project, and we cannot describe their work in this paper. The NACJD investigators did have
access to the relevant death file, but could not describe how censoring accounted for mortality

at the time of our research project. We do know that parolees were censored when their parole
period ended without a violation or when the study period ended before they had either vio-
lated or completed parole. We also know that there was left-truncation of the data set (for
example, almost half the observations used in the final model are for parolees who had been on
parole for more than a year before the observation period begins).
Rationale for using recurrent events survival models. The standard Cox proportional
hazards model is a nonparametric type of survival analysis that allows for adjusted calcula-
tions of hazard ratios without needing to express a baseline hazard. However, upon release
parolees could have accumulated several parole violations before being returned to prison.
Therefore, it was necessary to use a survival analysis model that could accommodate recur-
rent events within a subject. There are several approaches to recurrent events survival analy-
sis that have been shown to be superior to the standard Cox proportional hazards model
[49]. This may be accomplished by using a counting process approach, which considers sep-
arate event observations of the same subject as though they were from different subjects
using start and stop times for interval truncation [50]. Thus our data for time until parole
violation was converted into counting process format (stop/start times) for use in Cox pro-
portional hazards models modified to account for recurrent events with discontinuous event
times (time in prison was excluded from time at risk). It should be noted that because this
cohort study used recurrent events survival analysis, we measured rates of parole violations
rather than time until parole violations, unlike a conventional Cox proportional hazards
model.
Adjusting variance for within-subject correlation. Robust estimation was used to adjust
the variance of all model coefficients to account for within-subject correlation, using a sand-
wich method similar to that introduced by Lin and Wei [51]. Frailty methods are considered
more effective than counting process models with robust error variance estimation at capturing
heterogeneity when some subjects are believed to be more prone to accumulating events than
others, notably reducing the risk of underestimating effect sizes, but where there is no strong
biological relationship between first events and subsequent events, the methods are comparable
and in some cases, their results are very similar [50, 52]. Because this technique involves adjust-
ing only the estimated variances and not the regression coefficients for the misspecification of
the correlation structure assumed (i.e., the non-independence of recurrent events), the hypoth-
esis test using this method involves evaluating the confidence intervals for effect sizes, rather
than the effect sizes themselves [51].
Evaluating the proportional hazards assumption. All variables were tested to determine
whether the hazard ratios for any two variables in a model were constant. These assumptions
were tested using a graphical approach. Specifically, log-log Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted.
They satisfied the assumption if the curves were subjectively parallel.
Stratified Cox procedure. The models produced in this study included variables that both
did and did not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption. That is, the hazard ratios for
some variables were not constant over time. A Cox stratified procedure was used to control for
both types of variables. This involves stratifying the data by a categorical variable that violates
the proportional hazards assumption [53]. One disadvantage of this method is that it does not
show how the hazard ratios vary over time.
Missing data. Missing data on parole region (hence, exposure to prison crowding), time
under observation (days since release), and several of the covariates were imputed only for vio-
lation events and censored observations. (Data on non-violation observation weeks are not
used in the Cox proportional hazards model). Missing data were less extensive for these events
than for the dataset as a whole; the total percentage of imputed values was 11.5% and the high-
est number of imputed values for a given event was three. The reasons for missing data are

unknown and may, therefore, be non-random. A random recursive partitioning (RRP) method
for non-parametric matching was used; this is a Monte Carlo procedure which generates a
proximity matrix using regression trees for missing data imputation. The algorithm used 250
replications of the procedure, with continuous variables divided into 14 intervals [47]. Missing
data were then imputed using a hot-decking method, that is, one that matches persons with
missing data to persons with similar data on all other covariates and gives the corresponding
value for the missing data [47].
Baseline characteristics
This study's target population was predominantly male. Parolee demographics were 30.7%
white (non-Latino) and 26.1% Black, despite the fact that there are six times as many non-
Latino white people living in the state compared to non-Latino Blacks [54]. The categorical
data on race was transformed into a dichotomous variable for the analysis (either Black or
non-Black). Approximately 80% of the parolees were between 18 and 44 years of age. About
66% reported having a substance use disorder and over half reported having a comorbid men-
tal health condition [55]. Only aggregate level data were available on substance use disorder,
however the final adjusted model does include mental health conditions as a controlled
confounder.
The type of offense for which subjects were on parole (not to be confused with the type of
parole violation) was handled as a categorical variable, with drug offense as the reference value,
as this was the largest category. For race and parole officer race, the reference category was
non-Black, and for sex and parole officer sex, the reference category was female. Three striker
status refers to a "three strikes law" requiring harsher sentences for those with a second or third
serious offense, and in this data set parolees are designated "strikers" if this was their second or
third serious offense. Serious offenses are distinguished from crimes such as personal drug use
or tax evasion that are unlawful, but do not endanger others. Mental illness status was ascer-
tained from official documentation on parolees, which may in some cases have been incom-
plete. Parole supervision levels were defined as follows: (1) Minimum service level,
communicating with the parole agent primarily through the mail (no drug testing), (2) Con-
trolled service level, a moderate level of supervision that may include services for drug use,
mental health problems, education or employment deficits, (3) High control level, where the
emphasis in supervision is on detecting or preventing serious criminal activity, (4) High ser-
vices level, in which high levels of supervision are focused on the service needs of the parolee,
and (5) High risk spec/non-spec, in which the parolee is supervised by a parole agent whose
caseload is composed entirely of high risk parolees who require a high level of supervision.
The baseline event characteristics are described in Table 1, broken down by crowding expo-
sure level. Chi square statistics were calculated for differences across crowding levels, and
Table 1 presents the p-values and degrees of freedom for these statistics. Because these are data
on parole violation or non-violation events (not persons), they represent a summation of the
most recent data for parolee characteristics with respect to each event for each person (for
those variables that may change between events).
Significant differences in exposure to prison crowding were found in most variable groups.
These groups included general demographic differences, offense type, parole region, supervi-
sion level, and age at first incarceration. Black parolees were more likely than non-Black parol-
ees to have been in a prison with low crowding levels. Mentally ill parolees were more likely to
have been in a prison with high crowding levels. Parolees imprisoned for violent crimes were
less likely to have been in a prison with high crowding levels, while the opposite was true for
those imprisoned for property crimes. Parolees at supervision level 1 were more likely to have

been in a prison with low crowding levels, while those at level 4 were more likely to have been
in a prison with medium or high crowding levels. Those who had been imprisoned four or
more times before were more likely to experience higher levels of prison crowding than those
imprisoned for the first time. Only the variable parole region differed dramatically between
crowding levels. Specifically, there were no prisons in either parole regions one or two that
experienced high levels of crowding. In region four, no prisons experienced low levels of
crowding.
Adjustment for confounding. Hazard ratios were adjusted for confounding variables and
for variables that increased precision. Socioeconomic factors were also considered in our analy-
sis, but were not significant confounders; these variables also had a disproportionately higher
frequency of missing values (>40%). No interaction effects were found between the variables.
Left-truncation of the dataset was accounted for by controlling for age at first incarceration. A
Cox stratified procedure (described above) was used to control for those variables that violated
the proportional hazards assumption and those that did not. Controlled variables that satisfied
the proportional hazards assumption were sex, race, mental health status, prior offense type,
level of supervision, three-striker status, parole officer sex, and parole officer race. Controlled
variables that did not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption were sex offender status,
parole region, age at first incarceration, age at release, number of prior imprisonments, and
number of prior serious offenses leading to imprisonment.
Ethics Statement
All individual level data received anonymous identifiers and were encrypted for storage when
not in use. The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data reviewed and approved the study
protocol and data protection plan. Additionally, the study was reviewed and exempted by the
Touro University-California Institutional Review Board (IRB) because only non-identifiable
data on human subjects were used.
Results
This study period included 21 862 events that were either classified as violation or non-viola-
tion events. The vast majority of the sample, approximately 98%, was observed for a period of
104 to 106 weeks. During the observation period, 8792 parole violations were observed, includ-
ing technical, criminal, and absconding violations. There were no missing violation values. In
unadjusted analysis, parolees had fewer parole violations if they had been imprisoned at high
crowding levels for combined parole violation types, but they were more likely to have
absconded if they were imprisoned at medium crowding levels.

Parole Violations
After adjustment for confounding, prison crowding was associated with higher rates of parole
violations in a magnitude-dependent manner. Specific types of violations had different effect
sizes. From largest to smallest, they were absconding, Type I, Type II, Type III, and technical
violations.
Crude and partially adjusted results
Overall, without any adjustments, the proportion of violations among low, medium, and high
crowding levels was relatively similar (41%, 41%, 33%, respectively). Partially adjusted Kaplan-
Meier curves for all violation types diverged over the 50-month period, most immediately after
release, and the effects were positively proportional to crowding level. The largest effects were
seen for combined, absconding, and Type I violations (Fig 1).
Fig 1A shows that by the end of the study period, fewer than 20% of parolees from high
crowding prisons remained without parole violations, whereas close to 40% of those from mod-
erately crowded prisons, and even more from prisons with low levels of crowding, remained
without parole violations. For both combined violations and absconding violations, that is, Fig
1A and 1B, the differences between crowding levels are dramatic within the first 500 days of
parole. For level one violations, shown in Fig 1C, close to 80% of parolees remained without a
violation at all crowding levels, but the curves do still diverge significantly, with higher rates of
parole violations for parolees who had been imprisoned at higher crowding levels.
Adjusted results for any violation type
After all adjustments, rates of parole violations were 2.28­2.77 times greater for parolees from
highly crowded prisons compared to those from prisons with low levels of crowding (HR 2.52,
95% CI: 2.28­2.77). The effect size was 1.52­1.72 times greater when comparing medium
crowding prisons with low crowding prisons (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.52­1.72). The full model is
presented in Table 2. Hazard ratios for controlled confounders are also reported because these
provide, in a very limited fashion, indirect information about the relative importance of some
uncontrolled confounders (e.g., surveillance bias, socioeconomic status, history of SUD).
Adjusted results for specific violation types
Crowding level-dependent effects were found for each parole violation type (Table 2). The larg-
est effects of high vs. low crowding were found for absconding violations (HR 3.56, 95% CI:
3.05­4.17) and Type I criminal violations (HR 2.44, 95% CI: 2.00­2.98). Other violation types
--Type II criminal violations (HR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.73­2.64), Type III violations (HR 1.88, 95%
CI: 1.45­2.43), and technical violations (HR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.37­2.53)--followed a similar pat-
tern. Effect sizes for medium crowding compared to low crowding were proportionally smaller,
and this data is also presented in Table 2.
Several of the confounders included in the model are shown in Table 2, including sex, race,
history of mental illness, three striker status, level of supervision, offense type, and parole offi-
cer race and sex. Male sex and Black race were both associated with higher rates of parole viola-
tions, as was a history of mental illness. Parolees with three striker status had lower rates of
parole violations than others (HR0.82, 95% CI: 0.75­0.88). Parole officer race, sex, and supervi-
sion level were also significantly associated with rates of parole violation, but as with the other
confounders, all these effect sizes were comparatively small. Parolees who had been imprisoned
for violent crimes had lower rates of combined parole violations than those who had been
imprisoned for drug crimes (HR0.80, 95% CI: 0.74­0.86), whereas those who had been

imprisoned for property crimes had higher rates of parole violations (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.13­
1.27). The latter association was particularly strong for Type II parole violations (HR 5.78, 95%
CI 4.77­7.01), which include property crimes. Parolees who had been imprisoned for violent
crimes were, however, more likely to have committed a Type II or Type III parole violation
than those who had been imprisoned for drug crimes.
Discussion
This study asked whether prison crowding is associated with higher rates of parole violations.
Rates of parole violations were found to be directly associated with prison crowding levels, par-
ticularly for absconding violations and drug charges. The cause of parolee absconding is not
always known. An indirect relationship with drug use is supported by some previous research
[56, 57]. Other reasons for absconding could include seeking instrumental support from family

Summary of stratified recurrent events Cox regression analysis for prison crowding and other covariates predicting parole violation rates.
* Results for prison crowding (and for other predictors of recidivism) were adjusted for: sex, race, mental health status, prior offense type, parole region,
age first incarcerated, age when released, number of prior imprisonments, number of prior serious offenses, sex offender status, level of supervision,
three-striker status, parole officer sex, and parole officer race. A Cox stratified procedure was used to adjust for covariates not meeting the proportional
hazards assumption as well as those that did meet this assumption. These variables are sex offender status, parole region, age first incarcerated, age
when released, number of prior imprisonments, and number of prior serious offenses.

and friends outside the parole region, or difficulty meeting parole conditions such as finding
and maintaining local employment. After absconding, the second largest effect was seen in
Type I criminal violations, which are considered to be the least serious and are almost entirely
drug-related.
Substance use disorder (SUD), which is overrepresented in prison populations, may be
inadequately treated in crowded prisons, increasing the risk of drug-related recidivism for this
subgroup of parolees. Almost a third of recidivists return due to drug offenses [58]. In this
respect, SUD-related violations represent a major vulnerability within the parole system. For
instance, in Ohio and Texas, former prisoners with SUD are three times more likely to return
to prison one year after release [59]. Others have found that parolees with SUDs that are
comorbid with other psychiatric conditions have a significantly higher likelihood of returning
to prison within one year after release [60­61]. Nationally, 42.8% of individuals with SUDs also
have had a comorbid psychiatric disorder [62].
Smaller magnitude-dependent effects were also seen for Types II and III violations. Type II
violations include moderately serious drug offenses, such as sales and trafficking, but they also
include property offenses, consensual sex offenses, and other non-violent offenses. Type III
violations are serious violent and sexual offenses. The association with Type III violations was
large enough to warrant further research on the impact crowding might have on public safety
(e.g., rape, homicide, burglary, child abuse). This finding is consistent with research that
reports that crowding induced violence against inmates is brutalizing in nature and may have
an unintended violent criminogenic effect [63]. The smallest effect size was seen with technical
violations. Such events are not normally associated with criminal sanctions, and they include
behaviors such as missing appointments, traveling outside a parole boundary, accessing legal
weapons, and other non-criminal parole conditions.
The relationship between prison crowding and recidivism may be mediated by stress hor-
mones such as cortisol, which is associated with impaired executive function in children
exposed to crowding-related stress [13]. An impairment in executive function has also been
shown in parents exposed to residential crowding, and in patients with post-traumatic stress
disorder [14, 64]. Alternatively, executive function may also be impaired from drug use in
those with active SUD, who may have limited access to drug treatment in more crowded pri-
sons. However, the literature on adverse effects of prison crowding on inmate health and
behavior is sparse, and the literature on crowding, executive function and aggression is most
extensive for studies on childhood behavior and development [65]. Only studies on children
show adverse effects from crowding that are measureable after research subjects have been
exposed to the crowded environment, as opposed to within crowded conditions [13, 15].
Strong claims about cause and effect are impossible without further research, particularly on
the mediating roles of cognition, social environment and coping skills.
The relationship between prison crowding and recidivism may also be mediated by infec-
tious, chronic and non-substance related psychiatric conditions that contribute to incarcera-
tion. Crowding has been repeatedly linked to high blood pressure levels in prison populations,
the prison prevalence of infectious diseases is substantially higher than the national average,
and upon release from prison, parolees have decreased access to care [65, 6, 66, 67]. The strain,
monetary and otherwise, of an added disease burden related to exposure to prison crowding
could lead to an increased parole violation rate. Due to limitations in available data, informa-
tion about individual parolees' physical health conditions was not available. However, informa-
tion pertaining to mental health conditions was available. The results indicate that parolees
with this designation had higher rates of parole violations (of all types) than those without a
mental health designation (HR 1.46 95%, CI: 1.38­1.55). As previously discussed, there may be
an interaction in parolees with co-occurring disorders.
Prison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism

The potential for an effect of increased recidivism risk for parolees with chronic conditions
is still possible. However, past research has shown only a very weak correlation between parol-
ees with chronic physical conditions and a greater risk for recidivism [68]. These parolees tend
to be older, and age is a known confounder for recidivism. Further research is needed among
this older population.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, weighted averages for crowding measures were aggre-
gated at the level of parole region for each observation point. The potential of an ecological fal-
lacy bias arises for this reason, although it has been mitigated by hybridizing individual-level
data into multi-level models [69]. For example, if residency in Los Angeles County or Southern
California carries additional risk factors for higher rates of parole violations, aggregating
crowding data by region would introduce important confounders to the model. Hybrid multi-
level modeling mitigates this problem by nesting individual-level data with ecological variables,
so that, in this case, risk factors for parole violation that vary by region (e.g., supervision level,
race) were captured at the individual level. Any number of missing variables may act as ecologi-
cal confounders, such as regional variation in levels of access to SUD treatment outside the
prison system, or regional variation in the intensity of the drug trade.
Second, more than 15% of the values were missing for the following variables: age at release
(15.6%), parole region (15.6%), days since release (20.5%), and supervision level (35%). The
reasons for missing data are unknown and may, therefore, be non-random. A random recur-
sive partitioning method (described in the methods section) for missing data imputation was
used to help lessen potential bias. Only data on violation events were imputed, and it should be
noted that the vast majority of missing data on parole region, age at release and days since
release was for non-violation observations that were not censored. Because there were much
higher rates of missing data for censored events on supervision level, parole officer race and
parole officer sex for observation week 105 only (the final observation week in the data set), the
imputation was done using data through week 104 only.
Third, we do not know how the data set was censored before it was made available to us.
Overall, the data was left-truncated and right-censored, but we do not have a description of
how mortality was handled in the censoring. This is an important limitation to our paper, as
we are unable to report tests on informative censoring that would shed light on a potential
source of bias in our analysis.
It is possible that crowding does not significantly increase the risk of recidivism among Cali-
fornia parolees. Risk factors outside of the criminal justice system (e.g., poverty, child abuse
history, employment status, familial integrity) could potentially overshadow the effect of
crowding; if they vary by region within the state of California, they represent important
unmeasured confounders with crowding in this ecological analysis. The influence of social
determinants of health (e.g., poverty, county discipline, public assistance) on rates of recidivism
could not be included in our analysis because the percentage of missing values was too high
(>40%) for the data to be imputed. Information on race was limited to a dichotomous variable
(Black or non-Black). Important confounders with the demographic variables race, age and
disability (mental illness), such as socioeconomic status and education level, could not be
included in the model because of the missing data, making the interpretation of the results for
demographic variables somewhat ambiguous. Low socioeconomic status, limited access to pub-
lic assistance, low education levels and an adverse social environment are all risk factors for
both SUD and incarceration that may be overrepresented in regions with higher rates of prison
crowding.

Surveillance bias or differences across regions in quantitative enforcement activity targets
may also have biased the results. Quotas and other similar police management tools have been
shown to strongly predict arrest rates even where measures have been taken to preserve officer
discretion and prevent arbitrary arrests [70]. Many parole agents attest that parole violations
are highly subjective, that is, that "a parole agent can always find a violation for a parolee if he
or she wants to" [20]. Surveillance bias could also explain why all types of parole violations,
including technical violations, were directly associated with prison crowding.
Unfortunately, history of SUD was only measured at the aggregate level in this data set, and
access to drug treatment in prison was not measured at all. If prison crowding prevents some
inmates with SUD from receiving adequate drug treatment prior to release, this could be an
important predictor of drug-related parole violations. Our aggregate level data on this prison
population shows that SUD is highly prevalent in this sampling frame, so this represents
another important uncontrolled confounder in our analysis--we do not have data on whether
or not SUD prevalence varies by region among California parolees.
Most of the parolees in this study had just served less than five months in prison, making
the control variables for prior history of imprisonment important covariates in our model. The
adjusted analysis controlled for age at first incarceration, number of prior offenses leading to
imprisonment ("number of returns to prison" in Table 1), number of prior serious offenses,
prior offense type and three-striker status. There may, however, be important related con-
founders not included in the model, such as total duration of time in prison inclusive of all
prior offenses.
Finally, the Cox proportional hazards model assumes that observations among individuals
are independent. This study's data involved repeated events within subjects. Although the beta
coefficients in the study models were not adjusted, the variances were adjusted for using an
empirical estimator. These adjustments allowed for comparisons between the hypotheses and
their confidence intervals [51]. However, robust error variance estimation does not capture
heterogeneity among parolees in rates of recidivism; instead, this method considers within-
subject event likelihood correlation to be a nuisance variable. Offense type was an important
confounder in our model, strongly predictive of parole violation type in adjusted analysis. This
does suggest within-subject correlation in propensity to violate parole.
Study Implications
Previous corrections studies have posited that adverse prison conditions act to deter freed pris-
oners from returning to prison. The present findings do not support this deterrent model of
corrections, instead agreeing with other findings [22, 26]. Additional criminal justice
approaches to drug use, such as arrests, have similarly been found to be counterproductive
[71]. Average outpatient drug treatment in the United States costs 14.4 times less, and long-
term residential drug treatment costs 3.8 times less, than incarceration [72]. In 2010, CDCR
reported that the annual cost of incarcerating a single prisoner was $45000 per year. Addition-
ally, states with higher than national average drug treatment rates send approximately 100
fewer people to prison per 100000 than states with below national average drug treatment rates
[73]. Mental health courts are also considered an important means of redressing prison crowd-
ing; a shortage of beds in inpatient psychiatric wards is directly related to the high prevalence
of mental illness in prison populations [74].
The relationship between mass incarceration and crowding-related stress as well as prison
violence and lack of access to SUD care may explain the finding that parolees who experienced
higher levels of prison crowding had higher rates of parole violations, and that this association
was particularly strong for drug-related parole violations. Potential interventions include

measures to redress both prison crowding and negligent SUD and mental health care, such as
the use of mandatory drug treatment referrals as an alternative to incarceration, and increased
use of mental health courts. Further research on the association between prison crowding and
recidivism is warranted.
Future Areas of Research
Adverse prison experiences. Further research on negligent SUD care and prison violence
would be needed to better understand the relationship between prison crowding and both
PTSD and SUD. In addition, data on drug-related parole violations are no substitute for direct
measures of SUD relapse among parolees. Additional research on the relationship between
access to drug treatment in prison and rates of SUD relapse is warranted.
County and city jails. A recent criminal justice reform (known as the Public Safety
Realignment Act), charges counties and municipalities with additional responsibilities, includ-
ing; supervision of most state parolees and incarceration of most newly convicted persons, as
well as parole violators [75]. Little is known about the potential effect that such a large burden
on county facilities could have. Many counties, similar to the state, have opted to construct
more detention facilities [76]. As a whole California jails already are over capacity [77]. More
information about the effects of overcrowding in county jails is currently needed.
