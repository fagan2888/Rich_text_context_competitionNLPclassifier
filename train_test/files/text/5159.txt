Abstract
Background: A clinical large anterior vessel occlusion (LAVO)-prediction scale could reduce treatment delays
by allocating intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT)-eligible patients directly to a comprehensive stroke center.
Aim: To subtract, validate and compare existing LAVO-prediction scales, and develop a straightforward decision support
tool to assess IAT-eligibility.
Methods: We performed a systematic literature search to identify LAVO-prediction scales. Performance was compared
in a prospective, multicenter validation cohort of the Dutch acute Stroke study (DUST) by calculating area under the
receiver operating curves (AUROC). With group lasso regression analysis, we constructed a prediction model, incor-
porating patient characteristics next to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) items. Finally, we developed a
decision tree algorithm based on dichotomized NIHSS items.
Results: We identified seven LAVO-prediction scales. From DUST, 1316 patients (35.8% LAVO-rate) from 14 centers
were available for validation. FAST-ED and RACE had the highest AUROC (both >0.81, p < 0.01 for comparison with other
scales). Group lasso analysis revealed a LAVO-prediction model containing seven NIHSS items (AUROC 0.84). With the
GACE (Gaze, facial Asymmetry, level of Consciousness, Extinction/inattention) decision tree, LAVO is predicted (AUROC
0.76) for 61% of patients with assessment of only two dichotomized NIHSS items, and for all patients with four items.
Conclusion: External validation of seven LAVO-prediction scales showed AUROCs between 0.75 and 0.83. Most scales,
however, appear too complex for Emergency Medical Services use with prehospital validation generally lacking. GACE is
the first LAVO-prediction scale using a simple decision tree as such increasing feasibility, while maintaining high accuracy.
Prehospital prospective validation is planned.

Introduction
Time is the most crucial factor limiting clinical effect-
iveness of intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) in stroke
due to large anterior vessel occlusion (LAVO).1,2 With
every minute of delay, 4.2 days of disability-free life
are lost, and chances of undergoing IAT are reduced
by 2.5%.3,4 A clinical scale to identify LAVO in the
prehospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
setting could reduce treatment delays by allocating
IAT-eligible patients directly to a comprehensive
stroke center (CSC).5,6 Ideally, such a scale should be
straightforward, widely applicable, have high interrater
reliability and high accuracy in terms of LAVO-predic-
tion.7 Various scales have been designed, but it is
unclear which performs best in clinical practice.8­15
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Score
(NIHSS) retains the highest overall accuracy predicting
LAVO,16,17 but is too extensive for EMS personnel.
The Face-arm-speech-time (FAST) score is widely
used by EMS personnel but was primarily developed
to distinguish stroke from non-stroke rather than
stroke subtype.18
LAVO-prediction scales were compared before, but
never systematically, and in different datasets with
radiological endpoints not reflecting current clinical
practice.14,19,20
Patient characteristics may improve a LAVO-
prediction model but were not included in previous
scales.21,22
Aims
We aimed to (i) systematically identify published
LAVO-prediction scales designed for prehospital use,
(ii) assess these scales in terms of feasibility, (iii)
assess predictive value in a large, multicenter, prospect-
ive dataset with IAT-eligible LAVO as a well-defined
radiological outcome measure, (iv) compare these
scales to NIHSS and FAST, and finally, (v) develop a
prediction model assessing both NIHSS items and
patient characteristics associated with LAVO.
Methods
Systematic literature search
A computerized literature search was performed in
the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE,
EMCARE and Web of Science from October 1991 to
June 2017 using the following search terms: ``stroke,''
``cerebrovascular accident,'' ``scales,'' ``scores,'' ``large
vessel occlusion,'' ``large artery occlusion,'' ``Emergency
Medical Services,'' ``prehospital'' and ``triage.'' Two
reviewers (GTK and TTMN) independently screened
titles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text versions
were obtained from all studies that were considered to
be potentially relevant by one or both reviewers. After a
first selection, bibliographies of all relevant studies were
searched manually for additional studies and this
method of crosschecking was continued until no further
publications were found. Authors of relevant articles
were contacted for supplementary information.
Cohort studies were reviewed with the STROBE
(Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies
in Epidemiology) statement and had to comply with the
following inclusion criteria: (1) original data report on
an inception cohort or a clinical trial; (2) a clinical score
had to be assessed within 6 h from stroke onset; (3) it
had to be clear from the paper at what moment and by
whom (e.g. EMS personnel, neurologist) a clinical score
was assessed; (4) assessment of LAVO had to be done
with either CT angiography (CTA), magnetic reson-
ance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography;
(5) data available on the performance of clinical
score(s) used had to be expressed as: area under the
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC),
sensitivity/specificity or likelihood ratio, and (6) the clin-
ical score had to be retrievable from NIHSS. Because
studies had to fulfill these strict inclusion criteria, no
further formal quality assessment was undertaken.
We estimated and/or retrieved the following char-
acteristics from identified studies: feasibility for EMS
use, interrater reliability and external validity (i.e.
applicability to the unselected population of suspected
acute stroke patients).
Validation cohort
To assess validity, we used the Dutch acute Stroke
study (DUST) cohort.23 DUST is a multicenter, pro-
spective, observational cohort study conducted in six
university and eight non-university hospitals in the
Netherlands. From May 2009 to August 2013, consecu-
tive patients >18 years presented at the emergency
department with a suspicion of acute (<9 h) ischemic
stroke (based on clinical assessment and non-contrast
CT (NCCT) imaging) and NIHSS >1 and/or con-
sidered eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)
were included. All patients received CTA within 9 h
after symptom onset as part of the CT stroke work-
up including NCCT, CT perfusion and CTA. The
DUST imaging protocol has been described before.24
Analysis
Patients with CTA yielding insufficient diagnostic qual-
ity to assess LAVO were excluded. We defined LAVO
according to current IAT-eligible criteria: proximal
middle cerebral artery (MCA: M1- and/or M2-segment),
proximal anterior cerebral artery (ACA: A1- and/or
International Journal of Stroke, 0(0)

A2-segment), intracranial carotid artery (ICA) or
tandem (ICA plus MCA) occlusion.25 Patients with
incomplete admission NIHSS were excluded from ana-
lyses related to validation of existing scales, since NIHSS
was required to reconstruct these.
Descriptive statistics were used to determine baseline
characteristics of the validation cohort. Categorical
variables were compared with the 2 test and presented
as number (percentage). Continuous variables are com-
pared using the t test or Mann­Whitney U test, and are
presented as mean Æ standard deviation or median
(interquartile range, IQR) if appropriate.
To assess predictive value, we computed AUROC
and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per iden-
tified LAVO-prediction scale, and for the NIHSS and
FAST score.
Having data from 14 sites participating in DUST,
we performed external validation by excluding one site
at a time (cross-validation) for every scale. This is an
important advantage, because external validation gives
a better indication of the generalization error. We per-
formed all pairwise comparisons of the cross-validated
AUROCs of the various scales using the DeLong's test.26
For the development of a new prediction model, we
did not exclude patients with NIHSS items that could
not be assessed since this reflects clinical practice.
In addition, we introduced (combinations of) patient
characteristics into the model that we considered to
be predictive of LAVO provided that these also differed
on baseline between LAVO and non-LAVO patients.
These include: history of atrial fibrillation (AF), AF
without the use of anticoagulation, and AF without
diabetes mellitus and/or hyperlipidemia.
Group lasso regression analysis was used to reveal
(a combination of) NIHSS items and patient character-
istics yielding the highest predictive value for LAVO.27
The lasso is a popular method for penalized regression
and classification that also performs variable selec-
tion.28 The group lasso is a variant where the user
can specify groups of variables (e.g. all variables
within one NIHSS item) that are either all in or all
out of the model.29 We used the R package ``grpreg''
with default settings to fit the group lasso.30
In addition, a decision tree algorithm and diagram
based on dichotomized NIHSS items ((1) `yes/present/
abnormal', or (0) `no/absent/normal') was developed.
A decision tree works by consecutively assessing the
item with the highest predictive value in the (remaining)
cohort, as such leading to a minimum amount of items
to be assessed to reach an outcome (i.e. LAVO or non-
LAVO), with the highest possible predictive value.
Cross-validation (as described before) will determine
the number of knots in the decision tree. The decision
tree was fitted using the R-package ``rpart'' using
default settings. In particular, this means that the default
priors are proportional to the data counts, the losses
default to 1, and the split defaults to the Gini index.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS soft-
ware (version 23, IBM, New York, USA), and R soft-
ware (version 3.4.1).
Results
Systematic literature search
The MEDLINE search yielded 185 citations, the
EMBASE search 263 citations, the EMCARE search
58 citations, and the Web of Science search 163 cit-
ations. After removal of duplicates, 522 records
remained; 446 records were excluded based on title
and abstract; 28 additional relevant studies were found
by searching the bibliographies. Screening reference lists
and a search of the Science Citation Index yielded 12
additional studies. One-hundred-and-sixteen citations
remained for full text assessment. A total of seven clin-
ical scales meeting pre-defined criteria were identified
(see Figure 1). Clinical scale characteristics and methods
of validation are shown in Supplementary Material I.
Except for the RACE scale, all validations were per-
formed retrospectively and/or in-hospital and valid-
ation cohorts ranged between 62 and 3505 patients.
Generally, patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) were excluded. Definition of LAVO varied sub-
stantially between studies (ranging from `MCA occlu-
sion' to `anterior or posterior circulation occlusion'),
and LAVO-rate ranged between 21 and 73%.
Validation cohort
A total of 1393 patients were included in DUST. Of
these, 59 (4%) were excluded because of incomplete
NIHSS and 18 (1%) because CTA was of insufficient
diagnostic quality to assess LAVO. This left 1316
patients for analysis.
LAVO was present in 471 patients (35.8%).
Demographic details of the validation cohort, stratified
by presence of LAVO, are presented in Table 1.
LAVO-patients were similar in age and sex compared
to non-LAVO patients. AF was more prevalent in
LAVO-patients, whereas other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors (previous stroke, hyperlipidemia) and antiplatelet
therapy were more prevalent in non-LAVO patients.
LAVO-patients had higher baseline NIHSS compared
to non-LAVO patients; NIHSS 12 [IQR 7­17] versus
NIHSS 4 [2­7] were more frequently treated with IVT,
and onset-to-needle time was shorter; 97 [72­140] min
in LAVO-patients versus 115 [85­170] in non-
LAVO patients. Median systolic blood pressure was
lower in LAVO-patients: 150 mmHg [133­167] versus
157 mmHg [140­180] in non-LAVO patients.

Comparison of clinical scales
The FAST-ED (AUROC 0.83, 95% CI 0.80­0.85),
RACE scale (AUROC 0.82, 95% CI 0.79­0.84) and
NIHSS (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI 0.79­0.84) showed
the highest AUROC for detecting LAVO in compari-
son with other scales (p < 0.01). FAST-ED showed a
comparable AUROC to RACE but a significantly
higher AUROC than NIHSS (p < 0.01). The FAST
score showed the lowest specificity, and the 3I-SS
scale showed the lowest sensitivity (see Figure 2 and
Table 2).
Group lasso LAVO-prediction model
Group lasso analysis showed a prediction model con-
taining a combination of the following NIHSS items
(AUROC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81­0.87): (1) level of con-
sciousness (LOC) questions, (2) gaze, (3) visual fields,
(4) facial asymmetry, (5) arm motor function, (6) apha-
sia, and (7) extinction/inattention. Whereas AF was
more prevalent in LAVO-patients, it did not contribute
to the prediction model as a separate variable or in
combination with other patient characteristics as out-
lined before.
Decision tree
Figure 3 displays the GACE (Gaze, facial Asymmetry,
level of Consciousness, Extinction/inattention) decision
tree. The GACE decision tree enables prediction of
LAVO by assessment of a maximum of only four pre-
defined dichotomized NIHSS items with an AUROC of

0.76 (95% CI 0.68­0.83). `Gaze', the item with the high-
est predictive value for LAVO in our cohort, is the first
item to be assessed. For both the group of patients with
an abnormal gaze (27%, left side of the diagram) as for
the group of patients with a normal gaze (73%, right
side of diagram), the following item with the highest
predictive value for LAVO is determined. For both
subgroups, this item is `facial asymmetry'. Assessment
of this second item leads directly to an outcome (i.e.
LAVO or non-LAVO) in 61% of all patients (scoring
(a) gaze `yes' plus facial asymmetry `yes', (b) gaze `yes'
plus facial asymmetry `no', or (c) gaze `no' plus facial
asymmetry `no'). Only for the remaining 39% of
patients, the full 4-item decision tree (adding `LOC
questions', followed by `LOC commands' or `extinc-
tion/inattention') has to be completed (see Figure 3
and Table 3).

However, the majority was retrospectively validated in
(small) monocenter cohorts in an in-hospital setting,
making it difficult to determine which scale outper-
forms the other in prehospital clinical practice.
In our large multicenter validation cohort, we found
that FAST-ED and RACE had the highest AUROC
for prediction of LAVO. A seemingly important advan-
tage of RACE over FAST-ED is that it was validated in
the prehospital setting. Nevertheless, RACE appears
too complex for prehospital EMS use, comprising a
5-item, 9-point assessment in which the decision to
use or omit certain scale items (i.e. agnosia, aphasia)
depends on the assumed involved hemisphere.9
Indeed, during the validation phase, the scale was not
performed in 40% of suspected stroke patients.9
Although FAST-ED is based on the widely used
FAST score and outperforms the NIHSS for prediction
of LAVO in our database, it has potential drawbacks as
it (a) imposes scoring a `partial', `mild' or `moderate'
deficit in most items, hampering interrater reliability;
and (b) uses complex items (e.g. extinction/inattention)
which are difficult for EMS personnel to assess.13,31
G-FAST seems more feasible for EMS use.
However, in the original G-FAST study (i) vessel
imaging modality to detect LAVO is unclear, and
more importantly, (ii) definition of LAVO does not

meet current clinical IAT-criteria (excluding ACA and
M2 occlusion).14
In our cohort, as expected, AF was more common in
LAVO-patients. Although neither this nor other patient
characteristics improved the group lasso model, the model
including seven NIHSS-items had a higher AUROC
(0.84) than the scales derived from the literature.
Despite significant differences in performance of the
scales, it should be pointed out that many of these dif-
ferences are associated with small absolute differences
in AUROC (i.e. 0.02). We accepted a small reduction in
AUROC for the GACE decision tree (compared with
the group lasso model), as we estimate that the
prehospital feasibility is high since EMS personnel
only has to take two steps to rule out transportation
to a CSC for a substantial proportion of patients (61%,
see Table 3), and only four for the remainder.
From a clinical perspective, it seems remarkable that
facial asymmetry is such an important scoring item for
GACE since it appears to have little localizing value.32
It is important, however, to bear in mind that it is not
this separate item, but the combination with gaze
assessment that leads to a high predictive value for
LAVO in our cohort.
In addition to LAVO prediction, allocation decision
also depends on (1) the impact of delay on clinical effi-
cacy of both IVT and IAT, (2) patient characteristics
(e.g. medical history, time from symptom onset, course
of the disease) and (3) logistic factors (e.g. urban/rural
area, number of comprehensive and primary stroke
centers (PSC) and distance to scene of stroke, inter-
hospital distance, in-hospital door-to-needle and
door-to-groin times).33 Therefore, we chose to display
ROCs, enabling determination of a clinically relevant
cut-off point considering local circumstances.
Moreover, allocation decision highly depends on
what kind of error one is willing to allow: (a) having
more patients come to a CSC accepting that some of
these may not have LAVO and incorrectly bypass a
PSC delaying IVT (false-positives); or (b) being focused
on only allocating LAVO-patients to a CSC accepting
that some LAVO-patients will primarily be transported
to a PSC without IAT-facilities (false-negatives).

For example, a 75-year-old patient presenting with a
partial gaze palsy, facial asymmetry, dysarthria and
moderate left hemiparesis is assessed by EMS personnel
2.5 h after symptom onset. Scores for this patient on the
best performing LAVO-prediction scales in our valid-
ation cohort are: RACE 4/9, FAST-ED 2/13 and
G-FAST 4/4. When applying the original authors'
cut-off point, the patient has a moderate to high
chance of LAVO, advising direct transport to a CSC
with G-FAST, and a transport to the nearest PSC with
RACE and FAST-ED. These scales, however, do not
take into account local circumstances.
Consider that a PSC is located 10 min- and a CSC
20 min from scene of stroke (with equal door-to-needle
times). Bypassing the PSC is associated with a 10-min
delay to IVT but a more substantial time delay to IAT
is avoided by preventing inter-hospital transfer.
Keeping in mind that IVT has limited efficacy in
LAVO-patients,25,34­39 a scale with a high sensitivity
(such as G-FAST) seems the more desirable for this
specific situation.
However, when transport time to a PSC is only 10
and to a CSC is 50 min, a scale with a high sensitivity is
less desirable. Most patients (including false-positives)
will then be transported to the CSC with a more sub-
stantial time delay to IVT (40 min) for non-LAVO
patients and, in addition, overloading the CSC with a
large volume of patients. Therefore, in this situation, a
scale with a high specificity (such as RACE or FAST-
ED) would probably be the more desired choice.
Overall, time is brain, but since LAVO-patients
appear to clinically benefit more substantially from ear-
lier IAT than overall stroke patients benefit from earlier
IVT,3,40 a moderate to high likelihood of LAVO seems
to allow a fair time delay to IVT. How much delay
exactly, however, remains complex, as logistics (which
are dynamic as resources shift over time) determine the
amount of accepted time delay at expense of the number
of false-positively referred patients. To what extent
implementation of a clinical LAVO-prediction scale
affects local logistics and health care-related costs has
to be estimated, since no formal cost-effectiveness ana-
lysis was performed.
Our study has several limitations. First, our study
was performed retrospectively which could have led
to selection bias. Data, however, were collected pro-
spectively minimizing such an effect. Second, our
cohort does not represent an unselected prehospital
cohort. For example, ICHs were not included, leading
to an artificially high prevalence of LAVO and
IVT-treated patients, which could result in an overesti-
mation of the prediction scales. To what extent this
influences a decision to use a scale depends very much
on local circumstances since ICHs are often concen-
trated in CSCs.
Of note, the retrospective nature and lack of an
unselected cohort account for all LAVO-prediction
scales included in our analysis and therefore do not
diminish validity of between scale comparisons.
Finally, clinical scale assessment was performed in
the in-hospital setting, rendering translation to the pre-
hospital setting limited. Indeed, prospective validation
in this setting is much warranted and our results should
primarily be considered an important step towards
a large prehospital prospective validation study which
we planned to embed in the ongoing `A Reduction
in Time with Electronic Monitoring in Stroke'
(ARTEMIS) trial conducted within three EMS regions,
which allows patients to be electronically tracked from
the first moment the dispatch office is alarmed up until
start of reperfusion therapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT02808806).41
Nevertheless, clinical LAVO-detection could also be
very helpful in order to optimize in-hospital logistics of
potential IAT-eligible patients (e.g. pre-notification of
neuro-interventional team and preparation of the angio
suite can reduce door-to-groin times).42
Conclusion
We identified seven LAVO-prediction scales of which
FAST-ED and RACE performed best and comparable
to the NIHSS. An important limitation remains; how-
ever, that prospective validation in the prehospital
EMS setting is lacking.
We developed a practical and easy-to-use decision
tree that utilizes only two dichotomized NIHSS items
for LAVO prediction for 61% of patients, and four
items for the remaining patients in our cohort.
Prospective validation of GACE in the prehospital set-
ting is planned.
