Are Household Firearms Stored Safely? It Depends on Whom You Ask
Deborah Azrael, MS; Matthew Miller, MD, MPH, ScD; and David Hemenway, PhD
ABSTRACT. Objective. To determine gun storage
practices in gun-owning households with children.
Design. National random digit-dial telephone survey
of 2521 households conducted in March 1999 through
July 1999. This study uses a subsample of 434 households
with children <18 years old in which a respondent re-
ported either: 1) personally owning a gun, or 2) living in
a gun-owning household but not owning a gun them-
selves. Respondents were asked whether any household
gun was currently stored loaded, and, if yes, whether any
gun was currently stored loaded and unlocked.
Results. Twenty-one percent of gun owners com-
pared with 7% of nonowners reported that a household
gun was stored loaded, while 9% and 2%, respectively,
reported that a household gun was stored loaded and
unlocked. Nongun owners were significantly more likely
than were gun owners to be female (87% vs 22%) and to
report that they lived in a house with only 1 gun (70% vs
57%) and no handguns (51% vs 31%). Based on the re-
ports of actual gun owners (n  252), households with
children <13 years old were significantly less likely to
store a gun loaded and unlocked (multivariate odds ratio:
.1; 95% confidence interval: .0,.4) than were households
with teenagers only.
Conclusions. We find that among gun-owning house-
holds with children, nongun owners report significantly
lower rates of guns stored loaded and unlocked than do
gun owners. These findings are consistent with recent
studies that have found that married men are far more
likely to report household gun ownership than are mar-
ried women, and that gun users are far more likely to
report that a gun is stored loaded or loaded and unlocked
than are never users. Our findings suggest that nongun
owners, the vast majority of whom are women (87%),
may be unaware that guns in their homes are stored in a
manner that experts agree is unsafe.
Our findings reinforce the importance of many pedia-
tricians' current efforts to offer anticipatory guidance
about firearms to gun-owning families, and, in addition,
suggest that this guidance can be adapted depending on
whether the physician is speaking with a gun-owning or
nongun-owning parent. In particular, because gun own-
ers (mostly fathers) are less likely to bring children to the
pediatrician's office than are nonowners (mostly moth-
ers), physicians should take advantage of any opportuni-
ties that they have to address gun-related issues with
parents who personally own guns. More commonly, phy-
sicians can encourage nongun owners to participate more
fully in household decision-making about gun storage
by letting them know not only about recommended stor-
age practices, but also that many nonowners may not
know how guns are actually stored in their own homes.

Each year from 1991 to 1996, an average of 175
children 15 years old committed suicide with
a firearm and at least another 190 died from an
accidental gun shot wound. In each of those same
years, 1250 adolescents 15 to 19 years old killed
themselves with guns and another 290 died acciden-
tally. Including deaths from homicide, firearms were
the second leading cause of death (behind motor
vehicles) for both children 10 to 14 and youth 15 to 19
years old1 over these years.
Recent evidence suggests that 75% of the fire-
arms used in childhood and adolescent suicide at-
tempts and accidental shootings are stored in the
home of the victim or in the home of a relative or
friend.2 In the one study to address the issue directly,
the most common scenario for the fatal accidental
shooting of a child was the child playing with a
loaded and unlocked firearm.3 Even among adoles-
cents with no apparent psychiatric disorder, loaded
household firearms seem to be associated with a
higher risk for suicide.4 Implementation of laws de-
signed to encourage safe storage by holding gun
owners responsible for how their guns are stored in
the event a child is injured with a gun are associated
with decreases in rates of accidental firearm deaths.5
Experts from the National Rifle Association to the
American Academy of Pediatrics agree that guns
should be stored in a way that limits access by chil-
dren.6,7
To understand and respond to the problem of
childhood firearm injury--especially suicides and
accidents--it is important to have good estimates of
children's exposure to firearms. This requires infor-
mation on, among other things, the number of gun-
owning households with children and how those
guns are stored. Unfortunately, traditional means of
ascertaining household exposure to firearms through
telephone surveys may be inadequate if some house-
hold adults have incomplete or inaccurate informa-
tion regarding household guns. Recent studies have
found that when a single member of a multiadult
household is interviewed: 1) married men are far

more likely to report that a gun is stored loaded or

We used data from a nationally representative ran-
dom digit-dial telephone survey conducted in early
1999 to explore the accuracy of gun storage informa-
tion provided by adults living with children who
report that there is currently a firearm in their house.
METHODS
The random digit-dial telephone survey was conducted by Fact
Finders, Inc, a social science research firm in Albany, New York
between March 19, 1999 and July 13, 1999. The sample, which is
representative of US households with telephones, comprised 2521
adults 18 years of age and older living in the United States.
Sampling was suspended after the school shooting in Littleton,
Colorado on April 20, 1999 and resumed after a cool-down period.
Comparisons of responses to the questions important to this study
before and after the shooting revealed no significant differences.
The number of interviews designated for each of the states was
determined by that state's population relative to the total popu-
lation of the United States based on 1990 Census figures. Of the
10 774 telephone numbers that were randomly selected, calls to
2588 yielded contact with households that were determined to be
eligible (E) for the survey. Sixty-seven of these households (3%)
declined to participate, yielding 2521 households that completed
the survey (C). Two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine num-
bers were ineligible (I), because they were not working or were not
residential, and the eligibility of 5397 was not known (U, eg,
because there was no answer). Using a Council of the American
Survey Research Organization formula [C/(E  (E/E  I)*U)], we
calculated a response rate for our survey of 49%.12 This response
rate is comparable to that of other national surveys on firearm
ownership9 and falls within the response rates for most Behavioral
Risk Factor Survey firearm modules.13
Using techniques developed by Waksberg,14 telephone num-
bers were randomly generated to include households with listed
and unlisted numbers. The random digit-dial technique is de-
signed to ensure an equal, unbiased probability of inclusion in the
sample of all households with a single telephone line. Once a
telephone number had been randomly selected for inclusion in the
survey sample, as many as 10 repeat phone calls were made to
screen the selected household. Respondents were told that all their
answers were completely confidential, and neither names nor
addresses were recorded.
No 1 adult from each household was interviewed. As a result,
an adult in a single adult household was more likely to be inter-
viewed than was an adult in a household with 1 adult. Thus, the
sample is a representative sample of households, not of individ-
uals. Instead of interviewing the adult who answered the phone or
who happened to be home at the time of the call, the study was
designed to select a household adult chosen at random. In prac-
tice, this meant alternately asking to speak with a man or woman
living in the household. If there was no person of the requested
gender living in the household, the initial respondent was inter-
viewed.
The demographic composition of the sample is fairly similar to
that of the adult population described by the 1990 US Census,
although our survey contains fewer poor people (11% vs 20%)
attributable in part to the requirement that respondents have
telephones, more women (58% vs 51%), and not surprisingly given
our oversampling of women, more households with children 18
years old (40% vs 33%). Because the noninstitutionalized popula-
tion of women is greater than that of men (and single adult
households headed by women outnumber those headed by men),
sampling of women is increased when randomization takes place
at the household level. Given our sampling technique, men and
women in typical 2-adult households were equally likely to be
asked to participate; among the excess of single adult households
headed by women, however, only women were eligible.
This study concerns gun storage among people living with
children 18 years old, so the sample was limited to individuals
with children who reported that they or someone else in their
household currently owned a gun (n  434). The gun ownership
question ("Do you or does anyone else in your household cur-
rently own any type of gun?") was the 11th question of the survey,
after questions about the respondent's feelings of personal safety
and whether they had ever been shot. This household gun own-
ership question was followed by a question about how many guns
were owned by household members, and then by "Do you per-
sonally own a gun?" The dependent variable in our analyses is the
respondent's answer to 2 questions about household gun storage
practices: 1) whether any gun in the household was currently
stored loaded, and, if the respondent answered in the affirmative,
2) whether any gun was stored both loaded and unlocked.
Independent variables include respondent demographics as
well as variables reflecting respondents' firearm-related experi-
ence and behavior. Demographic variables include: respondent
age (50 and 50), gender, race (white or other), community
(urban, suburban, or rural), region (South or other), education
(completed college or not), family income ($35 000 or $35 000),
and in these households with children 18 years old, an indicator
for whether there was any child 13 years old in the household.
Firearm-related variables include: whether any household gun
was a handgun; the total number of guns in the house; whether
the respondent had ever received formal firearm training; and for
respondents who reported that they personally owned a gun,
whether one reason for owning a gun was protection. Additional
independent variables are whether the respondent felt safe alone
in his or her neighborhood at night (very or somewhat safe;
somewhat or very unsafe), thought gun injury was a problem in
their community (major problem; minor or no problem), and had
been the victim of a hostile gun display in the past 5 years
(answered yes to the question: "In the past 5 years has anyone
used, displayed or brought out a gun against you in a hostile
manner, even if this event did not take place during commission
of a crime?" and was not a police officer). The South is defined as
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Loui-
siana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Forty
people (9%) did not reveal their income and 31 (7%) declined to
report how many guns were in the household. Dummy variables
for missing income and missing number of guns were created for
individuals with missing responses.
Bivariate analysis is used initially to explore the relationship
between dependent and independent variables, using the 2 test
for significant differences in discrete independent variables. In
multivariate analyses, logistic regression is used to determine
potential correlates of gun storage practices, while taking into
account potential confounders.
We calculate national estimates of household gun storage prac-
tices by applying survey estimates to the 33 million US house-
holds with children 18 years old reported in the 1990 Census.
RESULTS
Approximately 42% of our random sample of 2521
households (n  1053) reported currently owning a
gun. Of these, 41% (n  434) reported that there were
one or more children 18 years old living in the
household. Results come from this subsample of 434
households (Table 1). Approximately 60% of these
respondents reported that a gun in the household
belonged to them personally (n  252), while 40%
reported that they did not personally own a gun (n 
182). Individuals who personally owned a gun were
significantly more likely than were nonowners to be
male (78% vs 13%; P  .001) and older (2 test for
trend, P  .05), but otherwise possessed similar de-
mographic characteristics.
Compared with gun owners, nonowners were
more likely to report that there was only 1 gun in the
house (70% vs 57%; P  .001) and that there were no
handguns (69% vs 49%; P  .001; Table 2). Although
21% of gun owners said that there was currently a
household gun stored loaded and 9% said that a gun
was stored both loaded and unlocked, only 7% of
nongun owners reported that there was a loaded gun

in the home and 2% reported that there was a loaded
and unlocked one (P  .001 and P  .01, respectively;
Table 2).
Because we expect that gun owners will have bet-
ter information about their firearms and how they
are stored than will nongun-owning adults in the
same household, we analyze gun storage practices
among actual gun owners only (n  252; Table 3).
Among these owners, women (30% vs 18%; P  .05)
and those who lived in the South (31% vs 15%; P 
.01) were significantly more likely to store a gun
loaded, as were those who reported owning a gun
for protection (34% vs 9%; P  .001), and those
whose households contained 1 gun (24% vs 8%;
P  .001) or a handgun (28% vs 5%; P  .001).
Correlates of keeping a gun loaded and unlocked
included living in a rural community (14% vs 5%;
P  .05), owning a gun for protection (17% vs 2%;
P  .001), and reporting that there was a handgun in
the household (12% vs 4%; P  .05). Gun owners
with children 13 years old were less likely than
those with teen-aged children to store a gun loaded
and unlocked (6% vs 17%; P  .01).
In the multivariate analyses, among gun owners,
whites (odds ratio [OR: 3.5; 95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.1,11.3), and those who lived in the South (OR:
2.6; 95% CI: 1.2,5.8) were more likely to report storing
a gun loaded, as were those who reported a house-
hold handgun (OR: 6.0; 95% CI: 1.5,24.0) and those
who reported owning a gun for protection (OR: 3.6;
95% CI: 1.5,8.8). Despite small cell sizes in this anal-
ysis, those who reported owning a gun for protection
were significantly more likely to store a gun loaded
and unlocked (OR: 10.4; 95% CI: 2.2,48.6), while those
with children 13 years old were significantly less
likely to store a gun in this fashion (OR: .1; 95% CI:
.0,.4).
DISCUSSION
This survey provides current, nationally represen-
tative data suggesting that in gun-owning house-
holds with children there is a significant reporting
gap between those who actually own a gun and
those who do not regarding the type, number, and
storage status of guns in the home.
Together with previous work that found that mar-
ried women underreport household gun owner-
ship,9,10 and that those who do not use guns are more
likely than gun users to report that firearms are
stored securely,11 our findings suggest that surveys
that rely on the reporting of a household member
chosen at random may generate underestimates of
both firearm ownership and the prevalence of fire-
arms stored loaded or loaded and unlocked.
Assuming that respondents are answering honestly,
our findings suggest that a troubling information gap
lies behind the reporting gap. Nongun owners (87% of
whom are women) may be unaware that there is a gun
in the house at all; even if they know a gun is present,
they may be unaware that it is stored in a manner that
experts agree is unsafe. Without good information re-
garding household firearms, the ability of these non-
owners to participate in decision-making regarding
household guns, to take reasonable precautions regard-
ing those guns, or to safeguard their children from
them may be compromised.
Given the reporting gap, our analysis of the corre-
lates of various gun storage practices relies on the
reports of actual gun owners only (n  252). In our
sample of gun-owning households with children,
21% of gun owners reported that a firearm in the
house was stored loaded and 9% that it was stored
loaded and unlocked. These estimates are compara-
ble to those from other surveys that interviewed gun
owners only.15 The estimates are generally higher
than those from surveys in which a household mem-
ber who may not have personally owned a gun was
also interviewed16,17 although not always.18
Our study is consistent with others that have
found that among gun owners those who own hand-

guns and those, often the same people, who own
guns for protection are more likely to store these
guns loaded or loaded and unlocked.15,18,19 In our
sample of gun owners, women were significantly
more likely to own a gun for protection than were
men (62% vs 42%; P  .01). However, when we
controlled for whether the respondent owned a gun
for protection, women were no more or less likely
than were men to store a gun unsafely. We also
found that individuals living in the South and whites
were more likely to store a gun loaded.
Although the risk of firearm death is far greater
among older children, having younger children at
home was associated with safer gun storage practices
among gun owners no matter how we defined
younger (from age 8 years and under to age 14 years
and under; data not shown). Compared with house-
holds with teenagers only, for example, gun owners
in households with younger children were signifi-
cantly less likely to store a gun loaded and unlocked,
perhaps because they believe that younger children
are more susceptible to firearm accidents or do not
believe that gun storage effectively limits access to
firearms for older children.

4 of 6 ARE HOUSEHOLD FIREARMS STORED SAFELY?
and without children at home (n  635), those with
children were significantly less likely to store a gun
either loaded (21% vs 32%) or loaded and unlocked
(9% vs 21%) than were those without children (data
not shown). In contrast, and consistent with an in-
formation gap rather than reporting bias, the gun
storage practices reported by nongun owners in
households with guns seem to be largely insensitive
to the presence of children, despite the fact that the
majority of nonowners are women (8% without chil-
dren reported storing a gun loaded, while 7% with
children did; 3% without children reported storing a
gun loaded and unlocked, while 2% with children
did; data not shown).
Surveys have various limitations. Telephone sur-
veys are subject to both random and systematic er-
ror.25 For example, there is random sampling error
associated with all population estimates (eg, 6% for
a population proportion of 50% in a sample of 252)
and systematic error associated with the fact that
individuals without telephones are underrepre-
sented.26 In addition, self-report data are subject to
potential inaccuracies attributable to social desirabil-
ity responses, recall bias, intentional distortions, or
noncandid responses.27
It is possible that among adults in households with
guns, nongun-owning men have more accurate in-
formation about guns than do nongun-owning
women. Because of the small number of male non-
owners in our sample (n  23), however, we lack the
statistical power to disentangle the relationship be-
tween gender and ownership in the reports of non-
gun owners about gun storage.
In our sample, it is possible that some respondents
may have intentionally misreported the storage sta-
tus of guns in their households. If the propensity to
misreport affects gun owners and nongun owners
differently, some part of the large difference in re-
ported gun storage may reflect this reporting bias.
In addition, the survey did not ask how many
adults lived in each interviewed household. There-
fore, it is possible that some of what we attribute to
an information gap between nongun owners (who
we assume live with at least 1 other adult) and gun
owners (who may or may not live with another
adult) is instead attributable to different storage pat-
terns among adults in single versus multiple adult
households. To assess the sensitivity of our results to
this possibility, we used household composition data
from the US Census that indicate that 95% of men
and 80% of women in households with children live
with a spouse. If, for example, we assume that all 5%
and all 20% of single adult gun-owning households
store their guns loaded (biasing our results strongly
toward the null), and remove these households from
our analyses of reporting differences, the reporting
gap persists, with 13% of gun owners but only 7% of
nonowners reporting that a household gun is stored
loaded.
An ideal study might have interviewed all house-
hold members--when the others were not present--
allowing for the comparison of reporting of gun-
owning and nongun-owning adults in the same
household. On all reported demographics except
gender and age, nongun owners and gun owners in
our survey seem similar, however, suggesting that
comparisons between them are reasonable.
Of the 1000 households with children in our
larger survey, 43% contained guns. Applying this
43% figure to the 33 million households with chil-
dren 18 years old in the United States, 14 million
of these households contain guns. Based on the re-
ports of respondents who personally own a gun, 21%
(or 3 million) of these households contain a gun that
is stored loaded and 9% (or 1.3 million) a gun that is
stored loaded and unlocked.
Other studies have found a large reporting differ-
ential between men and women concerning whether
there is a gun in the household. We find a large
reporting differential between gun owners (generally
men) and nongun owners (overwhelmingly women)
concerning how the firearm is stored. Assuming that
respondents are trying to answer honestly, the re-
sults indicate that nongun owners (87% women) in
2-adult households often do not know that there is a
gun in their home, and when they do know, they
believe--incorrectly--that it is stored safely. This can
be a particular problem when, as for our respon-
dents, there are children in the home. Gun storage
practices in the United States may be one reason that,
for 5- to 14-year-olds, our unintentional firearm
death rate is 9 times and our firearm suicide rate 10
times higher than those of other developed coun-
tries.28
Our findings reinforce the importance of many
pediatricians' current efforts to offer anticipatory
guidance about firearms to gun-owning families,
and, in addition, suggest that this guidance can be
adapted depending on whether the physician is
speaking with a gun-owning or nongun-owning par-
ent. In particular, because gun owners (mostly fa-
thers) are less likely to bring children to the pedia-
trician's office than are nonowners (mostly mothers),
physicians should take advantage of any opportuni-
ties that they have to address gun-related issues with
parents who personally own guns. More commonly,
physicians can encourage nongun owners to partic-
ipate more fully in household decision-making about
gun storage by letting them know not only about
recommended storage practices, but also that many
nonowners may not know how guns are actually
stored in their own homes.
