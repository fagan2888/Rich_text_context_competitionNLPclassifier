Objectives. This study used a person­environment (P­E) framework to examine individual capabilities and social and
physical environmental attributes for their association with unmet assistance needs in activities of daily living (ADLs).
Analyses were replicated among five ADLs (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating) and test the relative risk of
apartment dwellers compared to those living in houses.
Methods. Data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey, Supplement on Disability Followback
Survey. Analyses consisted of a nationally representative sample of aged and nonaged adults with one or more ADL
limitations.
Results. Slightly less than 1 in 5 subjects with a specific ADL limitation had unmet needs for that ADL. This was true
across all ADLs. The likelihood of unmet ADL assistance increased with the number of ADL limitations and other health
status indicators. It was at least 50% higher among those living in apartments than in houses and higher among Hispanics.
There were no differences by age or gender.
Discussion. The P­E framework postulates that individuals seek settings matched to their capabilities, but findings
suggest that many are at risk for adaptation at any one time. Specific risk factors are identified. Selection factors like
preferences, expectations, and adaptation options available have not been directly measured.
MORE than 5.4 million American adults living in
community settings need assistance from another person
or special equipment to accomplish basic activities of daily
living (ADLs) like bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and
eating (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 1998).
Growth in home- and community-based care during the 1990s
(e.g., Spillman, Liu, & McGillard, 2002) has afforded the
opportunity for many individuals to live in the community who
might otherwise be in nursing homes or housing with services.
Public concerns about the adequacy of assistance in community
settings have paralleled this growth (e.g., U.S. General
Accounting Office [U.S. GAO], 2003).
One definition of adequacy is the extent to which needed
assistance is unavailable or insufficient. The prevalence of at
least some unmet ADL assistance needs has been estimated.
These rates range from 2.6% to 34.6% (see Desai, Lentzner, &
Weeks, 2001; LaPlante, Kaye, Kang, & Harrington, 2004; Lima
& Allen, 2001; Williams, Lyons, & Rowland, 1997, for an ex-
tensive review) among the aged. Much of this range results from
whether incontinence is included in the definition of toileting
difficulty. In all studies, rates of unmet need increased as the
number of ADL limitations increased and if instrumental activ-
ities of daily living (IADLs; e.g., getting about inside, getting
outside, getting places, shopping, preparing meals, doing light
and heavy housework, using the telephone) defined tasks for
which more assistance was needed.
These prevalence studies have found that living alone, the
number or type of chronic health conditions, race and ethnicity
(i.e., Black or Hispanic), marital status (i.e., divorced or never
married), and limited insurance coverage were also associated
with an increased likelihood of unmet need. Living with a
spouse and use of equipment and assistive devices (e.g., canes,
walkers, bathroom and/or kitchen modifications) were associ-
ated with reduced unmet need.
This article extends the examination of unmet needs in two
ways. First, we use a person­environment (P­E) framework and
broaden the factors considered, assessing the extent to which
physical and social environmental factors are associated with the
likelihood of unmet task assistance. This perspective recognizes
that disability involves the match or fit between individual capa-
bilities and the demands and supports available from the envi-
ronment and that environment includes a host of physical and
social dimensions. Second, we assess whether the risk for unmet
need varies among housing types and among specific ADL limi-
tations. The population studied had at least one ADL limitation.
PERSON­ENVIRONMENT THEORY
P­E frameworks trace back to such individuals as Helson
(1964), Lawton and Nahemow (1973), and Carp and Carp
(1984), among a number of others. The P­E framework guiding
our work is that of Lawton and Nahemow. They postulate that
individuals seek congruence between their capability and the
demands made by their setting and that a match or congruence
between capability and environmental demands (or supports)
helps produce outcomes for the individual, such as life satis-
faction and optimum performance, within that setting. Capability
in this framework includes physical and cognitive functioning,
economic resources, intellectual resources, and social skills.
Environmental factors include physical features, services, and
social components like roles, cultural norms, and social relation-
ships. Mismatches, where demands exceed capability, are
thought to produce stress and inadequate performance. Demands
below capability are thought to produce understimulation and
even an erosion of ability. As capability declines (e.g., due to

2005, Vol. 60B, No. 4, S205­S213
S205
changes in health status or cognitive functioning), other things
being equal, an individual's adaptive range is thought to decline,
with the individual becoming more sensitive to or affected by the
demands from his or her environment. This is known as the
environmental docility hypothesis (Lawton, 1969). We are con-
cerned with identifying the extent of any mismatches, here re-
flected as unmet need for ADL task assistance.
The Lawton­Nahemow framework and variations on it have
been used in many studies, predominantly of elders. Among
other things, these studies adjusted for individual capabilities
and examined the appropriateness and availability of such envi-
ronmental attributes as social supports and service assistance
for their effect on individual outcomes like life satisfaction
(Kahana, et al., 1995), social activity, and relocation (e.g.,
Gitlin, 2003; Longino, Jackson, Zimmerman, Bradsher, 1991;
Speare, Avery, Lawton, 1991). The Lawton­Nahemow frame-
work has also been used to examine moves among the nonaged
with disabilities (Newcomer, Kang, Kaye, LaPlante, 2002).
P­E formulations beyond the Lawton­Nahemow model seek
to incorporate individual preferences or predispositions along
with individual capability and environmental components (see
Lawton, Windley, Byerts, 1982; Wahl & Weisman, 2003, for
a review of these perspectives). These P­E frameworks have
few empirical applications and require measures not available
to this investigation.
METHODS
The study used data from the National Health Interview
Survey--Supplement on Disability Followback Survey (NHIS-
D). Phase I of the NHIS-D was administered as part of the 1994
and 1995 core NHIS interview. The NHIS-D was designed as
a nationally representative survey of community-resident
households. The NHIS core interview is conducted annually
by the Census Bureau for the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) and provides an overview of the general
health and health care use in the civilian, noninstitutionalized
population in the United States (NCHS, 1998). About 40,000
households are surveyed through personal interviews. Items are
self-reported or reported by a household representative.
NHIS-D respondents identified with an indication of disabil-
ity in the interview (criteria included functional limitation,
specific disabling diagnoses, perception of disability, and use of
disability-related services) were reinterviewed 7 to 26 months
later in Phase II of the NHIS-D, also known as the Disability
Followback Survey. Median lag between interviews was 13.6
months. Included in the Followback was information on the in-
dividual's housing, the length of time he or she had lived in
those quarters, and his or her current functional ability (as
measured by ADLs and IADLs). The NHIS-D Phase I began in
January 1994. Phase II concluded in April 1997.
There were 25,805 respondents to the NHIS-D Followback
Survey. Of these, 9,646 (representing 15.1 million people) were
living outside of nursing homes and receiving or needing help
from another person (including supervisory help) with either
ADLs or IADLs. Our analysis included the subset of persons
(representing 5.4 million people) who reported receiving or
needing hands-on and/or supervisory or standby help from
another person in performing at least one ADL task. Inclusion
of those needing supervisory or standby help with those
needing hands-on help allowed for a widened margin for
identifying persons with ADL limitations.
Measures
Items in the NHIS-D Followback Survey reflected a fairly
complete array of individual and environmental measures rep-
resenting dimensions of the Lawton­Nahemow framework.
These are shown in Table 1 with sample counts and weighted
population estimates. Here we discuss the expected theoretical
relationship of each measure to the outcome of unmet assis-
tance needs.
Individual capabilities. --For the purposes of analysis, the
most commonly used individual capabilities are financial and
intellectual resources, health and functional ability, and sensory
and communication ability. Financial and intellectual resources
(i.e., education) are thought to influence access to and pref-
erences for various situations or adaptations. Both household
income and Medicaid eligibility are used here to represent finan-
cial resources. The income item is self-reported and includes
income from employment, business, investments, pensions,
public programs, and other sources. This item does not include
assets. Higher income may provide a family more potential
resources for obtaining assistive services. Medicaid eligibility
affords access to publicly funded community-based services.
Self-reported health status and the ability to perform ADLs
and IADLs are representative of self-maintenance abilities. The
use of 5 ADLs (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating)
and 10 IADLs (getting about inside, getting outside, trans-
portation or getting places, shopping, preparing meals, doing
light and heavy housework, using the telephone, medication
management, money management) are commonly used to
measure disability. We used these 15 items. Another consid-
eration in defining task limitations was whether to include only
individuals receiving or needing ``hands-on'' help or to also
include those needing only supervision or standby help from
another person in performing a task. The selection of subjects
for this study was inclusive of need or receipt of both hands-on
and supervisory ADL assistance. This was done to assure a
wide net for identifying at-risk individuals.
Incontinence, the use of special equipment (i.e., wheelchairs
or walkers, feeding tubes, catheters), and difficulty opening or
reaching cabinets represent inabilities and describe individual
self-maintenance limitations. The latter may also reflect some
adaptations. Cognitive ability reflects limitations requiring spe-
cial adaptation by the individual caregivers. Hearing and vision
problems may be either life long or of recent onset. The varied
nature of these limitations complicates the expected direction of
association with the outcome of unmet need. In the context of
cross-sectional data we might expect that higher frailty and
complex care needs may be seen in a steady-state situation and
thus may be positively associated with more attentive supports.
For example, self-reported health status and financial resources
are associated with home modifications and the use of assistive
equipment (Mathieson, Kronenfeld, Keith, 2002). On the other
hand, a number of studies (e.g., Desai et al., 2001; LaPlante
et al., 2004; Lima & Allen, 2001; Williams et al, 1997) report
that unmet need increases with the number of ADL­IADL
limitations--conditions that may be more subject to change over
the short term.

PERSONAL CARE ASSISTANCE S207
Social resources. --Studies of personal assistance needs
(such as those cited above) typically represent social resources
by marital status, household size, the relationship of household
members, and access to family and friends. The presence of
a spouse and/or family members may increase the likelihood of
informal assistance. Frequent contact with family and friends
may be associated with better quality of assistance and possibly
serve as additional sources of assistance. Paid providers may
supplement family members or primary assistance for those who
are not married or living with family members--decreasing
unmet need. A physician seen regularly is another type of social
resource. We have included this because of possible influences
on disease management and quality assurance relative to the
level of informal care.
Social roles and norms. --Social roles and norms were
represented in our analysis by demographic attributes rather
than direct measurement. Gender may have represented an
individual's experience in various IADL tasks (e.g., shopping,
meal preparation, housecleaning) and expectations about them-
selves or others as to the amount of assistance that might be
appropriate. Age served as a marker for possible generational
differences in attitudes and expectations, including perhaps
some difference in preference or expectation about self-suffi-
ciency and self-directed care. Race and ethnicity may have rep-
resented cultural attitudes, such as preferences and expectations
about self-sufficiency, filial responsibility, and even tolerance
for various levels of discomfort or inconvenience. Race may
also have been a proxy for barriers to access to alternative
living situations.
Physical features. --The physical features of one's living
quarters and setting and how these are associated with unmet
ADL­IADL need have been studied through work focused on
housing modifications (e.g., to the kitchen or bathrooms), design
features (e.g., single multistory units), or the presence of special
equipment (e.g., ramps, handrails, and elevators; Verbrugge &
Sevak, 2002). These features are thought to improve access and
self-efficacy. In cross-sectional analysis the direction of this
effect may be ambiguous, as adaptations may have been made
for those who need them and not all adaptations reduce unmet
need for assistance.
Another element of living quarters is the potentially intrinsic
meaning of ``home'' (Gitlin, 2003). Relocation studies have
drawn attention to this in noting adjustment consequences for
those who have moved. Studies of community-dwelling resi-
dents have found strong preferences to remain in one's home
and the presumed buffer this familiar setting may offer for the
loss of personal autonomy and control (Rubinstein, 1989). The
meaning of home is seldom measured directly. It is much more
common to use proxy measures (as we have done here), such as
a differentiation into owner versus renter, length of time in the
residence, and housing type. The assumption is that extended
residence engenders familiarity with one's home and commu-
nity and a stronger social network. These in turn are thought to
facilitate adaptation and accommodation. Owners may be more
likely to modify the physical features to better meet their needs.
On the other hand, ownership may constrain relocating to a
setting more adapted to one's ability.
Apart from the intrinsic meaning of home, the rights and
privileges of an individual regarding the amount and duration of
assistance may be affected by housing type. For example,
persons living in a house may have fewer constraints (such as
from zoning, fire and safety codes, or concerns from man-
agement or fellow residents) on the services that may be brought
into the setting than an individual living in an apartment. On the
other hand, persons living in houses may experience higher
demands (including IADLs) for the maintenance of the setting.
The direction of effect on unmet need is unclear, but evidence
from the relocation studies cited earlier suggests that moves are
sometimes reflective of adjustments to declining ability, and/or
a preference to remain living independently rather than with
family members.
Both ownership and housing type were used, as the effect
of ownership status would be confounded by the inclusion of
individuals in service-rich settings without adjusting for
housing type. For example, among those with ADL
limitations in the NHIS-D, 79.6% of those in houses were
owners, as were 30.5% of those in houses with services. The
balance in both housing types were ``renters'' (with or without
actually paying rent), as were those in apartments. We have
included measures that distinguish houses, apartments, and
housing with services. These were consolidated from the
housing types in the NHIS-D (Phase II, Section A, question
9). Information about services available in a facility distin-
guished places providing supportive care (e.g., maid service,
meal preparation, medication supervision, assistance in ADLs)
from apartments.
The last element of the environment considered was the
availability of community resources. This was measured indi-
rectly using community size, with the assumption that larger
communities may have had more services and providers
available. Such availability was expected to reduce the prev-
alence of unmet need. More specific measures of locality are
not available in the NHIS-D.
Outcome of unmet need. --The outcome of the P­E match
represented in our analysis is the reported perception of unmet

need for personal assistance. The NHIS-D used branch questions
iterating through each of the ADLs and IADLs to derive
a measure of unmet need. Those receiving or needing help with
a task were asked whether they need more hands-on or super-
visory assistance with that task. Following a convention used by
Lima & Allen (2001), a person who said they have a limitation
but reported that he or she had enough help was classified as
having ``no unmet need.'' Those reporting that they were
receiving help but that they needed more help were considered as
having ``inadequate help'' or unmet need. Those who said they
needed help from another person but did not receive it from
any source were classified as having ``no help,'' and in our study
(due to the small number) they were included in the unmet need
category. Unmet need as a dependent variable was defined in
two ways: (1) those with unmet need for only hands-on help,
and (2) those who had unmet need for either hands-on or super-
vision or standby help.
Analysis
Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN multivariate
logistic regression software (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1997).
Separate models were estimated for each ADL dimension. The
two variations of the outcome measure were used in separate
sets of models. Results were similar with either measure, but
the goodness of fit was slightly higher using only the hands-on
help outcome. Only these results are reported.
All models adjust for differences by the main effect of age
groups, by housing type, and by whether the study subject
reported for themselves or via a proxy interview. We selected
the approach of representing age groups and housing types by
dummy variables (instead of having separate models for these
subgroups) after testing the association of age and housing
dummy variable interactions with each of the other independent
variable relative to unmet need. No such interactions were
statistically significant. The presence of proxy respondents
raised a concern that such respondents might overstate helper
availability or otherwise have differential reporting on other risk
factors relative to self-reports. The effect of proxy respondents
was first evaluated using sets of models that systematically in-
cluded and excluded these respondents. No meaningful differ-
ences in the models' risk factor coefficients were found. A
second step reestimated the model using a proxy main effect and
proxy by covariate interactions. Again, no statistically signif-
icant interactions were found. All dimensions of our P­E
framework are represented by the measures shown in the
models. All measures were entered in a single step.
RESULTS
We investigated the extent to which individual and environ-
mental characteristics demonstrate an association with housing
adequacy as represented by unmet need for personal care
assistance, and whether the direction of association conformed
to P­E theory-based expectations. We gave particular attention
to whether the risk of unmet need differed between those in
houses and apartments once other housing features had been
adjusted for.
Unmet Assistance Need
Table 2 shows the number of persons receiving or needing
more help in each ADL and IADL and a corresponding per-
centage of those reporting unmet need in that activity. There is
a substantial difference in the number of people in these com-
parisons depending on the criteria used to define need. For
example, 4.4 million persons receive or need hands-on as-
sistance in at least one ADL. This estimate increases to 5.4
million if need for supervision is included.
A somewhat less differential pattern occurs among IADLs.
For example, among people needing or receiving help in at least
one ADL, 4.5 million report receiving or needing hands-on
IADL assistance, compared to 5.0 million receiving or needing
any IADL assistance. The number of people with unmet need
varies across ADLs, but the proportion with unmet need is
relatively similar in each ADL. There is more variability among
IADLs. In both ADLs and IADLs the proportion with unmet
need diminishes going from hands-on assistance need to the
more inclusive any assistance needs. More than 800,000 per-
sons reported unmet need for hands-on assistance in at least one
ADL. This increases to 900,000 persons if unmet supervision
help is also considered. Bathing, transferring, and dressing were
the most prevalent unmet ADL needs. Almost 1.2 million
people with at least one ADL limitation also had unmet needs
for at least one IADL task, with housework, assistance walking
or getting outside, preparing meals, and shopping being the
most common unmet IADL needs.
Correlates of Unmet ADL Assistance Needs
Table 3 shows logistic regression results for each of five
ADLs using the outcome of unmet need for hands-on assis-
tance. The sample in each model was limited to persons with
that particular ADL limitation. Similar results (available from
the authors) were obtained using the broader outcome of unmet
need for either hands-on or supervisory assistance.
Within a sample defined by having a limitation in at least one
ADL, intellectual capabilities represented by education level
had no statistically significant relationships to unmet ADL need.
Being eligible for Medicaid (the one financial capability
indicator used) tended to have a protective relationship toward
reducing unmet need, but this achieved statistical significance
only in bathing and transferring. Household income failed to
show any statistically significant effects. Physical health and
functional capabilities revealed varied effects. The indicators of
limitations in physical functioning (e.g., number of ADL or
IADLs, incontinence, and fair to poor health) were associated
with increased risk of unmet need in all models. Most of these
odds ratios were statistically significant and of similar mag-
nitude. Persons using special equipment (e.g., use of tracheot-
omy tube, respirator, catheter, or feeding tube in the past 12
months), and those having difficulty communicating with per-
sons outside the family tended to have a lower risk for unmet
need. About half of these odds ratios were statistically signif-
icant. Indicators of specific disability subpopulations (e.g., use
of a wheelchair or walker, vision limitations, frequently con-
fused, disoriented, or forgetful, or difficulty reaching or opening
cabinets) tended to produce odds ratios approaching 1.0 and
were statistically nonsignificant.
Several social resources variables (i.e., living with others,
having a spouse provider or a paid helper, and having a proxy
respondent) were associated with a reduced likelihood of un-
met need. Most of these odds ratios were statistically significant.
The frequency of getting together with or talking to friends
PERSONAL CARE ASSISTANCE S209
and family members outside one's household tended to be
associated with reduced unmet need risk, but only one of the
models (eating) was statistically significant. Seeing a physician
regularly and length of time in the current residence had no
significant association with unmet need nor a consistent pattern
of effects.
Among the social roles and norms measures, gender generally
had odds ratios approaching 1.0 and no statistically significant
associations. When compared with younger adults with
disabilities, those aged 65 and older showed an inconsistent
pattern of unmet need and no statistically significant odds ratios.
Whites compared with the other racial groups showed a lower
likelihood of unmet need for all but eating. These effects were
statistically significant for bathing and dressing and for any
unmet need. When compared with other racial/ethnic groups,
Hispanics showed an increased likelihood of unmet need across
all ADLs. These effects were at similar levels in all models and
were statistically significant in all but the two least prevalent
conditions--eating and toileting.
Physical environment included items representing features of
the living unit and its geographic location. These items were
evaluated for their independent effects on unmet need, but their
most germane function was to adjust for features that might
otherwise be confounded with the living quarters classification
of the house, apartment, or housing with services. Being in
urban areas of greater than 1 million persons and having ramps

kitchen modifications tended to show increased risk of unmet
need, but only two odds ratios were statistically significant.
Automatic or easy-open doors and an elevator or stair glide had
odds ratio tending toward 1.0. Bathroom modifications, while
generally showing no association with unmet need, had
a statistically significant association with reduced risk for
both eating and transferring unmet need.
Apartment dwelling, compared with those living in houses,
was generally statistically significant, with apartment dwellers
having an increased risk for unmet need. The robustness of
housing type relative to homeownership was tested using
separate models both with and without housing type. Home-
ownership was not significant even when housing type was
omitted. The odds ratios on most of the other covariates were
similar with either the inclusion or omission of the dummy
variable indicative of apartments and housing with services.
These relationships remained testing apartment and design
feature interactions (e.g., by race and unit modifications and
features) and interactions among some features (e.g., number of
floors by the presence of an elevator and unit modifications by
difficulty using cabinets). These interactions (not shown) were
not statistically significant. Housing with services, although
suggesting an association with increased risk, was rarely
statistically significant, perhaps due to the small sample.
Analyses of unmet IADLs need were conducted among our
sample of persons with at least one ADL limitation. These
results are available from the authors. Compared with the
prediction of unmet need for ADL assistance, each attribute
showed similar patterns in associations with unmet need, but
fewer measures in the P­E model had statistically significant
associations. Living in an apartment, as compared with living in
a house, showed a statistically significant increased risk for
unmet IADL assistance in walking assistance (OR ¼ 2.1) and
getting outside (OR ¼ 2.6). Odds ratios approached 1.0 for the
other tasks.
DISCUSSION
This article applies a P­E framework to examine individual
and environmental attributes for their association with living
arrangement adequacy. The analyses involve a nationally
representative sample of adults with at least one ADL limitation.
Living arrangement adequacy was represented using reported
unmet need for hands-on ADL assistance. We sought to deter-
mine the relative contribution of individual capabilities, social
resources, social roles and norms, and physical environmental
measures and adjusted for these factors to assess whether those

living in apartments were at higher risk for unmet need than those
living in houses. Services available from the housing facility
distinguished apartments from housing with services.
The P­E framework postulates a propensity to seek settings
matched to one's capabilities, but it is notable that just under 1 in
5 of those with an ADL limitation had unmet needs for that ADL.
This was true across all ADLs. The consequences of unmet
personal assistance needs (e.g., housing changes, relocations,
family interventions to change primary helpers or to augment
helper assistance) cannot be determined from cross-sectional
data, but the rate of unmet need suggests that many with ADL
limitations may be seeking adaptations at any given time.
Among the several dimensions of the P­E framework,
financial capability represented by Medicaid eligibility (and its
potential access to public programs) was associated with reduced
unmetneed in all ADLs, withthe exception of eating. Asin earlier
studies, the likelihood of unmet need increased as the number of
ADLs increased. Other physical capability measures (e.g., fair or
poor health, incontinence) were also evidence of an expected
increased likelihood of unmet need, but there were important
exceptions. Persons using special equipment and those with
difficulty communicating had a lower risk of unmet need.
Physical capability findings taken together (consistent among
individual ADLs) suggest that at a point in time long-standing
disabilities may be reasonably well accommodated and that
conditions subject to change over a short period are more likely to
be out of P­E match. A corollary is that if special needs have not
been addressed, then those with these disabilities likely have not
remained in the setting.
The inclusion of social and physical environmental features
adds further insight into influences on unmet need. Several social
resources (i.e., living with others, having a spouse or paid
providers, and having a proxy respondent), in common with
findings of unmet need in the literature, were associated with
lower unmet need in ADLs. Living with others, at a minimum,
likely affects the timeliness and availability of assistance. This
effect seems to be further enhanced by having a spouse provider
or a paid provider. Counter to expectations, social resources--
like frequency of talking to or getting together with family and
friends (that they are not living with), years in one's residence,
and seeing a physician regularly--had no significant association
with unmet need. When viewed within the context of the P­E
framework, this finding may reflect the situational adjustments
already in place. For example, the absence of an observed effect
from the social contact measures and years in one's residence
may be attributable to the high prevalence of social contacts
among the sample and a function of individuals having previ-
ously substituted among social resources (including living with
others) to obtain acceptable levels of social interaction. Physician
effects, also nonsignificant, may be explained by the high
prevalence of physician use among the study population--those
with at least one ADL limitation.
Age, gender, and race were used to represent social roles and
norms and had varied effects. Whites, when compared with other
racial groups, tended to have lower risks for unmet ADL
assistance, especially tasks of bathing and dressing--ADLs that
are perhaps the most easily addressed and that are the least
disruptive to a household. Hispanics tended to have higher risks
for unmet needs than non-Hispanics. This pattern was present for
all ADLs, with the exception of eating. Whether these findings
are the result of cultural preferences or individual expectations
about appropriate levels of care or differential access to assistance
cannot be determined from the NHIS-D. Nevertheless, one might
consider whether the lower prevalence of unmet need among
Whites is due to the presence of more assistance in the home
versus a prior period selection and relocation to alternative living
settings (e.g., housing with services or nursing homes) where
such assistance might be available. Conversely, higher unmet
need prevalence among Hispanics may be a reflection of either
a willingness on the part of caregivers (or the respondent) to
accept higher levels of frailty among household members or an
inability (including possibleracial discrimination) to findsuitable
alternatives.
Age and gender did not show systematic associations with
unmet ADL needs. In the context of the P­E model, this suggests
that there are few gender or age group differences in preferences
or expectations about appropriate ADL assistance. Such a finding
likely requires further investigation with direct measurement of
preferences and expectations.
Physical environmental features were incorporated into the
analysis to assess the extent to which they modulated and/or
complemented the individual attributes and social resource
affects commonly used in analysis of unmet ADL needs.
Particular attention was given to possible differences between
those living in houses versus those living in apartments. Those
living in apartments were about 50% more likely to report unmet
ADL needs than those living in houses. The analysis controlled
for specific design features (number of floors, room and door
modifications, presence of lifts and elevators) to partial out any
effect of these features and not spuriously attribute them to
housing type. Additional analyses (not shown) tested interactions
of housing type with the individual capability measures and
social resources. These tested whether there were any capability
and resource differences associated with living quarters. These
interactions were not significant.
The finding of higher unmet need among those living in
apartments is consistent with the notion that apartment residents
may have more restrictions on services or unit modifications
than those residing in houses, but at least three other
explanations are suggested by theory. One is that the familiarity
and even meaning of ``home'' may be stronger among those
living in houses than apartments. Some would suggest that such
a connection may enhance the ability to accommodate to one's
level of needs. Another interpretation is that selection factors
may be differentiating those living in houses from those living in
apartments, with apartment residents perhaps being more
willing to ``accept'' certain levels of unmet need as a trade-off
for living independently or because the alternative may be
a transition into a higher (and undesired) level of care. A
corollary to the selection hypothesis is that those living in
houses have a lower threshold of unmet needs adaptation
(perhaps due to the higher daily living demands of a house,
things such as housekeeping and maintenance, and poorer
proximity to shopping). A lower threshold would suggest that
adaptations, such as obtaining higher assistance levels or
relocation to alternative settings, may occur either more quickly
or in anticipation of assistance needs.
While there are theory-based explanations for the finding of
differences between apartment and house dwellers, there is still
the risk that this difference may be attributable to unmeasured

attributes. For example, even though we adjusted for income, the
presence of paid providers, and household size in our models,
there may be differentials we did not measure. One of these might
be that those in houses have more disposable income to hire more
paid help hours. This might be particularly true among home-
owners with paid-off mortgages. Houses, too, might provide
more room for family and other helpers to stay as needed,
including short-term stays.
Finally, while the P­E framework suggests several plausible
explanations for the risk of and/or reduction in unmet personal
assistance needs, it is important to recognize that this study has
not directly tested the adaptations that are attempted and/or made,
nor examined the consequences of continued unmet need. Panel
studies are needed to determine whether unmet need is protracted
and whether those withoutsupport relocate outofthe community.
In this vein, we call particular attention to those with special
equipment needs, cognitive impairment, or social isolation. The
observed low prevalence of unmet need may belie avoidable
circumstances that in a prior period may have ``selected'' against
those with these limitations.
Similarly, physical features, including many unit modifica-
tions, were found to have little relationship to unmet need in the
context of cross-sectional data. These findings should not be
interpreted as evidence that design features have no value for
those with limitations. The main function of these items in this
study was to help achieve unbiased estimators on housing type
and to minimize a spurious attribution of a housing type effect
when the underlying factor might be a design feature. More
refined and time-specific comparisons are required for an
evaluation of efficacy. Our analysis measured the presence of
a feature, but not whether it was appropriate or sufficient for the
limitations of the individual in that setting at that time. An
illustration of the potentially complex relationships is that of
kitchen modifications and widened doorways and hallways.
These tended to be associated with increased, rather than dimin-
ished, unmet ADL need. Such a counterintuitive relationship
seems more plausibly explained by these modifications having
occurred in a prior period than in causing the unmet need.
In addition, more work is needed for better understanding of
the multiple factors that may be operating to influence the
observed race and ethnicity differences. We suggest possible
selection effects associated with preferences, expectations,
structural barriers, and discrimination, but a full investigation
of these issues requires direct measurement of these phenom-
ena.
