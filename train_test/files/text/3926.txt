Introduction
The concept of a local hematopoietic renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) in bone marrow (BM) was first suggested in
1996.1,2 Locally active BM RAS affects critical steps of
physiological and pathological blood cell production in
autocrine, paracrine and intracrine ways.3,4 The stimulation
of the angiotensin type 1 and 2 receptors (AT1/AT2) by
angiotensin II (Ang II), the principal effector molecule of
the RAS, exerts an stimulatory/inhibitory action on the
janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion (JAK-STAT) pathway, which is directly linked to
activities of the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and other
hematopoietic cytokines during normal hematopoiesis and
in myeloproliferative neoplasms.3,5,6 Local RAS is effective
even at the stage of primitive embryonic hematopoiesis.7,8
There is preliminary evidence that local BM RAS could
affect neoplastic hematopoiesis.9­16 Over-expression of the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (CD 143) surface
antigen in leukemic myeloid blast cells have been detected
by flow cytometric analyses. Moreover, a positive correla-
tion has been found between theACE and BM blast count.11
ACE and p53 expressions were detected in the CD34+cells
of patients with acute leukemia during and after induction
chemotherapy.17 ACE-expressing macrophages in lymph
nodes of Hodgkin's disease have been detected.15 The renin
system is present in the K562 leukemic cell line in vitro
model. Multipotential, hematopoietic malignant K562 leu-
kemic blast cells also exhibited significant expressions of
RENIN, ANGIOTENSINOGEN (ANGTS) and ACE.14

Abstract
There is preliminary evidence that the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could affect neoplastic hematopoiesis. The
aim of this study is to search messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of the essential RAS elements in myeloid and lym-
phoid hematological neoplastic disorders. Forty-six patients with newly diagnosed myeloid (AML, biphenotypic leukemia,
CML) or lymphoid (CLL, NHL, B-ALL, T-ALL) hematological disorders were included in the study. In the lymphoid
group, the median expression values of RENIN, ACE1, ACE2 and ANGIOTENSINOGEN (ANGTS) mRNAs were 1.96%,
0.42%, 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively; in the myeloid group, 0.73%, 1.55%, 0.04% and 0.006%, respectively. In the lym-
phoid group, RENIN levels were significantly higher (p = 0.001), whereas ACE1 and ACE2 levels were significantly higher
in the myeloid group (p values were 0.013 and 0.010, respectively). ANGTS levels were similar in both groups. In patients
with non-ALL lymphoid malignancies, RENIN expressions were significantly higher when compared to ALL patients
(p = 0.004). All patients with active disease had significantly higher RENIN mRNA expression levels than patients without
active disease (2.03% vs 0.30%) (p = 0.034). The result of our present study indicates that the activities of local RAS may
differ in distinct disease states such as leukemia and lymphomas.

ACE1 and ACE2) in myeloid and lymphoid hematological
neoplastic disorders. Elucidation of the presence of local
RAS in the neoplastic myeloid and lymphoid pathological
hematopoiesis is important because targeting the actions of
local RAS may represent a valuable therapeutic option for
the management of cancer.18­20
Materials and methods
Study population
The study group comprised 46 newly diagnosed myeloid
(acute myeloid leukemia (AML), biphenotypic leukemia,
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)) or lymphoid (chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(NHL), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), T
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)) hematologi-
cal disorders. The diagnoses of hematological neoplasms
were reached based on the criteria of the World Health
Organization (WHO).21,22 Samples from BM were col-
lected prior to the chemotherapy administered to each
patient. The BM aspiration procedure from the iliac crest
was performed only at the clinically indicated situation.
At the time of the sample collection, all of the patients
were in good health and well hydrated. Pediatric and adult
patients receiving chemotherapy were excluded from this
study. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants and the study protocol was approved by the
local ethics committee of Hacettepe University with pro-
ject number LUT 10/45.
Isolation of RNA and synthesis of cDNA
BM samples were collected in 2-ml ethylenediaminetet-
raacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Total RNA was isolated
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen,
Germany). RNA quality was measured by spectrophotom-
eter (ND-1000, Nanodrop Technologies, Inc., USA), and
one microgram of total RNA was used. Random primers
(20 µM, Roche Diagnostics, Germany), dNTP set 10 mM,
Fermentas UAB, Lithuania), RiboLock Rnase Inhibitor
(20 U/µl, Fermentas) and Moloney murine leukemia virus
(MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/µl, Fermentas)
were used for cDNA synthesis. cDNA samples were
stored at -20°C.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis (qRT-PCR)
We searched for the gene expression of the major RAS
components (ACE1, ACE2, RENIN and ANGTS) in myelo-
blasts and lymphoid hematopoietic cells by qRT-PCR. The
probes used in this study were designed by Universal Probe
Library (UPL, https://www.roche-applied-science.com/sis/
rtpcr/upl/index.jsp). The primer forward and reverse
sequences used in this study are shown in Table 1. mRNA
expression levels were normalized to three reference genes
(CYPA, B-ACT and ABL).
qRT-PCR analyses for ACE, RENIN and ANGTS gene
expressions were performed using a LightCycler 480
instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Real-time amplification
was performed with a final reaction mixture of 20 µl con-
taining 5 µM of each primer, 0.5 µM of each probe,
LightCycler 480 Probe Master Mix and 100 ng/µl of
cDNA. Each sample was studied in duplicate and all runs
were repeated twice. The PCR protocol was as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 7 min, amplification seg-
ment at 5 sec at 95°C, 10 sec at 60°C, and 10 sec at 72°C
for 45 cycles.
The 2­Ct method was used to calculate relative expres-
sion levels determined from the RT-PCR experiments.23
Statistical analyses
Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences v13.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for all statistical
analyses. The results were given as the mean ± standard
error for the data with normal distribution, and as median
(min-max) for the data without a normal distribution and
ratio for the nominal data. Data distribution was tested with
Kolmogorow-Smirnow's test. Homogeneities of variances
were evaluated with Levene's test. Nonparametric tests
were used since the sample sizes of the groups were small.
Differences between two groups were assessed by the
Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of  0.05 was considered
as statistically significant.

Results
BM samples were obtained from 46 patients, with lym-
phoid (n = 30) or myeloid (n = 16) hematological
neoplasms (Table 2). The comparison of the two groups on
the basis of biochemical parameters yielded significantly
higher concentrations of hemoglobin, platelet, creatinine
and calcium levels in the lymphoid group; while lactate
dehydrogenase levels were significantly higher in the mye-
loid group.
RENIN,ACE1,ACE2 and ANGTS mRNA expressions
Specific mRNA expressions for the components of the
RAS were detected in the BM samples by qRT-PCR analy-
sis. RENIN mRNA expression levels were found to be sig-
nificantly higher in the samples of the lymphoid group
compared to the samples of the myeloid group. Seven of
the nine AML patients, and all ALL (B- and T-) patients
expressed RENIN. Only two AML patients with minimal
differentiation/without maturation did not express RENIN.
On the other hand, ACE1 and ACE2 mRNA expressions
were found to be significantly higher in myeloid group
patients when compared to the lymphoid group (Tables 3
and 4).
We also analyzed separately ALL and non-ALL patients
versus those in the myeloid group. RENIN expressions
were significantly higher in non-ALL patients, similar to all
lymphoid patients, and ACE expressions were significantly
lower than the myeloid group expressions. However, in
ALL patients vs those in the myeloid group, there was bor-
derline significance with respect to ACE2 mRNA expres-
sion levels in favor of the myeloid group (Table 5). There
was no difference between ALL patients and non-ALL
patients in terms of ACE1, ACE2 and ANGTS gene expres-
sion levels (p = 0.082, p = 0.803, p=0.977, respectively).
On the other hand, RENIN expressions of non-ALL patients
were significantly higher when compared to ALL patients
(p = 0.004).
Active disease status in all patients
RENIN mRNAexpression levels of patients with active dis-
ease were significantly higher than those from patients
without active disease (p = 0.034). No significant statistical
difference existed between the patients with or without
active disease with respect to the ACE1, ACE2 and ANGTS
(Table 6) mRNA expression levels.
Active disease status in lymphoid group
RENIN, ACE1, ACE2 and ANGTS mRNA expression levels
were similar in patients with and without active disease
(Table 7). All patients with ALL had active disease at the

time of diagnosis. However, the rest of the lymphoid group
(CLL, NHL) included patients with or without active
disease. We re-analyzed the data by separating the
ALL patients from the rest of the lymphoid group; the
RENIN, ACE1, ACE2 and ANGTS mRNA expressions of
the patients with or without active disease were similar.
Discussion
In this study, specific mRNA expressions of the compo-
nents of the RAS (RENIN, ANGTS, ACE1 and ACE2) were
detected in the BM of patients with myeloid and lymphoid
hematological neoplastic disorders. RENIN expression lev-
els were significantly higher in the lymphoid group,
whereas ACE1 and ACE2 expression levels were signifi-
cantly higher in the myeloid group. Moreover, RENIN
expression levels in all patients with active disease were
significantly higher than in those without active disease.
These data further support the original hypothesis that there
is a local RAS in the BM affecting physiological and patho-
logical hematopoiesis.1,2 The main RAS molecules, includ-
ing renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin receptors and
ACE had been previously detected in the rat BM microen-
vironment.24 We have found the same RAS molecules in
human samples, indicating that local hematopoietic RAS is
a universal autocrine-paracrine system. The results of our
present study also indicate that the activities of local RAS
may differ in distinct disease states such as leukemia and
lymphomas.
Renin, as an aberrant leukemic marker of acute leuke-
mia, was expressed in leukemia cell lines such as K562,
KU812 and MEG-01.14,25,26 Renin-like enzyme activity due
to specific immunoreactive renin-like peptide of 47 kDa
converting angiotensinogen to Ang-I had been detected in

leukemic myeloid blast cells.27,28 Increased activity of the
renin gene was detected during the NUP98-HOXA9
enhanced blast formation.29,30 Gómez-Casares et al. previ-
ously disclosed renin expressions in cells from AML, CML
and ALL. The highest frequency was observed in AML
patients (47.2% of the cases).25 Renin expression disap-
peared during the complete remission of AML.25,26 The
same investigation team has analyzed 76 samples taken
from patients with AML with follow-up of the positive
patients. Thirty-one patients (41%) were positive for renin
gene expression at diagnosis in their study. All of the renin-
positive patients at diagnosis showed no expression during
complete remission (CR), but expression recurred in those
experiencing relapse and persisted when the disease was
refractory to treatment.26 In our study, RENIN expressions
were found to be significantly higher in the lymphoid group
in comparison to the myeloid group. After dividing the
lymphoid group into two groups including ALL patients
and non-ALL patients, we noticed that RENIN expressions
were significantly higher in the non-ALL patient group
when compared to RENIN expression levels of the ALL
patient group. Thus, the difference of the RENIN expres-
sion levels between lymphoid and myeloid groups was
likely to be due to the non-ALL patient group. Furthermore,
RENIN gene expression levels of the patients with active
disease were significantly higher than the expression levels
of the patients without active disease (p = 0.034). These
findings indicate that RENIN is an active molecule for both
myeloid and lymphoid neoplastic disorders.
ACE existence throughout hematopoietic ontogeny7,8
indicates primitive hematopoiesis casts attention on the
effects of RAS on neoplastic tissues. Immunohistochemical
studies have shown the possible role of ACE/RAS in BM
by evaluating ACE expression in normal BM, several mye-
loproliferative disorders and myelodysplasia.31 ACE and
p53 expressions were detected in the CD34+ cells of
patients with acute leukemia during and after induction
chemotherapy.17 ACE-expressing macrophages in lymph
nodes of patients with Hodgkin's disease have been
detected.15 Enhanced ACE activity was also linked to mul-
tiple myeloma.32,33 ACE hyperfunction results in faster
hydrolysis of the AcSDKP peptide, which in turn decreased
in BM tissues, allowing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to
enter the S stage of the cell cycle.9,34 Ang 1-7 can be formed
directly from the major RAS peptide Ang-II by the actions
of the enzyme ACE2 and also from the Ang-I peptide. Mas
receptors present in the BM microenvironment mediate the
proliferative effect of Ang 1-7 on HSCs.35
Deficiency of ACE2 in BM-derived cells increased
mRNA abundance of a macrophage marker (F4/80) and
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in the stromal vascu-
lar fraction of retroperitoneal adipose tissue, suggesting
increased infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue
of chimeric mice lacking ACE2 in leukocytes.36 In our
study, ACE1 and ACE2 expressions were found to be sig-
nificantly higher in the myeloid neoplastic disorders when
compared to the lymphoid cancers. Our results confirm
previous observations that ACE is an important molecule
in the pathobiology of leukemias.3,4 ACE inhibitors have
inhibitory actions against leukemic cells via induction of
apoptosis in vitro. A Spanish group37 investigated the
effect of captopril, trandolapril and losartan on the K562
leukemic cell line and K562 transfected with c-myc, bcl-x
and bcl-2 (KmycB, Kbclx and Kbcl2, respectively). ACE1
and losartan inhibited cell growth, decreased c-myc
expression and increased apoptosis in leukemic cells. The
pro-apoptotic effects of the RAS blockers were associated
with the Ang-II induced Smad activation.37 Therefore, the
place and function of ACE in hematological neoplasia are
not just an academic issue but deserve to be investigated
for the management of tumors in future trials.
Human umbilical cord blood cells express RENIN,
ANGTS and ACE mRNAs.38 Savary and colleagues detected
the expression of ACE, RENIN, ANGTS and the chicken
Ang-II receptor at a stage when blood circulation is not yet
established and systemic regulation of blood pressure by
the RAS is therefore not yet required. It therefore seems
likely that the RAS is locally functional. The location of
ACE in the extraembryonic endoderm, in contact with the
first blood islands differentiating in the posterior extraem-
bryonic mesoderm, puts ACE in a strategic position for
primitive erythropoiesis. In vivo inhibition of the enzyme
by a specific ACE inhibitor or application of a specific
antagonist of the chicken Ang-II receptor resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in both the hematocrit and the mitotic
index of erythroid cells.39
ANGTS, ACE and RENIN mRNA expressions are
increased in polycythemia rubra vera.40 Leukocytes also

expressed the ANGTS gene, synthesizing and releasing
angiotensinogen with the capability to generate angioten-
sin.41 CML patients had increased ACE, ANGTS and RENIN
mRNA levels, and these expression levels decreased fol-
lowing administration of imatinib. Expressions of RAS
components were studied in patients with CML at the time
of diagnosis and at three, six and 12 months after diagnosis
by qRT-PCR. De novo CML patients had increased ACE,
ANGTS and RENIN mRNA expression levels, and these
levels decreased following administration of imatinib. The
RAS activities were significantly different among Sokal
risk groups of CML, highlighting the altered biological
activity of RAS in neoplastic disorders. Therefore the
hematopoietic RAS affects neoplastic cell production,
which may be altered via administration of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate.16 In our study, ANGTS
gene expression levels were similar in myeloid as well as
lymphoid patients with or without active disease. Paracrine
and autocrine activities of the renin and ACE seem to be
superior to angiotensinogen in the pathobiology of hemato-
logical neoplastic disorders.
The contributions of the RAS components to primitive
and neoplastic hematopoiesis are evident.3,4 AT type 1a
(AT1a) receptors are present on human CD34+CD38­
cells, CD34+CD38+ cells, lymphocytes and stromal cells.
Ang-II, the main effector peptide of RAS, increased hemat-
opoietic progenitor cell proliferation by acting on AT1a
receptors present on the CD34+ HSCs.42 Ang-II was found
to be acting as an autocrine growth factor for AML.43 BM
AT1 expression levels of the myeloma patients disclosed
positive correlation with their BM infiltration pattern and
tumor load indicated by serum beta 2 microglobulin lev-
els.33 The pharmacologically developed drug Ang-1-7 is
already in phase I/II clinical trials for the modulation of BM
RAS in distinct disease states.44,45 However, since most of
the cellular effects of the local RAS are in an autocrine,
paracrine and intracrine fashion, future drugs intended to
modulate local RAS functions shall be prepared to have
local targeted actions in the tissue microenvironment, such
as inside BM.
Conclusions
The results of our present study indicate that the activities
of local RAS may differ in distinct disease states such as
leukemia and lymphomas. These data further support the
original hypothesis that there is a local RAS in the BM
affecting physiological and pathological hematopoiesis.
