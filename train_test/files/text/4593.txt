Background and Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as
"a condition in which the number of red blood cells or
their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet the
physiological needs" (WHO, 2011). Anemia is one of the
most common and widespread nutritional deficiency dis-
orders in the world. WHO global database on anemia for
1995-2011 estimated a global prevalence of anemia among
the women of reproductive age at 29.4%, affecting over
528.7 million women (Stevens et al., 2013; WHO, 2011).
Despite a significant decrease in the prevalence of anemia
among pregnant women (43% to 38%) and nonpregnant
women (33% to 29%) during the 1995-2011, anemia was
a leading cause of 68.4 million years lost with disability
(YLD) among women (Ezzati, Lopus, Dogers, Vander, &
Murray, 2002; Kassebaum et al., 2014; Stevens et al.,
2013; WHO, 2011). It causes adverse consequences on
maternal and child health outcomes such as low birth
weight, neonatal and maternal mortality (Agarwal et al.

Abstract
Despite the existence of several policies and programs, anemia among pregnant and lactating women continues to be
a serious concern for public health policy in India. The main objective of this study is to examine the prevalence and
determinants of anemia among pregnant and lactating versus nonpregnant nonlactating (NP-NL) women for priority setting
in health policies of the country. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS3) conducted in 2005-2006 has been
used for the analyses of this study. The results revealed that the prevalence of anemia was higher among lactating women
(63%), followed by pregnant women (59%) than NP-NL women (53%). Younger lactating (71%) and older pregnant women
(67%) had a higher burden of anemia. Along with socioeconomic factors, demographic indicators such as children ever born
and program factors like nutrition advice and supplementary nutrition during anti natal care and postnatal care emerged
as significant predictors in the case of anemia among both pregnant and lactating women, while socioeconomic indicators
emerged as critical factors in the case of anemia among NP-NL women. Hence, targeting demographic and program factors,
along with key socioeconomic and demographic factors in public health policy, is critical in reducing anemia among lactating
and pregnant women, while targeting significant socioeconomic factors is the key for reducing anemia among NP-NL women.

However, the burden of anemia is not uniformly distrib-
uted across regions or countries in the world. Within the
pregnant and lactating women, the anemia prevalence gap
between developed and developing countries is large. For
instance, it is only 14% in developed countries, while it is
much higher in developing countries (51%). Among the
developing regions, it is highest in Central and West Africa
(56% among pregnant and 48% among nonpregnant) fol-
lowed by South Asia (52% among pregnant and 47% among
nonpregnant; Balarajan et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2009;
Stevens et al., 2013; WHO, 2015; WHO, 2011; Rana & Goli,
2016). Also, maternal deaths due to anemia were also
reported to be highest in developing countries (Balarajan
et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2009; WHO, 2008, 2011). In par-
ticularly in countries like India, it is as high as 60% to 70%
in 2005-2006 (Kalaivani, 2009; McLean et al., 2009; Toteja
et al., 2006).
The prevalence of anemia also varies considerably by
population characteristics like age, sex, socioeconomic sta-
tus and biodemographic factors like pregnancy and lactation
(Bentley & Griffiths, 2003; Florentino, 2003; Haidar, 2010;
McLean et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2008; Vijayalakshmi &
Mercy, 1994; Wadgave, 2011). Women in the reproductive
age group are more vulnerable to iron deficiency resulting in
anemia, especially during pregnancy and lactation as they
are physiologically and nutritionally at a higher risk (Brooker,
Hotez, & Bundy, 2008; Elzahrani, 2012; Picciano, 2003).
Similarly, a lactating mother requires highly nutritious food
to accumulate calories for the production of adequate quan-
tity of milk without deteriorating her health (Picciano, 2003;
Raman, Primala, Bhalla, Venkateshwar, & Iyengar, 2001).
Yet women in developing countries often fail to consume
additional food and supplements required to meet the
demands during pregnancy and lactation because of fetal
growth, alterations in maternal tissues, metabolism, and
breast feeding (Aikawa, Khan, Sasaki, & Binns, 2006; Baig-
Ansari et al., 2008; Kotecha, Nirupam, & Karkar, 2009).
Inspite of significance of the problem, anemia among
pregnant and lactating women has not received the requisite
attention from public health policy in developing countries.
In India, the previous study on the prevalence and complica-
tions of anemia in pregnancy was in 1998-1999 using large-
scale National Family Health Survey (NFHS). This study
highlights the maternal anemia contribution to an intergen-
erational cycle of poor growth of the foetus and low birth
weight (Kalaivani, 2009). The focus of other recent studies
on this subject was restricted to either small-scale field or
hospital-based surveys with limited geographical coverage
(Lokare, Karanjekar, Gattani, & Kulkarni, 2012; Sharma
et al., 2008; Vivek et al., 2012). In this study, we aim to deter-
mine the prevalence of anemia levels and factors associated
with it among pregnant and lactating women vis-à-vis
NP-NL women in India, a setting where a substantial propor-
tion of the population suffers from food insecurity and a poor
social security mechanism (Siddiqui, Goli, Reja, & Shruti,
2017). In particular, through a comparative assessment of
levels and factors associated with anemia among pregnant
and lactating women vis-à-vis NP-NL women, we have
investigated two objectives: first, to highlight the level of
physiological disadvantage of pregnant and lactating women
compared with NP-NL women in India; second, to identify
the factors affecting anemia among pregnant and lactating
women vis-à-vis NP-NL women to prioritise specific targets
in the policy for these categories of women.
Data and Methods
Data Source and Study Population
We used data from the NFHS3 conducted in 2005-2006 by
the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS),
Mumbai, under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. The
NFHS-3 survey was conducted in 20052006 as part of the
global Demographic Health Survey (DHS). It was a nation-
wide representative sample survey of 109,041 households,
124,385 women in the age group 15-49 years. Including the
information on fertility, mortality, morbidity, and maternal
and child health, this is the only major survey in India that
has collected a comprehensive nutrition data with represen-
tative samples from all the 29 states of India, covering more
than 99% of the national population. The samples of preg-
nant (n = 5,911), lactating (n = 21,973) and NP-NL (n =
97,418) women are adequate to carry out the robust statisti-
cal analysis.
Outcome Variable
The outcome variable in the study is the presence of any ane-
mia (yes = 1/no = 0). The NFHS used HemoCue blood test to
estimate the hemoglobin level in grams per deciliter blood.
The anemia status of the surveyed women was classified into
severe, moderate, mild, and any anemia based on WHO
guidelines (WHO, 2011). Severe anemia level was defined
as hemoglobin <7.0 g/dL for both pregnant and lactating
women, and <8.0 g/dL among NP-NL women. Moderate
anemia was defined as 7.0 to 9.9 g/dL for pregnant and lac-
tating women, and 8.0 to 10.9 g/dL among NP-NL women.
Mild anemia was defined as 10.0 to 10.9 g/dL in pregnant
and lactating women, and 11.0 to 11.9 g/dL in NP-NL
women. Any anemia was defined as the hemoglobin level
below 11.0 g/dL in pregnant and lactating women, whereas
<12.0 g/dL in NP-NL women.
Predictor Variables
Based on an extensive review of existing literature
(Kalaivani, 2009; Lokare, Karanjekar, Gattani, & Kulkarni,
2012; McLean et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2008;
Toteja et al., 2006; Vivek et al., 2012), we considered
Siddiqui et al. 3
socioeconomic and demographic factors such as duration
of pregnancy (<3/3 to 6/>6 months), age (15-24/25-34/35+
years), total children ever born (no child/one to two/more
than two), place of residence (rural/urban), religion (hindu/
muslims/others), caste (sc/st/obc/others), education (no
education/primary/secondary&above), mass media expo-
sure (no/any), partner's education (no education/primary/
secondary&above), and wealth quintile (poorest/poorer/
middle/richer/richest) as demand-side predictors of anemia
and pregnancy registration with ANM (Auxiliary Nurse
Midwife; yes/no), recieved nutrition advice at least once
(yes/no) and receipt of any supplementary nutrition (yes/
no) as supply-side predictors of anemia.
Statistical Analyses
Bivariate analyses were carried out to assess the level of ane-
mia among pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL women by socio-
economic and demographic characteristics of women by
applying appropriate sampling weights. Chi-square test was
used to test the statistical significance of bivariate differ-
ences in anemia prevalence across the socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics. Furthermore, binary logistic
regression models were used to assess the net effects of sev-
eral confounding factors associated with the occurrence of
anemia among pregnant and lactating vis-à-vis NP-NL
women. Alpha level was set at 0.05 to determine the statisti-
cal significance of variation in the prevalence of any anemia
estimated as an adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence
interval across the categories of the predictor variables. All
analyses of this study were carried out using STATA 13.
Results
Sample Distribution of Study Population
Table 1 presents the distribution of women by outcome and
predictor variables. Out of the total sample of currently mar-
ried women in the age group 15 to 49 years, around 4% were
pregnant while 18% lactating and 78% were NP-NL at the
time of the survey. The distribution of women by socioeco-
nomic and demographic profile shows that the majority of
women in all three samples were Hindus (81% pregnant,
83% lactating, 86% NP-NL), belonged to the age group of 25
to 34 years (66%), and lived in rural areas (76%). By social
group, the results revealed that 40% to 41% of total women
in pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL categories belonged to
other backward class. Furthermore, the results also show that
46% of total pregnant women had no education, while this
figure was 51% and 38% for lactating and NP-NL women,
respectively. Around half of pregnant and lactating women
had exposure to any form of mass media. The occupation-
wise stratification suggested that 23% of the pregnant
women, 28% of lactating women, and 39% of NP-NL women
were employed at the time of the survey. In terms of health

care seeking and nutrition, 43% of pregnant women had reg-
istered their pregnancy with ANM, 58% had taken nutrition
advice at least once from either doctor or ANM, but only
17% had received supplementary nutrition from the
Anganwadi centers.
Prevalence of Anemia and Its Predictors
Figure 1 illustrates the prevalence of any anemia (in percent-
age) by age. Older pregnant women have a higher burden of
anemia than younger ones. The prevalence of anemia among
lactating women peaked at the age of 16 to 18 years (75%)
and then showed a decreasing trend up to the age of 20 to 22
years (59%), followed by a steady increase. The prevalence
of anemia among these women peaked after age 38 years
(70%). Lactating women showed a higher burden of anemia
at younger ages, while the prevalence of anemia was steady
and varying between 50% and 55% throughout the reproduc-
tive span among NP-NL women. Furthermore, on grouping
the age into broad categories, the results revealed that older
pregnant women (aged >35 years) had a greater prevalence
of moderate and severe anemia than middle age or younger
women. Lactating women of younger ages (15-24) were
found to have a higher burden of mild (48%) and moderate
(21%) anemia. Thus, the prevalence of anemia gradually
increased with the increase in duration of pregnancy among
pregnant and lactating women. It was found to be higher
among women in the third trimester of gestation.
The overall distribution of women in different categories
by anemia levels showed that pregnant women had a higher
prevalence of severe anemia (2.2%) compared with lactating
(1.7%) and NP-NL (1.8%). However, the prevalence of any
anemia was higher in lactating women (62.9%) than preg-
nant (58.7%) and NP-NL women (37.8). Across all the cate-
gories (pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL women), the
rural­urban differences in the prevalence of anemia persist.
However, the rural­urban difference in the prevalence of

(0.7%) than lactating (0.1%) and NP-NL women (0.4%).
Women belonging to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe
had a significantly higher burden of anemia than other back-
ward classes and Others in all three types of anemia mea-
sures. In the case of severe anemia, the caste differences in
anemia risk among pregnant women were much greater than
lactating and NP-NL women. Differences in the prevalence
of any anemia were also observed among different educa-
tional subgroups across pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL
women. These differences were observed to be higher among
pregnant women (2.3%) than lactating (1%) and NP-NL
women (0.5%). Likewise, the same pattern was found regard-
ing partner's education. Furthermore, the proportion of
women in all categories who were exposed to mass media
had a lower burden of any anemia than those who did not
have any exposure. However, these differences were much
higher in the case of severe anemia among pregnant women
than lactating and NP-NL women.
Differences in prevalence of anemia by employment sta-
tus were observed across all three categories of women.
However, the volume of difference was not uniform across
the three groups of women. For instance, a higher percentage
of anemia was found among pregnant and lactating women
than NP-NL women in currently employed category. Among
those suffering from severe anemia, the educational differ-
ences were greater in pregnant women compared with lactat-
ing and NP-NL women. Although the rich­poor gap in the
prevalence of anemia was substantial across the women in all
the categories, it was quite substantial in pregnant and lactat-
ing women than NP-NL women.
Furthermore, the results on the prevalence of anemia by
supply-side factors showed that women who registered their
pregnancy with ANM had better hemoglobin levels than
their counterparts, although the differences were not signifi-
cant. However, women who had taken nutrition advice and
supplementary nutrition from ANM had lower hemoglobin
levels compared with their counterparts (Table 2).
Adjusted Odds Ratio of Anemia Prevalence and
Its Determinants
Table 3 presents the results of logistic regression analysis of
anemia prevalence among pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL
women while controlling for background characteristics.
The adjusted odds of anemia prevalence was found to be
higher among multigravida pregnant women (odds ratio
[OR] = 1.4, p < .01) than in primigravida pregnant women
(OR = 1). The odds of women having anemia were higher
among pregnant women who were employed (OR = 1.33, p
< .01) compared with their unemployed counterparts (OR =
1). However, with reference to the women whose husbands
were not educated, pregnant and lactating women with edu-
cated partners were less likely to be anemic. The possibility
Siddiqui et al. 5
of having anemia was less among pregnant women in the
richest households (OR = 0.65, p < .05), richer households
(OR = 0.70, p < .05), and poorer households (OR = 0.75, p <
.05) compared with poorest households (OR = 1).
Furthermore, the results revealed that women who registered
their pregnancy with ANM were less likely to be anemic.
Likewise, the results also show that pregnant (OR = 1.26, p
< .05) and lactating (OR = 1.40, p < .05) women who took
nutrition advice at least once during their pregnancy were
more likely to be anemic compared with those women who
took no advice during their pregnancy (OR = 1). Similarly,
the results also showed that pregnant women who had
received any supplementary nutrition from Anganwadi were
more likely to be anemic (OR = 1.25, p < .05) compared with
those women who had not received any other supplementary
nutrition during pregnancy (OR = 1).
Discussion and Conclusion
Despite the fact that India was the first developing country to
implement a national program to prevent anemia with nota-
ble attention to control anemia during pregnancy and lacta-
tion, the severity of the problem remains. Anemia is still a
major public health issue of greater magnitude for the coun-
try. The recently published fact sheets based on NFHS-4
information from IIPS and MoHFW (2017) suggest that,
despite the rigorous efforts of government to reduce the
prevalence of anemia in terms of free distribution of Iron
Folic Acid (IFA) tablets and free advice on the nutritional
requirements during pregnancy and lactation, the prevalence
of anemia (50.3%) in India remains one of the highest in the
world. The prevalence of anemia among NP-NL women (15-
49 year) had increased from 52% in NFHS-1 (1992-93) to
53% in NFHS-4 (2015-16). Unfortunately, the unit level data
of anemia in post-2006 is not available in public domain to
carry out detailed analyses.
Nevertheless, the unit level analyses based on NFHS-3
data suggest that anemia is not uniformly distributed, rather
it is heavily skewed toward disadvantaged group of women.
For instance, pregnant and lactating, and NP-NL women liv-
ing in rural areas, those belonging to a younger age group,
and scheduled caste and scheduled tribe are at greater risk of
having anemia. These women suffer more because of demand
side factors. They have less purchasing power to obtain
required levels of supplements, protein, and vitamins during
pregnancy and lactation (Agarwal et al. 2006; Goli,
Rammohan, & Singh, 2015; McLean et al., 2009; Picciano,
2003). In addition to disadvantaged socioeconomic status,
women in vulnerable demographic status such as younger
lactating and older pregnant women are also at an increased
risk of anemia. Akin to previous studies in other countries
(McLean et al., 2009; Picciano, 2003) findings from this
study supports that the later stage of pregnancy, concurrent
lactation, and higher parity are associated with higher risk of
anemia among lactating and pregnant women. However,
pregnant women in their first trimester have a lower risk of

being anemic as compared with lactating and NP-NLwomen;
this may be because of the ceased menstruation during preg-
nancy, increase in blood cell volume, minimal growth of the
foetus and placental tissues, with additional iron intake and
consumption of healthy food during early pregnancy
(Agarwal et al., 2006; McLean et al., 2009; Toteja et al.,
2006; Vijayalakshmi & Mercy, 1994).
In addition to identifying the demand-side factors, this
study also attempted to identify the supply-side factors which
determine the prevalence of anemia among pregnant, lactat-
ing and NP-NL women, although association is weak and
statistically not significant. Anemia is found to be more
among those who received program benefits as compared
with others. It may be because nutrition advice and supple-
mentary nutrition provided by frontline health workers under
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) is targeted
toward disadvantaged women who are already suffering
from anemia. Women from better-off households seek nutri-
tion advice and supplementary nutrition from private health
care. Nevertheless, these findings give a strong message that
the program interventions are ineffective to bring them out of
vicious cycle of anemia.
Overall, based on the findings of this study, we emphasize
on the importance of varying effects of sociodemographic
factors in predicting anemia levels in pregnant and lactating
women. In particularly, in a country where the fertility rate is
still reasonably high, sociodemographic factors plays a major
role in the depletion of women's iron stores during preg-
nancy and lactation and lead to anemia Bentley & Griffiths,
2003; Baig-Ansari et al., 2008; Lokare et al., 2012; Rana &
Goli, 2016; Vijayalakshmi & Mercy, 1994; Vivek et al.,
2012). Thus, the central point as reiterated in the study is that
the factors affecting anemia are multifactorial, ranging from
disadvantaged socioeconomic and demographic status (poor
economic status, no education, early marriage and childbirth,
and higher parity) to unavailability of health care provision
such as access to free nutritional supplements and dietary
advice (Ezzati et al., 2002; Kotecha et al., 2009; Kozuki
et al., 2012; Lokare et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2008). The
study also indicate that the factors associated with anemia
among pregnant and lactating women may not be the same as
factors associated with anemia prevalence among NP-NL
women. While improving socioeconomic factors are the key
strategy for reducing the prevalence of anemia among
NP-NL women, but improvements in both sociodemographic
and supply-side factors related to health care programs are
crucial to reduce prevalence of anemia in pregnant and lac-
tating women.
In the context, where the successive NFHS (1-4) rounds
show that anemia in pregnant and lactating women has
dropped only marginally from 58% in 2005-2006 to 50% in
2015-2016 in a period of 10 years, there is a strong need to
work around the suggestive measures arising from this
study. In particular, strengthening and monitoring the exist-
ing programs (e.g., ICDS, Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya
Karyakram [RKSK]; Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram
[JSSK]; Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and
Adolescent Health [RMNC-A]; National Food Security Act
[NFSA]), removing bottlenecks in accessing to programs by
promoting awareness and health knowledge among women
regarding nutrition and health care is critical for improving
anemia among women in India. Anemia as a public health
issue in developing country like India can not be eradicated
without interventions right form childhood-to-adolescence
to reproductive ages rather than targeted programmes at the
time of pregnancy and lactation (Goli, Rammohan & Singh,
2015). Moreover, addressing the specific needs of pregnant,
lactating, and NP-NL women through effective health care
delivery system would help in reducing the prevalence of
anemia in India. Increased outreach of health services, train-
ing, and motivating frontline health workers not only for
pregnancy registration but also for promoting knowledge
about balanced nutrition, nutrition rich food, dietary diver-
sity and provision of supplementary nutrition is crucial to
prevent anemia among pregnant and lactating women.
Similarly, ensuring women's access to information on risks
of early childbirths, lower birth intervals, and higher parities
and engaging in risky occupations during pregnancy are
also important to reduce anemia among pregnant and lactat-
ing women. The government must take proactive efforts to
prevent anemia through effective campaign for motivating
women to take iron tablets according to the prescribed

schedule. Also, tracking anemic children from schools and
making interventions will help girls to improve their nutri-
tional status and reduce anemia during pregnancy and lacta-
tion. Furthermore, to reduce the burden of maternal anemia,
the government should target disadvantageous areas and
social groups where the purchasing power, knowledge, and
access to health care facilities are minimal. The health care
policies must remove bottlenecks and restructure existing
interventions to consider the heterogeneous groups of
women and their specific nutritional needs. Government has
to remove financial barriers in purchasing nutrition-rich
food during pregnancy by implementing the NFSA, 2013 in
its full spirit. Similarly, different programs aimed at improv-
ing the socioeconomic status of the households should also
be integrated into the policies of reproductive and adoles-
cent health care to reduce iron deficiency and anemia among
women in general and the lactating and pregnant women in
particular. The policies aiming to enhance the planning of
births by appropriate timing of births, improvement in birth
spacing, and avoid unwanted or higher order births through
family planning are critical to avoid depletion of maternal
fat and tissues in women which make them more vulnerable
to anemia.
