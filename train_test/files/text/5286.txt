Introduction
As of March 2011, 51.5% of managers in the United States
were women, but only 14.4% of executive officers and a mere
5.2% of the CEOs were female (Catalyst, 2011). Researchers
strive to identify the barriers women face in the pursuit of
advancement in organizations in the United States and explain
how women of high professional achievement have over-
come barriers to career advancement including gender bias,
conflicting behavioral expectations (the double-bind), chal-
lenges to networking, and difficulties initiating mentor rela-
tionships. Research found that engaging in career planning
can help women proactively manage their careers, navigate
obstacles to advancement, and overcome gender bias and ste-
reotypes to obtain executive level leadership positions in the
United States organizations (Sabattini, 2008; Warren, 2009).
Providing organizational support for career planning and
advancement can help organizational leaders retain talented
female middle managers and close the leadership gap, which
will only widen further as millions of baby boomers leave
the workforce in the next 10 years (Green, 2007; Levanon &
Cheng, 2011; Rogers et al., 2011).
For the purpose of this study, a distinction was made
between career development, career planning, and career
planning strategies. Career development was defined as the
application of programs, training, and development opportu-
nities provided by the employer to assist employees with
professional development and advancement (Lalli, 2009).
Career paths, career maps, education, training, and work-
shops are all common components of career development
programs, and assist employees with the implementation of a

The Female Executive's Perspective
on Career Planning and Advancement
in Organizations: Experiences With
Cascading Gender Bias, the Double-Bind,
and Unwritten Rules to Advancement
Dasie J. Schulz1 and Christine Enslin2
Abstract
Gender bias continues to play a role in the gender discrepancy at executive levels in organizations across the United States,
although women hold 51% of all middle management positions. Female middle managers may be overlooked for advancement
to executive positions because of a lack of synergy between individual career planning and organizational development and
advancement practices. This may have significant implications for organizations as they struggle to recruit and hire qualified
senior leadership to close the widening leadership gap created as baby boomers leave the workforce in record numbers over
the next decade. One way to retain talented, knowledgeable, female middle managers is to incorporate career planning and
advancement programs, which increase visibility for both the individual and organizational leaders into potential advancement
opportunities. This descriptive phenomenological study was designed to investigate and describe the lived experiences of
female executives with career planning and advancement in organizations. Data collected from 16 female executives employed
in organizations in Nashville, Tennessee, revealed that although individuals must make a commitment to career planning and
take responsibility for executing the plan, successful career planning and advancement are dependent on others beyond the
individual seeking advancement. The findings of this study are important for women who desire advancement to executive
levels and to organizational leaders who want to hire and promote the right person for the job regardless of gender.

career plan (Van de Ven, 2007). Career planning was defined
as the action taken to access individual values, desires, goals,
interests, and career aspirations. Career planning also encom-
passes evaluating opportunities; setting career goals; engag-
ing in purposeful networking; hiring a career coach; obtaining
career counseling; identifying and taking advantage of edu-
cational and developmental opportunities; and actively seek-
ing the advice and guidance of trusted peers, managers, and
subject matter experts (Dagley & Salter, 2004; McGrath,
Zell, & Vance, 2013).
Women in organizations often face obstacles in obtaining
mentors, especially female mentors who may have better
insights into the challenges women face in achieving
advancement in organizations (Enslin, 2007; Evans, 2009).A
study conducted by Raggins and Cotton (1991) found that
women had restricted access to mentors and reported a lack
of availability and willingness of male leaders to engage in a
mentoring relationship with females. A second study found
that women who successfully gained access to male mentors
were significantly less likely to engage in and benefit from
networking and bonding opportunities available outside
work hours (Raggins & Cotton, 1999). Herminia (1992) and
Sabattini (2008) pointed out that a lack of access to social
bonding presented an obstacle to advancement for women in
organizations and has consequences for career advancement
manifest in the underrepresentation of women in executive
positions.
Career planning was identified as one of the unwritten
rules to advancement for women in organizations, and female
executives who participated in past research studies explor-
ing the hurdles to advancement for women wished they had
discovered and applied career planning earlier in their careers
(Evans, 2009; Sabattini, 2008; Sabattini & Dinolfo, 2010).
Career planning can help women overcome obstacles to
advancement in organizations by helping the individual gain
the self-awareness to make the appropriate career choices
and helping individuals identify and leverage development
tools appropriate to achieving long-term personal and pro-
fessional growth (Thurgate & Jackson, 2011). Insights
gained from engaging in career planning with employees
may also help organizations develop and implement pro-
grams, policies, and procedures that more adequately pro-
mote gender equality in recruiting, hiring, promotion, and
succession planning practices (Levanon & Cheng, 2011;
Guthridge, Komm, & Lawson, 2008; Rogers et al., 2011).
Creating a partnership between motivated female employ-
ees and organizational leaders by implementing a compre-
hensive career planning element in the talent management
system may be effective in mitigating the loss of female tal-
ent in organizations. Creating a partnership may also help
organizational leaders close the leadership gap and mitigate
the loss of experienced workers as older workers begin to
retire and leave the workforce in larger numbers (Green,
2007; Levanon & Cheng, 2011; Rogers et al., 2011).
Organizations that create customized career paths and devel-
opment opportunities improve both employee loyalty and
customer loyalty (Benko & Weisberg, 2007). The transpar-
ency and detail available through customized career plan-
ning allow individuals and organizations to leverage career
development tools to maximize the potential of the individ-
ual and to meet both individual and organizational growth
objectives (Adomaitien & Zubrickien, 2010). Increasing
employee retention rates and promoting from within saves
organizations millions of dollars in costs associated with
high employee turnover (Benko & Weisberg, 2007).
Research Question
This study was organized around one central question and
six sub-questions. The central research question was as fol-
lows: What are female executives' perceptions of experi-
ences with career planning and advancement in
organizations?
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework for this study provides a founda-
tion for understanding the obstacles to the advancement of
women in organizations in the United States and includes the
theory of cascading gender bias (Warren, 2009), the double-
bind dilemma (Catalyst, 2007), and the unwritten rules of
advancement (Sabattini, 2008). Each of these theories
describes implications of gender bias for perceptions of
women as leaders and the influence of gender stereotypes on
the advancement of women in organizations. These studies
address the hurdles women face as they pursue advancement
in organizations and provided the theoretical underpinning
for this study.
Cascading Gender Bias
The theory of cascading gender bias identified potential for
leadership bias to influence organizational human resource
management system. Warren (2009) described the double-
bind dilemma and the unwritten rules to advancement as side
effects of gender bias, which can prevent women from
advancing to the executive suite. Warren identified three
major contributors to gender bias in talent management sys-
tems: senior leadership effect, institutionalizing bias, and
compounding bias.
Senior leadership effect describes two phenomena that
contribute to cascading bias. First, because both male and
female managers apply a think leader­think male perspec-
tive to performance evaluation, women are disadvantaged
when being considered for leadership positions, regardless of
the gender of the hiring manager or influential organizational
executive (Jackson et al., 2007; Warren, 2009). Second, peo-
ple generally prefer to work with and associate with others
who share their beliefs, values, and interest. Generally, peo-
ple feel most comfortable with others most similar to them-
selves. Consciously or subconsciously, organizational
leaders apply gender stereotypes to establish preferences
Schulz and Enslin 3
among potential candidates for executive openings and influ-
ence decisions about who is hired or promoted to top posi-
tions (Warren, 2009). Because the majority of organizational
executives are male, it stands to reason that the majority of
individuals promoted to executive positions will also be
male (Rosenfeld, 2009; Warren, 2009). Senior leadership
effect influences who gets assigned to high-visibility proj-
ects, takes part in networking opportunities, and receives
mentoring (Sabattini, 2008; Sabattini & Dinolfo, 2010;
Warren, 2009).
Stereotypes are built into talent management procedures,
programs, and tools and contribute to institutionalizing bias
(Warren, 2009). Career path planning, secession planning, and
mentoring programs can magnify the influence of leadership
bias on the hiring, development, and promotion processes
built into talent management systems. Advancement and suc-
cession planning criteria are often established and dictated
with top-down influence in organizations. Little consideration
is given to whether criteria identified include characteristics or
traits that incorporate or perpetuate gender bias.
Warren (2009) described compounding biases as "gaps
between the design and execution of talent management pro-
grams compound the disadvantages faced by women, espe-
cially those seeking professional development and
advancement" (p. 6).
Double-Bind
The double-bind dilemma for women in leadership estab-
lished that women in organizations struggle to overcome
contradictory demands for performance, behavior, and lead-
ership. Catalyst (2007) described a double-bind as a set of
conflicting demands that require women demonstrate contra-
dictory behaviors that set them up for harsh judgment no
matter which behavior is adopted and forces women to
choose between equally unsatisfactory alternatives (Catalyst,
2007). The double-bind manifests itself in three predica-
ments--extreme perception, the high competence threshold,
and competent but disliked--and is manifest in masculine
leadership theory and stereotypes (Catalyst, 2007).
Extreme perceptions are a manifestation of gender stereo-
types, which create the tendency for women to be described
as nurturing and compassionate. Such stereotypes create a
predicament in which, when female leaders behave as
expected (nurturing and compassionate), they are labeled too
soft. Alternatively, if a female leader is assertive and firm
(unnurturing and uncompassionate), that woman will be
labeled too tough.
High competency threshold describes a predicament in
which women must deliver to higher standards than male
counterparts, often for smaller rewards. As a result, women
face the high competency threshold when they are required
to prove leadership ability repeatedly or when they must per-
form more consistently and at a higher level than male coun-
terparts only to receive the same or lower compensation,
recognition, or opportunities.
The predicament described as competent but disliked
describes the phenomenon in which female managers and
executives are challenged with balancing passiveness with
assertiveness to satisfy the expectations of colleagues and
managers. Regardless of experience, performance results,
ability, influence, or use of power, female managers must
endure constant scrutiny and judgment from others who
inevitably label them as too-soft or too-hard. Competent but
disliked is a predicament that describes the dilemma of being
seen either as someone who takes-charge or someone who
takes-care. The result is that " . . . female leaders are per-
ceived as likable or competent, but rarely both" (Catalyst,
2007, p. 8).
Unwritten Rules of Advancement
The theory of unwritten rules for advancement identified
specific, undocumented behaviors that influence upward
mobility in organizations. Sabattini (2008) described net-
working, gaining visibility, leveraging organizational poli-
tics, developing strong communication skills, demonstrating
strong performance, obtaining mentoring, working long
hours, and having a career plan as significant factors in the
unwritten rules for advancement. Failures to identify,
acknowledge, and adhere to the unwritten rules for advance-
ment could delay or even derail one's career. The unwritten
rules to advancement were identified as a hurdle for women
seeking advancement to executive levels in organizations
because female workers often learn about the unwritten rules
through observation and trial and error, rather than from rela-
tionships built through mentoring or networking, and not
knowing may delay or derail advancement (Sabattini, 2008).
Methods, Techniques, or Modes of
Inquiry
A descriptive phenomenological design was appropriate for
this research study because the purpose of this research was
to explore and describe female executives' experiences and
perceptions pertinent to career planning and advancement in
organizations. Ten in-depth interviews and two focus groups
were used to thoroughly investigate and describe experi-
ences and perceptions. Focus group interviews involving
three female executives each were leveraged to triangulate
the data collected in the in-depth interviews and confirm the
themes that emerged in the data. All study participants were
female executives employed in organizations in Nashville,
Tennessee, during the 2 years leading up to the study.
Data Sources, Evidence, Objectives, or
Materials
This study used purposeful and snowball sampling of female
executives in the greater Nashville, Tennessee area.
Participants were recruited through email, in person, and over
4 SAGE Open
the phone and were invited to participate in in-depth inter-
views or focus groups to share personal, lived experiences
with career planning and advancement in organizations.
Sixty-two women were invited to participate in this study.
Sixteen agreed to participate; 10 participated in in-depth
interviews and 6 participated in focus group interviews. The
10 in-depth interviews and 2 focus groups that resulted in the
collection of data for this study were held in classrooms on
University of Phoenix campuses in Nashville, Tennessee,
and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In-depth interviews and focus
groups were conducted to the point of data saturation.
Standardized interview protocols were developed and
peer reviewed prior to the study. The protocols were used in
all in-depth interviews and focus group interviews to ensure
that study participants in each session were provided with an
opportunity to respond to an identical set of questions.
Demographic and work history questionnaires were used to
collect demographic data such as age bracket, marital status,
education level, and work history detail including industry,
size of current organization, and years of experience in exec-
utive positions. The researcher conducted the interviews fol-
lowing the in-depth interview and focus group protocol.
The in-depth interview protocol was designed to mitigate
the potential for subjectivity and bias in individual interview
settings and guided each in-depth interview. In-depth inter-
view questions were developed to provide data that may be
helpful to answering the research questions identified for this
study. Questions were developed to ensure open-ended
answers describing participants'perceptions and experiences
with the phenomenon under study. Questions were devel-
oped in alignment with the research questions and to guide
the interview process. In-depth interview questions were
designed to gather data rich descriptions of female execu-
tives' lived experiences, beliefs, and perceptions relevant to
career planning and advancement in organizations.
Validation of study protocol and data collection tools is
recommended to ensure adequate design for eliciting data
rich responses from the study subjects. Pilot interviews and
focus groups are effective tools for validating study protocol
(Leedy & Ormrod, 2010; Salkind, 2003). Expert review of
study protocol and demographics and work history profile
questionnaires ensured credibility and consistency in data
collection. The expert was a senior director of human
resources for a medium sized firm and possessed extensive
experience with qualitative research, focus groups, and the
development and validation of focus group protocol.
To evaluate the clarity of in-depth interview questions and
the effectiveness of the interview protocol, a pilot study took
place prior to the actual study. A pilot study is an effective
way of validating study protocol (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010;
Salkind, 2003). No questions were changed prior to conduct-
ing the actual in-depth interviews for this study. The pilot
in-depth interview participant did not participate in the actual
study. The pilot study revealed that the in-depth interview
questions were clear and concise and elicited open-ended
answers sufficient to collect data capable of answering the
research questions posed for this study. No changes were
made to the in-depth interview protocol based on the results
of the pilot in-depth interview.
The focus group protocol listed the predetermined ques-
tions that were applied in each focus group interview.
Questions were developed before the focus group pilot inter-
view based on themes identified in the analysis of data col-
lected from in-depth interviews. The themes identified
dictated the selection of the topics discussed and the format
of focus group interview questions. Focus group questions
were developed to provide data that may be helpful to
answering the research questions identified for this study and
relevant to verifying themes identified in analysis of in-depth
interview data. Questions were developed to guide the focus
group interviews, ensure open-ended answers in alignment
with the research questions, and facilitate candid discussion
among focus group participants. One pilot focus group was
conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of the focus group
and to ensure the clarity of interview questions. Based on
feedback from the pilot focus group members, one question
was modified. Participants from the pilot study did not par-
ticipate in the actual study.
The demographics and work history profile were designed
to gather demographic and work history details relevant to
describing the sample relevant to this study. Work history
and demographic data made it possible to identify and
describe characteristics of the participants, the organizations,
and the industries represented by the study sample. All study
participants were asked to sign a signed consent form, were
advised of their right to withdraw from the study at any time
without any repercussions, were assured of confidentiality,
and were assigned pseudonyms to ensure protection of pri-
vacy. The in-depth interview protocol, focus group protocol,
and demographics and work history profile were reviewed
by the International Review Board (IRB) to ensure adequate
consideration for participant privacy, anonymity, and
confidentiality.
Results and Point of View
Akey finding of this study was that gender bias was the prev-
alent challenge experienced by women when applying career
planning and advancement in organizations. Barriers to
advancement for women in organizations were identified by
Catalyst (2007), Sabattini (2008), and Warren (2009) as the
double-bind, the unwritten rules to advancement, and cas-
cading gender bias. These three barriers were also identified
as obstacles women face as they pursue advancement to
executive levels in organizations. Although the unwritten
rules to advancement apply to all employees, networking and
access to mentors were two of the unwritten rules identified
as unwritten rules that can represent seemingly insurmount-
able barriers for women in male dominated environments
(Herminia, 1992; Raggins & Cotton, 1991, 1999; Sabattini,
Schulz and Enslin 5
2008). Because women perceive a significant disadvantage
in overcoming unwritten rules to networking (especially out-
side working hours) and gaining access to mentors (Raggins
& Cotton, 1999), the unwritten rules to advancement were
identified as gender specific challenges for the purpose of
this study.
Experiences With the Double-Bind
Female executives who participated in this study shared per-
ceptions and experiences with the double-bind, which was
described by Catalyst (2007) as a set of conflicting demands
that earns women a label of either too nice or too brash,
requires women to work harder than male counterparts for
the same or less reward and recognition, and creates a need
for women to prove themselves capable and worthy of each
opportunity, often doing the job long before receiving the
formal promotion, whereas male counterparts are given
opportunities and promoted based on potential rather than
proven performance.
Cheryl explained her perceptions of the double-bind as a
hurdle for women pursuing career planning and advance-
ment in organizations when she stated,
A female needs to be worried, much more, about the respect
level around her than the like level. That's something a female
needs to come to terms with. I think sometimes we are wired a
little different, but when you get to that place, and accept that,
you become a stronger leader.
Another participant shared concerns about gender bias in
the workplace: "I'm in a very male dominated environment.
Very male dominated. Very few women [organization name
omitted], in my department, and at my level and above. So,
again, you've gotta make sure you can hang in the meeting."
She went on to say, "I feel like women almost have to try a
little harder because there's an expectation that they're not
going to be as business minded, if you will, as men. So it's a
little bit harder to work."
One focus group participant commented on the need for
women to vocalize their advancement desires because many
managers assume women are not as career driven as men:
It does seem to be with men. It's almost just assumed, well of
course they wanna advance. With women . . . I don't know. And
so, I think it's really really important for women to make it
clear--you know--just to have an idea what else they want to
do and try to be working and growing themselves to get there all
the time.
A fellow focus group participant spoke up, vocalizing
concerns about the double standard often faced by women
who advocate for themselves. "Yes," she agreed, "And not in
a bitchy way, because when we speak up we're bitches, but
when men speak up they're just being assertive."
Pat described how gender bias could work against both
male and female employees in low- and mid-level
environments dominated by either gender. Pat pointed out
that low-level males trying to build careers in female domi-
nated industries such as health care may face more gender
bias than women in the same roles, but observed that women
may still be challenged by gender bias in pursuit of advance-
ment to executive levels even in traditionally feminine indus-
tries. She stated,
Well, I think not only for women but since we're talking about
women, it's extremely important for women to have the degrees,
to have the certifications, and to have the experience that they
need. And sometimes, I find . . . that there is sort of a bias. You
know, in nursing the bias is more toward men coming into those
positions versus females, because it's generally a female career.
You know, that's really the majority of people in those positions.
In other positions, though, I think--depending on what it is--
sometimes females are at a disadvantage because they are female.
In summary, data collected and analyzed for this study
revealed evidence of female executive's experiences with the
double-bind and supported the evidence of gender bias pres-
ent in the three predicaments of the double-bind as presented
by Catalyst (2007).
Experiences With the Unwritten Rules to
Advancement
Female executives who participated in this study emphasized
the importance of individual commitment to career planning,
and the responsibility for women to take ownership for pur-
suing career goals. Diane, a CEO with 20 years executive
level experience in organizations, emphasized the necessity
for personal ownership in career planning and advancement,
and the benefit of self-awareness gained through career plan-
ning: "I think if we're aware of ourselves and of the opportu-
nities, I really think there's power in that. And it's up to us to
take advantage of that knowledge." Another participant,
Brenda, advised junior women to "Do it! Number one, I
mean, you just gotta do it! And it's got to be YOU."
Another participant explained how awareness of self and
surroundings helped her manage her career through a volatile
and uncertain time:
Changes were happening. The changes that were happening
were out of my control, so how could I be more in control of
what I could control? And that's only the . . . you know . . . just
me. And how could I make my skills better or more marketable
so if I did get cut, you know, that my next opportunity--that I'd
be a better-prepared candidate.
Another participant said that women were responsible for
taking action to manage the trajectory of their own career
whenever possible. "You have to innovate," she said. She
went on to explain how inequity in her work environment
and a perceived need for change motivated her to develop
and champion for the creation of a new position that resulted
in her promotion to executive level:
6 SAGE Open
When I was a director of sales I had three counterparts. Four of
us were covering the whole country, and I was so much more
effective and better at my position than the other three. Yet, I
found out they were being paid more than me. They were three
men, and I was the only female. That crawled all over me. So
that's when I created the executive director level, sold it [to
senior management], and then I was promoted to executive
director.
Although every woman may not be in a position to create
her own executive level position, a career plan is powerless
without action. Erica precisely summed this up when she
declared, "I think that what a woman actually does plays a
larger role than the actual career planning."
Female executives who participated in this study described
networking and building relationships with peers, mentors,
and advocates as important factors in the lived experiences
with career planning and advancement in organizations. One
stated,
Women need to have strong supporters and strong sponsors
within their organizations to help them move up. And we, as
women, have a duty and an obligation. We just had a legal
education thing on this the other day--lifting as we climb. We
need to remember that there are people above us, women above
us, who lifted us and we need to lift the people behind us. And I
believe career planning is such a big part of that. We need to talk
to the younger women that we see in our organizations about
thinking about career planning, about being deliberate in the
choices that you make.
Another said,
I heard somebody put it in terms of having a personal advisory
board. Those people in your life that you can go and talk to and
say, "I need to talk to you about my career," or "I need to talk to
you about finances," or "I need to see how you handled this
situation." And having those people that you trust to keep your
confidences and you also trust to be brutally honest.
In summary, in-depth interview and focus group partici-
pants for this study described experiences with the unwritten
rules to advancement, specifically those rules related to
career planning and to finding mentors and advocates who
provide support and act as champions.
Experiences With Cascading Gender Bias
The basic principle behind cascading gender bias is that
senior leaders, the majority of whom are male, consciously
or subconsciously apply masculine assumptions to evaluate
leadership potential and capabilities for the purposes of hir-
ing, promoting, and succession planning (Warren, 2009).
Female executives who participated in this study described
experiences and observations related to cascading gender
bias.
Cascading gender bias was evident in one participant's
reference to the old boys club. "I think women work harder
than men," the female executive stated. "There are the old
boys' clubs. And they are there, and they are prevalent." The
participant paused a moment and then went on to say, "I
don't think they are wrong. I'm not calloused by it. It's just
. . . where do I fit in?"
When asked to describe the nature of the relationship
between career planning and the advancement of women in
organizations, another in-depth interview participant stated,
"It really depends on leadership, in my opinion. It is a top-
down perspective. If you work in an organization where
women are seen as valuable in leadership roles then I think
those things trickle down." The female executive went on to
say, "In different years, in the company that I'm at, there
have been ten women in top leadership positions. In other
years, there have been two. It really just depends on who was
president and CEO at the time."
And yet another female executive described cascading
gender bias as a hurdle to career planning and advancement
in organizations when she said,
I have faced hurdles. I have worked in environments where it
was very difficult for women to advance, largely because the
leadership roles were filled with men who were looking to
promote other men and not females. I have left those
environments in order to continue to move up, realizing there
were no opportunities.
In summary, female executives who participated in this
study shared observations and experiences in support of
Warren's (2009) assertions that cascading gender bias influ-
ences and often dictates who gets recruited, hired, and pro-
moted in an organization.
Summary: Results and Point of View
Gender bias was the prevalent challenge to career planning
and advancement in organizations as described by female
executives who participated in this study. Evidence of the
double-bind, the unwritten rules to advancement, and cas-
cading gender bias was evident in the data collected in 10
in-depth interviews and 2 focus group interviews involving 3
female executives each. Participants described how career
planning and engaging the support of mentors and advocates
played a significant role in their advancement to executive
level leadership, which supports past research indicating that
career planning may help women overcome obstacles to
advancement in organizations (Sabattini, 2008; Sabattini &
Dinolfo, 2010; Warren, 2009).
Recommendations
The findings of this study may help organizational leaders
develop appropriate models and programs to address career
planning and advancement and increase the potential for hir-
ing and promoting the best person for the job regardless of
gender. Women who desire advancement in organizations
Schulz and Enslin 7
must take the initiative to engage in career planning follow
through on the resulting career plan. Women must recognize
that successful career planning and advancement in organi-
zations are dependent on people beyond the individual doing
the career planning and seek support from peers, mentors,
advisors, and advocates who can positively contribute to
their success. Female executives must take responsibility for
informing and educating junior women about the unwritten
rules for advancement and encourage women, minorities,
and men to engage in career planning early and often in their
careers. Organizational leaders and human resource manage-
ment professionals must develop and implement mentor pro-
grams that ensure women gain access and support from
mentors at executive levels. Females who seek career
advancement must make networking a priority and create
visibility for themselves inside and outside their current
organizations.
Women in organizations must find the confidence and
strength to openly discuss gender bias as it presents itself in
the workplace, and organizational leaders must implement
policies and practices to ensure female workers can voice
concerns without fear of retribution or negative implications
for future advancement. Educational leaders must encourage
career planning, in a broad sense, during the first 2 years of
college and provide students with tools, information, and
training necessary to develop a solid foundation for lifelong
career planning. Women must take advantage of the tools
provided by educational institutions and should seek support
for career planning after graduating from college. Likewise,
organizations must help women continue efforts toward
career planning by offering self-assessment tools, access to
mentors, training and development opportunities, and
insights into career paths and potential advancement oppor-
tunities within the organization. Women who desire advance-
ment to executive levels in organizations must engage in
career planning activities that enhance self-awareness;
increase visibility into development and advancement oppor-
tunities; facilitate networking; and establish mentoring rela-
tionships with individuals who can provide advice, coaching,
and support.
Organizations must promote the formal career planning
programs, development programs, and tools available within
the organization to make it more likely that employees will
become aware of and engage in career planning.
Organizational leaders must empower human resource man-
agement teams to design and implement comprehensive
career planning and advancement programs that inform and
empower managers by making it possible to more efficiently
and effectively match employees to development and
advancement opportunities. Organizational leaders must
provide managers and human resource departments with the
necessary resources for successfully implementing and
maintaining career planning and advancement programs.
Finally, the findings of this study inspired the development
of the comprehensive organizational career planning model,
which can be applied for women, men, and minorities in
organizations (Figure 1).
Although the comprehensive career planning model
developed for this study has not been tested, the model was
developed by the researcher to address the need for career-
planning support in organizations and incorporates the find-
ings of this study. The model demonstrates a perpetual
process for development, feedback, reflection, and learning
that has a strong foundation of continuous organizational
support. Investments in organizational development pro-
grams that address all elements of the comprehensive organi-
zational career planning model would benefit individuals
and organizations by cultivating employee engagement,
increasing job satisfaction, providing visibility into opportu-
nities for advancement, increasing employee retention,
reducing turnover costs, increasing productivity, and enhanc-
ing visibility and insight for succession planning.
Limitations
The limitations of the study included population size and
geographic area, which make it impossible to generalize the
results across the broader population. Other limitations
include self-reporting by study participants and researcher as
interviewer, which may have introduced bias. Participant
responses may have been consciously or subconsciously
influenced through nonverbal cues or tone and manner in
which the interviewer asked questions. Although research
protocol was examined by experts prior to pilot studies to
mitigate the potential for bias in interview questions and
focus groups were used to provide validation through trian-
gulation, a researcher's engagement in the process may
introduce bias and affect results. Researcher bias was also
possible in the interpretation of results.
Conclusion
The findings of this study have implications for individual
career management, employee retention and productivity,
and for closing the gender-gap in organizational leadership.
Career planning can empower women, men, and minorities
to seek out and pursue development and advancement
opporutnities. Engaging employees in organizatioanl career
planning programs and supporting career planning efforts
may serve to increase employee retention and boost employee
loyalty, while serving to close the leadership gap at senior
levels in the orgnaization. Engaging highly motivated
employees in career planning and advancement programs
may also serve to better ensure that the best person is chosen
for the job regardless of gender.
The findings in this study are significant for providing
managers and organizational leaders with additional insights
into the benefits for organizations and the benefits and barri-
ers for women with regard to career planning and advance-
ment in organizations. The findings may help policy makers
8 SAGE Open
and organizational leaders design future models and pro-
grams to aide with career planning and advancement in orga-
nizations and for creating organizational cultures and
structures that are increasingly gender-neutral. These find-
ings may also provide organizational leaders with additional
information about the factors influencing the lived experi-
ence of female employees with career planning and advance-
ment in organizations, and help educational institutions
develop programs and tools that help students develop
awareness for the importance of career planning to
advancement.
Future research may include repeating the research
design, method, process, and protocol in other geographic
areas of the United States to further explore the lived experi-
ences of female executives with career planning or to inves-
tigate the lived experiences of male executives with career
planning and advancement. Recommended future research
would also investigate the emotional and experiential impli-
cations for women who verbalize concerns about gender bias
and gender inequality in organizational systems. Finally,
future research should be conducted to explore the implica-
tions of incorporating the comprehensive career planning
