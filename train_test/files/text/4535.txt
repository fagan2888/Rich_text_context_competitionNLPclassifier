Article
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disability that
influences an individual's social, communication, and behav-
ioral interactions and can cause difficulties in educational
development and skill acquisition (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013). Although ASD can be identified as early
as 2 years of age (Corsello, Akshoomoff, & Stahmer, 2013),
it is often only identified once children enter the education
system (Aspect, 2013b).
The reported prevalence of ASD within the community
continues to rise. In England, researchers estimate that there
are approximately 1 in 100 people in the population who are
diagnosed with ASD (Brugha et al., 2011). In 2014, however,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indi-
cated a much higher community incidence when they
reported an estimated prevalence of 1 in 68 8-year-old chil-
dren are diagnosed with ASD--a 123% increase in the prev-
alence of ASD since 2002 (Autism and Developmental
Disabilities Monitoring Network, 2014).
In Australia, data provided by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics show that in 2012, there were 115,000 Australians
living with ASD (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014), and
that almost 81,200 were school-aged children (5-19 years).
Of these children, 95% are reported to need specialized edu-
cation to support their communication, social, or learning dif-
ficulties (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014). Recent
research has also suggested that the majority of these students
are enrolled in mainstream schools and are not participating
in specialized intervention programs (Aspect, 2013b).
A diagnosis of ASD can provide an opportunity for par-
ents and therapists to implement evidence-based early inter-
vention programs such as speech pathology (Burgess &
Turkstra, 2010; van der Meer & Rispoli, 2010), occupational
therapy (Ashburner, Ziviani, & Rodger, 2010), psychologi-
cal interventions (van der Meer & Weijers, 2013), and behav-
ior modification programs (Stock, Mirends, & Smith, 2013),
and much of this research is concentrated on programs and
support mechanisms appropriate for pre-school-aged chil-
dren (Eapen, Crncec, & Walter, 2013; Warren et al., 2011).
There is, however, limited peer-reviewed research available
for evaluating school-based interventions (Detrich & Lewis,
2013; Dingfelder, 2011; Kasari & Smith, 2013; Parsons et
al., 2013), and this has left the ASD school education com-
munity with a shortage of rigorously assessed programs to
implement in the classroom (Parsons et al., 2013).
A growing interest in the gap between research and ASD
classroom practice has become a key topic of discussion.

The Autism Spectrum Disorder
Evaluative Education Model: A
School-Based Method of Assessing and
Selecting Interventions for Classroom Use
Debra Costley1, Trevor Clark1, and Susan Bruck1
Abstract
Evaluating educational programs and interventions is generally considered a normal part of curriculum development and
improvement, and published findings are readily accessible through peer-reviewed journals. Recently, however, researchers
and practicing educators have identified a lack of evaluative research regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) educational
practices in the peer-reviewed literature. Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect) has an established evidence-informed ASD
curriculum that is constantly reviewed and updated to meet the needs of the students in Aspect schools and classes. Through
a methodical evaluative process, all educational interventions and support processes and devices undergo a series of Evidence-
Based Research Trials and evaluations before they are implemented in classes. This article demonstrates how a workflow
model can deliver a systematic method for identifying, evaluating, implementing, and disseminating the research findings of a
program or support intervention. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Evaluative Education (ASDEE) model is discussed.

This gap has been attributed to the lack of readily available
evidence-based research about genuine classroom interven-
tions (Kasari & Smith, 2013; Kratochwill, 2007; Pellicano,
Dinsmore, & Charman, 2013; Stephenson, Carter, & Kemp,
2012) and ASD school curricula (Clark, 2013).
Recently, Wong et al. (2014) published an extensive
review of evidence-based practices for people with ASD.
This review evaluated more than 450 journal articles that
reported intervention practices that addressed a single educa-
tional goal with the aim of identifying practices that encour-
age improved individual educational, behavioral, or
developmental outcomes. The majority of the participants in
these studies were aged between 3 and 11 years. A total of 58
studies investigated students'performance on tasks that typi-
cally occur at schools.
Despite the breadth of studies examined in Wong et al.
(2014), 90% of the reports reviewed investigated individual
case studies and only 10% were based on studies of two
(Harper, Symon, & Frea, 2008; Kuhn, Bodkin, Devlin, &
Doggett, 2008) or four children (Laushey, Heflin, Shippen,
Alberto, & Fredrick, 2009). The findings from this meta-
analysis suggest that although educational ASD interven-
tions are being evaluated and reported, there is a need for
larger scale evaluations.
Appropriately evaluated ASD curriculums have been
demonstrated to assist in supporting learning outcomes
(Costley, Keane, Clark, & Lane, 2012; National Autism
Center, 2011) and are documented as a priority for education
providers (New South Wales [NSW] Department of
Education and Communities, 2011; Simpson, McKee, Teeter,
& Beytien, 2007). In 2013, theAustralian Government estab-
lished a National Cooperative Research Centre to research
the needs of people living with ASD, and one of the specific
goals of the program is to "provide appropriate educational
environments and programs to optimise students' social,
behavioural and academic success, and equip teachers to
manage even the most complex behaviours" (Autism
Cooperative Research Centre, 2014).
Aspect is an Australian ASD service provider of educa-
tional services, diagnostic assessments, early intervention and
outreach programs as well as professional development. It fea-
tures an ASD-specific school program and delivers an evi-
dence-informed curriculum to more than 1,000 enrolled
students. Aspect has a network of eight independent schools
and more than 100 satellite classes embedded in mainstream
schools across the Australian State of NSW. Programs and
interventions are scrutinized through a process of evidence-
based research, peer- and self-reviewed evaluation, and a con-
tinuous improvement program cycle (Aspect, 2013a, 2013b;
Costley et al., 2012; Keane,Aldridge, Costley, & Clark, 2012).
Evidence-based research provides scientific verification
of the effectiveness or lack of significant change in outcomes
as a result of an intervention. In education, however, a statis-
tically significant basis for implementing a process or sup-
port may not be the whole story. In cases where evaluation
by collegial educators, support networks, and other stake-
holders identifies student benefits from an intervention, a
method of evidence-informed decision making can be valu-
able (Ciliska, Thomas, & Buffet, 2012). Evidence-informed
appraisal has the benefit that it can integrate scientific evi-
dence with informed community opinions (Kohatsu,
Robinson, & Torner, 2004).
Aspect uses an evidence-informed program selection pro-
cess that assesses new products and programs to determine
whether an intervention will be included or excluded from
the curriculum. The Aspect model of evaluation uses both
evidence-based and evidence-informed research to assess the
internal validity of a program, that is, to measure the effi-
cacy. Evidence-informed assessment also provides a process
for bridging the gap between the practitioner's assessment
and classroom practice through external validation by using
available resources and translating the suggestions into
empirical research (Mercer, DeVinney, Fine, Green, &
Dougherty, 2007).
According to the U.S. National Research Council (2001),
the education of teachers and school personnel is the pri-
mary way of encouraging evidence-based teaching strate-
gies. Researchers suggest that the critical element for
translating research into practice is to ensure that there is a
high fidelity implementation through a system of regular
program review by teachers (Mandell et al., 2013) and
through ongoing training for paraprofessionals within
schools (Brock & Carter, 2013). An example of a resource
that has been developed specifically to encourage practitio-
ners to take a scientific approach to selecting ASD-specific
interventions is the Autism Research Toolkit (White,
Leekham, Shenow, & Gomez de la Cuesta, 2013). This
resource suggests that intervention programs implement a
research cycle to "predict, test, observe, and explore" the
impact of an intervention as a way of evaluating the efficacy
of an educational program.
At Aspect, the primary objective is to develop an evi-
dence-informed ASD-specific curriculum that validates the
teaching and intervention methods used in the schools and
classes. A comprehensive evidence-based review conducted
at Aspect identified several educational program elements
that were essential to a school program designed to support
learning and encourage transition to a more inclusive educa-
tional setting. This specialized curriculum is designed by
Aspect and based on the literature that focuses on individual
student education plans that are designed to evaluate and
monitor the pupil's core competencies and their outcomes
based on their support needs (Iovannone, Dunlap, Huber, &
Kincaid, 2003).
In 2011, a multi-site action research project began to doc-
ument the information, processes, and procedures used
within Aspect schools. The goal was to collect data that
showed how the Aspect Comprehensive Approach for
Education (ACAE) framework was implemented in the
schools. As a result of this process, the ACAE manual was
Costley et al. 3
developed, which provides a comprehensive description on
an evidence-based curriculum for teaching children with
ASD (Aspect, 2012). The ACAE manual provides a blue
print for how each element of the ACAE should be imple-
mented in the Aspect schools. Each section of the ACAE
manual provides the theory and current research supporting
the curriculum methodology, how to implement the method-
ology in classroom practice, case studies, lesson templates,
and resources. The manual includes a Self-Review Checklist
for examining program fidelity as part of a Continuous
Improvement Project cycle.
AtAspect, a workflow model has been developed with the
aim of providing staff with an easily understandable template
for conducting educational evaluations. A workflow model is
a visual representation that identifies the procedures of a
defined project. Workflow models can characterize how
tasks are undertaken with respect to an organization's poli-
cies and specific objectives (Alhaqbani, Adams, Fidge, & ter
Hofstede, 2013). From an educational perspective, a work-
flow model can be used to define the research question,
describe the sequence of the research evaluation and imple-
mentation stages, and identify the educational outcomes and
community benefits. A workflow model can provide schools
with a consistent system for identifying new educational
support devices and strategies, and allow for focus on the
reliable and valid assessment of student outcomes in authen-
tic educational environments.
The goal of this article is to describe the Autism Spectrum
Disorder Evaluative Education (ASDEE) model and to dem-
onstrate how Aspect manages a process of research into new
ASD-specific education interventions.
The ASDEE Model
The ASDEE model shows the flow of the decision-making
process for implementing new interventions and supports
within the curriculum. The ASDEE model is an overview of
the procedures for identifying, piloting, evaluating, and
implementing ASD-specific educational programs and class-
room supports. It also depicts how evidence-based outcomes
are professionally disseminated. Figure 1 depicts the process
developed by Aspect to support and evaluate the ACAE
curriculum.
When new support devices and technologies become
available, parents often ask teachers to implement particular
interventions in the classroom, but it can be difficult for teach-
ers to identify which support is likely to benefit the student.
One recent example is the Apple iPad (iPad is a trademark of
Apple Inc.), which is marketed as a device designed with
assistive features for students with special needs, including
assistive touch, speech to text features, gesture-based screen
readers, and opportunities for reducing the visual clutter on
screens (Apple, 2014). There are numerous applications
designed and marketed as providing communication, behav-
ioral, or learning support for individuals with ASD.
In response to the questions from parents and teachers,
Aspect conducted a research trial on iPad use in Aspect
classrooms (Aspect, 2013a). We will use this example to
demonstrate how Aspect evaluated the efficacy of a new
intervention for potential inclusion in the ACAE manual.
The ASDEE model is divided into two phases: Evaluation
and Practice. The Evaluation phase of the ASDEE model
includes the assessment and decision-making process under-
taken before an educational intervention is implemented.
Following a positive evaluation outcome, the educational inter-
vention is implemented within Aspect schools and the findings
disseminated. This implementation and dissemination process
is shown in the ASDEE model as the Practice phase.
New Support Device or Intervention
Identified
The ASDEE model begins with the identification of an inno-
vation that is suggested to be a promising educational sup-
port for students (see Figure 1), as a New Support Device or
Intervention Identified. The evidence-informed process
begins here and establishes the research problem by identify-
ing a program, support device, or intervention that has the
potential to provide an improved educational outcome for
students with ASD.
For example, when the iPad was first released, several par-
ents approached theAspect school teachers with the suggestion
that these new devices be used in class because they believed
that the iPad could provide substantial support to their child's
learning. Aspect considered the parents'request and decided to
conduct an evidence-informed Small Pilot Study.
Literature Review
The peer-reviewed literature search provides the opportunity
for relevant, reliable, and valid studies to be evaluated. This
process is the first stage in the evaluation of the
intervention.
The literature review is conducted by reviewing relevant
literature, including peer-reviewed journal articles sourced
through Google Scholar and EBSCO databases. This review
also examines "grey literature," which includes published
material from technical reports, specialist professional publi-
cations, and manufacturers' or developers' websites.
The criteria for inclusion in the literature review will
depend on the educational support to be evaluated. The
objective of the literature review is to define the research
question and identify who will benefit from the intervention
(e.g., students with limited communication skills). Material
is included in the literature review if the published outcomes
are measureable.
For example, in 2010, after the release of the iPad, stu-
dents at Aspect schools began to bring the devices into the
classroom. Parents noted that their children demonstrated
improvements in a variety of skills when using the device.

This raised many questions about the children's engagement
in learning activities and whether the benefits were measur-
able. By 2011, reviews, commentary, and case study reports
of how iPads could be used in education started to appear
(Geist, 2011; Hutchison, Beschorner, & Schmidt-Crawford,
2012; Oakley, Howitt, Garwood, & Durack, 2013). However,
missing from the iPad reports was the rigorous pedagogi-
cally founded evidence-based research. Therefore, we con-
ducted a review of relevant literature regarding the use of the
iPad with students with ASD.
The literature review for the iPad study was conducted by
running a search through Google Scholar and EBSCO data-
bases using the following search words: autism, iPad, educa-
tion, learning, and teach. In addition to the peer-reviewed
literature, relevant "grey literature" including teacher educa-
tion conference presentations and proceedings were gathered
and appraised.
Evaluation of Evidence
After a literature review is conducted, the evidence is evalu-
ated by a team of Aspect teachers and researchers. The pur-
pose of the evaluation is to decide whether sufficient evidence
exists to support further exploration of the use of the inter-
vention at Aspect. During the evaluation of evidence pro-
cess, two possible outcomes are examined: evidence
informed and evidence based.
Evidence-Informed Outcome
In cases where peer-reviewed literature does not yet exist but
anecdotal evidence is convincing, Aspect encourages a pro-
cess of evidence-informed decision making with regard to
trialling new interventions. The process of evidence-
informed research recognizes that large-scale, randomized
control studies are not necessarily the most appropriate
method of evaluating every intervention. This is especially
true for research into educational interventions for individu-
als with ASD as their requirements can be very individual-
ized, and standardized measurements may not reflect the
tolerance levels required for evaluative comparison
(Charman et al., 2003; Lord et al., 2005; Odom, Boyd, Hall,
& Hume, 2010).
An intervention can earn evidence-informed status when
there is evidence from reliable sources such as professional
conferences, expert implementers, and/or teachers, occupa-
tional therapists, and parents who may have observed
improvements after trialling a new support or intervention. If
the intervention meets the criteria for evidence-informed sta-
tus, the decision can be made to conduct a research project
and submit a Research and Ethics Application. In the exam-
ple of the iPad evaluation, the peer-reviewed literature sug-
gested that this device had the potential to provide social and
academic benefits (Alexander, Ayres, Smith, Shepley, &
Mataras, 2013; Burton, Anderson, Prater, & Dyches, 2013).
In addition, a teacher education conference presentation one
of the Aspect teachers attended also demonstrated evidence
of using the iPad as a communication tool that could facili-
tate routine classroom activities for students with cognitive
impairment (Conley, 2012).
Evidence-Based Outcome
This decision underlines the ACAE principles that a compre-
hensive ASD-specialized program includes a variety of edu-
cational approaches designed to meet the range of individual
needs of all students at all times (Australian Advisory Board
on Autism Spectrum Disorders, 2010). The ACAE acknowl-
edges that within a set of standard procedures and core cur-
riculum, different teaching tools, interventions, and
techniques may be used at different times during a child's
development. If the evidence meets the criteria of the ACAE
curriculum, the evaluation can proceed to the Research and
Ethics Application and approval process. To meet the criteria
of the ACAE curriculum, the program must meet the require-
ments of the syllabus regulator, the Board of Studies NSW,
Australia; show evidence of significant outcome benefits as
determined by the student's individual educational plan; and
be affordable within the school budget, as assessed by the
senior educational management team.
In the situation where there is no clear evidence that meets
the ACAE criteria, the evaluation process is discontinued
and no further investigation takes place. When there is sub-
stantiated peer-reviewed evidence of improved outcomes,
ASD specific or not, a valid assessment of the intervention
can lead to the decision to progress to the Research and
Ethics Application and approval process for clearance to trial
and evaluate an intervention. After the Small Pilot Study
shows positive outcomes for the students involved, an
Evidence-Based Research Trial can be designed and con-
ducted in two classes in each of three Aspect schools over a
period of 1 year.
Research and Ethics Application and
Approval Process
All research conducted at Aspect requires ethics clearance
prior to commencing a research study with students, staff,
or clients. The ethics approval process ensures that research
is appropriately conducted and that the welfare, rights, dig-
nity, and safety of participants are protected. The process of
applying for ethics clearance not only provides an opportu-
nity for the application assessors to evaluate methodologi-
cal rigor and scrutinize potential risks and benefits to
participants, but it also ensures that the researcher consid-
ers and manages any risks and benefits associated with the
study while developing the research methodology. The
application process also provides an opportunity for the
researcher to outline the study's contribution to the wider
ASD community.
6 SAGE Open
The Research and Ethics Application and approval pro-
cess is applicable to the Evidence-Based Research Trials,
Small Pilot Studies, and Continuous Improvement Projects.
The process is clearly mapped with application forms easily
accessible through the Aspect intranet and Internet website.
The Research and Ethics Application requires details about
the research questions, methodology, risks/benefits analysis,
and expected outcomes. Small Pilot Studies and Continuous
Improvement Projects are assessed by the Aspect Research
Approvals Committee, which is made up of a team of expe-
rienced human research ethics advisors. Research approval is
generally granted for 1 year.
The ASDEE model shows the flow of direction from the
Research and Ethics Application process to the research
studies options--Evidence-Based Research Trial, Small
Pilot Study, or Continuous Improvement Project.
Evidence of Efficacy
The aim of conducting research at Aspect is to provide rele-
vant improvements in educational processes and outcomes
for students. Small-scale study evaluations with valid and
reliable methodology provide an opportunity to assess the
efficacy of an intervention. Evidence of efficacy can be
explored by conducting a small research project. At Aspect,
there are two options: the Continuous Improvement Project
and the Small Pilot Study. Often, Continuous Improvement
Projects or Small Pilot Study research studies are conducted
prior to Evidence-Based Research Trials.
The first option is the Continuous Improvement Project.
The purpose of the Continuous Improvement Project at
Aspect is to improve service provision and to annually moni-
tor compliance with national and state curricula require-
ments. They are conducted each year on a selection of
programs that are identified by the school managers. Each
Continuous Improvement Project runs over 1 school year.
The Continuous Improvement Project requires ethics and
research clearance from the Aspect Research Approvals
Committee before commencement as well as signed informed
consent from participants or parents/guardians on behalf of
student participants. The Continuous Improvement Project is
designed for small, short-term studies and is usually a one-
off or pre-/post-program questionnaire about the effective-
ness of an intervention and may be directed to parents,
teachers, or students. Findings from a Continuous
Improvement Project can only be distributed internally
within Aspect. At the end of the Continuous Improvement
Project, a participant-de-identified written report is prepared
by the evaluator/s. The findings are reported to Aspect man-
agers and executives, shared with teaching staff across the
organization, and are used to improve practice.
The other option is the Small Pilot Study, in which an
intervention is evaluated and results can be publicly dissemi-
nated. The Small Pilot Study is designed as a research project
with rigorous methodology. The Small Pilot Study may be
undertaken as a trial and may have peer-reviewed evidence-
based support or anecdotal indication of an evidence-
informed practice.
As a result of the collation of some evidence-informed
material and evidence-based iPad literature (Geist, 2011;
Rayner, 2010), a Small Pilot Study was developed to test
whether there was evidence of improved educational out-
comes for children with ASD. Aspect worked in partnership
with researchers from the University of Wollongong who
supported additional data collection, analysis, and reporting.
In all, 33 students aged between 5 and 7 years participated in
a study that evaluated communication, behavior, and social
skills development after using appropriate iPad applications
for 1 full school year. In this study, the teacher evaluated the
student's baseline measures at the beginning of the school
year and again at the end of the school year. The encouraging
results from the Small Pilot Study enabled further investiga-
tion into the iPad as an educational tool through an Evidence-
Based Research Trial.
In the ASDEE model, when outcomes from the Small
Pilot Studies provide evidence of efficacy, the decision to
move to an Evidence-Based Research Trial can be under-
taken. If after the Small Pilot Study there is no evidence of an
improved outcome, then the intervention is not implemented
at Aspect schools.
Evidence-Based Research Trial
The Evidence-Based Research Trial is larger in scope than
the Continuous Improvement Project and the Small Pilot
Study. The participant-de-identified findings from these
projects may be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal
articles, conference presentations, conference proceedings,
workshops, fact sheets, the Aspect Model Class Program,
and other media sources. The findings from the Evidence-
Based Research Trial are also used to review and revise the
ACAE and accompanying manual. Evidence-Based Research
Trials are conducted over the course of 1 school year. The
trials are piloted in up to five schools, with each school con-
ducting the program in two or three classes. Evidence-Based
Research Trials are granted ethics approval from an indepen-
dent accredited Australian University Human Research Ethic
Committee as part of the evaluation process.
Once the intervention has been evaluated and the out-
comes reported to the Education and Research Committee, a
decision is made as to whether the intervention will be incor-
porated into the ACAE manual. This decision to include an
intervention in the ACAE manual is dependent upon evi-
dence of a significant benefit to the student, budgetary con-
siderations, and how it complies with government educational
curriculum requirements.
In the iPad study, an Evidence-Based Research Trial was
conducted and piloted in three schools. The results from the
trial have been disseminated through Aspect's professional
development workshops, and journal articles are currently
Costley et al. 7
under peer-review. The iPad Model Class Program is suc-
cessfully running in one school and the program is incorpo-
rated into the ACAE manual and implemented in Aspect
classrooms across the school network.
ACAE Manual
The Continuous Improvement Project, Evidence-Based
Research Trial, and Self-Review Checklist findings are col-
lated annually and contribute to the ACAE manual. The aim
of the ACAE manual is to provide Aspect educators and the
wider community with an evidence-based educational
resource specifically for supporting students with ASD. The
manual provides sections on implementation of the interven-
tion in classroom practice, resources, case studies, and the
ACAE Self-Review Checklist.
The purpose of the ACAE Self-Review Checklist is to
maintain fidelity of the educational approach and to provide
improved quality, consistency, and standards of education
for the students withASD. TheACAE Self-Review Checklist
is administered in Aspect schools on an annual cycle.
Aspect Schools Implementation
Once there is an evidence-base for supporting implementa-
tion of an innovation, a staff Learning and Development
Program is offered to teachers from all Aspect schools,
including those who were not involved in the research. Each
of the eight Aspect schools trains several staff members,
including the school coordinator (senior teacher) to use the
intervention, and they are then responsible for supporting the
implementation in their school. Usually the school principal
will initially nominate one or two classes, so that the teachers
can develop teaching strategies and resources that suit their
classes. These classroom teachers in turn support the adop-
tion of the new intervention across the school.
Aspect Model Class
The Aspect Model Class Program was developed to show-
case a specific innovation. Each Aspect school has at least
one classroom that is set up to demonstrate a specific innova-
tion. The class teacher and teacher's aide are trained in the
implementation of the intervention and are supported by the
school coordinator who ensures that the intervention is
included in the class program and the Individual Education
Plans of the students. Each Model Class is supported with
classroom resources, and professional development work-
shops, including pre-service and in-service teacher training
and learning support team programs. Parent information fact
sheets are also available for all Model Classes.
Aspect currently has six different Model Classes as part of
the Model Class Program. Each Model Class is based on the
outcomes of a research evaluation carried out over the last 5
years by Aspect. Each Aspect school hosts a different Model
Class Program, based on the evidence-based research evalu-
ation in which they played a lead role. Some examples of
Model Classes are as follows: iPad Technology, Language
Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) program
(Bedwani, Winchester, Simmons, Roberson, & Costley,
2013); Pivotal Response Training Intervention (Kilham &
Costley, 2012); Secret Agents Society social skills program
(Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2013); Treatment and Education of
Autistic and related Communication-handicapped Children
(TEACCH)-structured teaching intervention (Kilham &
Williams, 2011; Mesibov, Shea, & Schopler, 2004), and the
ACAE in Practice Model Class.
Dissemination
Information about the Evidence-Based Research Trials is
disseminated through various means. Within Aspect, evi-
dence of program efficacy is regularly reported through pro-
fessional development workshops, Model Classes, and
newsletters. Parents are informed about the school practices
through the Model Classes, newsletters, and program
updates. Parents whose children participated in research tri-
als receive summary reports about the findings when reports
are published.
Aspect research information is also disseminated to the
public in other ways. Aspect regularly conducts community
professional development workshops for families and pro-
fessionals who support children living with ASD. These
workshops share information about working with evidence-
based programs for children with ASD. Peer-reviewed jour-
nal articles are published with the findings, and we encourage
researchers who conduct the studies to present their findings
at relevant education conferences.
The summary findings from the iPad study have attracted
widespread interest from the Aspect school community. In
addition to Aspect staff professional development work-
shops, the summary findings from the iPad study have so far
been distributed to families who participated in the research
and through newsletter updates to the Aspect education com-
munity. Once the refereed journal articles have been pub-
lished, community and professional workshops and
conference presentations are planned.
Discussion
The gap between research and school implementation in ASD
education has highlighted the need for more rigorous evalua-
tion of interventions and supports (Kasari & Smith, 2013;
Parsons et al., 2013; Parsons & Cobb, 2011; White et al., 2013;
Wong et al., 2014). TheASDEE model presented in this article
provides a systematic process for ethically trialling, rigorously
evaluating, and reliably implementing an educational support
or intervention for children with ASD. This model has been
tested through a series of Continuous Improvement Projects,
Small Pilot Studies, and Evidence-Based Research Trials. The

findings from the Evidence-Based Research Trials have been
published in peer-reviewed journals (Baldwin, Costley, &
Warren, 2014; Keane et al., 2012; Power & Costley, 2014),
books (Costley et al., 2012), andAspect-published and distrib-
uted fact sheets, e-newsletters (Bedwani et al., 2013; Kilham
& Costley, 2012; Kilham & Williams, 2011), and community
and professional development workshops.
The strength of the ASDEE model is that it provides the
Aspect staff with a consistent method for evaluating the lat-
est technology or intervention. The gap between research
and classroom practice can be managed through a methodi-
cal evaluation of a variety of evidence, as well as ethically
conducted and evaluated evidence-based research studies
directly in the classroom. By assessing new intervention pro-
grams or support devices in a trial class (Small Pilot Study),
and more widely through multiple classes in several schools
(Evidence-Based Research Trial), the participant sample size
for the research will be large enough to adequately represent
the population, within the context of students with ASD, and
therefore draw reliable conclusions from the findings (Odom
et al., 2005). By evaluating several classes, across two or
more schools, the studies aim to mitigate against introducing
a bias when interpreting the results from individual case
studies and very small group studies. At present, there is no
definitive sample size within the refereed ASD educational
literature that is considered to have statistical power as vari-
ability of the student's educational requirements needs dif-
ferent research methodologies to evaluate efficacy (Odom
et al., 2010; Odom et al., 2005).
The ASDEE model offers a resource-efficient method for
operating within the classroom. The resources and effort
used in evaluating an intervention are based around educa-
tional principles that are identified in theACAE. TheASDEE
model demonstrates how evidence can be assembled from
traditional peer-reviewed academic publications or from evi-
dence-informed or anecdotal sources. This flexibility in
identifying evidence allows for evaluation of new interven-
tions before peer-reviewed articles are available. It also pro-
vides the opportunity to evaluate interventions that have
been trialled by parents or professionals, such as occupa-
tional or speech therapists, with promising results.
One of the difficulties that the evaluation programs face is
resistance from students, parents, and teachers. All too often,
the potential participants feel they are evaluated too fre-
quently and this can lead to a lower percentage of the stu-
dent, parent, or teacher cohort being involved. To overcome
this feeling of evaluation fatigue, researchers must ade-
quately explain the benefits of the evaluation to the students,
as well as the risks. It is also imperative that the evaluations
do not involve overly time-consuming surveys for parents
and teachers. In our experience, we find that short pre-inter-
vention and post-intervention surveys with targeted ques-
tions are a successful method of evaluation.
The future of the ACAE is a cycle of Continuous
Improvement Projects. Schools regularly undertake theACAE
Self-Review Checklist, and the school's collated results feed
into the frequently updated manual. As new interventions and
support devices are developed, the workflow processes of the
ASDEE model are monitored and the findings are dissemi-
nated. The staff are encouraged to submit Research and Ethics
Applications, to conduct research, and to share their findings
through the delivery of workshops and peer-reviewed forums
such as journals and conference presentations.
The ASDEE model is one step toward closing the gap
between the research laboratory and the classroom. It pro-
vides a clearly defined pathway for educators to identify,
evaluate, and implement new innovations that appear to offer
support to students with ASD in a shorter time frame.
Conclusion
This article suggests that the gap between research and class-
room practice in ASD education is a problem that can be
managed through regular classroom program evaluation and
reporting. The ACAE is a systematic curriculum methodol-
ogy that is regularly evaluated and updated. By adhering to
the workflow ASDEE model, educators can identify evi-
dence of a new educational intervention, conduct an evalua-
tion, identify effective programs, implement the innovation,
and share and disseminate the findings. Through methodical
evaluation and continuous improvement processes, better
student outcomes can be achieved.
