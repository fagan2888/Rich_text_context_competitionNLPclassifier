Sex and race diVerences in young people's
responsiveness to price and tobacco control
policies
Frank J Chaloupka, Rosalie Liccardo Pacula
Abstract
Objective--To determine if there are
diVerences in young people's responsive-
ness to price and tobacco control policies
for population subgroups and to examine
whether or not these diVerences, if they
exist, can explain sex and racial
diVerences in trends in the prevalence of
smoking in young people in the United
States.
Design--Use cross-sectional and inter-
temporal variation in local and state
tobacco control policies and prices to cal-
culate demand responses to these policies
using regression analysis techniques.
Subjects--A nationally representative
sample of American eighth grade (ages
13­14 years), 10th grade (15­16 years) and
12th grade (17­18 years) students obtained
from the 1992­1994 Monitoring the Future
surveys.
Main outcome measure--Thirty-day
smoking prevalence.
Results--Young men are much more
responsive to changes in the price of ciga-
rettes than young women. The prevalence
elasticity for young men is almost twice as
large as that for young women. Smoking
rates of young black men are significantly
more responsive to changes in price than
young white men. Significant diVerences
in responsiveness to particular tobacco
control policies also exist. These diVer-
ences, however, explain relatively little of
the diVerences in smoking prevalence
among young population subgroups.
Conclusions--Policymakers need to keep
in mind that there is not a "one-size fits
all" strategy for discouraging smoking
among young people.

Introduction
Nationally representative studies of the Ameri-
can population consistently report significant
sex and racial diVerences in young people's
smoking rates. According to data presented in
the 1994 surgeon general's report, young
whites are more than twice as likely to report
smoking in the previous month than young
blacks. Although smoking rates among young
women were higher than young men during the
1980s, this trend has reversed itself in the
1990s, with more young men reporting that
they currently smoke than young women.1
Although the diVerences in smoking rates are
well documented, little research has been done
to help explain why these diVerences exist or
whether they persist over time.
An examination of historical trends in smok-
ing rates among a nationally representative
sample of high-school seniors (aged 13­18
years) reveal that the diVerences we see today
in smoking rates have not persisted. Figure 1
shows 30-day smoking prevalence among
high-school seniors by sex and race from 1975
to 1997. Although smoking prevalence among
all four groups declined from 1977 to 1980, the
smoking rates move in very diVerent directions
throughout the 1980s. Smoking prevalence
among young blacks continued to decrease
throughout the 1980s. Similarly smoking rates
among young women fell throughout the
1980s, but the declines are not nearly as large
as those observed among young blacks. Smok-
ing rates in young men and young whites, how-
ever, levelled oV in the early 1980s and started
to climb slowly throughout the 1980s. Interest-
ingly, from 1991 to 1996 there is again a paral-
lel movement in the smoking rates of these four
groups, but now smoking rates among young
men are higher than smoking rates among
young women.
What caused these dramatic diVerences in
smoking rates during the 1980s? One possible
explanation is that there was a large change in
a significant predictor of young people's smok-
ing during this time period that influenced
these four groups diVerently. For example,
between 1981 to 1990, the average real price of
a pack of 20 cigarettes rose from a 25-year low

of US$0.69 to $1.10.2 This represents a 63%
increase in the real price of a pack of cigarettes.
Previous economic research shows that young
people are sensitive to changes in the price of
cigarettes.3 It may be that this significant price
increase influenced smoking rates of young
population subgroups diVerently.
In this paper we examine diVerences in
young people's responsiveness to changes in
price and specific tobacco control policies
using a nationally representative sample of
young people from the Monitoring the Future
surveys. We find that significant diVerences do
exist, by sex and by race. For example, young
men are much more responsive to changes in
the price of cigarettes than young women; the
prevalence elasticity for young men is almost
twice as large as that for young women.
Further, we find that smoking rates of young
black men are significantly more responsive to
changes in price than those for young white
men. We also find that there are significant dif-
ferences in young people's responsiveness to
tobacco control initiatives by race. Smoking
rates among young whites are much more
responsive than among young blacks to
anti-tobacco activities and clean indoor air
restrictions. Smoking rates among young
blacks, on the other hand, are significantly
influenced by smoker protection laws and
restrictions on youth access, whereas smoking
rates among young whites are not.
Methods
Data on young people's smoking prevalence
come from the 1992­1994 Monitoring the
Future surveys of eighth grade (ages 13­14
years), 10th grade (15­16 years) and 12th
grade (17­18 years) students living in the con-
tiguous United States conducted by the
Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Every year since 1975, the
ISR has collected data on tobacco, alcohol, and
other drug use from a nationally representative
sample of approximately 17 000 high-school
seniors. In 1991, comparable surveys of eighth
and 10th grade students were added. The sur-
vey is conducted in school and addresses young
people's attitudes, perceptions, and use of legal
and illicit drugs. Given the sensitive nature of
the subject matter, great care is taken to ensure
reliable and valid responses. For example, par-
ents are not informed of their child's responses.
From responses to these surveys, a dichoto-
mous indicator of smoking prevalence is
constructed that is set equal to one for young
people reporting any cigarette consumption in
the previous 30 days and zero otherwise. In
addition, various other socioeconomic and
demographic variables can be constructed
from the general background data that are col-
lected. Variables used in this analysis include:
sex (male or female), race (white, black, and
other race), age, average weekly income from
all sources (employment, allowances, and
other), current grade (eighth, 10th, or 12th),
marital status (married/engaged or single),
parental education (less than high-school
graduate, high-school graduate, more than
high-school graduate), family structure (live
alone, only mother present, only father present,
both parents present, live with other(s)), moth-
er's work status while the child was growing up
(not employed, employed part-time, employed
fulltime), existence of siblings, average number
of hours worked weekly, living in rural/urban
area, and frequency of participation in
religious services (no participation, infrequent
participation, and frequent participation). Year
dummy variables are also included for 1992
and 1993 to control for diVerences in smoking
rates across time.
Based on each person's county of residence,
measures of cigarette price and state and local
tobacco control policies are added to the survey
data. The cigarette price measure reflects the
average state-level price for a pack of 20
cigarettes and is taken from the Tobacco
Institute's annual The tax burden on tobacco.4 It is
a weighted average of the prices of single packs,
cartons, and vending machine sales and includes
state-level excise taxes and the price of generics.
To capture potential cross-border shopping for
cigarettes that, if excluded, may bias estimates of
price towards zero, an additional variable repre-
senting the largest price diVerence between the
person's state of residence and states within 25
miles of the person's county of residence is also
included. This variable is set equal to zero for
those young people who live in states with lower
prices than nearby states and for young people
who live in counties more than 25 miles from
another state.
Four variables capturing state and local
tobacco policies are also merged into the data.
The first is a dummy variable set equal to one
in those states that earmark a portion of
cigarette tax revenues for anti-tobacco
activities and zero otherwise. Those states that
set aside these funds are generally believed to
be more aggressive in discouraging smoking.
The second is another dummy variable set
equal to one in those states that have some
form of smoker protection legislation and
equal to zero otherwise. These laws typically
protect smokers from discrimination in the
workplace and elsewhere and may reflect a
greater "pro-smoking" sentiment in the states
that have them.
The final two variables are indices of clean
indoor air restrictions and youth access laws
passed at the state and local level. The index of
clean indoor air restrictions represents the sum
of five independent variables capturing the
fraction of the population in the person's
county of residence subject to state or local
restrictions on smoking in private work sites,
restaurants, retail stores, schools, and other
public places.
The index of youth access is constructed
similarly by summing five diVerent variables
capturing diVerent aspects of youth access.
The first two variables included in this index
are dummy variables set equal to one if the
state has a minimum legal purchase age of at
least 18 and if the state requires point-of-sale
signage stating the minimum legal purchase
age. Two other variables included in this index
represent the fraction of the county population
in the person's county of residence that is sub-

ject to restrictions on vending machine sales
and distribution of free samples. The last vari-
able included in this index represents the frac-
tion of the county population who are living in
areas where vendors are required to have a
licence to sell tobacco products.
The data on state-level policies were taken
from the Coalition on Smoking OR Health's
(CSH) annual State legislated actions on tobacco
issues.5 Similar information on county and city-
level restrictions was obtained from the
National Cancer Institute's monograph
summarising major local control policies,
updated with information from CSH.6
Descriptive statistics for the variables of
interest by sex and race are provided in table 1.
As has been found in other surveys, smoking
rates among young blacks (8.0%) are
significantly lower than those of young whites
(25.6%) in our sample. There is no significant
diVerence in smoking prevalence by sex,
however. Approximately 23% of young men
and young women report currently smoking.
Only a few of the policy variables diVer across
the groups. On average, fewer young blacks are
found in states that pass smoker protection
laws. Similarly, fewer black youths live in states
with tougher restrictions on smoking in public
places.
Results
Using as controls the variables described
above, the probability of smoking in the previ-
ous 30 days was estimated for young men,
young women, young blacks, young whites,
young black men, young white men, young
black women, and young white women using
separate probit maximum likelihood specifica-
tions. Each specification includes a measure of
the price of cigarettes along with the
border-purchase variable. However, as the
tobacco control policies are highly correlated,
only one policy variable could be included in
the regression equation at a time. We therefore
estimated each of the eight sex/race specific
specifications five separate times, once with
just the price included and four times with
price and a diVerent tobacco control policy. As
most of the policy variables are measured at the
state level, standard errors are corrected for
correlation created by having multiple
observations within a single state using the
cluster option in STATA 5.0. Although similar
models were run using daily smoking instead of
30-day prevalence, these results are not
presented. Models of daily smoking could only
be estimated for some of the subpopulations
due to a small number of observations (for
example, only 387 young blacks in the sample
are daily smokers). The results for daily smok-
ing in those subpopulations we were able to
estimate are consistent with the findings
presented here for 30-day prevalence. The only
notable diVerence is that the eVects of price are
larger for daily smoking than for past-month
smoking.
Table 2 reports the marginal eVects obtained
from each of these separate regressions for the
key policy variables, and table 3 summarises
the main findings. In table 3, a dash indicates
that the marginal eVect of the variable on the
probability of smoking was negative while the
plus sign indicates that the marginal eVect of
the variable was positive. The average price
elasticity resulting from the five diVerent policy
specifications of the models is reported in the
final column. Although earmarking of state
cigarette tax revenue to promote anti-tobacco
activities has a negative and significant eVect
on smoking prevalence for young men and
women, it is only smoking by young whites that
is aVected by this policy. State earmarking has
no significant eVect in any of the model speci-
fications run separately for black youths.
Smoker protection laws, on the other hand,
have the largest positive eVect on smoking rates
by young blacks, and in particular young black
males. Smoking prevalence of young whites,
male and female, is not aVected by the
existence of smoker protection laws. Clean
indoor air laws significantly decrease smoking
prevalence among young white males, but have
no significant eVect on any of the other groups
of adolescents. Stricter youth access laws, on
the other hand, significantly decrease smoking
rates among young black males and females
but have no significant eVect on the smoking
prevalence of young whites.
Economists use the price elasticity of
demand as a way of measuring the responsive-
ness of the demand for a commodity to
changes in the price of that commodity. It is
measured as the per cent change in the
quantity of the product demanded, or in this
case the percent change in the probability of
smoking cigarettes, given a 1% increase in the
commodity's price, or
d
= % Q / % P. When
a change in the probability of using a product is
examined instead of the actual quantity
demanded, we refer to this as a prevalence
elasticity. A value greater than one in absolute
value indicates that the change in the probabil-
ity of smoking is greater in percentage terms
than the change in the price of the commodity,
and we say that consumption is very responsive
to changes in price. A value less than one in
absolute terms would indicate that the change
in the probability of smoking was smaller in

percentage terms than the change in price,
meaning that consumption is relatively less
responsive to price.
Looking at the average price elasticities
reported in the final column of table 2 we see
that smoking prevalence among young men is
much more sensitive to changes in price than
smoking prevalence by young women,
regardless of race. Smoking by young black
men is the most price sensitive; a 10% increase
in the price of cigarettes is estimated to result
in a 16.5% decrease in smoking prevalence
among young black men, holding everything
else constant. The same price increase would
result in a reduction in smoking prevalence of
8.6% among young white men. Smoking
prevalence among women is less responsive to
price than it is among young men. While statis-
tically significant eVects of price are found for
young white women, in most of the models, the
price of cigarettes had no significant eVect on
the probability of smoking for young black
females.
Discussion
It should be kept in mind when interpreting
these findings that most of the tobacco control
policies included in this analysis only measure
the existence of a policy and not its actual
enforcement. There is considerable evidence in
the recent literature suggesting that it is the
enforcement of these policies and not the poli-
cies themselves that change behaviour.3 7 8 This
suggests that one interpretation of the findings
presented here is that particular tobacco
control policies are enforced diVerentially in a
manner that is somehow correlated with sex
and race. Such an interpretation cannot be
ruled out without detailed information on the

enforcement activities surrounding each of the
policies. However, the most consistently
significant policy variable is the price of
cigarettes, which is not a function of
enforcement. Higher prices have a negative and
significant eVect on smoking prevalence for all
of the groups examined, except for young black
women, but even here there is significant varia-
tion in the responsiveness by subpopulation. It
is possible that some of this variation may be
due to correlation with unobserved factors that
have not been adequately controlled for in our
models, such as socioeconomic status. The
models do include controls for parental educa-
tion, mother's working status, and the
individual's weekly income, but no clean meas-
ure of family income or wealth is available from
the data. However, findings from another
nationally representative study of young adults
(ages 18­25) show similar diVerences in price
responsiveness by sex and ethnicity, and this
study does include more comprehensive meas-
ures of income.9
To what extent do the observed diVerences
in price sensitivity explain the divergence in
smoking trends that were observed in the
1980s? Assuming that young people's smoking
prevalence elasticities are fairly constant over
time, it is possible to use the elasticities
reported in table 3 to predict the change in
smoking prevalence expected given the 63%
increase in real price that occurred from 1981
to 1990. In table 4, we record the actual and
predicted change in smoking prevalence for the
four basic subgroups represented in the figure.
It is clear from the diVerences in predicted and
actual values that the change in price alone
does not adequately explain the actual patterns
of smoking prevalence for all of the subgroups.
Given the elasticities calculated in table 3 and
the enormous change in price during the
1980s, we would have expected to see smoking
rates among all four groups decline, with
smoking among black youths falling the most
and smoking rates among young women falling
the least. Although smoking rates among
young blacks did experience the largest decline
during the 1980s, the decline was not nearly as
large as our model predicts. The same is true
for young women. Smoking rates among young
men and young whites actually rose during the
period, however, contrary to what our model
predicts.
The poor performance of our model at
explaining the shifts in smoking prevalence in
these population subgroups during the 1980s
is not that surprising as it assumes that
everything else that may influence young
people's smoking is held constant throughout
the period. This was certainly not the case. For
example, at the same time that the tobacco
industry started raising the price of cigarettes,
it dramatically increased its spending on adver-
tising and promotion. Between 1981 and 1990
total advertising and promotional expenditures
for the industry nearly tripled.1 This increase in
advertising and promotion is not accounted for
in our analysis and may be oVsetting the eVect
of price on smoking rates. To the extent that
advertising and promotional activities target
specific subgroups more than others, and to
the extent that some young populations may be
more responsive to these activities, this
increase in tobacco industry marketing expen-
ditures is likely to influence young people's
smoking rates diVerently as well. There may be
other missing determinants as well.
Even with these shortcomings, it is clear
from this analysis that diVerent youths respond
diVerently to changes in price and public poli-
cies. Significant diVerences exist by sex and
race, suggesting that public health profession-
als and policymakers need to keep in mind who
their target user is when determining policy.
There is clearly not a "one size fits all" strategy
for discouraging young people's smoking.
