BACKGROUND: Body composition estimates for the US population are important in order to analyze trends in obesity,
sarcopenia and other weight-related health conditions. National body composition estimates have not previously been
available.
OBJECTIVE: To use transformed bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data in sex-specific, multicomponent model-derived
prediction formulae, to estimate total body water (TBW), fat-free mass (FFM), total body fat (TBF), and percentage body fat
(%BF) using a nationally representative sample of the US population.
DESIGN: Anthropometric and BIA data were from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III;
1988 ­ 1994). Sex-specific BIA prediction equations developed for this study were applied to the NHANES data, and mean values
for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF were estimated for selected age, sex and racial-ethnic groups.
RESULTS: Among the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American participants aged 12 ­ 80 y examined in
NHANES III, 15 912 had data available for weight, stature and BIA resistance measures. Males had higher mean TBW and FFM
than did females, regardless of age or racial-ethnic status. Mean TBW and FFM increased from the adolescent years to mid-
adulthood and declined in older adult age groups. Females had higher mean TBF and %BF estimates than males at each age
group. Mean TBF also increased with older age groups to approximately 60 y of age after which it decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: These mean body composition estimates for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF based upon NHANES III BIA data provide
a descriptive reference for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in the US population.

Introduction
Overweight and obesity are increasing in the US population.1,2
Excess adiposity is the major weight-related health concern up
to the seventh decade of life, but an increased lifespan3
indicates the importance of lean tissue loss and its association
with frailty and sarcopenia in the elderly.4,5 Fat and lean
components of the body including total body fat (TBF),
fat-free mass (FFM), and total body water (TBW) are important
constituents that link obesity, aging, and chronic disease with
subsequent morbidity and mortality.6 ­ 8 There exists little
accurate information at present on estimates of TBW, FFM,
TBF, and percentage fat (%BF) for the US population as a
whole.9 ­ 11 Systems capable of reliably quantifying body com-
position under controlled conditions, such as bioelectrical
impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DXA), have been introduced and subsequently validated
over the past two decades.12,13 This technology and the
increasing clinical and research importance of body com-
position highlight the need for improved information on
population estimates of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF.
Prior surveys and studies of body composition in the
US population are based largely on anthropometric data
including measures of body weight, stature, skinfold thick-

nesses and circumferences. These provide correlates of
fatness (ie body mass index; BMI) or approximate estimates
of regional and total body fatness. These data for the US
population collected over the past 30 y have a limited
ability to quantify body composition. The report of the
1994 NIH-sponsored Technology Assessment Conference,
`Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in Body Composition
Measurement',14 recommended that national reference
distributions for body composition be developed using BIA
data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey.15 BIA systems are calibrated for the popula-
tion under study by developing prediction formulae based
on criterion methods from resistance, stature and other
easily acquired variables.16 ­ 20 Most of these predictive equa-
tions are based on limited samples and two-component
models that describe fat and FFM only.21 To use the
NHANES III BIA data to estimate national body composition
distributions, a set of externally derived BIA prediction
equations were developed using isotope dilution to predict
TBW and a multicomponent model to predict FFM.22
These equations provided estimates for the major body
compartments when applied to the NHANES III data for
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-
Americans aged 12 ­ 80 y. This report fulfills the recommen-
dation of the 1994 NIH Conference14 with the presentation
of cross-sectional estimates for mean TBW, FFM, TBF and
%BF by sex and age for these three racial-ethnic groups in the
US population.
Methods
Sample
The NHANES III was a nationally representative, two-phase,
6 y, cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 until 1994.15
The complex sampling plan used a stratified, multistage,
probability cluster design. The initial sampling of house-
holds, identification of participants, and the collection of
data in mobile examination centers in NHANES III were
similar to that in previous NHANES.15 An individual's
racial-ethnic status was self-identified.
The total NHANES III sample consisted of 31 311 exami-
ned participants. Children younger than 12 y of age and
pregnant women were not eligible for the BIA procedure in
NHANES III. There were also very few participants over 80 y
of age. After excluding 12 562 participants with ages < 12 y
or > 80 y, 798 participants with race-ethnicity other than
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black or Mexican
American and 2039 participants missing weight, stature
and=or BIA resistance, the available analytic sample con-
tained 15 912 participants. The developed BIA prediction
equations22 were applied to this sub-sample, but additional
exclusions were made when predicted TBW exceeded 80% of
body weight (n ¼ 1), or when the calculated TBF was
negative (n ¼ 8). These last exclusions resulted in a final
sample of 15 903 participants, 2880 non-Hispanic white
males, 3277 non-Hispanic white females, 2348 non-
Hispanic black males, 2606 non-Hispanic black females,
2494 Mexican American males, and 2298 Mexican American
females, for development of the body composition distribu-
tion data.
Measurements
Documentation for the NHANES III procedures includes
written descriptions15 and a video demonstration.23 Body
weight was measured with an electronic load cell scale to the
nearest 0.01 kg. Participants wore only under-shorts and
disposable paper shirts, pants and foam slippers but no
adjustment was made for this minimal clothing weight
(0.18 kg) in the analyses. Stature was measured to the nearest
0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. Participants were posi-
tioned with heels, buttocks, back and head against the
upright surface of the stadiometer with the head positioned
in the Frankfort horizontal plane.
Participants had a single, tetrapolar BIA measurement of
resistance (Res) and reactance at 50 kHz taken between the
right wrist and ankle while in a supine position, using
Valhalla 1990B Bio-Resistance Body Composition Analyzer
(Valhalla Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA).24 the decision
regarding the selection of the impedance analyzer was
made ca 1986. The reactance values were not used in the
body composition prediction equations22 and, therefore,
are not presented or discussed further. The measure-
ment accuracy of the Valhalla impedance machines used
in NHANES III was independently certified by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology following
the survey.
Body composition calculations
Conversion of NHANES III BIA values. The TBW and FFM
prediction equations22 used Res data from RJL bioelectrical
impedance analyzers (RJL, Clinton Twp, MI, USA). The
NHANES III BIA data were obtained with a Valhalla impe-
dance analyzer. However, all BIA resistance data reported
in this manuscript are converted RJL Res values because
there are no prediction equations from large-scale studies
using Valhalla bioimpedance instruments. Before applying
the TBW and FFM prediction equations to these data,
the Valhalla Res value for each NHANES III subject
was converted to an equivalent RJL Res value using equa-
tions developed from a separate, independent sample.
Details of this conversion process are presented in the
Appendix.
Prediction equations. The TBW and FFM, BIA prediction
equations listed below22 were applied to the respective
NHANES III anthropometric and converted BIA resistance
data for each selected NHANES III participant to derive
estimates for TBW and FFM. The converted NHANES III,
RJL resistance values were used to calculated the impedance

Estimates for TBF and %BF for each NHANES III participant
were derived from their corresponding estimated FFM using
the equations TBF ¼ weight 7 FFM and %BF ¼ TBF=weight.
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations
and standard errors for estimates of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF
were calculated for defined age, sex and racial-ethnic groups.
The age groups were defined at 2 y intervals from 12 to 20 y
of age and at 10 y intervals thereafter. These means were also
presented graphically with the values plotted at the middle
of each age group. The mean values for TBW, FFM, TBF and
%BF were estimated using SAS25 and include the appropriate
survey sampling weights to produce representative estimates
for selected groups in the civilian, non-institutionalized
population of the US. The sample weights account for
sampling variability and adjust the data for differential
probability of selection of persons in the NHANES III com-
plex sample survey design.
Variance estimation. The means presented in this report
are based on data collected from a complex sample design,
and techniques that account for this design were used to
estimate the standard errors of these means (ie the square
root of their variance). Variance estimates based on the
complex sample design are different from and generally
larger than those obtained under the assumption of simple
random sampling. SUDAAN, a statistical software package
that incorporates the sample weights and accounts for the
complex sample design through Taylor Series linearization
was used to estimate the design effects.26 Details of the
variance estimation process are found in the Appendix.
Results
Tests of statistical significance were not performed because
the results for several of the variables are calculated esti-
mates, and the objective of this paper was to present descrip-
tive information only. A qualitative review of these findings
suggests that differences among the groups conform to
findings from other large and small-scale studies. Means for
weight, stature, BMI, Res and S2=Res are shown in Tables 1 ­ 3.
Estimated means for TBW, FFM, TBF, and %BF are shown in
Tables 4 ­ 7 and Figures 1 ­ 4, and they are summarized in the
following text.
Anthropometry and BIA
The number of participants in NHANES III available to
construct the body composition distributions by age, sex
and racial-ethnic groups are presented in Tables 1 ­ 3 along
with descriptive statistics for the measured and calculated
independent variables. As expected, across racial-ethnic
groups at ages ! 14 y, mean statures and weights were
larger for males than females. Within each race-ethnic
group for males and females, mean weights and BMIs
increased almost consistently up to age 60 y and decreased
afterwards. The BMI means were larger among non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American females than non-Hispanic
white females at almost all ages, but especially in the
adults. Non-Hispanic black adult females had the largest
mean BMI values. Among the adult males, the BMI means
were approximately equal to most ages.
The females had larger mean estimates for Res than the
males. Means estimates for S2=Res were larger for males than
the females at all ages. This is consistent with an expected
greater fluid volume associated with a greater FFM among
males.
The Res means for non-Hispanic white females exceeded
those of non-Hispanic black females at all but one age group.
The non-Hispanic white females also had larger Res means
than the Mexican-American females at all but two of the
younger age groups. There was no consistent pattern
between the non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American
females in Res means as they varied by age groups. However,
mean estimates for S2=Res for non-Hispanic black females
were consistently larger than those of non-Hispanic white
females at all but one age group, and both these groups of
females had mean estimates larger than those of Mexican-
American females at all age groups.
The non-Hispanic black males had larger Res means than
the non-Hispanic white males at all ages, but Res means
varied between the non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
American males by age groups. This variation by age
groups also existed for mean Res values between the
non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American males. Mean
estimates for S2=Res for non-Hispanic white males were
consistently larger than those of non-Hispanic black males
at all but one age group, and both these groups of males had
larger mean estimates than those of Mexican-American
males at all age groups.
Comparative distributions of body compartments
Total body water and fat-free mass. As shown in Tables 4
and 5 and Figures 1 and 2, the means for TBW and FFM
within racial-ethnic groups had similar patterns across age
groups. Among males, the estimated TBW and FFM means

increased during adolescence in all racial-ethnic groups. A
progressive, but lesser increase in the adult male age groups
followed until about age 60 y, after which the estimated
means for TBW and FFM decreased. Females in all racial-
ethnic groups had comparatively lower estimates for mean
TBW and FFM than males. Among females, the increase from
13 to 19 y of age was not as pronounced as it was in males.
Estimated means for TBW and FFM for females gradually
increased across age groups until age 45 ­ 55 y after which
they decreased for both.
Among males, estimated TBW and FFM means were gene-
rally larger for non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic

the standard deviations were $4 ­ 5 l for non-Hispanic white
and Mexican-American females and $5 ­ 6 l for non-
Hispanic black females. This same pattern of larger standard
deviations in non-Hispanic blacks also occurred for FFM, but
here the standard deviations for non-Hispanic whites were
larger than those of the Mexican-Americans. The standard
deviations at all the age groups for FFM were $9 ­ 10 kg for
non-Hispanic white males, $8 ­ 9 kg for Mexican-American
males and $9 ­ 11 kg for non-Hispanic black males. For the
females, the standard deviations were $5 ­ 6 kg for non-
Hispanic white females $5 ­ 6 kg for Mexican-American
females and $5 ­ 8 kg for non-Hispanic black females.

Total body fat and percentage body fat. As presented in
Tables 6 and 7 and Figures 3 and 4, females had larger
estimated TBF and %BF means than males at all ages.
Across racial-ethnic groups, TBF means for males did not
shown any appreciable differences. In contrast, estimates for
TBF means were largest for non-Hispanic black females,
followed by Mexican-American and then non-Hispanic
white females. Plots of these TBF means by sex, race and
the selected age groups are presented in Figure 3. Between 13
and 19 y of age, Mexican-American males tended to have
larger TBF means than non-Hispanic white and black males,
after which these differences were small except for 25 y of age.

Non-Hispanic black females had larger TBF means than
Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white females at
almost all ages, and this difference was greater after 25 y of
age. At the same time, Mexican-American females also had
larger TBF means than non-Hispanic white females at most
ages. In the plots for all age groups, mean TBF increased
consistently for all males and females with each older age
category until about 55 ­ 65 y of age. Afterwards, there was a
consistent decline in TBF means in both sexes.
Estimates for mean %BF were slightly larger for Mexican-
American males than for non-Hispanic white or non-
Hispanic black males where estimates for mean %BF were

quite similar across age groups. However, estimated %BF
means were noticeably similar across adult ages for non-
Hispanic black and Mexican-American females. Non-Hispa-
nic whites had the lowest estimated %BF means at all ages.
Plots of these %BF means by sex, race and the selected age
groups are presented in Figure 4. The %BF means reflect to
some degree the sex, ethnic and age patterns for TBF.
These sex differences were greatest for non-Hispanic blacks
then Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. At the
25 y age category, the mean %BF for males was about
21 ­ 23%, but in females the means were 30 ­ 35%. At the
13 y age group, girls were on average as fat as males would
ever get.
Between 13 and 19 y of age, Mexican-American males had
larger %BF means than non-Hispanic white and black males
at all ages. At most other ages, there were small differences
between non-Hispanic black and white males in %BF means.
Between 13 and 19 y of age, Mexican-American females had
larger %BF means than non-Hispanic black and white
females and non-Hispanic black females had larger means
than non-Hispanic white females. After the 19 y age group,
there were small differences in %BF means between
Mexican-American and non-Hispanic black females, both
of which were larger than the %BF means for non-Hispanic
white females. For all race groups, mean %BF increases with
each older age category until about 55 ­ 65 y of age. After-
wards, %BF means declined, but this decline was not as steep
as it was for TBF means at the same ages. The exception was
for males between 13 and 19 y where %BF means decreased
and then increased for Mexican-Americans or remained
approximately stable for non-Hispanic white and black
males. Between the 13 and 55 y age groups, mean %BF for
males increased about 5 ­ 7 percentage points, while in
females the corresponding increase was about 11 ­ 13
percentage points.

Standard deviations for TBF were $6 ­ 8 kg for non-
Hispanic white males, $5 ­ 6 kg for Mexican-American
males and $7 ­ 9 kg for non-Hispanic black males. For the
females, the standard deviations were $8 ­ 11 kg for non-
Hispanic white females, $8 ­ 10 kg for Mexican-American
females and $10 ­ 14 kg for non-Hispanic black females.
This same pattern of larger standard deviations in non-
Hispanic blacks again occurred for %BF, but here the
standard deviations for non-Hispanic whites were larger
than those of the Mexican-Americans. The standard
deviations at all the age groups for %BF were $5 ­ 7% for
non-Hispanic white males, $5 ­ 6% for Mexican-American
males and $6 ­ 7% for non-Hispanic black males. For the
females, the standard deviations were $7 ­ 8% for non-
Hispanic white females $5 ­ 7% for Mexican-American
females and $7 ­ 8% for non-Hispanic black females.
Discussion
The application of the selected equations22 to the NHANES
III BIA data presents for the first time estimates of national
distributions for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF for non-Hispanic
whites and blacks and Mexican-Americans from 12 to 80 y of
age. The selected equations are the most accurate and precise
available for predicting TBW and FFM, and they are reason-
ably generalizable for individuals with body composition
values at the extremes of the distribution.22
The patterns of the means for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF
across the age groups reflect expected associations with age
and sex. These patterns with age demonstrate sex differences
in the growth of these body constituents or the changes that
occur during adulthood with the aging process. The large
means for TBF and %BF reflect the high prevalence of obesity
that has been reported previously using the NHANES III BMI
data.1,2

Body composition distributions
Similar to other reports, males in this study generally have a
larger estimated mean TBW and FFM than females, who have
larger estimated TBF and %BF means than males.27,28 The
estimated means values from ages 12 ­ 20 y demonstrate the
sex and age relationships with body composition that occur
during adolescent growth.29 Mean TBF increases during
adolescence, but the effects of the relatively greater accretion
of FFM in males than females result in a decline in estimated
mean %BF for males around 14 ­ 16 y of age. Mean TBF
increases through adulthood. There is also an increase in
mean FFM through much of adulthood but a decline is
observed at the oldest age groups.30 These are not serial
data, so the contrast between means at adjacent age groups
may reflect actual trends in the changes in these body
composition estimates or, alternatively, differences between
the samples comprising the several age groups.
Overall, the racial-ethnic differences between non-
Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black females conform to
previously reported differences for smaller samples. Non-
Hispanic black females had slightly larger mean values for
TBW, FFM, TBF and=or %BF than non-Hispanic white
females,9,28,31 ­ 34 even though the prediction equations
tended to under-estimate TBW and FFM in non-Hispanic
blacks.22 Similar comparisons with Mexican-American
females are very limited.28,34 Reported ethnic differences in
body composition between non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black adult males differ from the present findings.
Others report that non-Hispanic black males have larger
amounts of TBW than non-Hispanic white males.31,35
Similar differences in FFM or its equivalent between non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks have been reported
by Ellis,28,34 but several other investigators have not found
such differences to be statistically significant.9,36 Comparisons
with Mexican-American males have been few.28,34 Except for
possible differences in bone mineral, racial-ethnic differ-
ences in these means for TBW, FFM, and TBF at an age or
across age are not clear at a population level. A reason for this
lack of clarity is insufficient body composition data from any
racial-ethnic group other than non-Hispanic whites.
The present body composition estimates were derived
from prediction equations, and they are subject to estima-
tion errors. Comparisons of these findings across racial-
ethnic groups should be judged accordingly. The standard
deviations for the means for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF
approximate the normal range for these variables in the
population. This range is reasonably constant from one age
group to the next within racial-ethnic groups. However, the
standard deviations reported are calculated for estimated not
measured values and therefore may underestimate the true
variability in the data.
Body composition changes in the population
Oneobservation from thesemeandistributions isthe high level
of %BF among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American
females compared with non-Hispanic white females. The
TBF and %BF means from NHANES III data are consistent
with the previously reported high prevalence of overweight1,2
and shifts in the BMI distribution observed between NHANES
II and NHANES III.38 However, it is not appropriate to deter-
mine the prevalence of obesity from these mean estimates for
TBF and %BF in the absence of definite cut-off criteria.37
These mean reference values are not an indication of an
ideal or desirable level of FFM, TBW, TBF or %BF, and should
be used cautiously as comparative reference data. The mean
BMI for adult men (BMI ¼ 26.6) and women (BMI ¼ 26.5)1
currently exceeds the recommended BMI threshold for
healthy weight (BMI < 25.0).39 Similarly, the mean %BF for
adult men and women exceeds the threshold of %BF values
that indicate obesity at a BMI > 30.0 in men (%BF > 25%)
and women (%BF > 39%),37 beginning at age 50 ­ 59 y in
non-Hispanic white and black men, at age 30 ­ 39 y in
Mexican-American men and at age 40 ­ 49 y in non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American women. The highest mean
estimate for %BF in non-Hispanic white women was 37.3%
at ages 50 ­ 59 y.
One new aspect of these data is the availability of TBW
means. Prior to the present investigation, only small sets of
TBW reference data were available31 and most of these
databases have limited application to the general US popula-
tion. These TBW means provide a general reference for the
US population by sex, age and race-ethnicity at the time the
NHANES III was conducted (1988 ­ 1994).
The FFM means provide a limited reference to assist in
determining the degree of sarcopenia or muscle loss among
the elderly.10 Low muscle mass is a major contributor to the
loss of functional ability and health.40 One limitation in
defining or in establishing a diagnosis of sarcopenia has been
the absence of a sex-, age- and racial-ethnic-specific FFM
reference.10 The present findings provide national estimates
as a reference to compare with results from other studies of
body composition, particularly FFM, in the elderly and
persons with weight-related chronic disease.
Study limitations
These reported body composition estimates are not based
on criterion measures. The mean estimates were calculated
from predicted values from the bioelectrical impedance Res
values and stature in NHANES III. The Valhalla Res values
were translated into their RJL equivalents (see Appendix),
and then TBW and FFM were predicted through regression
equations. In the conversion sample, there was a very small
consistent difference between RJL and Valhalla Res mea-
sures of 2.5 ohms for males and 9.6 ohms for females
(Appendix, Figure 1). The high r2 values for these conver-
sions are identical to previously reported correlations for
Res between Valhalla and RJL impedance analyzers.44
Others have reported larger systematic differences between
Valhalla and RJL analyzers for Res values45 than were noted
in the present conversions. However, the present systematic

differences in Res between Valhalla and RJL impedance
analyzers for males and females are less than the reported
variation in repeated measures of Res using a single impe-
dance machine.46 ­ 48
In the prediction equations, TBW was estimated from
isotope dilution, and FFM was estimated with a multi-
compartment model based on densitometry, TBW and
bone mineral content from dual-energy X-ray absorptiome-
try using pooled data from large convenience samples from
multiple study centers.22 TBF and %BF were then estimated
from FFM and weight. In each of these steps, validity errors
can be potentially introduced.
The reported mean body composition values are estimates
about which there is variation as a function of the several
methods and samples used. The magnitude of this variation
is difficult to quantify, but is assumed to be equivalent to the
pure errors from the cross validation of the prediction
equations.22 Pure errors for the TBW and FFM equations are
$4 l or kg for males and $3 l or kg for females. Cross-
validation results indicated that the equations applied in
this study slightly over-predict TBW by $0.7 and 0.6 l and
FFM by $0.3 and 0.6 kg for males and females, respectively.
The equations used to predict TBW tend to underestimate
TBW in black males ($2 l) and females ($1.4 l) and over-
estimate TBW in white males ($0.5 l) and females ($0.3 l).
The FFM equations tend to underestimate FFM in black
males ($2.1 kg) and females ($1.6 kg) and overestimate
FFM in white males ($0.4 kg) and females ($0.3 kg). These
estimates may be acceptable for comparisons within racial-
ethnic groups, but should be used cautiously in comparisons
across racial-ethnic groups.
There are other possible limitations. BIA prediction equa-
tions have limitations similar to those of skinfold prediction
equations including large standard errors of the estimates
and population specificity.41 The BIA prediction equations
were applied to Mexican-American participants in NHANES
III but were neither derived nor validated independently on
samples of Mexican-Americans so the validity of these equa-
tions for this group is unknown. There were also a few non-
Hispanic blacks available in the samples used to develop the
prediction equations resulting in potential bias for estimates
among this group. Also, the performance of the prediction
equations when applied to the NHANES III data could not be
independently verified.
Conclusion
These mean body composition estimates (Tables 4 ­ 7 and
Figures 1 ­ 4) are the first provided for the US population.
NHANES III did not have criterion body composition mea-
sures, but the availability of 50 kHz BIA data allowed the
estimation of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF using externally
derived equations based on isotope dilution for TBW and
multicomponent models for FFM. These prediction equa-
tions for TBW and FFM22 can be applied to other population
groups in the US, and the calculated TBW, FFM, TBF or %BF
values compared with the mean estimates presented in this
report.
The findings in this report conform to the many existing
relationships of body composition with age and sex. What is
new, is the availability of these mean estimates for TBW,
FFM, TBF and %BF along with their corresponding distribu-
tions at specific age categories and the availability of these
data for the three racial-ethnic groups in the NHANES III.
These means and standard deviations provide a picture of
specific aspects of body composition that could only be
inferred from the NHANES III BMI data. The newest informa-
tion from the present analysis is the estimates for mean TBW,
FFM, TBF and %BF for Mexican-American males and females.
These limited data have not been available in the past.
Measured values for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF determined
by DXA, hydrostatic weighing, or data collected using other
reference body composition methods in other studies can be
compared with the means reported for the NHANES III
sample. Systematic differences among body composition
methods and the between-method limits of agreement are
approximately 2.0 kg for FFM and 3 ­ 5% for %BF,27,42 and
should be considered when interpreting the data or making
inferences.
This study presents descriptive summary distributions for
body composition estimates derived from the 1988 ­ 1994
NHANES III. In the future, improved estimates of FFM and
TBF may become available. The present descriptive data
should be regarded as interim results and should be applied
and referenced with an awareness of the identified potential
caveats.

Conversion of NHANES III BIA values
The NHANES III BIA data were obtained with a Valhalla
impedance analyzer. Before applying the TBW and FFM
prediction equations to these data, the Valhalla Res value
for each NHANES III subject was converted to an equivalent
RJL Res value using equations developed from a separate,
independent sample. Res data collected at the same visit
between the right wrist and ankle using a Valhalla 1990B and
an RJL 101 BIA instrument were available from 197 male and
235 female participants, 12 ­ 65 y of age in the Fels Long-
itudinal Study.43 These Fels, RJL Res values were regressed
on corresponding Fels Valhalla Res values separately for
each sex.
The BIA Res conversion equations are as follows for males
and females:
For males: RJL Res ¼ 2.5 þ 0.98 Val Res; r2 ¼ 0.996,
RMSE ¼ 5.0 ohms
For females: RJL Res ¼ 9.6 þ 0.96 Val Res; r2 ¼ 0.993,
RMSE ¼ 5.3 ohms
Variance estimation
The means presented in this report are based on a complex
sample design, and techniques that account for this design
were used to estimate the standard errors of these means (ie
the square root of their variance). Variance estimates based
on the complex sample design are different from and gen-
erally larger than those obtained under the assumption of
simple random sampling. The design effect (Deff) measures
the influence of the complex sample upon the variance and
is defined as the ratio of the complex samples variance,
VarCS
, to the variance based on a simple random sample of
the same size (ie the weighted simple random sample esti-

Because of the wide variability of the design effect across
age groups within gender and race-ethnicity, the application
of an average design effect stabilizes estimates of standard
errors of the mean.49 More specifically:
 Each of the six race=ethnic (re ¼ 1, 2, 3) and gender
(g ¼ 1, 2) specific subgroups was partitioned into seven
subgroups.
 Design effects for each of these seven subgroups were
estimated for reth and gth group:
DEFF(BIA)re;g;a
a ¼ 1; . . . ; 7
 A mean design effect across the seven age groups was
calculated:

 The complex sample standard error of the mean BIA for
the reth race=ethnic, gth gender and ath subdomain
sem(BIA)re,g,a,CS
was estimated by multiplying the
weighted simple random estimate of the standard error
of the mean for that domain s.e.m.(BIA)re,g,a,SRS
by the
square root of the corresponding race=ethnic and gender
specific mean design effect given in equation (2)

SUDAAN, a statistical software package that incorporates the
sample weights and accounts for the complex sample design
through Taylor Series linearization was used to estimate the
design effects.26 The complex sample standard deviation,
sCS
, was estimated by adding the square of the complex
sample estimate of the standard error of the mean given in
equation (3) to the square of the simple random sample
estimate of the standard deviation ^
