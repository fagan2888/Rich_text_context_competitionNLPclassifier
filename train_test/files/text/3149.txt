Abstract
This article attends to recent discussions of validity in psychometric research on human life history strategy (LHS), provides a
constructive critique of the extant literature, and describes strategies for improving construct validity. To place the psychometric
study of human LHS on more solid ground, our review indicates that researchers should (a) use approaches to psychometric
modeling that are consistent with their philosophies of measurement, (b) confirm the dimensionality of life history indicators, and
(c) establish measurement invariance for at least a subset of indicators. Because we see confirming the dimensionality of life
history indicators as the next step toward placing the psychometrics of human LHS on more solid ground, we use nationally
representative data and structural equation modeling to test the structure of middle adult life history indicators. We found
statistically independent mating competition and Super-K dimensions and the effects of parental harshness and childhood
unpredictability on Super-K were consistent with past research. However, childhood socioeconomic status had a moderate
positive effect on mating competition and no effect on Super-K, while unpredictability did not predict mating competition. We
conclude that human LHS is more complex than previously suggested--there does not seem to be a single dimension of human
LHS among Western adults and the effects of environmental components seem to vary between mating competition and Super-K.

Life history theory (LHT) explains biodiversity in terms of
fitness trade-offs faced by organisms, the most prominent of
which stem from the costs of reproduction (Stearns, 1976,
1989). According to LHT, the finite nature of resources avail-
able to organisms during evolution induced multiple-trait
trade-offs among fitness components such as current versus
future reproduction and offspring quality versus quantity (Hill
& Kaplan, 1999). The idea central to LHT is that resources
allocated to early reproduction, for instance, cannot be allo-
cated to somatic effort and longevity. In the absence of con-
straints, selection presumably maximizes allocation to all
fitness components (Agrawal, Conner, & Rasmann, 2010).
However, given that resource constraints are ubiquitous in
nature, species vary in terms of traits such as developmental
tempo, reproductive timing, offspring number, body size, and
longevity (Stearns, 1976).
Researchers began applying LHT to variation within
humans in the 1980s and 1990s (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper,
1991; Chisholm, 1999; Draper & Harpending, 1982). Draper
and Harpending (1982) proposed that early experience
entrains development of reproductive strategies individuals
follow throughout life. Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper (1991)

proposed that stressful childhood environments (mediated by
parental stress and less stable parent­child attachments)
accelerate psychosocial development, such that individuals
who were stressed early tend to experience earlier matura-
tion, pubertal timing, sexual debut, and eventually more
unstable adult pair bonds. According to these models, early
environmental cues during the first 5­7 years of life trigger a
developmental shift toward allocation of resources to early
reproduction and mating effort at the expense of somatic and
parental effort.
Recent psychometric research has extended LHT to a broad
suite of psychosocial traits (Figueredo et al., 2006). The under-
lying rationale is that natural and sexual selection produced
clusters of coadapted traits that function as coherent reproduc-
tive strategies or life history strategies (Figueredo et al., 2006,
2015). In this view, adaptations that allocate resources between
somatic and reproductive effort and also between mating effort
and parental/nepotistic effort are executed in a coordinated
fashion, producing reproductively coherent phenotypes in
terms of personality, psychosocial characteristics, and outward
behaviors. Consistent with this, a second-order K-factor has
subsumed constructs such as planning and control, social con-
tact and support, attachment, religiosity, and altruism (for a
review, see Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014).
Lower scores on this factor are thought to correspond to faster
life history strategy (LHS) while higher scores are thought to
imply slower LHS.
Copping, Campbell, and Muncer (2014) recently identified
several important areas for improving validity in psychometric
research on human LHS, many of which are issues of construct
validity (e.g., internal structure of questionnaires designed to
measure LHS, including the Mini-K [Figueredo et al., 2006]
and High-K Strategy Scale [HKSS; Giosan, 2006]). In response
to this critique, Figueredo and colleagues (2015) argued that
the psychometric study of human LHS is on solid footing. Here
we elaborate on some of the issues identified by Copping et al.
(2014), taking into consideration the Figueredo et al. (2015)
response, by discussing approaches to psychometric modeling
and also by reviewing steps that can be taken to improve con-
struct validity when factor modeling is employed. We then take
stock of the extant psychometric literature and find that the
dimensionality of life history indicators has not been ade-
quately confirmed. Given that this is crucial for establishing
construct validity, we use nationally representative data and
structural equation modeling (SEM) with bifactor models to
test the structure of middle adult life history indicators. We
conclude by summarizing findings and providing implications
and next steps for studies of human LHS.
Philosophical Considerations
Psychometric modeling is partly guided by philosophical con-
siderations. The very first step in any effort to establish con-
struct validity is selection of a modeling approach that makes
sense, given a researcher's philosophy of measurement. Mod-
ern psychometrics is typically driven by realism or the notion
that latent variables are proxies for real variables with expla-
natory content. As described by Borsboom (2006):
One of the main breakthroughs of the past century in psycho-
metric thinking about measurement consists in the realization
that measurement does not consist of finding the right observed
score to substitute for a theoretical attribute, but of devising a
model structure to relate an observable to a theoretical attribute.
An essential precondition for this realization to occur is that,
either intuitively or explicitly, one already holds the philoso-
phical idea that theoretical attributes are, in fact, distinct from a
set of observations, i.e. that one rejects the operationalist thesis
that theoretical attributes are synonymous with the way they are
measured. (Bridgman, 1927, p. 429)
In psychometric research, factor models are commonly used to
measure psychological attributes. As Borsboom (2006)
explained, these are models of the relationships between
observed scores and latent attributes and are used to estimate
the properties of the latter. Factor models can be used in a
purely descriptive manner that does not invoke realism at least
with respect to latent variables (Jonas & Markon, 2016). The
descriptivist approach can be seen as more concerned with sta-
tistical parsimony than elucidating the nature of causal forces
responsible for patterns of covariation--it attends to what more
so than why (Harms, Wood, & Spain, 2016). The descriptivist
approach advances by discovering the shortest possible repre-
sentation of the data in an information theoretic sense, while the
realist approach attends to statistical parsimony but also places a
premium on explicating the functional or causal relationships
among variables (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heerdeen,
2003; Harms et al., 2016; Jonas & Markon, 2016).
LHS is often invoked as an organizing source or cause of
covariation among life history indicators. This conception of
LHS is not obligatory--a descriptivist approach could also be
employed. However, if higher order latent LHS variables can-
not be understood as causing multiple life history traits,
research interest would likely shift toward the individual traits.
This is because evolutionary psychological researchers typi-
cally want to characterize evolved mechanisms, not just find
the simplest way to summarize covariance among traits. Impor-
tantly, LHT attends to adaptations that evolved to successfully
cause genetic propagation, given the finite nature of resources
and variation in environmental conditions (Stearns, 1976).
Thus, in addition to determining the dimensionality of life
history indicators (i.e., the most statistically parsimonious way
to represent them), we see the psychometrics of human LHS as
concerned with realist questions about latent LHS variables:
Are the effects of latent LHS variables on their indicators
invariant across populations, settings, and time? Do latent LHS
variables fully explain the associations between their indicators
and other theoretically relevant variables (e.g., environmental
conditions)? These questions assume that it is theoretically
plausible that latent LHS variables correspond to evolved
mechanisms or unitary variables formed by evolved mechan-
isms. Of course, this is an important question in itself.
2 Evolutionary Psychology
From the perspective developed above, several recent dis-
cussions about latent LHS variables can be seen as containing
problematic claims. According to Figueredo et al. (2015),
Although the psychometric approach composites multiple indi-
cators present in the developmental pathway of the psychoso-
cial acceleration model for the purpose of constructing latent
variables, it can also be used to test components of the psycho-
social acceleration model. (p. 313)
Although compositing indicators may serve descriptive pur-
poses well, it seems somewhat antithetical to modeling a
mechanistic process such as psychosocial acceleration (see
Harms et al., 2016). Moreover, this passage is consistent with
others in psychometric studies of LHS in that it seems to con-
flate latent variables (i.e., factors) that subsume their indicators
with composites formed by researchers. In a factor model,
multiple indicators are not composited to form latent variables.
Instead, the relations among the indicators allow researchers to
determine the properties of the latent variable (Bollen, 1989;
Cohen, Cohen, Teresi, Marchi, & Velez, 1990). From a realist
perspective, this variable should be understood as causing and
therefore distinct from and temporally precedent to its indica-
tors (Borsboom et al., 2003; Edwards & Bagozzi, 2000). This
view excludes the use of early childhood events or traits as
reflective indicators of adolescent or young adult LHS, unless
the latent variable can be understood as time invariant and
therefore able to cause a reflective indicators operating early
and also later in development.
In another illustrative example, Figueredo et al. (2015)
simultaneously describe common factors as relatively agnostic
to the causal effects that link their indicators and also as the
underlying causes to which these effects are attributable:
Nevertheless, the critique makes a valid point in stating that
common factor models using global inventories such as the
ALHB are relatively agnostic with respect to possible causal
relations among its various components. Any common factor
model, and not just ours, represents the multiple convergent
indicators as effects of a common unobserved influence, which
is the latent variable hypothesized. The purpose of such ``mea-
surement models'' is to measure the phenomenon in question by
means of whatever manifest indicators can be systematically
associated with it. (p. 314)
Agnosticism to the causal relations among indicators is coher-
ent with a descriptivist approach. However, if LHS factors are
assumed to represent common unobserved influences on indi-
cators, they are not relatively agnostic to the causal nature of
latent variable­indicator relationships. In turn, many variables
will not function as valid indicators of these LHS factors. For
instance, models that specify causes of LHS as its reflective
indicators would be seen as misspecified. Unfortunately, spe-
cifying such causes in formative measurement models may also
be unviable (Edwards, 2011; Lee & Cadogan, 2013; Rhemtulla,
Riet van Bork, & Borsboom, 2015).
Finally, we consider an additional example to further illus-
trate the importance of clarifying the causal status of LHS with
respect to its indicators. In their hybrid model, Figueredo et al.
(2015, p. 314) regressed several facets of LHS on Mini-K Scale
scores. Importantly, the Mini-K scores were produced through
an aggregation of items that overlap the content of the endo-
genous variables they impacted. For example, some Mini-K
items assess the warmth of the relationships participants have
with their parents and romantic partners. In the model, these
item contents overlapped domains endogenous to the Mini-K
(e.g., romantic partner attachment and biological mother and
father). Thus, the Mini-K was not distinct from the outcomes it
influenced, a problem that likely biased estimates of its effects
(i.e., a discriminant validity problem; McGrath, 2005). Given
the validity problems plaguing this model, we contend that it
should not be seen as strong evidence that the Mini-K provides
valid measurement of its intended construct.
Researchers can avoid conceptual confusion and produce
more unbiased estimates through careful consideration and
clarification of their assumptions about latent variables. As
we noted, a descriptivist approach can be employed and does
not require the assumption that factors are exogenous to their
indicators. But if researchers are employing this approach,
what rationale is there for using directed graphs to represent
their effects? And, what rationale is there for imposing statis-
tical independence between endogenous variables such as
factor indicators? It is important to recognize that in structural
models, independencies imply strong causal assumptions
(e.g., two variables do not cause one another directly). To
date, we have not seen any explicit application of descripti-
vism in human life history research. Perhaps descriptivism
has been implicit in some studies. In the future, we recom-
mend that researchers alert readers if they are deviating from
the usual approach to factor modeling by employing descrip-
tivist principles. In the following section, we assume a realist
approach to factor modeling and describe steps for establish-
ing construct validity.
Establishing Construct Validity With Factor Models
Indicator selection. Once researchers have clarified their mea-
surement approach, indicator selection is the next step in estab-
lishing construct validity via factor modeling. Importantly,
modeling assumptions carry with them implications for how
indicators may be selected. Most researchers employing factor
models probably recognize the assumption that factors cause
indicators allows us to estimate properties of latent variables
and attenuate them for measurement error, revealing ``true''
score variance (Cohen et al., 1990). In contrast, composites and
indices are not attenuated for measurement error. Fewer may be
aware that this causal assumption also implies that the indica-
tors in the reflective factor model are interchangeable. That is,
the parameters of latent variables with reflective indicators can
be invariant to which specific indicators are included in the
model (Bollen & Lennox, 1991; Hayduk, Cummings, Boadu,
Pazderka-Robinson, & Boulianne, 2007). In contrast, composites
Richardson et al. 3
and indices are determined by their indicators and so their
parameters are dependent on which variables are used to form
them. This distinction extends to estimates of the effects
between constructs. For composites, consistency in such
effects across studies depends on the operationalization of
the construct, or which variables are used in the forming pro-
cess, while a variety of reflective indicators can be used to
measure latent constructs and achieve such consistency.
Simulation research indicates that when confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) is used, researchers can locate the correct latent
variable with as few as three indicators or two indicators, when
they provide broad coverage of the construct space and reflect
the construct to the same extent (Little, Lindenberger, & Nes-
selroade, 1999). Indeed, with some information from prior
research and/or a very strong theory, a single indicator may
be used (Hayduk & Littvay, 2012). This implies that the task
of selecting invariant indicators of LHS should not be too oner-
ous. If a variety of such indicators is identified, life history
researchers can avoid a troublesome outcome of operational-
ism--variance in findings across labs that is due to differences
in the way constructs are operationalized. Instead, researchers
in different labs may employ varying selections of indicators
and as consistent relationships between construct estimates
emerge, become increasingly confident in the nature of LHS.
Thus, we see no reason why researchers should all opt to use
the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB) or the Mini-K.
Indeed, variations in the instrumentation and vantages used
by multiple independent labs are important for protecting
against researcher bias that may occur in the context of study
design (e.g., method or measurement bias; Spector, 2006), pop-
ulation identification and sampling, interviewing and docu-
mentation, and citation of previous studies (Pannucci &
Wilkins, 2010).
Exploratory versus confirmatory models. It may seem as though
psychometric research on human LHS has already established
indicators that provide valid measurement as well as estab-
lished that LHS is unidimensional. However, most extant
studies (e.g., Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo, Vasquez,
Brumbach, & Schneider, 2007; Gladden, Figueredo, &
Jacobs, 2009; Gladden, Welch, Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2009;
Sefcek & Figueredo, 2010) have been exploratory in that they
used exploratory factor analysis (EFA), an approach that
assumes indicators reflect common factors but specifies no
structure in advance. Although it is possible to obtain a w2
test in the context of EFA (e.g., in MPlus), researchers have
generally not used tests or indices of model fit to the data
when conducting these analyses. Thus, EFA studies have been
useful for data reduction (i.e., simplifying the world) and
exploring structure but less so for theory testing. One impor-
tant implication of this reliance on EFA is that by and large,
we do not yet know whether higher order slow LHS or
K-factors, or Super-K factors for that matter, are consistent
with the data. That is, we do not know whether such higher
order factors provide greater parsimony without compromis-
ing model correspondence to observations. Indeed, Copping
et al. (2014) reported that, in a study using Giosan's (2006)
HKSS, a second-order factor model actually fit the data sig-
nificantly worse than a first-order model with intercorrelated
factors. It is not yet clear whether models that include higher
order factors fit Mini-K or ALHB data as well as those with-
out. This is an important area for future research because this
sort of confirmatory testing could lead researchers to deter-
mine that there is no K-factor after all.
Measurement invariance. Once researchers have selected indica-
tors on the basis of theory and shown that their factor model is
consistent with the data, they can proceed to establish that their
measure is widely useful or measures its construct with invar-
iance to setting and population. In addition to addressing the
use of psychometric versus biometric indicators, Figueredo
et al. (2015) made an extensive case (providing illustrative
examples along the way) that life history measurement is com-
plicated by myriad variables that moderate the effects between
individuals' strategies and the indicators used to measure them.
Importantly, this is a problem that has received extensive atten-
tion in the methodological literature, where it is known as
differential item functioning (DIF) or metric variance (Bollen,
1989; Borsboom, 2006; Brown, 2006; Kline, 2011; Zumbo,
2007). DIF occurs when a construct's effects on its indicators
depend on or vary across levels of other variables (e.g., sex,
ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status [SES], etc.). This metric
variance implies that the construct may not have the same iden-
tity across such variables. At least partial measurement invar-
iance is required to establish the equivalence of the construct
(Brown, 2006). Importantly, measurement invariance testing is
noticeably absent from research on human LHS, leaving the
possibility that no single life history construct exists across
subgroups of people within populations. This is striking, given
Figueredo et al. (2015) themselves pointed out the importance of
using the same metric for comparing the sexes (p. 309).
Stemming from the above, one serious concern we have
regarding the psychometric study of human LHS is that an
ever-increasing list of moderators of the effects of LHS on its
indicators and other constructs will cause people to lose inter-
est. This may be a very real possibility--it has occurred in other
areas of science. In research testing the contact hypothesis
(Allport, 1954), so many facilitators (i.e., moderators) of con-
tact effects were being identified that the field became con-
cerned the theory had become unfalsifiable (Pettigrew, 1998).
Researchers began to think that contact effects might not gen-
eralize past the immediate situation. To avoid this outcome,
researchers need to establish the essential manifestations of
LHS or the indicators that are invariant to the broader models
in which they are embedded. Without establishing this, no
unique identity can be ascribed to LHS (Edwards & Bagozzi,
2000). In addition, researchers need to establish which indica-
tors reflect construct(s) with invariance across contexts and
groups of people. Without establishing this, we cannot be sure
that LHS is broadly useful (Brown, 2006).
Directly relevant to the above, life history research has very
recently applied something similar to nonlinear factor analysis
4 Evolutionary Psychology
(see McDonald, 1967) to LHS measurement (e.g., Woodley
et al., 2015). In these models, which have been termed contin-
uous parameter estimation models following a theoretical
exposition by Gorsuch (2005), the LHS construct's effects on
its indicators decrease as factor scores increase. The theory
driving these studies is that life history traits covary to a lesser
extent among higher K strategists because they are character-
ized by greater phenotypic plasticity (Woodley et al., 2015). No
doubt this theory is intriguing, but because the newly devel-
oped approach employed by Woodley et al. (2015) provides no
test or index of model fit to the data, it is not yet clear that
nonlinear models explain the relationships among life history
traits better than linear ones.
The theoretical development described above is also a bit of
a departure from prior research on human LHS. If correct,
Woodley et al.'s (2015) model presumably implies that
between construct estimates based on previous linear models
were biased. And, the new model seems to run the risk of
making the application of LHT to humans even more unwieldy
in that not only is there a laundry list of factors that might
moderate LHS factor loadings, but these loadings are also not
invariant across its distribution. However, if methodological
research bears out the utility of the continuous parameter esti-
mation model and substantive studies bear out the nonlinear
relationships between LHS and its indicators, our prescription
for moving forward is the same. It will be critical to establish
measurement invariance for at least a subset of life history
indicators. We are not aware of any reason why moderated
nonlinear factor analysis (Curran et al., 2014) could not be used
to tackle the hypothesis that LHS has nonlinear effects on its
indicators, as well as test for measurement invariance, given
that it provides tests of model fit.
Finally, we wish to stress that we are not arguing that life
history research must proceed exclusively via factor modeling.
Other potentially useful approaches are available. For instance,
a network approach could also be applied to understand the
effects between indicators (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). We
do see many benefits to the use of CFA models (e.g., measure-
ment invariance testing and attenuation of constructs for mea-
surement error). If these models are used in a realist sense,
researchers need to begin articulating a precise identity for the
latent slow LHS or K-factor variables, one that can be reason-
ably thought of as invariant to other variables that are modeled
and also population sampled. While many variables may mod-
erate the effects of LHS, it is important that we identify at least
some indicators that manifest invariantly to protect ourselves
from circular reasoning or advancing an unfalsifiable theory.
Where Are We Now?
Methodological limitations aside, a promising literature on
human LHS has emerged. Researchers have selected psycho-
metric indicators of LHS and, as mentioned above, largely
attempted to establish construct validity via EFA. When
factor models are used, dimensionality typically implies
that indicators share common causes on some level. As
mentioned, past research seems to bear out the existence of
a single fast to slow life history (LH) spectrum between spe-
cies (Chisholm, 1993); most discussions of individual differ-
ences in human LHS attend to a single dimension of variation
in life history indicators; and a number of studies have found
that a second-order K-factor subsumed indicators such as
planning and control, social contact and support, attachment,
religiosity, and altruism (for a review, see Olderbak et al.,
2014). Recently, LHS has been broadened to a third-order
Super-K factor that subsumes the second-order K-factor along
with covitality (i.e., health and mental health) and the general
factor of personality (which encompasses the Big Five
personality traits; Olderbak et al., 2014). These findings sug-
gest that on some level, a single source of variation gives rise
to the covariation among life history indicators. Consonantly,
our discussion hitherto has followed prior literature in
assuming such unidimensionality. As a reminder, however,
this assumption has been subjected to few confirmatory tests
and more detailed statistical analysis is required to validate
this assumption.
In addition to the lack of confirmatory evidence favoring a
single LHS dimension, there may be empirical and theoretical
grounds for questioning the existence of a single fast­slow
dimension. An assumption accompanying LHS models with a
single higher order dimension is that lower levels on this factor
correspond to greater endorsement of mating competition (e.g.,
mating effort, dominance-seeking, and risk-taking). This is
because according to LHT, the finite nature of resources
induces phenotypic trade-offs (see Mace, 2000; Stearns,
1989) such that investments in slow LHS (i.e., somatic and
parental effort) occur at the expense of mating competition
(Figueredo et al., 2006). Despite some consensus that there is
a life history continuum within humans, particularly relating to
developmental tempo (Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm, 1993),
empirical research has not consistently found a single dimen-
sion that subsumes the wider documented variation in human
LH traits, including individual differences in personality and
behavior. For example, Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009)
found that during adolescence, a single dimension did not sub-
sume LH traits and only a social deviance dimension emerged
to explain substantial variance in delinquency and drug use.
Brumbach et al. (2009) also reported that uncorrelated latent
variables representing social deviance and slow LHS subsumed
LH traits during young adulthood. Young adult LHS mani-
fested as health, sexual restrictedness, and resource accruing
potential, while social deviance manifested as delinquency,
Machiavellianism, alcohol use, and impulsivity. The authors
suggested that LHS might canalize into a single dimension later
in middle adulthood. Consistent with Brumbach et al. (2009),
Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swoboda (2014) found
that not all indicators of young adult LHS reflected one life
history dimension. In particular, health and neuroticism did not
reflect an LHS variable that subsumed mating effort, delin-
quency, and liability to greater substance use. Very recently,
Richardson et al. (2016) reproduced these findings in
adolescence.
Richardson et al. 5
In other studies, low levels on K-factors have corre-
sponded to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of
health, altruism, conscientiousness, parental investment, and
earning potential (Figueredo et al., 2007), but they have not
necessarily implied greater mating effort (Gladden, Figuer-
edo, et al., 2009; Olderbak & Figueredo, 2012; but see
Figueredo et al., 2005). Recently, Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf,
and Figueredo (2014) found that mating effort did not reflect
four of the five K-factors, which subsumed five different
measures of LHS (i.e., Super-K-1, ALHB, Mini-K, and
HKSS, but not Super-K-2). Moreover, Figueredo, Gladden,
and Hohman (2011) reported that instead, mating effort was
subsumed by a latent variable named psychopathic and
aggressive attitudes. Consonantly, Jonason, Norman, Li, and
Schmidtt (2009) linked the dark triad (subsuming psychopa-
thy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism; Jonason & Webster,
2010) to mating effort indicators, including number of sexual
partners. From this body of work alone, the relationship
between mating effort and K-factors remains unclear.
Consistent with the findings discussed above, Richardson
et al. (2014) suggested that perhaps mating competition varies
uniquely from the K dimension that subsumes delay of repro-
duction, somatic effort, and parenting effort. Complementing
this conception, cross-cultural research on perceptions of the
reproductive strategies of literary characters revealed two
inversely related but unique dimensions representing high-
parental effort, long-term strategies and high mating-effort, and
high-risk strategies (Kruger et al., 2015). Holtzman and Senne
(2014) have argued that a two-dimensional model of human
LHS should be employed on the basis of findings that mating
orientation is not unidimensional but rather reflects two rela-
tively independent factors--short- and long-term mating orien-
tations (Holtzman & Strube, 2013; Jackson & Kirkpatrick,
2007; Webster & Bryan, 2007). Moreover, Fisher (2011) pro-
vided a review of biochemical, genetic, demographic, and indi-
vidual differences data that converge to indicate that some
humans engage in lifelong or serial monogamy in conjunction
with clandestine adultery. Following Gangestad and Simpson
(2000; see also Fisher, 2009), Jonason et al. (2009) similarly
suggested that like mating strategies (short-term vs. long-term),
life strategies (selfish vs. altruistic) might be orthogonal or take
on pluralistic forms. Perhaps high levels on mating competition
and K-factors can co-occur and LHS is not just multidimen-
sional at the first-order level (i.e., the level of traits like con-
scientiousness as discussed in Figueredo et al., 2015), but also
at higher order levels.
Research on pathological and normal personality also sug-
gests that a two-dimensional structure of life history traits is
plausible. In this literature, liability to externalization has sub-
sumed many of the Brumbach et al.'s (2009) social deviance
variables and also those listed by Figueredo et al. (2011; e.g.,
Krueger, Markon, Patrick, Benning, & Kramer, 2007). In addi-
tion, many externalizing constructs such as psychopathy, delin-
quency, and antisocial behavior (Figueredo et al., 2011; Glenn
& Raine, 2009; Harris, Rice, Hilton, Lalumiere, & Quinsey,
2007); substance use (Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2011), and
impulsivity and sensation seeking (Robbins & Bryan, 2004)
have been linked to or subsumed sexual behavior and other
indicators of mating effort and success. These findings suggest
that perhaps liability to externalization (including social
deviance) and mating competition are interchangeable. Simi-
larly, perhaps the Super-K factor represents the inverse of
internalization, consistent with findings that higher levels on
this construct imply greater mental and physical health (i.e.,
covitality; Figueredo et al., 2007).
There are several reasons why mating competition and K- or
Super-K factors might only be loosely related. First, indepen-
dence between mating competition and the K-factor might be
possible due to compartmentalization in the expression of mat-
ing competition and the K-factor. These dimensions might not
be directly related because the former occurs in out-group con-
texts (e.g., exploration and acquisition of resources), while the
latter occurs within one's group or family (e.g., pair-bonding
and parental effort). Second, there is some reason to question
whether the finite nature of resources imposes many important
life history trade-offs on modern humans. Many human invest-
ments (e.g., automobiles, houses, status-bearing occupations,
and physical fitness) may simultaneously lend themselves to
success in mating effort and also success in somatic and par-
ental effort. As Figueredo et al. noted, modern medicine, birth
control, nutrition, extrasomatic wealth, and other aspects of
modern environments may also help decouple mating compe-
tition from the K-factor (for discussions of how life history
trade-offs may be contingent on factors such as access to
resources and environmental conditions, see Mace, 2000; Sibly
& Brown, 2007, 2009; Stearns, 1989). Importantly, we note
that environmental moderation of trade-offs is a distinct issue
from environmental effects on LHS dimensions. That is,
aspects of modern environments might decouple LHS dimen-
sions (i.e., dampen their intercorrelations) but still impact them
as predicted by psychosocial acceleration theory.
We note that if true, these possibilities would not necessarily
imply that there is not a within humans fast­slow life history
continuum, as mating competition and K- or Super-K factors
might be weakly but negatively correlated directly or through
their dependence on general environmental conditions (e.g.,
unpredictability). However, this would imply that there is not
a single LHS construct that could be measured and scored to
capture where people fall from fast to slow. If this were the
case, there would be important implications for life history
research. For instance, the fast­slow theoretical framework
could not be applied to a single life history dimension in a very
straightforward manner because someone with a high score on
a K- or Super-K factor might also score highly on mating
competition. Importantly, this implication would hold regard-
less of one's philosophical position regarding the ontology of
latent variables.
Finally, LHT has been extrapolated from between-species
comparisons to within-species variation. Although it seems
plausible that the finite nature of resources imposes trade-offs
at the within- and between-species levels, it is not clear that this
implies the same structure of life history traits between and
6 Evolutionary Psychology
within species. Importantly, this issue has been addressed in
discussions of the assumption of local homogeneity (i.e., mod-
els have the same form between and within subjects) and there
is evidence that this assumption may hold infrequently (Bors-
boom, 2006; Borsboom et al., 2003; Ellis & Van den Wollen-
berg, 1993). Critiques of evolutionary theories conflating
structure within and between individuals help illustrate this
point (e.g., Kanazawa's Savanah-IQ hypothesis; see Bors-
boom & Dolan, 2006; Penke et al., 2011). The implication
is that research on human LHS needs to confirm the structure
of life history traits and then test whether it is the same
between and within species (e.g., as described by Adolf,
Schuurman, Borkenau, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2014). Similarly,
it is important to carry out invariance testing across the sexes,
ethnicities, and cultures.
The Current Study
We have identified a number of areas for improving validity in
research on human LHS. Confirming the structure of life his-
tory indicators is the first step in efforts to put the psychometric
study of human LHS on more solid ground. Until we use con-
firmatory modeling to determine the underlying dimensions
that subsume life history indicators, we cannot be sure which
indicators are most useful or proceed to invariance testing.
Despite evidence consistent with a single fast­slow life history
continuum in humans, emerging research suggests that life
history indicators may reflect two dimensions (i.e., Super-K
and mating competition), though each may coordinate with
environmental conditions as predicted by LHT. Further, Brum-
bach et al. (2009) suggested that life history traits begin to
reflect a single dimension in middle adulthood. However, no
study has used middle adult data and a model that allows life
history indicators to reflect Super-K and also mating competi-
tion. Additional research is needed to confirm the dimension-
ality of life history indicators throughout development,
especially in light of recent critiques of the psychological mea-
sures of LHS that have stemmed from differential K theory
(e.g., Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; but also see Fig-
ueredo et al., 2015). Here we use nationally representative,
longitudinal data to clarify the structure of middle adult life
history indicators. If underlying life history dimensions fit the
data, we test whether they reflect environmental conditions as
predicted by psychosocial acceleration theory (Belsky et al.,
1991; Chisholm, 1999).
Method
Richardson et al. (2014) suggested that relatively independent
mating competition and K dimensions might subsume LH
traits in the later portion of young adulthood and persist into
middle adulthood. In this study, we tested for these two
dimensions in middle adulthood using SEM with bifactor
models (Chen, West, & Sousa, 2006) and nationally represen-
tative longitudinal data. We also tested whether childhood
environmental conditions including unpredictability, parental
harshness (both defined below), and SES predicted dimen-
sions of middle adult LHS. We conducted these tests to deter-
mine whether the predictions of LHT held for all higher order
LHS variables. The inclusion of SES also allowed us to
address the possibility that trade-offs between LHS dimen-
sions occur only within the levels of access to resources
(e.g., see Sibly & Brown, 2007, 2009).
The Bifactor Model
Past CFA studies of human LHS relied on the second-order
factor model (see Figure 1), which includes overarching or
general constructs (e.g., K- or Super-K factors) that subsume
individual first-order constructs (e.g., warmth of relationships
with parents). Importantly, these models specify the residual
variances in first-order constructs (i.e., that unexplained by
overarching factors) as orthogonal to second-order factors and
usually other first-order factors as well. Moreover, these resi-
duals are usually ignored (Chen et al., 2006). But researchers
are sometimes interested in general factors and also the factors
that explain unique variance in domains over and above that
explained by general factors. For instance, they may want to
predict outcomes like academic achievement with general fac-
tors such as intelligence and also unique variances in domains
like verbal ability. Researchers may also simply wish to esti-
mate the effects of general and also domain-specific factors on
items, or determine if there are actually domain-specific factors
at all after accounting for the general factor. Indeed, the
absence of domain-specific variance in second-order models
often goes unnoticed (Chen et al., 2006).
As discussed above, it is not clear that Super-K subsumes
mating effort and other indicators of mating competition (e.g.,
risk-taking). One possibility is that mating competition is rel-
evant to a narrow band of life history traits that generally vary
with independence from the Super-K and its domains.
Another possibility is that mating competition varies uniquely
from Super-K but also subsumes variance in its domains. For
instance, extroversion could reflect effort expended to influ-
ence people for reasons related to Super-K (e.g., maintaining
social relationships and reciprocal transactions) and also mat-
ing effort (as noted by MacDonald, 1995). Moreover, invest-
ment in health and thereby attractiveness (Nedelec & Beaver,
2014) could produce benefits relevant to Super-K (e.g., long life
span conducive to investment in offspring) and also mating
competition (e.g., more sexual partners). In attempts to examine
such possibilities, life history researchers may find the bifactor
model (see Figure 1) useful, given that it allows them to estimate
the effects of Super-K on its indicators and also examine how
variance in life history indicators that is not explained by Super-
K may reflect other constructs or dimensions.1
Data
This study analyzed publicly available national data from the
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS; n ¼ 4,244).2 The
MIDUS survey investigated the role of behavioral,
Richardson et al. 7
psychological, and social factors in accounting for age-related
variations in health and well-being. The data are longitudinal
with two rounds (1995­1996 and 2004­2006). During Round
1, participants in our analytic sample were aged 24­74 years (m
¼ 46.44) and 50.8% were male. Further, the racial/ethnic com-
position of the sample was 83% White, 10.6% African Amer-
ican, 1.6% Native American or Aleutian Islander/Eskimo,
0.7% multiracial, and 2.2% other. Finally, 88.6% graduated
high school, 7.4% graduated from a 2-year college or voca-
tional school with an associate's degree, 17.7% graduated col-
lege with a bachelor's or master's degree, and 3.9% earned a
doctoral degree. Sixty-five percent of the Round 1 sample par-
ticipated during Round 2. For more information about the
MIDUS samples, please visit http://www.midus.wisc.edu/
midus1/index.php. Because attrition was a concern, we con-
ducted a missing data analysis. We observed evidence that the
missing completely at random assumption (MCAR) for listwise
deletion was inappropriate (e.g., several indicators of child-
hood environment predicted missingness on the substance use
items), found the more relaxed assumption of missing at ran-
dom plausible (Little & Rubin, 2002), used multiple imputation
and generated five3 imputed data sets using the NORM Version
2.03 package for Windows (Schafer, 1997).
Instruments
We used LHT to select 19 Round 2 indicators of middle adult
LHS and 3 Round 1 retrospective indicators of childhood
environment. We selected life history indicators that have been
observed to reflect a broad set of LHS domains in prior research
(for a review, see Olderbak et al., 2014) and also chose envi-
ronmental indicators that have been previously studied (for a
review, see Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009).
Based on the literature to date, we note the hypothesized
valence of each LHS indicator loading in Table 1. We mea-
sured the 19 selected life history indicators and constructed
three environmental components using 73 and 22 items,4
respectively. A major strength of the MIDUS survey was the
large selection of measures employed. The survey developers
used well-validated scales and also carried out extensive pilot
research to develop short-form assessments of many psycho-
social constructs along with condensed assessment inventories.
Where possible, we included scale scores computed by the
survey developers as factor indicators. We also attempted to
include any other available items that reflected our constructs
theoretically or empirically. A full list of the items and scale
scores we selected is presented in Table 2, along with their
MIDUS labels, the constructs they measured, and their con-
tents. All scale scores computed by the survey developers are
marked ``computed by the survey developers.'' For further
information about these scales, including their a coefficients
for the MIDUS samples and also references to validation stud-
ies, please access the MIDUS I and II scales information at
http://www.midus.wisc.edu/midus1/index.php and http://
www.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/project1/.
Below we describe all indicators used to measure middle
adult LHS as well as index childhood environment. Because
this study used a very large number of LHS indicators, we do
not provide a detailed theoretical rationale for the inclusion of
each one in this report. Instead, we provide citations to reviews
of life history measures or other publications where the use of
each life history indicator is substantiated. We also do not
present psychometrics associated with each indicator in this
section. Because of the computational demands associated with
using SEM to examine 95 categorical and continuous variables,
we conducted a preliminary analysis to assess items for uni-
dimensionality and also compute scores for use in our structural
models. These procedures are described in Analyses section,
and the psychometric properties of our LHS indicators are
summarized in Results section and presented in Table 2.
Indicators of middle adult LHS
Super-K. We measured Super-K (i.e., the general factor)
using measures of the Big Five (i.e., agreeableness, openness
to experience, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extrover-
sion; Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach,
& Schneider, 2004, 2007; Olderbak et al., 2014), physical and
mental health (Figueredo & Rushton, 2009; Olderbak et al.,
2014), positive affect (Olderbak et al., 2014), education
(Griskevicius, Tybur, Delton, & Robertson, 2011; Richardson,
Castellano, Stone, & Sanning, 2016), pair-bonding (Olderbak
& Figueredo, 2010), sexuality,5 number of children (Chisholm,
1999; Griskevicius et al., 2011), neighborhood quality (Ellis
et al., 2009), and social closeness/support (Olderbak et al.,

2014). We also extended upon the findings reported by
Richardson et al. (2014, 2016) by regressing liability to sub-
stance use on Super-K.
Mating competition. This study measured mating competition
using risk-taking (Ellis et al., 2012; Figueredo et al., 2005),
aggression (Figueredo et al., 2005), number of sex partners
(Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, & Swoboda, 2014), sexual-
ity, pair-bonding (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2010), number of
children (Chisholm, 1999; Griskevicius et al., 2011), number
of marriages (Jokela, Rotkirch, Rickard, Pettay, & Lummaa,
2010), and social closeness/support (Olderbak et al., 2014). We
also attempted to replicate the findings reported by Richardson
et al. (2014, 2016) by regressing liability to substance use on
mating competition.
Liability to substance use and abuse. Given the theoretical
linkage between LHS and substance use developed by Richard-
son and Hardesty (2012), along with empirical findings indi-
cating that life history dimensions subsumed adolescent and
young adult liabilities to substance use (Gibbons et al., 2012;
Hampson, Andrews, Barckley, Gerrard, & Gibbons, 2016;
Richardson et al., 2014, 2016), we included a measure of lia-
bility to substance use/abuse in this study (as mentioned pre-
viously). This allowed us to test whether the prior findings
extended to middle adulthood. We measured liability to sub-
stance use/abuse with indicators including tobacco use (smok-
ing), alcohol use and abuse, illicit drug use, and illicit drug
abuse. We used 10 items to measure alcohol use and abuse,
10 to measure breadth in illicit drug use (summed to form an
index), and 7 items to measure illicit drug abuse (for descrip-
tions of all these items, see Table 2).
Childhood environment
Environmental unpredictability. This was indexed using items
that have been theoretically related to temporal variation in
morbidity­mortality (Ellis et al., 2009) and previously used
to form this construct (e.g., see Brumbach, Figueredo, & Ellis,
2009). These included 6 items assessing the number of times
participants moved to new neighborhood, ever experienced that
their family went on welfare, were ever homeless, or had par-
ents who divorced. The unpredictability index also included 2
items that assessed the consistency of rules set by participants'
mothers and fathers (4-point scale ranging from never to a lot).
Environmental harshness.
Harsh parenting: Abusive, unsupportive child-rearing
can be an important cue to extrinsic morbidity­mor-
tality or environmental harshness (for a review, see
Ellis et al., 2009). We assessed harsh parenting as
experience of emotional abuse by mother, emotional
abuse by father, physical abuse by mother, physical
abuse by father, severe physical abuse by mother, and
severe physical abuse by father (all 4-point items rang-
ing from not at all to a lot).
SES: SES is another important cue to environmental
harshness (Ellis et al., 2009) and is traditionally
indexed by forming a composite of indicators such
as parental income, educational attainment, and occu-
pational status (National Center for Education Statis-
tics, 2012). In this study, we indexed SES using father
and mother SES indices created by the survey devel-
opers and also items that assessed respondents' per-
ceived financial level growing up (6-point item
ranging from a lot worse off than average to a lot
better off) and self-reported highest educational levels
achieved by mother and father.

within each imputed data set. Using EFA and Bartlett's method
allowed us to be sure scales were unidimensional and scoring
was thus appropriate, produce unbiased estimates of the true
factor scores (Hershberger, 2005), and avoid sequences of
model modifications (e.g., the addition of error covariances)
that could be required if CFA were applied to all 95 observed
variables and scale scores across the life history domains (we
return to this point in Limitations section). We used SPSS 23 to

factor scales with only continuous items, Promax rotations if
scales were not unidimensional and saved scores for each
dimension that emerged. We chose an oblique rotation (Pro-

use/abuse). Principle components analysis7 was used to con-
struct composite parental harshness and SES. We summed
across indicators of unpredictability to construct composite or
total unpredictability, given that these indicators can vary non-
systematically. Single indicators of Super-K and mating com-
petition were analyzed as they were.
This study used SEM to test the structure of middle adult life
history indicators along with whether middle adult life history
dimensions reflected childhood environment as predicted by
LHT. We used the MPlus Version 7.11 software package to
test our models and used the robust weighted least squares
(WLSMV; Muth´
en, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997) estimator because
we treated variables such as number of sexual partners and
number of marriages as ordinal.8 Because we analyzed very
large samples that provided a great deal of statistical power, all
significance tests were conducted at the p < .001 level.
Goodness-of-fit criteria. This study used a variety of fit indices in
order to obtain a robust assessment of model fit. We considered
the substantive meaningfulness of the model, Tucker­Lewis
index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) greater than .95
(Byrne, 2001; Hu & Bentler, 1999), and root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .05 (Browne &
Cudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the data. MPlus
Version 7.11 provides average fit indices and an average w2
likelihood ratio statistic (Kline, 2011) when multiple imputed
sets are analyzed using WLSMV but not a pooled likelihood
ratio test. As mentioned, we observed modification indices
across the imputed sets to identify sources of misfit to the data.
Hypothesized models
Model I. We first hypothesized a bifactor model in which all
indicators of Super-K (described above) reflected a single
latent variable (i.e., the general factor). Further, the model
included domain-specific personality and covitality factors that
represented the variance in the five factors of personality and
health and mental health, respectively, not explained by Super-
K (the general factor). We also specified all indicators of mat-
ing competition as reflecting a common factor and examined
whether the variance in the domain-specific personality and
covitality factors (i.e., that unexplained by Super-K) reflected
mating competition by regressing the former on the latter.
Building on findings (e.g., Richardson et al., 2014, 2016) that
liability to greater substance use reflected life history dimen-
sions, we regressed liability to substance use/abuse on mating
competition and also Super-K. We specified residual covar-
iances between alcohol use and abuse, and between illicit drug
use and abuse, given that we expected associations between
these constructs that were not explained by common liability
to substance use/abuse. We also examined modification indices
to discover any direct effects of mating competition on the Big
Five as well as identify any cross-loadings of Super-K indica-
tors on mating competition and vice versa. Finally, we
observed the correlation between the Super-K factor and mat-
ing competition for evidence they reflected the same
underlying dimension (i.e., a moderate or large correlation
would suggest that we needed to test a unidimensional model).
Model II. If Model I fit the data well, we specified a second
model that included our environmental constructs (Model II).
Drawing upon LHT, research driven by psychosocial accelera-
tion theory, and our discussion of the dimensionality of LHS,
we hypothesized that (a) harsh parenting and unpredictability
would predict greater mating competition and lower levels on
Super-K in middle adulthood, while (b) higher SES would
predict greater mating competition and Super-K levels. The
hypothesized SES effect on mating competition, which may
seem surprising, was rooted in the finding that access to
resources corresponds to higher levels on r and also K strate-
gies between species (e.g., Sibly & Brown, 2007, 2009). We
encoded these hypotheses into Model II and regressed the
domain-specific factors, along with liability to substance use/
abuse, on the environmental dimensions, given that it was
unlikely that mating competition and Super-K mediated all
environmental effects on personality and behavior, and also
given that past research has linked substance use/abuse to envi-
ronmental dimensions (Ronel & Haimoff-Ayali, 2010).
Finally, we specified a covariance between childhood SES and
the middle adult neighborhood quality residual because
research suggests that parent SES is a robust correlate of off-
spring SES (Griskevicius et al., 2011).
Results
As mentioned, we carried out preliminary factor analyses to
compute scores for the life history and environmental domains
within each imputed set. The results of these analyses are
detailed in Table 2, which includes loadings for all items and
scores that reflected factors or were used to form composites.
Across the imputed sets, all items and scores loaded on their
factor or component at b ¼ .30 or above. Table 2 illustrates the
patterns of loadings with estimates from Imputation 1. All life
history indicators were unidimensional except alcohol use/
abuse and parental harshness. Two factors subsumed the alco-
hol items--alcohol use and alcohol abuse (r ¼ .40). We com-
puted and saved scores for both factors and included them in
our structural models. Two components emerged from the par-
ental harshness items--mother harshness and father harshness
(r ¼ .50). We computed scores on these two components and
included their average in our structural models. Below we
describe the results of our SEM analyses.
Model I
We tested our first hypothesized model (Model I) and it was
overidentified with 187 degrees of freedom. Fit indices (see
Table 3) suggested that the model did not fit the data well
(w2 ¼ 4,725.58, CFI ¼ .86, TLI ¼ .82, RMSEA ¼ .08) and
should be rejected. We first examined the model for misspe-
cification as evidenced by nonsignificant factor loadings. We
observed that the effects of mating competition on social
support (p ¼ .57) and number of marriages (p ¼ .75) were
12 Evolutionary Psychology
nonsignificant. We thus removed these parameters and did
not include number of marriages in any further analyses
because modification indices did not suggest that it was
related to any other factors. We then carried out a sequence
of modifications to the model on the basis of large modifica-
tion indices (i.e., >100) and theoretical rationale (i.e., there
was a substantive basis for each change). Modifications
ceased when no potential changes met both of these criteria.
As we carried out the sequence of changes, any factor
loadings that became nonsignificant were removed. We note
that though this study was confirmatory in nature, the need
for model modifications was not surprising, given the very
large number of constructs under study. Table 3 displays
each modification and the corresponding improvement in fit
to the data. The theoretical rationale for each change is
provided in the Online Supplementary Materials. After
carrying out the tabled modifications, we found that the
resulting model fit the data well, w2(154) ¼ 4,725.58,
CFI ¼ .96, TLI ¼ .94, RMSEA ¼ .04. Strikingly, we
observed that mating competition and Super-K were uncor-
related (r ¼ À.02, p ¼ .12).
Model II
Next, we specified Model II by including our environmental
variables as a part of the model to be estimated. This model had
202 degrees of freedom and fit the data marginally well (w2 ¼
1,959.59, CFI ¼ .945, TLI ¼ .93, RMSEA ¼ .05). As a remin-
der, this model included environmental effects on all latent
variables as well as a covariance between childhood SES and
the middle adult neighborhood quality residual. Consistent
with past research (Griskevicius et al., 2011), the latter was
observed at r ¼ .54. Modification indices suggested that
aggression should also be regressed on childhood SES. This
effect was consistent with prior research linking lower child-
hood SES to greater antisociality (Piotrowska, Stride, Croft, &
Rowe, 2015). We added this parameter and the resulting model
had 201 degrees of freedom and fit the data reasonably well
(w2 ¼ 1,874.54, CFI ¼ .95, TLI ¼ .93, RMSEA ¼ .04).9
LHS indicators. Our next step was examining the magnitude of
the factor loadings (see Figure 2 and Table 4, and for a graphic
that displays loadings only, see Online Supplementary
Materials). The Super-K factor's final 14 indicators were
health/mental health, neuroticism (À), extroversion, agreeable-
ness, conscientiousness, openness to experience, positive
affect, social support, aggression (À), neighborhood quality,
education, pair-bonding, sexuality, and # of children. Standar-
dized factor loadings ranged from b ¼ .07 (# of children) to .76
(social support). Loadings equal to or above .30 were consid-
ered evidence, suggesting that indicators provided sufficiently
valid measurement of their constructs. The loadings for health/
mental health, neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness, con-
scientiousness, openness to experience, positive affect, social
support, aggression (À), education, and pair-bonding satisfied
this criterion. The loadings for neighborhood quality, sexuality,
and number of children were below .30.
We also regressed liability to substance use/abuse on Super-
K in an attempt to extend the findings (e.g., Richardson et al.,
2014, 2016) that substance use reflects life history dimensions
to middle adulthood. We found that Super-K had a moderate
negative effect on liability to substance use/abuse (b ¼ À.43),
which did not subsume alcohol abuse holding mating compe-
tition constant. This implied that alcohol abuse was not scalar
invariant as an indicator of liability to substance use. Super-K
was unrelated to alcohol abuse. In the end, our findings suggest
that 12 indicators (i.e., health/mental health, neuroticism,
extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to

tion, pair-bonding, and liability to substance use/abuse) may
provide valid measurement of Super-K in future research,
while four others (i.e., neighborhood quality, sexuality, # of
children, and alcohol abuse) may not.
For the domain-specific personality variable, the final indi-
cators were extroversion, agreeableness, openness to experi-
ence, conscientiousness, and pair-bonding (À). Loadings
ranged from b ¼ .36 (pair-bonding) to .72 (openness). For the
domain-specific covitality factor, the final indicators were
health/mental health, neuroticism (À), positive affect, agree-
ableness (À), neighborhood quality, and aggression (À). Load-
ings ranged from b ¼ .11 (agreeableness) to .67 (health/mental
health) and only health/mental health and neuroticism had
loadings above b ¼ .30.
For mating competition, the final indicators were # of sexual
partners, sexuality, risk-taking, aggression, # of children (À),
pair-bonding, neighborhood quality, agreeableness (À), and
(À) neuroticism,. Loadings ranged from b ¼ .14 (neighborhood
quality) to .48 (aggression). The loadings for six indicators
appeared to be equal to or greater than .30: # of sexual partners,
sexuality, risk-taking, pair-bonding, aggression, and agreeable-
ness (À). By comparison, # of children, neighborhood quality,
and neuroticism did not seem to adequately reflect their factor.
However, we note that we regressed the domain-specific covi-
tality and personality factors onto mating competition to test
Figure 2. Final model of life history strategy indicators.

whether variance in the indicators of these two factors, not
explained by Super-K, was explained by mating competition.
We found that this was indeed the case. The effects of mating
competition on covitality and personality were both moderate
in size (b ¼ .42 and .47, respectively), suggesting that mating
competition was another important source of common varia-
tion in indicators of Super-K. We note that, consistent with our
Model I findings, the covariance between mating competition
and Super-K was nonsignificant (cov ¼ À.004, p ¼ .759; for
covariances and correlations, see Table 5). In an additional step,
we constrained this covariance to 0 to test the hypothesis that the
two dimensions were statistically independent. We found that
model fit was not significantly different across the imputed sets,
for example, Imputation 1: Dw2(1) ¼ .09, p ¼ .76; CFI ¼ .95;
TLI ¼ .93; RMSEA ¼ .04, implying that we should not reject
the hypothesis that the covariance was nil.
Given that mating competition had direct effects as well as
indirect effects through the domain-specific factors on some
life history indicators, we needed to estimate its total effects on
these indicators to better understand its influence. To explain
this further, mating competition could be understood as having
effects common to indicators of the domain-specific factors
through its impact on their factors. However, for some indica-
tors, there was also a direct effect that reflected influence not
common to the other traits. Consistent with this, the direct
(b ¼ .31) and indirect personality mediated (b ¼ À.17) effects
on pair-bonding produced a total effect of b ¼ .15; the direct
(b ¼ À.39) and indirect personality (b ¼ .18) and covitality
(b ¼ À.06) mediated effects on agreeableness produced a total
effect of b ¼ À.27; the direct (b ¼ .14) and indirect covitality-
mediated (b ¼ .08) effects on neighborhood quality produced a
total effect of b ¼ .22; and finally, the direct (b ¼ .19) and

indirect covitality-mediated effects (b ¼ À.18) on neuroticism
produced a nil total effect (p ¼ .824). We also saw that the
indirect effect on aggression was nonsignificant (p ¼ .003) and
therefore the direct and total effects were equal (b ¼ .48). In
light of these findings, we reasoned that the total effect of pair-
bonding was too small to be retained (conceptually) as an ade-
quate indicator of mating competition.
For some indicators of the domain-specific factors, mating
competition had only indirect effects. Specifically, mating
competition had significant indirect effects, but no direct
effects, on extroversion (b ¼ .26), openness to experience
(b ¼ .33), conscientiousness (b ¼ .18), health/mental health
(b ¼ .28), and positive affect (b ¼ .09). Thus, we concluded
that extroversion, openness, and health/mental health might
function as adequate indicators of mating competition. We note
that given the smaller effects of mating competition on positive
affect and neuroticism, relative to health/mental health, the
latter effect may be more attributable to an effect on health
than mental health.
We also regressed liability to substance use/abuse on mating
competition to test whether the findings that substance use
reflects life history dimensions (e.g., Richardson et al., 2014,
2016) extended to middle adulthood. We found that mating
competition had a small to moderate effect on liability to sub-
stance use/abuse (b ¼ .29) and also a moderate effect on alco-
hol abuse (b ¼ .35). As a reminder, alcohol abuse did not reflect
common liability to substance use/abuse, holding mating com-
petition constant. In the end, our findings suggest that 10 indi-
cators (i.e., # of sexual partners, sexuality, risk-taking,
aggression, agreeableness, extroversion, openness, health, alco-
hol abuse, and liability to substance use/abuse) can likely pro-
vide valid measurement of mating competition in future
research, while five others (i.e., # of children, neighborhood
quality, neuroticism, positive affect, and pair-bonding) may not.
Finally, for liability to substance use/abuse, the final indi-
cators were smoking (b ¼ .29), illicit drug use (b ¼ .45), illicit
drug abuse (b ¼ .40), and alcohol use (b ¼ .32). As mentioned,
surprisingly, alcohol abuse did not reflect common liability to
substance use/abuse though it was residually correlated with
alcohol use at r ¼ .30, as expected. This suggested that alcohol
abuse's etiology may be somewhat unique. We return to this
point in our description of the structural regression coefficients
and in Discussion section. Finally, as expected, the illicit drug
use and abuse residuals were correlated at r ¼ .50. These two
correlations implied these variables were associated for reasons
not captured in our SEM. Notably, our model explained 33% of
the variance in common liability to substance use/abuse and
12% of the variance in alcohol abuse.
Environmental effects. After examining latent variable effects on
life history indicators, we moved on to interpret the magnitude
of the environmental effects on our dimensions of middle adult
LHS (see Figure 2 and Table 6). We found that unpredictability
and harsh parenting had small negative effects on Super-K
(both rounded to b ¼ À.18), while childhood SES did not have
a significant effect on this life history dimension. By contrast,
childhood SES and parental harshness had moderate and small
effects on mating competition (b ¼ .43 and .14, respectively),
while the effect of unpredictability on this life history dimen-
sion was nonsignificant.10 This implies that the effects of child-
hood environment on middle adult LHS are not homogeneous.
We return to this point in the Discussion section. Notably, our
model explained 19% of the variance in mating competition but
just 8% of the variance in Super-K.

Childhood SES also had a small effect (b ¼ .12) on the
domain-specific covitality factor and all three environmental
variables had small positive effects on the domain-specific
personality factor (bs ranged from .12 to .14). Thus, there
appear to be multiple pathways by which childhood environ-
ment may impact personality traits and also physical and men-
tal health. Childhood unpredictability had a small direct effect
(b ¼ .17) on liability to substance use/abuse and childhood SES
had a small negative effect (b ¼ À.19) on aggression. We
observed small negative correlations of childhood SES with
unpredictability and parental harshness and a small positive
correlation between unpredictability and harshness. Finally, for
those who may be interested in practical public health and well-
being implications, we tested the indirect effects of the envi-
ronmental variables on each life history indicator closely
related to health promotion and illness prevention efforts and
included a description of these results in the Online Supple-
mentary Materials.
Discussion
This study applied SEM with bifactor models to test the
dimensionality of middle adult LHS indicators drawn from
the MIDUS study. From a factor modeling perspective, con-
firming the dimensionality of human life history indicators is
the first step in placing the psychometric study of human LHS
on more solid ground. The Brumbach et al. (2009) and
Richardson et al. (2014, 2016) findings combine to suggest
that in adolescence and young adulthood, a coherent mating
competition dimension manifests as higher levels on indica-
tors such as antisociality, multipartner sex, aggression, risk-
taking and delinquency, and substance use and abuse. Our
findings suggest that this dimension persists into middle
adulthood, by which time a coherent Super-K factor also sub-
sumes indicators of LHS. As suggested by Richardson et al.
(2016), this Super-K factor may emerge through the norma-
tive process of self-regulatory development.
Our findings strongly suggest that middle adult LHS is not
unidimensional on the second-order level but rather two-
dimensional. Strikingly, mating competition and the Super-K
factor were statistically independent even though childhood
SES was controlled. Although their pattern of correlation
through environmental conditions seems consistent with LHT,
there appears to be no direct trade-off between them and no
single score can locate the LHS of the participants in our sam-
ple. This finding challenges the growing literature that assumes
a single fast­slow dimension (as described in our review) and
also neurobiological models contending that the fast­slow
trade-off occurs at the neural level, such that activity may
generally shift from novelty to familiarity (i.e., internal work-
ing model and attachment related) processing or in the reverse
direction (Tops, Koole, IJzerman, & Buisman-Pijlman, 2014).
Indeed, our findings suggest that some people may be engaged
in both sorts of processing while others are scarcely engaged in
either. This is consistent with the Holtzman and Senne (2014)
argument that a two-dimensional model is more consistent with
the human data and should be employed. While adaptations
may be regulating resource allocations in response to environ-
ment as predicted by LHT, the same proximate mechanisms do
not seem to be governing investment into indicators of mating
competition and Super-K.
Future research should attempt to determine how our find-
ings of statistical independence might be reconciled with LHT.
For instance, researchers could try to identify the factors that

enable some people to invest highly in mating competition and
also Super-K. They could also examine if change in environ-
mental factors over time explains the independence we found.
Perhaps this could explain why early harshness and unpredict-
ability were related to personality, which develops early and
remains reasonably stable, and less related to covitality, which
might be reflecting more recent conditions. Also, more
research, like Kruger et al.'s research (2015), should also be
carried out to determine how people perceive and/or detect
LHS in others. In this vein, it is interesting to note that vari-
ables like substance use/abuse, agreeableness, aggression, and
harsh parenting are inversely related to one LHS dimension
but not the other--humans could use them to infer levels on
both dimensions. Finally, the idea of a fast­slow dimension
seems remarkably intuitive and this in itself might be valuable
to examine. Perhaps it occurs partly because humans focus on
the detection of long-term mates low on mating competition
(i.e., who will not invest resources elsewhere or engage in
cuckoldry) and short-term mates that are ``available'' (i.e.,
without a mate who will mate guard). Similarly, perhaps it
occurs partly because people invested in Super-K benefit from
concealing mating effort from long-term mates and those
invested in mating competition benefit from concealing that
they have a long-term partner.
Our findings suggest 12 indicators (i.e., health/mental
health, neuroticism [À], extroversion, agreeableness, conscien-
tiousness, openness to experience, positive affect, social sup-
port, aggression [À], education, pair-bonding, and liability to
substance use/abuse [À]) may provide valid measurement of
Super-K in future research. These findings are consistent with
past research (e.g., Olderbak et al., 2014). Of course, more
validation studies are needed to confirm this possibility, which
means that it is not yet appropriate to treat these indicators as a
scale. Although they may not provide very good indicators of
Super-K, we note that the effects on neighborhood quality and
sexuality were consistent with LHT, given that (a) selection
into safer and higher quality environments is consistent with
investment in the safe but low-yield decisions that are charac-
teristic of slower LHS (Griskevicius et al., 2011), as well as
parental effort, and (b) sexuality is an important aspect of love
and attachment formation (Mikulincer, 2006).
Higher Super-K levels implied slightly greater numbers of
children, not fewer children as predicted by life history the-
orists studying humans (Figueredo et al., 2005). We note that
in our two-dimensional model, mating competition and
Super-K might both be seen as fitness components and thus
higher levels on both could imply greater numbers of off-
spring. In ancestral environments, the effect of mating com-
petition might have been large while the effect of Super-K
was small, such that very fast strategists (high mating com-
petition and low-K) had the most offspring and very slow
strategists (high-K and low mating competition) had fewer
but higher quality offspring than fast strategists. Notably,
people with the lowest scores on both dimensions would have
had the fewest offspring. Thus, perhaps the availability of
birth control in modern environments disrupts the effect of
mating competition on number of offspring and this tends to
limit childbirth to those who intend to have children because
they want to parent (i.e., higher K people attempt to have
children while lower K, higher mating competition people use
birth control to decouple sexual activity and reproduction). As
another possibility, postdemographic transition parents are
often more isolated from their own parents and kin (Sear,
2015). Perhaps higher K people are more likely to stay near
their families and experience greater stability as a result of
accessible kin networks. In turn, this may facilitate greater
alloparental care, enabling them to comfortably support more
offspring compared with their lower K counterparts. Future
research should test these possibilities by incorporating data
from more traditional populations and examining whether the
same pattern is detected.
Our findings suggest 10 indicators (i.e., # of sexual partners,
sexuality, risk-taking, aggression, agreeableness [À], extrover-
sion, openness, health, alcohol abuse, and liability to substance
use/abuse) may provide valid measurement of mating compe-
tition in future research. These findings are generally consistent
with past research (e.g., Richardson et al., 2014, 2016). It was
notable that mating competition did not have substantial effects
on numbers of marriages and children. The latter likely reflects
the availability of birth control in modern environments.
Although they may not provide great indicators of mating
competition, the positive effects on neighborhood quality and
pair-bonding are notable, given that previous research sug-
gested that greater mating effort, dominance seeking, and
risk-taking should be negatively related to attachment forma-
tion and investment in safe environments that are amenable to
raising children (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006). These findings
combine with the literature we reviewed, along with our find-
ing that mating competition and Super-K were statistically
independent, to provide strong indication that humans engage
in pluralistic survival and reproductive strategies. Again,
more research is needed to attempt to reconcile these findings
with LHT.
We found that indeed, it was important to attend to the
variance in life history indicators not explained by Super-K.
We used bifactor models to accomplish this and the payoff was
information about mating competition's effects on personality
and covitality. Mating competition had substantial positive
effects on extroversion and openness to experience, consistent
with past research (see Holtzman & Senne, 2014) and the
notion that traits such as extroversion could reflect effort
expended to influence people for reasons related to Super-K
and also mating competition. Surprisingly, mating competition
also had a small positive effect on conscientiousness, which
may reflect the fact that some self-regulation and awareness is
needed to influence others, whatever one's motives. Finally,
mating competition had a small to moderate positive effect on
health/mental health. This may reflect the fact that, similar to
income and investment in markers of higher status, health is a
cue to mate value (Nedelec & Beaver, 2014) that can facilitate
mating effort and also extended periods of parental and nepo-
tistic effort.
18 Evolutionary Psychology
Building upon Richardson and Hardesty's (2012) theoretical
synthesis and the subsequent empirical findings that liability to
substance use reflects LHS dimensions (e.g., Richardson et al.,
2014, 2016), we found that middle adult mating competition
and Super-K both appeared to drive liability to substance use/
abuse. However, only mating competition seemed to impact
alcohol abuse, suggesting the etiology of alcohol abuse may
be somewhat unique. This finding may inform future substance
abuse etiology research.
Finally, we found that dimensions of environment did not
have homogeneous effects on the two dimensions of LHS.
Super-K appeared to be directly responsive to childhood unpre-
dictability and parental harshness but not to childhood SES
(though parental harshness and childhood SES were negatively
associated). In contrast, mating competition appeared to be
directly responsive to childhood SES and parental harshness
but not unpredictability. Parental harshness was therefore the
only aspect of childhood environment that could be seen as
cuing a diversion of resources from slower to faster LHS or
vice versa (i.e., from Super-K to mating competition). This
finding is consistent with psychosocial acceleration theory
(e.g., Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm, 1993). In addition, SES
might be seen as having effects consistent with psychosocial
acceleration theory, in that it is possible that harsher parental
practices mediated an indirect effect on mating competition
and Super-K.
Childhood SES and unpredictability appeared to directly
impact only one LHS dimension apiece (i.e., Super-K or mat-
ing competition). These findings suggest that not only do at
least two dimensions subsume LHS indicators, these dimen-
sions do not reflect childhood environment in a homogeneous
manner. This picture of human LHS is more complex but
offers some intriguing avenues for future research. For
instance, our model implies that the fastest strategists (i.e.,
high-mating competition and low Super-K) experienced high
SES, greater unpredictability, and greater parental harshness,
while the slowest strategists experienced low SES, less harsh
parenting, and more predictable childhoods. This seems
inconsistent with the current life history literature, but sug-
gests that those who have the resources may use them to
achieve mating success in addition to investing in safety and
parenting effort. This is also consistent with between-species
findings that access to resources corresponds to higher levels
of r-selected strategies, holding other factors constant (Sibly
& Brown, 2007, 2009). We discuss these SES effects further
in the Future Directions section.
Potential practical implications for public health initiatives
flow from the findings reviewed above. First, high-SES indi-
viduals have been largely neglected as the targets of health
promotion and prevention efforts because they are not viewed
as ``at-risk'' (Humensky, 2010). However, our model suggests
that adults who experienced high SES, harsh parenting, and
unpredictability were more likely to manifest health-relevant
traits and behaviors like risk-taking, substance abuse, and mul-
tipartner sex. Our findings confirm what past research has
implied about the effects of environment on Super-K--those
who experienced harsher parenting and greater unpredictability
were more likely to be characterized by lower Super-K scores
and thus, holding mating competition constant, poorer mental
and physical health, less social support, less educational
attainment, and more severe substance use. Finally, our find-
ings suggest that intervention on middle adult Super-K and
mating competition could produce broad and substantial
improvements in population health and well-being, while
intervention on childhood environment could produce simi-
larly broad but very modest effects (i.e., very small to small).
Of course, such intervention may still be worthwhile from an
economic perspective.
Limitations
This study is limited by the use of self-report data and it is
widely recognized that such data can be affected by error in
the retrieval processes associated with memory and self-
presentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly
to the retrospective childhood measures, but because we are
aware of no data sets that contain measures broadly relevant
to LHT that span from childhood to middle adulthood, we see
the MIDUS data as an important albeit imperfect source of
information about LHS development. Second, causal infer-
ences based on the results presented here should remain ten-
tative. Childhood environment cannot be understood as
completely exogenous to middle adult LHS due to genetic
inheritance. Given that the effects of environmental condi-
tions were all small and that the genetic effects on these
variables as well as the middle adult LHS dimensions could
be as large or larger, genetic confounding is a significant
concern (Barnes, Boutwell, Beaver, Gibson, & Wright,
2014), and future research should use genetic information
to address this limitation. This concern extends to most
research that has estimated environmental effects on life his-
tory indicators or their underlying dimensions. Future
research should employ behavioral genetic designs to control
for genetic confounding when estimating the extent to which
LHS dimensions translate environmental harshness and
unpredictability into life history indicators. Such studies may
provide important information about whether LHS develop-
ment is conditional and/or alternative.
A final limitation that should be considered is that this study
assumed, at least in part, the validity of the many psychological
constructs used as indicators of LHS. These constructs have
been studied extensively with factor modeling and we estab-
lished the unidimensionality of each scale before saving factor
scores. We also used a method (i.e., Bartlett's) that produces
unbiased estimates of the true factor scores (Hershberger,
2005) and most of our life history domains contained one or
more survey developer created scale scores, which were pro-
duced using validated scales. However, it is possible that one or
more of the issues raised in our critique of psychometric studies
of LHS also apply to the literatures establishing these con-
structs' validities. Indeed, recent work suggests that stationarity
(i.e., measurement invariance over time) does not hold for
Richardson et al. 19
depression, a construct that has been studied extensively (Fried
et al., 2016). Unfortunately, it was simply outside the scope of
this study to establish fit and measurement invariance for all the
constructs included, or essentially an analysis of the validity of
the broader psychological literature. To the extent that LHS
indicator items used in this study do not actually share prox-
imate common causes that correspond to the factors subsuming
them in factor models, it may be correspondingly unreasonable
to posit higher order LHS factors.
Future Directions
We touched upon directions for future research throughout the
Discussion section. Here we provide a concise summary of our
model's implications for researchers wishing to carry out psy-
chometric studies applying LHT to human variation. First, we
have followed Figueredo et al. (2006) in theorizing that com-
mon adaptations underlie allocations of resources to fitness
components. One or more adaptations may carry out these
allocations--our study suggests that it is not the same proxi-
mate mechanisms that explain levels of investment in indica-
tors of mating competition and Super-K. Importantly, this does
not imply that the fast­slow LHS continuum is not useful for
understanding human variation. Rather, a single factor simply
doesn't seem to capture all the important human life history
variation. Thus, future studies should measure Super-K and
also mating competition (see the Discussion section for lists
of promising indicators).
Second, we contend that existing measures of K-factors will
likely continue to be useful, but more studies are needed to
confirm their structure and test them for measurement invar-
iance (e.g., across the sexes). In addition, mating effort scales
can used along with indicators such as sensation-seeking and
risk-taking to measure mating competition. Once the dimen-
sionality of LHS indicators is better confirmed, future studies
can attempt to clarify the identities of the mating competition
and Super-K factors by determining their core aspects (e.g.,
perhaps internal working model formation and empathy form
the core of Super-K). They can also attempt to identify psy-
chological and physiological mechanisms that mediate any
trade-offs between the two factors (e.g., testosterone or stress
responsivity). Finally, future studies should incorporate addi-
tional life history indicators such as pubertal timing, sexual
debut, and life span to ensure that we are not simply document-
ing variation in lifestyle (see Copping et al., 2016). They
should also determine whether these indicators reflect or are
antecedents of mating competition and Super-K. This can be
determined, for instance, by using SEM and longitudinal panel
data to test the whether the Super-K factor is invariant across
time and manifests as things like pubertal timing earlier and
also parenting effort later.
Third, our study provides some implications for future
tests of psychosocial acceleration theory (see, e.g., Belsky
et al., 1991; Draper & Harpending, 1982). In particular, SES
had a moderate positive effect on mating competition and no
direct effect on Super-K holding parental harshness and
unpredictability constant, while harshness had effects consis-
tent prior research and unpredictability had only a negative
direct effect on Super-K. Thus, higher childhood SES may
actually increase mating competition despite a possible small
indirect dampening effect through decreased parental harsh-
ness. Many studies have used SES as the sole indicator of
harshness and this is probably inadequate because harshness
(cues to mortality risk) and status/access to resources are
unique in western environments and likely have unique
effects. Thus, we suggest that future studies measure multiple
aspects of environment so that they can disentangle effects of
status and access to resources from the effects of exposure to
mortality cues. However, we also note that relying on SES
may be less problematic in traditional societies where varia-
tion in wealth is probably more directly relevant to survival.
Future research can address this point.
Conclusions
This study used nationally representative data and SEM with
bifactor models to confirm the structure of middle adult life
history indicators. We found statistically independent mating
competition and Super-K dimensions. The effects of parental
harshness and childhood unpredictability on Super-K were
consistent with past research. However, childhood SES had a
moderate positive effect on mating competition and no effect
on Super-K. Moreover, unpredictability did not predict mating
competition. We conclude that human LHS is more complex
that previously suggested, at least among adults in the United
States. In combination with our review, these findings suggest
that psychometric research on human LHS is in its early stages.
Future research should explore the absence of an effect
between mating competition and Super-K; test these dimen-
sions for invariance by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic
region; conduct additional tests of whether the indicators that
functioned well in this study may provide valid measurement
of LHS; and address the potential for genetic and shared envi-
ronmental confounding of the associations between childhood
environment and adult LHS.

Notes
1. Bifactor and second-order models are closely related. In fact, they
are equivalent when Schmidt and Leiman (1957) solution holds,
such that (1) bifactor model loadings equal the product of second-
order models' first- and second-order loadings and (2) the ratio of
general factor loadings to domain-specific loadings is the same
within each domain-specific factor. Yung, Thissen, and McLeod
(1999) showed that second-order models are nested within bifac-
tor models, which are nested within ``full'' second-order models.
Thus, the bifactor model can be seen as a less restrictive version
of the second-order model. A graphical comparison of the
bifactor, second-order, and full second-order models is displayed
in Figure 1.
2. The analytic sample included the core sample of singletons
(n ¼ 3,487) and city oversamples (n ¼ 757). See the following
link below for more information about the Midlife in the United
States samples. http://www.midus.wisc.edu/midus1/index.php
3. We chose a more limited number of imputations in this case
because each additional one required extra-factor analyses and
we also needed to look at modification indices in each set to
diagnose model problems. There is not yet a developed theoretical
basis for combining modification indices across imputed sets.
4. Some of these were scale scores as described below.
5. We included sexuality as an indicator of Super-K because it is an
important aspect of love and attachment formation (Mikulincer,
2006). We also included sexuality as an indicator of mating com-
petition because we theorized that many of its facets (e.g., effort
put into sexual aspects of life and frequency of sex) could reflect
mating effort in addition to effort devoted to mate retention.
6. Numerical integration is required to estimate structural equations
models that include categorical and continuous observed vari-
ables. Unfortunately, numerical integration becomes extremely
computationally demanding as the number of latent variables
increases (see Muth´
en & Muth´
en, 2015). At eight or more latent
variables, models tend to fail to converge. Our study would have
included more than 25 latent variables, far too many for inclusion
of all the measurement portions.
7. We did not impose single-component solutions on the data.
8. We considered using a Poisson model because these were count
data, but decided to treat them as ordinal because the vast majority
of participants endorsed just a few of the possible counts (e.g., 99.
4% of middle adults had three or fewer sexual partners and 99.0%
had three or fewer marriages). In addition, in the case of number
of sex partners, the highest endorsable count was actually a cate-
gory--``more than six partners.''
9. In an additional step, we tested this model for differential indi-
cator functioning by age due to the substantial range observed.
We included age as a covariate of the environmental components
and regressed the mating competition and Super-K on it. One
large modification index suggested that alcohol abuse should be
regressed on age. We added this parameter and the resulting
model fit the data slightly worse (comparative fit index [CFI] ¼
.94, Tucker­Lewis index [TLI] ¼ .91, and root mean square error
of approximation [RMSEA] ¼ .05) than Model 2, but no large
modification indices were observed. Thus, only alcohol abuse
appeared to function differentially by age. Within levels of mating
competition, older participants appeared to be more likely to
abuse alcohol (b ¼ .23).
10. We also tested whether the environmental components interacted
to predict the latent variables in the model. With interactions
specified, the model fit the data well (CFI ¼ .96, TLI ¼ .94, and
RMSEA ¼ .04) and no large modifications indices were observed.
Unpredictability and harshness interacted to predict liability to
substance use (b ¼ .12), but no other significant effects were
observed. These findings seem to be in line with Brumbach, Fig-
ueredo, and Ellis (2009).
