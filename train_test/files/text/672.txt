SCHIP Making Progress: Increased Take-Up
Contributes To Coverage Gains
This important vehicle for covering children has moved low-income
children out of the ranks of the uninsured, but challenges remain.
by Peter J. Cunningham
ABSTRACT: Previous research based on the Community Tracking Study (CTS) showed that
while coverage expansions through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)
greatly increased children's eligibility for public or private health insurance coverage,
uninsurance rates remained unchanged because of low take-up by eligible children. How-
ever, more recent data show that this is changing. Children's uninsurance rates decreased
sharply between 1999 and 2001; these changes were greatest in communities where
take-up rates have traditionally been the lowest and uninsurance rates the highest. Al-
though uninsurance rates still can be decreased further, state budget pressures threaten
the momentum toward higher participation in public programs.
To i n c r e a s e insurance coverage
among low-income children, the State
Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) was enacted in 1997. Enrollment had
reached 3.6 million by June 2002, and several
studies have noted decreases in children's
uninsurance rates since its implementation.1
Nevertheless, very little is known about how
children's coverage availability and enroll-
ment have changed, and what the potential is
for future gains in coverage.
One key area of concern among policy-
makers is the level of Medicaid and SCHIP
participation among those who are eligible.
Despite efforts by federal and state govern-
ments, an earlier study indicated continued
low participation of eligible children despite
increased eligibility.2 Other studies have also
examined participation in SCHIP and Medic-
aid, but none has examined changes in partici-
pation since SCHIP was implemented.3
Children's uninsurance rates vary across the
country, and a disproportionately large num-
ber of uninsured children are concentrated in
areas with very high uninsurance rates. While
the greatest potential for gains in coverage ex-
ist in such areas, it may be more difficult to in-
crease coverage there. For example, participa-
tion in public coverage programs tends to be
lower than in other areas (despite higher costs
for private insurance).4 Barriers to public pro-
gram enrollment, such as a more burdensome
application process, immigration status con-
cerns, or greater stigma about accepting gov-
ernment-sponsored health coverage, may be
greater as well. Failure to remove these barri-
ers will greatly limit the ability of SCHIP to re-
duce the number of uninsured children, and
there will continue to be large disparities in
coverage and access to care.
This study uses data from three rounds of
the Community Tracking Study (CTS) house-

hold survey covering the period 1997­2001 to
show detailed estimates of changes in chil-
dren's health insurance coverage since SCHIP.
The study focuses on two issues for which
there is scant previous research: (1) changes in
participation levels--or "take-up"--of
Medicaid/SCHIP coverage; and (2) coverage
changes in areas with high uninsurance com-
pared with other areas. Results are then used
to assess the potential for future gains in chil-
dren's coverage.
Data And Methods
The CTS is a longitudinal study designed to
track changes in the health care system and the
effects of these changes on individuals.5 The
CTS household survey is designed to produce
representative estimates, for the U.S. popula-
tion and sixty randomly selected communities,
of health insurance coverage, access to care,
use of services, and perceived quality of care.6
Three rounds of the CTS household survey
have been completed, the first between Au-
gust 1996 and August 1997, just before the pas-
sage and implementation of SCHIP. The sec-
ond round was completed between August
1998 and October 1999, just after most states
had begun implementation of their programs,
and SCHIP enrollment increased from less
than one million in late 1998 to just under two
million in late 1999.7 The most recent round
was completed between August 2000 and Sep-
tember 2001, by the end of which SCHIP en-
rollment had increased to about 3.5 million
children.8 The total sample for this study con-
tains about 28,000 children, including 9,600
from the 1996­97 survey, and 9,200 each from
the 1998­99 and 2000­01 surveys.9
n Classification of CTS communities.
The CTS is unique among major national sur-
veys of health insurance coverage and health
care in that it allows representative estimates
for individual communities as well as groups
of communities. The sixty CTS communities
are classified into three groups based on chil-
dren's uninsurance rates in the 1996­97 survey
(pre-SCHIP): low-uninsurance communities
(children's uninsurance rates of less than 8 per-
cent), moderate-uninsurance communities (8­
15 percent), and high-uninsurance communi-
ties (16 percent or higher). Estimates for each
group of sites are weighted to be representa-
tive of all U.S. communities with low, moder-
ate, or high percentages of uninsured children
before SCHIP.
n Defining eligibility for and take-up of
public and private coverage. Eligibility for
public coverage is defined as being eligible for
Medicaid or other state coverage programs
(such as SCHIP). Determining eligibility for
children in the sample takes into account year-
and state-specific criteria related to age, in-
come, family composition, and parents' labor-
force participation.10 State-specific criteria as
of 1996 were used to determine eligibility for
Medicaid and selected other state programs
for the 1996­97 survey.11 For the 1998­99 and
2000­01 surveys, state-specific criteria for
Medicaid, as well as the age and income crite-
ria for the SCHIP programs that existed dur-
ing the latter part of 1998 and 2000, respec-
tively, were used.
Eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP in this
study does not take into account program-
specific income disregards as well as the legal
status of foreign-born noncitizen children, be-
cause of the lack of data in the CTS.12 Although
these limitations are important when deter-
mining eligibility for individuals, they are
likely to be less important for showing aggre-
gate estimates of eligibility for a population
and therefore would have little effect on our
conclusions. In fact, when comparing similar
time periods, CTS estimates of children who
are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP are almost
identical to other national estimates of eligibil-
ity that account for legal status and income
disregards.13 CTS estimates of Medicaid eligi-
bility before SCHIP are also close to other
estimates.14
Accounting for foreign-born children's legal
status could have a disproportionate effect on
estimates of eligibility for high-uninsurance
relative to low-uninsurance communities. In
the findings section, it is demonstrated that
the extent of the error in high-uninsurance
communities is not likely to materially affect
our overall results and conclusions.

Children were considered to be eligible for
employer coverage if either parent was offered
and eligible for coverage through an employer
on the day of the interview. Although the CTS
does not ascertain whether parents were of-
fered dependent coverage, other data show
that 98 percent of employees who are offered
coverage are also offered family coverage.15
Take-up rates reflect the percentage of eli-
gible children who actually enroll in
employer-sponsored or public coverage. The
denominator for computing take-up rates for
employer coverage is based on the number of
children determined to be eligible, as defined
above. For Medicaid/SCHIP, the denominator
for computing take-up rates is based on the
number of children who are eligible and who
are not enrolled in any type of private insur-
ance coverage. Numerators for both are based
on the number of children enrolled in that
type of coverage on the day of the interview.
The computation of take-up rates for
Medicaid/SCHIP differs from the earlier study
in that that study included all income-eligible
children in the denominator, regardless of
whether they were enrolled in private insur-
ance.16 Since privately insured children are
technically not eligible for SCHIP, excluding
them allows for a more accurate assessment of
public program participation. It also results in
a higher estimate of Medicaid/SCHIP take-up
in this study than in the earlier study (because
of a smaller denominator).
Study Findings
n Changes in coverage. Children's un-
insurance rates did not change between the
1996­97 and 1998­99 surveys, but they began
to decline between 1998­99 and 2000­01 (Ex-
hibit 1). Nearly 20 percent fewer children were
uninsured in 2000­01 than in 1998­99. Per-
haps even more striking is that the decline oc-
curred almost entirely in communities with
moderate and high uninsurance rates. The per-
centage of low-income uninsured children de-
creased from 20.6 percent to 14.6 percent in
moderate-insurance communities and from
29.5 percent to 22.8 percent in high-
uninsurance communities.
Gains in coverage were due entirely to large
increases in the percentage of children en-
rolled in public coverage. Among low-income
children, the percentage with Medicaid/
SCHIP coverage increased from 28.9 percent
in 1996­97 to 36.7 percent in 2000­01.17 More-
over, all of these increases occurred in moder-
ate- and high-uninsurance communities. Low-
uninsurance communities already had rela-
tively high rates of public coverage among low-
income children (36.8 percent), as a result of
relatively expansive public programs that ex-
isted before SCHIP, and rates of public cover-
age for this group did not change between
1996­97 and 2000­01.
There was also a decrease in low-income
children's private insurance coverage during
this period; this decrease took place entirely in
moderate- and high-uninsurance communi-
ties. Other research based on the CTS shows
that Medicaid/SCHIP expansions resulted in
some substitution of public for private insur-
ance coverage (known as "crowding out"), and
the results in this paper suggest that this sub-
stitution was concentrated in communities
with moderate uninsurance rates or higher.18
n Changes in eligibility. Much of the in-
crease in Medicaid/SCHIP coverage between
1996­97 and 2000­01 was driven by dramatic
gains in eligibility, especially among low-
income children between the 1996­97 and
1998­99 surveys (Exhibit 2). Again, the largest
gains occurred among children in moderate-
and high-uninsurance communities, where eli-
gibility before SCHIP had been the lowest.
Eligibility also increased in low-
uninsurance communities, but the increase
was not as large or dramatic as elsewhere (Ex-
hibit 2). Many low-uninsurance communities
are in states that already had expansive public
coverage programs before SCHIP, either
through optional Medicaid expansions that
increased eligibility well beyond the federal
mandates or through separate state programs
with generous eligibility levels. Examples of
the latter prior to SCHIP include Washington
(Basic Health Plan), Minnesota (Minnesota-
Care), and Massachusetts (Children's Medical
Security Plan), which all had low-uninsurance

communities in the CTS sample.19 Thus,
SCHIP essentially allowed states with tradi-
tionally less generous programs to "catch up"
to states that already had expansive programs.
The results may overstate the percentage of
low-income children eligible for Medicaid/
SCHIP in high-uninsurance communities,
since these areas tend to have a higher propor-
tion of foreign-born children (mostly of His-
panic origin) than low-uninsurance areas have.
Based on analyses of states with high percent-
ages of uninsured and foreign-born children
(Texas, California, and Florida), I estimate that
being able to account for legal status would re-
duce eligibility rates in high-uninsurance com-
munities by three to five percentage points at
most.20 This modest discrepancy would not al-
ter the conclusion that differences in eligibility
between high- and low-uninsurance commu-
nities all but disappeared between 1996­97
and 2000­01.
n Changes in take-up rates. With the
substantial gains in eligibility, the problem of
uninsured children is primarily a problem of

1998­99 among low-income children (Exhibit
3). This decrease is likely attributable to the
large increase in the number of newly eligible
children during this period (that is, an increase
in the denominator), and it was too early for
many of these new eligibles to become aware of
the program and enroll.
Take-up rates began to increase from 60.5
percent in 1998­99 to 65.7 percent in 2000­01;
further analysis indicates that this increase
was not the result of changes in the underlying
characteristics of eligible children.21 The in-
crease in take-up rates was most notable in
moderate- and high-uninsurance communi-
ties, which also saw the largest decreases in
uninsurance rates.22 Low-uninsurance com-
munities had the highest take-up rates
throughout the study period, although there
was no increase in take-up between 1998­99
and 2000­01. This may reflect in part greater
program maturity in states that began ex-
panding coverage even before SCHIP.

Uninsurance rates in communities with
moderate and high uninsurance did not de-
crease as much as they might have, because
take-up rates of employer-sponsored coverage
among low-income children also fell during
this period, especially between 1997 and 1999.
This decline may reflect some crowding out as
a result of expansions in Medicaid/SCHIP eli-
gibility.23 Private health insurance premiums
and employees' contributions to premiums
also tend to be higher in high-uninsurance
communities, which may further contribute to
crowding out.24 As insurance costs continue to
increase, Medicaid and SCHIP provide an im-
portant safety net for many low-income par-
ents who find insurance premiums for family
coverage increasingly difficult to afford.
n Potential for further gains. Despite the
fact that take-up rates of public coverage rose
in communities with moderate and high un-
insurance rates, they are still considerably
lower than take-up rates in communities with
low uninsurance. Since coverage expansions
are relatively recent in moderate- and high-
uninsurance communities, there is still poten-
tial for take-up rates to increase there. On the
other hand, experience with low-uninsurance
communities--many of which are in states
with better-established public coverage pro-
grams--suggests that there may be an upper
threshold of participation that could be diffi-
cult to exceed.
To examine the potential for further gains
in coverage if increases in Medicaid/SCHIP
take-up rates were to continue, predicted un-
insurance rates were computed assuming
higher take-up rates than what was actually
observed in the survey data, with all other fac-
tors held constant. Three sets of predictions
are computed: (1) assuming that all communi-
ties achieve a 75 percent take-up rate for
Medicaid/SCHIP (which is equal to the 2000­
01 actual rate for low-uninsurance communi-
ties, and the highest rate observed for that time
period); (2) assuming that all communities
achieve an 80 percent take-up rate (which is
roughly equal to the pre-SCHIP take-up rate
for low-uninsurance communities, and the
highest rate observed in the CTS data); and (3)
assuming that all communities achieve an 85
percent take-up rate (which is higher than
what has previously been observed in the CTS
data and is comparable to take-up rates of
employer-sponsored coverage). The results of
these predictions (Exhibit 4) show that there
is still potential for further reductions in chil-
dren's uninsurance rates (up to a 40 percent
decrease from 2000­01 levels if take-up rates of
85 percent are achieved).

of declining uninsurance among children can
be attained depends in large part on the suc-
cess of efforts to increase participation in com-
munities with high uninsurance rates. Despite
the fact that take-up of public coverage in-
creased in these areas between 1998­99 and
2000­01, it still lags well behind take-up in ar-
eas with lower uninsurance rates (75 percent
take-up in low-uninsurance areas compared
with 64 percent in high-uninsurance areas,
Exhibit 3). Increasing participation levels in
high-uninsurance areas to at least 75 percent
may prove to be difficult if there are continued
barriers to enrollment in these areas, despite
recent successes.
Implications For Policy
After a slow start, SCHIP has resulted in a
reduction in uninsurance among children. The
findings strongly suggest that this is happen-
ing not only through expanding the number of
children who are eligible for coverage but also
by increasing participation among eligible
children. Perhaps even more encouraging is
that some of the greatest gains are taking place
in areas where uninsurance rates have tradi-
tionally been the highest and public program
participation the lowest. This suggests that
states' efforts to reduce administrative barriers
and encourage enrollment are paying off. Fu-
ture studies should examine features of state
SCHIP programs--such as outreach activities,
efforts to reduce enrollment barriers, and pro-
gram model (that is, Medicaid expansion ver-
sus a separate SCHIP program)--to under-
stand those aspects of SCHIP that have been
most effective in increasing enrollment.
Nevertheless, participation continues to lag
in areas with a disproportionately large num-
ber of uninsured children, and the potential for
future gains greatly depends on being able to
further increase take-up in these areas. Despite
recent successes, barriers to enrollment per-
sist, including the continuing stigma of enroll-
ment in public programs among some poten-
tial beneficiaries, remaining complexities in
the application process, confusion or apathy
among some potential beneficiaries, and cost-
sharing provisions in some states.25
Recent events threaten the gains made to
date and could undermine the potential for
further reductions in the number of uninsured
children. Increases in Medicaid and SCHIP en-
rollment along with rising health care costs are
contributing to states' budgetary pressures,
which are intensifying efforts by states to con-
tain these costs. While few states were actively
considering reducing eligibility at the time of
this writing, more states are reducing or elimi-
nating strategies to encourage enrollment.26
The return of high health care inflation as
well as rising unemployment also might re-
duce the number of children with private in-
surance coverage. This could offset the in-
creases in Medicaid/SCHIP coverage by
raising the number of uninsured children who
are eligible for neither employer-sponsored
nor public coverage. Higher premiums could
lead parents to transfer more children from
private to public coverage, which could further
increase enrollment and the pressure on states
to limit eligibility and enrollment.
Thus, the period of strong economic
growth, flush state budgets, and general en-
thusiasm for expanding enrollment in public
coverage programs that existed in the early
years of SCHIP implementation has given way
to a period of greater economic uncertainty
and greater concern about controlling pro-
gram costs. Continued monitoring of chil-
dren's health insurance coverage is needed if
we are to understand how this shift in priori-
ties will affect the recent gains in children's
coverage, and the potential for future gains.

9. A small number of children in each round of the
CTS were not living with parents or guardians
(fewer than fifteen per round); they were ex-
cluded from the analysis.
10. As in other studies that examined eligibility, fam-
ilies in the CTS are defined as the household
members who would be eligible for coverage un-
der most family health insurance policies.
11. Eligibility for state coverage programs other than
Medicaid that existed before SCHIP was also
considered. Since these varied considerably in
terms of program design, comprehensiveness of
benefits, and enrollment limits, we included only
those where program penetration exceeded 5
percent of uninsured children in the state. These
programs include MinnesotaCare, Washington
State's Basic Health Plan, Massachusetts' Medi-
cal Security Plan, New York's Child Health Plus,
California's AIM, and Pennsylvania's Children's
Health Insurance Program.
12. Income in the CTS is reported as annual family
income from all sources. Similar to other national
surveys of health care, family income is reported
for the prior year (for example, people inter-
viewed in 2001 were asked about family income
for 2000), while health insurance coverage is
measured at the time of the survey. The extent to
which aggregate estimates of eligibility and take-
up are biased because of the different reference
periods for income and insurance coverage is un-
known, but this is unlikely to affect the conclu-
sions from this study concerning change over
time and variation across communities.
13. A recent study that applied eligibility criteria for
2000 to the 1999 National Survey of America's
Families (NSAF) found that 50 percent of chil-
dren were eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, even
when accounting for income disregards and im-
puting the legal status of immigrant children
(which was not observed directly in the NSAF).
When eligibility criteria for 2000 are applied to
the 1998­99 CTS household survey sample (the
CTS round that is most comparable to the 1999
NSAF), 49 percent of children were estimated to
be eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP. The close-
ness of CTS aggregate estimates to other esti-
mates of eligibility may reflect in part the fact
that income disregards and legal status are to
some extent offsetting, since taking income dis-
regards into account increases the percentage of
children who are eligible for Medicaid/SCHIP,
while taking the legal status of noncitizen chil-
dren into account decreases the percentage eligi-
ble. The estimates based on NSAF can be found
in L. Dubay, J. Haley, and G. Kenney, Children's Eli-
gibility for Medicaid and SCHIP: A View from 2000
(Washington: Urban Institute, March 2002).
14. The percentage of children eligible for Medicaid
and other public programs in the CTS was 30.8
percent in 1996­97, compared with an estimate
of 29.5 percent based on the 1996 Medical Ex-

mation on the estimate from MEPS, see T.M.
Selden, J.S. Banthin, and J.W. Cohen, "Medicaid's
Problem Children: Eligible but Not Enrolled,"
Health Affairs (May/June 1998): 192­200.
15. This estimate is based on unpublished data from
the 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Em-
ployer Health Insurance Survey.
16. Cunningham, "Targeting Communities."
17. As are other survey-based estimates of public
program enrollment, CTS estimates of public
program enrollment are lower than those based
on administrative data. Some of this reflects the
fact that people with dual private and public
coverage in the CTS were classified as "private,"
while the "Medicaid/SCHIP" category reflects
those with that coverage only. However, at least
some of the discrepancy in public coverage esti-
mates between survey and administrative data is
also likely to be due to errors with administrative
data and not just errors with survey data. For ex-
ample, see S.J. Blumberg and M.L. Cynamon,
"Misreporting Medicaid Enrollment: Results of
Three Studies Linking Telephone Surveys to
State Administrative Records" (Paper presented
at the Seventh Annual Conference on Health
Survey Research Methods, Williamsburg, Vir-
ginia, September 1999).
18. A more thorough analysis of the coverage
changes between 1996­97 and 1998­99 using the
CTS data showed that eligibility expansions at-
tributable to SCHIP did result in a considerable
amount of substitution of public for private cov-
erage, or crowding out. See P.J. Cunningham, J.
Hadley, and J. Reschovsky, "The Effects of SCHIP
on Children's Health Insurance Coverage: Early
Evidence from the Community Tracking Study,"
Medical Care Research and Review (December 2002):
359­383. This analysis was also updated to in-
clude the more recent data for 2000­01 and can
be found at www.hschange.org.
19. Some communities in the low-uninsurance
group had sizable changes in coverage. For ex-
ample, Boston and Seattle showed decreases in
children's uninsurance rates between 1996­97
and 2000­01. However, others either experi-
enced no change or had increases in uninsurance,
with the result being no net change for the group
as a whole.
20. Dubay et al., Children's Eligibility. In computing
state-specific estimates of eligibility, the authors
computed two sets of estimates: (1) assuming
that noncitizen children who met the other cri-
teria were eligible for Medicaid/SCHIP, and (2)
assuming that all noncitizen children who met
the other criteria were not eligible for Medicaid/
SCHIP. Thus, the discrepancy of three to five per-
centage points between the two estimates for the
three states with high uninsurance rates repre-
sents an upper bound, and the actual discrep-
ancy is likely to be lower.
21. Changes in take-up rates between 1998­99 and
2000­01 could reflect changes in the underlying
characteristics of eligible children either because
some types of children are more or less predis-
posed to enroll in public programs, or because
some categories of public program eligibility are
known to have higher take-up rates (for exam-
ple, poorer children eligible for Medicaid gener-
ally have higher take-up rates than do children
eligible for SCHIP). To test this, I estimated a lo-
gistic regression model of the likelihood of hav-
ing Medicaid/SCHIP coverage for the combined
sample of eligible children from the 1998­99 and
2000­01 samples (that is, the same sample as in
Exhibit 3). Independent variables included chil-
dren's age, sex, race/ethnicity, health status, fam-
ily structure (number of parents, number of sib-
lings), family income, and a binary variable indi-
cating whether the child is from the 1998­99 or
2000­01 sample. The results showed that the
likelihood of having Medicaid/SCHIP coverage
was higher in 2000­01 than in 1998­99 (based on
the results of the binary variable), even after
changes in the characteristics of eligible children
were controlled for.
22. To the extent that the increase in eligibility was
overstated in moderate- and high-uninsurance
communities, the increase in take-up in these
communities is likely to be understated, and the
actual increase in take-up is likely to be larger
(that is, the denominators include more children
who are not eligible).
23. The substitution effect between 1997 and 1999
was demonstrated in Cunningham et al., "The
Effects of SCHIP." Although the decreases in
take-up of employer-sponsored coverage for
low-income children in moderate- and high-
uninsurance communities were not statistically
significant, the size of the decrease is twice as
large in high- as in moderate-uninsurance com-
munities. This explains why high-uninsurance
communities did not experience a larger de-
crease in uninsurance rates than moderate-
uninsurance communities did (see Exhibit 1), de-
spite the fact that increases in eligibility were
somewhat larger in high-uninsurance communi-
ties.
