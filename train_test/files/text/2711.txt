Traumatic stress results in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities and an increased risk to both suicidal behaviors
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous work out of our laboratory identified SKA2 DNA methylation associations with
suicidal behavior in the blood and brain of multiple cohorts. Interaction of SKA2 with stress predicted suicidal behavior with ~ 80%
accuracy. SKA2 is hypothesized to reduce the ability to suppress cortisol following stress, which is of potentially high relevance in
traumatized populations. Our objective was to investigate the interaction of SKA2 and trauma exposure on HPA axis function,
suicide attempt and PTSD. SKA2 DNA methylation at Illumina HM450 probe cg13989295 was assessed for association with suicidal
behavior and PTSD metrics in the context of Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores in 421 blood and 61 saliva samples from the
Grady Trauma Project (GTP) cohort. Dexamethasone suppression test (DST) data were evaluated for a subset of 209 GTP subjects.
SKA2 methylation interacted with CTQ scores to predict lifetime suicide attempt in saliva and blood with areas under the receiver
operator characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.76 and 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6­0.92, P = 0.003, and CI: 0.65­0.78, Po0.0001)
and to mediate the suppression of cortisol following DST ( = 0.5 ± 0.19, F = 1.51, degrees of freedom (df) = 12/167, P = 0.0096).
Cumulatively, the data suggest that epigenetic variation at SKA2 mediates vulnerability to suicidal behaviors and PTSD through
dysregulation of the HPA axis in response to stress.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide represents a major public health problem, claiming over
40 000 lives per year. Suicide rates have remained stable over the
past 60 years at around 10­12 per 100 000.1 One strategy
proposed by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention
to reduce the rate has been to target intervention efforts toward
subgroups at the greatest risk, a strategy requiring the identifica-
tion of reliable biomarkers capable of identifying those at current
or future risk.2 Previously identified risk factors implicated in
suicide include biological or genetic characteristics, early-life
trauma, stressful life events, impulsive aggressive traits, psycho-
pathology, inadequate social support, access to lethal means and
substance abuse.3­5 Recent work by our group and others has
identified biomarkers at the epigenetic or gene expression level
capable of predicting suicidal behavior from blood.
Previous work suggests that epigenetic alterations in the
spindle and kinetochore-associated protein 2 (SKA2) gene may
represent a promising biomarker for detecting suicidal behaviors.6
This study determined that the cytosine, but not the thymine,
allele of rs7208505 could be methylated and that higher DNA
methylation at this site predicted lower SKA2 expression in the
frontal cortex of suicide completers,6 along with lower levels of
microRNA-301a in the cortex of depressed suicide completers.7
Expression of this microRNA is tied to SKA2 expression, suggesting
that this observation may be a proxy of suicide-associated SKA2
decreases. Recently, Niculescu et al.8 demonstrated significant
SKA2 expression decreases in the peripheral blood in both
individuals with high suicidal ideation as well as in suicide
completers relative to controls. The same group published
previously on the biomarker efficacy of various peripheral blood-
based gene expression biomarkers9 that have also subsequently
been independently replicated.10 Data exist to suggest that these
gene systems may be linked,6 further implicating the possible
efficacy of biomarker-based suicidal behavior prediction. An
important feature of both biomarker panels is the observation
of consistent associations across a broad range of suicidal
behaviors including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and suicide,
suggesting that dysregulation of the gene pathways associated
with these biomarkers may be an important underlying feature for
the progression to increasingly severe suicidal behaviors.
SKA2 has been implicated as important for enabling glucocor-
ticoid receptor nuclear transactivation.11 As a result, epigenetic
variation influencing levels of SKA2 gene expression may be
important for modulating the sensitivity of the hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. A small amount of data exist to
suggest that SKA2 epigenetic variation may moderate the
suppression of cortisol following stress.6 Importantly, other factors
known to influence the HPA axis such as early-life trauma
exposure may interact with SKA2 epigenetic variation to moderate
risk for suicidal behaviors. In addition, epigenetic variation at SKA2
may have relevance to other psychiatric disorders that have

evidence for HPA axis system disruption such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).
In this study, we used an existing data set of DNA methylation
at the SKA2 3'-untranslated repeat (UTR) CpG (cg13989295) in the
Grady Trauma Project cohort to investigate the effects of trauma
exposure on SKA2, suicide risk and PTSD. Below, we demonstrate
the effects of trauma exposure and SKA2 on suicide risk and
discuss various confounding factors influencing suicide prediction
efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Grady Trauma Project
The subjects for this study were part of a larger investigation of genetic
and environmental factors that predict the response to stressful life events
in a predominantly African American, urban population of low socio-
economic status.12­14 Research participants are approached in the waiting
rooms of primary care clinics of a large, public hospital while either waiting
for their medical appointments or while waiting with others who were
scheduled for medical appointments. After the subjects provided written
informed consent, they participated in a verbal interview and blood draw.
This cohort is characterized by high rates of interpersonal violence and
psychosocial stress; the majority of subjects report at least one major
trauma during their lifetime, and the number of traumatic experiences in
childhood and adulthood predict psychiatric symptom severity in
adulthood.14,15 DNA methylation analyses were performed in N = 421
subjects from the blood of whom a subset of N = 61 samples were also
collected and analyzed from saliva.
Johns Hopkins Center for Prevention Research Study
Data are from a prospective study conducted in a predominantly African
American, urban population.16­18 Details of the trial are available
elsewhere.16,17
In brief, the trial recruited two successive cohorts of students (1196 from
Cohort 1 in 1985 and 1115 from Cohort 2 in 1986) as they entered first
grade in 19 elementary schools in Baltimore, MD, USA (49.8% male and
67.1% ethnic minority consistent with the population in Baltimore City
schools). Since 1985, participants have been assessed through middle
school, twice in young adulthood and most recently when participants
were 30­32 years old. DNA methylation analyses were generated as
reported previously6 and were restricted to the 326 individuals participat-
ing at the age of 30­32 data collection wave who at the time of this
analysis provided a blood sample (60% female and 76% African American,
lacking another 12 who provided blood later).
All participants provided informed consent to participate. All procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Emory University
School of Medicine and the Grady Health Systems Research Oversight
Committee and by the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins
University, respectively. Samples were randomized and investigators were
blinded to the phenotypic status during experimental data processing as
reported previously. Detailed information on study sample characteristics
and phenotype metrics for suicidal behavior, PTSD and trauma metrics
appear in Supplementary Method S1 and Supplementary Table S1.
Biological samples
For both Grady Trauma Project (GTP) and Prevention Research Study (PRC),
whole blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for genetic
testing. As part of the GTP screen, saliva samples were also collected.
rs7208505 DNA methylation and genotype
SKA2 3'-UTR DNA methylation levels were determined using normalized
beta values for the cg13989295 probe from the Illumina (San Diego, CA,
USA) HumanMethylation450 BeadChip from data generated previously19,20
in the GTP cohort (Supplementary Method S2 and Supplementary Figure S1).
In the PRC cohort, SKA2 3'-UTR DNA methylation levels were deter-
mined by pyrosequencing and rs7208505 genotype values were
determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR as reported
previously.6
Dexamethasone suppression test
In the GTP cohort, whole blood was collected under fasting conditions
between 0800 and 0900 hours for baseline (that is, day 1) serum cortisol
measurements. A subset of 213 subjects received a low-dose dexametha-
sone suppression test (DST) in which they took 0.5 mg dexamethasone
orally at 2300 hours, and blood was collected on the next day (that is, day
2) between 0800 and 0900 hours. Serum cortisol at both time points was
measured using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Systems
Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA).
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, reported statistics derive from linear regression
analysis, adjusted for age, sex and race generated in R (http://www.
r-project.org/) using the function lm (dependent variable ~ (cg13989295
beta value ± rs7208505 genotype) × trauma metric+age+sex+race) where
the dependent variable was current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide
attempt or the natural log of the day-2 cortisol values from the DST. Unless
otherwise stated, the trauma metric for the GTP cohort was the total Child
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) score, whereas the first Eigen vector of a
principle components analysis combining reported sexual abuse and the
mean frequency of emotional or physical abuse was used for the PRC
cohort. Relevant additional covariates were determined according to the
strategy presented in the Supplementary Methods (Supplementary
Method S3, Supplementary Table S2). Using the Anderson­Darling test,
all data distributions that rejected the null hypothesis of normality were
subsequently evaluated with nonparametric tests. All statistical tests were
two-tailed; P  0.05 denotes statistical significance and ± denotes the
s.e.m. Where specified, genotype correction of SKA2 3'-UTR DNA
methylation values was achieved by taking the residuals of a linear model
of cg13989295 probe beta values as a function of the rs7208505 genotype.
In a similar manner and as justified in Supplementary Methods S3, we
adjusted SKA2 DNA methylation levels for past history of substance abuse
in all receiver operator characteristic curve analyses as the availability of
different substance abuse variables in the training data set precluded the
ability to account for substance-related decreases on SKA2 DNA
methylation.
Sliding window analyses were performed for visualization purposes,
whereby subsamples were grouped such that all individuals falling within
± 15 units for the CTQ total or ± 5 units for CTQ emotional, sexual or
physical abuse scores were included in the analysis. Differences in sliding
window lengths allow for inclusion of similar sample numbers per group
(mean sample size ~ 57 per window for all analyses).
RESULTS
Application of suicide prediction model to the GTP cohort
We aimed to predict lifetime suicide attempt using only SKA2
epigenetic and genetic variation without interacting covariates in
order to assess the biomarker efficacy of the model independent
of factors that may be independently associated with suicide. We
assessed the model efficacy in both N = 67 current suicidal ideators
compared with N = 337 controls and N = 99 lifetime suicide attempt
cases relative to N = 321 controls. We observed poor predictive
accuracy using the SKA2-only model that was significant for suicide
attempt but not suicidal ideation (area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) SI: 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.48­0.62, permuted P = 0.15, AUC suicidal attempt (SA): 0.58, 95%
CI: 0.52­0.64, permuted P = 0.017). Estimation of and adjustment for
individual cellular proportions did not substantially change the
results of this analysis (data not shown).
Identification of trauma interaction in the GTP cohort
Our previously published model demonstrated that SKA2 3'-UTR
DNA methylation significantly interacted with anxiety to moderate
suicidal behavior. In the GTP cohort, the total anxiety score (HAM-
A) did not significantly interact with SKA2 DNA methylation to
moderate suicide attempt (interaction  = 0.46 ± 0.095, F = 5.68,
degrees of freedom (df) = 13/338, P = 0.63); however, anxiety was
independently associated with both the child ( = 0.13 ± 0.025,
F = 5.13, df = 1/347, P = 3.5 × 10- 7) and lifetime trauma scores

( = 0.81 ± 0.14, F = 32, df = 1/345, P = 3.3 × 10- 8). Childhood
trauma scores were more significantly associated with
lifetime suicide attempt ( = 0.0083 ± 0.001, F = 59.8, df = 1/410,
P = 8.2 × 10- 14) than were lifetime trauma scores
( = 0.0304 ± 0.0066, F = 21.5, df = 1/407, P = 4.7 × 10-6).
We attempted to predict lifetime suicide attempt using only
SKA2 epigenetic and genetic variation without interacting
covariates in subsets of individuals with different levels of child
trauma exposure. We performed a sliding window analysis,
generating an AUC value for suicide attempt prediction for all
individuals within a range of 30 points on the CTQ. The results
depicted in Figure 1a demonstrate two peaks of maximum
predictive accuracy corresponding to groups in both the high
and low trauma categories. Importantly, the direction of suicide
attempt prediction in both cases appears to be reversed
between these low and high trauma-exposed groupings
(Figure 1e). This, in effect, cancels out the predictive efficacy of
the SKA2-only model and suggests that SKA2 3'UTR DNA
methylation may interact with the trauma status to moderate
suicide risk. Linear regression modeling in the GTP cohort
confirmed a significant interaction between CTQ total trauma
scores and SKA2 DNA methylation model terms after con-
trolling for age, sex, race and lifetime substance abuse history
(Table 1, Figure 2a). In the highly traumatized group, the
maximum predictive efficacy of N = 28 suicide attempt cases from
N = 37 non-attempters was an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58­0.83,
permuted P = 0.002).
Emotional abuse, more so than physical or sexual abuse,
accounted for a majority of the total CTQ score effect on suicide
attempt model predictability (Figure 1, Supplementary Result S1).
We next assessed model performance separately in subjects
previously classified as having experienced either low or severe
emotional abuse. In the severely abused group, the SKA2
epigenetic and genetic variation model predicted lifetime suicide
attempt from N = 51 cases compared with N = 55 non-suicide
attempters with an AUC of 0.695 (95% CI: 0.59­0.8, permuted
P = 0.005), whereas stronger associations were observed in
individuals having experienced emotional but not physical or
sexual abuse (Supplementary Result S2). In the low emotional
abuse-reporting group, N = 47 suicide attempters were not
significantly predicted, generating an AUC of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.47­
0.65, permuted P = 0.23).
Replication of the interaction between SKA2 and trauma on
suicidal behaviors
To corroborate the association of altered directionality of suicide
ideation/attempt prediction in low versus high trauma-exposed
subjects, we returned to the PRC cohort and assessed the
direction of suicidal behavior prediction as a function of trauma
exposure. We observed significant interactions for SKA2 3'-UTR
DNA methylation and rs7208505 genotype for suicidal ideation
and suicide attempt (Table 1, Figure 2b). The strength of the
interaction between trauma and SKA2 DNA methylation was
strongest when modeling trauma resulting from emotional
abuse as compared with physical or sexual abuse (Supple-
mentary Table S3).
Incorporation of trauma into the suicide prediction model
In light of the identified interaction of early-life trauma on suicide
attempt risk, we rebuilt the statistical model from the PRC cohort,
modeling the interaction of SKA2 DNA methylation and rs7208505
genotype interacting with trauma scores, adjusting for age and
sex. We assessed the efficacy in both N = 67 current suicidal
ideators compared with N = 337 controls and N = 99 lifetime
suicide attempt cases relative to N = 321 controls, incorporating
CTQ scores as the interactive covariate. Independent validation of
the model in the GTP cohort predicted current SI and lifetime SA

(GTP) cohort. Differences in sliding window lengths (±30 versus ± 5) allow for inclusion of similar sample numbers per group (mean sample
size ~ 57 per window for all analyses). Vertical red bars represent the windows where 95% confidence intervals for the AUC do not encompass
a null prediction of 0.5. Barplots of the mean suicide attempt (SA) minus non-SA score generated by the suicide prediction model (y axis) as a

All vertical red bars represent those windows where 95% confidence intervals for the AUC do not encompass a null prediction of 0.5.

CI: 0.65­0.78, permuted Po0.0001 and CI: 0.66­0.78, permuted

past substance abuse alone at predicting suicidal ideation (SI) and

Po0.0001, and CI: 0.62­0.73, permuted Po0.0001, respectively).
These results generated by SKA2 interacting with trauma were very
similar to those generated using anxiety (HAM-A) symptoms as the

permuted Po0.0001), respectively.

Prediction using DNA from saliva
For a subset of N = 61 individuals (Supplementary Table S1) from
the GTP cohort, DNA methylation values generated from saliva
DNA were available. A significant correlation was observed
between blood- and saliva-derived SKA2 3'-UTR DNA methylation
(R = 0.96, P = 2.2 × 10- 16), suggesting that DNA obtained from
salivary DNA may be efficacious for suicide behavior prediction.
We assessed the predictive efficacy of the PRC-generated model
for prediction of suicidal behavior in GTP saliva samples. The AUC
generated for the N = 19 suicide attempters from N = 42 non-
attempters interacting SKA2 variation with childhood abuse scores
was similar to that observed in the blood at 0.76 (95% CI: 0.6­0.92,
permuted P = 0.003), whereas the AUC generated interacting SKA2
with anxiety scores was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.53­0.86, permuted P = 0.041;
Figure 3b). Similarly to the blood-derived data, suicidal ideation
with both childhood abuse and anxiety-interacting models
generated AUCs of 0.66 and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.5­0.83, permuted
P = 0.14 and 95% CI: 0.49­0.83, permuted P = 0.11, respectively).
SKA2 interacts with childhood trauma to predict cortisol
suppression following dexamethasone treatment
DNA methylation values for SKA2 were obtained on day 1 of a 2-
day DST conducted in the GTP cohort. SKA2 3'-UTR DNA
methylation interacted with CTQ scores to mediate the degree
to which cortisol was suppressed on day 2 following the DST
(Table 1, Supplementary Figure S2); however, CTQ scores alone
were not associated with day-2 cortisol levels ( = 0.0036 ± 0.0038,
F = 0.88, df = 1/203, P = 0.35). Together, the data demonstrate a
functional role of SKA2 DNA methylation in mediating HPA axis
sensitivity. In this way, a combination of high SKA2 DNA
methylation in traumatized individuals is associated with lower
suppression of cortisol under stressful conditions.
Application of suicide prediction model to PTSD in GTP
Epigenetic variation at SKA2 may be efficacious for predicting
PTSD, a trauma-induced disorder with HPA axis abnormalities. We
therefore assessed the ability of the suicide prediction model to
identify PTSD cases from the GTP cohort. Without accounting for
childhood trauma, the model generated an AUC of 0.55 (95% CI:
0.48­0.63, permuted P = 0.24) to identify the 78 PTSD cases from
203 controls. Genotype-adjusted DNA methylation of cg13989295
was not associated with PTSD; however, there was correlation with
methylation of other SKA2 CpG sites, particularly in the promoter
(Supplementary Result S3, Supplementary Table S4,
Supplementary Table S5). Incorporation of CTQ scores into the
model generated an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65­0.79, permuted
Po0.0001). Consistent with the literature, PTSD demonstrated a
main effect of decreasing day-2 cortisol following the DST
( = - 1.34 ± 0.58, F = 2.17, df = 3/121, P = 0.021); however, CTQ
levels significantly interacted with the PTSD status to increase
post-DST day-2 cortisol levels ( = 0.023 ± 0.011, F = 2.17, df = 3
/121, P = 0.047). Notably, CTQ scores were lower among individ-
uals with PTSD and no suicide attempt compared with those
with both (Wilcoxon Rank Sum: PTSD Yes, SA No: N = 41,
mean = 51 ± 20, PTSD Yes, SA Yes: N = 37, mean = 61 ± 24,
P = 0.095) and higher among suicide attempters without comorbid
PTSD (Wilcoxon Rank Sum: PTSD No, SA No: N = 171, mean = 38
± 14, PTSD No, SA Yes: N = 32, mean = 53 ± 19, P = 3.5 × 10- 5).
There was a significant overrepresentation of suicide attempters
among PTSD cases (observed probability = 0.47, expected prob-
ability = 0.38, P = 0.032). Cumulatively, the data suggest the
different direction of SKA2-mediated effects on post-DST cortisol
levels with CTQ scores on day 2 may be mediated by the opposing
direction of PTSD and suicidal behavior on HPA axis sensitivity.
DISCUSSION
In our previous work, we reported a relatively high predictive
accuracy of the SKA2 suicide prediction model across two cohorts
and identified an association between genotype-corrected DNA
methylation of the SKA2 3'-UTR and neuronal SKA2 expression.6
This study expands upon these previous findings by assessing not
only the predictive accuracy of the biomarker model in an
independent and larger cohort but also the effect of the
biomarker model independent of interacting covariates and
detailing its performance in light of suicide risk factors such as
childhood trauma. The AUC values reported above are moderate.
There are a number of potential explanations for the lack of
strength of the reported AUCs. First, the GTP cohort represents a
primarily African American cohort, similar to the PRC cohort, with
Figure 3. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of suicide attempt prediction in blood and saliva. ROC curves generated by the model
generated in the Prevention Research Study (PRC) cohort and predicting suicide attempt in the GTP cohort in (a) blood and (b) saliva. The
training set data from the PRC cohort was generated by a linear model of suicide attempt as a function of the interaction of SKA2 3'-UTR DNA

SKA2 predicts suicidal behavior and PTSD

~ 75% African Americans. As reported previously, the allele
frequency of C-containing alleles is much smaller in this population
relative to Caucasian, Asian and Native American individuals,
suggesting that there may be a lower amount of biologically
informative alleles capable of conferring DNA methylation informa-
tion. Additional replication studies will be required in larger cohorts
with more ethnic diversity to better understand the predictive
efficacy of SKA2 in the general population. In addition, although our
supplementary analysis did not demonstrate a confounding effect
of other psychiatric illnesses, it remains possible that variation is
induced by different underlying psychiatric conditions as well as
different subtypes of suicidality.
Second, the predictions result from retrospective data, such that
epigenetic drift over time and the confounding influence of
various suicide- and trauma-associated lifestyle factors may
influence the prediction. In the GTP cohort, prediction of suicide
attempt metrics performed stronger than predicting suicidal
ideation. Our previous data indicated that elevated SKA2 levels
may be indicative of increasing severity of suicidal behaviors,
which is consistent with this observation. An increased signal may
be more important in a retrospective sample such as the GTP,
where biological samples were taken long after a suicide attempt
and factors affecting DNA methylation at SKA2 may have caused a
drift in suicide-relevant signal.
Suicidal ideation, attempt, anxiety, trauma and substance abuse
metrics were obtained through different scales in the GTP and PRC
cohorts. Although the results in both cohorts were consistent,
each has distinct clinical features that influence SKA2 methylation.
This fact calls into question whether SKA2 is capable of measuring
any suicide-relevant biology. In light of the findings detailing that
the SKA2 epigenetic and genetic variation independent of
interacting covariates was capable of similar predictive accuracies
in the severe trauma cases stands as a proof of principle that SKA2
alone may act as an efficacious biomarker in certain populations,
such as highly traumatized individuals.
Initial results in a small subset of DNA obtained from saliva
demonstrated a similar predictive efficacy to that observed in
blood. Approximately 74% of cells in the saliva are white blood
cells;21 therefore, a high overlap between blood- and saliva-based
findings is expected. It has been demonstrated that DNA derived
from the saliva may be a better proxy for the epigenetic status of
the brain,22,23 possibly because buccal tissue is derived from the
same primary germ layer as the brain, the ectoderm. However, the
relevance of peripheral biomarker signals at SKA2 to the brain
have been demonstrated previously6 and may result from a tissue
nonspecific reprogramming of the epigenome. The implication of
these observations is that salivary DNA may represent a useful
collection tissue for biomarker testing, an option that would
ultimately enable a less invasive and more cost-effective means to
perform biomarker testing.
Our previously published model demonstrated that SKA2 3'-UTR
DNA methylation significantly interacted with anxiety to moderate
suicidal behavior that was not replicated in the GTP cohort.
Although it is possible that our previously published anxiety
results may be linked to underlying trauma exposure, this
conclusion is not supported by the data. Instead, it is likely that
the underlying factor resulting in significant interactions with SKA2
is differential HPA axis sensitivity, which is an underlying feature of
both anxiety and trauma.
We identified a significant interaction between SKA2 variation
and trauma at mediating the response to the DST, a metric of HPA
axis sensitivity often dysregulated in suicidal individuals.3,24,25
Given the implicated role of SKA2 in facilitating glucocorticoid
receptor nuclear transactivation and anticorrelated relationship
with gene expression,6,8 the observed direction of association is
consistent with our previously proposed interpretation that
epigenetically driven decreases in SKA2 may inhibit the ability of
glucocorticoid receptor to properly suppress natural stress
response. This finding has relevance to other psychiatric disorders
such as PTSD, which may have altered HPA axis sensitivity. The
observed interaction is similar to that reported for other HPA axis-
relevant genes including CRHR1 and FKBP5. In both cases, high
CTQ scores moderate the relationship between genetic variation
and psychiatric symptoms or HPA­axis function.26,27 Indeed,
FKBP5 has also been associated with depression, anxiety and
PTSD.28­31 Such interactions with childhood maltreatment, includ-
ing those observed for SKA2, may result from a differential priming
of the HPA axis by early-life trauma. Similar to FKBP5, epigenetic
alterations at SKA2 may adapt over time in the presence of
heightened HPA axis sensitivity causing differential effects on the
glucocorticoid receptor-negative feedback system dependent on
the context of early-life exposure to stress and potentially mediated
by the genetic and epigenetic context of relevant genes. These
differential effects may predispose to stress-related disorders such
as suicide and PTSD, which have been demonstrated to have
opposing actions on the HPA axis, resulting in faster and slower
clearing of post-stress cortisol, respectively. This interpretation is
supported by the data as individuals with PTSD and no suicidal
behaviors had generally lower CTQ scores compared with those
with suicidal behavior. Thus, the observed interaction on HPA axis
sensitivity may be a result of the differential contributions of these
overlapping phenotypes in the subjects tested.
We observed that the SKA2 epigenetic and genetic biomarker
predicted civilian PTSD cases when child abuse was incorporated.
The degree to which our observations are based on comorbid
phenotypes or substance use cannot be distinguished because of
the observed significant association between trauma exposure,
substance abuse, PTSD and suicidality. Further work will be
necessary to distinguish the degree to which SKA2 is specific to
suicide biology or more broadly affects other HPA axis-associated
mental disorders such as PTSD. Future work in longitudinally
collected samples will enable a robust way to test these
hypotheses and to fully discern the cause versus effect nature of
the identified associations of SKA2 with suicidal behaviors.
