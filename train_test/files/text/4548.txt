Abstract
Objective: Adhesion molecules are involved in inflammation, atherosclerosis and malignancy. This
study measured levels of adhesion molecules before and after levothyroxine therapy in patients
with subclinical hypothyroidism (SHO).
Methods: Levels of soluble (s) intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, s vascular cell adhesion
molecule (sVCAM) VCAM-1 and sE-selectin were analysed in patients diagnosed with SHO, prior
to administration of 50 mg/day levothyroxine orally for 3 months. Subsequently, levels of sICAM-1,
sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin were reanalysed then compared with the pretreatment levels.
Results: In 30 patients with SHO, levels of sICAM-1 were found to be significantly higher than
those in healthy controls, (P ¼ 0.001). Post-treatment sICAM-1 levels were significantly lower than
pretreatment levels (P ¼ 0.001). No significant differences were found in sVCAM-1 or sE-selectin
levels between healthy controls and patients with SHO before treatment, or between patients with
SHO pre- and post-treatment.
Conclusions: Patients with SHO had significantly higher levels of sICAM-1 compared with
controls. Levels became normal after treatment with levothyroxine. These findings emphasize the
need for levothyroxine therapy in cases of SHO to normalize sICAM-1 levels. Such treatment helps
to prevent the future development of atherosclerosis or cancer.

Introduction
Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHO), which is
the most frequently seen thyroid dysfunc-
tion, encompasses various diagnoses includ-
ing mild thyroid failure, compensated
hypothyroidism, decreased thyroid reserve,
early hypothyroidism, latent hypothyroid-
ism, minimal symptomatic hypothyroidism
and preclinical hypothyroidism.1,2 SHO is a
common disorder with a prevalence ranging
between 1 and 10% among the adult popu-
lation in developed countries, as reported in
two population studies.3,4 SHO is diagnosed
by detection of elevated thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) levels (above the upper limit
of the normal range) but normal serum free-
thyroxine levels. Those with clear SHO are
either asymptomatic or demonstrate very
few clinical manifestations. The presence of
thyroid autoantibodies is an important indi-
cator for the development of SHO,5 with 20­
30% of individuals with higher TSH levels
testing seropositive for thyroid antibodies.6
Adhesion molecules are related to inflam-
matory processes including atherosclerosis,
and may be linked with low grade inflam-
mation during SHO.
A small amount of intracellular adhesion
molecule (ICAM)-1 is expressed in endothe-
lial cells. Stimulation of endothelial cells by
mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-g
and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) increases the
expression of ICAM.7 This increase in
expression is seen in cases of acute and
chronic inflammation, and in the presence of
tumour cells.8 As a consequence of such
stimulation, ICAM starts to become appar-
ent on the cell surface after 2­4 h and
continues to increase to a plateau level
after 12­16 h. If cytokines are present at
the same time, then ICAM will be expressed
for 24­72 h. ICAM-1 molecules are import-
ant for the migration of eosinophils,
T-lymphocytes and neutrophils,9 and func-
tion as important signals in interactions
between antigen-presenting cells and
T-cells. Proteolytic dissociation of the
ICAM-1 extracellular part produces its sol-
uble (sICAM-1) form. The plasma level of
this form is a direct indicator of the amount
of inflammation in disease states.8
Stimulation of cytokines such as IL-1,
IL-4 and TNF-a produces expression of
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1
on the surface of various cells 2­4 h later.
IL-4 selectively induces expression of
VCAM-1, and enables the accumulation of
eosinophils, which is mediated by very late
antigen (VLA)-4.10 VCAM molecules main-
tain migration and adhesion of leucocytes
on endothelial vessel walls. Both ICAM-
1and VCAM-1 play vital roles in the
processes of immune response and inflam-
mation. VCAM-1 binds to its ligand VLA-4,
and is found in all types of leucocytes
excluding neutrophils. The VCAM-1/VLA-
4 pathway plays a key role in the pathogen-
esis of various allergic, inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases.10
In common with VCAM, E-selectin is
not found on nonstimulated endothelial
cells. E-selectin expression increases in
response to inflammatory stimulants such
as IL-1, TNF-a or endotoxins (e.g. LPS).3 It
appears on the surface of endothelial cells
within 30 min of stimulation, and levels peak
after 2­4 h. Structurally, the first extracellu-
lar domain of E-selectin contains lectin,
while the second domain comprises an
EGF-like domain. It also contains six add-
itional cysteine-rich protein domains.5
Antibodies directly effective on E-selectin
prevent inflammation.11 The E-selectin
receptor ensures selective binding of neutro-
phils, monocytes and eosinophils to the
endothelium.
The aim of the present study was to
determine the levels of adhesion molecules
that are thought to have a role in the
development of morbidities (such as inflam-
mation, malignancy, allergy and auto-
immune disease) in patients with SHO

before levothyroxine therapy, and assess
if any changes occurred in adhesion mol-
ecule levels after 3 months' levothyroxine
treatment.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients attending the endocrinology out-
patients' clinic at Izmir Bozyaka Training
and Research Hospital, Bozyaka, Izmir,
Turkey, between September 2009 and April
2011 and diagnosed with SHO during tests
for investigation of fatigue or weight gain
were enrolled into this study. Criteria for
patients to be included in the study were
thyroid dysfunction as indicated by labora-
tory tests; age 27­60 years;
thyroid-treatment nai¨ve; no history of thy-
roid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy.
Detailed medical histories were obtained
and physical examinations were performed
on patients meeting the study criteria.
In addition, healthy volunteers (selected
from healthcare workers from Izmir
Bozyaka Research and Training Hospital
and age and sex matched to patients) were
included as a control group. Whole blood
count, biochemistry, thyroid function tests
and levels of anti-T, anti-M, sE-selectin,
sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 values were
measured.
Ethical consent for the study was received
from the Izmir Bozyaka Research and
Training Hospital Ethics Committee (refer-
ence number 358), Bozyaka, Turkey and
written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Blood measurements
Whole-blood cell counts were made using 2-
ml venous blood samples drawn into
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid tubes, and
analysed in a CELL-DYN 3700 device
(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,
USA). Blood samples collected for
evaluation of thyroid function were drawn
into anticoagulant-free tubes and incubated
at room temperature for 30 min until coagu-
lated. Samples were centrifuged at 3220 g for
5 min at room temperature; the separated
serum was analysed in an ImmuliteÕ 2000
device (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using
chemiluminencence immunochemistry
methods to measure levels of TSH, free
thyroxine (FT)3 and FT4. Reference
normal laboratory ranges for these param-
eters were: FT3, 2.5­3.9 pg/ml; FT4, 0.61­
1.06 ng/dl; TSH, 0.41­4.25 IU/ml.
The remaining separated serum from
each sample was frozen at À80C and later
used for analysis of E-selectin, sICAM-1 and
sVCAM-1 with Biosource (Bender
MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria)
E-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 kits.
No blinding of samples was undertaken
during laboratory assessment.
Treatment
Patients were prescribed 50 mg/day levothyr-
oxine, orally, for 3 months after which time
blood tests were repeated. Levothyroxine
was administered to each patient at a con-
stant dose for a fixed period of time to
standardize treatment.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Differences between levels of E-
selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were com-
pared in those with SHO before and after 3
months' treatment with levothyroxine and in
untreated controls, using a nonparametric
Wilcoxon's rank sum test. A P-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 30 patients diagnosed with SHO
(25 female; five male), were included in this
808 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
study. All patients had Hashimoto's thyr-
oiditis. The mean age of all patients was
44.28 Æ 10.13 years. There were no signifi-
cant differences in age or sex among the
control and SHO groups. Among patients
with higher TSH (>4.25 IU/ml) values,
those with normal FT3 and FT4 values
were considered to have SHO, based on
normal laboratory reference ranges.
Control, pre- and postlevothyroxine treat-
ment mean values for FT3, FT4, TSH,
E-selectin, ICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 are
shown in Table 1.
After 3 months' levothyroxine therapy,
all 30 patients were available for evaluation;
all had become euthyroid. A significant drop
in mean post-treatment TSH levels was
found in patients with SHO compared with
mean pretreatment values (P ¼ 0.004).
However, no significant difference was
observed between pre-and post-treatment
FT3 (P ¼ 0.116) and FT4 levels (P ¼ 0.927)
in patients with SHO.
Mean sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and
sVCAM-1 values are presented in Table 1.
Pretreatment sICAM-1 levels were signifi-
cantly higher in patients with SHO com-
pared with healthy controls (P ¼ 0.001),
whereas post-treatment sICAM-I levels
were significantly reduced compared
with pretreatment values (P ¼ 0.001;
Table 1, Figure 1).
There was no significant difference in
sVCAM-1 levels between healthy controls
and the pretreatment SHO group, or
between pre- and post-treatment sVCAM-1
levels in SHO patients (Table 1, Figure 2).
No significant difference was found
between pre-and post-treatment sE-selectin
levels in patients, or in levels between
healthy controls and pretreatment SHO
patients (Table 1, Figure 3).
Discussion
Thyroid disease, which is becoming increas-
ingly prevalent, both globally and locally in
Turkey, leads to the development of med-
ical problems that are mainly cardiovascu-
lar, gastrointestinal, systemic diseases,

neurological and psychiatric or psycho-
logical, and coagulopathies.10,12­15 Athero-
sclerosis is a chronic process involving both
cellular and humoral responses. In athero-
genesis, leucocytes are involved in the early
phase of atherosclerosis and maintain their
activity during plaque formation, during
which time sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 first
co-ordinate leucocyte adhesion, then their
transendothelial migration.1 Both sICAM-1
and sVCAM-1 are transmembrane glyco-
proteins that bind to b-integrins found on
the leucocyte surface. ICAM-1 is strongly
upregulated by inflammatory cytokines in
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells
and multiple haemopoietic cells. Generally,
in noninflammatory conditions, ICAM-1 is
expressed on the surface of very few cells
that might be important in the induction of
this adhesion molecule. Its role is the regu-
lation of various intercellular interactions
that generate host immune responses.
VCAM-1 is specific for mononuclear cells
and functions as a ligand with an affinity for
b 1 integrins, which are found in lympho-
cytes and monocytes. As is the case for
ICAM-1, expression of VCAM-1 is modu-
lated by many similar cytokines. However,
distribution of VCAM-1 is contained in the
activated endothelial cells in traumatized
regions, and is more frequently observed in
intimal layers of neovascular structures.
Despite structural and functional similari-
ties between ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, differ-
ences in their distribution pattern in tissues,
their receptor specificities and their
responses to haemodynamic forces are of
critical importance in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis.2 A study demonstrated that
increases in sICAM-1 levels might be pre-
dictive for myocardial infarction and
stroke.16 However, the same evaluation is
not valid for sVCAM-1.17 Investigators
have reported that endothelial activation

(P ¼ 0.538); (b) No significant difference was detected in mean sE-selectin levels between pre-and post-
treatment patients with SHO (P ¼ 0.158) (nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test).

and inflammation are important precursors
for the induction and progression of athero-
sclerosis, and have suggested that ICAM-1
and VCAM-1 may each play an independent
role in the development of peripheral
atherosclerosis.18
Adhesion process and transendothelial
migration of leucocytes are mediated by
cellular adhesion molecules (CAM). CAM
are expressed on the surface of endothelial
cells in response to various inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-a and IFN-g.
Intracellular CAM-1 and VCAM-1 are two
prototype members of the immunoglobulin
superfamily that have important roles in the
accumulation of focal leucocytes in the
subendothelial region.19 Increased plasma
levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (and their
soluble molecules) are indicators of inflam-
mation, and also seem to be risk factors for
further development of vascular occlusion in
coronary artery disease.20 E-selectin, which
is another member of the adhesion molecule
family expressed on the surface of endothe-
lial cells, enables the involvement of leuco-
cytes in inflammatory processes during an
inflammatory response.21
Adhesion molecules play important roles
in atherosclerosis and cancer. TNF-a is
important in the onset of inflammation.22
Functions of the TNF-a signal pathway are
mediated by nuclear factor-kB, which is also
responsible for the endothelial expression of
adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1.21 Increased expression of
ICAM-1 may play an important role in the
development of malignant tumours.23­25
Although hypothyroidism has been reported
to be responsible for an increased risk of
atherosclerotic heart disease, outcomes of
prospective studies are inconclusive.26,27
One study revealed an association between
SHO and atherosclerosis and myocardial
infarction in older women,26 and further
studies have claimed that levothyroxine
replacement therapy in those with manifest
or SHO has improved atherosclerotic signs
and symptoms.21,28­30 In contrast, a 20-year
follow-up study failed to find any correl-
ation between TSH levels and ischaemic
heart disease.31
Adhesion is important in the tumoural
invasion of endothelial cells, and this pro-
cess is mediated by ICAM-1 and E-selec-
tin.32,33 Generally, immune cells play a
crucial role in the suppression of tumour
metastases. ICAM-1 binds to lymphocytes
to suppress immune cell functions, acting as
an immunosuppressive substance. The cor-
relation between ICAM-1 molecules and
cancer cells, and the increase in ICAM-1
expression from cancer cells that is related to
progression or metastases, have been used to
support this view.34 The correlation between
soluble forms of adhesion molecules and
tumour­node­metastasis staging, and also
between development of metastasis in gas-
tric, colorectal and breast cancers has also
been demonstrated.24,33,35
The aim of the present study was to
determine the correlation between TSH
levels and sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and
E-selectin values in patients with SHO. In
patients with SHO, pretreatment sICAM-1
levels were found to be significantly higher
than those found in healthy controls
(P ¼ 0.0001). Post-treatment sICAM-1
levels decreased significantly (P ¼ 0.0001)
after 3 months of levothyroxine therapy. In
our study, the drop in sICAM-1 levels with
levothyroxine reflects the favourable effects
of treatment. The administration of
levothyroxine therapy to those with SHO
could prevent atherosclerotic processes and
related cardiovascular diseases, and possibly
prevent the future development of malig-
nancy. s-ICAM is an indicator of the
amount of inflammation in disease states;
it is likely that levothyroxine use reduced the
thyroid autoimmune process, as shown in
our results through the post-treatment
reduction in the sICAM-1 level.
Several potential limitations of our study
should be addressed. First, the duration of
812 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
our study was 3 months, which was very
short. Second, the pre-and post-treatment
antibody titres should have been defined in
all patients. Another possible limitation is
the fact that intima media thickness and
high density lipoprotein/low density lipo-
protein ratios were not defined, as these
would provide further links to the role of
adhesion molecules in the development
of atherosclerosis and cancer. Future studies
of longer duration, involving larger patient
populations in which carotid intima thick-
nesses are assessed, are needed.
