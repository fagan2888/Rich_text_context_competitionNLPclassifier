Changes in Perceived Weight Discrimination
Among Americans, 1995­1996 Through
2004­2006
Tatiana Andreyeva1, Rebecca M. Puhl1 and Kelly D. Brownell1
Objective: Little is known about the prevalence and patterns of weight discrimination in the United States. This study
examined the trends in perceived weight/height discrimination among a nationally representative sample of adults
aged 35­74 years, comparing experiences of discrimination based on race, age, and gender.
Methods and Procedures: Data were from the two waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development

in the United States (MIDUS), a survey of community-based English-speaking adults initially in 1995­1996 and
a follow-up in 
2004­ 2006. Reported experiences of weight/height discrimination included a variety of settings in major
lifetime events and interpersonal relationships.
Results: The prevalence of weight/height discrimination increased from 7% in 1995­1996 to 12% in 2004­2006,
affecting all population groups but the elderly. This growth is unlikely to be explained by changes in obesity rates.
Discussion: Weight/height discrimination is highly prevalent in American society and increasing at disturbing rates.
Its prevalence is relatively close to reported rates of race and age discrimination, but virtually no legal or social
sanctions against weight discrimination exist.

Overweight and obese individuals are vulnerable to negative
societal attitudes, stigma, and prejudice (1,2). Weight bias
has been documented in multiple settings including places of
employment (3,4), health-care facilities (4­6), educational insti-
tutions (7­9), and close interpersonal relationships with friends
and family -members (4). The consequences of weight bias are
significant for overweight children and adults, with both imme-
diate and potentially long-term adverse outcomes for emotional
and physical health (5,10­14).
Despite the accumulation of evidence on this topic, little is
known about the specific prevalence and patterns of weight
discrimination in the United States. Discrimination is distinct
from prejudice and negative attitudes in that it refers to unequal
treatment of people because of their membership to a particular
group (15). To date, little work has documented the prevalence
of discriminatory experiences perceived by obese individuals,
and whether this has changed over time. One exception is the
study examining the frequency of institutional and interpersonal
discrimination in a nationally representative random sample
of 3,437 adults from the 1995­1996 National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States (MIDUS) (16). Its findings
showed that compared to normal weight peers, obese persons
reported significantly more frequent daily 
discrimination,
work- and health-related discrimination. Individuals in the
highest obese categories were 40­50% more likely to report
discrimination than normal-weight persons.
To our knowledge, no other published work has documented
prevalence patterns of weight discrimination in the United
States, and important questions remain. First, no longitudi-
nal investigations have been conducted to determine whether
rates of weight discrimination have changed over time. Second,
it is informative to understand the prevalence of weight dis-
crimination compared to other forms such as race and gender
discrimination to place it in a social context for discussions of
bias-prevention programs, possible legal remedies, and more.
In contrast to more widely recognized social stigmas such as
gender or race that have legal sanctions in place to protect
individuals from discrimination, there are no federal laws to
prohibit weight discrimination, and it is unknown how weight
discrimination compares in strength or prevalence to discrimi-
nation based on these attributes. Examining the vulnerabi
lity of individuals to discrimination based on weight vs. other
attributes will be important to determine the scope of inter-
vention and legal remedies potentially needed to address this
societal issue. Comparing trends in perceptions of discrimina-
tion due to weight vs. characteristics such as gender or race can

help further our understanding of changes across stigmatized
groups over time (e.g., whether certain stigmas are worsening or

stabilizing) and outline important research questions concern-
ing the 
reasons for potential shifts over time and interventions
that may be warranted to help prevent further stigma.
This study evaluates the trends in perceived weight discrimi-
nation in the United States over 10 years and compares the
prevalence of weight discrimination to rates of discrimination
for race, gender, and age. Data were drawn from a nationally
representative random sample of American adults in the MIDUS
core sample, comparing the first wave of data (from 1995 to
1996) to the second wave of data collected in 2004­2006.
Methods And Procedures
Sample
The MIDUS is an interdisciplinary study of behavioral, psychological,
and social factors involved in midlife health and well-being. The base-
line data were collected in 1995­1996 (MIDUS I) and a follow-up of
the original sample (MIDUS II) was conducted in 2004­2006, with
data collection in MIDUS II largely repeating baseline assessments.
Respondents (aged 25­74 years) in 1995 were drawn from a nation-
ally representative multistage probability sample of community-
based English-speaking adults in the coterminous United States. In
the first stage, participating households were selected from working
telephone banks via random digit dialing. In the second stage, indi-
vidual respondents were selected using disproportionate stratified
sampling. Elderly individuals (ages 65­74) and men were oversampled
along with oversampling in five metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco). Those quarried in the survey
participated in an initial telephone interview and completed a self-
administered mail questionnaire. The response rate for the telephone
interview in MIDUS I was 70%; among the telephone respondents,
86.8% completed the mail questionnaire, so that the overall survey
response rate was 60.8% (17).
Our study uses data from the random core sample of the MIDUS
in both waves (the Main Data) (MIDUS I is from the 2006 Release
(2006/03/30). The most recent version of the MIDUS I data was released
on 2007/04/16. MIDUS II is from the original and most recent release on
2007/03/22). The baseline 1995­1996 MIDUS study included data from
three subsample data sets: the Main Data (N = 4,242 with 3,485 national
random core sample participants and 757 metropolitan oversamples),
the Twins Data (N = 1,996 twins), and the Siblings Data (N = 1,614 pairs
with 951 participants drawn from the Main Data). Among the original
7,190 MIDUS I participants, 842 participants refused to participate in
a 2004­2006 follow-up, and 1,334 could not be successfully contacted
(including 421 confirmed deceased). Thus, 70% of the original MIDUS
sample participated in the second wave of 2004­2006 (ages 35­86).
The survey assessed physical and psychological health throughout the
respondent's adult life, substance abuse, well-being, personal beliefs,
socioeconomic status, social support, and various forms of perceived
discrimination. Further details on the MIDUS data and methodology
are available elsewhere (17,18).
Our study uses data from the MIDUS national random sample of the
participants who completed at least the telephone survey. We limited
our analyses to adults aged 35­74 in both waves to make data compa-
rable across waves. We therefore excluded respondents who were 25­34
years old in the first MIDUS wave (1995­1996) and who were 75 years
and older in the second wave (2004­2006). Further exclusion criteria
included individuals with incomplete or inconsistent data on discrimi-
nation-related questions (e.g., reporting a cause for discrimination but
no discriminatory experiences, citing experiences of discrimination but
giving no reason for discrimination). As a result of all exclusions, our
analytic sample for the 1995­1996 wave included 1,826 individuals, and
the 2004­2006 sample included 1,136 respondents.
Our study objectives aimed to (i) determine how the prevalence of
weight/height discrimination among US adults changed between the
two time periods of 1995­1996 and 2004­2006 (while also examining
contributors to the observed trends in weight/height discrimination),
and (ii) compare changes over time across different forms of discrimi-
nation. We treated the data from the two MIDUS waves as two cross-
sections. We did not examine discrimination exposure among the same
respondents 10 years apart, because our aim was to capture patterns of
discrimination over time for an average representative American adult.
Limiting the trend analysis to participants who experienced discrimi-
nation in the first wave of data collection and tracking their discrimina-
tory experiences over a decade would provide only a partial snapshot of
trends in weight discrimination for adults in the United States.
Measure of discrimination
The MIDUS survey evaluates self-perceived discriminatory experi-
ences by asking participants to report occurrences of discrimination
over their lifetime and on a day-to-day basis. The survey asks about
the primary reason for discrimination allowing participants to report
multiple reasons if applicable. Specifically, the survey asks "What was
the main reason for the discrimination you experienced? If more than
one reason, circle all that apply" with response choices including "Your
Age, Gender, Race, Height or weight, Ethnicity or nationality, Physical
disability, Some aspect of appearance other than weight or height, Sexual
orientation, Religion, and Other reason."
The key variable in our study is perceived discrimination due to the
respondent's weight or height. Because the survey used one category
for body size discrimination combining height and weight, we refer
to this variable as weight/height discrimination throughout the paper.
We compared average body weight, height, and BMI (defined as weight
in kilogram relative to height in meters squared) between the partici-
pants reporting weight/height discrimination and the rest of the sample
to test whether weight was more likely to be a source of discrimination
than height. On average, body weight and BMI were significantly higher
among people reporting weight/height discrimination relative to other
participants in both samples (e.g., BMI of 34 vs. 26, P < 0.01 in 1995­
1996, and BMI of 35 vs. 28 in 2004­2006, P < 0.01). At the same time,
there was no difference in both samples in the average height of women
by weight/height discrimination, so that a short body stature was unlikely
to be a source of weight/height discrimination. Body height among men
was on average slightly higher in the group reporting weight/height dis-
crimination (P < 0.10), so that a short stature is an unlikely cause of
weight/height discrimination among men. We therefore have reason-
able evidence to believe that the reported experiences of discrimination
due to weight or height are reflective of higher body weight and obesity
rather than height.
We examined lifetime experiences of discrimination in major settings
such as employment, medical care, and education as well as interpersonal
discrimination on a day-to-day basis. Lifetime experiences were self-
reported in the question: "How many times in your life have you been
discriminated against in each of the following ways because of such things
as your race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, physical appearance, sexual
orientation, or other characteristics? (If the experience happened to you,
but for some reason other than discrimination, enter "0")." Eleven ways
of lifetime discrimination were evaluated, including: "discouraged by a
teacher or advisor from seeking higher education," "denied a scholarship,"
"not hired for a job," "not given a job promotion," "fired," "prevented from
renting or buying a home in the neighborhood you wanted," "prevented from
remaining in a neighborhood because neighbors made life uncomfortable,"
"hassled by the police," "denied a bank loan," "denied or provided inferior
medical care," and "denied or provided inferior service by a plumber, car
mechanic, or another service provider." Discrimination in interpersonal
experiences on a day-to-day basis was evaluated with the question: "How
often on a day-to-day basis do you experience each of the following types
of discrimination?" with nine response items including: "you are treated
with less courtesy than other people," "you are treated with less respect than
other people," "you receive poorer service than other people at restaurants
obesity | VOLUME 16 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2008 1131

behavior and psychology
or stores," "people act as if they are afraid of you," "people act as if they
think you are dishonest," "people act as if they think you are not as good as
they are," "you are called names or insulted," and "you are threatened or
harassed." Participants indicated how often they had experienced these
situations using these categories: "Often," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never."
In both survey waves, we constructed a dichotomous variable of
perceived discrimination indicating whether an individual reported
occurrences of any types of discrimination (e.g., work-related dis-
crimination, personal insults). Multiple and single occurrences of dis-
crimination were weighted equally so that a person reporting a single
occurrence of discrimination (e.g., in the form of "denied or provided
inferior medical care") would be treated equally in our discrimination
measure as someone who reported several discriminatory experiences
(e.g., by "not given a job promotion"). We coded responses "Often" or
"Sometimes" in the question about daily discrimination as an indicator
of discrimination. We also constructed measures of lifetime discrimi-
nation exposure and daily interpersonal discrimination indicating any
occurrences of lifetime discrimination or discrimination in personal
relationships, respectively.
Statistical analysis
We conducted comparative analyses of the prevalence of different
forms of discrimination and forms of discrimination across population
groups in both waves of data. Stratifying by age, race, education, marital
status, weight status, and occupation, we performed a t-test for each
characteristic to evaluate the hypothesis that rates of discrimination
in the group remained unchanged between the two waves (reporting
P values). Similarly, we used a t-test to compare rates of discrimination
between men and women across groups in each survey wave. We also
compared sociodemographic characteristics and weight distribution of
the samples in both waves and tested for differences in these attributes
between the samples. To account for the complex sampling design and
to obtain nationally representative estimates, we used individual sample
weights in presenting sample statistics.
Results
The prevalence of weight/height discrimination in US adults
went up from 7.3% in 1995­1996 to 12.2% in 2004­2006, dem-
onstrating a significant increase of 66% (P < 0.01). Growth in
weight/height discrimination rates affected virtually all popu-
lation groups except the elderly. On average, 15.5% of women
reported discriminatory experiences due to weight/height in
2004­2006 vs. 10% in 1995­1996 (P < 0.01), whereas the prev-
alence for men increased from 4.1 to 8.1% (P < 0.05). Rates
of growth in weight/height discrimination among blacks, indi-
viduals who did not complete high school, older people, and
people in certain professions, (clerks/sales and those in service
occupations) were not significantly different between the two
survey waves (Table 1).
Exposure to weight/height discrimination in interpersonal
relationships on a daily basis became increasingly important over
the past decade. Reports of discrimination due to weight/height
in 2004­2006 more often applied to interpersonal relationships
rather than institutional settings such as employment. The aver-
age number of lifetime discriminatory experiences due to weight/
height increased during 1995­2006 from 4.6 to 4.9 experiences
(after excluding outliers with values above the 95% range). This
suggests that not only more people experiencing weight/height
discrimination in 2004­2006 compared to the mid-1990s, but
also that the intensity of discriminatory experiences increased in
both interpersonal and institutional settings.
The rising trend in perceived discrimination was observed in
all forms of discrimination except race, which declined slightly
over the past decade (see Figure 1). Gender remained the most
prevalent source of perceived discrimination increasing from
15.8% in 1995­1996 to 18.7% in 2004­2006 (P < 0.10). Age
discrimination replaced race as the second most common cause
of perceived discriminatory experiences, increasing from 10
to 14% (P < 0.01). Whereas higher rates of age discrimination
may reflect a somewhat older sample in the second MIDUS
wave (mean age of 52 in 2004­2006 vs. 50 in 1995­1996,

behavior and psychology
P < 0.01), changes in body weight and obesity of the partici-
pants in two samples do not seem to explain the increasing
trend in weight/height discrimination. Also, we found no
significant increase in rates of weight/height discrimination
between 1995­1996 and 2004­2006 for overweight and obese

respondents (see Table 1).
Table 2 links trends in obesity and weight/height discrimina-
tion by providing data from the two assessments on the pro-
portion of specific BMI ranges, mean BMI, and the prevalence
of weight/height discrimination in each BMI range. Similar to
national data presented elsewhere (19­22), obesity prevalence
among the MIDUS participants increased notably since the mid
1990s. For instance, 60% of the respondents aged 35­74 were
overweight or obese (BMI  25) in 1995­1996, but their share
increased to 70% 10 years later (P < 0.01). As documented else-
where (23,24), growth rates were particularly high among the
more extreme BMI categories, increasing by 15% for individuals
with BMI of 30­35, by 70% for people with BMI  35, and more
than tripling for those with BMI 45.
We tested the hypothesis that the observed growth in weight/
height discrimination was driven by the increased spread of
obesity comparing rates of weight/height discrimination in
narrowly defined BMI groups. Between BMI of 27 and 40,
the rate of weight/height discrimination increased notably
for people with similar BMI levels with a single exception of
the BMI range of 29­31. Although the average BMI in each
BMI range remained stable (except for the extreme category
of BMI  45), the prevalence of weight/height discrimination
increased over the past 10 years in each BMI range for people
with BMI of 27­29 and BMI of 31­40. Only among respon-
dents at the most extreme right tail of the BMI distribution
did the rates of discrimination go down despite an increase in
the group average BMI. However, the small sample size for the
highest BMI range (especially in the MIDUS II data set) makes
it difficult to interpret the findings, and these estimates should
be read with caution.
We also ruled out the hypothesis that the aging of the sample
and weight gain with age may explain increased rates of weight/
height discrimination. Discrimination rates due to weight/
height went up in all age groups but ages 65­74, with a particular
increase among people aged 35­40. Given that much of weight/
height discrimination occurs in younger population groups, it
is unlikely that aging can explain much of the rising trend in
weight-related discriminatory experiences.
Among 11 forms of discrimination that we examined, a sig-
nificant increase in the rates of discrimination in 2004­2006 was
reported for gender discrimination (women only), any reason
for discrimination (men), some aspect of appearance other than
weight or height (women), age discrimination, and other causes
of discrimination.
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the prevalence of weight/
height discrimination longitudinally in a national sample of
American adults. Findings showed that weight/height discrim-
ination has significantly increased between 1995­1996 and
2004­2006, from 7 to 12%. During this time, perceived race dis-
crimination remained stable, whereas the prevalence of weight/
height discrimination increased to levels comparable with those
reported for race and age discrimination. Overall, there was
not a significant or consistent increase across all other forms of

discrimination between 1995­1996 and 2004­2006, suggesting
that the observed increasing trend in weight/height discrimina-
tion cannot be attributed to a study-specific artifact.
Several interpretations are possible for the increased rates of
perceived weight/height discrimination observed in this study.
One hypothesis is that rates of obesity escalated during the same
time period of rising trends in weight/height discrimination. We
addressed this hypothesis by examining changes in discrimina-
tion within BMI categories over the past decade and revealing
increases in weight-attributed discrimination at approximately
the same levels of weight. A second possible explanation is that
perceived weight discrimination could reflect experiences that
have resulted from worsening societal attitudes and weight
stigma. In this regard, our findings support experimental
research assessing stigmatizing attitudes toward obese individu-
als, which has documented an increase in the stigmatization of
obesity over time (25).
A third possibility is that the media may play a contributing
role in the observed increases in weight bias. A recent study that
assessed framing of obesity in American news coverage from
1985 to 2003 reported a fivefold increase in media attention to
obesity since 1992 (26). One of the primary competing mes-
sage frames in this national news coverage was the emphasis of
obesity as a problem of personal responsibility, pointing to indi-
vidualistic solutions rather than larger environmental or soci-
etal changes. Although research has challenged this notion and
illustrated the complex interaction of biology, genetics, and the
environment as important contributors to weight gain (27,28),
the view that obesity stems from individual choice remains com-
mon. Sociocultural messages reinforcing the notion of personal
responsibility for weight gain are also evident from the diet
industry, which relies on framing obesity as a problem requir-
ing individual solutions through various weight loss products.
Annual revenues for the US diet industry in 1995 were $33.3 bil-
lion (29), and increased to more than $55 billion in 2006 (30).
The link between perceptions of personal responsibility for
obesity and expressions of weight bias has been convincingly
demonstrated in experimental research, and may help to explain
increases in perceived weight discrimination. Providing people
with information that emphasizes personal responsibility for
obesity worsens negative stereotypes and stigma toward obese
persons (31). In addition, obese individuals are more likely to
be blamed and negatively stereotyped when they are perceived
to be personally responsible for their weight gain, but receive
more favorable evaluations and less blame when obesity can
be attributed to a physical cause outside of personal control
(32­37). Thus, attributions about personal responsibility for
obesity, whether perpetuated by media coverage or by diet
industry marketing, could potentially contribute to higher lev-
els of weight bias and perceived discrimination. Future work
is needed to help clarify these and other potential reasons for
increasing rates of weight discrimination and to develop means
for reducing bias.
There are several limitations to this study. First, the
MIDUS survey combined weight and height in one category
of 
discrimination cause, preventing separation of these two

variables; however, given a significantly higher average weight
and BMI, but not shorter height, among the MIDUS partici-
pants reporting weight/height discrimination, it is expected
that the category primarily reflected discrimination due to
weight. Second, body weight and height in this sample were self-
reported, and analyses were based on self-reported perceptions
of weight/height discrimination rather than actual observed
behaviors of discrimination. Finally, we excluded a portion of
the MIDUS sample due to data limitations. However, the lack
of systematic differences found in key characteristics of the
excluded and included participants suggests that such exclu-
sions were unlikely to bias the results.
The results of this study highlight several new and important
findings about weight discrimination in the United States. This
problem appears to be worsening over time, and has become
comparable in prevalence to other forms of discrimination, such
as race and age, which are protected under Federal legislation.
Given that no federal legislation (and only one state law) exists
to prohibit weight discrimination, it is concerning that so many
overweight and obese individuals are vulnerable to discrimina-
tion and its harmful consequences and have no legal protection.
National actions are needed to protect this population and to
reduce bias and stigma associated with obesity.
