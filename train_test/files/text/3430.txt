Controversy rages over the consequences of extending poll
hours to make voting more convenient. Academics debate
how much such accessibility measures affect turnout (e.g.
Gronke et al., 2008; Springer, 2012), while policymakers
and judges grapple with the effects of extended hours for
partisan or discriminatory aims. Such discussions have
focused more on the number of hours voting is available
than on the specific hours that are chosen. This is some-
what surprising, as poll-opening hours vary substantially
across and within countries; changing voting hours may
change accessibility for different groups. Age, in particu-
lar, is implicated. Older populations typically prefer rela-
tively earlier schedules; the proportion of younger voters
may accordingly decrease when poll-opening hours are
earlier in the day.
This hypothesis is tested below using data from along
the time-zone border that divides Kentucky. Eastern Time
Zone areas, where the polls open and close an hour earlier
relative to the sun, see significantly higher turnout among
older populations and lower turnout among younger pop-
ulations. This has implications for election results and for
equality in ballot-box access as populations age across the
rich world (Burden et al., 2017). More pointedly, though,
given the divergent partisan and policy preferences of vot-
ers of different age groups, these results suggest that
choice of polling hours may influence substantive politi-
cal outcomes in ways readily manipulated by electoral
rule-makers (Dassonneville et al., 2017).
Age and active hours
Biology provides reason to expect earlier polling hours
to affect the electorate's age distribution. One of chronobi-
ology's most consistent findings is that age correlates
positively with "morningness"--i.e. being a morning
person--and negatively with "eveningness" (Adan et al.,
2012; Carrier et al., 1997; Tankova et al., 1994). Indeed,
older people typically perform better on cognitive tasks
earlier in the day, while younger people, if anything,
reverse this pattern (Schmidt et al., 2007). This helps older
people to muster the energy for voting earlier in the solar
day, so that having polls open more in the mornings and
less in the evenings is more congenial for older than for
younger would-be voters.
Older people's greater tendency to be (semi-)retired from
the workforce further increases their flexibility to vote dur-
ing the day, putting less pressure on the post-work evening
hours. In jurisdictions where election days are not holidays
or during weekends, working (or preparing for the workday)
typically crowds younger voting-age populations' sched-
ules. Given the widespread preference for voting during

times manipulates voter demographics

Abstract
People vary in their preferred times of day for activity. Notably, as individuals age, their daily energy and attention
typically peaks earlier in the day. When voting is permitted may then affect voters' age distribution, even when holding
constant the number of hours polls are open. Data from along the time-zone border in Kentucky, where poll-availability
hours vary, supports this hypothesis: places where voting hours are later see higher turnout rates among younger voters
and lower turnout rates among older voters. The one-hour delay in voting hours reduces older registrants' turnout, and
boosts younger registrants', by roughly three percentage points.

daylight hours (Rallings et al., 2003),1 full-time workers on
a typical daytime shift will, compared with others, see rela-
tively greater expansion of voting opportunities by having
more polling hours later in the day.
These theories primarily relate to solar time: circadian
rhythms and increased voting before sunset respond to the
timing of daylight ("sun time"), not the numbers on a clock
("clock time").2 This is not to say that behavior ignores
clock time. Potential turnout influences such as television
schedules follow the clock, not the sun, and could also con-
nect to age-related variations in turnout. For example, age
correlates with more television-watching and less use of
time-shifting technology like digital video recorders (Mares
and Woodard, 2006). Clock time's effects are, however,
analytically separable from those of solar time, even though
in most contexts sun time and clock time are essentially
interchangeable. Continuing with the television example,
time-zone boundaries do not necessarily correspond to tel-
evision market areas, so that broadcasts at a fixed clock
time may reach audiences at varying solar times.3
Previous studies have hinted that, within given polling
hours, younger voters disproportionately show up rela-
tively later in the day (Brown et al., 2006; Busch and
Lieske, 1985). Of course, patterns observed within a given
period of hours need not extend outside that period, and
comparing turnout across different elections is complicated
by the vast range of election-administration and candidate-
or party-related factors that change voters' age distribution
(Blais and Rubenson, 2013; Herron and Smith, 2013;
Pomante and Schraufnagel, 2015). Any single election,
conversely, typically shows little variation in poll-opening
hours--but the exceptional cases where election hours vary
for different voters can provide empirical traction on the
hypothesis linking votes earlier in the (solar) day to dispro-
portionately older voting populations.
Kentucky's time-zone borderland
One such case can be found in the US state of Kentucky.
Different parts of the state diverge in their poll-opening
times. In particular, Kentucky polling hours extend from
6:00 AM to 6:00 PM according to local clock time. As the
eastern part of the state lies in the Eastern Time Zone and
the western part of the state is in the Central Time Zone,
voting in eastern parts of Kentucky begins and ends an
hour earlier.
The region just on either side of Kentucky's time-zone
boundary therefore allows observation of the effects of
solar time distinct from that of clock time, and serves as a
relatively clean quasi-experimental set-up for empirical
analysis (Holmes, 1998; Keele and Titiunik, 2015, 2016;
Mattingly, 2017). The time-zone boundary does not follow
natural barriers such as rivers or mountain ranges that might
lead to stark differentiation between territories on either
side of the border. Instead, it separates areas that are
demographically, culturally, and economically similar, with
no statistically significant differences in observable charac-
teristics such as population density or poverty rates (though
such factors are further considered as potential confound-
ing factors below). Both sides of the border, importantly,
also vote for most of the same races in any given elections:
not only do all statewide votes span the time-zone border,
so too do most of the region's state-legislative seats and, to
a somewhat lesser extent, those to the federal Congress.4
Focusing on areas near the border minimizes contextual
differences across larger geographical areas, then, and pro-
vides generally similar background conditions and races at
issue--while having voting hours that are, relative to the
sun, 1 hour later in the western part of the state. Figure 1
maps the counties along the time-zone border in Kentucky.
For most5 election years since 1998, Kentucky pro-
vides turnout rates among registered voters6 for each
county in each of five age groups: those under 25 years of
age; those 25 to 34; those 35 to 49; those 50 to 61; and
those 62 and over. Even though casting a ballot is an indi-
vidual-level choice and county-level (or, more precisely,
county-age group-year-level) data is aggregated, using it
raises few risks of ecological inference, as each individual
registrant in a county is matched with certainty to polls
with known opening hours. This demographic informa-
tion about voters is released only for counties, not for
units with finer geographical grain such as precincts.
Though there are advantages of considering narrower or
wider bands on either side of a discontinuity (Arai and
Ichimura, 2016; Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2012), this
data limitation means that the analysis here considers vot-
ers within roughly 40 km of the time-zone border.7
The quasi-experimental set-up reduces the need for con-
trol variables, though aggregating across elections does
necessitate controlling for races being contested. This is
especially true in Kentucky, where state-level offices--
including the governorship--are elected in odd-numbered
years, separately from all the even-year, federal elections.
Furthermore, different parts of Kentucky's time-zone bor-
der region are in different congressional districts and so

face differing elections for the House of Representatives.
Accordingly, all models use congressional district-year
fixed effects.
Results
Table 1 reports models estimating turnout as predicted by
the variables discussed above, including models treating
the categorical age-group variable as ordered, evenly
spaced categories (in Columns I and III) and as a battery of
dummy variables (in other columns). The dependent varia-
ble is percent of registrants in a given county-year-age
group who vote. This variable is most often predicted using
ordinary least-squares linear regression, which for ease of
interpretation is retained in Table 1's Columns I and II.
However, turnout percentage is constrained to being
between 0% and 100%, and theory suggests nonlinear
effects: if 95% of a population was going to vote anyway,
an additional factor that encourages voting will probably
have a smaller effect than if only 50% would otherwise
vote. This is accounted for by using generalized linear
model with a binomial link function, analogous to a logistic
regression model but predicting outcomes over the range of
potential percentages. Columns III and IV report these gen-
eralized models.
Being in the Central Time Zone, with its later voting
hours relative to solar noon, associates with higher turnout
for the baseline group (registered voters under the age of
25). That effect of later voting, however, interacts with age;
progressively older groups see smaller turnout increases
from being in the Central rather than Eastern Time Zone.
Indeed, among the oldest age group, with potential voters
aged at least 62, turnout is higher in the Eastern Time Zone.
This interaction between age and time zone is consistent
across all six models, and meets standard thresholds for sta-
tistical significance. It is also substantively appreciable,
implying that the effect of the later hour of voting differs by
approximately six percentage points between the youngest
and oldest groups.
Figure 2 illustrates this graphically, using predictions
from Table 1's Columns II (in the left panel) and IV (in
the right panel), leaving district-year as-is when calcu-
lating the predicted value. For each age group, the pre-
dicted turnout for a county on the Central Time Zone
side of the border is denoted with a solid circle, while the
hollow circles show predicted turnout on the Eastern
Time Zone side of the border. As the figure shows, turn-
out is essentially indistinguishable across the time-zone
boundary for those between the ages of 35 and 61. For
the two youngest groups, though, Central Time Zone
counties saw turnout rates three to five percentage points
higher, while among the most senior voters, Eastern
Time Zone counties' turnout was approximately three
percentage points higher. While these differences are
dwarfed by the underlying differences in turnout across
age groups (Binstock, 2000; Persson et al., 2013), they

do appreciably shape electorate demographics. Indeed,
the implied effect size of this 1-hour shift in voting hours
is roughly comparable to that seen when changing other
convenience-voting measures such as voter-identification
requirements or election-day registration (Hood and
Bullock, 2012; Neiheisel and Burden, 2012). By having
these effects not on aggregate turnout but on specific
demographic groups, though, Table 1's results suggest
larger effects on election outcomes than would broader-
based shifts in turnout.
Moreover, the relationship between time zone and
turnout behaves as one might expect in other respects.
Consider, for instance, how elections' importance might
modulate Table 1's effects. Polling hours that are uncon-
genial for members of an age group might especially be
expected to dissuade members of that group from casting
ballots in elections perceived to be low-stakes, even if
those group members think it worth the effort to turn out
for higher-stakes votes. This suggests that one might
expect time-zone effects on different age groups to be
smaller in higher-stakes elections: in low-stakes votes,
only people whose scheduling preferences coincide with
local voting hours cast ballots, while in higher-stakes
situations, citizens of all ages cast ballots. Results in the
Appendix show this to hold true; while older voters see
relatively higher turnout with earlier voting hours in all
elections, the effects are larger in non-presidential years,
when most Americans find voting and elections less
pressing. The Appendix also shows that, within age
groups, partisan orientation generally does not affect
propensity to vote depending on time zone. Since there
is little theoretical reason to expect Democrats to differ
from Republicans in morningness, this serves as a pla-
cebo test of the hypothesized mechanism.
Are county characteristics
responsible?
While proximity likely makes counties on either side of the
border similar, the quasi-experimental design might be
questioned. Any consistent southwest-to-northeast gradient
in economic or cultural geography would correlate with the
time-zone treatment. This section explores whether con-
trolling for contextual characteristics affects the previous
section's results. Because few such variables are available
at the level of the county-age group, these models' unit of
analysis is the county-year. The dependent variable accord-
ingly becomes the difference in turnout rates between the
oldest and youngest age groups; an alternative reported
specification uses differences between the youngest two
and oldest two groups.
Several factors potentially encourage the turnout of
younger rather than older registrants. Many of these are
demographic. Local preponderance of a particular age
group may create greater collective-action difficulties in
mobilizingthatgrouptovote(Morrison,2014).Conversely,
locally predominant populations may have the clout to
make it easier for their members to vote, as by getting poll-
ing places near a university or retirement community.
Census Bureau estimates of the percentage of a county-
year's population that is younger than 25, and the percent-
age that is 65 or older, account for these possibilities.8

intervals.

The Census Bureau further reports the ethnic distribu-
tion of different ethnic and racial groups in each county, in
particular the shares of Blacks and Hispanics. Ethnic or
racial features may affect propensity to mobilize (Holbrook
et al., 2016; Uhlaner and Scola, 2016), so that any correla-
tion between age distributions and ethnic mix--likely,
given ongoing demographic shifts--might produce seem-
ingly age-related effects that instead reflect ethnic-group
effects. Measures used to control for this are the percent-
ages of the population that are Black (alone or in conjunc-
tion with other races, regardless of Hispanic status) and
Hispanic (of all races), respectively.
Economic factors may also affect different age groups'
turnout. For example, consider population density. A
denser, more urban population distribution likely reduces
most voters' distance to their polling place. Such proximity
to the polls varies in its effects on turnout to the extent vot-
ers of different age groups diverge in their degree of mobil-
ity (Haspel and Knotts, 2005). This is measured with
population density, with a logarithmic transformation to
reduce variable skew. Unemployment and local incomes
also correlate with both age and electoral participation rates
(Burden and Wichowsky, 2014; Choi et al., 2015); income
is measured here using Census estimates of median house-
hold income deflated to 2010 dollars.
Table 2 brings these variables together in ordinary least-
squares models with panel-corrected standard errors and, as
with Table 1, congressional district-year fixed effects. The
table's first column predicts differences in turnout between
the oldest and youngest registrant categories, while the
second column aggregates the youngest two and oldest two
categories.
In both models, being in the Central Time Zone again
associates with a smaller gap in turnout between younger and
older registrants. Being on the western side of the time-zone
border appears to reduce the turnout gap across age groups by
one-and-a-half to two percentage points. The effect continues
to attain standard benchmarks of statistical significance, and
is roughly comparable in magnitude to the predicted effect of
increasing population density by one standard deviation.
Conclusion
Making poll-opening hours earlier or later may change the
age distribution of voters: when polls are open earlier in the
solar day, turnout increases among older but decreases
among younger voters. This is true despite the difference in
voting hours here, shifted by a mere hour on either side of a
time-zone boundary, being relatively small in the universe
of plausible voting hours; the logic of how different groups
react to time extends to later plausible voting hours as well.
That is, although the case examined here cannot directly
test the claim, presumably the difference between opening
a 12-hour polling day at 6:00 AM and opening it at 8:30
AM would be somewhat larger than that examined here.
Those concerned about ensuring equal ballot access, or
about predicting (or altering) electoral turnout, may accord-
ingly find it fruitful to consider not just how many hours
voting is allowed in, or on what day those hours are, but
also to what time of day the hours involve. Such concerns
may extend beyond young or old voters. Income may relate
to casting a ballot earlier in the day, perhaps because higher-
income jobs offer more flexible work schedules (Fuchs and
Becker, 1968). Poorer or richer voters may then comprise a
larger share of voters depending on the hours that polls are
open, with potential implications for representation, elec-
toral outcomes, and exit-poll interpretation. Future research
can explore such other demographic dimensions.
It may also examine the effects of poll-availability times
in other places and contexts. Kentucky is somewhat unusual
in the earliness of its voting hours: 6 AM to 6 PM leaves
relatively little time for those with a typical working day to
vote on their way home. The age-and-turnout effects of
shifting polling times may vary in size for places that have
later, or shorter, voting hours. Other features of electoral
administration may matter as well. Varying access to postal
balloting, for example, may shape how dependent would-be
voters are on election-day polling hours. So, too, might the
season of the election and the polling location's latitude and
longitude; these features affect solar-time benchmarks.
The results here fit in with recent scholarly recognition
that time is not fungible in its voting impact. Context can
make the minutes needed to vote seem more or less costly
(Gibson et al., 2013; Newman et al., 2014). As time is
often central to the cost side of political participation's

cost-benefit decision calculus, taking such temporal factors
seriously is likely to improve understanding of many impor-
tant political behaviors. The findings also emphasize the
degree to which the decision to vote may be contingent on
circumstances on election day itself. The effects observed
here suggest that the decision to vote for marginal voters (as
opposed to habitual ones) depends on mood, attention, and
energy at the time when voting is possible rather than long-
term planning. This may contribute to the difficulties of
forecasting who will vote (Rogers and Aida, 2014). Better
understanding how circumstances like time and context
affect propensity to vote can help allay these difficulties.

Notes
1. Cooler evening conditions could trigger the varying will-
ingness to vote that people exhibit at different temperatures
(Eisinga et al., 2012; Lamare, 2013), especially because age
affects reactions to temperature (Mishra and Ramgopal, 2013).
2. Divergence between clock and sun time can itself result from
political calculations (Hassid and Watson, 2014).
3. In the Kentucky case examined below, the primary broad-
cast-market areas (Louisville and Lexington) both span the
time-zone boundary that determines poll-opening times.

at its southern end with the time-zone border.
