ABSTRACT
Background: It is not known whether the improved folate status
from mandatory folic acid fortification had any impact on indexes
and prevalence of anemias in the United States.
Objective: We investigated trends in indexes and prevalence of
anemia and macrocytosis with a focus on comparison of prefortifi-
cation data with postfortification data.
Design: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
and prevalences and likelihood of anemia and macrocytosis were
determined for 26,596 adults examined in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys, 1988­2004.
Results: From 1988­1994 to 1999­2004, hemoglobin modestly but
significantly improved from 15.1 to 15.4 g/dL ('2.0%; P , 0.0001)
and from 13.3 to 13.6 g/dL ('2.3%; P , 0.0001) in men and
women, respectively. There was a significant increase in MCV from
1988­1994 to 1999­2004 in men (from 90.2 to 90.7; P ¼ 0.0123)
and older (.60 y) men (from 91.6 to 92.4; P ¼ 0.0105) and in
women (from 90.7 to 91.4; P ¼ 0.0141). Only in women was the
prevalence of anemia significantly lower in 1999­2004 than in
1988­1994 (27.9% reduction; P ¼ 0.0005). The odds of having
anemia in the postfortification period relative to the prefortification
period was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.75; P , 0.0001) in women and
0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.99; P , 0.0433) in men. In general, the
prevalence of macrocytosis and the odds of having macrocytosis
did not change significantly from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004.
Conclusion: The improvement in hemoglobin and the decreased
prevalence of anemia from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004, especially
in women, may be attributable to improved folate status, increased
vitamin/mineral supplements use, and other unknown causes after
the initiation of folic acid fortification. The cause of increased
MCV in men, and in older persons of both sexes, warrants further
investigation. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;89:363­71.
INTRODUCTION
The Food and Drug Administration mandated that all pro-
cessed cereal and cereal products be fortified with folic acid at the
level of 140 g/100 g of cereal product in the United States by 1
January 1998 (1). This legislation was in response to the Public
Health Service's recommendation that all women who are ca-
pable of getting pregnant should consume 400 lg folic acid/d to
reduce the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD)
(2). The predicted increase in intake of folic acid was 100 g/d by
the target population (1). However, the actual intake of folic acid
after folic acid fortification has exceeded the projected intake
(3, 4) because several fortified foods contain higher amounts of
folic acid than the amount required by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration regulation (5). Since folic acid fortification began,
the prevalence of NTDs has decreased by 19% in the United
States (6). Additionally, folic acid fortification has significantly
improved circulating folate and red blood cell folate concen-
trations (7­11) and has lowered circulating total homocysteine
concentrations (7, 8, 12, 13).
Because folic acid supplementation cures folate deficiency­
induced macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia (macrocytosis),
we hypothesized that folic acid fortification would have
a positive impact on indexes of anemia and the prevalence of
anemia, especially macrocytosis, in the United States. No data
on the possible impact of folic acid fortification on indicators
of anemia or the prevalence of overall anemia and macrocy-
tosis have been published. From a public health perspective, it
is important to monitor the impact of nationwide folic acid
fortification efforts on the overall health and well being of US
residents on a continuous basis because the actual consump-
tion of folic acid from food fortification has exceeded the
predicted intake (3, 4).
The National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention conducts cross-sectional Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
on civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United States.
NHANES 1988­1994 was conducted before mandatory folic acid
fortification commenced and NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
and 2003­2004 were conducted after folic acid fortification
began. Data collected in these 4 NHANES cycles allowed us to
evaluate changes in health indexes of the US population from the
time of initiation of folic acid fortification (1988­1994) to a pe-
riod of time after folic acid fortification began (1999­2004).

In this report, we present trends in indexes of anemia and
prevalence estimates of overall anemia and macrocytosis in var-
ious demographic categories of the US population using data from
nationally representative sample surveys (NHANESs) conducted
before folic acid fortification (1988-1994) and after folic acid
fortification (1999-2004). Additionally, the impact of folic acid
fortification on indexes of anemia and prevalence of overall
anemia and macrocytosis was evaluated by comparing data from
before with data after folic acid fortification began in US adults.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Survey description and design
Thedatausedinthisreportwerederivedfrompubliclyavailable
databases released by the National Technical Information Service,
Springfield, VA. NHANES is based on a complex, stratified,
multistage probability sample survey design. Demographic, so-
cioeconomic, dietary, and health-related data were collected in the
participants' home as part of a household interview. Health ex-
amination was administered by a physician on all persons in the
household interviewed in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs).
Some received health examinations in their homes because they
were unable to come to the MECs. Certain individuals, such as
young children, older persons, and non-Hispanic black (NHB) and
Mexican American/Hispanic (MA/H) participants were over-
sampled to yield reliable estimates for these groups.
In this study, we used data from 4 surveys: NHANES 1988­
1994 (14­16), NHANES 1999­2000 (17), NHANES 2001­2002
(18), and NHANES 2003­2004 (19). The detailed description of
the survey methodologies and analytic guidelines was reported
previously (20, 21). Briefly, of 36,995 persons surveyed in
NHANES III, 33,994 were interviewed in their homes; 30,818
were examined in MECs; and 493 were examined in the home.
NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 were con-
ducted as continuous, annual surveys rather than as periodic
surveys. NHANES 1999­2000 was conducted between March
1999 and December 2000 in 9965 individuals (all were home-
interviewed; 9282 were examined in MECs); NHANES 2001­
2002 was conducted between January 2001 and December 2002
in 11,039 individuals (all were home-interviewed; 10,477 were
examined in MECs); and NHANES 2003­2004 was conducted
between January 2003 and December 2004 in 12,761 individuals
(10,122 were home-interviewed; 9643 were examined in MECs).
The survey response rates for NHANES 1988­1994 were 84% for
the household-interview component and 78% for the examination
component; whereas, the survey response rates for NHANES
1999­2000, NHANES 2001­2002, and NHANES 2003­2004
were 76%, 80%, and 76%, respectively.
Study sample
From the analysis, missing values for sex, race-ethnicity, age,
poverty:income ratio, vitamin/mineral supplement use, hemo-
globin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were
excluded. Additionally, individuals who reported their race-
ethnicity as ``unknown'' or other than non-Hispanic white (NHW),
NHB, or MA/H were excluded because of a small sample size.
After the above criteria were applied, the final study sample
consisted of 26,596 individuals (men ¼ 12,671; women ¼ 13,926).
For the purpose of data analysis, age was classified into 3 cate-
gories, ie, 19­40, 41­60, and .60. Poverty:income ratio was used
to define the socioeconomic status. Poverty:income ratio is the
ratio of the family's income to the family's appropriate threshold
income. A poverty:income ratio of ,1.0 was considered an
income below poverty level (22). The poverty:income ratio was
divided into low (,1.0), medium (1.0 to ,3.5), and high (!3.5)
categories. Individuals who took vitamin/mineral supplements
1 mo before the survey were categorized as supplement users.
Dietary intake assessment
In NHANES, nutrient intakes were calculated from 24-h di-
etary recalls, which were collected by using an automated,
microcomputer-based dietary interview and coding system known
as Dietary Data Collection. Participants reported all foods and
beverages consumed, except plain water, for the previous 24-h time
period (2400­2400). The nutrient composition of foods reported
in food recalls was based on the US Department of Agricul-
ture Survey Nutrient Databases (23). A number of quality-control
measures were used to ensure the accuracy of food recalls. A
detailed description of dietary intake methodology was published
elsewhere (20). For this study, the intakes of folate, iron, vitamin
B-6, and vitamin B-12 for NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES
1999­2004 were determined because these nutrients are known to
cure anemia.
Blood measurements and assessment of anemia
Blood was collected by venipuncture in the MECs according to
standard protocols. Whole blood was collected into EDTA-treated
tubesforacompletebloodcountanalysis.Aquantitative,automated
hematology analyzer was used to measure hemoglobin, hematocrit,
andMCV(Coulter method).Thedetaileddescriptiononspecimen
processing and laboratory methods was described elsewhere (24,
25). Anemia was defined as having hemoglobin concentrations
,13 g/dL for men and ,12 g/dL for women according to the
World Health Organization criteria (26), and macrocytosis was
defined as having MCV values .98 fL for both men and women.
Statistical analysis
SUDAAN statistical software Windows (version 8.0.2; Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used
to account for complex survey design. Sample weights, primary
sampling units, and stratification variables were considered in the
data analysis so that the differential probabilities of selection
and adjustments for noncoverage and nonresponse bias were
accounted for. We also used SAS for Windows (version 8.0; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) in conjunction with SUDAAN to manage
and analyze the data files.
In the data analysis, final examined sample weights were used
per NHANES guidelines (21). For the purpose of comparing data
from before to after folic acid fortification, we concatenated
NHANES 1999­2000, NHANES 2001­2002, and NHANES
2003­2004 data into one analytic data set, NHANES 1999­
2004, according to the NHANES guidelines (20). SEMs and
percentages were estimated with the Taylor Series Linearization
method. This method incorporates sample weights and accounts
for the complex survey design.

For NHANES 1988­1994 and 1999­2004, multivariate-
adjusted and univariate values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and
MCV and prevalence rates (%) for overall anemia and macro-
cytosis were determined according to sex, race-ethnicity (NHW,
NHB, and MA/H), age (19­40, 41­60, and .60 y), pover-
ty:income ratio (low, ,1.0; medium, 1.0 to ,3.5; and high,
!3.5), and vitamin/mineral supplement use (yes or no). Preva-
lence of anemia (%) based on low hemoglobin concentrations and
prevalence of macrocytosis (%) based on high MCV values were
determined for the aforementioned demographic categories. The
differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and prevalence of
anemia and macrocytosis between NHANES 1988­1994 and
NHANES 1999­2004 were determined with a 2-tailed unpaired
t test. The multivariate-adjusted dietary intakes of folate, iron,
vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 between NHANES 1988­1994
and NHANES 1999­2004 were also compared with a 2-tailed
unpaired t test. Indexes of anemia and macrocytosis are pre-
sented as means 6 SEMs, and prevalence rates for anemia and
macrocytosis are presented as percentages and SEs of the per-
centages by sex, race-ethnicity, age, poverty:income ratio, and
vitamin/mineral supplement use.
The likelihood of having anemia and macrocytosis in the
period after folic acid fortification began relative to that before
folic acid fortification began was determined with logistic re-
gression after the adjustment for race-ethnicity, age, pover-
ty:income ratio, and vitamin/supplement use in men and women.
Additionally, for both sexes, the likelihood of vitamin/mineral
supplement use in the period after folic acid fortification began
relative to that before folic acid fortification began was de-
termined with logistic regression after adjustment for sex, race-
ethnicity, age, and poverty:income ratio. In all analyses, a P ,
0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV
Sample sizes for indexes of anemia and prevalence of overall
anemia and macrocytosis for NHANES 1988­2004 are presented
in Table 1. Hemoglobin and MCV values by sex, race-ethnicity,
age, poverty:income ratio, and vitamin/mineral supplement use
for US adults aged !19 y in NHANESs 1988­1994 and 1999­
2004 are presented in Table 2. In men, adjusted mean hemo-
globin concentrations significantly increased from 15.1 g/dL in
1988­1994 to 15.4 g/dL in 1999­2004 (P , 0.0001), although the
increase was modest ('2%). In women, the increase was from
13.3 to 13.6 g/dL ('2.3%) from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004 (P ,
0.0001). Similar trends were observed in all demographic cate-
gories of the US population. In both sexes, from 1988­1994 to
1999­2004, a significant increase in hemoglobin concentrations
was observed in vitamin/mineral supplement users (a '1.3%
increase, P , 0.001 for men; a '3.0% increase, P , 0.0001 for
women) and nonusers (a '2.6% increase, P , 0.0001 for men;
a '2.3% increase, P ¼ 0.0001 for women). Trends observed in
hematocrit values by and large were similar to the trends that
were observed with hemoglobin (data not shown).
In men, adjusted mean MCV values slightly but significantly
increased from 1988­1994 (a '1% increase) to 1999­2004 (P ,
0.0123). When the data were stratified further, a significant in-
crease in MCV values from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004 was ob-
served in NHW men (P , 0.0021), in NHB men (P , 0.0348),
in men aged 19­40 y (P , 0.0174), in men aged .60 y (P ,
0.0105), in men in low (P , 0.0036) and medium (P , 0.0014)
poverty:income ratio groups, and in supplement users (P ,
0.0011). In women, MCV values did not change from 1988­
1994 to 1999­2004 in all demographic categories, except those
in the age group .60 y ('1.2% increase; P , 0.0141).
Prevalence of anemia and macrocytosis
The prevalence of anemia and macrocytosis (%) by sex, race-
ethnicity, age, poverty:income ratio, and vitamin/mineral sup-
plement use for US adults aged !19 y in NHANES 1988­1994
and 1999­2004 are presented in Table 3. The prevalence of
anemia in men did not change from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004,
except in men in the lowest poverty:income ratio group (5.4­
2.6%, a '51.9% reduction; P , 0.0038) and in men who took
no vitamin/mineral supplements (3.1­2.1%, a '32.3% re-
duction; P , 0.0177). On the other hand, in women, the
prevalence of anemia was significantly lower in 1999­2004
(7.5%) than in 1988­1994 (10.4%) (P , 0.0005). This amounts
to an overall decrease of !27.9% in the prevalence rate. From
1988­1994 to 1999­2004, the reduction in prevalence of anemia
was significant in NHW (7.7­4.6%, a '40.3% reduction; P ,
0.0005), in NHB (28.2­23.7%, a '16% reduction; P , 0.0018),
in MA/H (13.9­10.1%, a '27.3% reduction; P , 0.0178), and in
the 19­40-y-old age group (12.2­8.2%, a '32.8% reduction;
P , 0.0002). From 1988­1994 to 1999­2004, in women, the
prevalence of anemia decreased significantly in the lowest po-
verty:income ratio group (a '19.3% reduction; P , 0.041). In
those women who took vitamin/mineral supplements and who
did not take supplements, the prevalence of anemia was reduced
by '27% (P , 0.0122) and by '28.4% (P , 0.0039), re-
spectively, from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004. The prevalence of
macrocytosis did not change from the prefortifcation period
(1988-1994) to the postfortification period (1999-2004) in both
men (4.0­4.3%; P , 0.588) and women (4.0­4.0%; P , 0.9883).
Likelihood of having anemia and macrocytosis
The likelihood of having anemia and macrocytosis in the post-
fortification period relative to the prefortification period is presented
in Table 4. In men, the odds of having anemia in the post-
fortification period relative to the prefortification period was mar-
ginally significant (P , 0.0433). In women, the odds of having
anemia was significantly lower in the postfortification period than
in the prefortification period [multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR):
0.64; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.75; P , 0.0001]. However, the likelihood of
having macrocytosis in the postfortification relative to the pre-
fortification period was not significant in either sex.
Intakes of folate, iron, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 and
vitamin/mineral supplement use
For the pre- and postfortification periods, adjusted intakes of
folic acid, iron, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 and adjusted ORs
and 95% CIs for use of vitamin/mineral supplements for the
postfortification period relative to the prefortification period are
presented in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. Adjusted total
folate intake was significantly higher in NHANES 1999­2004
than in NHANES 1988­1994 (P , 0.0001). However, there was
no significant difference in intakes of iron, vitamin B-6, and

The likelihood of vitamin/mineral supplement use was signifi-
cantly higher in NHANES 1999­2004 than in NHANES 1988­
1994 (multivariate-adjusted OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.43, 1.77; P ,
0.0001).
DISCUSSION
In this report, we present the first data on indicators and preva-
lenceofanemiaandmacrocytosisusingdatafromNHANES1988­
1994 and 1999­2004 with a focus on comparing data from before
with that after folic acid fortification began. We found that he-
moglobinandhematocritvaluesweresignificantlyhigher('2­3%)

observedinwomenofalmostalldemographiccategoriesexamined.
The decrease in the prevalence of anemia from before to after folic
acid fortification ranged from 16% to 52%. On the other hand, the
prevalence of macrocytosis by and large remained the same in the
postfortification period as in the prefortification period.
Folic acid fortification has significantly increased serum folate
and red blood cell folate in the United States (7­11). We reported
previously that the prevalence of low serum folate decreased
from 18.4% in the prefortification period to 0.8% in the post-
fortification period (7). This decrease is due to increased folic

acid intake from fortified cereals (3, 4) and supplements (27)
after folic acid fortification. Given the remarkable improvement
in folate status after folic acid fortification, one would expect the
prevalence of macrocytosis to be lower in the postfortification
period than in the prefortification period because folic acid cures
folate deficiency­induced macrocytosis. Folate deficiency­induced
macrocytosis is not common in the United States. The preva-
lence of macrocytosis from folate deficiency accounts for 3% of
all macrocytosis cases (28). The majority of the macrocytosis
cases are related to drug treatment (methotrexate, mercaptopu-
rine, 5-fluouracil, zidovudine, metformin, trimethoprim, sulfa-
methoxazole, valproic acid, etc), alcoholism, reticulocytosis,
alcoholic andnonalcoholic liverdisease, hypothyroidism,multiple
myeloma, aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and vitamin B-12 de-
ficiency(29,30).Thus,mandatedfolicacidfortificationisunlikely
to have a significant impact on the prevalence of macrocytosis.
What is remarkable is the 16­52% decrease we observed in the
prevalence of overall anemia from the pre- to the postfortification
period. The decreased prevalence of anemia was mostly observed
in women. Additionally, in women, the odds of having anemia in
the postfortification period decreased by 36% relative to the
prefortification period (P , 0.0001). Improved indexes of ane-
mia and decreased prevalence of overall anemia in women could
partly be attributed to improved folate status due to increased

ysis on this sample showed that the adjusted folic acid intake
increased by '105 lg dietary folate equivalents from 1988­1994
to 1999­2004. Another explanation might be the improvement in
nutritional status of several nutrients that cure anemia because of
increased consumption of vitamin/mineral supplements in the
postfortification period than in the prefortification period. In this
study population, we showed that the likelihood of use of vitamin/
mineral supplements in the postfortification period increased by
59% (Table 6). Recently, Rock (31) reported that dietary
supplement use was 40% in the prefortification period (NHANES
1988­1994) and 52% in the postfortification period (NHANES
1999­2000). This level of supplement use was more frequent in
women than in men (32). Hence, a greater decrease in the

prevalence of anemia in women than in men was expected. In men,
a slight and significant increase in hemoglobin from the pre- to the
postfortification period translated into a marginally significant
reduction in the prevalence of anemia (OR: 0.79; P , 0.0433),
which suggests that most cases of anemia in men are of non-
nutritional origin. Men in low socioeconomic strata and men who
did not consume supplements experienced a significant reduction
in the prevalence of anemia from the pre- to the postfortification
period (Table 3). In these specific men, as in women, it is possible
that the removal of folate deficiency is likely the explanation for
the lower prevalence of anemia in the postfortification period.
Because folic acid cures folate deficiency­induced macrocy-
tosis, one would expect lower concentrations of MCV in the
postfortification period than in the prefortification period. How-
ever, we found no such decrease in MCV in women. On the other
hand, in men, there was a significant increase in MCV, albeit
slight. However, this increase in MCV in men did not result in the
increased prevalence of macrocytosis, which suggests that the
changes in MCV might have occurred within the normal range in
most men (,98 fL).
The observation of increased MCV in the postfortification
period, especially in men and in older persons, is at odds with our
earlier observation of lower MCVs in the postfortification period
than in the prefortification period in patients who received health
care in an urban institution (33). Difference in results between
this current study and our earlier study can be attributed to the
differences in characteristics of subjects. In support of our cur-
rent study findings, Hirsch et al (34) found an increase in MCV
in older Chilean people from the pre- to the postfortification
period. They concluded that increased MCV in the postforti-
fication period may be due to continued vitamin B-12 deficiency.
Recently, Morris et al (35), using NHANES data, found that
a high folate status was directly associated with anemia and
cognitive impairment in older subjects with a low vitamin B-12
status. We previously reported that the proportion of individuals
with low serum vitamin B-12 without macrocytosis was sig-
nificantly higher in the postfortification period than in the pre-
fortification period, which suggests a possible masking (delay in
diagnosis due to lack of anemia) of vitamin B-12 deficiency
(35). However, Mills et al (36) found no masking of vitamin
B-12 deficiency in patients who received care in a Veterans
Affairs hospital. More recently, Selhub et al (37) provided
a possible biochemical explanation for the exacerbation of clini-
cal manifestations of vitamin B-12 deficiency after high folic
acid intakes. Oakley (38), in his editorial, called for

cofortification of fortified cereals with vitamin B-12 to achieve
a daily intake of 6 lg/d to prevent or correct vitamin B-12 in-
sufficiency. However, we cannot ascertain whether the increased
MCV in men and in older persons was due to an exacerbation of
hematologic symptoms associated with vitamin B-12 in-
sufficiency because of the cross-sectional nature of the study.
Nonetheless, the cause of increased MCV in nontarget pop-
ulations, such as men in general and in older persons specifi-
cally, warrants future study.
It is possible that differences in methods used to measure in-
dexes of anemia may account for some of the differences we
observed between pre- and postfortification periods. This is un-
likely, however, because the methods used to measure indexes of
anemia were largely consistent between fortification periods. It is
important to note that each fortification period contained different
subjects with possibly different dietary behaviors. Dietary intakes
collected with the use of 24-h recalls are prone to measurement
error because of the participant's inability to recall the foods eaten
accurately. Because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, the
measurement of cause and effect was not possible.
Because NHANES 1988­1994 was conducted before folic acid
fortification was initiated and NHANES 1999­2004 was conducted
after folic acid fortification was initiated, the changes we observed
in indexes of anemia and in the prevalence of anemia may be
attributable to the mandated folic acid fortification and increased
use of vitamin/mineral supplements, although other potential un-
known confounding factors cannot be ruled out. Folic acid forti-
fication not only reduced the prevalence of NTDs as documented
previously (6), but it also indirectly improved indicators of anemia,
which led a significant reduction in the prevalence of anemia in
target population (an unintended benefit), which suggests much
wider public health implications than just NTDs. Because un-
metabolized folic acid has been found in the circulation at a dose
of 400 lg (39), folic acid status and its effects in both target and
nontarget populations should be monitored on a regular basis.
Although the prevalence of anemia was found to be significantly
lower after the initiation than before the initiation of folic acid
fortification, anemia continues to be a public health problem in
women, specifically in NHB and MA/H, and in those with in-
comes below the poverty level.

vey was conducted.
3 NHANES 1988­1994 was conducted before folic acid fortification
began.
4 NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 were conducted
after folic acid fortification began. NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and
2003­2004 were combined into one analytic data set, 1999­2004.
5 Significance of the likelihood of vitamin/mineral supplement use be-
fore fortification began (NHANES 1988­1994) relative to that after fortifi-
cation began (NHANES 1999­2004) in the multivariate-logistic regression
analysis.
