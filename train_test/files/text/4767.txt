Introduction
In recent years, Western Australia has experienced signifi-
cant population growth, with overseas migrants accounting
for over half of the state's net migration in the 5 years to
2010, the highest in Australia, and approximately 5% of
these arrived on humanitarian visas (refugees). In the Perth
metropolitan area, almost 29% of residents migrated from
another country between 2006 and 2011 (Australian
Government, 2012). One non-government agency in Western
Australia that works with migrant and refugee women is
Women's Health and Family Services (WHFS). WHFS pro-
vides medical services, counseling, information, community
talks and workshops, advocacy, referral, and outreach to
women from over 80 different ethnic groups. WHFS also has
a women's Alcohol and other Drug (AOD) service to meet
the needs of women who are using AOD, as well as provid-
ing services to support their families. Although migrant and
refugee women access a wide range of WHFS programs, at
the time of this study few culturally and linguistically diverse
(CALD) women attended the AOD service. To explore the
reasons for this, a needs assessment was undertaken to better
understand the barriers that prevented women from access-
ing AOD services and to explore the types of services and
programs desired by newly arrived women, the findings of
which are reported elsewhere (Lee, Sulaiman-Hill, &
Thompson, 2013). This article reports on information col-
lected as part of the larger study regarding women's own
AOD use and issues related to the impact of AOD use by
others on these women. This information was used by WHFS
to help design better services for CALD women experienc-
ing AOD issues.
Background
AOD use, for both men and women, are influenced by a
number of environmental factors. These can include physical
access, socio-demographic characteristics such as occupa-
tion, family-related factors, peer group and cultural norms,
motivation, attitudes and expectations for drug use, as well
as physical health, and the impact of life events such as trau-
matic experiences (Jonas, Dobson, & Brown, 2000; Marsh,
Towers, & O'Toole, 2012). However, a number of gender
differences have been reported particularly with respect to
mental health issues associated with problematic alcohol use.
Women who use alcohol hazardously are more likely to
experience depression and anxiety compared with men,
while alcohol-related suicide attempts and fatalities are also

Alcohol Experiences and Concerns of
Newly Arrived Migrant Women

Abstract
Migrant women are under-represented as users of alcohol and other drug (AOD) services. This study examined AOD use by
newly arrived women, identifying issues of concern to them. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with 268 migrant
women who had arrived in Perth, Western Australia, within the previous 5 years. Almost half were humanitarian entrants.
Most women (76%) reported they did not drink alcohol. Of those who did, 10 were drinking at harmful levels and over
half reported changes to their drinking patterns since arrival. One fifth of participants (20%) described distressing incidents
related to alcohol or drug use by others. Migrant women are concerned by alcoholand drug-related problems, even if they
do not drink themselves. Domestic violence and abuse by strangers were concerns that were aggravated by alcohol and drug
use. As new migrants often lack strategies to prevent, or deal with alcohol-related misuse, provision of additional information
and support is recommended.

more prevalent among women (Dale & Marsh, 2000; Marsh
et al., 2012).
In addition, because of the health consequences of mater-
nal drug use, stigmatization of pregnant women as a result of
any type of drug use may occur. Even for women who are not
pregnant, their role as mothers and caregivers can mean that
women who drink or use drugs experience more shame,
guilt, and stigma than men. The barriers of stigma, depres-
sion, and fear of removal of children in a woman's care, can
result in their reluctance to seek help; consequently women
enter treatment programs at half the rate that men do (Dale &
Marsh, 2000; National Centre for Education Training on
Addiction [NCETA] Consortium, 2004).
Historically, AOD service delivery in Western countries
was largely developed on the basis of research with Caucasian
males (Sterk, 1999; Whiteside-Mansell, Crone, & Conners,
1999). As the original model of service delivery has often
been applied with little specific research, consultation, or
adaptation to reflect the particular needs of other popula-
tions, services are not necessarily entirely appropriate for
women and/or other ethnic populations (Sterk, 1999;
Whiteside-Mansell et al., 1999).
Women, Drug Use, and the Influence
of Culture
Although statistics (Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, 2012) show that migrant and refugee women are
under-represented among users of AOD treatment services
(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North
Richmond Community Health Centre, 2000), this is not nec-
essarily an indication that the use of AOD among this group
of women should be of less concern (De Jong, Valentine, &
Kennedy, 1998; Straussner, 2001). Low rates of access to
AOD services by CALD women may have more to do with
language difficulties, lack of awareness of services, stigma
attached to drug use, and cultural issues regarding discussing
private issues with "outsiders," than with lack of need
(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North
Richmond Community Health Centre, 2000; Ng, Bartu, &
Sang, 1999; Working Women's Health & Women's Health in
the North, 2000). Research conducted with such groups
needs to take into consideration the heterogeneity of cultural
groups and the interaction of a range of personal and group
factors, which can impact on personal and family AOD con-
sumption patterns (Ames & Rebhun, 1996). Although there
has been Australian research on migrant and refugee groups
and their issues and concerns regarding alcohol use
(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North
Richmond Community Health Centre, 2000; Ng et al., 1999;
Working Women's Health & Women's Health in the North,
2000), this area of research remains underexplored. Similarly,
research on gender differences with relation to AOD use are
uncommon, especially in Australia, and specific studies
reporting on issues for CALD women are rare (Working
Women's Health & Women's Health in the North, 2000).
Existing studies illustrate a complex interaction of gen-
der, culture, and attitudes toward drug use (Chen et al.,
2000; Reid, Crofts, & Beyer, 2001; Rissel, McLellan,
Bauman, & Tang, 2001; Sargent, Maher, Higgs, & Crofts,
2001). Some interactions are protective, especially for
women, with strong ethno-cultural, parental, and religious
proscriptions against the use of illegal and even legal drugs
such as alcohol, in some cases. However, with accultura-
tion, women's drug use patterns more closely approximate
mainstream patterns of consumption (Ames & Rebhun,
1996), but the impact of acculturation on drug use is rarely
measured in AOD studies with participants from CALD
backgrounds as there is considerable debate as to what con-
stitutes a valid measure of acculturation (Alegria, 2009;
Thomson & Hoffman-Goetz, 2009a, 2009b). Individual
users, their families, and the community groups to which
they belong may demonstrate a wide range of reactions to
women's drug use. Such responses can include shame, loss
of face, denial, stigma, embarrassment, and even a per-
ceived loss of honor (Bradby & Williams, 2006; Roarty &
Saggers, 2009) and these may place drug users at even
greater risk by introducing significant cultural barriers
around accessing services.
Method
Other projects involving consumer participation with ethnic
communities have found a reference group useful as a forum
for discussion, debate, decision making, and action
(Karantzas-Savva & Kirwan, 2004). Therefore, as part of
this study, a Consumer Reference Group was established to
guide the project and to help better understand the barriers to
service access (Lee, Thompson, & Amorin-Woods, 2009).
Women were invited to participate based upon their capabil-
ity and interest, rather than as an appointed representative of
an association or an ethnic group, with the focus being on
gaining consumer perspectives from a wide range of women.
The group consisted of women from multicultural back-
grounds who were interested in AOD issues as well as gen-
eral women's health concerns and they volunteered their
time to meet regularly with staff facilitators. The purpose of
the group was to assist WHFS examine the appropriateness
of WHFS AOD services for CALD women, and plan educa-
tion and prevention programs for migrant and refugee women
and their families around smoking, alcohol, medication, and
other drug issues.
The consumer reference group provided background
information about the communities under study, as well as
providing a forum to facilitate discussion of issues arising
during the study and for validation of key research findings.
Interviews with service providers from government and non-
governmental agencies who worked extensively with newly
arrived migrant and refugee women, as well as a number of
focus group meetings and interviews with migrant women
helped to guide development of the survey protocol and
questionnaire format.
Lee et al. 3
For the quantitative survey, 268 migrant and refugee
women were recruited between October and December 2006.
Women aged 18 years or older, who had arrived in Perth
within the previous 5 years, were invited to participate. A
purposive snowball sampling technique was adopted to
recruit participants, using multiple starting points to limit
bias. The heterogeneity in snowball samples can be improved
by choosing a broad range of snowball initiation points and
limiting each chain to a small number of links (Atkinson &
Flint, 2001; Bloch, 2007; Sulaiman-Hill & Thompson, 2011),
so respondents were recruited through English classes, com-
munity organizations, workplaces, community-based clubs,
and groups run through WHFS.
The survey was administered using face-to-face inter-
views, and women with limited English language skills were
interviewed using bilingual workers or through interpreters.
Six participants chose to self-administer the survey to com-
plete it. The questionnaire was not translated from English,
as more than 40 different language groups were represented
among the women interviewed and translation costs would
have been prohibitive. Extensive piloting of the question-
naire ensured that the wording used in the questionnaire was
understood by a broad range of women from a variety of
cultural and educational backgrounds, either in English or
with the help of an interpreter or bilingual worker.
In addition to a range of demographic variables, questions
were included which focused on smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, alcohol-related verbal and physical abuse, access to
medical and social services, herbal and prescription medica-
tion, and illegal drugs. There was a filter question regarding
alcohol so women who drank less than one standard drink of
alcohol in a month did not answer the alcohol-related ques-
tions. Risk of harm from drinking was ascertained by asking
participants who did drink, "Since coming to Australia, on
average how often do you have an alcoholic drink of any
kind?" Response choices were as follows: every day, 5 to 6
days a week, 3 to 4 days a week, 1 to 2 days a week, less
often, and no answer. These questions were based on those
used in the National Drug Household Survey (The Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, 2005), to allow comparison
with Australian population data. Consumption patterns were
then explored by asking "On a day that you have an alcoholic
drink, how many standard drinks do you usually have?"
Participants could refer to a pictorial guide as to what a stan-
dard drink looked like to assist them in answering the ques-
tion based on the Australian Alcohol Guidelines current at
the time (National Health and Medical Research Council,
2001).
Questions related to barriers to accessing services, the
type of information women would like and the types of ser-
vices and programs they would find helpful were also
included based on previous focus group feedback. Although
the majority of survey questions were in multiple choice or
short answer format, one section used index cards with pic-
tures to depict the types of services and information that
women were interested in. Women were asked to select and
rank their topics of most importance (Bauer, 1995), a process
they described as "voting" for the various options, a tech-
nique that proved to be an effective and enjoyable method of
communicating ideas to women from a wide range of cul-
tural and socio-economic backgrounds.
Analysis of quantitative survey data was performed using
SPSS statistical software. Descriptive and frequency distri-
butions were calculated for each variable, with cross-tabula-
tions (2) providing a summary of relationships between
categorical variables.
The project received ethics approval from the Human
Research Ethics Committee at Curtin University.
Results
The age, time in Australia and visa categories of the 268
women survey respondents is described in Table 1. Women
were born in 50 different countries and spoke 48 different
primary languages. Just under half (43%) were humanitarian
arrivals (refugees).
The majority (76.1%; n = 201) of women reported that
they had not drunk more than one standard drink of alcohol
per month during the previous 12 months. Following further
questions, three women described alcohol use other than that
reported in the original filter question based on a standard
drink diagram, "In the last 12 months have you drunk more

than one standard drink of alcohol in any one month?" (Yes,
[choices provided], No, or Refused). In total, 65 women
reported drinking some alcohol.
Harmful Drinking Patterns
Three women were assessed as drinking at risky levels for
short-term harm (5-6 standard drinks on 1-2 days a week),
and one woman was at high risk for short-term harm (7-10
standard drinks on 3-4 days per week) based on theAustralian
Alcohol Guidelines current at the time (National Health and
Medical Research Council, 2001).
Seven women were drinking at levels consistent with risk
for long-term harm. Five women reported drinking 3 to 4
standard drinks 3 to 4 days a week, one woman was drinking
3 to 4 standard drinks every day, and one woman drank 7 to
10 standard drinks 3 to 4 days each week. Five of these
women reported drinking more alcohol since coming to
Australia. Six requested information and support for depres-
sion, and five wanted information and support around family
violence.
Changes in Drinking Habits
For those who drank alcohol, changes in alcohol use were
also explored. Women were asked to compare their current
drinking habits with their drinking habits in their home coun-
try. Participants were asked, "Compared to when you drank
alcohol in your own country, since coming to Australia are
you drinking: about the same amount of alcohol, drinking
less alcohol, drinking more alcohol or refused." Participants
were asked about possible reasons for any changes in their
drinking patterns. Of those drinking alcohol, 38.3% (n = 23)
reported drinking about the same amount, 28.3% (n = 17)
reported drinking less, and 31.7% (n = 19) described
increased alcohol consumption. Reasons for drinking more
alcohol included alcohol being cheaper than back home,
socializing with Australians who drank alcohol, and as a way
of coping with stress. Health concerns, wishing to be a good
role model for their children and having fewer occasions to
socialize since arrival were reasons given for drinking less.
Alcohol Use by Others
All women were asked if,
Since coming to Australia, has anyone who has been drinking
alcohol or taking drugs ever: Verbally abused you (insulted you,
yelled or sworn at you); Physically abused you (hit you, pushed
you); Put you in fear (made you scared); Made you feel
uncomfortable; or Made you have sex when you didn't want to?
Her relationship to that person was also assessed. These
results are described in Table 2.
Survey data were then compared with findings from the
most recent National Drug Strategy Household Survey at the
time (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2005).
Although the phrasing of some questions was slightly differ-
ent, making direct comparison difficult, some general obser-
vations were noted. CALD women surveyed in this project
were significantly less likely to report verbal abuse than
women in the National Drug Survey, but were significantly
more likely to have felt fearful. In the study group, there was
no significant difference between refugee and non-refugee
new arrivals regarding verbal abuse experienced by strang-
ers; however, migrant women were more likely to experience
being put in fear by a stranger than refugee women (2 =
5.444, df = 1, p = .020). Migrant women were also more
likely to have felt uncomfortable or embarrassed by someone
who had been drinking alcohol or taking drugs (2 = 9.99, df
= 2, p = .007) and more likely to report having been made to
have sex when they didn't want to by someone who had been
drinking alcohol or taking drugs (2 = 5.850, df = 2, p = .054).
Strangers accounted for the overwhelming majority of cases
where women were verbally abused, fearful, or embarrassed,
while partners were more likely to be the people who physi-
cally abused them.
Incidents by a Stranger
The 46 women who had experienced one or more incidents
by a stranger of verbal abuse, physical abuse, being put in
fear or forced to have sex when they didn't want to, were
from 19 different countries. They had a range of English lan-
guage abilities, religious affiliations and migration visa cat-
egories. Women in their twenties and thirties were
significantly more likely to have experienced these incidents
by strangers (2 = 12.478; df = 4; p = .014).
Participants were asked if they had been drinking and/or
taking drugs at the time of any of these incidents. Of the 80
women who answered the question, 15 women (18.8%)
reported that they had been drinking alcohol when the inci-
dent took place.
Incidents by a Partner
Current or ex-intimate partners also accounted for a substan-
tial number of incidents, with 20 women reporting concerns
Lee et al. 5
in this area. These women were aged 21 to 48 years, were
from 13 different countries with varying English language
abilities and religious beliefs. More women entering
Australia under spousal or fiancé visas experienced these
incidents (n = 9) but there was no significant difference
between the different migration categories. Eight women
(42.1%) reported drinking alcohol before the incident(s) took
place.
Family Drinking Concerns
As one of the larger study aims was to explore topics of con-
cern to migrant women, all 268 survey participants were
asked to rank their priority issues and concerns. Responses
included requests for information on illegal drugs, and for
families affected by family violence and alcohol abuse.
These results are presented in Table 3.
Of 40 women (14.9%) who requested support for family
members drinking too much alcohol in their top five choices,
six ranked this as their first or second priority. Among par-
ticipants, there were indications of intimate partner vio-
lence--verbal abuse by their current partner (mentioned by
5), physical abuse by their partner (3), put in fear by their
partner (5), and being forced to have sex when they didn't
want to (5), for whom two reported this as being by a former
partner).
Seven women, from a range of demographic backgrounds,
reported concerns or arguments with family or friends about
a family member or friend's alcohol and drug use. Two of the
women who wanted support for a family member were
drinking at levels considered risky or at high risk for long-
term health consequences themselves.
Discussion
The majority of women in our survey (76%) did not drink
alcohol. Other studies of migrant alcohol use have also
reported abstinence or low drinking levels among women
compared with the mainstream population and subsequent
generations (Ames & Rebhun, 1996; Bradby & Williams,
2006; Caetano, 1994; Gilbert, 1991).
However, our findings do suggest that some newly arrived
women may be acculturating to Australian alcohol use
patterns much more quickly than previously anticipated as a
result of prevailing host society attitudes. New arrivals to
any country come with their own traditions and values about
alcohol. Some beliefs and customs will be similar to those of
the host country, while others will be quite different and
necessitate ongoing negotiation of the host country's drink-
ing culture (Allan, Clifford, Ball, Alston, & Meister, 2012).
The adoption of behavior patterns, attitudes, beliefs, and cus-
toms of the host population by newcomers has been theo-
rized to take place over decades, or even generations
(Caetano, 1994; Gilbert, 1991). Even though the drinking
habits of the group remained the same or even decreased in
some cases, one third of participants reported drinking more
and this was primarily due to social interaction with
Australians, availability of alcohol, and related acculturative
pressures as highlighted elsewhere (Arfken, Arnetz,
Fakhouri, Ventimiglia, & Jamil, 2011; Szaflarski, Cubbins,
& Ying, 2011). However, unlike some countries, drinking is
seen as a positive or even essential social practice and an
integral component of Australian culture (Allan et al., 2012)
and there is considerable pressure for non-drinkers to con-
form. Several non-drinking women in the study encountered
pressure to drink, or drink more, due to these expectations.
The interaction between acculturation and drinking patterns
could be explored in future studies. Four women in the sur-
vey did report drinking more alcohol as a way of coping with
stress. Although an increase in alcohol use has been linked to
stressful conditions (Szaflarski et al., 2011) and trauma
(Arfken et al., 2011), in many situations this may be under-
reported or not publicly acknowledged. Although population
data and risk group behaviors are known in some cases, rela-
tively little information has been reported on new arrivals
and this is another area for future study.
Although for the majority of participants, their current
drinking levels posed no short- or long-term risk to health, a
small number of women were drinking at harmful levels.
While an increase in alcohol consumption and problematic
use by a few does not imply a serious problem for the group
overall, as the total alcohol consumption of a given popula-
tion increases, the risk for a concurrent increase in problem-
atic drinking will also increase (Ames & Rebhun, 1996).
Cultural and religious beliefs may offer some protection
against alcohol problems, but these factors do not provide
total protection against problematic alcohol use, as risk fac-
tors such as poverty, discrimination, targeted alcohol adver-
tising, and alcohol availability may prove more powerful
than such protective beliefs (Ames & Rebhun, 1996). High
drinking frequency has been associated with high host cul-
ture competence and social interaction in other studies
(Amundsen, 2012), so as new arrivals acculturate the risk of
alcohol-related issues is likely to increase over time. All new
CALD arrivals should therefore be provided with appropri-
ate information regarding alcohol consumption and how to
access information or services if needed. Forty women
(14.9%) requested support and information for family mem-
bers drinking too much alcohol as a priority topic. Although

a minority, the findings suggest these women may have
found it difficult to access services or get the information and
support they require.
Alcohol-Related Violence
The results of the survey confirmed the views of service pro-
viders and newly arrived women in the development phase
of the research that alcohol use by partners often played a
role in domestic violence, even though it was not the direct
cause of the violence (Lee, 2008). This also concurs with
previous reports (Leonard, 2001). Around 20% of question-
naire respondents reported incidents of either verbal abuse or
being put in fear by a family member drinking alcohol or
taking drugs since their arrival in Australia. Although inci-
dents of physical abuse (4.3%) and sexual assault (5.2%)
were less common, members of the project's Consumer
Reference Group felt that there may have been a tendency to
underreport such incidents, based on their own experiences
and anecdotal reports within their communities. While the
questionnaire gave examples of verbal abuse (being insulted,
yelled, or sworn at) and physical abuse (being hit or pushed),
cultural and individual differences in what is regarded as
abuse could potentially account for some discrepancies
(Allimant & Ostapiej-Piatkowski, 2011). The impact of
social desirability bias certainly needs to be considered when
discussing sensitive issues such as domestic violence.
Although the majority of surveys were completed by inter-
view, six respondents asked to self-complete the survey
form. During this process, several of these women disclosed
information about family violence and alcohol abuse by a
partner, details that may have been less forthcoming if dis-
cussed during interview.
Issues related to AOD use by others impacting on the
safety of ethnic women in public places are not often reported
in the literature, although twoAustralian projects with CALD
women in Victoria (Working Women's Health & Women's
Health in the North, 2000) and the Vietnamese community in
Perth (Ng et al., 1999) have reported findings consistent with
the present study. Just under half of our study participants
reported one or more abusive incidents by a stranger, often
citing traumatic events that may well have been reported to
the police by other people had they experienced the same
abuse. Refugee women did not experience more abuse, sex-
ual assault, or fear than other migrants, or in comparison
with women in the National Drug survey (Australian Institute
of Health and Welfare, 2005), although refugees have been
identified as a vulnerable subgroup for alcohol misuse
(Arfken et al., 2011). Given their often traumatic histories
and because they may lack strategies to deal with such inci-
dents in the early period after settlement, they are potentially
at higher risk for re-traumatization, posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), and other mental health problems (Sowey,
2005; Sulaiman-Hill & Thompson, 2012). Although it is pos-
sible that insults and abuse may sometimes go unheeded due
to language barriers, it is also likely that the problem may be
underreported due to a lack of trust in authorities or unfamil-
iarity of the system in Australia. Women described incidents
that impacted on their confidence and feelings of safety and
they appeared to lack strategies to deal with these either at
the time or afterward. Sometimes this is due to uncertainty
regarding what they should do or where to seek assistance,
revealing a need to discuss prevention strategies and provide
all new arrivals with the tools and knowledge to deal with
such incidents.
Limitations
The sample size of this study is relatively small (268 migrant
and refugee women) in comparison with population surveys
but these often fail to adequately identify and provide facili-
ties for collecting and reporting data for CALD women who
may have challenges with the English language.
Notwithstanding, the study provides evidence that alcohol-
related problems among newly arrived women may be of
greater concern than the literature suggests. More research in
this area is needed.
Although it was assumed that limiting the research to
women who had been in Australia 5 years or less would
reduce the effects of acculturation, an acculturation scale
could have clarified whether reported changes in behavior
were due to women acculturating faster than previously
assumed, or to other factors.
Another limitation of the study was that the question-
naires were not translated but instead administered by bilin-
gual/bicultural workers or by the principle researcher with
the assistance of an interpreter. It is possible that measure-
ment errors may have occurred during the data collection and
may have affected the findings, although supervision and
debriefing of interviewers occurred frequently during data
collection. While in a perfect research environment validated
translations would have been used, this was impractical for
logistical and financial reasons. Moreover, at the time of the
research there was a lack of accredited translators and inter-
preters for some of the languages spoken by participants. The
processes, advantages, and disadvantages of using bilingual
workers, interpreters, and translated instruments in this study
will be explored in detail elsewhere (article currently under
review).
Some notable differences were also observed between
self-reported and interviewer data, revealing the impact of
social desirability factors. It is likely that some sensitive
material around family violence and physical abuse may
have been withheld from interviewers due to embarrassment
or shame. Measurement limitations such as recall bias of pre-
migration drinking patterns combined with the transitional
nature of the migration process also need to be considered. In
addition, although participants had the opportunity to have
the questionnaire administered using an interpreter or bilin-
gual worker, the questionnaire format was in English. It is
Lee et al. 7
possible that inconsistencies in interpretation, especially for
women with little or no understanding of English, could have
impacted on some results. Using a validated, translated
instrument could have overcome some of these issues.
At the time of the study, WHFS was only funded for
women clients, so the focus of the research was AOD issues
specifically relating to women. The questionnaire did not
expressly investigate the drinking habits of partners or chil-
dren of the women respondents, or how these had changed
since coming to Australia and this would be an important
focus for future research.
Conclusion
Although cultural and religious imperatives underpin the
drinking habits of many migrant women resulting in low lev-
els of alcohol use or abstinence, this study has highlighted
the vicarious impact of alcohol use by others on newly
arrived women in Australia, an issue not well documented in
the literature. Concerns related to alcohol and drug use by
others include domestic violence and verbal and physical
abuse by strangers, which impact on CALD women's feel-
ings of safety in public places. Many migrant women lack
strategies to prevent or deal with the consequences of family
or stranger alcohol misuse, so health and settlement service
providers are encouraged to provide new arrivals with appro-
priate information and support.
