This paper analyzes the impact of market liberalization on gender earnings differentials
and discrimination against women in urban China at the beginning of the 1990s. The
observed stability in the overall gender earnings gap between 1988 and 1995 is shown to
result from a complex set of evolutions across enterprises, earnings distributions, and
time. Our results highlight the interplay of opposing forces, with economic reforms con-
tributing to changes in managers'behaviors in different dimensions. On the one hand, by
bringing more competition, liberalization favored a reduction in discriminating behaviors
in both urban collectives and foreign-invested enterprises; on the other hand, by relaxing
institutional rules, it led to a loosening of the government's egalitarian wage-setting
policies, leaving more space for discrimination in state-owned enterprises.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Chinese urban labor market has experienced tremendous structural changes
since 1978, which have been widely documented over the last 10 years. The
expected impact of these changes on the male/female earnings gap, however,
remains ambiguous. Indeed, from a theoretical point of view, as stressed by Liu,
Meng, and Zhang (2000), opposing forces may be at work. On the one side, the
Maoist egalitarian ideology aimed at reducing any type of discrimination: relaxing
the power of the State on wage-setting mechanisms may thus have brought back to the
surface some patriarchal Confucian forces, leading to an increase in the male/female
wage gap. On the other hand, increased competition induced by the reforms may

have encouraged profit-based behaviors. As a source of inefficiency, discrimination
mechanisms may thus have decreased.
From an empirical point of view, evidence of the impact of labor market reforms
on the male/female wage gap in urban China is also unclear. Relatively few studies
have addressed the issue and findings are very different.1 Liu, Meng, and Zhang
(2000) find larger gender wage differentials in the private sector than in both the state
and the collective sectors in two coastal cities (Jinan and Shanghai) in 1995. How-
ever, they show that the relative share of discrimination in the overall gender wage
gap substantially reduces across ownership from the State to the private sector. Their
interpretation is that market competition has actually lessened the importance of
discrimination in total wage differentials. Using 1991 data collected in 26 cities and
12 provinces, Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002) also find that the size of the
male/female wage gap tends to increase with the degree of market liberalization.
However, when taking into account differences in the wage structure, they show that
much of the larger gender wage gaps in the most liberalized sectors (joint venture
and collective) can be explained by a greater degree of wage dispersion. They con-
clude that their analysis provides "no empirical support to the hypothesis of reform-
induced increases in labor market discrimination against women" (p. 728).2 Using
data on Beijing and Guangdong in 1993, Qian (1996) finds different patterns, the
gender wage gap being the largest in the collective sector (14%) and the smallest in
the foreign sector (1%). Although not decomposing by ownership, Qian finds that
labor-market discrimination is responsible for more than half of the observed overall
gender wage gap in both Beijing and Guangdong. On the same data set as the one
used in this paper, Gustafsson and Li (2000) show that, although the male/female
wage gap still remains at a low level in urban China as compared to international
standards, it has been slightly increasing over the 1988­95 period. Like Maurer-Fazio
and Hughes (2002), they show that this modest increase in earnings differential is
driven by increased income inequality in urban China rather than by a deterioration
of the relative position of women in the earnings distribution. Using the same data
set, Bishop, Luo, and Wang (2005) employ quantile regressions to examine returns
to human capital characteristics at various quantiles in the earnings distribution.
They find that while the earnings gap has increased, the unexplained fraction of the
gap has declined over time, especially at the bottom of the income distribution.
1 We restrict it here to analyses on urban gender wage gaps only, although a large amount of literature
also deals with gender wage differentials in rural China. See Dong et al. (2004), Ho et al. (2002),
Meng (1998), Meng and Miller (1995), and Rozelle et al. (2002).
2 Using the same database, Hughes and Maurer-Fazio (2002) explore gender wage gaps for both
married and unmarried workers. They highlight less discrimination against single women in the
most liberalized sector (joint ventures), but the reverse for married women, for whom the
unexplained wage differential is the highest.

Lastly, using annual data from 1988 to 1999, Liu, Zhang, and Kung (2004) find a
slight increase in gender wage gaps over time, explained by the conjunction of
increasing rewards for observed and unobserved skills (inducing increased discrim-
ination) and converging skill levels between men and women. Using the same
national cross-section data from 1988 to 1997, Ng (2005) finds that discrimination
against women in urban China is higher in the most liberalized part of China (the
coastal region) and that this pattern becomes more pronounced over time.
Previous studies have followed two types of approach to address the gender wage
gap issue in urban China. The first approach consists of comparing different owner-
ship enterprises characterized by different levels of exposure to market forces (Qian
1996; Liu, Meng, and Zhang 2000; Maurer-Fazio and Hughes 2002; Hughes and
Maurer-Fazio 2002). The second approach consists of the comparison of discrimi-
nation levels observed at two or more points in time (Gustafsson and Li 2000; Liu,
Zhang, and Kung 2004; Bishop, Luo, and Wang 2005; Ng 2005). These approaches
being complementary, our paper tries to address jointly the question of the differ-
ences in the male/female earnings gap across ownership sectors and over time. On
the same data set, Gustafsson and Li (2000) have provided the baseline for the analysis
of the effects of economic reforms on the relative economic status of women. Our
paper adds to their analysis by including a subdivision of the sample by ownership,
which allows for further analyses of the impact of labor market liberalization on the
gender earnings gap. Moreover, our decompositions run from microsimulation at the
individual level, allowing us to analyze the discrimination issue along the income
distribution and to highlight nonuniform patterns in the evolution of discrimination.
China's transition towards a market economy has gradually promoted the develop-
ment of the non-state sector, composed of collective enterprises, private or individual
enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs). The different ownership
corresponds to different degrees of openness to market forces, leading to a strongly
segmented labor market structure (Dong and Bowles 2002; Zhao 2002; Chen,
Démurger, and Fournier 2005). Comparing discrimination levels between enter-
prises of different ownership and their evolution thus provides valuable information
on the specific impact of reforms increasing market competition.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the methodology. Section
III presents the data and provides descriptive statistics on gender wage differentials
by ownership and over time. Section IV discusses earnings functions estimations
and Section V presents decomposition results for the male/female earnings gap
across ownership sectors and over time. Section VI offers concluding remarks.
II. METHODOLOGY
In order to analyze male/female earnings gaps for different ownership enter-
prises, Oaxaca­Blinder decompositions (Blinder 1973; Oaxaca 1973) are run on

three dimensions: gender, enterprise ownership, and time. These decompositions
provide evaluations of the magnitude and the evolution of discrimination
phenomena.
A. Modeling Total Earnings
Let represent earnings for individual i belonging to gender s observed at date t.
depends on two sets of arguments: individual characteristics ( ) and a set of
parameters corresponding to the earnings model linking individual characteristics
with observed earnings ( ). The wage-generating process can thus be expressed as
a function, W, of these two sets of arguments:
(1)
B. Dynamic Decomposition
Using this general specification, decompositions can be applied in different
dimensions. For the sake of simplicity, the gender earnings gap is represented here
as the difference between average male earnings and average female earnings.3 First,
the observed evolution of the gender earnings gap between two dates (t and T) can
be decomposed as follows:4

with5

and
3 In the application that follows, male/female earnings gaps are measured as the difference between
average male earnings and average female earnings as a percentage of average female earnings.
4 The following procedure is very much in the line of extensions of Oaxaca­Blinder decompositions
to the time dimension initiated by Blau and Beller (1988), Smith and Welch (1989), and Wellington
(1993). We chose this approach over the one initiated by Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) because
our empirical findings show significant differences between men's and women's models concerning
returns to observed characteristics, which violates the core (implicit) assumption underlying the
procedure proposed by Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) (see Datta Gupta, Oaxaca, and Smith
2000).

The procedure proposed in equations (3) and (4) allows for a decomposition of
the observed change in the earnings gap into:
1. A pure effect of changes in discrimination, keeping population structures fixed
(that of date T in equation 3).
2. A pure effect of changes in characteristics, keeping remuneration structures fixed
(that of date t in equation 4).
C. Static Decompositions by Gender
The same type of decomposition procedure can be applied to the gender earnings
gap for any given year, t, as follows:
(5)
where
(6)
and
(7)
In the same line as for dynamic decomposition, this decomposition corresponds
to the evaluation of what would be the observed male/female earnings gap for year t
under the following conditions:
1. If men and women were sharing the same socio-demographic characteristics
(that of men in equation 6) D: pure discrimination effect.
2. If men and women were facing the same remuneration structure (that of women
in equation 7) E: pure difference-in-characteristics effect.
D. Implementation Issues
The practical implementation of the method consists of two phases. Earnings
equations are estimated by year, sex, and ownership. Estimated coefficients are then
used to run micro-simulations and evaluate average values for each of the effects
presented in subsections B and C.
A general issue concerning decompositions of the Oaxaca­Blinder type concerns path
dependency (Fournier 2005). Indeed, evaluated effects a priori depend on the bench-
mark population structure or coefficient vector chosen to run micro-simulations. In

the following, each possible evaluation is considered and minimum­maximum
intervals are reported, which can be considered as a robustness test.6
In order to analyze differences in discrimination across different ownership
structures, earning functions by ownership are estimated and used to run the
preceding decompositions by ownership as well as for the total. Doing so brings in
an additional dimension when comparing the results obtained for the total to the
results derived for different ownership: differences in the distribution of males
and females across different ownership enterprises. Analyzing thoroughly this
issue would require formal modeling and simulation of enterprise-type choices by
sex.7 This, however, goes far beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on
earnings discrimination within enterprise types. We chose here to stick to simple
re-weighting procedures to provide a preliminary assessment of the magnitude of
these phenomena.
III. GENDER EARNINGS GAP IN URBAN CHINA AND ITS
EVOLUTION FROM 1988 TO 1995
A. Data Sources
The data used in this paper come from two comparable urban household income
surveys from the China Household Income Project (CHIP)8 for 1988 and 1995. The
data cover 9,009 households and 31,827 individuals across 10 provinces in 1988 and
6,931 households and 21,694 individuals across 11 provinces in 1995.9 Contrary to
Gustafsson and Li (2000), who include owners and employees of private and indi-
vidual enterprises, we chose to restrict our analysis to wageworkers aged between
16 and 60 years, who declared working at least part of the year. Due to the lack
of reliable information on wages for private or individual enterprises, we further
restricted our sample to four categories of enterprise ownership: state-owned
enterprises at central or provincial level (CSOEs), local public-owned enterprises
(LSOEs), urban collective enterprises (UCEs), and FIEs.10 Enterprise ownership
6 For static decompositions, each effect can be evaluated in four different ways depending on the
choice of reference populations and coefficient vectors. For dynamic decompositions, two different
evaluations can be derived depending on the choice of reference years for population and coefficient
vectors.
7 This issue has been addressed by Meng and Miller (1995) for rural China.
8 Details are provided in Riskin, Zhao, and Li (2000). See also Gustafsson and Li (2000).
9 Sichuan province has been added in the 1995 survey. All other provinces are the same in both years:
Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu,Anhui, Henan, Guangdong,Yunnan, Gansu, and Hubei. For data
comparability, we restrict our analysis to the 10 provinces surveyed in the two years (see Gustafsson
and Li 2000).
10 Foreign-invested enterprises include both Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-owned enterprises.

can be used as a proxy for the advancement of market liberalization, state-owned
enterprises being the less-liberalized and FIEs the most liberalized, whatever the
year. Following Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002, p. 719), we can also "speculate
that the collective firms are intermediate cases since their budget constraints are
clearly firmer than those in the state sector."
The total annual earnings variable is defined as the sum of the basic wage,
bonuses, allowances (except those received for "waiting for a job," xiagang), sub-
sidies (including housing, health care, child care, and regional subsidies), other wages,
other income from the work unit, as well as income in kind.11 Moreover, to account
for regional price variations, earnings are adjusted for provincial purchasing power
differences, by using Brandt and Holz's (2006) urban provincial-level spatial price
deflators (the reference being nationwide prices in 1995).
B. Gender Differences in Earnings
Table 1 presents preliminary statistics on average salaries by ownership and by
sex, which provides an evaluation of the evolution of the gender earnings gap
between 1988 and 1995.As shown in this table, men are paid on average nearly 20%
more than women, the gap slightly narrowing over time from 18.7% in 1988 to
17.8% in 1995.12 In terms of ownership distribution, the gender earnings gap has
considerably reduced for FIEs (from 34.1% in 1988 to 11.1% in 1995), but to a lesser
extent for CSOEs and for UCEs, and it has remained stable for LSOEs (from 15.2%
to 15.3%). These nonuniform changes across ownership lead to quite different
patterns in terms of earnings differentials by sex between 1988 and 1995: in 1988,
the gap is by far the largest in FIEs, yet it is the smallest in 1995. In 1995, the highest
differential is observed in UCEs, followed by LSOEs and CSOEs. Hence, the overall
modest change in the male/female earnings gap between 1988 and 1995 results from
the combination of sizable contrasting evolutions within different ownership struc-
tures. Although consistent with both Qian (1996) and Gustafsson and Li (2000),
these results differ strongly from both Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) and Maurer-
Fazio and Hughes (2002), who highlight larger gender wage gaps in the most liber-
alized sectors. One explanation can be found in the different samples used in these
studies. Indeed, Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) only consider two cities. Moreover,
our finding of a large decrease in the gender earnings gap for FIEs between 1988 and
1995 stresses the fact that various years can exhibit quite different pictures. Hence,
Maurer-Fazio and Hughes' (2002) findings for 1991 can be seen as consistent with
11 As some people declare working only for part of the year, wages are adjusted to "full-year working
equivalent."
12 This result differs from Gustafsson and Li (2000), who found a modest increase in the gender wage
gap (from 18.5% to 21.2%). Two main reasons can explain this difference: first, our sample is
restricted to wage workers only and excludes private and individual enterprises, and second, we have
adjusted earnings for unemployed days.

our results, with a male/female wage differential for FIEs of 25.4%,13 which lies
within the values obtained here for 1988 and 1995.
Furthermore, Table 1 shows that the overall differential across the range of enter-
prises in 1995 is noticeably higher than differentials by ownership taken separately
(except for UCEs), which suggests that an important aspect of discrimination
against women arises from their being over-represented in enterprises paying lower
wages (UCEs), whereas men are proportionately more numerous in higher-paying
enterprises.14 This observation is consistent with Maurer-Fazio, Rawski, and
Zhang's (1999) findings at the aggregate level, indicating that a "large portion of the
gender wage differences in China's urban labor market arises because of the over-
representation of women in low-wage industries" (p. 81). This issue can be further
analyzed through reweighting procedures, as shown in Table 2. The use of a
common distribution by ownership (either that observed for men or that observed for
women) enables the monitoring of the impact of differences in distributions by owner-
ship between the two sexes. Our findings show that the proportion of the observed
earnings gap that can be directly attributed to differences in the distribution of men
and women across enterprises amounts to 3­4 percentage points. This indirect dis-
crimination arises from the fact that women are over-represented in low-wage
UCEs, whereas men are over-represented in higher-paying CSOEs.
The bottom part of Table 2 provides additional and complementary information
on the impact of differences in the male and female distributions across enterprises
on the gender earnings gap. Reweighting by the distribution observed for the other
year shows that half of the 0.9 percentage point decrease in the gender earnings gap
between 1988 and 1995 that is observed can be attributed to changes in the relative
employment between enterprises, which have been in favor of LSOEs for both men
and women from 1988 to 1995. Indeed, in 1995, LSOEs employed 55.2% of female
workers and 56.2% of male workers, while the shares in 1988 were respectively
38.6% and 42.2%. This concentration in LSOEs tends to homogenize the distribu-
tion of men and women across enterprises, which in turn reduces the importance of
ownership segregation in the gender earnings differential.
Another important aspect concerns the earnings distribution by sex within owner-
ship. Gini coefficients provided in Table 1 show some interesting features. First, in
1988, earnings inequality for both men and women was notably higher in FIEs,
13 The figure is computed from Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002, p. 720, Table 2), as the difference
between the average male wage and the average female wage as a percentage of the average female
wage.
14 The over-representation of women in low-paying collective enterprises is a well-documented
phenomenon of the Chinese labor market. As emphasized by Qian (1996, p. 79), it is "partially a
result of the Chinese government effort to mobilize women to participate in the labor market."
However, since the collective sector offers "lower wages, less benefits, and limited career
development, people consider it a less desirable sector."
106 the developing economies

where salaries were also by far the highest. Thus, earnings dispersion was the
highest in the most liberalized sector in 1988, which is consistent with Maurer-Fazio
and Hughes'(2002) findings for 1991. On the opposite side, earnings inequality was
the lowest in LSOEs, where Gini coefficients were only 18.4% for women and 19.5%
for men. Second, the comparison between 1988 and 1995 shows a large increase in
overall earnings inequality for both men (from 21.1% to 26.2%) and women (from
21.5% to 27.5%). Moreover, this increase has been especially sharp in both LSOEs
and UCEs. In terms of changes in earnings inequality over time, FIEs exhibit levels
of inequality quite similar to UCEs and LSOEs in 1995, since Gini coefficients only
slightly increased in FIEs. Hence, further liberalization of the economy between
1988 and 1995 led to higher earnings inequality within domestic enterprises and a
catching-up process, as compared to FIEs.
To further analyze the distribution issue, Figure 1 presents male/female observed
earnings differentials by earnings percentile of each gender income distribution for
each ownership type. Each curve should be read in terms of difference: for the
median, the curve represents the difference between male median and female

median earnings as a percentage of the female median earnings. The overall distri-
bution shows sizable changes between 1988 and 1995. Indeed, the rather flat curve
in 1988 turns into a down-sloping curve in 1995, stressing a higher gender differen-
tial at the bottom of the earnings scale. Hence, the overall gender earnings gap has
increased for low-wage earners, while it has decreased for high-wage earners.
Moreover, this relative deterioration of the earnings gap at the lower part of the
distribution can be found within each enterprise type, except for LSOEs, where the
evolution is less clear-cut.
IV. ESTIMATION RESULTS
Earnings regressions by enterprise ownership and by sex are reported in Table 3
for 1988 and in Table 4 for 1995.15 Since the choice of enterprise and the related
expected remuneration are closely linked, estimating earnings functions for
enterprises of different ownership would require controlling for potential selection

main reasons.16 First, since labor was still administratively allocated in China up to
1995, the enterprise choice cannot be fully considered as the result of an individual
choice.17 Second, achieving identification for enterprise choice is problematic since
no available variable can be considered as a fully exogenous instrument.18 Nonethe-
less, it should be stressed here that there may still be selectivity problems, which
calls for a cautious interpretation of our estimation results.
The dependent variable is the natural log of total annual earnings and explanatory
variables include individual human capital characteristics (education and experi-
ence), economic sector, geographical residence, and household characteristics.19
Given the small number of observations for FIEs, we are limited in the number of
explanatory variables that can be introduced without reducing the robustness of our
estimations.20 Moreover, the issue of which variable to include in the wage regres-
sion when measuring wage discrimination is highly controversial. On the one hand,
the choice of explanatory variables for the earnings equation may raise a concern for
the concept of wage discrimination, which commonly refers to the part of the un-
explained earnings gap between men and women. Because income variations across
regions or industries are potential important sources of gender earnings differentials,
more disaggregated levels for geographic and industrial attributes may be required.
Similarly, the potentially different distribution of men and women across positions
and occupations in the same enterprise may also account for the identified "gender
discrimination." However, some of these explanatory variables, including industry
and occupation, are clearly endogenous, with no variable in our data to credibly
instrument those endogenous variables. Hence, given data limitation, we chose to
limit the potential for endogeneity bias by estimating a reduced form of the earnings
equation, which does not include all the theoretically required explanatory variables.
We thus acknowledge that one should keep the potential omitted variable bias in
mind when interpreting the results. However, alternate specifications, including
extended specifications as well as a minimal specification including only human
capital variables (education and experience) have been estimated and all led to similar
decomposition results.21
16 Zhao (2002) and Chen, Démurger, and Fournier (2005) make similar choices.
17 In particular, until 1995, graduate students from universities in China were assigned to a particular
job according to central planning­related labor allocation mechanisms.
18 Chen, Démurger, and Fournier (2005) mention the relative employment shares in different enterprise
types at the city level as potential instruments. Information on cities is unfortunately not fully
reliable for 1988.
19 Reference categories for the regional location and economic sector are the non-coastal region and
secondary sector (industry and construction), respectively.
20 More detailed specifications for male and female earnings functions can be found in Gustafsson and
Li (2000), who, however, do not provide any distinction by ownership type.
21 All results presented in the rest of the paper are based on an intermediate specification. Robustness
tests using alternative (reduced or extended) specifications are available from the authors.

Another concern about the accuracy of our estimates can arise from the very small
number of observations for the foreign sector. Since it was still in its emerging phase
in 1995, the foreign sector was indeed accounting for a very small share of employ-
ment in China. Being aware of this strong weakness of the data, we nevertheless
chose to keep this category in our analysis as a reference category for the most
liberalized sector in 1995 only.Although we present results for both 1988 and 1995,
we do not interpret them for 1988 and remain cautious for 1995.
Earnings equation regressions reported in Table 3 and Table 4 show22 returns to
education ranging from 2.5% to 3.9% in 1988, depending on enterprise ownership,
and ranging from 2.9% to 9.9% in 1995. The only cases where education is not sig-
nificant are FIEs for men in 1995 and for both men and women in 1988, where the
much smaller number of observations certainly affects the robustness of our results.
For domestic enterprises, our results are consistent with the literature on returns to
education in urban China, including Li (2003), Yueh (2004), and Zhao (2002). In
terms of gender differences, our estimations show significant differences for both
central and local state-owned enterprises in 1988 and in 1995, returns to education
being higher for women.
The usual concave form for work experience23 is found for nearly all estimations,
the main exceptions being for FIEs. The estimation of separate earnings functions
by ownership shows that the remuneration of experience is not uniform across own-
ership and gender. Women tend to have steeper but more concave returns to experi-
ence than men, thus reaching their wage peak earlier. For women, experience is
significantly better rewarded in CSOEs than in LSOEs in 1988, and women's wage
premium for job experience in CSOEs is significantly higher than for men. For men,
experience is more uniformly remunerated across ownership. Lastly, the absence of
significant returns to experience in FIEs certainly comes from the fact that workers
in FIEs are much younger and have less experience. It also highlights a specificity
of this newly developed form of ownership, in which experience accumulated in
former state-owned enterprise positions may not be associated with efficiency gains.
Earnings differentials by geographical location in domestic enterprises show that
workers in coastal provinces earn on average 2­14% more than workers in inland
provinces in 1988 and that the gap significantly increased in 1995 to 23­43%. The
wage premium for being along the coast in 1988 was significantly lower in LSOEs
than in both CSOEs and UCEs for men and women. But, the strong increase in the
premium for LSOEs in 1995 led to a reversal of the relative position of LSOEs com-
pared to CSOEs, which became the lowest coastal wage premium-paying enterprise.
22 Comparisons of estimated coefficients across equations given in the following comments are made
only for differences that are statistically significant at the 10% level.
23 Experience is measured here as potential work experience calculated from age and the number of
years of schooling.

V. DECOMPOSITION RESULTS
A. Dynamic Evolution of Gender Wage Gaps, 1988­95
Table 5 provides evaluations of the impact of changes in both discrimination and
endowments on observed gender earnings differentials between 1988 and 1995 by
ownership. First, as discussed in Section III, it shows that the income gap between
men and women has decreased as a whole and for all ownerships, except for LSOEs,
over the 1988­95 period. However, the decomposition of the modest observed
decrease in the earnings gap reveals two opposite forces. First, the overall change in
endowments has led to a relative improvement for women as compared to men. If
alone, this change would have led to a much larger decrease in the overall gender
wage gap (5.1­5.5 percentage points instead of the observed 0.9 percentage point).
However, this equalizing force has been offset by a concomitant increase in dis-
crimination, which would have led to a 4.1­4.6 percentage points' increase in the
overall gender earnings gap, had endowments remained unchanged.
Figure 2 presents decomposition results on the earnings percentiles scale. It
shows that changes in endowments have had a rather uniform impact along the

earning scale, while rising discrimination has been much stronger at the bottom of
the distribution. This implies that the relative widening of the gender earnings gap
for low-wage earners as compared to high-wage earners mainly comes from a
stronger increase in discrimination for low-wage workers. This result is consistent
with Gustafsson and Li's (2000) findings that the earnings situation of young women
and women with limited education (thus, at the lower end of the female earnings
distribution) has especially deteriorated compared to men with similar characteristics.
It is also consistent with Bishop, Luo, and Wang's (2005) findings using quantile
regressions­based decomposition procedures.24
Turning to differences by ownership, Table 5 reveals quite different patterns
across enterprises, especially in terms of discrimination. Indeed, it shows an increase
in discrimination for both central and local state-owned enterprises (especially high
in LSOEs) and a decrease for UCEs.25 For CSOEs, the convergence in income
between men and women thus entirely comes from a catching-up in terms of endow-
ments, which may have been partly compensated by an increase in discrimination.
In the case of LSOEs, the catching-up in terms of endowments is fully compen-
sated by a strong rise in discrimination (between 5.5 and 5.7 percentage points),
which more strongly affected both the bottom and the top of the distribution
(Figure 2). An opposite feature characterizes UCEs since they experienced a
decrease in discrimination associated with diverging endowments. As shown in
Figure 2, the overall decrease in discrimination only affected the upper part of the
distribution, while among the poorest, discrimination seems to have increased.
These results reveal an interesting evolution in domestic enterprises' behaviors
throughout the reform period. Indeed, enterprises that experienced the greatest
increase in discrimination against women are state-owned enterprises, not UCEs,
where discrimination substantially decreased. As for the comparison of discrimina-
tory behaviors between state-owned enterprises and others, Meng and Miller (1995)
argue that where employment and wages are decided by the government, the gov-
ernment makes efforts to improve the position of women in order to counterbalance
traditional segregation against women inherited from Confucian thoughts. Our
results suggest that throughout the reform process, the government, and especially
local governments, have tended to pay less attention to this issue and have progres-
sively decreased their pressure on gender equality. Conversely, our results for UCEs
suggest that within these enterprises, market reforms and increased competition
24 Although Bishop et al. focus their comments on the decreasing share of the "unexplained"
component in the total gap, their results show a clear increase in the level of this component over
time for lower income levels (Bishop, Luo, and Wang 2005, p. 256, Tables 3a and 3b, column 5).
25 For FIEs, the impact is less straightforward, as suggested by the negative and positive signs of the
minimum and maximum interval. Since decompositions of earnings differentials for FIEs are made
on a very small sample for 1988, we do not interpret further these results and restrict the analysis of
gender discrimination in FIEs to 1995.

from other types of enterprises may have brought more "market-oriented" behav-
iors, leading to a decrease in costly and inefficient discrimination against women.26
B. Comparison between 1988 and 1995
Tables 6 and 7 present static decomposition results for 1988 and 1995, by owner-
ship, as discussed in Section II. In 1988, 5.8­7.3 percentage points of the observed
gap (31­39% of the total differential) came from differences in endowment between
men and women, and 11.4­12.9 percentage points (61­69% of the total differential)
came from discrimination against women. In 1995, the respective figures were
3.7­6.9 percentage points (21­39% of the total differential) for differences in
endowment and 10.8­14.0 percentage points (61­79% of the total differential) for
26 We should also note that, as it is controversial in the literature as to whether the unexplained portion
of the gender wage gap is attributable to gender discrimination in wages or to an unobserved
productivity difference between men and women, alternative interpretations for the residual wage
gap could also be given. For instance, the rising discrimination found in the State sector may also
reflect the fact that earnings in state-owned enterprises are becoming more related to the unobserved
skills of individual workers and less to their observable attributes, such as education attainment or
seniority over time. Similarly, the declining weight of the residual wage gap observed in the UCEs
could also be attributed to more individualistic initial wage structures.

discrimination. Thus, the shares of both components remained approximately
constant over time, discrimination against women explaining around two-thirds of
the total observed gender earnings differentials in urban China. This implies that
in the absence of discrimination, the gender earnings differential would have been
10­14 percentage points lower than the 18­19% differential observed in 1988 and
in 1995.
As for ownership categories, Tables 6 and 7 also show substantial differences in
the proportion of observed differentials arising from direct discrimination against
women. Indeed, in 1988, discrimination was particularly high in CSOEs and in
UCEs, where it explained most of the observed gender wage gap, while in LSOEs,
discrimination phenomena explained between 55 and 63% of the observed gap.
However, throughout the period, the most substantial change arose within LSOEs,
where discrimination sharply increased and explains most of the observed gender
wage differentials in 1995. These results confirm that market liberalization has had
a very different impact on discrimination against women across the different types
of domestic enterprises.
Turning to FIEs, our decompositions results highlight quite different features.
Since the number of observations is much smaller for these enterprises, especially
in 1988, we will limit interpretations to the year 1995 only. For this particular year,
our decompositions do not support the hypothesis of discrimination against women

in FIEs and even suggest some possible discrimination against men.27 Hence, in
1995, the most market-oriented enterprises were also those in which discrimination
against women was the lowest. As discussed for UCEs, this suggests that market
forces have helped reduce the gap between men and women by improving incentives
for enterprises to adopt rational behaviors. Our results for 1995 thus show a clear
opposition between domestic enterprises and FIEs. In the former, we find a marked
discrimination against women, which, combined with differences in average charac-
teristics, causes a large overall pay differential between men and women. In the
latter, the gender earnings differential is mainly due to differences in characteristics
and discrimination phenomena play no significant role. A higher level of discrimi-
nation in domestic enterprises than in FIEs supports the hypothesis that the search
for efficiency in FIES, which are more subject to market mechanisms, tends to
encourage flexibility and lower discrimination.
VI. CONCLUSION
Economic reforms and market liberalization in urban China from the mid-1980s
onwards have greatly affected gender wage differentials and discrimination against
women. As emphasized in this paper, the resulting changes are made up of a com-
plex set of evolutions across enterprises, earnings distributions, and time, which call
for a careful analysis. Our approach combines the time dimension to the ownership
dimension, adding new, valuable information to the understanding of the role played
by the reforms in gender wage gaps changes.
First, we find that the overall gender wage gap has been slightly narrowing over
time, from 18.7% in 1988 to 17.7% in 1995. This modest change is shown to result
from contrasting evolutions across different ownership structures, with a decreasing
differential observed for FIEs, CSOEs, and UCEs, and an increasing differential for
LSOEs. Second, wage dispersion is found to be the highest in the most liberalized
sector in 1988, but further liberalization of the economy between 1988 and 1995 led
to a rise in wage inequality within domestic enterprises, resulting in a catching-up
of FIEs. Third, we find that while the overall gender earnings gap has remained
grossly stable, it has increased for the lower deciles of the wage distribution and
decreased for high-wage earners.
As for discrimination against women, we first show that part of the observed wage
differential arises from women being over-represented in enterprises paying lower
wages, whereas men are proportionately more numerous in high-paying enterprises.

is negligible.

women across enterprises lead to a first form of discrimination against women: the
proportion of the observed earnings gap that may be directly attributed to these
differences amounts to 3­4 percentage points. Moreover, in dynamic terms, half
of the 0.9 percentage point decrease observed in the gender earnings gap between
1988 and 1995 comes from evolutions in distribution structures of men and women
across enterprises.
Decomposing gender earnings differentials into endowment differences and dis-
crimination phenomena allows for further exploration of the discrimination issue.
First, our results indicate that in 1988, discrimination was quite strong in domestic
enterprises and mainly affected the top deciles of the female earnings distribution.
Hence, at the beginning of the industrial reforms, discrimination against women was
most prominent in qualified occupations, whereas it was much lower for low-paying
jobs. This implies that at the end of the 1980s, the government's control over wage-
setting aiming at gender equality was better enforced for lower wages than for the
highest-paying jobs. Second, economic reforms brought about some significant
changes to discriminatory behaviors, which have affected differently the various
segments of the urban labor market. Our results highlight a rise in discrimination in
state-owned enterprises, concentrated at the bottom of the earnings distribution.
These changes can be considered as reflecting a "catching-up" of discrimination
along the female earnings distribution since the discrimination pattern in 1995 is
quite flat across income deciles. Conversely, UCEs experienced decreasing discri-
mination, affecting the top of the distribution and leading to an equalization of
discrimination on the income scale. Lastly, our results do not support the hypothesis
of discrimination against women for FIEs in 1995 and even seem to suggest the
possibility of discrimination against men. In distributive terms, they indicate that
discriminatory behaviors are restricted to low-wage female earners.
Market liberalization thus appears to have affected quite differently enterprises of
different ownership. On the one hand, our results suggest that the Chinese State has
paid less attention to the gender equality issue over time, while on the other hand,
market competition seems to have helped reduce discriminatory behaviors. More-
over, our findings stress quite unequal changes across the range of earnings distribu-
tion from 1988 to 1995: while in 1988, discrimination tended to be highest for the
higher deciles of the earnings distribution, the trend has been either annulated or
reversed by 1995. The richest women have thus seen their relative position improv-
ing while the poorest have seen their relative position deteriorating.28
Consistent with Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) and Maurer-Fazio and Hughes
(2002), our results highlight the interplay of opposing forces, economic reforms
contributing to changes in entrepreneurs' (or managers') behaviors in various
28 Relative improvement or deterioration here are to be understood in terms of a difference in
differences: women's earnings relative to men's earnings at different positions on the income scale.

dimensions. First, the decentralization process led to a growing importance of
decentralized choices in wage-setting decisions, leaving space for managers' pre-
ferences and potentially unequal treatment of women. Thus, moving from the com-
munist egalitarian ideology to a decentralized system of wage determination seems
to have led to an increase in discrimination in LSOEs, and to a lesser extent, in
CSOEs. Our results also suggest that discriminatory behaviors against women have
increased the most at the bottom of the earnings distribution, which was still most
protected in 1988, thus leading to a more equal distribution of discrimination along
the wage scale. Second, economic reforms not only brought about decentralization
but also market competition, which is expected to favor more efficient behaviors in
terms of wage-setting. Discrimination being a source of inefficiency, further liber-
alization may tend to reduce discriminatory behaviors, which is what our results
suggest for UCEs over time and, to some extent, in 1995 for the comparison of FIEs
and domestic enterprises.
Different forces are thus at work to explain changes in gender discrimination,
which are related to differences in the institutional structure of the various types of
enterprises. On the one hand, by relaxing institutional rules, market liberalization
weakened both the central and local governments' equalizing role on wage-setting
rules, leaving space for discrimination to arise in state-owned enterprises. Our
results suggest that this is especially true for LSOEs, which have experienced a large
increase in discrimination. Being of a smaller size and farther from the direct control
of the central government, these enterprises enjoyed a greater discretion in wage
determination although still protected from competition and benefiting from soft
budget constraints. On the other hand, increased competition induced by the
development of market mechanisms actually favored the reduction of discriminating
behaviors in enterprises outside the State planning structure, as highlighted here for
both UCEs and FIEs. These concomitant and opposite evolutions can explain why,
at the aggregate level, changes are so modest. They also confirm results from Liu,
Meng, and Zhang (2000) and Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002) about the difficulty
of assessing the role of economic reforms on the relative position of women in urban
China.
