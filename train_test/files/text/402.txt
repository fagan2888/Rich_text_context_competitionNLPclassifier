Abstract
Osteoporosis, defined by low bone mineral density (BMD), is common among postmenopausal women. The distribution of
BMD varies across populations and is shaped by both environmental and genetic factors. Because the candidate gene
vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) generates vitamin K quinone, a cofactor for the gamma-
carboxylation of bone-related proteins such as osteocalcin, we hypothesized that VKORC1 genetic variants may be
associated with BMD and osteoporosis in the general population. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs in
7,159 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is a nationally
representative sample linked to health and lifestyle variables including BMD, which was measured using dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) on four regions of the proximal femur. In adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity and sex, SNPs
rs9923231 and rs9934438 were associated with increased BMD (p = 0.039 and 0.024, respectively) while rs8050894 was
associated with decreased BMD (p = 0.016) among non-Hispanic black males (n = 619). VKORC1 rs2884737 was associated
with decreased BMD among Mexican-American males (n = 795; p = 0.004). We then tested for associations between VKORC1
SNPs and osteoporosis, but the results did not mirror the associations observed between VKORC1 and BMD, possibly due to
small numbers of cases. This is the first report of VKORC1 common genetic variation associated with BMD, and one of the
few reports available that investigate the genetics of BMD and osteoporosis in diverse populations.

Introduction
The candidate gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex
subunit 1 (VKORC1) was first identified as part of the vitamin K
epoxide reductase multiprotein complex (VKOR) in 2004 [1,2].
The product of VKORC1 is a rate-controlling enzyme in the
vitamin cycle and is essential for the production of vitamin-K-
dependent, c-carboxylated proteins such as clotting factors II, VII,
IX, X protein C, S, and Z. Thus, VKORC1 has broad implications
for clotting, a property well-appreciated: even before the gene was
identified, VKOR has long been the target of warfarin, a
commonly prescribed anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and
other thromboembolic events. It is now known that rare mutations
in VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance, and common polymor-
phisms in VKORC1 account a large proportion of the variability of
warfarin dosing in most populations studied [3].
In addition to having broad effects on the coagulation cascade,
the vitamin K cycle is also essential in the formation of the bone
matrix. Vitamin K, which is synthesized by plants (K1
) and
bacteria in the gut (K2
), is a required co-enzyme for the c-
carboxylation of three glutamic acid (Glu) residues in osteocalcin,
converting them to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). This post-
translational Glu to Gla modification of osteocalcin, a bone and
dentin protein produced by osteoblasts, is necessary for calcium
binding. Evidence suggests that vitamin K1
deficiency is associated
with decreased BMD [4,5] and that high-dose vitamin K
supplementation prevents fractures in at-risk patients [6]. Also,
some inconsistent evidence suggests that long-term warfarin
therapy, which by design inhibits the vitamin K cycle and
prevents the Glu to Gla modification, is associated with low BMD
in patients compared with patients not on warfarin-therapy [5,7].
This latter observation in humans, however, is not supported by
recent experiments in male rhesus macaques that demonstrate
long-term warfarin therapy does not affect BMD while on a diet
high in calcium and vitamin D [8].
Despite the discordant observations between humans and
macaques, preliminary studies in humans suggest that VKORC1
common variation is associated with mean undercarboyxlated
osteocalcin [9] and dietary vitamin K intake [9,10]. Based on role
of VKORC1 in the vitamin K cycle and based on the preliminary
data presented in other studies, we hypothesized that common
VKORC1 genetic variation is associated with BMD in humans. To
test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs (rs9923231,
rs9934438, rs2359612, rs8050894, rs2884737, rs7294) in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) and tested for associations with measures of

BMD. Four of these tagSNPs (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs2359612,
and rs8050894) are known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium
with one another and are associated with warfarin dosing in
populations of European-descent [3,11,12]. We also tested for
associations between VKORC1 SNPs and osteoporosis, an extreme
phenotype of BMD. Unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that
VKORC1 SNPs are associated with these bone phenotypes in
human, but their effect size is likely small compared with other
genetic and non-genetic factors.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Participants were consented by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) at the time of the survey and sample
collection, and consent included the storage of data and biological
specimens such as blood for future research [13]. The present
study was approved by the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because
the study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers,
this study was considered non-human subjects research by the
Vanderbilt University Internal Review Board.
NHANES III was conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC.
NHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey
designed to represent non-institutionalized Americans at the time
of ascertainment [14,15]. NHANES is also a complex, multi-stage
survey that oversamples minorities (non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican-Americans), children, and the elderly. Sampling weights
are calculated and provided for analysis to account for non-
response bias and to adjust for the oversampling of specific groups
so that all estimates are nationally representative. All participants
were asked to complete a household interview and physical
examination in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). If the
participant was not able to visit the MEC, a home examination
was arranged. During Phase 2 of NHANES III (1991­1994), cell
lines were established from blood samples of participants .12
years of age. The total number of NHANES III phase 2
participants was 16,530, and sample weights were recalculated
using methods previously described [16] for participants with
DNA samples to avoid non-response bias. NHANES III DNA
samples became available to study investigators beginning in 2002
[13,17­19].
BMD of the proximal femur was measured during the physical
exam on non-pregnant female and male participants at least 20
years of age using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [20].
Bone mineral content and BMD are available for the femur neck
region (gm/cm2), the trochanter region (gm/cm2), the inter-
trochanter region (gm/cm2), the Ward's triangle region (gm/cm2),
and the total region (gm/cm2). Cotinine levels were determined in
participants using STC Diagnostics cotinine enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) kits (Bethlehem, PA). Serum vitamin D levels were
determined in participants using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay
(RIA) kit (formerly the INCSTAR 25-OH-D assay; Stillwater,
MN) [21].
Genotyping
NHANES III DNA samples were distributed as aliquots of
crude cell lysates to study investigators. NHANES III DNA
concentrations vary and are estimated to range from 7.5­65 ng/
mL with an average of approximately four micrograms in 100 ul.
NHANES III DNA samples are distributed in 96-well plates along
with four 96-well plates of CDC-supplied blinded duplicates and
blank controls. NHANES III experimental DNA samples are
randomly distributed across plates without regard to race/
ethnicity, sex, or case/control status. NHANES III DNA samples
represent several major racial/ethnic groups, including non-
Hispanic whites (n = 2,631), non-Hispanic blacks (n = 2,018),
Mexican-Americans (n = 2,073), and other racial/ethnic groups
(n = 437).
TagSNPs were selected using LDselect [22] and the MultiPop-
TagSelect algorithm [23] as previously described [3] for non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. A total of 16 tagSNPs
were considered for genotyping. VKORC1 rs17880887 could not
be successfully converted into a genotyping assay and was omitted
from further genotyping attempts. Five tagSNPs were targeted for
genotyping because they represent the vast majority of common
variation in European-descent populations [3]. These five tagSNPs
also represent the haplotypes associated with warfarin dosing in
both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks [12,24]. A
sixth SNP (rs9923231), which is redundant with rs9934438 in both
non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, was targeted for
genotyping given that there is evidence this is the functional SNP
in the association with warfarin dosing [11,25].
A total of six SNPs were genotyped in 7,159 DNA samples in
NHANES III: rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, rs2359612,
rs2884737, and rs7294 (Table 1 and Table S1). All SNPs were
genotyped using Applied Biosystem's TaqManH SNP Genotyping
Assays (Foster City, CA) except for rs2884737, which was
genotyped using Sequenom's iPLEXH Gold coupled with
MassARRAY MALDI-TOF MS detection (San Diego, CA).
The SNP genotyping call rates ranged from 90% to 99%, with an
average call rate of ,95%. All SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg
Equilibrium (HWE) at p.0.05, and all SNPs passed CDC quality
control measures based on tests of HWE on the experimental
DNA samples and 368 blinded duplicates on CDC-supplied
control plates. All genotypes have been deposited into CDC's
Genetic NHANES database and are available for secondary
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted remotely in SAS v9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) using the Analytic Data Research by
Email (ANDRE) portal of the CDC Research Data Center in
Hyattsville, MD. All analyses presented here were performed
weighted. Unweighted analyses were not substantially different
compared with weighted analyses (data not shown).
Linear regressions stratified by sex and race/ethnicity were
performed where BMD was the dependent variable. Models were
adjusted for the following variables: age (in years; continuous),
body mass index (kg/m2; continuous), current smoking status
(defined by ``do you smoke cigarettes now?'' or cotinine levels
.15 ng/ml; binary); family history of osteoporosis (``Doctor told
mother she had osteoporosis''; binary), thyroid disease (``Doctor
ever told you had thyroid disease''; binary), menopause (defined as
a woman .60 years of age answering ``no'' to ``have you had a
period in the past 12 months'' or as a woman with bilateral
oophorectomy answering ``yes'' to ``have you had one or both
ovaries removed'' and ``both removed''; binary); hysterectomy
(``have you had a hysterectomy''; binary), education (defined as
less than high school, high school, and greater than high school
from ``highest grade or year completed''; categorical), use of
hormone replacement therapy (defined as ``ever/never'' from
three questions: ``ever take estrogen by mouth,'' ``have you ever
taken or used estrogen or female hormones in the form of vaginal
cream,'' and ``have you ever used female hormones in the form of
patches that are placed on the skin''; binary), and oral
contraceptive use (``have you ever taken birth control pills for

any reason?''; binary). Dietary variables such as calcium (mg;
continuous) and alcohol consumption (gm; continuous) were
defined from the 24-hour dietary recall.
Logistic regression was performed where osteoporosis was the
dependent variable. Osteoporosis was defined as less than or equal
to 22.5 standard deviations from the mean BMD total region.
The mean BMD used to define cases and controls is based on
participants 20­29 years of age in each sex and race/ethnicity
group, which is based on the criteria outlined by WHO in 1994 (as
described in [26]). We adjusted models using the same variables
from the linear regression.
SNPs were included in both the linear and logistic regression
models assuming an additive genetic model (genotypes coded as 0,
1, and 2). SNPs were first included in the model without
adjustment and then included in the fully adjusted models.
Results
The study population characteristics are given in Table 2. For
each VKORC1 SNP, unadjusted tests of association for BMD total
region were performed assuming additive genetic model stratified
by race/ethnicity and sex (Table 3). Among non-Hispanic black
males, two SNPs were significantly associated with increased BMD
(rs9923231, p = 0.015 and rs9934438, p = 0.004), and one SNP
was significantly associated with decreased BMD (rs8050894,
p = 0.014). One SNP, rs7294, was associated with decreased BMD
among non-Hispanic white males (p = 0.011). No significant
associations were identified in non-Hispanic white females, non-
Hispanic black females, or Mexican American males or females.
Adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, maternal
family history of osteoporosis, thyroid disease, menopause,
hysterectomy, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement
therapy, education level, alcohol consumption, dietary calcium
and vitamin K, and serum levels of vitamin D did not appreciably
alter the associations observed in the unadjusted analyses (Table 4).
That is, SNPs rs9923231 and rs9934438 were both associated with
increased BMD (p = 0.039 and 0.024) and rs8050894 was
associated with decreased BMD among non-Hispanic black males
(p = 0.016). VKORC1 SNP rs7294 was no longer associated among
non-Hispanic white males. SNP rs2884737, which was not
significant in unadjusted models, was significantly associated with
decreased BMD among Mexican-American males (p = 0.004).
Given that VKORC1 SNPs were associated with BMD total
region, we tested whether VKORC1 SNPs were associated with
osteoporosis. In unadjusted tests of association, only rs7294 was
associated with osteoporosis. This significant association
(p = 0.001) was observed only among non-Hispanic white males
(odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.45, 0.79; Table
S2). After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status,
maternal family history of osteoporosis, thyroid disease, education
level, alcohol consumption, dietary calcium and vitamin K, and
serum levels of vitamin D, the association between rs7294 and
osteoporosis among non-Hispanic white males remained signifi-
cant (p = 0.04; OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.98; Table S3).
Adjusted models also revealed a significant association not
observed in unadjusted analyses (Table S3). Specifically,
rs8050894 was associated with osteoporosis in Mexican-American
males (p = 0.03; OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.87).
Discussion
We genotyped six SNPs in the candidate gene VKORC1 in 7,159
participants of NHANES III to determine if these common genetic
variants contribute to the variability in BMD in the general
population. Previous studies suggested that the vitamin K cycle is
essential to the formation of the bone matrix. Furthermore, patients
on long-term warfarin therapy, of which VKORC1 is the target, have
on average lower BMD compared with those not on long term
warfarin [7]. Our results suggest that common variants in VKORC1
are indeed associated with BMD and perhaps osteoporosis, but many
of these results are limited to African Americans. Also, the VKORC1
SNPs, while associated at p,0.05, contribute very little to variability
of BMD (,1%) compared with other risk factors, making it unlikely
that this locus is a major contributor to BMD as a main effect.
The weak contribution of VKORC1 SNPs on BMD and
osteoporosis is not surprising given that BMD and osteoporosis

are complex traits likely influenced by both genetics and the
environment. Twin and family studies suggest 40­80% of the
variability observed in BMD in various study populations can be
attributable to genetics [27­33]. Likewise, for osteoporosis, a
family history of the condition is strongly associated with cases
compared with controls [34,35]. To date, the genetic component
described in these twin and family studies seems to consist of many
common genetic variants, each with very small effects. That is,
candidate gene [36­39] and genome-wide association studies
[28,40­46] have identified .20 genes or genomic regions
associated with hip and spine BMD and/or osteoporosis, each
with effect sizes explaining ,1 to 4% of the variability in BMD or
with an odds ratio of ,1.5 for osteoporosis.
This is the first report of an association between BMD and
osteoporosis and these VKORC1 SNPs in the literature. VKORC1
genetic variation on chromosome 16 is not in linkage disequilib-
rium with genetic variation known to be associated with BMD
(such as ESR1 variants on chromosome 6 [47]) through GWAS
and candidate gene studies. Thus, the associations reported here
could represent false-positive findings or could represent associa-
tions that fall below the accepted threshold for significance in
genome-wide association studies (p,5.061028). It is interesting to
note, however, that our associations in BMD are mostly limited to
African American males. To date, few GWAS studies have been
performed in populations of non-European descent for BMD or
osteoporosis, and none have been reported for populations of
African-descent. This latter situation has an impact on our ability
to replicate the associations described here as GWA studies
available in dbGaP [48], the public repository for genotypes and
phenotypes, are not from populations of similar genetic ancestry
(i.e., the Framingham Heart Study is of European-descent). For
early replication studies, the preferred sequence of events is to first
replicate and confirm associations in populations of similar genetic
ancestry before performing characterization studies in other
racial/ethnic populations [49].
Indeed, differences in genetic variation and linkage disequilib-
rium patterns may explain, in part, the population-specific
associations described here. As already previously described
[3,50], the linkage disequilibrium pattern in VKORC1 differs
between European-descent and African-descent populations, with
the latter having less pair-wise LD. Four of the six SNPs
(rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, and rs2359612) genotyped in
NHANES III are in strong LD in the non-Hispanic white
subpopulation, but only two (rs9923231 and rs9934438) are in LD
in the non-Hispanic black subpopulation. Intronic rs8050894 is
not in LD with other genotyped VKORC1 SNPs in non-Hispanic
blacks and was associated with decreased BMD in males. This
SNP, along with the three in LD with it, was not associated with
BMD in the non-Hispanic white population. It is possible this
independent association observed in non-Hispanic black males is
tagging a genetic variant not genotyped in this study that is more
common in African-descent populations compared with Europe-
an-descent populations. In contrast, the two SNPs in LD in non-
Hispanic black males were associated with increased BMD, but,
again, neither these SNPs nor the two SNPs in LD with them were
associated with BMD in non-Hispanic whites. The lack of
association observed in non-Hispanic whites is less straightforward
given that experimental evidence suggests 59 flanking rs9923231
affects VKORC1 gene expression [25]. Nevertheless, it is still
possible that the association with increased BMD in non-Hispanic
blacks also represents an unknown genetic variant tagged by
rs9923231 and rs9934438.
In relation to VKORC1's association with warfarin dosing, it is
interesting that the minor alleles of rs9923231 and rs9934438 are
associated with increased BMD in non-Hispanic black males. The
minor alleles of these two VKORC1 SNPs are also associated with
decreased warfarin dose compared with the major alleles [11].
And, several studies have shown that these VKORC1 minor alleles
are associated with decreased VKORC1 expression in liver [12,25].
NHANES III participants are drawn from the general population,
so the relationship between warfarin dose, BMD, and VKORC1
could not be directly assessed in this population.
Of note, also, is the sex-specific nature of the associations
described here. It is already known that mean BMD differs by

VKORC1 and Bone Mineral Density in NHANES III

both sex and race/ethnicity [20,51], and sex differences are also
supported in mouse models [52]. Additionally, previous segrega-
tion, linkage, and association studies support sex-specific genetic
effects for BMD [53,54] and osteoporosis-related fractures [37]. It
is unlikely that power explains the lack of associations observed
among non-Hispanic black females given that the sample size for
this subgroup (n = 809) is larger than the non-Hispanic black male
subgroup (n = 619). Also, in adjusted analyses, we included the
same demographic and dietary variables in all sex-specific models,
with the only differences related to female-only variables (such as
menopause, oral contraceptive use, and hormone replacement
therapy). We cannot rule out the possibility that unknown
variables (confounders) are responsible for the observed associa-
tions in males only; nevertheless, the sex-specific effects are
intriguing and warrant further study.
This is a large, population-based study of a diverse sample from
the United States. Despite the strength of sample size for BMD,
this study has several limitations. First, the age range of the study is
wide, as participants in NHANES III aged 12 years and greater
are available for Genetic NHANES III, and those $20 years have
BMD measurements available. Attempts to examine older adults
with BMD are hampered by small sample sizes within any one
subgroup, as evidenced by the small number of cases of
osteoporosis. Second, our study is a candidate gene study and
necessarily limited compared with genome-wide association
studies. Third, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons using
Bonferroni correction given this method is conservative when
SNPs are linkage disequilibrium with one another [55]. Even if we
chose to adjust using Bonferroni, it is not clear how to implement
this correction given each subpopulation has a distinct pattern of
linkage disequilibrium for this candidate gene [3]. Therefore, we
present here unadjusted p-values. Finally, Genetics NHANES III
does not have ancestry informative markers or GWAS data
available to adjust for population stratification. We used self-
reported race/ethnicity to stratify NHANES prior to analysis.
While population stratification may still be a concern in this study,
it is worth noting that previous studies have found self-reported
race/ethnicity is highly concordant with genetic ancestry deter-
mined by genetic markers [56].
In conclusion, we describe several sex- and race/ethnic-specific
associations between BMD and VKORC1 SNPs in adults
ascertained for a large, population-based cross-sectional survey
of the United States. This is the first report of VKORC1 SNPs
associated with BMD; therefore, further studies are required to
replicate and characterize the association to establish this
candidate gene as a locus relevant to BMD and perhaps associated
phenotypes such as osteoporosis.
