Introduction
The problem of abandoned buildings and areas is usually
confronted while planning and managing urban, rural, and
rural­urban interface areas. With reference toAntuchevicien
(2005), it can be stated that the main reasons why the aban-
doned buildings and areas emerge are the changes in the
political, social, and economic systems that are usually fol-
lowed by the decline of the usual economic activities, the
decline in the number of jobs, and the consequent degrada-
tion of the entire areas. Lithuania and other postcommunist
countries in Central and Eastern Europe are the relevant
examples of this case.
This article concentrates on the relicts of the Soviet rural
landscape, especially the agricultural areas with the extant
farm buildings (as far as the residential buildings related with
the collective farms usually maintain their original function,
especially in the proximity to the urban centers), in the areas
of rural­urban interface in Lithuania. The aim of the research
was to highlight the sociocultural, economic, ecological, and
aesthetic problems related with the relicts of the Soviet rural
landscapes in the areas of rural­urban interface and to dem-
onstrate their redevelopment potential by formulating the
scenarios for integrating these areas and buildings into urban
development using the case of Lithuania.
The methodologies applied for research include the review
of literature, the preliminary surveys on site and recording in
photographs of the landscapes in the areas of rural­urban
interface surrounding the largest cities and particularly the
city of Kaunas in Lithuania, and construction of the hypo-
thetical scenarios. To understand better the sociocultural,
socioeconomic, and ecoaesthetic aspects related with aban-
doned agricultural properties of the Soviet era in Lithuania,
the sociological research was necessary. To our knowledge,
no sociological research had fully addressed this sociocultural
aspect regarding Lithuanian landscape. To provide the pre-
liminary answers to relevant questions, here we use the results
of the pilot surveys of the farmers and general society of
Lithuania regarding the possibilities of reuse of agricultural
complexes carried out by Rubikait (2013) in the frame of
this research. Fifty farmers and 100 respondents reflecting
general sociodemographic composition of the society were
surveyed using written questionnaires.
The contributions to new knowledge of this research con-

Abstract
The article deals with the possible reuse of the relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes in the areas of rural­urban interface
of a postcommunist country using the Lithuanian example. It presents the short review of the development and features of
the Soviet rural landscape in Lithuania; the analysis of the sociocultural, economic, ecological, and aesthetic issues related
to the relicts of this type of landscape under the pressures of urbanization; and the discussion of the potential of the relicts
of the Soviet rural landscape in the areas of rural­urban interface. The analysis of potential includes the discussion of the
premises of integration of these landscape relicts in the development of the areas of rural­urban interface; formulation
of seven integration scenarios--from renaturalization to urbanization; and the identification of the conditions for their
implementation, their possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and the possibilities to develop the types of
sustainable landscape distinguished by Nohl with corresponding aesthetic character in these areas.

Rural Landscape of the Soviet Period
and Its Contemporary Relicts in
Lithuania
In the Central and Eastern European region, in general, and
in Lithuania, in particular, the rural landscapes and the marks
of different transformations in them play an important part in
local identity and distinctiveness (Bucas, 1988, 2001; Palang
et al., 2006). For example, today rural landscapes of different
qualities embodying different historical transformations con-
stitute the largest part of the territory of Lithuania (Bukantis
et al., 2008). As a contrast to landscapes shaped by the coher-
ent evolution, these landscapes still bear the significant
marks of countryside transformations caused by the subse-
quent land reforms and the collective efforts of the popula-
tion. According to the researchers, this type of landscape
character causes the landscape perception difficulties and
creates specific management and planning challenges. For
example, Palang et al. (2006) in their research on "The
Forgotten Rural Landscapes of Central and Eastern Europe"
concluded that
quickly changing socioeconomic formations have encouraged
alienation, as people are not able to identify themselves with
too-rapidly-changing postmodern landscapes. The time barriers
between the formations are so thick that people do not understand
the context of the former formations; meanwhile, the time layers
are also so thin that new landscapes (both material and mental)
have had no time to become traditional. (p. 355)
This is particularly true with the Lithuanian rural land-
scapes, especially those that are the object of our research:
related with the complex and ambiguous Soviet period and
currently experiencing the pressure of urbanization and the
rapid change.
For the better understanding of the dynamics in the of
Lithuanian rural landscape, based on the analysis of develop-
ment of Lithuanian rural landscape and the crucial points of
its change, Bucas (1988, 2001) had distinguished four his-
toric Lithuanian rural landscape types, the relicts of which
can be seen in the country's landscape of today (Figure 1):
ikivalakinis (landscape developed before the land reform of
the 16th century), valakinis (landscape developed after the
land reform of the 16th century), vienkieminis (landscape of
the interwar period), and kolukinis (landscape of the Soviet
period). He notes that although ikivalakinis, valakinis, and
vienkieminis landscapes have taken over and integrated
many features of preexisting landscape types and simultane-
ously acquired new features depending on the circumstances
of the era, during the Soviet period, when the land was
nationalized and large collective farms were created, the
most drastic landscape changes took place, and the landscape
character and functioning were strongly altered.
To understand better the reasons and the nature of the
changes of rural landscape and the peculiarities of the rural­
urban interface of the Soviet period, it is necessary to look at
the ideological, economic, and social transformations of that
era and the value system and historical conditions underlying
the radical changes in lifestyle and in the construction and
farming practices in the Soviet era. The still traditional soci-
ety with the continuous agricultural practices and the eco-
nomics of the early capitalism of the pre­World War II
Lithuania were drastically replaced with the society shaped
by the ideology of socialism, where the collective values
were given the priority at the expense of individualism with
the attempt to create the just and classless society (Gentile,
Tammaru, & van Kempen, 2012) and with the centrally
planned economy and the fast modernization of agriculture
and production and rapid industrialization and urbanization
of the country.
Bucas (1988, 2001) has described in detail the structural,
functional, aesthetic, and sociocultural features of the rural
landscape of the Soviet period. Based on his analysis, here
we distinguish the main aspects important to this research:
Industrial Scale
The Soviet period was characterized by the intensive devel-
opment of industrial agricultural production in the rural
areas. Growing crop and livestock on the industrial scale
required building the large agricultural complexes and the
specialized farms with corresponding infrastructure.
Radical Reorganization of the Settlements System
The structure and network of residential settlements in rural
areas were altered accordingly: The functions of the settle-
ments have been changed; part of the existing historic settle-
ments were strongly modified and expanded, thus loosing
authenticity; the others were declared as nonperspective, and
Grazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 3
their development was not encouraged; many historic home-
steads strongly interconnected with the landscape were sim-
ply eliminated; and new concentrated settlements emerged.
Interrupted Buildings and Planting Traditions
New building materials, such as silicate bricks, sharply con-
trasted both with traditional architecture and the green struc-
tures.Numerousorchardsandnaturalgreeneryweredestroyed.
Even if development of new rural settlements included parks
and other public greenery, there were many cases when settle-
ments were built in the open fields without any green areas
with trees and shrubs. New settlements were not created in
harmony with the existing landscape forms, but on the con-
trary, based on the Soviet ideology, expressed the efficiency
and standardization of the living environment.
Radical Change in the Landscape's Structure and
Character
After cutting down trees and shrubs and implementing the
large melioration projects, the large, regular, and uniform open
areas with sparsely located tracts of wood were created. Even
if economically and technically effective, these spaces were
both disorientating for the observer and aesthetically unat-
tractive and ecologically unsustainable, creating monocultural
fields and causing land degradation. The industrial agricultural
production complexes of unusual shapes, materials and large
volumes, engineering infrastructure (roads, electricity trans-
mission lines), melioration and irrigation equipment, and
other interventions had radically transformed Lithuanian land-
scape into the plain agricultural and industrial environments.
Restructuring of the landscapes and the settlement system
caused the decline of regional ethnographic identities and
distinctiveness.
Some features of urbanization and the transformations of
rural­urban interface of the Soviet era have to be mentioned as
well. The gradual, compact, and moderate in size and pace
urban growth and the insignificant or moderate visual rural­
urban interface and clear visual, social, cultural, and economic
limits between the urban settlements and the countryside of
the interwar Lithuania were replaced with the rapid and large
scale, centrally planned and nondemocratic urban growth,
based on the industrialization of the construction sector, the
strict functional zoning, and "standardized housing estates,
whose ubiquitousness is one of the most striking visual fea-
tures of the Central and Eastern European city" (Gentile et al.,
2012, p. 291). The radical visual contrast between the fringe of
the city, characterized by the strict lines and brutal aesthetics
of the concrete blocks of flats and the industrial areas, and the
open agricultural areas or natural landscape had emerged at
that time in the country's landscape.
The interventions of the Soviet period failed to harmonize
the economic, cultural, and aesthetic needs of the society and
to achieve the environmental sustainability. Moreover, the
restoration of country's independence in 1990 and the related

political and economic reforms had again strongly altered
the situation. Similar changes had occurred in many coun-
tries that were a part of the former Soviet bloc: The socialism
with its relative equality and the centrally planned economy
were rapidly replaced with capitalism, the ideology of neo-
liberalism, and the subsequent social stratification (Gentile
et al., 2012). The influence of these changes on landscape
was not envisaged or even considered (Bucas, 2001). Some
effects of this shift on the rural areas can be mentioned: the
return of land to the owners, the privatization of property, the
abandonment of surplus farmland, the expansion of forests,
the migration of young people to the cities, the aging popula-
tion, the collapse of the rural infrastructure, and the decay of
old houses and rural buildings (Bell, Penze, Nikodemus, &
Montarzino, 2008; Kuemmerle et al., 2011).
For example, in Lithuania in the initial years of indepen-
dence from 1990 to 2004, the proportion of cultivated agricul-
tural land had decreased by 10% to 12% (Lygis, 2000). The
urban reality and the expression of rural­urban interface have
changed considerably as well. Contemporary trends can be
described as the demographically shrinking and territorially
expanding cities (Cereskevicius, 2012) and the suburbaniza-
tion or the urban sprawl (Gentile et al., 2012), resulting in
virtually unregulated spot-like urban expansion to the coun-
tryside and natural areas. The research carried out by the
Institute of Geology and Geography ("Krastovaizdzio," 2008)
identified landscape changes in the territory of the country
based on the selected landscape monitoring areas at the local
level in the period between 1974-1993 and 2006. The research
results reflect the above-mentioned trends (Figure 2): the
decline of the agrarian areas, the processes of landscape
renaturalization reflected in the increase of the scrubby areas
in almost all the territory of the country, and the intensifica-
tion of the construction activities. The landscape change
trends remain similar during the period of 2006-2013 as the
analysis of land cover (Aplinkos apsaugos agentra, 2014)
demonstrates: the decrease of pastures, mainly due to renatu-
ralization and the expansion of construction activities at the
expense of agricultural areas.
This research mainly focuses on the relicts of the Soviet
rural landscape in the zones of influence of the largest
Lithuanian cities as demonstrated in Figure 1. As the territories

of these cities had expanded due to the recent real estate boom
(Pakalnis & Bardauskien, 2012) and continue to grow, the
increasing number of the relicts of historic rural landscapes,
including landscapes shaped during the Soviet period, will
experience the pressure for urbanization. The abandonment
and renaturalization of these areas also take place simultane-
ously. Figure 3 shows the main factors influencing the relicts of
the Soviet rural landscapes. This paradoxical situation of simul-
taneous abandonment and pressure for development and the
three of four major Lithuanian cities located in the landscapes
with predominant relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes demon-
strate the relevance of this research.
The Significance and Possible
Transformations of the Relicts of Soviet
Rural Landscape Under Influence of
Urbanization
The landscape itself has a multifunctional character; it per-
forms ecological function, aesthetic function, cultural­histori-
cal function, functions of tourism and information, and
functions of resources and land use (Rasa & Nikodemus,
2008). Bucas (1988) has distinguished three basic functions of
landscape in society's life: residential (sociobiological space
for human existence), production (area and resources for agri-
cultural production), and recreational (areas for rest of rural and
urban residents). Thus, analyzing the possibilities of develop-
ment of the relicts of the Soviet rural landscape in the areas of
rural­urban interface, all these functional and perceptual
aspects--sociocultural, economic, ecological, and aesthetic--
should be considered and none of them treated in isolation.
Sociocultural Aspects
From the ecological point of view, the cause of degradation of
the landscapes under consideration is the removal of wood-
lots and traditional green structures, the industrial farming
techniques, and the soil loss during the Soviet era. The agri-
cultural buildings may be seen as the secondary issue in this
problem. However, the buildings of the collective farms and
other agricultural complexes (piggeries, cowsheds, hatcher-
ies, silo storages, agrotechnical garage buildings, grain, fertil-
izer and pesticide storage buildings, grain elevators,
administrational buildings, etc.) are the most characteristic
objects that allow recognizing the relicts of the rural land-
scape of the Soviet period and cause different reactions of
professionals and society. The abandoned, derelict buildings
shape the image of such landscapes and may cause cultural
biases against such environments. Moreover, the Program of
Liquidation of Abandoned Buildings (State Protected Areas
Service Under the Ministry of the Environment, 2008) pre-
pared under the commission of the State Protected Areas
Service under the Ministry of the Environment of the Republic
of Lithuania indicates that inappropriately maintained or
abandoned buildings increase the social tensions and shape
the opinion that the authorities fail to properly manage the
country.
In the areas of rural­urban interface, where the density
of residents and the prices of land are higher than in the
average rural areas (Aleknavicius & Valciukien, 2011),
these buildings present particular functional and aesthetic
challenge. It is generally considered that the historic rural
buildings, such as the manor houses or homesteads, can be
used for tourism or adapted to the needs of communities.
However, the relicts of the Soviet period farming are the
ambiguous and contradictory legacy, which may be valued
more negatively than positively by the society both from
aesthetic and cultural­historical points of view. For exam-
ple, the survey carried out in Latvia has demonstrated that
the majority of the respondents saw the changes of coun-
try's landscape of the Soviet period and the subsequent
transformations as negative (Bell et al., 2008). The ques-
tions may be asked: Can contemporary society appreciate
the relics of the Soviet rural landscape with corresponding
buildings as cultural legacy, and how society would view
the reuse of abandoned farm buildings to other needs than
the agricultural production?
In the sociological survey (Rubikait, 2013), the members
of the society were asked to express their opinions about the
benefits of adaptive reuse, about cultural value of historic
agricultural buildings and the need to preserve them, and
about the emotional effects of abandoned farm buildings and
the possibilities to adapt them to the residential, commercial,
educational needs, and even to the function of public cater-
ing. Farmers were also asked about the possibilities of recon-
struction and reuse of such buildings.
The results show that the surveyed individuals seem to
view farm building reconstruction positively: 88% of the
respondents see the adaptive reuse as positive in general, and
62% of them agree that the abandoned agricultural com-
plexes in Lithuania can be successfully converted to different
nonagricultural functions. The answers concerning the
heritage value were much more ambiguous and reveal more
Figure 3. The factors influencing the relicts of the Soviet rural
landscapes.
6 SAGE Open
skeptical attitude toward the Soviet farm buildings: 65% of
the respondents agree that farm buildings of different histori-
cal periods may have historical, cultural, and aesthetic value;
however, 55% of the surveyed individuals agree that there
are many agricultural buildings that are not worth preserv-
ing. Only 18% of the respondents agreed that the agricultural
buildings of the Soviet period are worthy to preserve as cul-
tural heritage. The emotional impact of the abandoned agri-
cultural complexes on the respondents is mainly negative:
75% of the respondents stated that these buildings cause
negative emotions, 43% of the respondents noted that these
buildings negatively affect landscapes, and 32% noted that
the abandoned agricultural buildings negatively affect gen-
eral image of the country. The respondents were presented
with several examples of farm building adaptive reuse in dif-
ferent European countries. The answers show that the respon-
dents value positively different conversion possibilities:
conversion into residential building (59% view very posi-
tively, 25% view positively), conversion into hotel (45%
view very positively, 41% view positively), and conversion
into children and youth center (88% view positively). Eighty-
four percent of the respondents would use themselves and
recommend to other the children and youth center instituted
in the converted farm building. Twenty-two percent of the
respondents would consider living in a house or flat in a
reconstructed farm building, and 58 percent of the respon-
dents would consider this possibility only if the residential
unit would perfectly correspond to their needs. Seventy-two
percent of the respondents positively view the possibility to
adapt the abandoned farm buildings to leisure and entertain-
ment functions including catering. Ninety-one percent of the
respondents view reconstructed farm buildings as their pos-
sible working environment.
The surveyed farmers also do not reject the idea of
reconstruction of the existing abandoned agricultural
buildings; however, they view the idea of building reuse
for nonfarming purposes more skeptically. Only 12% of
them agreed that in cases when farming is impossible, the
agricultural buildings should be adapted to other functions.
The most appropriate nonagricultural functions for such
buildings according to the farmers would be commercial,
services, sports, administrative, and other special needs.
The surveys show that although the heritage value of agri-
cultural complexes raises the doubts in the society, their
reuse possibilities are viewed positively and a wide spec-
trum of socially acceptable new functions can be seen. The
lack of social infrastructure in peri-urban areas, the lack of
jobs, the lack of public spaces, the lack of identity, and the
lack of visual distinctiveness, on one hand, and the histori-
cal significance of the relicts of rural landscape of the
Soviet period, the higher density of residents in the influ-
ence zone of the city, and the higher potential for various
kinds of uses (Figure 4), on the other hand, demonstrate
the feasibility of both agricultural and nonagricultural uses
of these landscape relicts.
Economic Aspects
It is generally acknowledged that the adaptive reuse of aban-
doned buildings and territories can have a positive economic
influence as it diminishes the demolition costs, creates new
jobs in building reconstruction and repair and in other
directly and indirectly related sectors, and increases tax rev-
enue; recreated landscape complexes can be adapted to tour-
ism (Baltrusaityt, 2013). However, both the relicts of the
rural landscape of the Soviet period, especially buildings,
and the areas of rural­urban interface surrounding the largest
cities in Lithuania, including Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipeda,
have certain peculiarities that should be addressed in the con-
text of building and territory reuse.
The economic pressures for development in the zone of
influence of the city should be mentioned. For example, the
research byAleknavicius and Valciukien (2011) has demon-
strated the higher density of population and the higher prices
of agricultural land in the influence zone of Vilnius. They
had determined the radius of urban influence of 25 kilome-
ters. They have founded that in this territory surrounding
Vilnius, the density of residents is 10 times higher than in
average in the rural areas in Lithuania. The territories in this
zone are attractive for the real estate market, especially for
building individual houses and small residential quarters, for
commercial and logistics development. Thus, the research of
Aleknavicius and Valciukien demonstrates that the average
market price of agricultural land amounts to the average
price of residential land in the influence zone of Vilnius. The
analysis of land cover changes also demonstrates the con-
stant change in the zones of influence of large cities (Aplinkos
apsaugos agentra, 2014; Figure 5).
The administrational boundaries of Lithuanian cities also
comprise the open areas, natural, agricultural land, and the
fragments of historic rural landscape. The current territorial
planning documents--the city master plans and city district
master plans--do not envision the sustainable development
of peri-urban areas. According to Cirtautas (2012), these
municipalities often perceive the territory planning process

farming complex of the Soviet period at the fringe of Kaunas
(Lithuania) demonstrates the potential of such derelict objects.
Grazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 7
as the routine survey of the existing situation and the meeting
of the private interests instead of the complex decision mak-
ing having the long-term consequences. As it was mentioned
above, the relicts of the rural landscape of the Soviet period
are characterized by the vast open agricultural fields and
large building complexes. The open agricultural areas with-
out characteristic natural features are convenient and eco-
nomically efficient for planning and building the suburban
middle class housing. Thus, during the second decade of the
country's independence (Cirtautas, 2012), large parcels of
agricultural land surrounding the major cities were turned
into the territories for housing development. However, as the
present economic slowdown and general sociodemographic
trends of the country (Cereskevicius, 2012) suggest, the
development of housing in the peri-urban areas based solely
on the short-term economic interests may be detrimental not
only from ecological, social, and aesthetic but also from the
economic points of view.
The uniform houses monotonously arranged in the open
fields without any greenery or other distinctive features
together with the relatively large commuting distances and
the dependence on the automobile may not be so attractive
and affordable in the future. Meanwhile, the derelict farm
buildings and other equipment of the Soviet period constitute
an eyesore near newly developed residential areas (Figure 6).
Thus, not only the sociocultural but also the economic argu-
ment encourages thinking of the sustainable planning of the
areas of rural­urban interface and sustainable reuse of the
relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes.
Agriculture in the peri-urban zone. The pressures for develop-
ment of housing in the areas of rural­urban interface should
not overshadow the importance of agriculture in these areas.
According to Aleknavicius and Valciukien (2011), in the
zone of influence of the city of Vilnius, agricultural land con-
stitutes 51.3% of the total 29,869 hectares. This rate is very
similar to the average in the rural areas of the country, which
is 53.8%. According to them, in the zone of influence of
Kaunas city, residents keep even more livestock for 1 hectare
of agricultural land and more intensively cultivate horticul-
ture, potatoes, and vegetables than in the rest of the rural
Figure 5. Land cover changes, 2006-2013.

areas of the Kaunas district. Aleknavicius and Valciukien
underlined the possibilities to develop agriculture in the
zones of influence of the large Lithuanian cities and to spe-
cialize farms for producing the agricultural goods for the city
including fruits, berries, vegetables, milk, and poultry.
According to Aleknavicius and Valciukien (2011), the
percentage of the agricultural land in the zones of influence
of large cities will decrease because of urbanization and
afforestation and spontaneous renaturalization of agricultural
land; thus, the rest of agricultural land will be used more
rationally and intensively. This shows that some structural
elements of agricultural landscapes created during the Soviet
period can be maintained in the areas of rural­urban inter-
face simultaneously continuing their agricultural function
(Figure 7).
The results of the sociological survey of farmers carried
out by Rubikait (2013) also confirm this possibility. Forty-
one of 50 surveyed farmers still use the agricultural com-
plexes that were built during the Soviet period. The majority
of the surveyed farmers agreed that although new agricul-
tural complexes better correspond with animal welfare
requirements, provide better working environment, and look
more attractive, the reuse and reconstruction of agricultural
complexes of the Soviet period requite much less invest-
ments. Farmers value not only the buildings but also other
infrastructure including foundations and roads. The proxim-
ity of the city and contemporary trends of sustainability and
ecological lifestyles may also influence the agriculture in the
areas of rural­urban interface with the relicts of the Soviet
rural landscape. The trend of sustainable farming aimed at
producing locally for the city and minimizing the transporta-
tion costs, sometimes referred to as "bioregionalism" as a
part of much broader movement of "reconnecting the
socially-just human cultures in a sustainable manner to the
region-scale ecosystems in which they are irrevocably
embedded" (Aberley, 1999, p. 13) becomes increasingly
popular. Moreover, the large farm buildings of the Soviet
period can be reused for unusual farming activities: mush-
room growing, snails, earthworms'farms, harvesting of solar
energy on the rooftops. Peri-urban farms can also be visited
by the urban population for the educational purposes. A joint
form of peri-urban farming and agricultural tourism can be
developed.
Buildings. The state of the agricultural buildings of the Soviet
period is an important economic factor influencing the reuse
of the relicts of rural landscapes of this era. The common
characteristics of these buildings--simple utilitarian, func-
tional architectural form, large volumes, mundane white sili-
cate bricks and concrete, asbestos slate roof covers, rapid and
often hasty construction quality, and so on (Figures 8-10)--
determine that the buildings themselves have no particular
architectural or aesthetic values. Hypothetically, they can be
valued from the cultural point of view only as the parts of
their context--landscape--and as the reminders, witnesses
of the particular historical period. This means that the most
probably derelict and damaged agricultural buildings of the
Soviet period would not be restored or reconstructed because
of their cultural value. Consequently, the fate of these build-
ings is much more often determined by their economic value,
required expenditures and investments, usability (a way out
looking for affordable space for various commercial, manu-
facturing activities), and so on, than by the cultural aspects.
Thus, the physical state and function of these buildings are
very important for their future especially in the areas of
rural­urban interface. According to these, three categories of
the agricultural buildings of the Soviet period can be
distinguished:
Buildings with continuous agricultural use,visually and functionally
linked with the surrounding agricultural landscape.With con-
tinuous maintenance, repair, and minimal investments, the
physical state of these buildings can be maintained from sat-
isfactory to good (Figure 8). The maintenance costs of priva-
tized buildings usually fall on the shoulders of their owners.
Buildings reused for other purposes (sawmills,garages,small-scale
manufacturing, storage). The spontaneous processes of reuse
of the agricultural buildings of the Soviet period are espe-
cially visible in the zones of influence of the larger cities
with the greater concentration of economic activities. These
new functions do not mean the rapid improvement of the

physical state or aesthetic quality of these buildings and their
surroundings; reuse conditions only minimal repair and
maintenance of satisfactory physical state as these buildings
are viewed as an opportunity of cheap space not as valuable
objects themselves (Figure 9).
Abandoned buildings. As the Program of Liquidation of Aban-
doned Buildings indicates, the problem of abandoned build-
ings was raised only a decade ago in Lithuania, when it
became clear that many inappropriately privatized buildings
will not be used according to their function, their technical
state deteriorates rapidly (Figure 10), and derelict building
complexes raise the threats to country's residents and envi-
ronment. According to the data of the Informational System
of Derelict Buildings, 9,312 such buildings exist in the terri-
tory of the country (Figure 11), although this number is not
exact or final. The majority of these abandoned buildings
according to the Program are nonresidential buildings of the
Soviet period mainly related with the former collective
farms. These abandoned buildings can be classified accord-
ing to their physical state: the buildings of emergency state,
the buildings of satisfactory physical state, and the buildings
in good conditions.
The poor quality and absence of maintenance mean rapid
decay for the agricultural buildings of the Soviet period, and
many of those abandoned after the restoration of the inde-
pendence of the country are already in ruins. According to
the data of the Informational System of Derelict Buildings,
about 60% of the registered abandoned buildings should be
demolished, the others can be repaired or reused. The liqui-
dation of these buildings also involves the economic costs
calculated in the Program of Liquidation of Abandoned
Buildings (State Protected Areas Service Under the Ministry
of the Environment, 2008). Thus, this group of the agricul-
tural buildings of the Soviet period constitutes the major
challenge: The specific ways of their liquidation or reuse in
the context of rural­urban interface should be developed.
Ecological and Aesthetic Aspects
Aesthetics and ecology are strongly interlined in landscapes
and should not be dealt with separately. The interdisciplinary
attempts to analyze the links between the ecology, aesthetics,
and even artistic creation engendered the discipline of eco-
aesthetics (Araeen, 2009). At the first glance, the ecological
and aesthetic states of landscapes directly correlate. For
example, maintaining the valuable plants would have the

high aesthetical potential, not only the ecological one
(Jankevica, 2012); the less ecologically viable and diverse
landscape should be less aesthetically pleasing as well. Many
practical examples of direct links between the ecology and
aesthetics can be seen in the Lithuanian landscape. For
example, analyzing the aesthetic potential of Lithuanian
landscape, Kavaliauskas (2011) indicated that the agricul-
tural plains, which constitute more than a half (51.3%) of the
country's landscape, were acknowledged by the Lithuanian
landscape researchers Budrinas and ringis as having the
lowest aesthetic value. The harmony between the high aes-
thetic quality of environment and its ecological health is
desirable for cultural landscapes. Nevertheless, the ecologi-
cal health and balance are not always associated with the
high aesthetic quality: The ecologically healthy landscapes
maynotbeaestheticallypleasingandviceversa(Kucinskien,
2009). The close interrelations in landscapes between the
anthropogenic elements, such as architectural and urban
structures, which require constant maintenance, and the nat-
ural elements, which flourish undisturbed by the human
activities, create the ecoaesthetic complexities, which can be
seen in the former Soviet rural landscapes. The two main
directions of changes of the rural landscape of Soviet period
after the restoration of the independence can be distin-
guished: In the less fertile and difficult to access marshy or
hilly terrains, the process of renaturalization is leading to the
formation of woody and scrubby areas, and abandoned farm
buildings (Figure 12) negatively affect the local identity; in
the fertile plains, the large and strong farms are intensively
exploiting the territorial resources, thus diminishing the bio-
diversity and recreational potential.
In the areas of the rural­urban interface, the links between
the aesthetics and ecology related to the relicts of the Soviet
rural landscape become even more complicated: These
landscapes are affected by such contradictory trends as
abandonment, the decline of buildings of rural origination,
the renaturalization of the abandoned agricultural areas, the
fragmentation of natural and agricultural land, the intensive
cultivation, the new construction, the radical changes of
functions, and the advent of suburban and urban aesthetics.
The ecological­aesthetic congruencies and contradictions in
the relicts of the Soviet rural landscape under the influence
of urbanization are shortly described below:
Ecological priority.As the nature reclaims the abandoned agri-
cultural land, the ecological viability and diversity increase.
The natural ecosystems in urbanized, densely inhabited
environment though are desirable from the point of view of
environmental sustainability (Jorgensen, 2011); however,
according to the opinion of some researchers (Nassauer, 1995),
they create the sense of abandonment and unsafety. According
to Nassauer (1995), many natural ecosystems do not corre-
spond to the aesthetic norms prevalent in the society. In the
case of the former Soviet agricultural landscape, this abandon-
ment happens on the large scale. Large derelict farm buildings
also contribute to the negative image of these areas in the vicin-
ity of the city. However, as the contemporary research on the
links of ecology and aesthetics demonstrates, these abandoned
succession landscapes at the urban fringe or even in the inner
urban areas can have the specific aesthetic value and some-
times can even be the desirable elements of environment and
the sites of discovery and experimentation (Gandy, 2013; Nohl,
2001). These landscapes can be viewed as a part of the process
of the increasing heteropolitanization--transition toward the
socially, economically, culturally, and spatially more heteroge-
neous and complex environments (Gentile et al., 2012)--of
postcommunist urban environment.
Agricultural priority.The features of the former Soviet rural
landscape provide the possibilities for the intensive large-
scale agriculture. Intensively cultivated productive agricul-
tural landscapes have certain aesthetics (Nohl, 2001),
although land cultivation and especially monoculture cause
the ecological decline and the contrasts of the features of the
urban, suburban, and agricultural aesthetics in the areas of
rural­urban interface (Figure 13).

Aesthetic fragmentation and chaotic diversity. Due to the eco-
nomic pressures and the intensive development, the features
of agricultural landscape are being increasingly erased in the
areas, where the urban influence is mostly felt (Figure 14).
The large regular open areas of the former Soviet rural land-
scape provide the possibilities for the unrestrained develop-
ment of residential, commercial, logistics structures and the
necessary infrastructure. With the lack of coordination of this
process, the dissonant, fragmented landscapes having both
rural and urban features, which became a stereotype of sub-
urban landscape, emerge. Here, many processes happen in
the close proximity and create the aesthetic confusion. This
type of rural­urban interface landscape also requires the spe-
cific attention.
Integration Scenarios
The landscape as the dynamic holistic phenomenon (Antrop,
2008) and the sociocultural, economic, ecological, and aes-
thetic aspects related to the reuse of the relicts of the Soviet
rural landscape in the areas of rural­urban interface imply the
systematic, integrated approach to this problem. The Soviet
utilitarian planning and management of the rural landscapes
had made the landscapes unattractive for numerous modern
uses related with the urban development--residential, cul-
tural, recreation, small business development, and so on. The
question may be raised how these landscapes can be adapted
to more economically and ecologically sustainable life in the
developing rural­urban interface areas and how it is possible
avoiding further visual and ecological degradation of these
landscapes. According to Bucas (2001), such cultural land-
scapes should be aesthetically attractive, ergonomic, ecologi-
cally sustainable, and spiritually meaningful. Historical rural
landscapes usually were and are the organically evolved cul-
tural landscapes (Bucas, 2001; United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], World
Heritage Center, 2013). These landscapes had resulted from
an initial social, economic, administrative, and/or religious
imperative and developed their present form by association
with and in response to natural environment; such landscapes
reflect that process of evolution in their form and component
features (UNESCO, World Heritage Center, 2013). The agri-
cultural reform of the Soviet period, the urban expansion, and
its influence on the rural landscapes afterward had disrupted
the continuous evolution of these landscapes under analysis.
With the increasing pressures for development, the urban
influence, numerous stakeholders, and the conflicting inter-
ests and functions, the organic evolution of landscapes in the
areas of rural­urban interface is hardly possible. However,
the holistic, integrated planning and design process encom-
passing the different scales of landscape from garden to
region, from small neighborhood to the entire metropolitan
area (Spirn, 2000), viewing the landscape design as a tool for
sustainability, viewing the landscape architecture as the
instrument of environmentalism (McHarg, 1969), taking into
account the social, economic, ecological, aesthetic dimen-
sions, and the overall image of the landscapes all these men-
tioned aspects could foster the conscious development of
cultural landscapes. Insightful planning and artistic thinking
can be used to stimulate the organic landscape evolution pro-
cess and to transfer it to a new level as well (Araeen, 2009).
The idea of McHarg that landscape design is a tool for human
evolution (Spirn, 2000) can be integrated here as well.
According to Antrop (2008), the landscape research
should focus more on prognosis and scenarios. He notes that
much landscape research is descriptive; it contributes mainly
to knowledge but rarely serves as the basis for planning the
future development. Thus, the scenario approach was
selected as a tool to coordinate all the above-mentioned
aspects and create desirable landscape quality and image.

icts of Soviet rural landscape in the areas of rural­urban
interface. The table includes the following:

reflect the desirable image of each envisioned

·
· the possibilities to develop the types of sustainable
landscape with corresponding aesthetic character dis-
tinguished by Nohl (2001). We find the contribution
of Nohl particularly interesting and relevant for this
research. His holistic approach toward aesthetics in
the context of landscape sustainability and the look at
the future landscapes as the aesthetical objects and his
four aesthetic perceptual categories under the sustain-
able landscape conditions can be successfully applied
in the development of the relicts of Soviet rural land-
scapes under the pressures of urbanization. These four
landscape types or the aesthetic perceptual categories
under sustainable landscape conditions include "the
beautiful" (areas similar to traditional cultural land-
scapes), "the new sublime" (areas where nature can
develop freely and spontaneously, such parts of land-
scape simultaneously can be disharmonic, unordered,
fragmented, unstable, not easy to read, mysterious,
and very informative and aesthetically appealing),
"the interesting" (areas where the multiplicity of land
uses generate confusing, incoherent, labyrinthine,
chaotic environments and events; however, the inter-
esting in the right place affects us positively even if it
includes ugly things), and "the plain" (areas of eco-
logically sound intensive agricultural production--
rural functional landscapes).
Scenario 1--Renaturalized Landscapes
The scenario involves the demolition of abandoned agricul-
tural buildings of the Soviet era and related infrastructure,
the renaturalization of derelict agricultural areas, and the rec-
reation of the image of natural landscape. The term "renatu-
ralization" here implies the naturalness of landscape, the
return to its primeval state (Balevicit & Veteikis, 2013).
This scenario would apply to the areas unsuitable for any
kind of intensive development and even more to the ecologi-
cally valuable and vulnerable areas that could be left unde-
veloped for renaturalization, eco-compensation, increase of
biodiversity, acting as carbon sinks, as an integral part of
ecological corridors, and so on. The proximity of urban envi-
ronment would also give the educational and recreational
dimension to these landscapes: They can stimulate the sensi-
bility toward nature, willingness to explore.
Scenario 2--Succession Landscapes
This scenario involves leaving the landscapes with the relicts
of the Soviet era for spontaneous renaturalization. Only the
hazardous buildings and structures can be dismantled, while
covering other abandoned buildings and their ruins with rap-
idly growing trees and shrubs or using vertical planting. The
relicts of agricultural buildings can be adapted to the envi-
ronmental protection needs (for bat hibernation, etc.) as well.
This scenario involves "the design with nature" (McHarg,
1969) and always with the minimum possible interventions
and the minimum envisioned further maintenance costs bear-
ing in mind the disputed values of the relicts of the Soviet
rural landscape and buildings and their scale and the scarcity
of funds. As this scenario--leaving landscape to succes-
sional processes--requires the least cost, it could be applied
both in the larger as smaller scales: in the areas unsuitable for
any kind of intensive development or in some segments of
agricultural, recreational, or other kind of peri-urban areas.
Even if this kind of landscape does not generate any kind of
direct economic use, it may provide numerous indirect ben-
efits for urban ecology (eco-compensation, increase of biodi-
versity, acting as carbon sinks, serving as a part of ecological
corridors, etc.) and society (an engagement with the indepen-
dent agency of nature, according to Gandy, 2013; demonstra-
tion of succession landscape to urban society; specific form
of recreation). Even if such "derelict" landscapes may seem
unsuitable in the close proximity of urban areas or even in
the inner urban areas, contemporary researchers increasingly
underline its importance. For example, Gandy (2013) speak-
ing on aesthetics, ecology, and urban wastelands used such
concepts as "urban nature" and "urban biodiversity" relevant
for the analysis of rural­urban interface; he noted that
the marginal spaces of Berlin, London, Montreal, and other
cities were becoming a significant focus for cultural and
scientific attention that reflected a series of developments such
as the emergence of new art practices, increasing levels of
ecological awareness, and the changing characteristics of cities
themselves. (pp. 1301-1302)
Nohl (2001) distinguished such kind of landscapes for the
"self-dynamics, self-productivity, and self-regulation of
nature" as the "landscape areas, which are taken away from
the control of man, at least temporarily." In this case, the
ecology can be not only a science, a moral obligation, but the
norm of beauty as well (McHarg, 1969; Spirn, 2000).
Scenario 3--Unusual Landscapes
This scenario aims at creating new types of rural­urban
interface landscapes, unusual, interesting (Nohl, 2001) land-
scapes, and involves the renaturalization or leaving to suc-
cessional processes of derelict agricultural areas. It involves
the reconstruction and adaptation of agricultural buildings of
the Soviet era to nontraditional agricultural (growing snails,
Grazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 15
earthworms, mushrooms, etc.) or nonagricultural (sun-
harvesting, small businesses, manufacturing) uses as well.
The basic conditions for development of such unusual land-
scapes in the areas of rural­urban interface would involve
difficult accessibility, high ecological importance of the area
under consideration or its unsuitability for agriculture, and
good or satisfactory state of the existing buildings. The
development of such landscapes can involve not only utili-
tarian and ecological developments but also the artistic cre-
ations. The idea of landscape as a collective work of art by
Araeen (2009) could be useful in this regard. Araeen
expanded the concept of the land art, which could be seen not
merely as a conceptual art object, but can become an ongoing
and self-sustaining dynamic process, a movement generated
within it. The role of artistic imagination in this case is
to think, initiate and create not what is self-consumed by the ego
from which the idea emerges, but what can transcend and
transgress the narcissistic ego and become part of the collective
energy of the earth. It can then transform it in ways that enhance
not only the natural potential of the earth itself but also the
collective creativity of the life of all its inhabitants. (p. 684)
If realized successfully, such landscapes of unexpected
combinations (Figure 15) can attract considerable public
interest as well, and the concept of "interesting" by Nohl
(2001) can be applied here as in these landscapes, "the aes-
thetic need for information may be satisfied quickly and
thoroughly" (p. 232).
Scenario 4--Agricultural Functional Landscapes
The scenario involves the sustainable agricultural use of the
territories of the relicts of Soviet rural landscape, renovation
if necessary, and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure
for agricultural use. This scenario is the most feasible in the
areas more distant from the city and the main transport
routes, where the majority of population still works in agri-
cultural sector and where the conditions are favorable for
farming. However, with the rise of local produce and the
trend of bioregionalism (Aberley, 1999), farming and the
proximity of urban environment may not be mutually exclu-
sive and can even constitute an advantage. Moreover, accord-
ing to Nohl (2001, p. 233), these productive landscapes, if
sustainably cultivated and ecologically improved, can have
their own aesthetics called "the plain" and "able to arouse
feelings of contentment and gratitude in the beholder," "to
show how nature and the man-made could be reconciled."
Scenario 5--Recreational Landscapes
This scenario involves the transformation of the relicts of
abandoned agricultural territories of the Soviet period into the
recreational areas. It also involves the reconstruction of aban-
doned buildings, and their adaptation to social, cultural, or
other uses of local communities. One of the significant factors
determining the reuse possibilities of the relicts of Soviet
rural landscapes is their accessibility. The relics of the Soviet
rural landscape and the extant buildings of good or satisfac-
tory physical state located in the zones of strong urban influ-
ence and near the main transport routes can be converted to
other nonagricultural functions. In the peri-urban areas with
higher population density, these buildings and areas can be
adapted for the social, cultural needs and recreation bearing in
mind the current lack of cultural function and public spaces in
the developing zones of rural­urban interface in Lithuania. In
the cases when the areas are easily accessible and not favor-
able for cultivation, peri-urban recreation complexes serving
for the urban population could be developed. Development of
such recreational landscapes could be based both on the
previously mentioned concept "the interesting"--creating
unusual landscapes for rest and exploration--and "the beauti-
ful" distinguished by Nohl (2001) or their combinations.
"The beautiful" in the case of contemporary landscape devel-
opment refers to the areas where "all the elements are more or
less known and in which they are arranged in a balanced and
harmonic that is in a beautiful order" (Nohl, 2001, p. 231).
This concept could be well applicable in the cases when the
Figure 15. Unexpected combinations of tidy peri-urban
aesthetics and renaturalization at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).
Figure 16. The relicts of rural landscape of different historic
periods and different values at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).
16 SAGE Open
relicts of other, more sustainable and harmonic types of his-
toric rural landscape--ikivalakinis, valakinis, or vienkiemi-
nis--and/or the distinctive features of natural environment
are present in the territory (Figure 16).
Scenario 6--Urban Fringe Landscapes
This scenario involves the urbanization of abandoned agri-
cultural territories and adaptation of abandoned agricultural
buildings of the Soviet period to cultural, social, or economic
needs. According to I. McHarg (1969), the uncontrolled
growth is inevitably destructive, and the planned growth is
more desirable and as profitable as the uncontrolled growth.
This assertion is especially relevant to the areas of rural­
urban interface. Multifunctionality and the polycentric
development become increasingly important in the areas of
rural­urban interface as a means to reduce the dependency
on automobile by creating jobs and providing services and
social infrastructure locally and to enhance local identity
and to strengthen communities. The abandoned buildings
and territories could be used for the social needs and services
of local communities and for commerce and production, thus
diversifying local economies and reducing the need to com-
mute.According toAntuchevicien (2005), the buildings and
territories near densely inhabited areas could be adapted to
the businesses and industries, which require more work-
forces. The structural and aesthetic features of farm build-
ings of the Soviet period strongly limit the possibility to
adapt them to residential purposes; however, not only the
foreign experience (Lunkevicius, 2001) but also the survey
results (Rubikait, 2013) demonstrate that this possibility
should not be rejected totally. This scenario can as well
involve the combinations of "the beautiful" and "the interest-
ing" according to Nohl (2001), where the development of
peri-urban residential areas could be based on the balance
and harmony characteristic to the traditional cultural land-
scapes, and the reused agricultural buildings of the Soviet era
may constitute "the interesting" element and contribute to
the specific identity and legibility of the local landscape.
Scenario 7--Urban Landscapes
The last scenario involves the complete redevelopment of
the territory, without leaving any explicit signs of its past: the
urbanization of abandoned agricultural territories and the
demolition of abandoned agricultural buildings. This sce-
nario would be feasible in the case, when the territory under
consideration is easily accessible or it has the high economic
and social importance, and the state of extant buildings and
other structures of the Soviet era is bad or emergency. In such
cases, the large spaces provided by the rural landscapes of
the Soviet period provide the possibilities for unrestricted
development of urban environment, where different aesthetic
concepts ("the beautiful," "the interesting"; Nohl, 2001) and
urban solutions can be selected. However, it is important that
these new landscapes would correspond to the characteristics
of cultural landscapes--aesthetical attractiveness, ergonom-
ics, ecological sustainability, and spiritual meaningfulness
(Bucas, 2001)--and would provide real home for peri-urban
residents.
Conclusion
This research has focused on the landscapes in the rapidly
changing social and economic conditions and particularly on
the features, development, and redevelopment possibilities
of the relicts of Soviet rural landscapes in the areas of rural­
urban interface in postcommunist Lithuania.
The short review of history and the peculiarities of these
landscapes have demonstrated that the reforms of the Soviet
period had strongly altered the Lithuanian landscape. As a
consequence of these changes, the specific type of rural land-
scapes, which can be characterized by the industrial scale of
interventions and production, the restructured and rational-
ized rural settlement system, the radically new building and
planting practices and with the large, regular, and uniform
spaces and agricultural production complexes of unusual
shapes, materials, and large volumes, and the related infra-
structure, had emerged. After the restoration of the indepen-
dence of the country, the following restructuring of
agricultural economy affected not only the country's society
but also the landscape: Numerous agricultural areas with cor-
responding building complexes and other structures mainly
of the Soviet period lay abandoned, the decline of the build-
ings is accompanied by the processes of renaturalization of
agricultural land, simultaneously new small farms and large
agricultural enterprises emerge causing further landscape
transformations, and rapid and extensive urban expansion in
the zone of influence of large cities into natural and rural ter-
ritories alter the face of the Lithuanian rural areas and their
links with urban environment.
This paradoxical combination of the rapid new develop-
ments and renaturalization and successional processes in
landscape deserves a special attention and the analysis of
their social, cultural, economic, ecological, and aesthetic
dimensions. The literature review and survey results reveal
the sociocultural and economic premises for the different
uses of the relics of the rural landscape of Soviet period in
the areas of rural­urban interface ranging from the restora-
tion of natural landscape to continuity of agricultural prac-
tices and the use for recreational and social purposes. The
relicts of the rural landscapes of the Soviet period affected by
the contemporary urbanization present the particular chal-
lenge from the point of view of interaction of ecology and
aesthetics as well. These landscapes exhibit such contradic-
tory trends as abandonment, decline of buildings, renatural-
ization, intensive urbanization, fragmentation, contrasts of
rural and urban aesthetics, and so on, and simultaneously
hold the potential of realization of new aesthetic concepts of
"urban nature" (Gandy, 2013). This complexity demonstrates
Grazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 17
the need of new approaches toward the development of cul-
tural landscapes.
The approach of landscape development scenarios with
the specific landscape aesthetic expressions based mainly on
the findings of Nohl (2001) and with reference to Gandy
(2013) was selected. We argue that such approach would be
helpful for development of the sustainable landscapes in the
areas of rural­urban interface--the new aesthetically attrac-
tive, ergonomic, ecologically sustainable, and spiritually
meaningful (Bucas, 2001) cultural landscapes. This contribu-
tion demonstrates the applicability of the Nohl's ideas to spe-
cific contexts as well. Seven scenarios of treatment of these
landscape relicts in the areas of rural­urban interface under
different conditions and reflecting the gradual transition from
the natural and rural to the urban were developed: renatural-
ized landscapes (recreation of the image of natural landscape),
succession landscapes (leaving landscapes for spontaneous
renaturalization simultaneously maintaining some signs of
their previous use), unusual landscapes (creating interesting,
unusual, new types of landscape in the vicinity of the city),
agricultural functional landscapes (developing/maintaining
agricultural landscapes in the vicinity of the city), recreational
landscapes (development of unusual recreational settings for
urban population), urban fringe landscapes (developing inter-
esting and humane peri-urban environment with focal points
for communities, specific characters, and the reminders of the
place's history), and urban landscapes (developing high-qual-
ity urban environment). The scenarios demonstrate the pos-
sibilities to develop multifunctional, polycentric peri-urban
areas; to develop agriculture and produce locally for the city;
and to develop natural areas for eco-compensation and recre-
ational sites.
