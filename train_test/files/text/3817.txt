Abstract: Constructivist pedagogy draws on Piaget's developmental theory.
Because Piaget depicted the emergence of formal reasoning skills in adolescence
as part of the normal developmental pattern, many constructivists have assumed
that intrinsic motivation is possible for all academic tasks. This paper argues that
Piaget's concept of a formal operational stage has not been empirically verified
and that the cognitive skills associated with that stage are in fact "biologically
secondary abilities" (Geary and Bjorklund, 2000) culturally determined abilities
that are difficult to acquire. Thus, it is unreasonable to expect that intrinsic
motivation will suffice for most students for most higher level academic tasks.
In addition, a case is made that educational psychology must incorporate the
insights of evolutionary psychology.
Keywords: Piaget, developmental theory, formal operational stage, evolutionary

Piaget in the Light of Evolutionary Psychology
Of course the most fruitful, most obvious field of study would be
reconstituting human history ­ the history of human thinking in prehistoric
man. Unfortunately, we are not very well informed about the psychology of
Neanderthal man or about the psychology of Homo siniensis of Teilhard de
Chardin. Since this field of biogenesis is not available to us, we shall do as
biologists do and turn to ontogenesis (Piaget, 1970, p. 13).
Textbooks on child development and educational psychology often take Piaget
as the starting point for discussing cognitive development (e.g. Ormrod, 2003).
Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
This is a very reasonable tack because Piaget, more than any other theorist,
shaped our understanding of how children's cognition changes in predictable
ways. Central to Piaget is the idea that children are able to solve certain problems
only at certain ages and that these problems can be organized into a
developmental sequence that defines discrete stages of cognitive development.
Piaget was clearly extending a notion borrowed from Binet (early in his career
Piaget had been employed standardizing intelligence tests, Vidal, 1994), but while
Binet focused on individual differences, Piaget found significance in children's
similarities (Hoffman, 1982).
Piaget's approach has proved remarkably fruitful. For example, it is now well
documented that children across cultures accomplish certain Piagetian tasks
approximately at the ages and in the sequence predicted (Brainerd, 1978; De
Lemos, 1969). Indeed, some aspects of the Piaget model are so universal that they
extend beyond the human species. There is evidence of Piaget like developmental
milestones in a number of mammalian species (Parker and McKinney; 1999,
Langer, 1998; Dore and Goulet, 1998; Gruber, Girgus, and Banuazizi, 1971) and
Piagetian influenced research has become important in ethology (Vauclair, 1996;
Parker and McKinney, 1999; Pepperberg, 2002). Another line of research has
linked Piagetian tasks to the developmental changes in the brain (e.g. Diamond,
1991).
Yet for all its success, several important elements of Piaget's work have not
stood up to empirical scrutiny. There is now abundant evidence that Piaget
underestimated the capacities of infants (Ormrod, 2003). Many neo-Piagetians
now reject his notion of an overarching logical-mathematical structure as the
driving force of development and now think in terms of independent cognitive
structures regulated by a generalized developmental capacity (Case, 1992;
Pascual-Leone, 1987). In addition, Piaget's model of unified stages, while a
convenient heuristic, does not always capture the combined and uneven
development of children's cognition (Siegler, 1996; Kuhn, 1988; Hoffman, 1982).
Perhaps, his greatest failure was his characterization of the formal operations
stage, said to begin in adolescence. It is now abundantly clear that many
teenagers and adults do not reason in the ways described by Piaget.
The goal of this paper is to discuss this latter problem with Piaget's work in
light of evolutionary psychology. It is argued here not simply that Piaget's model
must be modified to incorporate the insights of evolutionary psychology, but that
developmental theory should be subsumed into evolutionary psychology. More
over, a case is made that absent the insights of evolutionary psychology, Piagetian
constructivist pedagogy is fundamentally flawed.
It may surprise some to learn that Piaget was deeply committed to an
evolutionary view of cognitive development. Textbooks are often silent on this
point (e.g. Feldman, 1998) and one has the sense that Piaget has been
"debiologized" for presentation to publics not open to biological and evolutionary

explanations (although it should be noted there are many excellent exceptions to
this phenomenon, e.g. Cole and Cole, 1989).
The notion that evolutionary psychology is the proper framework for continued
evaluation of Piaget is perfectly natural. As the epigram for this paper suggests
Piaget (1976/1978) himself was motivated by a conviction that cognitive
development could only be understood as part of a larger evolutionary model.
The limits of Piaget could even be said to reflect the limits of the evolutionary
model he embraced. Piaget, while a committed evolutionist, was not a Darwinian
and he was deeply influenced by teleological and recapitulationist points of view
(Gould, 1977; Messerly, 1996). He saw cognitive evolution as reaching for some
kind of telos, a view that is impossible to make consistent with modern
evolutionary theory (Williams, 1966; Dawkins, 1986). Evolutionary processes
cannot be shaped by some distal endpoint. Rather brains evolve to solve proximal
environmental and social challenges. Modern evolutionary psychology suggests
that the best understanding of the mind will arise from study of our species'
Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness. Defined by Symons (1992) as "the
Pleistocene environment in which the overwhelming majority of human evolution
occurred" (p. 143). The structure and development of human cognitive abilities,
like all products of selection, can only be fully understood in the context of
natural history.
The strength of this approach can be seen in Cummins' (1998) work on deontic
reasoning. Cummins notes that humans are particularly good at deontic
reasoning, that is reasoning about obligations and rights, because our minds have
adapted to negotiate the uncertainties of dominance hierarchy. Cummins observes
that "children as young as three years of age organize themselves into dominance
hierarchies" (p. 45). Research by Edelman and Omark (1973) not only documents
the existence of dominance hierarchies in young children, but links the
development of these hierarchies to the child's attainment of the ability to seriate,
to rank order objects along some dimension. It was Piaget (1941/1965) who first
discussed the ability to seriate as a developmental phenomenon. Because Piaget
was unclear on the underlying evolutionary context of cognitive development
(although he fully acknowledged that it existed) he limited the explanatory power
of his model. Using an evolutionary approach Edelman and Omark were able to
see connections that eluded Piaget, in this case "the logical equivalence of
seriation and hierarchization" (p. 108).
Formal Operations
Kuhn (1979) has argued, "that Piaget's stage of formal operations is the single
stage in his sequence having the most profound and far reading implications for
education" (p. 34). The stage was first described by Inhelder and Piaget in 1958.
The formal operational abilities include prepositional logic, inductive logic,
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 129
Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
hypothesis testing, and reasoning about proportions, combinations, probabilities,
and correlations.
The name for the formal operations stage comes from the belief that younger
children cannot disregard the content of an argument and pay attention to its
formal structure. Phillips (1969) gives this example of a syllogism
All children like spinach;
Boys are children
Therefore boys like spinach (p. 103)
He goes on to note that "the younger child will respond to the context
(particularly if he is a boy who doesn't like spinach!), but the adolescent can
follow the argument because he is impressed by its form" (p. 103). But in a
footnote, Phillips mentions a 1944 study by Morgan and Morton where most
college students could not distinguish between the form and content of a
syllogism. Morgan and Morton found "that even when a subject is presented with
a syllogism in which the terms are abstract symbols or concrete terms which have
little or no personal significance, he has difficulty in selecting the correct
conclusion" (p. 39). When the content was personally significant they found that
distortion becomes much more marked when the terms in the syllogism are
related to the personal convictions of the reasoner. A person is likely to
accept a conclusion which expresses his convictions with little regard for
the correctness or incompleteness of the inference involved (p. 39).
Thus, contrary to Piaget's predictions, not only were adults not able to separate
form from content, they had difficulty with syllogistic reasoning itself. This
observation is consistent with experimental results that show that humans have
great difficulty solving normative deductive reasoning problems (Evens, 2002;
Stanovich and West, 2000).
Tamburrini (1982) pointed out that "there is considerable evidence that formal
operational thought is contextually bound" (p. 319). This is no small concession;
the very point of formal operations is that they go beyond context and content.
The failure of adolescents and adults to reason in the ways predicted by Piaget is a
serious problem for both the theory and practice of education, for it is precisely
the formal reasoning skills that are necessary for mastering academic subjects
such as math and science beyond the elementary level.
The literature abounds with evidence that adolescents and adults fail to exhibit
the type of reasoning predicted by Piaget. This failure can be found in both
academic and non-academic contexts. Capon and Kuhn (1982) in a study of
supermarket shoppers found that most could not apply the formal operational skill
of proportional reasoning to calculate best buys. They concluded formal

Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
operations "appears to be the only stage in Piaget's sequence that is not attained
universally" (p. 449).
Evolutionary psychology, on the other hand, does give us a framework for
understanding the frequent failure of adolescents and adults to use formal
reasoning and master certain academic tasks. Geary (1995) makes a distinction
between biologically primary abilities and biologically secondary abilities.
Biologically primary abilities refer to those cognitive skills, such as learning
language, which are the result of the evolved architecture of the brain (Geary,
1995, 2002). Geary and Bjorklund (2000) note that
Biologically primary abilities are acquired universally and children
typically have high motivation to perform the tasks involving them. In
contrast, biologically secondary abilities are culturally determined, and
often tedious repetition and external motivation are necessary for their
mastery. From this perspective it is understandable that many children have
difficulty with reading and higher mathematics (p. 63).
It is important to note that this is not a simple model of biological base and
cultural superstructure. Rather as Geary (1995) points out biological secondary
abilities entail "the co-optation of primary abilities for purposes other than the
original evolution-based function and appear to develop only in specific cultural
context" (p. 24).
Using this framework we are now in a position to reinterpret Piaget's
contribution. We can understand the Piagetian tasks (at least those that have been
empirically verified) that characterize the first 11 years of life as rooted in the
biologically primary abilities. For example, Parker and McKinney (1999) in their
extensive review of primate cognitive development found that
First, macaques, cebus, great apes, and humans transverse the same
sequence of stages in the development of logical as well as physical
cognition during the sensorimotor period.
Second, both great apes and humans complete all the sensorimotor period
stages in logical as well as physical cognition, but macaques and cebus
monkeys do not (p. 104)
The sensorimotor period was the first of Piaget's developmental stages that
occurs in humans between the ages of birth and two years. In addition, Parker
and McKinney found evidence "that great apes may achieve the level of intuitive
subperiod of preoperations in the logical-mathematical domains of seriation,
classification, conservation, and number" (p. 105). All this suggests a deep
phylogenetic history for the ability to perform many of the Piaget tasks and
suggests that many are biologically primary abilities. Formal operational tasks, on

Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
the other hand, should, like reading, be regarded as biologically secondary
abilities. Formal operational skills should not be thought of as skills that naturally
unfold over the course of development, instead these are skills that are acquired
with considerable effort and often require instruction.
This distinction between biologically primary abilities and biologically
secondary abilities allows us to explain results obtained by Goodnow and Bethon
(1966). These researchers combined data on schooled and unschooled children in
Hong Kong and schooled children in the United States and discovered that "lack
of schooling does not upset the conservation of weight, volume, or surface but
does upset a task of combinatorial reasoning" (p. 573). It appears that solving the
conservation tasks, the hallmark of Piaget's concrete operational stage, relies on
biologically primary abilities while the combinatorial task is more related to
biologically secondary abilities. Kuhn (1979) in her review of the educational
implications of formal operations implicitly recognizes this type of distinction:
Evidence of the lack of universality in the attainment of a formal
operational level of cognitive development suggests that there may be an
important potential role for education to play in this attainment. This is a
role that is absent in the case of the earlier stages in Piaget's sequence,
given the research evidence that all individuals within the normal range of
intelligence attain the stage of concrete operations loses its force as a
meaningful curriculum objective: and a look at the history of Piaget-based
early childhood programs reveals that their curriculum objectives quite
rapidly turned away from the teaching of concrete operations and toward
other, quite different utilizations of Piaget's theory in an educational context
(p. 47).
Although using a different vocabulary, Kuhn's conclusion is remarkably
similar to Geary's and Bjorklund's. Put more simply, many higher-level skills do
not come to most of us easily or naturally, rather they must be conquered through
a process of schooling.
The distinction between biologically primary and biologically secondary
abilities has important educational consequences. Constructivism is a popular
educational theory that traces its roots to Piaget (DeVries and Kohlberg, 1987;
Pulaski, 1971). Iran-Nejad (2001) provides us with a useful synopsis of the
constructivist viewpoint:
Classroom "learning" is unnatural and something that does not occur in the
early years of life when a child learns a language, and something most
adults avoid after they have escaped formal education. The implication of
constructivism, and of our elaborations on it, are to argue that children must
have access to the same natural learning processes they employ before they

Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
enter school, and later, outside traditional classroom environments where
interest and dynamic functions operate. In the unnatural classroom
environment this does not occur (p. 24).
By failing to distinguish between biologically primary and biologically
secondary abilities, Iran-Nejad deduces that because children acquire some skills
easily with little instruction they can acquire all skills that way. Because
constructivists assume that all learning unfolds as part of the developmental
process they often endorse student-centered approaches to education at all levels,
assume that intrinsic motivation is always possible, and downplay the importance
of acquiring a knowledge base. For example, Iran-Nejad (2001) calls for
classroom activities that:
permit multiple sources of control to interact with the natural learning
process that create knowledge. Attention must be directed and controlled by
the individual, as an outgrowth of interest and problem-solving behavior,
not controlled by the environment and forced by the teacher. Curiosity
must be stimulated for intrinsic learning (p. 27).
Similarly Pulaski (1971) asserts
Piaget has shown us, in his thorough and painstaking studies of the child,
that verbal understanding is superficial and "deforming"; learning, whether
for children or their teachers, comes only through the subject's own activity.
The ability and eagerness to learn, which is part of every child's birthright,
is our greatest educational resource (p. 205).
While no educator would disparage the importance of intrinsic motivation, there
is ample evidence that for most students for most academic tasks, intrinsic
motivation is insufficient (Steinberg, 1996; Hirsch, 1996; Chall, 2000). The
Rousseauian view that Piaget's work is often used to justify contrasts sharply with
the evolutionary perspective taken by Pinker (2002):
Education is neither writing on a blank slate nor allowing the child's
nobility to come into flower. Rather, education is a technology that tries to
make up for what the human mind is innately bad at. Children don't have
to go to school to learn to walk, talk recognize objects, or remember the
personalities of their friends, even though these tasks are much harder than
reading, adding, or remembering dates in history. They do have to go to
school to learn written language, arithmetic, and science because these
bodies of knowledge and skill were invented too recently for any species-
wide knack for them to have evolved (p. 222).

Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology
If this evolutionary view proposed by Pinker is correct, we would expect that
as children move through their compulsory schooling and presumably from a
curriculum centered on concrete operational / biologically primary abilities to one
centered on formal operational / biologically secondary abilities that student
motivation would shift from intrinsic to extrinsic. This is exactly the pattern that
we find. Steinberg (1996) reports "we know that early on ­ in preschool, for
example - children are highly intrinsically motivated and naturally curious, and
they need little in the way of extrinsic rewards to motivate them to participate
energetically in classroom activities (p. 73). Steinberg goes on to note that:
Regardless of what parents and teachers wish, intrinsic motivation plays a
relatively small role in motivating student performance in adolescence and
beyond. In our survey, for example, the most common reason students gave
for trying hard in school was not genuine interest in the material, but getting
good grades in order to get into the college (p. 74).
Constructivist theorists have contributed many useful ideas to make instruction
more interesting and meaningful. However, because they fail to distinguish
between biologically primary abilities and biologically secondary abilities they do
not recognize that there are situations where these techniques may fall short.
They have erred in accepting an inadequate understanding of how cognitive skills
develop and they have made the mistake of elevating a delimited set of
instructional techniques into an overarching philosophy of teaching. A pedagogy
informed by evolutionary psychology will, on the other hand, try to root teaching
in a modern evolutionary understanding of cognitive development and recognize
that much academic learning will continue to be hard work requiring extrinsic
support.
