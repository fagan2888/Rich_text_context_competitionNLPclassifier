Introduction
In Thailand, cancer is still a critical health problem because it
has been the leading cause of death for more than 10 years
(Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Thailand, 2010). There are
advances in medicine to treat cancer, but the numbers of can-
cer patients who die from this disease increase every year.
Moreover, there are the ongoing changes in the health care
system (American Cancer Society, 2010; Jemal, Siegel, Xu &
Ward, 2010). This change has resulted in a shift of cancer care
from hospital to home settings (Girgis & Lambert, 2009). The
numbers of cancer patients seen in the outpatient department
increased from 846,062 cases (14.78/1,000 persons) in the
year 2007 to 1,138,585 cases (19.72/1,000 persons) in the
year 2009 (Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Thailand, 2010).
This shift indicates that the family's involvement in caring for
persons with cancer has increased and may reflect an increas-
ing impact of cancer on family members (Given, Given &
Kozachik, 2001).
The literature suggests that cancer patients have several
kinds of problems and needs including symptom manage-
ment, disease and treatment monitoring, medication admin-
istration, psycho-emotional support, assistance with activities
of daily living, and assistance with instrument care (Esper,
2010; Marcusen, 2010). The patient's problems and needs
can cause burdens for family caregivers because they are
often unprepared to provide care for the patients at home
(Cameron, Shin, Diane Williams, & Stewart, 2004). They
also receive only minimal attention from most health care
providers, who tend to be focused primarily on the patients'
needs (Ferrell et al., 2011). They are a vulnerable and at-risk
population that remains neglected by the health care system
(Blum & Sherman, 2010). Hence, it is not surprising that
research findings revealed that family caregivers' various
needs and health concerns pertaining to caring for a loved
one with cancer at home are inadequately explored.
Specifically, knowledge and information needs have been
reported as the greatest needs among family caregivers
(Blum & Sherman, 2010). In addition, the results of studies
with cancer caregivers found that cancer affects all aspects of
family caregivers including their physical, psychological,
social, financial, and spiritual well-being (Girgis & Lambert,
2009; Klemm & Wheeler, 2005; Stenberg, Ruland, &
Miaskowski, 2010; Wilkinson, 2010). Family caregivers
need help from other people and health care providers to

Family Caregivers for Cancer Patients in
Thailand: An Integrative Review
Warunee Meecharoen1,2, Laurel L. Northouse3,
Yupapin Sirapo-ngam1, and Supreeda Monkong1
Abstract
This integrative review was conducted to describe findings from Thai studies concerning family caregivers for cancer patients.
Twenty-three studies that were published from 1994 to 2009 were considered. There were 15 quantitative studies and 8
qualitative studies. The stress and coping model developed by Lazarus and Folkman was the most popular theory that was
used to guide the studies. The variables that were explored in the quantitative studies consisted of social support, stress,
coping, caregiver burden, quality of life (QOL), and others. The qualitative findings revealed that there were several themes
such as the following: the meaning of being family caregivers for cancer patients, the meaning of care, the experiences of
caregivers, and the problems and needs of family caregivers in the Thai context. The evidence from the 23 studies reviewed
showed that the state of knowledge of cancer caregivers in the Thai context is at an early stage compared with the state of
knowledge in Western countries. More research needs to be done to explore the concepts related to negative and positive
outcomes of caregiving.

maintain their own well-being and to be able to maintain
their role as family caregivers.
From the Western perspective, the studies that focused on
caregivers of cancer patients have evolved from an embry-
onic stage to something resembling adolescence, this follow-
ing four generations of studies (Lewis, 2006; Lewis, 2009).
The literature comprises studies that identify the importance
of cancer's impact on the family, including descriptive and
hypothesis-testing studies. Studies have moved from primar-
ily stress-adaptation-coping models to family systems mod-
els. Furthermore, there are more studies focused on rigorous
intervention criteria for caregivers or family members. Those
studies are data-based, theory-informed intervention studies
developed with the goal of improving family members'
adjustment to cancer (Lewis, 2006, 2009). However, there is
little information about the state of knowledge of caregivers
for cancer patients in Thailand. We will be less effective in
planning care if we do not understand the needs of family
caregivers for cancer patients in the Thai context. Hence the
purpose of this integrative review was to describe findings
from studies of Thai family caregivers for cancer patients as
a basis for facilitating new directions in research and clinical
practice.And so the research question that guided this review
was, "What is the state of knowledge about family caregivers
for patients with cancer in Thailand?"
Method
The literature review for this study includes a search of the
Thailand Library Integrated System (ThaiLIS), the Research
Library of National Research Council of Thailand, E-Theses
in the Library of Thai universities including Burapha
University, Chiang Mai University, Chulalongkorn
University, Kasetsart University, Khon Kaen University,
Mahidol University, Naresuan, University, Prince of Songkla
University, and Thammasat University, this with no date
limitations. In addition, published articles in Thai journals,
hard copy of theses, and reference lists of articles found by
hand searching were included in this review. E-theses,
research articles, and hard copy of theses that were included
in this integrative review had to meet the following inclusion
criteria: qualitative or quantitative research design, study par-
ticipants were adult family caregivers providing care for adult
patients with cancer in Thailand, published or unpublished,
and in Thai or the English language. Key search terms that
were used included caregiver, carer, spouse or partner, rela-
tives, family member, caregiving, and cancer in Thai and the
English language. An electronic form was developed by the
researcher to record detailed information about research.
The data were extracted from the primary study in the fol-
lowing areas: research title, author, year of publication, pub-
lication vehicle (e.g., thesis, journal article), research
question/purpose, framework, method, variable, instrument,
participant, characteristics of caregiver, and findings. Data
were analyzed using descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency,
percentages, mean, and range) to describe the information
obtained from the research studies. Moreover, content analy-
sis was used to categorize the research findings. Categories
that were extracted and presented in this article included
study characteristics, conceptual or theoretical frameworks,
research variables, sampling techniques and caregivers' char-
acteristics, and research findings.
Results
Study Characteristics
There were 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The
studies were published from 1994 to 2009. The publications
were from 5 journal articles, 17 theses, and 1 dissertation. Of
the research designs used in the 23 studies in this review, 15
studies were quantitative design and 8 studies were qualita-
tive design. The quantitative studies comprised 14 descrip-
tive or correlational studies (Chansirimongkol, 2007;
Cheewapoonphon, 1998; Issarapanit, 2006; Kasamkijwatana,
Phuwarawuthipanich, Nampetch, & Khamwicha, 1996;

Wannasiri, 2005) and one quasi-experimental study
(Sakunhongsophon, 1997). The qualitative studies comprised
threephenomenologicalstudies(Duandaw,2004;Kitrungrote,
Wonghongkul, Chanprasit, Sutharangsee, & Cohen, 2008;
Prechavittayakul, 2006), one ethnography and phenomeno-
logical study (Klungkong, 2009), one ethnographic perspec-
tive study (Junda, 2004), and three qualitative studies in which
the researchers did not provide details of the study design
(Maneejumnong, 2008; Srikumnerd, 2008; Wiseso, 2002).
Conceptual Frameworks
All quantitative studies (15 studies) described the conceptual
or theoretical frameworks that were used to guide the
research. They were the transactional model of stress and
coping developed by Lazarus & Folkman in 1984 (seven
studies, 46.67%), Roy's adaptation model (two studies,
13.33%), Orem's theory (one study, 6.67%), the concept of
caregiver burden developed by Oberst in 1991 (one study,
6.67%), caregiver burden of Zarit, Reever, and Bach-
Peterson in 1980 (one study, 6.67%), the Jalowiec concepts
of stress coping (one study, 6.67%), and the model developed
by the researchers (two studies, 13.33%).
Research Variables
The variables that were explored in the quantitative studies
consisted of social support (six studies, 40%), caregiver's
Meecharoen et al. 3
stress (five studies, 33.33%), coping (five studies, 33.33%),
caregiver burden (four studies, 26.67%), caregiver's needs
(three studies, 20.0%), quality of life (QOL; three studies,
20%), health status (two studies, 13.33%), sense of coher-
ence (one study, 6.67%), adaptation (one study, 6.67%), hope
(one study, 6.67%), preparedness (one study, 6.67%), care-
giving behavior (one study, 6.67%), and family hardiness
(one study, 6.67%).
Sampling Techniques and Caregiver's
Characteristics
Most sampling techniques were purposive sampling (22
studies, 95.7%), and one was simple random sampling (one
studies, 4.3%). The data for the studies were gathered from
several sources including tertiary/supertertiary hospitals (17
studies, 73.9%), cancer centers (two studies, 8.7%), home
(three studies, 13.0%), and mixed-source (one study 4.3%).
Most studies (14 studies, 60.9%) recruited the participants
from the outpatient department. The number of study partici-
pants ranged from 30 to 270 caregivers in quantitative stud-
ies and 7 to 17 caregivers in qualitative studies.
The caregivers' characteristics varied among the studies.
The family caregivers ranged from 14 to 79 years of age, with
a mean age of 42.91. Most of them were female (66.83%),
and married (74.09%). In the 17 studies that reported the rela-
tionship between family caregiver and cancer patients, most
of them (48.87%) were spouses, and 21.18% were adult chil-
dren. The types of cancer patients who received care from
family caregivers were breast cancer (two studies), head and
neck cancer (two studies), mixed types (15 studies), or those
that did not specify the type (4 studies). Moreover, most stud-
ies (13 studies, 56.52%) focused on several stages of cancer
including advanced stage. There were 9 studies that focused
on family caregivers for patients with advanced or terminal-
stage cancer.
Research Findings
The quantitative studies reported various findings. For
example, some studies reported that the family caregivers
had moderate to high level of stress and had a fairly good
level of QOL (Chansirimongkol, 2007; Pitimana-aree, 2007;
Ungwattansirikul, 2007). Studies indicated that the level of
caregiver burden, and caregiver needs perceived by family
caregivers were at a moderate level (Kasinpila, 2007;
Wannasiri, 2005). Family caregivers' problems and needs
comprised physical, psychological, financial, family, social,
and knowledge (Maneewan, et al., 1994). Moreover, corre-
lational studies indicated that there was the relationship
between several factors and caregiving outcomes. For
example, caregiver's needs were positively related to care-
giver burden (Tamtup, 2005; Wannasiri, 2005), family har-
diness was negatively related to caregiver burden (Tamtup,
2005), caregiver burden was negatively associated with
caregiver adaptation (Cheewapoonphon, 1998), and social
support and coping were positively associated with care-
giver's QOL (Pitimana-aree, 2007; Ungwattansirikul, 2007).
Details are provided in Table 1.
In the qualitative studies, the experiences of Thai family
caregivers varied. The research findings also revealed sev-
eral themes such as the following: the meaning of being
family caregivers of cancer patients, the meaning of care,
the experiences of caregivers, and problems and needs of
family caregivers in the Thai context. The theme pertaining
to the meaning of being family caregivers of patients with
cancer comprised four categories: (a) It was time to return
favors to the patients, (b) they could take better care of the
patients than somebody else who was not a family member,
(c) they displayed sympathy, understanding, and willingness
to take care of the patients, and (d) it was their responsibility
(Wiseso, 2002). The theme pertaining to meaning of care
comprised two categories: (a) to help patients in every mat-
ter to make them comfortable physically and mentally and
(b) to help patients do what they could not do for themselves
(Prechavittayakul, 2006). The theme about the caregiver's
experiences comprised six categories: (a) "being committed
for life to spouses," (b) "enhancing the spouse's comfort,"
(c) "being a co-sufferer," (d) "readjusting themselves," (e)
"appreciating people's support," (f) and "being gratified
with self-development and marital life growth" (Kitrungrote,
et al., 2008). Details are shown in Table 2.
Discussion
This article is the first integrative review of family caregivers
in Thailand. It is acknowledged that there may be several
studies that might have been missed because the current
database in Thailand falls short of inclusivity; most of the
studies were not published in any journals. Even though this
review included quantitative and qualitative studies, it is dif-
ficult to synthesize information and draw conclusions about
the state of knowledge of family caregivers for patients with
cancer in Thai culture. Hence, characteristics of family care-
givers and related methodological issues will be discussed in
this section.
Characteristics of Family Caregivers
In the Thai context, a family caregiver was defined as a fam-
ily member who has blood relations with patients (i.e.,
father, mother, sister, bother, son, daughter, nephew, or
niece) or a legal relationship (i.e., husband, wife, daughter
in law, son in law, or mother in law), who lives in the same
house with a loved one with cancer, and who provides
unpaid care for a cancer patient (Chansirimongkol, 2007;
Cheewapoonphon, 1998; Kasinpila, 2007; Kunsabal, 2007;
Pitimana-aree, 2007; Sakunhongsophon, 1997; Tamtup,
2005; Ungwattansirikul, 2007; Wannasiri, 2005). This defi-
nition was consistent with the traditional definitions of

In addition, it was found that worry from caring was
negatively related to health status (r = ­.494, p <

in 24.5% of the sample, while hope was positively
associated with health status of caregivers (r =

additional 10.2%. Finally, preparedness was positively
related to health status of caregivers (r = .320, p<

situation related to direct care for the persons with
cancer and to the impacts of caregiving on the family
caregivers' life. Confrontive coping was most used to
deal with the stress. The biggest source of support
the family caregivers received was from their family
members in the forms of emotional support, service,
and tangible support. The caregivers perceived a
fairly good level of QOL. There was no correlation
of the stress level, coping, and social support, to
QOL of family caregivers.

Caregiver's problems included stress.
Sometimes caregivers had no help from
others and had no skill for caring. Economic
problems were having high expenses, leaving
their jobs and losing income, and going into
debt. Problems of the health care system
were out of reach information, long waiting
times for service, complicated process,
no strong analgesics in primary care units,
limitation of referral system, staff having
inadequate time, unskillful staff, and staff's
lack of concern.

To study spiritual health
of caregivers in the
case of Muslim end-

The situation of end-stage cancer has
emotional impacts on caregivers that often
affect the relationship between caregivers
and patients. All caregivers believed that
pain and disease were decreed by God or
Allah. Despite several problems encountered
during the care of the patients, the caregivers
deeply believed in God's help. If patients died,
the caregivers would accept it. This reflected
that caregivers' wills were determined by

family that includes a nuclear family comprising father,
mother, and one or more children, or the extended family
comprising grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins (Blum,
2010).Although the National Family CaregiversAssociation
(2010) stated that defining the meaning of family caregivers
was complicated and varied according to the people who
defined it, the Thai definition of family caregiver seemed
similar to its meaning in the Western perspective. However,
according to the definition in the Thai context, a family
caregiver usually referred to a person in an extended family,
and the Western family caregiver was often referred to as a
person in a nuclear family. The extended family scenario
might have advantages for Thai patients with cancer because
they will have several personal resources that can help them
to deal with their cancer effectively. In both cultures, the
family caregiver was usually a wife, mother, grandmother,
or other female family member because caregiving was
viewed as a feminine activity or quality (Blum, 2010). So, it
is not surprising that this review found that most of family
caregivers were female.
Methodological Issues
Methodological issues that were discussed in this section
included the study's theoretical framework, samples issues,
and instrument issues.
All Thai studies in the review were developed by master's
or doctoral students and the nursing faculty from several uni-
versities. Moreover, the researchers used the conceptual or
theoretical framework to guide their research. Therefore, it is
believed that all studies that were included in this review
were developed by using rigorous scientific methodology.
Theoretical framework.The stress and coping model devel-
oped by Lazarus & Folkman (1984) was the most popular
theory that was used to guide the research. If we compare the
studies in Thailand to studies in Western countries, it can be
seen that Thai studies were consistent with the second gen-
eration of cancer caregiver studies in Western countries,
studies that focused on the seriousness or magnitude of stress
that cancer caused in their caregivers (Lewis, 2009). The
studies in this generation used the stress-adaptation-coping
model as a guide. Although the Thai studies used models that
were developed in Western contexts, the research findings
revealed that those models fit with the data in the Thai con-
text. But increased model testing needs to be done in Thai-
land in any case.
Sample issues.There was limited access to the participants
who were family caregivers for cancer patients in Thailand
because there is no adequate database concerning said cancer
caregivers. Most participants (97.1%) in the studies were
recruited by purposive sampling from outpatient department
in the tertiary hospitals. There were only 47 caregivers who
were recruited from home-based settings. Most quantitative
studies (60%) had small sample sizes (< 100 samples). As a
result, the current research findings cannot be generalized to
the cancer caregiver population as a whole. If researchers
want to increase their understanding about caregiver's expe-
riences and outcomes, they need to increase recruitment of
more participants in community or home-based settings.
This should help refine the database for future studies.
Instrument issues.Evidence suggests that most instruments
for data collection in the Thai studies were borrowed from
Western cultures. Examples of the instruments that were
translated into Thai language were the Zarit Burden Inter-
view (ZBI) developed by Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson
(1980); the family hardiness index (FHI) developed by
McCubbin Thompson, and McCubbin (1996); the Jalowiec
Coping Scale (JCS) developed by Jalowiec (1988); and the
social support questionnaire (SSQ) developed by Schaefer et
al. (1981). Although these instruments were developed in
Western contexts, they continued to have high reliability
when used in Thai culture. However, researchers still need to
assess these carefully when they use the translated question-
naires because the characteristics of Thai caregivers may be
different from Western caregivers. In the Thai context, reli-
gion, belief, culture, and traditional ways of life played major
roles in the caring for family members. The caregiving for
patients who were their spouses or parents was a way to
show appreciation. Taking care of a family member is an
affective reward and a strong norm of familial obligation in
the Thai culture (Caffrey, 1992; Thongprateep, 2005). Bud-
dhist caregivers especially believed that caring was a way to
reimburse for past good deeds, to gain merit, and to return
gratitude to their relatives. The caregiving role was perceived
as an integral part of a Thai's life, an unavoidable task that
was provided with love, sympathy, and attachment (Subgra-
non & Lund, 2000). Conversely, Western people are nor-
mally more independent from family ties than people in
Asian countries. When Westerners assume roles as primary
caregivers, they may experience more suffering because they
are less likely to be familiar with such new roles. Therefore,
impacts of cancer caregiving may differ widely between
Thais and those adhering to Western caregivers'
perceptions.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The number of cancer caregivers should increase continuously
in the near future. Evidence from the 23 studies reviewed
showed that the state of knowledge concerning cancer care-
givers in the Thai context is in an embryonic state compared
with the state of knowledge in Western countries. The research
findings revealed that providing care for cancer patients has
various impacts on caregivers. Several concepts related to
caregiver outcomes (i.e., caregiver burden, caregiver's QOL,
coping, and social support) need to be examined more closely.
There are some possible limitations of the present review.
Meecharoen et al. 9
First, there may be a number of studies that might have been
missed because of the inadequacy of the database in Thailand;
most of the studies cited were not published in any journals.
Second, all of the studies were developed by nursing scien-
tists. So the state of knowledge may be not broad in scope.
Third, all studies in this review were developed by nursing
educators rather than by nurses in a clinical setting. The pres-
ent study may not fully reflect the phenomena of caregiving
from the clinical perspective. Future research needs to further
explore the concepts related to negative and positive outcomes
of caregiving. More studies are needed with focus on sample
sizes, and which include sensitivity to measurements specific
to Thai culture. Expanding the understanding of caregiving's
impact and related factors in cancer caregiver populations
would enable nurses to develop innovative interventions to
decrease negative outcomes and improve positive outcomes of
caregiving for cancer patients.
