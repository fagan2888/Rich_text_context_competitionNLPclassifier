Objective: To investigate rates and severity of child and
adult food insecurity (the inability to access enough food
in a socially acceptable way for every day of the year) in
households with and without smokers.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Nationally representative sample of the US popu-
lation from 1999 to 2002.
Participants: Households with children through age 17
years (n=8817) in the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey.
Main Exposure: Presence or absence of adult smok-
ers in the household. Covariates included age, sex, and
race/ethnicity of the child, and the poverty index ratio.
Main Outcome Measure: Rates and severity of food
insecurity were ascertained using the US Department of
Agriculture Food Security Survey Module.
Results: Food insecurity was more common and se-
vere in children and adults in households with smok-
ers. Of children in households with smokers, 17.0% were
food insecure vs 8.7% in households without smokers
(P.001). Rates of severe child food insecurity were 3.2%
vs 0.9% (P.04), respectively. For adults, 25.7% in house-
holds with smokers and 11.6% in households without
smokers were food insecure, and rates of severe food in-
security were 11.8% and 3.9%, respectively (P.003 for
each). Food insecurity was higher in low-income com-
pared with higher income homes (P.01). At multivar-
iate analyses, smoking was independently associated with
food insecurity and severe food insecurity in children (ad-
justed odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.7,
and adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-
6.9, respectively) and adults (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95%
confidence interval, 1.6-3.0, and adjusted odds ratio, 2.3;
95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.7, respectively).
Conclusions: Living with adult smokers is an indepen-
dent risk factor for adult and child food insecurity, as-
sociated with an approximate doubling of its rate and tri-
pling of the rate of severe food insecurity.

APPROXIMATELY 13 MIL-
lion children in the United
States live in food-inse-
cure households,1 experi-
encing periods during
which they skip meals, are hungry, and
even have entire days or longer without
eating.1 Thesechildren,andthosewhomay
not experience food insecurity directly but
live in households with adults who do,
demonstrate measurably negative effects
on their physical health,2-6 neuropsycho-
logical development,3,7-9 scores on stan-
dardized tests of academic achievement,8
and quality of life.10 Objective 19-18 of
Healthy People 201011 sets a goal for a na-
tional rate of household food insecurity of
no more than 6% overall by 2010, but re-
cent data indicate that in 1 year in the
United States, 11% of all households ex-
perience food insecurity and almost 4% of
all households experience severe food in-
security.1
Food security is defined as the access at
all times to enough food for an active
healthy life.12,13 This includes, at a mini-
mum, the availability of nutritionally ad-
equate and safe foods and the ability to ac-
quire these foods in socially acceptable
ways.12,13 In contrast, food insecurity is the
inability to access enough food in a so-
cially acceptable way for every day of the
year.12 In households with the most se-
vere food insecurity, there are multiple in-
voluntary reductions in food intake and
disruptions of usual eating patterns.14,15
Food insecurity is strongly associated
with household income.1,16,17 Families with
at least 1 smoker spend 2% to 20% of their
income on tobacco.18-20 Therefore, house-
hold smokers can significantly affect fi-
nancial resources because most smokers
in the United States are poor or near

hold smoking and food insecurity in children and the
adults with whom they live has not been previously ex-
amined. In this study, we assessed the following ques-
tions: Do children and adults living in households with
smokers have a greater likelihood of experiencing food
insecurity compared with children living in households
without smokers? If yes, is adult smoking also associ-
ated with severe food insecurity in the children and adults
in their households?
METHODS
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002 were examined. NHANES
is a nationally representative survey that uses a multistage, clus-
tered, stratified sampling design, is conducted annually by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and is reported every 2 years. Before
1999, NHANES assessed food insecurity for the respondent's
household as a whole, not allowing for the separate assess-
ment of food insecurity in the children and adults residing to-
gether in particular households. Since 1999, NHANES has in-
cluded the US Department of Agriculture Food Security Survey
Module as part of its household questionnaire (see the "Food
Security Survey Module" subsection).
SAMPLE
Children were defined by the legal definition of a minor, that
is, age 17 years or younger, and all such individuals with rel-
evant data were included. All variables used were obtained from
either the sample person files (the individual files for the per-
son aged 17 years) or the family demographic data, which
were linked to the specific sample person. All aspects of NHANES
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, and informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
VARIABLES
Covariates included were limited to child and household vari-
ables. In the NHANES data set, once the child was selected, only
household data could be linked to the child. Parental demo-
graphic data were not linkable to the sample child in the data
set and were not included in the analysis. Therefore, indepen-
dent variables included child age, sex, and race/ethnicity; house-
hold poverty index ratio (PIR); and reported residence in a home
with at least 1 adult smoker. Each of these variables was ana-
lyzed for comparisons between households in which children
reside with and without smokers and for their associations with
child and adult food security status in these households.
The PIR is the total household income divided by the fed-
eral poverty threshold for that particular household of speci-
fied size.23 A PIR of 1 indicates a household income at the pov-
erty level; a PIR of 2 indicates a household income at twice the
poverty level; and so on. Children living in households with a
PIR less than 1.85 were categorized as living in low-income
households because this is the general income level below which
a household is eligible for 2 of the 3 largest US Department of
Agriculture food and nutrition services from the federal food
assistance programs: the Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-
gram for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School
Lunch Program.24 The third program is the Food Stamp Pro-
gram, which has a lower income threshold (PIR of 1.3), and
so was included in the households with a PIR less than 1.85.25
Researchers have determined that families living in house-
holds with a PIR of 2 or less are considered low-income fami-
lies.26 Therefore, a PIR of 1.85 encompasses low-income fami-
lies who are eligible for federal food assistance programs.
Households were characterized as smoking households if
the survey respondent answered affirmatively to the question,
"Does anyone who lives here smoke cigarettes anywhere in-
side this home?" and as nonsmoking households if this ques-
tion was answered negatively.
FOOD SECURITY SURVEY MODULE
Food security, insecurity, and severe insecurity were assessed
using the US Department of Agriculture Food Security Survey
Module. This module was developed to assess the presence and
severity of food deprivation resulting from inadequate house-
hold resources during the preceding 12 months14 and has been
used by the federal government and researchers in numerous
previous studies and reports.* Food security status was as-
sessed separately for children and adults in the home on the
basis of scores on the adult and child modules of the Food Se-
curity Survey Module, as recommended.
Scoring of the Food Security Survey Module uses an 18-
point scale (Table 1) based on 18 questions, 10 of which per-
tain to adults in the home and the remaining 8 to those aged
17 years or younger who live in the home with the adults. The
survey is scored on a continuous scale but typically is re-
ported in terms of specific categories on the basis of ranges of
scores.14 For an adult to be considered food insecure, an affir-
mative answer to at least 3 questions is needed. On the child
food security scale, an affirmative answer to any 2 questions
indicates food insecurity.14

Adults may be categorized as highly food secure (0 affir-
mative answers), marginally food secure (1-2 affirmative an-
swers, indicating anxiety about food sufficiency but no changes
in intake), low food secure (3-5 affirmative answers, indicat-
ing reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet), or very low
food security (6-10 affirmative answers, indicating decreased
food intake and disrupted eating patterns).33 Children may be
categorized as highly food secure (0 affirmative answers), mar-
ginally food secure (1 affirmative answer), low food secure (2-4
affirmative answers), or very low food secure (5-8 affirmative
answers).33 The US Department of Agriculture accepts com-
bining the categories for adults and children into 2 categories
for each group--food secure and food insecure.31-33 This study
combines highly food secure and marginally food secure as food
secure, and uses 2 categories of food insecurity: food insecure,
which includes low food secure and very low food secure, and
severely food insecure, which is the classically used term for
those adults and children who meet the criteria for very low
food secure.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All statistical analyses were performed using commercially avail-
able software (SUDAAN version 9.0.1; RTI International, Re-
search Triangle Park, North Carolina) to accommodate sample
design complexities such as oversampling certain segments of
the population. The appropriate statistical weights were ap-
plied to produce national estimates.
Bivariate analyses were conducted to assess the associations
of adult and child food insecurity with household and indi-
vidual factors. All comparisons were made using the 2 test to de-
termine statistical significance set at P.05. The association of
adult smoking in the household with adult and child food inse-
curity was determined for the entire sample and stratified by child
age, sex, and race/ethnicity; household smoking; and PIR.
Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to in-
vestigate possible independent associations of adult house-
hold smokers and increased prevalence and severity of food in-
security in children and adults in these homes. Separate
regression analyses were performed for adults and children, both
to explore food insecurity overall and to explore whether se-
vere food insecurity, which includes severe disruptions and de-
crease in food intake, is independently associated with the pres-
ence of adult household smokers. The regression models
included all 8817 households who answered the Food Secu-
rity Survey Module. The first model included all households
with outcomes dichotomized into food-secure and food-
insecure groups. The second model also included all house-
holds with outcomes dichotomized into severe food insecu-
rity and all other food security groups. All multivariable models
included as covariates child age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and
household PIR.
RESULTS
A total of 8817 households with children and adoles-
cents were included in the analyses. Table 2 gives the
characteristics of these children and their households. Al-
most one-fourth of the households had an annual in-
come below the poverty level, and almost half were clas-
sified as low-income families (185% of the poverty level).
Approximately 23% of households with children in-
cluded at least 1 adult smoker, and 32% of children in
low-income households lived with a smoker compared
with 15% of those in more affluent households (P.001).
Overall, 15% of adults and 11% of children experienced
some degree of food insecurity during the previous 12
months, with 6% of adults and 1% of children experi-
encing severe food insecurity (very low food security)
(P=.02 and P.001, respectively).
Table 3 gives the rates of child food insecurity over-
all and severe child food insecurity (very low security)
by child and household characteristics. Rates of child-
hood food insecurity in those living in households with
smokers were approximately double (17% vs 9%;
P.001), and rates of children experiencing severe food
insecurity were more than triple (3% vs 0.9%; P=.04) com-
pared with those in nonsmoking households.
Black and Hispanic families had higher rates of child
food insecurity in both smoking and nonsmoking house-
holds compared with white and other families. The high-
est rates of food insecurity were in children living in low-
income households with smokers (25% vs 17% for those
in low-income homes with and without smokers, respec-
tively; P=.01). While not statistically significant for house-
holds with a PIR at or above 1.85, the trend was for chil-
dren in household with smokers to have higher rates of
food insecurity compared with those in similar eco-
nomic circumstances in households without smokers.

Table 4 gives factors associated with rates of adult
food insecurity. While rates are higher for adults than
for the children they live with, the associations with liv-
ing in households with smokers are similar to those found
for children. Overall, 26% of adults living in house-
holds with children and smokers were food insecure com-
pared with 12% of adults living in households with chil-
dren but with no smokers (P.001). Low-income
households with smokers had the highest rates of adult
food insecurity, similar to the finding for children. House-
hold smoking was associated with triple the rate of se-
vere food insecurity in adults compared with house-
holds without smokers (12% vs 4%; P.003). Rates of
severe food insecurity were also highest in adults in low-
income households with smokers, with 17% of adults in
such households experiencing severe food insecurity com-
pared with 8% who lived in low-income homes without
smokers (P=.01).

age, sex, and race/ethnicity and for household income,
smoking in the household was a significant indepen-
dent predictor of both child food insecurity (adjusted odds
ratio [AOR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.7)
and severe food insecurity (AOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-6.9).
Living in low-income households was associated with in-
creased rates of both categories of food insecurity (AOR,
8.1; 95% CI, 5.0-13.0, and AOR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.8-20.5,
respectively), and younger child age was associated with
lower rates of food insecurity. Male sex was indepen-
dently associated with severe food insecurity (AOR, 1.9;
95% CI, 1.2-3.0). Adults demonstrate findings similar to
those found in children: living in a low-income house-
hold and in a household with smokers were both inde-
pendently associated with higher rates of food insecu-
rity and severe food insecurity (Table 5).
COMMENT
This study confirms how common food insecu-
rity1,13,17,29,30,34 and exposure to secondhand smoke are for
children living in US households with low income.35-37
Never before demonstrated, to our knowledge, these data
indicate that living with adult smokers is an indepen-
dent risk factor for children's food insecurity, associ-
ated with an approximate doubling of its rate and a tri-
pling of the rate of severe food insecurity, even after
controlling for household income. In low-income house-
holds, 1 in 3 children live with a smoker, and in such
households, 1 of 4 children and 1 of 3 adults experience
some degree of food insecurity. One of 20 children and
1 of 6 adults in low-income homes with smokers have
severely compromised diets.
In the United States in 2005, an estimated $82 billion
was spent to purchase cigarettes, with the average price
of a pack of cigarettes being more than $4.38 Families with
low income, in general, are more likely to experience food
insecurity,1,16 spend less on food,1,16 and spend a larger
percentage of available money on tobacco compared with
more affluent families.13,30 In developing countries such
as Bangladesh, China, and Bulgaria, tobacco expendi-
tures crowd out expenditures for food, health care, and
education.18,20,39 While the available data do not enable
us to examine whether this is the mechanism behind the
findings presented herein, it seems plausible.
Although the effect of poverty on food insecurity can-
not be overstated, inasmuch as it was the greatest inde-
pendent predictor, it does not explain all food insecu-
rity. Smoking was a significant independent predictor of
food insecurity even after controlling for household in-
come level. Possible mechanisms beyond the economic
effect of tobacco may include behavioral or psychoso-
cial differences in smoking households compared with
nonsmoking households in terms of dietary behavior and
food acquisition. Smokers have different dietary atti-
tudes and behaviors than those of nonsmokers, and this
may extend to feeding practices of their children as
well.40,41 This relationship cannot be tested with the cur-
rent data set, and further research is needed to assess these
characteristics.
Race/ethnicity also has a strong role in food insecu-
rity; black and Hispanic families experience higher rates
of food insecurity compared with white families.42-45 This
was reinforced in this analysis with only nonsmoking
white and other households approaching the Healthy
People 201011 goal of a 6% food insecurity rate. All other
racial/ethnic families had rates of food insecurity exceed-
ing this goal, regardless of smoking status. The ethnic
group referred to as other seems to be protective against
food insecurity in the adjusted analysis. This group con-
sists of people who declare themselves to be multieth-
nic or any other single ethnic group that is not white,
black, or Hispanic. Owing to the heterogeneity of this
other group, it is difficult to speculate on the reason it
would be protected from food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at higher
risk for cognitive and psychosocial disability,3,8 poorer
quality of life,10 and higher rates of suicidal ideation.7 They
have lower scores on standardized academic tests, miss
more days of school, and have more difficulty getting along
with others.8 They also have poorer overall health, higher
lead levels, increased rates of iron deficiency, and more
emergency department use and hospitalizations.2-6 More-
over, related literature indicates that even food-secure chil-
dren experience deleterious effects from living with food-
insecure adults.9,10
Child sex differences were noted in this study. Al-
though sex was not a significant predictor of food insecu-
rity,malesexwasindependentlyassociatedwithseverechild
food insecurity. Sex differences related to nutrition have
beenreportedasrecentstudiesindevelopedcountrieshave
shown that boys may consume more carbohydrates than
girls do46,47 and that girls may have a stronger preference
for nutritious foods.48,49 If boys and girls are consuming dif-
ferent types of foods, this may have an effect of sex on food
consumption. Additional research including a detailed di-
etary history is needed to further assess this theory.
There are limitations to this study. These data are cross-
sectional,limitingourabilitytodrawcausalinferences.The
potential of unmeasured confounders introducing unrec-
ognizedbiasesisapossibilityinanobservationalstudysuch
as this. Findings related to severe food insecurity were not
robust across all subgroups in the analysis. For example,
across racial/ethnic groups, smoking was significantly as-
sociated with severe food insecurity only for white fami-
lies; this may be because of the low number of subjects in-
cluded in these subgroups. Additional covariates likely
relatedtofoodinsecurityincludeparentaldemographicdata,
for example, immigration status, and nonincome finan-
cial support, such as participation in the Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Chil-
dren, which would have strengthened our findings.
However, these additional covariates were either unre-
portedinthedataorwerenotlinkabletothesampledcases.
Other limitations are that measures used were based
on adult report, and it is possible that the wording of the
question about the presence of adult smokers in the house-
hold may have led some respondents to answer no if there
were adult smokers living in the home who smoked only
outside the home. If this were the case, however, it would
falsely diminish rather than falsely inflate the indepen-
dent risk of food insecurity associated with adult house-
hold smokers. An additional limitation is that we could
not ascertain whether more household smokers was as-
sociated with higher rates and severity of food insecurity.
CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a rela-
tionship between adult smoking and child and adult food
insecurity in the United States. These data also demon-
strate how pervasive this combination of child health risks
is in low-income families. The burden of food insecurity
is a previously unrecognized danger of adult tobacco use
to be added to the ever growing list of negative effects of
adult tobacco use on children in the United States.
