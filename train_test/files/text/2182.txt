Abstract Although research has documented factors
associated with maternal smoking, we need a more in-depth
understanding of the risk factors associated with changes in
smoking behaviors during the postpartum period. We
investigate smoking patterns during pregnancy and 1 year
postpartum as a function of relevant psychosocial factors.
We use data on 3,522 postpartum mothers from the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study to analyze the predic-
tors of smoking among mothers who did not smoke during
pregnancy but smoked at 1 year postpartum, mothers who
smoked both during pregnancy and postpartum, and mothers
who did not smoke during either period. Our covariates are
grouped into four categories of risk factors for smoking:
socioeconomic status, health care, life course and health,
and partner and social support. Postpartum mothers in our
sample were more likely to smoke throughout or after their
pregnancies if they had only a high school education or less,
had a household income three or more times below the
poverty line, had public or no health insurance, breastfed for
less than 5 months, were not married to the infant's father, if
the infant's father currently smoked, and if they attended
religious services less than once a week. Mental health
problems were consistently associated with an increased
risk of constant and postpartum smoking relative to non-
smoking. Psychosocial factors play a role in postpartum
smoking, but they have a stronger effect in predicting
smoking that persists throughout pregnancy and the first
year postpartum.

Introduction
Much attention has been given to the health and health
behaviors of women during pregnancy because of direct
health risks to the infant. From a research perspective, there
has been less of an emphasis on mothers' health and health
behaviors during the period following the birth despite the
fact that experts view the postpartum period as a ``life
redefining transition'' marked by profound physiologic
changes in conjunction with new stressors, such as par-
enting challenges, body-image changes, and time and role
conflicts [1]. As a result, during the postpartum period the
mother may focus intently on her baby's well-being while
neglecting her own well-being. Behaviors such as alcohol
and tobacco use suspended during pregnancy may re-
emerge in the postpartum period [2]. Of particular interest
are maternal health behaviors during pregnancy and post-
partum that may not only harm the mother's health but also
have potentially negative effects on the health of the child.
Exposure to secondhand smoke after birth puts infants at
risk. Recent studies show increased emergency room visits,
hospitalizations, and sick days due to respiratory illnesses
among children ages 0­4 years who are exposed to sec-
ondhand smoke [3].

Research on the deleterious effects of cigarette, alcohol,
and drug use during pregnancy on neonatal outcomes is
widely published [4­7]. Perhaps as a result of the wide-
spread discussion of the ill-effects on infant outcomes,
many women abstain from or decrease substance use dur-
ing pregnancy [8]. Data from the 2004 National Survey on
Drug Use and Health [9] show significantly lower rates of
tobacco use among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking in
the past month was reported by 18% of pregnant women
versus 30% of nonpregnant women ages 15­44. Similarly,
in a study on lay advice regarding alcohol and tobacco use
with 105 low-income pregnant women who smoked prior
to pregnancy, over half abstained from smoking one or
more months during their pregnancies [8].
If women abstain from or quit smoking during preg-
nancy, an important maternal health question is whether
they resume (or begin) smoking after the birth of the child.
In a study on smoking relapse in postpartum women,
researchers found that 94% of women who quit smoking
during pregnancy reported that concern for the health of
their unborn baby was their primary reason for quitting.
While 91% stated that they intended to abstain from
smoking after the baby was born, by 6 months postpartum
only 30% of them were still non-smokers [10].
Past studies on smoking during the time surrounding
pregnancy suggest that lower income, less education,
White ethnicity, age 20­29 years, and not being married to
the biological father of the baby place mothers at risk [11].
Contextual factors that also play a role are alcohol con-
sumption, not breastfeeding, number of household smok-
ers, and maternal depression. In a study by Martin et al.
[11], women who drank one or more alcoholic drinks per
week were more likely to smoke, less likely to quit, and
more likely to relapse than women who drank less than
that. Women who lived with another smoker were also
more likely to smoke at 24 months postpartum. Mothers
who did not breastfeed were more than twice as likely to
smoke and greater than four times more likely to relapse.
Postpartum depression was also positively correlated with
smoking at 24 months postpartum but was not related to
smoking relapse.
Although research has documented factors associated
with maternal smoking, we need a more in-depth under-
standing of changes in smoking behaviors through the
pregnancy and postpartum periods. Our study adds to the
existing literature by including more in-depth measures of
maternal psychosocial factors that may contribute to post-
partum smoking. We examine whether the risk profile for
smoking during pregnancy is similar to the risk profile for
women who abstain from smoking during pregnancy but
resume afterwards, or if it is possible to differentiate these
postpartum smokers. A psychosocial framework incorpo-
rates an individual's psychological well-being, family
environment, and access to health and financial resources.
We include measures of the mother's mental health,
availability of social support, and relationship status with
her partner. We also include a religious attendance variable
as one measure of access to social support. Greater fre-
quency of religious service attendance has been associated
with lower rates of smoking [12, 13]. We differentiate
between US-born and foreign-born Mexican origin women
in addition to the more commonly analyzed categories of
White, Black, and Hispanic women, as research has shown
that US-born and foreign-born women differ greatly in
their smoking behavior [14]. Information on mother's
health insurance, education, and poverty is included. The
addition of these variables to the existing literature on
smoking among postpartum women can further our
understanding of the psychosocial context that may predict
which women are most likely to smoke during the vul-
nerable postpartum phase.
In this study we take a closer look at changes in smoking
patterns among women during pregnancy and through the
first year postpartum period. We focus on the effects of
psychosocial factors among at-risk mothers by observing a
sample with a large number of unmarried urban mothers.
Unmarried mothers are especially vulnerable after the birth
of a child due to the precarious conditions often associated
with single parenthood. We explore what contributes to
postpartum smoking, that is, smoking after birth, both
among women who did not smoke during pregnancy and
women who did. Given that many of these postpartum
smokers stopped smoking during pregnancy because of the
health risks for the infant, we explore what risk factors
contribute to their starting smoking again with an eye
towards better informing postpartum maternal and child
health care.
Methods
Data
The data used in this study are drawn from the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study conducted by
Princeton and Columbia Universities [15]. The Fragile
Families Study is an ongoing, longitudinal, birth cohort
study of children born to predominantly unmarried parents.
The sample was drawn between 1998 and 2000 from
hospitals in cities with over 200,000 people and included
4,898 births. Parents were interviewed at the time of the
child's birth, as well as at 1, 3, and 5 years following the
birth. For this study we draw on data from the birth and
1-year follow-up interviews.
Our analytic sample consists of 3,522 1-year postpartum
mothers. Of the 4,898 mothers interviewed at the time of
250 Matern Child Health J (2012) 16:249­257
123
the child's birth in the initial baseline sample, we excluded
534 (11%) who were not interviewed at year 1. We also
excluded the 578 mothers who were pregnant at year 1
because their smoking behavior is no longer simply post-
partum, 193 mothers in the ``other'' race category because
this is an ambiguous and heterogeneous group, and 71
mothers who smoked during pregnancy but not in the year
after birth, a group too small to analyze separately. We
used Stata's multiple imputation methods to impute values
for 169 mothers who were missing data on one or more
analysis variables. Results using the multiple imputation
technique did not substantively differ from results using
listwise deletion (results available upon request).
Variables
Our dependent variable is a three-category indicator of
pregnancy and postpartum smoking based on maternal self
reports. We categorize mothers as ``non-smokers,'' ``con-
stant smokers,'' and ``postpartum smokers'' based on
questions asked about smoking at birth and at the 1-year
follow up. At birth, mothers were asked, ``During your
pregnancy, how many cigarettes did you smoke?'' We
coded mothers as non-smokers during pregnancy if they
answered ``none,'' whereas mothers are coded as smokers
during pregnancy if they answered ``less than 1 pack a
day,'' ``1 or more but less than 2 packs a day,'' or ``2 or
more packs a day.'' At year one, mothers were asked
whether they smoked cigarettes in the past month. We
coded mothers as non-smokers in the year after birth if they
answered ``no'' to this question; mothers were coded as
smokers in the year after birth if they answered ``yes'' to
this question. Thus, our three smoking categories are (a)
non-smokers, mothers who reported that they did not
smoke during pregnancy nor during the year following
birth, (b) constant smokers, mothers who reported smoking
both during pregnancy and in the year following birth; and
(c) postpartum smokers, mothers who reported that they
did not smoke during pregnancy but did smoke in the year
following birth. Table 1 shows the distribution of our
sample into these three categories: 72% of mothers were
non-smokers, 17% were constant smokers, and 10% were
postpartum smokers.
Our covariates are grouped into four categories com-
prising mothers' psychosocial factors: socioeconomic sta-
tus, health care, life course and health, and partner and
social support. Socioeconomic status variables include
mother's race/ethnicity, education, and household poverty
status. Based on mothers' self-reports of their race, eth-
nicity, and nativity at baseline, we categorized mothers as
US-born Mexican-origin, foreign-born Mexican-origin,
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and other His-
panic. Mother's education is categorized as less than high
school, a high school degree or its equivalent or some
college or higher. Household income-to-poverty ratios
were constructed by comparing the mother's reported
annual household income to federal poverty guidelines that
vary according to household composition (number of
children and adults). We distinguish between households
below the federal poverty level ($17,050 for a family of
four in 2000), households with incomes between 100 and
300% percent of the federal poverty level, and households
with incomes greater than 300% of the federal poverty
level.
We include two measures of access to and use of health
care, which were taken from the baseline survey. The first
is the mother's health insurance coverage, a bivariate
indicator distinguishing between private coverage and
public or no health insurance coverage. We group public
and no health insurance coverage together because very
few mothers in our sample reported no health insurance,
most likely because those who were uninsured were
enrolled in Medicaid during pregnancy or at the time of
labor. The second is the trimester when the mother began
prenatal care, which distinguishes between the first tri-
mester or other (including no prenatal care).
Life course and health variables include mother's age,
parity, mental health problem, parenting stress, and
breastfeeding. Mother's age at the time of the child's birth
is coded as a dummy variable to indicate mothers who are
less than 25 years old. We incorporate a measure of par-
enting stress that identifies mothers who report that they
``strongly agree'' that they feel trapped by their responsi-
bilities as a parent, find that taking care of their children is
much more work than pleasure, or often feel tired, worn
out, or exhausted from raising a family. We also include an
indicator to identify mothers who report that they were
diagnosed with or prescribed medicine for a mental health
problem within the last year. Finally, we include an indi-
cator of whether mothers breastfed for at least 5 months.
Partner and social support measures capture the level of
support from the father as well as support from other
sources. The first is the mother's relationship status with
the baby's father at baseline, which distinguishes between
married, cohabiting, dating, and other status (including
friends but not romantic, hardly talk, and unknown fathers)
parents. We also include a dummy for whether the father
suggested an abortion, based on mothers' reports, which
may capture the father's support of the mother and the
child [16]. A third indicator of social support is the father's
status as a smoker. We use data from father reports at
baseline and year one about their smoking status. Fathers
are defined as smokers if they report smoking at baseline or
year one. Because a substantial portion (24% of our sam-
ple) of fathers was not interviewed, we also include a
dummy variable to indicate whether the father data are

missing. A non-father measure of social support is the
mother's level of religious service attendance, under the
assumption that frequent attendance at religious services
provides mothers with social networks and psychosocial
support. We distinguish between mothers who attend reli-
gious services once or more per week, mothers who attend
less than once per week, and mothers who never attend.
Analysis
We begin by describing the sample characteristics and
comparing the rate of constant, postpartum and non-
smoking for each category of our predictor variables. Then
we use multinomial logistic regression to predict the risk of
being a constant or resumer smoker relative to non-smok-
ing for each set of predictor variables. Four models sepa-
rately test the combined effects of each set of predictor
variables, and a fifth model includes all variables, in order
to assess the importance of each set of factors in explaining
maternal smoking behavior. We used Stata/SE version 11
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) for all
statistical analyses.
Results
Table 1 shows the sample distributions of the socioeco-
nomic, healthcare, life course and health, and partner and
social support measures used in this study (see column 1),
as well as the bivariate distributions of smoking status by
mothers' characteristics (see columns 2­4). All variables
included in our analysis are significantly associated with
smoking status, based on chi-square tests of equal distri-
butions. That is, the distribution of smoking status for
mothers defined by the different characteristics identified in
the table is significantly different from the distribution that
would be expected if smoking were independent of these
characteristics. In general, the table shows that mothers
with greater disadvantage--i.e., younger mothers who have
less education, who live in households below the poverty
level, who receive late or no prenatal care, who have public
or no health insurance, who have a mental health problem,
who report parenting stress, who did not breastfeed, who
are unmarried, whose partners smoke, who do not attend
religious services, and whose partners suggested an abor-
tion--are more likely to be constant or postpartum smokers
than mothers who fall in the more advantaged categories
across these characteristics.
One exception to this general rule is race/ethnicity.
Mirroring the national pattern, the highest rates of constant
smoking are among the generally more advantaged non-
Hispanic white women. Non-Hispanic black women have
lower rates of smoking than non-Hispanic white women,
and rates of smoking are even lower among Hispanic
women.
Table 1 also shows a second predominant pattern with
several interesting exceptions. For most women, constant
smoking is more prevalent than postpartum smoking.
Among all mothers in the sample, for example, 17% are
constant smokers, and 10% are postpartum smokers. This
pattern is true for white women, black women, and
regardless of education level, poverty status, prenatal care,

and whether the father suggested an abortion.
However, the pattern of constant and postpartum
smoking is different for Hispanic mothers, for mothers who
breastfeed for at least 5 months, and for married mothers,
among whom postpartum smoking is more common than
constant smoking. About one in ten US-born Mexican­
American and other Hispanic women are constant smokers,
but 15% of these women are postpartum smokers. Foreign-
born Mexican­American women have very low rates of
smoking overall, but as with US-born Mexican­American
and other Hispanic women, they are more likely to be
postpartum than constant smokers (4 vs. 1.5%). Among
married mothers and those who breastfed for at least
5 months, about 8% are postpartum smokers, whereas only
6% of married mothers and 7% of mothers who breastfed
for at least 5 months are constant smokers. Although the
rate of postpartum smoking among married mothers and
long-term breastfeeders is not substantially higher than the
rate of constant smoking, and it is lower than the rate of
postpartum smoking among unmarried and short-term or
non-breastfeeders, the important point is that the pattern is
different. This different pattern may point to women who
are effectively ``reached'' by health messages regarding
smoking during pregnancy, and who adjust their behavior
accordingly (i.e., stop smoking) during pregnancy, but not
necessarily afterwards.
A final pattern to note in Table 1 is that constant
smoking varies more with socioeconomic and psychosocial
factors than does postpartum smoking. For example, 9.6%
of mothers with a college education are constant smokers,
compared to 23.1% of mothers with less than a high school
education, a more than 100% difference. By comparison,
8.4% of mothers with a college education are postpartum
smokers, compared to 12.8% of mothers with a less than
high school education, a 50% difference. Similarly, the rate
of constant smoking is twice as high for mothers who are
below the poverty line versus 300% above the poverty line,
who have public versus private insurance, and who never
attend church versus attend weekly, and it is more than
three times as high for mothers who are not in a romantic
relationship with the infant's father (versus married) and
whose infant's father smokes (versus doesn't smoke). By
comparison, with the exception of fathers who smoke (in
which case the difference is over 100%), the difference in
rates of postpartum smoking across these same categories
are never greater than 50%. This is the first piece of evi-
dence that the profile of constant smokers is easier to
identify than the profile of resumer, or postpartum,
smokers.
Table 2 shows results from multinomial logistic
regression equations predicting constant and postpartum
smoking relative to non-smoking. In Models 1 through four
we examine the effects of each separate set of variables on
smoking. The associations correspond to those reported in
Table 1, and in Models 1­4 they are almost all statistically
significant. In Model 5, which includes all variables, pov-
erty is no longer significantly or substantially associated
with smoking. This suggests that the distribution and
association of other factors--health care, life course and
health, and partner and social support--with smoking sta-
tus explains the higher risk of smoking among impover-
ished mothers.
All models show a similar pattern of stronger and more
statistically significant associations for constant smoking
than for postpartum smoking, the second piece of evidence
that the profile of constant smokers is more easily identi-
fiable. For example, less than high school education is
associated with a four-fold increase in the risk of constant
smoking relative to non-smoking, compared to a 94%
increase in the risk of postpartum smoking relative to non-
smoking. In the full model, all but four measures have
statistically significant associations with constant-smoking,
whereas fewer than half of all measures are statistically
significantly associated with postpartum smoking.
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that among postpartum
mothers, there is a much clearer risk profile for constant
smokers (those who smoked during pregnancy and con-
tinued to smoke at 1 year postpartum) than there is for
mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy but became
postpartum smokers. Disadvantage in terms of the various
psychosocial factors we measured, including measures of
socioeconomic status, health care, life course and maternal
health, and partner and social support, was more predictive
of constant smoking than of postpartum smoking. The
prevalence of constant smoking is nearly universally higher
than the prevalence of postpartum smoking. In other words,
post-partum smokers--mothers who abstain from smoking
during pregnancy but begin or resume smoking in the post-
partum period--are less common and harder to identify
than mothers who smoke during and after pregnancy.
Psychosocial factors have a strong effect in predicting
smoking that persists through pregnancy and the post-
partum period. Mothers diagnosed with or prescribed
medication for a mental health problem within the previous
year are more likely to smoke during pregnancy and con-
tinue to do so after childbirth. Mothers who report high
levels of parenting stress are also more likely to be constant
smokers, but the relationship is explained by socioeco-
nomic standing, health status, and access to social support.
Mothers who are not married and mothers who never

attend church, suggesting less access to social support, also
have a higher likelihood of constant smoking. Finally,
mothers are more likely to be constant smokers if the
baby's father is also a smoker. While these factors play a
role for mothers who smoke during the postpartum period
but did not smoke during pregnancy, the relationship is
much weaker.
Another important finding of the study concerns racial
and ethnic patterns in the trajectory of maternal smoking.
Overall, slightly over a quarter of mothers smoked fol-
lowing the birth of the child. As expected, mothers who
smoked during the pregnancy also tend to continue
smoking after their child's birth. Sixty percent of the
postpartum smokers had smoked during their pregnancy,
while 40% of the mothers who smoked during the post-
partum period had not smoked during the pregnancy.
Hispanic mothers, however, showed a reversal in this
pattern. Hispanic mothers are more likely to be postpartum
smokers than they are to be constant smokers, in contrast to
White and Black women who are more likely to have
smoked throughout their pregnancies. This is important
because it appears that the low smoking rates among this
population, which are so closely associated with healthier
birth outcomes [17], may be eroded subsequent to the birth
of their child.
The results can be interpreted two ways. One is that it is
easier to identify or predict who will be a constant smoker
and thus target interventions for these more entrenched
smokers. On the other hand, it seems more difficult to
identify who is at risk for postpartum smoking and thus we
may miss an opportunity to intervene during this key per-
iod, while mothers are likely to be in contact with the
pediatric health care system. Furthermore, Hispanic
women, married women, and women who breastfeed for at
least 5 months are more likely to smoke during the post-
partum period in spite of having refrained from smoking
during pregnancy. This suggests that the mitigating effects
of prenatal care, social support, and cultural factors on
smoking abstention during pregnancy may not extend as
easily to the postpartum period. Healthcare providers may
need to provide ongoing education and support for this
particular group of women, in addition to women who
engage in the more deleterious behavior of smoking both
during and after pregnancy.
Although the study uncovers patterns not previously
observed, we recognize some important data limitations.
First, our study is based on maternal self-reports of
smoking behaviors. The rate in our study of 18.8% prenatal
smoking is higher than the 9­17% range based on national
estimates [18], at least suggesting that the usual pattern of
underreporting smoking is not a concern among this sam-
ple of predominantly unmarried, urban mothers. Maternal
self-reports of smoking in the Fragile Families data used in
this study are comparable to data obtained from the sup-
plemental medical records gathered at delivery from the
mothers in the Fragile Families sample [19]. However, a
recent study comparing data gathered at two different times
showed that maternal reports can vary significantly
depending on when the question is asked. Allen and col-
laborators [20] compared data from birth certificates based
on maternal medical records and information obtained
from the mother at delivery and a self-administered ques-
tionnaire mailed approximately 2­3 months after delivery
to a subsample of mothers from the birth certificates. The
authors estimated that prenatal smoking may be as much as
31% higher than what is reported at delivery.
Second, we do not have information on pre-pregnancy
smoking. Thus, we do not know if mothers who did not
smoke during pregnancy but do so afterwards are resuming
previous smoking behavior or beginning to smoke for the
first time in the postpartum period. We also do not know if
mothers who smoked throughout the pregnancy and
beyond had a history of smoking prior to their pregnancy.
Finally, because our focus is on disadvantaged, mostly
unmarried mothers, comparisons with married and gener-
ally more advantaged women are necessary to determine
patterns in the general population. In spite of these limi-
tations, the study allows us to explore risk factors previ-
ously unavailable in the study of postpartum smoking.
Clearly, maternal and child health are closely inter-
twined, and thus a healthy pregnancy is of great concern
for the health of newborns. Indeed, our findings show that
the incidence of smoking among pregnant women is well
above the Healthy People 2010 target of 1% or less [21].
However, the significance of the mother's health beyond
the pregnancy period should not be overlooked. A number
of researchers have suggested the need for maternal health
care to extend beyond the traditional 6 week mark [1, 22,
23]. Such an approach would allow health care providers
the opportunity to implement health promotion strategies
and interventions to improve women's overall health and
address continuing morbidities [22].
