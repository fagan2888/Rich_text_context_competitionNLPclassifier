We investigated mental health and cognitive function in 195 community-dwelling adults aged 18 to 92 years (M =
46.64). We assessed several cognitive domains, including psychomotor, executive function, and episodic memory.
We found a significant Age 3 Mental Health interaction in relation to within-person (WP) variability (trial-to-
trial variability in reaction time performance) in a four-choice psychomotor task and a Stroop task, but not in
relation to mean reaction time measures from those tasks. Poorer mental health was associated with greater WP
variability in older adults. We did not find this effect in relation to memory. The findings suggest that measures of
WP variability may be sensitive to relatively subtle effects associated with age and poor mental health, and that
they provide valuable insights into cognitive function in old age.
Key Words: Intraindividual--Variability--Depression--Anxiety.
ALTHOUGH investigation of reaction time (RT) mean
performance for a given cognitive task can provide
valuable information, there are good reasons to consider the
within-person (WP) variability of RTs across trials of that task.
The suggestion that WP variability (also referred to as intrain-
dividual variability) is indicative of neurobiological disturbance
or decline (Hendrickson, 1982; Hultsch & MacDonald, 2004;
Li & Lindenberger, 1999) is supported by an accumulating body
of research. For example, WP variability is greater with older
age (e.g., Anstey, 1999; Bunce, MacDonald, & Hultsch, 2004;
Hultsch, MacDonald, & Dixon, 2002; West, Murphy, Armilio,
Craik, & Stuss, 2002), and also in relation to a range of con-
ditions involving some form of neurobiological disturbance (see
MacDonald, Ba
¨ckman, & Nyberg, 2006, for review). Relative to
matched controls, WP variability is greater in the presence of
mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (Christensen et al.,
2005; Hultsch, MacDonald, Hunter, Levy-Bencheton, &
Strauss, 2000; Strauss, Bielak, Bunce, Hunter, & Hultsch,
2007), traumatic brain injury (e.g., Stuss, Murphy, Binns, &
Alexander, 2003; Stuss, Pogue, Buckle, & Bondar, 1994),
Parkinson's disease (Burton, Strauss, Hultsch, Moll, & Hunter,
2006), and epilepsy (Bruhn & Parsons, 1977). Adding to this
behavioral work, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
work in young adults (Bellgrove, Hester, & Garavan, 2004)
suggests that WP variability in a go­no-go response paradigm
was systematically related to activity in the frontal cortex. A
structural MRI study by Anstey and colleagues (2007) in adults
aged 60 to 64 years found that WP variability was associated
with corpus callosum size in individuals with mild cognitive
disorders but not in individuals in a normative sample. Another
investigation by this group in healthy older adults found that the
extent of frontal white matter lesioning was associated with
measures of WP variability but not with measures of processing
speed (mean RT), memory, or global cognition (Bunce et al.,
2007). Together, this behavioral and brain imaging work sug-
gests that WP variability (a) reflects neurobiological disturbance
or decline and (b) is associated with systematic brain activity or
structures in the frontal cortex.
As research suggests that measures of WP variability may
reflect disease pathology that involves the central nervous
system, in the present study we addressed questions that have
received little attention to date. That is, how far are measures of
WP variability sensitive to mild psychopathology? Does age
have any bearing on associations where they exist? Specifically,
we were interested in the possibility that persons experiencing
poor mental health in the form of mild depression or anxiety,
social dysfunction, and loss of confidence, although functioning
apparently normally in their everyday lives, were more variable
in their responding than were persons unaffected by such mild
psychopathology. Additionally, it was important to assess
whether age had any bearing on these associations.
Theoretically, there are both cognitive and neurobiological
reasons to expect depression or anxiety, and relatedly, social
dysfunction and loss of confidence, to affect cognitive
performance. Cognitive perspectives draw largely on resource
theory (e.g., Kahneman, 1973), and they emphasize attentional
resource reductions and task-irrelevant thoughts. Specifically,
the cognitive capacity available to process information may be
reduced (but not eliminated) in depressed persons, and this
together with the tendency to deploy the remaining resources
toward depression-related thoughts results in cognitive deficits,
particularly in more effortful processing (Hartlage, Alloy,
Vazquez, & Dykman, 1993). Similarly, elevated anxiety may
affect cognitive performance by detrimentally influencing ex-
ecutive control mechanisms, and working memory in particular,
such that reduced information-processing capacity and effi-
ciency results (e.g., Eysenck & Calvo, 1992).
Neurobiological accounts include the glucocorticoid hypoth-
esis (e.g., Sapolsky, 1999), which suggests that elevated stress
levels trigger the secretion of glucocorticoids. Although this
may serve beneficially in adapting to acute stressors, longer
term secretion may be harmful to the nervous system, particu-

larly the hippocampus. Empirically, several studies have dem-
onstrated cortisol-related deficits in memory (e.g., Lupien &
McEwen, 1997) and also global cognition (Magri et al., 2006).
Research has also identified a high density of corticosteroid
receptors in the frontal lobes (Murros, Fogelholm, Kettunen, &
Vuorela, 1993), the brain structure held to support executive
function (Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000). As glucocorticoid exposure
increases in old age (Sapolsky, 1999), and anxiety and depres-
sion frequently occur together, this raises the possibility that
older persons experiencing anxiety or depression may be at
greater risk of cognitive deficits, particularly in domains reliant
on frontal systems. This possibility was underlined by recent
work (Stawski, Sliwinski, & Smyth, 2006) showing stress-
related cognitive interference to be associated with poorer
performance on working memory and episodic memory tasks
in older adults, and also research suggesting measures of
executive function to account for depression-related cognitive
deficits in older adults (Elderkin-Thompson, Mintz, Haroon,
Lavretsky, & Kumar, 2006; Sheline et al., 2006).
Although studies exist that suggest an association between
mental health and WP variability, the amount of research in
the area is limited. For instance, a recent investigation found
a significant positive association between WP variability and
negative affect in college students recording higher neuroticism
scores (Robinson, Wilkowski, & Meier, 2006). A further study
at the WP level that took age into account examined day-to-day
variability in stress and WP variability among young adults
aged 18 to 24 years, and older adults aged 66 to 96 years
(Sliwinski, Smyth, Hofer, & Stawski, 2006). For a two-back
working memory task, a significant Stress 3 RT interaction
suggested that higher WP stress was associated with slower, but
not faster, RTs. Although there was a trend suggesting this
effect was stronger in older adults, it was not significant.
Together, even though these investigations point to an asso-
ciation between poor mental health and intraindividual vari-
ability, it remains unclear as to whether this effect is stronger in
older adults relative to younger adults, and also whether
measures of WP variability reveal associations when mean RT
measures do not.
In the present study, we recorded self-reports of mental
health through the 12-item General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-12; Goldberg, 1978). The original 60-item GHQ was
developed to measure general health and included items
relating to both psychiatric and somatic complaints. A shorter
12-item version was later developed that specifically assesses
minor psychiatric disorders relating to state (rather than trait)
feelings. Research investigating the factor structure of this
version (e.g., Weneke, Goldberg, Yalcin, & U
¨ stu
¨n, 2000; also
see Ma
¨kikangas et al., 2006) suggests the scale to measure
constructs relating to anxiety and depression, social dysfunc-
tion, and loss of confidence. The measure has been used exten-
sively in various settings, and it effectively identifies persons
who would be classified as suffering a minor psychiatric
disorder (see Goldberg et al., 1997). Importantly from the
present perspective, a study in 5,438 persons (Goldberg et al.)
showed that age did not affect the scale's validity.
In addition, a correlation of 0.69 was reported between the
GHQ-12 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory in an outpatient
sample with anxiety disorders (Gao et al., 2004), and our own
work in a community-based sample (Bond & Bunce, 2000)
produced a mean correlation of 0.54 over four time points with
the Beck Depression Inventory. On the basis of earlier research,
we predicted that poor mental health, as recorded by the GHQ,
would be associated with poorer cognitive performance.
Because of the well-established evidence of age-related changes
in the frontal cortex (Raz & Rodrigue, 2006; West, 1996) and the
theoretical rationale presented earlier whereby the mechanisms
by which stress and depression affected cognitive function
involved frontal regions and, relatedly, executive processes, we
expected that associations, where they existed, would be par-
ticularly strong in older adults.
We chose our cognitive variables to measure specific
cognitive domains. We were particularly interested in psycho-
motor performance, because earlier studies (Bunce et al., 2004;
MacDonald, Hultsch, & Bunce, 2006) have shown that older
adults exhibit a greater response variability in such tasks. Our
first aim was to compare standard measures of mean RT with
WP variability metrics while taking age and mental health into
account. Was it the case that measures of WP variability were
sensitive to subtle, but nonetheless important, effects that more
commonly used metrics were not? Our second aim, given the
empirical research described earlier, was to assess episodic
memory and executive function in the expectation that they too
would be sensitive to Age 3 Mental Health associations.
Indeed, as theoretical accounts of the mechanisms by which
mental health influences cognition commonly suggest frontally
modulated or executive control mechanisms, we reasoned that
where Age 3 Mental Health associations were found in relation
to memory and psychomotor tasks, they would be accounted
for by independent measures of executive function. Our third
aim, therefore, was to test this possibility.
METHODS
Participants
Through local organizations (e.g., bridge clubs) and re-
searcher contacts, we recruited healthy persons living in the
community for the study. During the initial screening,
participants provided details of their health (including psychi-
atric conditions) and medications. Two persons reported
neurological conditions (Parkinson's disease and minor stroke);
we did not test them further. The remaining 195 persons (53%
women, 47% men) were between 18 and 92 years of age (M ¼
46.64, SD ¼ 19.10). We screened those individuals older than
65 years for cognitive impairment by using the Mini-Mental
State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). In
this study, we included only those individuals recording a score
of 26 or higher on that examination. Apart from conditions
typically found in older persons (e.g., blood pressure or prostate
problems), all participants were free of major health or mental
health disorders. None reported using antidepressants. We
measured verbal IQ through the National Adult Reading Test
(NART; Nelson, 1982), and here we report estimated full-scale
IQ (M ¼ 116.46, SD ¼ 8.49). For each decade, descriptive data
for biographical, NART, and GHQ variables are presented in
Table 1.

Mental Health
GHQ-12. --The GHQ-12 (Goldberg, 1978) is a 12-item scale
that assesses mental health through various questions (e.g.,
Have you recently. . . ``lost much sleep over worry,'' ``felt that
you couldn't overcome your difficulties,'' ``been losing
confidence in yourself''). We utilized the widely used Likert
method of scoring, in which each item was scored 0 (not at all)
to 3 (much more than usual). We report the scale mean, in
which higher scores indicate poorer mental health. A Cronbach
alpha of a ¼ .89 suggested that internal consistency was good
for this scale.
Cognitive Tasks
Episodic memory. --We created a list of 40 semantically
unrelated nouns (frequency, M ¼ 126.50). At study, we had 20
target words presented at a rate of 5 s per word on a personal
computer (PC) screen. At test following several other tasks, we
had the 20 target words randomly intermixed with 20 distracter
words and individually presented on the PC screen for 5 s each.
Researchers instructed the participants to respond ``yes'' for
target words and ``no'' for distracter words by using designated
keyboard keys. We recorded the hits and false alarms. In order
to take response bias into account, here we report on adjusted
hits (i.e., hits minus false alarms).
Executive function. --Recent research suggests that executive
function is characterized as involving separable but related
processes of switching between mental sets, monitoring and
updating working memory, and inhibiting prepotent responses
(Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, & Howerter, 2000).
Therefore, we selected our measures of executive function to
reflect these constructs. For switching, we used the Alternate
Category Task (Parkin, Walter, & Hunkin, 1995), which
required the alternate generation of as many unique animal and
country names as possible within 1 minute. We awarded a point
for each successful animal­country switch. We summed the
points to give a total score that reflected set-switching
performance.
For updating, we presented 105 digits from 1 to 9 individ-
ually on a PC screen at a rate of 1 s each. Embedded at random
intervals were 11 strings of three odd numbers. We instructed
participants to press the keyboard spacebar each time they
detected a string of three odd numbers. Thus, for each digit
presentation, the individual had to update working memory in
order to detect three continuous odd-number presentations. We
recorded the correct detections (hits) and false alarms. Here, in
order to take response bias into account, we report adjusted hits
as a summary measure of updating working memory.
For inhibition, we used a version of the Stroop color­word
task administered on a PC as a measurement. Participants were
required to respond to the ink color (red, blue, yellow, or green)
of the printed words red, blue, yellow, and green by using the
appropriate keyboard key. We administered 16 practice trials,
followed by 96 pseudorandomized test trials, half of which
were congruent (word­color matched) and half of which were
incongruent (word­color not matched). We computed measures
of mean RT and WP variability for this task (see the paragraphs
that follow).
Psychomotor. --We administered two-choice RT (2-CRT)
and four-choice RT (4-CRT) tasks by means of a PC. In the
two-choice version of the task, a black disk (0.5 cm in
diameter) was presented pseudorandomly either left or right of
a central fixation cross. In the four-choice version of the task,
the black disk appeared in one of four locations (lower or upper
left or right). Participants were required to press designated
keyboard keys that mapped spatially onto the position of the
disk on the screen as quickly but as accurately as possible. We
counterbalanced the tasks across participants, and in each
condition we administered 20 practice trials prior to 100 test
trials.
Computation of Mean RT and WP Variability
For correct trials of the Stroop and 2-CRT and 4-CRT tasks
we computed mean RT, and the intraindividual standard
deviation (ISD) as a measure of WP variability, following the
procedures of Hultsch and colleagues (2002). We inspected
data distributions for the respective tasks for any extremely fast
or slow latencies that may reflect various sources of error (e.g.,
accidental key presses, task interruption). In order to eliminate
such trials, we set a lower boundary of 150 ms, and an upper
boundary of the individual mean RT þ 3 SD, beyond which
trials were excluded. We replaced the eliminated RTs with the
age group mean RT for that particular task. For the Stroop task,
no trials were replaced at the lower bound, but for the upper
bound, 1.56% and 1.25% of trials, respectively, for the
congruent and incongruent conditions were replaced. For 2-
CRT and 4-CRT tasks, 3.00% and 1.80% of trials, respectively,
were replaced for this reason. As removing outliers and
replacing missing values in this way reduces variability, the

procedure represents a conservative approach to the study of
WP variability.
For each task, we computed mean RT from the raw correct
response latencies, and for WP variability, we computed the
ISD. Because the raw ISD increases in direct relation to
age-related increases in RT, it is appropriate to statistically
partial out such systematic age differences from ISD measures.
Otherwise, larger ISDs are confounded by older adults' slower
responding relative to that of younger adults. Similarly, trial-to-
trial variance may reflect learning effects, or other systematic
time-on-task influences. Therefore, we used a regression pro-
cedure (Hultsch et al., 2002) to partial out the effects of
chronological age, and trial-related (i.e., trial number) variation
in responding from ISDs, and their higher order interaction.
Specifically, we regressed RTs on chronological age (entered
as a continuous variable) and trial number to produce residuals
that were statistically independent of differences stemming
from either of those sources. We then converted the residual
scores to t scores (M ¼ 50, SD ¼10) to facilitate comparisons
across tasks, and then we used them to compute ISDs. As
nonsignificant correlations between GHQ and mean RT sug-
gested that RTs did not vary according to GHQ (see Table 2),
we did not enter GHQ scores into this procedure.
For the Stroop task, as congruent and incongruent conditions
for the respective measures were highly correlated (mean RT ¼
0.93; WP variability ¼ 0.82), we computed the mean of the
two conditions as summary measures of mean RT and WP
variability.
Missing Data
Across the 195 participants, for missing data on a minority of
variables (i.e., updating¼2.1%, inhibition¼0.5%), we imputed
values with the EM algorithm in SPSS by using all of the
variables in the present study (see Shafer & Graham, 2002).
RESULTS
Bivariate correlations together with means and standard
deviations for the respective variables are presented in Table 2.
In most cases, age correlated with the cognitive variables in the
direction expected. Older age was significantly associated with
lower recognition scores, slower RTs, and greater WP
variability. Older age was also associated with higher NART
scores. There were associations between executive function and
WP variability in the direction expected; higher switching
scores were significantly correlated with lower variability in
both the 2-CRT and 4-CRT tasks, and also the Stroop task. In
addition, higher updating scores were significantly associated
with lower variability in the 4-CRT task. The correlation
between age and GHQ scores was nonsignificant. Correlations
between GHQ and cognitive variables were predominantly
nonsignificant, the exception being that higher GHQ scores
were associated with greater WP variability in the 4-CRT task.
Associations between gender and the other variables were all
nonsignificant.
We used a series of hierarchical multiple regression models
to explore the relationship between age, mental health, and the
cognitive variables. As NART scores were associated with both
age and several of the cognitive measures, we computed all of
the models having adjusted for that variable at Step 1. This
procedure controls for the possibility that age differences in
IQ underlie age differences in the cognitive variables, and,
therefore, act as a confound. At Step 2, we entered chrono-
logical age and GHQ scores, followed by the Age 3 GHQ
cross-product interaction term at Step 3. It is important that, if
Step 3 significantly added to the variance (R2) explained in the
cognitive variable having taken age and GHQ scores into
account, then it would suggest that the strength of association
between mental health and cognitive function varied according
to age. As a result of the number of regression models
examined, we set alpha conservatively at p , .01.
The results of the hierarchical multiple regressions are
presented in Table 3. At Step 2, the beta weights suggest that
the respective associations between age and GHQ scores and
the other variables did not differ greatly from the bivariate
correlations reported in Table 2. Age independently predicted
Stroop and 4-CRT intraindividual variability. Of particular
interest, though, was Step 3, where the Age 3 GHQ cross-
product interaction term was entered. For the majority of
variables, entry of this term did not add significantly to the
variance explained in the cognitive measures. However, for the
WP variability in the Stroop and 4-CRT tasks, that interaction

term was significant. In both instances, the equivalent inter-
actions for mean RT were nonsignificant (ps . .90). Regression
lines for the significant interaction terms are presented in Figure
1. Although the Stroop task exhibited greater variability overall,
in both tasks, for persons with low GHQ scores, greater age is
not associated with a marked increase in WP variability.
Importantly, however, for individuals recording higher GHQ
scores, not only is WP variability greater, but the degree of
variability increases with older age. In other words, poorer
mental health is having a greater impact on the response
variability of older persons.
It is of note that the significant Age 3 GHQ interaction was
found for ISDs in the more demanding 4-CRT task and not for
the two-choice version of the task. As this may reflect
a selective effect related to task demands (i.e., the increase
from two to four choices), we repeated the regression model,
but this time we controlled for 2-CRT ISD at Step 1. This made
no difference to our original finding. As this procedure effec-
tively controls for the WP variability attributable to the two-
choice task and leaves residuals reflecting the increase from two
to four response choices, the finding supports the view that it is
WP variability in the more effortful psychomotor condition that
is particularly sensitive to Age 3 Mental Health relations.
We also wished to confirm that our regression procedure for
removing age and time-on-task influences on RT from ISD
metrics had been successful and had no bearing on the current
findings. Therefore, we repeated the regression models for
Stroop and 4-CRT ISDs, but this time we controlled for the
respective mean RT measures at Step 1. Although in both cases
the first-order effects for age and GHQ were attenuated, the
Age 3 GHQ interactions were unaffected (Stroop ÁR2 ¼ .03,
p , .01; 4-CRT ÁR2 ¼ .03, p , .01); this suggests that the
effects for WP variability were independent of mean RT.
Finally, our further aim in this study was to assess if the
independent measures of executive function accounted for
significant Age 3 GHQ interactions where they were found.
This was of particular interest, given (a) the finding of
a significant Age 3 GHQ interaction in respect to Stroop and
4-CRT ISDs, and (b) the theoretical role of executive control in
mental health­cognition relations, and also in explanations of
WP variability. Therefore, we ran a further series of regression
models for Stroop and 4-CRT ISDs, but, respectively, we
controlled at Step 1 for switching, updating, and, in the case
of 4-CRT, inhibition. If the respective executive function
measures accounted for the associations found in the original
models, then the effect size of the Age 3 GHQ interaction
would be attenuated in these repeated analyses. When adjusting
for switching and updating, we found that only marginal
attenuation occurred (for 4-CRT controlling for switching,
ÁR2 ¼ .03, p , .01; for updating, ÁR2 ¼ .03, p , .01; for
Stroop controlling for switching, ÁR2 ¼ .03, p ¼ .012; for
updating, ÁR2 ¼ .03, p , .01). However, when examining
4-CRT ISDs having controlled for Stroop ISDs, we found that
R2 was markedly attenuated (ÁR2 ¼ .01, p . .06). This latter
finding suggests that variability in inhibition is accounting for
some of the Age 3 GHQ-related variability in 4-CRT.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate age,
mental health, and WP variability in a continuous age range
spanning young adulthood to persons in their early 90s. The
work extends research describing an association between
intraindividual variability and neurological disorders, and it
suggests that having mild mental health problems (i.e.,
depression and anxiety, social dysfunction, loss of confidence)
in old age is associated with variability in cognitive per-
formance. Several important findings were produced. First,
although the association between mental health and cognitive
function did not vary according to age for the majority of
variables, significant Age3GHQ interactions were produced in
relation to WP variability in the Stroop and 4-CRT tasks.
Poorer mental health and older age were associated with greater
variability. Importantly, a dissociation was evident, as measures
of mean RT for those variables were not similarly related to age
and mental health. Second, the association for 4-CRT remained
even when we controlled for the two-choice equivalent of this
measure, suggesting the effect was selective to the more
effortful task condition. Finally, the significant Age 3 Mental
Health interaction in relation to 4-CRT WP variability was
accounted for by executive function measures of inhibition, but
not by switching or updating. Overall, the findings were
unrelated to gender, and they were independent of verbal IQ.
The present findings build on earlier research at the WP level
that found a weak but nonsignificant association between age,
day-to-day stress, and variability (Sliwinski et al., 2006). It is

MENTAL HEALTH AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN ADULTS P71
important that the dissociations found here suggest that
variability measures may be sensitive to relatively subtle
effects of age and mild mental health problems, whereas
measures of mean RT are not. This sensitivity to mild effects is
underlined by the observation that persons aged 18 to 29, 30 to
39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 65 years recorded mean GHQ scores in
line with functioning community-dwelling persons in those age
bands elsewhere (Mullarkey, Wall, Warr, Clegg, & Stride,
1999). This suggests that participants were representative of the
normal population and were not experiencing major mental
health problems.
The reason for the dissociation with mean RT measures may
be related to the finding that increased WP variability is largely
due to a greater proportion of slower responses falling into the
tail of the individual's RT distribution (e.g., Spieler, Balota, &
Faust, 1996; West et al., 2002). It has been suggested that this
may represent fluctuations in executive control (Bunce et al.,
2004; West et al.) or, relatedly, attentional lapses (Bunce,
Warr, & Cochrane, 1993), although this latter view has been
questioned (Salthouse, 1993). It was noted earlier that attentional
resources may be reduced in depression, and that task-irrelevant
depressive thoughts may result in cognitive deficits, particularly
in more effortful processing (Hartlage et al., 1993). As the
cognitive effects of depression are modulated by frontally
supported executive processes, and as fluctuations in these
processes are thought to underlie WP variability, it is plausible
that measures of intraindividual variability are more sensitive to
the deleterious influence of poor mental health at a lower
threshold than mean RT measures. Had our participants been
experiencing greater mental health problems, we would expect
measures of mean RT to capture Age 3 GHQ associations too.
The present dissociations underline the possibility that WP
variability is a particularly sensitive behavioral marker of
cognitive or neurobiological disturbance. Indeed, regarding the
latter point, recent research (Bunce et al., 2007) has shown that,
in a relatively young (60­64 years) group of healthy older adults,
that white matter lesioning of the frontal cortex is related to WP
variability, but not mean RT, for the same psychomotor task.
This work, together with the findings of the present study, clearly
suggests that measures of WP variability have the potential to
detect associations or conditions in circumstances where more
commonly used measures of accuracy and mean RT do not.
Therefore, the measures may provide a valuable addition to
screening and assessment batteries in health care settings.
Two further aims of the study were to assess how far
executive function and memory varied as a function of age and
mental health, and also to establish if findings for WP variability
were accounted for by measures of executive control. Although
there was no evidence that memory varied according to age and
mental health, our research did show that, consistent with
research elsewhere (e.g., Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2006;
Sheline et al., 2006), executive function was associated with
mental health-related cognitive deficits in older adults. Specif-
ically, we found a significant Age3Mental Health interaction in
respect to inhibition, but not in relation to measures of switching
and updating. This finding is consistent with the view that
a failure to inhibit intrusive thoughts related to depression and
anxiety, social dysfunction, and loss of confidence underlies
mental-health-related cognitive deficits, and that reduced
attentional resources in old age exacerbates this effect.
This interpretation was underlined by the additional finding
that the Age 3 GHQ interaction in respect to 4-CRT variability
was substantially attenuated when we controlled for variability in
the Stroop task, our measure of inhibition. One should exercise
caution when interpreting this latter finding, however, because of
statistical concerns relating to variance-partitioning procedures,
and population mean confounds, in cross-sectional samples (e.g.,
Hofer & Sliwinski, 2001; Lindenberger & Po
¨tter, 1998;
Sliwinski & Hofer, 1999). Furthermore, consideration of Table
2 suggests that the respective measures of executive function
were weakly correlated, and Table 3 indicates there was little
shared variance between age and both switching and updating.
As these findings were unexpected, it raises the possibility that
the present measures did not capture those constructs with
Figure 1. Regression lines for the Age 3 GHQ interaction in
relation to (a) four-choice reaction time within-person variability, and
(b) Stroop within-person variability (GHQ ¼ General Health
Questionnaire-12; ISD ¼ intraindividual standard deviation).

sufficient rigor and that alternative measures should be
considered for future research. Despite these limitations, though,
we believe the findings relating to the measure of inhibition have
potentially important theoretical implications that should be
investigated further through longitudinal research.
There are several further limitations to the present study that
we should acknowledge. First, as noted, cross-sectional data
were used, and therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions
concerning causality. Second, although the finding of a signif-
icant Age3GHQ interaction in relation to WP variability in the
4-CRT but not the 2-CRT task suggests that it is during more
effortful processing, which places greater demands on execu-
tive control, that mental health­cognition effects are strongest,
we did not independently measure the perceived workload
associated with the respective tasks. Therefore, we cannot
confirm that an increase in perceived demands occurred, and
accordingly, that interpretation should be treated with appro-
priate caution. Finally, although the GHQ possesses good
psychometric properties and is widely used as a measure of
mental health (Goldberg et al., 1997), the short version we used
does not specifically delineate between anxiety and depression.
Therefore, although we can assume that participants recording
higher GHQ scores were experiencing elevated anxiety or
depression, it is not possible to say which. Current work in our
laboratories involving an independent sample of adults
distinguishes between those mental health constructs and will
shed light on this issue.
To conclude, the finding of significant Age 3 Mental Health
interactions in respect to WP variability, but not measures of
mean RT, raises the possibility that moment-to-moment
fluctuations in information processing may characterize the
influence of poor mental health on cognition in older persons.
This finding not only is of theoretical interest but also suggests
that measures of WP variability are sensitive to relatively
subtle, but nonetheless important, mental-health-related effects
that may be masked in other metrics and cognitive measures.
As the present study builds on research suggesting that
measures of WP variability and mean RT dissociate in the
presence of possible disease pathology, it is plausible that
measures of WP variability may not only provide valuable
theoretical insights but also have considerable potential for
assessment and diagnostic purposes in health care contexts. It is
important for future research to explore this potential further.
