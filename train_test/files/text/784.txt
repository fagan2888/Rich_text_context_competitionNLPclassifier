BRIEF REPORT
Factors Associated With Food Insecurity Among
U.S. Elderly Persons: Importance of
Functional Impairments
Jung Sun Lee and Edward A. Frongillo, Jr.
Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.
Objectives. The authors examined factors associated with the food insecurity of elderly persons in the United
States and particularly how functional impairments were associated with food insecurity.
Methods. Data were from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­94) and the Nutri-
tion Survey of the Elderly in New York State (1994). The authors used multiple logistic regression and a hierarchical lo-
gistic regression analyses to examine how functional impairments as well as sociodemographic and economic factors
contributed to food insecurity in elderly persons.
Results. Low income, low education, minority status, food assistance program participation, and social isolation
were significantly related with food insecurity. Functional impairments were significantly related with food insecurity
among elderly persons even after those factors were controlled.
Discussion. Food security in elderly persons is associated with functional impairments, suggesting that food insecu-
rity in elderly persons comprises not only limited food affordability, availability, and accessibility but also altered food
use. Food-insecure elderly persons experience multiple problems that prevent them from achieving nutritional well-being
and seeking food assistance programs. Nutrition services should recognize and provide services to cover those needs.
UNGER and food insecurity are a persistent problem
in the United States (Alaimo, Briefel, Frongillo, & Ol-
son, 1998; Burt, 1993; Hamilton et al., 1997; Nord, Jemison, &
Bickel, 1999; President's Task Force in Food Assistance,
1984; Wehler, Scott, & Anderson, 1995). The relation of
food insecurity to poor nutritional and health status, as well
as the ethical unacceptability of its presence within our soci-
ety, has drawn significant efforts to understand the nature,
extent, and prevention of food insecurity in the past decade
(Campbell, 1991; Eisinger, 1998). These efforts culminated
in the development of the first national food insecurity and
hunger module in the Current Population Survey (CPS),
which researchers designed to further understand and moni-
tor food insecurity in the United States (Rose, 1999).
One gap in current understanding is the nature of food in-
security among elderly persons, whose number and propor-
tion will dramatically increase through the 21st century.
Most widely accepted definitions and measures of food in-
security in the United States are from research on younger
adults and children. The concept of food insecurity is
mainly focused on limited or uncertain food affordability,
accessibility, and availability due to lack of resources. Pre-
vious research showed that food insecurity is related to so-
ciodemographic and economic conditions that limit the
household resources available for food acquisition (Alaimo
et al., 1998; Campbell, 1991; Hamilton et al., 1997; Nord et al.,
1999; Rose, Gunderson, & Oliveira, 1998).
The current concept of food insecurity has not taken into
account limited or uncertain food use, which has an impor-
tant relevance in elderly persons because their functional im-
pairments and health problems alter ability to use food. Abil-
ity to use food is the ability to prepare, gain access to, and eat
food that is available in the household. Ability to use food is
not the only--but is an essential--component in maintaining
adequate food use in elderly persons, which includes ways in
which individuals prepare foods and combine foods into
dishes, meals, and meal patterns (Quandt, Arcury, & Bell,
1998; Quandt, Vitolins, DeWalt, & Roos, 1997).
Although accurate characterization of food-insecure el-
derly persons has only recently begun, previous research
found that functional impairments, health problems, and lack
of social support have significant relationships with food in-
security (Burt, 1993; Frongillo, Rauschenbach, Roe, & Wil-
liamson, 1992; New York State Department of Health and
Office for the Aging, 1996; Quandt & Rao, 1999; Roe, 1990;
Wolfe, Olson, Kendall, & Frongillo, 1996). These studies
suggest that the concept of food insecurity in elderly persons
may include altered food use (i.e., inability to use food) due
to functional impairments and health problems, as well as in-
adequate availability, affordability, and accessibility of food.
In this study we examined factors associated with food
insecurity in elderly persons and particularly how factors re-
lated to altered food use, as well as inadequate food afford-
ability, availability, and accessibility, contribute to food in-
security among U.S. elderly persons. We hypothesized that
functional impairments were associated with food insecu-
rity independent of other sociodemographic and economic
factors. We used multivariate analysis with nationally and
state representative samples from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­94)
H
FOOD INSECURITY OF U.S. ELDERLY PERSONS S95
and the Nutrition Survey of the Elderly in New York State
(NSENY, 1994). The results will provide a better under-
standing of food insecurity among elderly persons, foster
discussion for better measurement of food insecurity, and
provide information to improve nutrition services to reduce
food insecurity in elderly persons.
METHODS
Data and Study Sample
NHANES III.--Elderly persons aged 60­90 years (N 
6,596) were sampled in NHANES III. The survey was de-
signed to obtain nationally representative information on
health and nutritional status in the U.S. population. Specifi-
cally, NHANES III included aged and very old persons and
used a home examination to provide reliable estimates in
older persons for the first time (McDowell, Harris, &
Briefel, 1991). More detailed information on the survey de-
sign and operation is published elsewhere (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health
Statistics, 1996).
The analytic sample included all individuals who had com-
plete information on food insufficiency, health problems,
physical functioning, sociodemographic, and economic vari-
ables that are described below. Because of missing informa-
tion on food insufficiency, 38 individuals were excluded.
NSENY.--Data were taken from elderly persons aged
60­96 years (N  553) who were sampled in the supple-
mental survey to the NSENY. The NSENY was intended to
obtain information to improve the effectiveness of services
provided by the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) in New
York State. New York State elderly persons have character-
istics that mirror the heterogeneity of the U.S. population
(Frongillo, Williamson, Roe, & Scholes, 1987). A strength
of the NSENY is its inclusion of a wide range of data, such
as sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional screening,
food insecurity, and functional impairment variables. More
detailed information of the survey design, operation, and
questionnaire has been published elsewhere (New York
State Department of Health and Office for the Aging, 1996).
The analytic sample included all individuals who had com-
plete information on food insecurity, nutritional risk, eligi-
bility for a home-delivered meal program, and potential
controlling variables that are described in the following sec-
tions. Of the 484 elderly persons whose food insecurity data
were available, 406 had complete data and were included in
the final analysis.
Dependent Variable--Food Insecurity
In NHANES III, we used the family food insufficiency
question to determine food insecurity status. The question
on family food insufficiency, defined as "an inadequate
amount of food intake due to lack of resources," asked "Do
you have enough food to eat, sometimes not enough to eat,
or often not enough to eat?" (Briefel & Woteki, 1992). An
elderly person was classified as food insecure if he or she
reported positively to "sometimes or often did not get
enough food to eat," a convention that has been adopted in
other research on this topic. This question has undergone
cognitive testing and it has been shown to be valid, and it
has also been demonstrated to be associated with food ex-
penditures and reduced nutrient and food group intake,
mostly in younger adults (Alaimo et al., 1998; Alaimo, Ol-
son, & Frongillo, 1999; Basiotis, 1992; Briefel & Woteki,
1992; Cristofar & Basiotis, 1992; Frongillo, Rauschenbach,
Olson, Kendall, & Colmenares, 1997; Rose & Oliveira,
1997; Wolfe, Olson, Kendall, & Frongillo, 1998).
In NSENY, we used a three-item food insecurity mea-
surement to decide food insecurity status during the last 6
months. Questions were, "Do you have enough money to
buy the food you need most of the time?" "Have you
skipped one or more meals because you had no food in the
house or you thought that soon you might not have enough
food?" "Have you had to choose between buying food or
paying bills or buying something else you needed?" Content
validity of the items was established by previous research in
intensive pretests of the instruments in various rural and ur-
ban settings. These items were associated with low income,
food assistance program participation, race-ethnicity, and
eating alone (Burt, 1993; Quandt & Rao, 1999). An elderly
person was classified as food insecure if he or she reported
affirmative responses to at least one of the three items.
Independent Variables
Variables found to be associated with food insecurity in
previous research (e.g., functional impairments, adverse health
conditions, low income, minority status, low education, and
food assistance program participation) were considered as
potential independent variables contributing to food insecu-
rity (Alaimo, 1997; Campbell, 1991; Frongillo et al., 1992;
Hamilton et al., 1997; Nord et al., 1999; Quandt & Rao,
1999; Rose et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 1996). We also consid-
ered variables that might intervene in the relationships be-
tween functional impairments and food insecurity, such as
age and adverse health problems. Only variables that were
known to be reasonably associated with food insecurity and
functional impairments, available in the data set, and dem-
onstrated not to result in multicollinearity were chosen as
independent variables. Some variables were categorized for
simplicity of interpretation or because of restricted distribu-
tions; in each case, models with either a continuous or cate-
gorical version of a variable gave similar results.
Physical functioning.--Activities of daily living (ADL)
and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) have been
the most frequently assessed indicators of disability (Kovar
& Lawton, 1994). NHANES III included four items on ADL
(dressing, eating, getting in or out of bed, and transferring)
and two items on nutrition-related IADL (preparing own
meals and managing money). NSENY included five items
on ADL (getting in or out of chair/bed, feeding self, getting
dressed, taking bath/shower, and toileting) and five items on
IADL (getting around by car, using public transportation,
doing light housework, managing money, and taking medi-
cine). Physical functioning included three categories: no
problem (having no difficulty in ADL and IADL), IADL
problem (having at least one difficulty in the IADL), and
ADL problem (having at least one difficulty in the ADL).
S96 LEE AND FRONGILLO
Chronic disease.--Chronic disease variables were the
presence of serious health problems (in NSENY) or at least
one of eight self-reported clinically diagnosed diseases that
are highly prevalent and affect nutritional and health status
among elderly persons (in NHANES III; arthritis, hyperten-
sion, health failure, stroke, cataract, cancer, diabetes melli-
tus, and emphysema). Of those with at least one chronic dis-
ease in NHANES III, about three quarters had either one or
two diseases. Preliminary analysis showed that similar re-
sults were obtained when we used a chronic disease variable
as either categorical or continuous.
Sociodemographic and economic variables.--Age was
divided into three groups for comparison by decade:
younger old (60­69), older old (70­79), and oldest old (80
and older). Race-ethnicity was categorized into three groups
(non-Hispanic White and others, non-Hispanic Black, and
Hispanic). A three-category indicator of living arrangement
included living with spouse, living with others, and living
alone. Educational status was broken down into two groups
(high school graduate or less vs more than high school grad-
uate). A continuous social support variable included infor-
mation about how often respondents saw friends or relatives
per week in NHANES III. A dichotomous social isolation
variable included information about whether respondents had
any friends or relatives to see or talk with at least once each
week in NSENY. Location included two categories: metro
or nonmetro in NHANES III, New York City or non­New
York City in NSENY. Poverty index ratio (PIR), computed
as the midpoint of the observed family income category in
household interview divided by the poverty threshold, was
split into five groups (less than 50%, 50­100%, 100­130%,
130­200%, and more than 200%) in NHANES III and two
groups (less than or equal to 150% vs more than 150%) in
NSENY. Food assistance program participation indicated
whether respondents currently participated in programs
available in their community. Programs for which informa-
tion was available were the Food Stamp Program and ENP
in NHANES III and ENP in NSENY. In addition, we con-
structed dichotomous variables to indicate gender and di-
etary change due to health problems.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics of study population by age and the
prevalence of food insecurity by each of the independent
variables were analyzed. We used multiple logistic regres-
sion analysis to assess the relationships between food inse-
curity and other factors. We used a hierarchical logistic
regression analysis to test the relative contributions of five
separate groups of risk factors (physical functioning, health
problems, social supports, sociodemographic, and economic)
for food insecurity. Model fit was measured by area under
the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The
ROC area is analogous to R2 and ranges between 0.5 and 1.0
(Frongillo et al., 1992). We conducted the analysis by using
the SVY command in STATA (Statacorp, 1997), which
takes into account sample weights and the complex survey
effect adjusting for oversampling, noncoverage, and nonre-
sponse.
RESULTS
Weighted percentages and means for descriptive statistics
of the study population by three age groups from two data
sets are presented in Table 1. Of the study population in
NHANES III, the average age was 70.8 years (SE  0.2),
more than 15% were in their 80s, 57% were female, and

FOOD INSECURITY OF U.S. ELDERLY PERSONS S97
11% were minority. The study sample from NSENY was
similar: Mean age of the study sample was 67.7 years (SE 
0.73), 19.9% were in their 80s, 61.6% were female, and
20.9% were minority. Almost half of the NSENY respon-
dents were widowed (42.5%), living alone (47.0%), and
functionally impaired (21.9% for ADL and 30.37% for
IADL). One third of them had a low income, less than or
equal to 150% of PIR. Overall, younger old persons were
more likely to live with their spouse and to have higher edu-
cation, income, and physical functioning than older and old-
est old persons. Oldest old persons were more likely to be
White, female, living alone, and participating in food assis-
tance programs.
Table 1 also shows the prevalence of food insecurity
among elderly persons by sociodemographic, economic,
physical functioning, and health characteristics. Overall,
more than 1.7% of the older population in NHANES III
were food insecure. Food insecurity was not equally distrib-
uted across race-ethnicity: Hispanic elderly persons had the
highest prevalence of food insecurity and non-Hispanic
Black persons were next highest. Poverty was related to the
prevalence of food insecurity; persons with income less
than 50% of PIR had the highest prevalence of food insecu-
rity. Food insecurity existed, however, even among the
34.6% whose income was over poverty line. Food assis-
tance program participants showed a higher prevalence of
food insecurity. Functional impairment, particularly ADL
problems, increased prevalence of food insecurity, com-
pared with those without physical functioning problems.
Similar results were shown in NSENY. The prevalence of
food insecurity was higher among low-income, minority,
functionally impaired, and socially isolated elderly persons.
Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that younger
age, poverty, minority status, less education, and food assis-
tance program participation were significantly associated
with food insecurity in NHANES III (Table 2). Similarly,
poverty, minority status, living with others, and social isola-
tion were significantly associated with food insecurity in
NSENY. Even after we controlled for these significant fac-
tors, elderly persons with ADL functional impairments had
significantly increased odds of reporting food insecurity in
both NHANES III (OR  1.9, CI  1.34­2.80) and
NSENY (OR  2.8, CI  1.04­7.54). Thus, this relation
between food insecurity and functional impairments was in-
dependent of other sociodemographic and economic charac-
teristics.
A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed the in-
dependent effect of five groups of risk factors predicting
food insecurity (results not shown). The first model in-
cluded the physical functioning group only, and the ROC was
0.60 in NHANES III and 0.65 in NSENY. Then, each of the
remaining four groups of variables were added in the order
of health problems, social supports, sociodemographic, and
economic groups; the ROC areas were, respectively, 0.61,
0.66, 0.82, and 0.87 in NHANES III and 0.66, 0.71, 0.77,
and 0.77 in NSENY. Thus, functional impairments and
sociodemographic variables made particularly substantial
contributions to predicting food insecurity.
DISCUSSION
Elderly persons possess nutritional and health character-
istics distinct from people in other age groups, and the
phenomenon of food insecurity is also distinct in this popu-
lation. As with other age groups, sociodemographic and
economic factors, such as poverty, low education, race-eth-
nicity, and food program participation, limit the resources
available for household food acquisition. Consistent with
previous research, older minorities were more likely to be at
risk of food insecurity than their nonminority counterparts.
Special attention needs to be paid to older minorities, who
comprise a dramatically increasing proportion of elderly
persons.
Food insecurity results from more than the constraints of
financial resources in elderly persons, however. Functional
impairments had a significant relation with food insecurity,
even after we controlled for other significant factors. The
importance of functional impairments in predicting food in-
security suggests that the concept of altered food use should
be considered a part of food insecurity in elderly persons.
The significant risk factors for food insecurity tend to oc-
cur simultaneously, putting subgroups of elderly persons at
much higher risk of food insecurity. The prevalence of food
insecurity among elderly persons with functional impair-
ments in addition to being minority and poor increased from
8.6% to 13.4% in NHANES III and from 19.1% to 37.5% in
NSENY.

The negative effects of functional impairments on food
insecurity can be moderated by the quality and quantity of
social supports elderly persons have, although there has
been equivocal evidence on the buffering effect of social
support for those elderly persons who have functional im-
pairments (Newsom & Schulz, 1996; Unger, McAvay, Bruce,
Berkman, & Seeman, 1999). Functionally impaired elderly
persons who have adequate social supports to prepare and
cook may maintain adequate food use. Elderly persons who
live with a spouse or others may compensate for their al-
tered food use problems compared with those living alone.
It is important to take into account social supports in under-
standing the effects of functional impairments on altered
food use and food insecurity. Moderating effects of social
support on the negative effects of functional impairments on
food insecurity were not found in this study, however; there
were no significant interactions among these variables.
The potential underestimation of the prevalence of food
insecurity among elderly persons has been recognized be-
cause of the possibility that elderly persons have different
physical and socioeconomic conditions, perceptions, atti-
tudes, and experiences throughout their life toward food
problems (Wolfe et al., 1996). National surveys--including
the CPS that incorporated the first direct food insecurity and
hunger module--showed that households headed by an el-
derly person had lower rates of food insecurity than those of
younger adults (Alaimo et al., 1998; Hamilton et al., 1997;
Rose et al., 1998). Furthermore, the prevalence from na-
tional surveys is usually lower than that of local studies
done exclusive for elderly persons (Burt, 1993; Frongillo et
al., 1992; New York State Department of Health and Office
for the Aging, 1996; Wolfe et al., 1998). A likely explana-
tion for these findings is that the limited concepts and mea-
sures used in these studies do not reflect the special charac-
teristics of food insecurity in elderly persons.
These results suggest that altered ability to use food due
to functional impairments, regardless of the availability of food
and social supports in the household, has an independent
role in characterizing food insecurity among elderly per-
sons. That is, functional impairments are related to the spe-
cial nature of food insecurity among elderly persons. In
comparison with other age groups, food insecurity in elderly
persons includes not only limited food affordability, avail-
ability, and accessibility, but also altered food use. Food-
insecure elderly persons are those who have multiple prob-
lems that prevent them from achieving nutritional well-being.
They are more likely to participate in food assistance pro-
grams designed to ameliorate their problems than food-secure
elderly persons. Therefore, nutrition programs should recog-
nize and provide services to cover those needs.
