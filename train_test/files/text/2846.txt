Abstract
This paper proposes a new framework for studying the effects of monetary policy on busi-
ness investment. Important ambiguities with the modeling of investment dynamics and in-
teractions between real and financial decisions suggest modeling investment spending as a
VAR. Based on a panel of financial statement data for 6,408 German firms (44,345 data-
points) supplemented with user costs of capital and confidential measures of creditworthi-
ness, we generate GMM estimates of a Vectorautoregressive Investment Model (VIM). It
contains investment and cash flow as endogenous variables, and the user costs of capital
and sales growth as additional explanatory variables.
We report four substantive findings. First, monetary policy matters, and business invest-
ment is responsive to interest rates embedded in the user cost of capital. Second, allowing
real and financial decisions to interact raises the impact of monetary policy by one-third
relative to simulations of an investment equation in isolation that assumes an exogenous
financial policy. Third, the sensitivity of investment to cash flow shocks is raised by two-
thirds relative to single equation computations. Fourth, firms with poor credit ratings are
"paralysed" in being unable to react to changing economic conditions as given by relative
prices or demand. On the other hand and consistent with binding financing constraints,
these endangered firms show a high responsiveness to cash flow shocks.
Apart from these substantive conclusions, this paper demonstrate that the panel VAR ap-
proach is useful for modeling firm dynamics and real/financial interactions and for assess-
ing monetary policy transmission.

Zusammenfassung
In diesem Papier wird ein neuer Rahmen für die Untersuchung der Wirkungen von Geld-
politik auf privatwirtschaftliche Investitionen vorgeschlagen. Wegen ungelöster Probleme
bei der Modellierung der Investitionsdynamik und der Interaktion zwischen realwirtschaft-
licher und der finanzieller Sphäre einer Unternehmung bietet sich die Modellierung der In-
vestitionsentscheidung als VAR an. Auf der Grundlage eines Panels von Jahresabschlüssen
für 6,409 deutsche Firmen (44 345 Datenpunkte), erweitert um Kapitalnutzungskosten und
vertrauliche Daten über Kreditwürdigkeit, stellen wir GMM-Schätzungen eines vektorauto-
regressiven Investitionsmodells (VIM) vor. Es enthält die Investition und den Cash Flow
als endogene Variablen, und außerdem Kapitalnutzungskosten und Umsatzwachstum als
weitere erklärende Variablen
Vier inhaltliche Ergebnisse verdienen es, herausgehoben zu werden. Erstens, Geldpolitik
ist wirksam, und privatwirtschaftliche Investitionen reagieren auf Änderungen der in den
Kapitalnutzungskosten enthaltenen Zinsen. Zweitens, eine Berücksichtigung der Interak-
tionen von realwirtschaftlichen und finanziellen Entscheidungen erhöht die geschätzte
Wirkung von Geldpolitik um ein Drittel im Vergleich zur Simulation einer isolierten Inve-
stitionsgleichung, bei welcher die finanzielle Situation als exogen betrachtet wird. Drittens
erhöht sich die Sensitivität der Investition bezüglich Cash Flow-Schocks um rund zwei
Drittel, verglichen mit einer Einzelgleichungsschätzung. Viertens, Firmen mit geringer
Kreditwürdigkeit wirken "gelähmt" ­ sie sind nicht in der Lage, sich auf Änderungen der
wirtschaftlichen Bedingungen in Gestalt von Relativpreisen oder der Nachfrage einzu-
stellen. Andererseits weisen diese Firmen eine hohe Sensitivität bezüglich Cash Flow-
Schocks auf, was konsistent ist mit bindenden Finanzierungsrestriktionen.
Abgesehen von diesen inhaltlichen Ergebnissen zeigt das Papier, dass der Panel VAR-An-
satz für die Modellierung der unternehmerischen Dynamik, der Interaktion von realer und
finanzieller Sphäre sowie der monetären Transmission zweckmäßig ist.

A Vectorautoregressive Investment Model (VIM)
And Monetary Policy Transmission:
Panel Evidence From German Firms *
1 Introduction
How does monetary policy impact economic activity? One of the most important transmis-
sion channels operates on highly volatile business fixed investment. The monetary authori-
ties alter the terms and availability of credit, and impact investment in plant and equipment.
While this textbook version of one transmission channel is widely accepted, questions re-
main about its empirical importance.1
A key difficulty facing econometric assessments of this monetary policy channel is unrav-
elling the complex dynamics that characterize business investment. While theoretical
frameworks offer precise implications about long-run capital formation, these formal mod-
els have proven less useful in formulating dynamic relations describing transitional invest-
ment behaviour. The roles of convex adjustment costs, costly reversibilities, and fixed
costs, inter alia, have been studied extensively, and important new insights have been de-
veloped. However, little consensus exists on which factors are most relevant for modelling
investment spending. Hence, the movement of investment spending at cyclical frequencies
and its response to variations in interest rates are not fully understood.
Partly in response to these gaps, research on finance constraints has been actively pursued
over the past 15 years, and has increased understanding of short-run investment behaviour.
Asymmetric information and monitoring frictions between borrowers and lenders result in
incentive and agency problems that, in turn, create a wedge between the costs of internal
and external finance. Perhaps the most important empirical implication is that financial

variables - usually cash flow - properly belong in the investment equation. While the im-
portance of financial factors on business investment decisions has been documented in
many studies, whether the coefficients on these variables signify finance constraints is an
open question. For example, Chirinko (1997) and Gomes (2001) show that, in formal op-
timising models, the effects of finance constraints can be capitalized into fundamentals,
thus altering the interpretation and role of financial variables in investment equations. In
Abel and Eberly (2002), investment spending by an optimising firm faced with uncertainty
and imperfect competition depends on cash flow even though the firm does not face any fi-
nance constraints. While one can accept the economic importance of finance constraints
and the existence of a premium on external finance, doubts exist concerning precisely how
these financial factors enter formal theoretical models and affect the specification of an
econometric investment equation.
A further implication of finance constraints for firm behaviour is that real and financial de-
cisions are intertwined. An important property of the separation theorem of Modigliani and
Miller (1958) is that the supply of finance is infinitely elastic at the prevailing interest rate,
and thus real investment decisions can be considered in isolation from financial decisions.
Asymmetric information and monitoring cost frictions disrupt this separation theorem, and
require that real and financial decisions be analysed in tandem. Benito and Young (2002)
take an important first step in that direction, but they stop short of modelling the dynamic
consequences of simultaneity.
These real/financial interactions, coupled with important ambiguities concerning the mod-
elling of investment dynamics, suggest taking a new approach to understanding the invest-
ment process and its responses to monetary policy. We adopt a VAR methodology, and ap-
proximate the complicated and incompletely understood relations among investment and
its determinants as a VAR with minimal restrictions.
We begin our analysis in Section 1 by considering specification issues for our Vectorauto-
regressive Investment Model (VIM). The neoclassical investment model developed by Jor-
genson (1963) guides the specification of the basic determinants of investment spending. In
this framework, sales is the quantity variable, and the user cost of capital is the price vari-
able. (The user cost variable contains an interest rate, and is key to evaluating the effects of
monetary policy on investment spending.) We assume that firms operate in competitive
markets and minimize cost; thus, price and quantity variables are exogenous. Recent re-
search on finance constraints has demonstrated that cash flow is an important determinant
of investment spending, and we include cash flow as our financial variable. That research
has also shown that financial decisions affect and are affected by real investment decisions
and, hence, both investment and cash flow are endogenous. Furthermore, current cash flow
­ 3 ­
shocks affect current investment but, owing to gestation and time-to-build lags, investment
does not impact cash flow contemporaneously.
Econometric issues are considered in Section 2. We estimate VIM with an equation-by-
equation GMM procedure that is asymptotically efficient for our recursive system of dy-
namic simultaneous equations.2 Lag lengths are determined with two specification tests. As
with any VAR, the individual VIM coefficients are not meaningful in and of themselves.
We calculate dynamic multipliers, impulse responses, and error bands associated with the
exogenous and endogenous variables, respectively.
Estimates of our VIM are based on three unique datasets for German firms discussed in
Section 3. First, as part of its rediscount lending operation, the Bundesbank collected a vast
amount of detailed financial statement data. After accounting for lags, outliers, and missing
observations, we have an unbalanced panel of 44,345 datapoints for 6,408 firms for the pe-
riod 1988-1997. Second, we compute user costs of capital along the lines presented in King
and Fullerton (1984), adapting important prior work by Harhoff and Ramb (2001) and
Ramb (forthcoming) for the purposes of this study. Third, in discharging its credit evalua-
tion obligation, the Bundesbank routinely determined overall creditworthiness through a
detailed discriminant analysis.3 These confidential credit ratings are a precise indicator of
those firms facing a substantial external finance premium, and will be important in exam-
ining the differential responses by financial constrained and unconstrained firms. In combi-
nation, these three datasets provide an exceptional opportunity to analyse the response of
investment spending to changes in user costs and shocks to cash flow.
Sections 4 and 5 simulate VIM's estimated on different sub-samples. Section 4 provides
benchmark results with the full sample, and draws comparison between a single equation
investment model in which financial variables are exogenous and VIM in which both real
and financial variables are endogenous. Dynamic multipliers computed for changes in the
two exogenous variables - user cost and sales - and impulse response computed for shocks
to the two endogenous variables ­ investment and cash flow ­ are larger in VIM than in a
single equation model. Endogenizing financial decisions leads to more substantial reactions
by firms and a more potent monetary policy transmission channel. A 25 basis point in-
crease in short-term rates reduces investment by a substantial 3.1% in two years.
2 Our econometric model differs from that used in the pioneering study of Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen
(1988). They estimated a VAR model excluding any contemporaneous variables, whereas we have a
recursive system of dynamic simultaneous equations.
3 Since the implementation of the Monetary Union on January 1, 1999, the Bundesbank continues to
assess creditworthiness in the course of the Eurosystem monetary policy operations, but it no longer
rediscounts trade bills.
­ 4 ­
The roles of heterogeneity and finance constraints are explored in Section 5. Firms facing
relatively costly external finance are identified with our confidential Bundesbank credit-
worthiness data. The sensitivity of these firms to changes in the exogenous variables and
shocks to the endogenous variables are compared to firms that have a much lower external
finance premium. Firms with poor credit ratings do not react to changing economic condi-
tions as given by relative prices or demand. This "paralysis" might be traceable to their ina-
bility to finance investment. On the other hand and consistent with binding financing con-
straints, these endangered firms show a high responsiveness to cash flow shocks.
Section 6 contains a summary and conclusions.
1. Specifying VIM
1.1. Some Perspective On Modeling Investment Spending
The primary focus of this study is on investment spending, and we begin with a considera-
tion of investment modelling strategies appearing in the literature. In specifying an invest-
ment equation, it is important to distinguish between demand for the stock of capital and
demand for the flow of investment. Since the capital stock is a factor of production, the
standard tools of microeconomics can be used to relate the demand for capital, conditional
on output, to its "price." The definition of this price variable is complicated by capital's du-
rability. The important contributions of Jorgenson (1963) and Hall and Jorgenson (1967)
relate the price of durable capital to the user cost (or rental price) of capital, defined as a
function of interest, tax, and depreciation rates and relative prices. With a readily measur-
able user cost as a price variable, the long-run demand for capital can be easily analysed.
Complications arise, however, when specifying the demand for the flow of investment.
Two sets of "frictions" introduce important and complex factors into the investment equa-
tion. The first set of frictions includes dynamic elements such as convex adjustment costs
with changing the capital stock, delivery lags, vintage effects, costly reversibility con-
straints, time-to-build lags, fixed costs, and gestation lags. The interaction between these
frictions and durability forces the optimising firm to take a deep look into the future. Con-
sequently, expectations of future variables are an additional dynamic element affecting the
investment equation. The second set of frictions is due to asymmetric information and
costly monitoring between borrowers and lenders that, in turn, lead to constraints on the
availability and cost of external finance. Finance constraints further imply that real and fi-
nancial decisions are intertwined.
­ 5 ­
While explicit models have the notable advantages of being based on a choice-theoretic
framework and having coefficients in the econometric equation that can be identified with
technology and expectation parameters, several problems have arisen. First, their empirical
performance has been disappointing, and coefficient estimates appear fragile in many ap-
plications. Second, in most cases, they do not provide a framework for assessing the impact
of monetary policy on investment spending that is the central concern of the present study.
Third, there is a great deal of uncertainty about which of the frictions listed above are im-
portant for understanding the investment decision. While additional work with explicit
models is likely to yield valuable insights into the investment process, our analysis of
monetary policy transmission can best be undertaken with an implicit model given the cur-
rent state of development of explicit models.
1.2 The Investment Equation
Implicit models are based on a less formal specification of the capital accumulation proc-
ess. Theory is used to suggest the determinants of investment spending that, in turn, enter
into a relatively unrestricted econometric equation.
We assume that the firm operates in competitive markets, and takes output and prices as
given. (Since the median firm in our sample has 119 employees, this atomistic assumption
seems appropriate.) Cost minimizing behaviour, coupled with a CES production function
(Coen, 1969), results in the following specification of the logarithm of the optimal capital
stock (k*),
k*
t
= 0
+ 1
uc*
t
+ 2
s*
t
(1)
where uc*
t
is the logarithm of the long-run user cost of capital (described in detail in Sec-
tion 3.2 and Appendix A), s*
t
is the logarithm of long-run sales, and the 's are parameters
related to the production technology. In (1), the cost of finance is assumed independent of
the amount used by the firm; this assumption will be discussed below.
The challenge facing the applied econometrician is to translate the above demand for a
stock of capital into the demand for the flow of investment. To derive a useful econometric
specification, we introduce dynamics with three assumptions. First, the adjustment of the
capital stock to its optimal level is distributed over time according to the following lag
specification,
kt
= It
/Kt-1
­  = (L) k*t
, (2)
­ 6 ­
where  is the first-difference operator, the difference in the logarithm of the capital stock
equals the investment/capital ratio less depreciation (It
/Kt-1
- ), and (L) is a polynomial in
the lag operator representing technological constraints such as delivery lags and other fric-
tions.
Second, following Jorgenson (1966), we assume that (L) can be approximated by a ra-
tional lag polynomial, (L)/(1-(L)), and rewrite (2) as follows,
It
/Kt-1
­  = (L)/(1-(L)) k*t
, (3a)
It
/Kt-1
= (L) k*t
+ (L) It-1
/Kt-2
+  , (3b)
where  =  (1­(1)). The (L)'s, (L)'s, and  contain technology parameters.
Third, in preparing their decisions at time t, agents form expectations about the long-run
values determining the optimal capital stock in (1). These expectations are based upon cur-
rent and lagged values of variables determining the optimal capital stock and by lagged
values of the dependent variable. Combining the above assumptions, identifying firm-spe-
cific variables with an i index, and appending an error term (i,t
), we obtain the following
investment equation,
Ii,t
/Ki,t-1
= UC(L) uci,t
+ S(L) si,t
+ I/K(L) (Ii,t-1
/Ki,t-2
) + i
+ i,t
, (4)
where the (L)'s are coefficients representing a mixture of technology and expectation pa-
rameters. Thus, as with all implicit models, this specification is subject to the Lucas Cri-
tique. While this objection is undoubtedly correct theoretically, coefficient shifts are un-
likely to be important for the small changes in policy analysed in this study. Furthermore,
there is some empirical evidence indicating that the Lucas Critique is not quantitatively
important.4
Equation (5) is based on the assumption that the supply of finance is infinitely elastic at the
prevailing interest rate. However, recent research has challenged this view.5 Owing to fi-
4 See Chirinko (1988), Taylor (1989), Chirinko, Fazzari, and Meyer (1999), and Estrella and Fuhrer
(forthcoming).
5 The recent renaissance began with Fazzari, Hubbard, and Peterson (1988). See Chatelain (forthcoming),
Hubbard (1998), and Schiantarelli (1995) for surveys, Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999, especially
equations 3.8 and 3.9) for a formal theoretical model, and Kaplan and Zingales (1997, 2000), Fazzari,
Hubbard, and Petersen (2000) for a lively exchange concerning some unresolved issues in the finance
constraints literature.
­ 7 ­
nancial market frictions, the cost of external finance exceeds the cost of internal finance,
and investment spending is sensitive to the quantity of internal funds. In this case, the com-
position of finance affects real decisions. Moreover, these real decisions affect finance. For
example, the additional indebtedness for a new investment project may lower cash flow for
several years due to interest expenses on the project debt and a higher external finance
premium on future borrowings. With financial market frictions, real and financial decisions
are intertwined.
To reflect short-term credit constraints, we follow the literature, and include the ratio of
cash flow to the capital stock as an additional argument in (5). Finally, we assume that the
error term, i,t
, contains three components: a firm-specific fixed effect (
, which incorpo-
rates i
), a time-specific fixed effect (t
), and a white noise error (i,t
). With these addi-
tional elements, we obtain the following autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) investment
equation,
Ii,t
/Ki,t-1
= UC(L) uci,t
+ S(L) si,t
+ CF/K(L) (CFi,t
/Ki,t-1
) (5)
+ I/K(L) (Ii,t-1
/Ki,t-2
) + i
+ t
+ i,t
.
1.3 The VIM Equation System
Our model of a cost minimizing firm facing finance constraints has several implications for
the variables appearing on the right-side of (5) and the specification of the VIM. Since the
price and quantity variables are taken as given, uci,t
and si,t
are exogenous. By contrast,
financing responds to investment, and (CFi,t
/Ki,t-1
) is an endogenous variable. Rather than
modelling the relations among these variables explicitly, we allow them to interact in a
relatively unrestricted manner by estimating the following Vectorautoregressive Investment
Model (VIM),

, t
, and Ui,t

taining firm-specific fixed effects, time-specific fixed effects, and white noise error terms,
respectively. Equation system (6) is a recursive system of dynamic simultaneous equations,
and will be the basis for our coefficient estimates and the associated dynamic multipliers
and impulse responses with which we assess the sensitivity of investment to monetary pol-
icy and other stimuli.
2. Estimating VIM
2.1. Obtaining Coefficient Estimates
This sub-section discusses identification and estimation issues with equation system (6).
To identify the coefficients, we assume that the error covariance matrix, i,t, is diagonal
and that the VIM has a recursive structure such that the matrix A0
is upper triangular,

With (7), current cash flow affects current investment through the a coefficient but, owing
to gestation and time-to-build lags, investment does not impact cash flow contemporane-
ously.
The coefficients are estimated by GMM. Following Arellano and Bond (1991) and Holtz-
Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988), we first-difference (6) to eliminate the firm-specific ef-
fects and, for notational simplicity, exclude the time-specific fixed effects,
A0 Yi,t
= A(L) Yi,t-1
+ B(L) Xi,t
+ Ui,t
i=1,N, t=1,T. (8)
Due to the resulting serial correlation in the error term (Ui,t
), the system is estimated by
GMM using the following instruments (whose number increases with t),
Zi,t
= [X'i,t-2
, ... X'i,1

and the GMM moment matrix, E[Gi,t

ments in A0

Our VIM extends the panel data VAR model considered by Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and
Rosen (1988) to a dynamic system of simultaneous equations. In an ordinary VAR system,
the coefficients can be estimated efficiently with equation-by-equation least-squares. By
contrast, Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen showed that an efficient GMM estimator for a
panel data VAR system must be estimated as a system. However, for the recursive structure
employed here, an equation-by-equation GMM procedure is asymptotically as efficient as
the system estimator. The reason is that under the assumption that the errors are uncorre-
lated across equations, the weight matrix W is diagonal and, therefore, the equation-by-
equation GMM procedure is identical to the system GMM estimator. In finite samples the
estimated weighting matrix is not diagonal, in general, and a difference usually exists be-
tween the equation-by-equation and system GMM estimators that disappears as N tends to
infinity (cf. Hayashi, 2000, Section 4.4). In our dataset, N equals 6,408.
2.2 Selecting The Lag Length
We employ two specification tests to select the lag length. With the First-Difference esti-
mator, white noise errors imply that the residuals between periods t and t-2 will be uncor-
related. The Lagrangian Multiplier statistic (LM) proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991)
tests for second-order residual serial correlation. A second specification test examines the
validity of the overidentifying restrictions with the SH statistic proposed by Sargan (1958)
and Hansen (1982). If the model is correctly specified, the residuals between periods t and
t-2 will be uncorrelated, and the overidentifying restrictions will be sustained.
Since our primary focus is on investment spending, we focus on the properties of this
equation for lag lengths of 2, 3, and 4 periods. The LM statistics have p-values of 0.008,
­ 10 ­
0.165, and 0.885 for lags 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the model with only two lags is not
acceptable. For the same three models, the p-values for the SH statistic are 0.002, 0.075,
and 0.009, respectively. Thus, only the investment model with three lags passes both speci-
fication tests, and all of the estimates reported in the tables are based on systems of equa-
tions with three lags.6
2.3 Computing Dynamic Multipliers, Impulse Responses, And Error Bands
The coefficient estimates from VAR models are difficult to interpret, but they provide use-
ful information for computing dynamic multipliers for changesin the exogenous variables
or impulse responses for shocks to the endogenous variables.
To compute dynamic multipliers, the final form of the system has to be determined. De-
fining D(L)  A0
- A(L), we can rewrite (6b) as follows,
D(L) Yi,t
= B(L) Xi,t
+ i
+ Ui,t
. (12)
The final form is obtained by multiplying the system with the inverse of D(L),
Yi,t
= M(L) Xi,t
+ D(1)-1 i
+ D(L)-1 Ui,t
(13)
Dynamic multipliers are computed from the elements of the M(L) = D(L)-1B(L) matrix
polynomial.
The error bands for the estimated dynamic multipliers are computed from the GMM esti-
mates of  and its asymptotic covariance matrix. From the asymptotic theory of GMM es-
timators (e.g., Hansen, 1982), it is known that they have an asymptotic normal limiting
distribution. Therefore, the distribution of a function of the estimated coefficients can be
simulated by drawing from the normal limiting distribution of the coefficient estimates.7
Finally, the dynamic multipliers are simulated with the functional relationship between
M(L) and .
To compute the effects of a shock to the dependent variable, the impulse responses are de-
fined with respect to the shocks in Ui,t
, and are computed from the elements of the D(L)-1

respectively.

matrix in (13). The error bands for the impulse responses are computed in a similar manner
to those for the dynamic multipliers.
3. Datasets
3.1. Financial Statements (UBS)
The Bundesbank's financial statement database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik, UBS) con-
stitutes the largest source of accounting data for nonfinancial firms in Germany.8 These
data were collected by the Bundesbank in performing its rediscounting and lending opera-
tions. Bills of exchange issued by nonfinancial firms were frequently presented to the Bun-
desbank by credit institutions (cf. fn. 3). When a bill was presented for discounting, the
creditworthiness of the issuing firm and all other firms that have held this bill needed to be
determined. In the case of default, liability for payment of the bill fell on any firm that had
held the bill. By law, the Bundesbank could only accept bills backed by three parties
known to be creditworthy.
About 70,000 annual accounts were collected per year on a strictly confidential basis by the
Bundesbank's branch offices. These data were initially subjected to a computer check for
logical errors and missing data. Approximately 15,000 accounts had to be excluded be-
cause they were incomplete, represented consolidated accounts, or were for firms in sectors
(e.g., agriculture) for which no meaningful results could be generated owing to the small
amount of available data. Additional checks and corrections for errors were undertaken in
the Statistical Department at the Bundesbank's Central Office in Frankfurt before finalizing
the UBS database.
The dataset used in estimation is smaller for several reasons. We use data only for firms lo-
cated in the manufacturing sector of West Germany to avoid any issues of comparability
between the western and eastern sections of the country. Sole proprietorships and private
partnerships are excluded because their tax treatment depends on personal characteristics
that are very difficult to quantify. State dominated corporations are also excluded. The da-
taset is further reduced by first-differencing, missing values, data cleaning, variable con-
8 This discussion draws on the Deutsche Bundesbank (1998) and Stöß (2001), which contain more
detailed descriptions of the UBS data.
­ 12 ­
struction involving lags, and outlier control.9 The data extend from 1988 to 1997.10 We
thus have available for our preferred econometric specification containing three lags (dis-
cussed in Section IV) 44,345 datapoints for 6,408 firms. For 1996, these data represent
42% of the total turnover of the West German manufacturing sector and 61% of the total
turnover of incorporated firms in all German manufacturing.
3.2 User Cost (UC)
The user cost of capital (UC) is the variable through which monetary policy through inter-
est rates affects investment spending. In very simple terms, the user cost is comprised of
three components,
UC = R * P * T, (14)
where R, P, and T represent rental, price, and tax terms, respectively. The rental term con-
tains two components, the opportunity cost of funds measured by the real long-term interest
rate (r = i - , the nominal discount rate (i) less the expected rate of inflation () in the price
of investment goods) and the economic rate of depreciation (). The P term is the price of
investment goods relative to the price of output. Two key taxes entering T are the rate of
income taxation (reflecting both federal and Länder rates, as well as the "solidarity sur-
charge") and the present value of the stream of current and future tax depreciation deduc-
tions. The user cost variable used in this study is much more complicated than presented in
this sub-section, and important details are discussed in Appendix A.
Table 1 contains summary statistics for the variables that enter VIM defined by equation
system (6).
3.3. Creditworthiness Ratio (CWR)
A unique element in this study is the set of creditworthiness ratios (Gesamtkennzahl,
CWR's) generated by the Bundesbank when it performed its rediscounting and lending op-
9 We control for outliers by discarding the upper and lower 1% tails of st
, (CFi,t
/Ki,t-1
), and the
creditworthiness ratio (introduced in Section 3.3) and the upper 2% tail of (Ii,t
/Ki,t-1
). See Appendix B
for further details about the financial statement data.
10 The beginning year of 1988 is chosen because the definitions of many important financial statement
variables were changed in 1986 by the directive harmonizing financial statements in the European
Union. For many firms, the changes were not instituted in 1987, and the amount of data available in the
UBS is unacceptably low in that year.
­ 13 ­
erations. The CWR's are determined by a discriminant analysis.11 The two underlying
populations are solvent and insolvent firms, where insolvency is indicated by a legal appli-
cation for bankruptcy. The sample is constructed by first identifying the relatively scarce
insolvent firms, and then adding a solvent firm from the same sector. To enhance the sta-
tistical properties of the discriminant function, the sample contains an equal number of sol-
vent and insolvent firms. The following information is used to compute the discriminant
function: 1) equity/pension provision ratio (adjusted equity capital and pension provisions
as a percentage of total capital employed); 2) return on total capital employed (profit before
income taxes and before interest payments as a percentage of total capital employed); 3)
return on equity (profit before income taxes as a percentage of adjusted equity income); 4)
capital recovery rate (net receipts as a percentage of capital invested); 5) net interest pay-
ment ratio (net interest as a percentage of turnover); 6) accounting practice (which affects
available valuation methods). The weights assigned to these categories are confidential.
These ratios are examined by the Bundesbank's Department of Credit, Foreign Exchange,
and Financial Markets for outliers.
The discriminant analysis determines two critical values of the CWR that classifies firms
into one of three categories: high degree of creditworthiness (Good), low degree of credit-
worthiness (Endangered), or Indeterminate. The proportion of distressed firms in the data
used in the discriminant analysis appears representative, and compares favourably to the
percentage of failed firms in the overall economy (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998; Stöß,
2001).
4. Simulating VIM - Full Sample
This section reports simulations of VIM to changes in the exogenous user cost and sales
variables and shocks to the endogenous cash flow and investment variables. As discussed
in Section 2, all coefficients are estimated by GMM with the equations first-differenced to
eliminate firm fixed effects. Coefficient estimates and error bands are presented in Appen-
dices C and E, respectively.
4.1. User Cost Change
Monetary policy affects investment spending through the interest rate embedded in the user
cost of capital. This variable enters the investment equation, and represents the interest rate
11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (1999) for further details about the construction of the CWR's and the credit
evaluation process.
­ 14 ­
channel of monetary policy. In VIM, the user cost also enters the cash flow equation. In
turn, cash flow affects investment and vice versa. These real/financial interactions are at
the core of the credit channel of monetary policy, and are also captured by VIM.
Table 2a and Figure 1a display the dynamic multipliers for investment and cash flow fol-
lowing from a one unit change in the user cost growth rate.12 As shown in columns 1 and
4, the responses of both investment and cash flow is substantial in the first two years and,
based on the error bands, these multipliers are statistically different from zero. The time
profile of responses differ. For investment, 92% of the cumulative response takes place in
the first two years. By contrast, only 67% of the reduction in cash flow occurs during the
same period.
Relative to single equation evaluations of monetary policy, VIM matters. Columns 2 and 5
contain comparable dynamic multipliers for the ADL investment equation (5) and an
analogously specified cash flow equation. The percentage differences between these single
equation multipliers and VIM are presented in columns 3 and 6. The cumulative difference
for investment is 33.7%. Thus, endogenizing financial decisions and recognizing the feed-
backs between investment and cash flow has a substantial impact on the monetary policy
transmission channel. For business investment, these feedbacks are one-third as large as the
interest rate channel.
To understand the economic significance of monetary policy, we adjust the entries in Table
2a to correspond to the percentage change in investment with respect to a 25 basis point in-
crease in the short-term interest rate. Specifically, the entries in columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 are
multiplied by 0.07.13 During the first two years after this monetary intervention, invest-
12 In this experiment, the monetary authorities raise the real rate for an indefinite period. Although this is
not a realistic assumption, it allows us to avoid the complications associated with specifying an
adjustment path for capital goods prices that returns the real interest rate to its long-run level. Moreover,
this assumption has no practical significance for our analysis of investment because the bulk of the
response to various stimuli occurs in the first two years.
13 The adjustment proceeds in two steps. First, the entries is Table 2a represent I/K, and are transformed
into the percentage change in investment by the following relation: (I/I) = (I/K) / (I/K), where (I/K) is
the mean value of 0.1813 taken from Table 1, column 1. Second, the entries in Table 2a are for a 100%
increase in user cost, and need to be adjusted to the percentage change in the user cost, UC/UC,
corresponding to a 25 basis point change. Consider an expanded version of the user cost equation (14),
UC = ((1-) i[m]-+) * P * T, where  is the corporate tax rate (see equation (A-3) for further details),
i[m] is the nominal long-term interest rate that depends on the monetary policy variable (m),  is the
expected rate of inflation in the price of investment goods,  is the economic rate of depreciation, and P
and T represent price and tax terms, respectively. Differentiating with respect to m, we obtain UC/UC
= (i/m) m (1-) / ((1-) i[m]-+), where (i/m) reflects the impact of the short-term rate
controlled by the monetary authorities on the long-term rate entering the user cost and m is the basis
point change in the short-term rate. We assume that (i/m) = 1, the net-of-tax real long-term rate is
0.01,  = 0.44 and  is 0.10; these numbers are approximate. For m = 0.0025, UC/UC = 0.0127.
­ 15 ­
ment falls by a substantial 3.1%. However, it is important to realize that this assessment
depends critically on the expectation assumptions reflected in the term structure of interest
rates.
For the purpose of exposition, we assume that the long term rate changes by the same
amount as the short term rate. Depending on how expectations are formed, the sensitivity
of the long term rate might be smaller or perhaps even be larger. While our results indicate
a statistically significant monetary policy channel that is enhanced by endogenous financ-
ing, its economic significance is sensitive to auxiliary assumptions outside the scope of the
present study.
4.2. Sales Change
Simulations of a one unit increase in sales growth are presented in Table 2b and Figure 1b.
Similar to the results with the user cost, dynamic multipliers based on VIM are approxi-
mately 30% larger than those computed from the ADL investment equation in isolation.
The multipliers are statistically different from zero at the 5% level for all 10 simulation pe-
riods.
To understand the economic significance of these multipliers and the role of demand shifts,
assume that exogenous sales rises for all firms by 1.0%14 In this case, the entries in Table
2b are multiplied by 0.01, and investment rises by 1.9% during the first two years and 3.0%
in the long-run (10 years).15 The well-known investment accelerator is alive and well and,
in VIM, enhanced by interactions with financial decisions.
4.3. Cash Flow Shock
The remaining two sets of simulations assess shocks to the equations comprising the
econometric system (6). Table 3a and Figure 2a contain impulse responses for a unit shock
to cash flow. Relative to single equation calculations, the sensitivity of investment to a cash
flow shock is 66% larger when the investment and cash flow equations interact. This dif-
(Note that this formulation does not allow the present value of depreciation allowances ("A" in
Appendix A) to vary with the interest rate due to computational considerations and a desire to separate
fiscal and monetary policy issues.) The entries in Table 2a are thus multiplied by 0.07 = 0.0127 / 0.1813.
14 This perturbation equals a one standard deviation movement in (filtered) GDP for the period 1970-1998.
The standard deviation is computed using a band-pass filter, and equals 1.06 (Agresti and Mojon, 2001,
Table 1).
15 This change is computed as follows: (I/I) = (I/K) 0.01 / (I/K), where (I/K) is taken from Table 2b,
column 1 and (I/K) is the mean value of 0.1813 taken from Table 1, column 1. For the first two
simulation periods, (I/I) = (0.1935+0.1467) * 0.01 / 0.1813 = 1.88%.
­ 16 ­
ference is twice as large as the comparable figures for the user cost and sales multipliers
discussed above.
As is standard in VAR analyses, we evaluate the response of investment to a one standard
deviation shock, which equals the residual standard error in the cash flow equation. In this
case, the entries in Table 3a are multiplied by 0.04, and investment rises by 3.9% in the
long-run in response to this cash flow shock.
4.4. Investment Shock
Table 3b and Figure 2b report the impulse responses associated with a unit shock to in-
vestment. Apart from the initial shock, the long-run effect on investment and the cumula-
tive difference between the VIM and ADL multipliers are small.
5. Simulating VIM - Sample Sorted By Creditworthiness
Much recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the importance of firm heteroge-
neity and the differential impacts of monetary policy on firms facing varying degrees of dif-
ficulty obtaining external finance. While the finance constraints literature has been charac-
terized by sharp differences of opinion (see fn. 5), there is rather broad agreement that
variations in firm creditworthiness and the resulting wedge between internal and external
finance are the key elements in models of finance constraints.16
The Bundesbank data on firm creditworthiness allows us to examine the impact of this type
of heterogeneity. Firms are classified by a direct measure of the external finance premium,
CWR. There are three categories of creditworthiness - Endangered, Good, and Indetermi-
nate - depending on the state in the year before the investment/capital ratio first enters the
regression model as a dependent variable. Our large sample permits us to discard the mid-
dle group in order to sharpen the evaluation.
Dynamic multipliers and impulse responses for the Endangered and Good classes of firms
are presented in Figure 3 (coefficient estimates are in Appendix D). A change in monetary
policy (and the associated change in the user cost) has almost no impact on investment by
Endangered firms in the first year and a relatively small effect in the second year. The sen-
sitivity of investment to this monetary impulse is much larger for the Good firms. An even
16 For example, Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988, p. 183), Kaplan and Zingales (1997, pp. 172-173),
and Bernanke and Gertler (1990, pp. 88-89).
­ 17 ­
more extreme pattern emerges with respect to a change in sales. Firms with poor credit
ratings do not react to changing economic conditions. This "paralysis" might be traceable
to their inability to finance investment. On the other hand and consistent with binding fi-
nancing constraints, investment is much more responsive for Endangered firms than for
Good firms (bottom panel of Figure 3). The CWR split sample results offer striking con-
firmation of the importance of firm heterogeneity and finance constraints for understanding
the differential effects of monetary policy.
6. Summary And Conclusions
This paper presents a new approach to modelling business investment spending and mone-
tary policy transmission. Ambiguities concerning the modelling of investment dynamics
and interactions between real and financial decisions suggest a VAR methodology for
drawing relations among investment and its determinants. We specify a Vector Autoregres-
sive Investment model (VIM) containing investment, user cost, sales, and cash flow vari-
ables. Estimates are based on a large panel dataset containing 44,345 datapoints for 6,408
German firms supplemented with data for the user cost of capital and firm credit ratings.
We obtain three key results. First, monetary policy matters. The effects of a monetary con-
traction are statistically significant and very rapid, with 92% of the cumulative response
occurring in the first two years. Over this period, a 25 basis point increase in the short-term
interest rate lowers investment by 3.1%, though this computation of economic significance
is sensitive to auxiliary assumptions outside the scope of this study.
Second, VIM matters. Relative to simulations of a single equation based on exogenous fi-
nancing, the sensitivity of investment to monetary policy is larger by one-third and to cash
flow shocks by two-thirds in VIM. Endogenizing financial decisions and recognizing feed-
backs between investment and cash flow has a substantial impact on the monetary policy
transmission channel.
Third, financial status matters. Firms with a poor credit rating are "paralysed" in being un-
able to respond to changes in the user cost and sales. However, they are more responsive to
cash flow shocks than firms with a good credit rating.
These initial results indicate that VIM is a feasible approach for analysing firm-level panel
data, and can shed new insights into firm behaviour and monetary policy transmission.

porate tax rate (the rate of tax paid if no profits are distributed). The user cost formula usu-
ally reflects investment tax credits determined as a percentage of the price of a purchased as-
set. During our sample period, no such credits were granted to German firms.
Our construction of user costs takes into account multiple assets, multiple sources of funds,
and individual taxation following the approach developed by King and Fullerton (1984),
extended by the OECD (1991) and Chenells and Griffith (1997), and applied to the German
data by Harhoff and Ramb (2001) and Ramb (forthcoming).

costs used in this study.

marginal personal tax rate on capital income, and z is the effective tax rate on accrued
capital gains.
Between 1977 and 2000, the system of capital income taxation operating in Germany was a
split rate system with full imputation. Shareholders who were residents of the Federal Re-
public received a tax credit in the amount of the corporation tax on distributed profits paid.
Ultimately, the tax on capital income on distributed profits was equal to the marginal tax
on capital income. For Germany, therefore, the variable  assumes the value 1/(1-). Fur-
thermore, the effective tax rate on accrued capital gains was zero, as capital gains were not
taxed after a holding period of one year or more. In this case, the expression for the dis-
count rate reduces to

In the system with full imputation that prevailed in Germany from 1977 to 2000, the two
types of outside finance are equivalent (Sinn, 1984 and 1987).
To implement this framework and quantify (A-1), we use sector-specific output price levels
(pj,t
) and depreciation rate (e
j,t
), where j indexes sectors. Depreciation rates are calculated
from a perpetual inventory equation for sectoral capital stocks and investment flows; rates
for 1995-1997 are imputed. The price of capital goods (pI
t
) is an economy-wide deflator
dated at the beginning of the year, and the expected inflation rate (I
t
) measures the rate of
growth of pI
t
between the beginning and the end of year t. Aa,t
is the present value of depre-
ciation allowances as a firm-specific asset-weighted average for three different types of as-
sets (indexed by a): building, machinery and equipment. In each case, finance-specific dis-
count rates are used. (Aa,t
is computed with an optimal switch from accelerated to straight-
line depreciation methods.) The rate of interest rate (it
) is the average yield to maturity of
domestic listed debt securities. The tax rate on retained earnings is calculated as a com-
pound tax combining three different taxes of profits: the basic corporate tax on retained
earnings (r
t
), the local tax (Gewerbesteuer, gt
, is deductible for corporate tax purposes),
and the "solidarity surcharge" (st
, which is levied on all corporate and personal tax pay-
ments),

As in King and Fullerton, we treat local taxes as a normal tax on profits, ignoring some of
its special features.18 As a marginal tax rate for the shareholder, we used the highest mar-
ginal income tax max

To combine the different user costs resulting from the three different sources of finance, we
use a flow weights defined for the three sources of finance as follows: debt (with total li-
abilities including the share of borrowed funds in the reserve subject to future taxation),
new shares (the first difference of the stock of subscribed capital augmented by share pre-
mium or paid-in surplus), and retained earnings (retained earnings with the earned surplus
including the share of own funds in the reserves subject to future taxation). For increases of
debt, new shares, or retained earnings, the corresponding weight is calculated as a ratio to
the sum of positive sources of new finance in that year. If a particular weight assumes a
negative value, it is set to zero for that year; in each year, the weights sum to unity. For the
first year, the respective stock weights are used.
Appendix B: Variable Definitions And Outlier Control
Model Variables
Investment (I): Additions to plant, property and equipment come from the detailed schedule
of fixed asset movements (Anlagenspiegel). The schedule also includes their value at his-
torical costs. Not all firms show their investment data in the Anlagenspiegel, and, further-
more, missing investment data and zero investment are coded by the same symbol in the
raw data. An extremely cautious procedure was chosen to impute a zero value only in cases
where this is logically inevitable, in all other cases the variable is coded as missing.
Capital Stock (K) is computed by adjusting the value of fixed assets at historical costs
taken from the Anlagenspiegel for inflation and depreciation during the previous years, and
by applying a perpetual inventory procedure with a sector specific depreciation rate for all
years following the first year for which historic cost data and investment data are available:
18 Interest payments are only partly deductible, and the Gewerbesteuer payments are not credited to the
shareholders on distribution. The latter, strictly speaking, destroys the basic equivalence between sources
of outside finance. The Gewerbesteuer is raised at the local level. Due to data limitations, however, we
have to confine ourselves to the mean Gewerbesteuer rate for the whole sample.

Real Sales (S): Sales, deflated by a sector-specific index for output prices.
User Costs of Capital (UC): see Section 3.2 and Appendix A.
Cash Flow (CF): Net income plus depreciation, deflated by a sector-specific index for out-
put prices.
Creditworthiness Ratio (CWR): A discriminant analysis procedure separates firms with
high a priori risk of default from those with a low risk, also see Section 3.3. Firms are
placed in one of three categories of creditworthiness: "good credit standing", "indifferent
credit standing" and "endangered credit standing". Individual ratios for calculating dis-
criminant functions in the manufacturing sector include:
· equity/pension-provision ratio (adjusted equity capital and pension provisions as a per-
centage of adjusted balance-sheet total);
· return on total capital employed (Profit/loss before taxes on income and before interest
payments as a percentage of adjusted balance-sheet total;
· return on equity (Profit/loss before taxes on income as percentage of adjusted equity);
· capital recovery rate (Net receipts/net expenditures as percentage of capital invested);
· net interest payment ratio (Net interest result as percentage of turnover/total output);
· accounting practice.
Here, balance sheet total and equity are adjusted by subtracting items like subscribed capi-
tal unpaid, goodwill, credits to proprietors and partners, formation expenses. "Net receipts"
is an elaborate measure for cash flow, not equal to the simpler one used in estimation. It is
profit plus depreciation, augmented by changes of items like provisions for taxes, other
short term provisions, pension provisions and other long term provisions, payments re-
­ 26 ­
ceived on account of orders, less items like increases of stocks of finished goods. Capital
invested is adjusted balance sheet total less liquid financial assets.
The creditworthiness ratio (CWR) takes on values between -99.9 and 99.9. It is a weighted
sum of the individual ratios. The weights are determined by the discriminant analysis pro-
cedure, as well as the cut-off points (cl
, cu
) for a grouping of creditworthiness:
-99.0 < CWR < cl
endangered credit standing
cl <
CWR < cu
indifferent credit standing
cu <
CWR < 99.9 good credit standing
Outlier control
Observations with missing values for sales, capital, investment, cash flow or the overall
rating ratio were excluded. The presence of CWR serves as a check that the EU harmoni-
zation guidelines were being followed. The data set is trimmed by discarding the upper and
lower 1% tails of st
, (CFi,t
/Ki,t-1
), and CWR and the upper 2% tail of (Ii,t
/Ki,t-1

Notes To Table 2a:
Dynamic multipliers computed for a 1 unit change in the user cost; see Section 2.3 for de-
tails. * indicates statistical significance at 5% level. When the entries in columns 1, 2, 4,
and 5 are multiplied by 0.01, the multipliers correspond to a 25 basis point increase in the
short-term rate controlled by the monetary authorities and a 1.0% increase in the user cost
of capital; see Section 4 for details. Columns 1-3 (4-6) are for the investment (cash flow)
equation in equation system (6). Columns 1 and 4 simulate the complete equation system
(6), while columns 2 and 5 simulate their respective equations in isolation. The percentage
differences (% Diff.) in columns 3 (6) are computed as the difference between VIM and
ADL results divided by the sum of the ADL multipliers in column 2 (5).
