Background
This study explores potential data mining applications in
the Casemix context, which is expected to yield effective
and efficient health care services. The objective of work
focuses on determining hidden relevant patterns which
can't be processed by human capabilities all alone.
California Drug and Alcohol treatment Assessment
(CALDATA) of administrative type database can be
relevant study for the medical diagnosis in usage of
alcohol and drugs for patients admitted and discharged
during the stay in hospital to discover knowledge for
recovery process.
Methods
We utilized the observational study on cases registered to
California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs
(ADP) to promote the initiative for increasing availability
of abusive drug usage data for better drug recovery ser-
vices among the California. The cases were diagnosed
with Minitab diagnostic tool to access the Casemix data-
bases for retrieval of hidden information using data
mining tools. The K means clustering having used with
dendrogram to determine the possibility of existence of
patient admitted and discharged on the accountability for
usage of abusive substance between the years 1991-1993.
The classification of data is done among the educated
and uneducated class for categorized race with correla-
tion age at the time of admission to hospital. The analysis
has been performed on the patients admitted due to abu-
sive substance usage and treatment provided during the
stay in hospital and discharge status for final medical
diagnosis provided to patient those have suffered for long
stay during hospitalization.
Results
There has been a tremendous increase in the incidence
rate of admission cases in age group 45-49 years. The
probability of over 40% cases acquiring maximum num-
ber of abusive substance exists in patients who have
obtained post graduate education. The decline approxi-
mately 2.3% of criminal activities after proper diagnosis
to patients with high level of alcohol dependency among
the cases observed.
The total number of cases evaluated to study was
1,826 in 1991-1993; total number of features selected
was 1,205 for each case diagnosed. The cases were diag-
nosed on the basis of admission and discharge among
the prevalence of abusive substance usage. The subject
was classified for different subjects such as education,
age, duration of stay in the hospital, estimated reduction
on criminal cases, decrement of hospital cases while the
treatment provided during the stay.
We calculated the overall usage of abusive substance
among the categorized race at time of admission with
reference to the age. The results shows white were
among the categorized age group of 17 and under has
the maximum usage of abusive substance whereas native
Americans are the one those who have minimum con-
sumption of abusive substance usage. In diagnosis of
longest time of stay during the treatment in hospital
from day of admission to day of discharge due to abusive
substance usage we have calculated the overall maximum
number of prevalent cases during the year 1991- 1993,
we have found that longest stay was observed for male/
female aged below 17 years year and were correlated to
marital status that is unmarried. The clusters in the den-
drogram has been observed, where the largest cluster
represents the maximum number of unmarried male/
female patients diagnosed for highest abusive substance
usage, whereas the second cluster represents the second
highest cases for divorced/ separated has the maximum

usage of abusive substance, third cluster represent the
single between the age group 21-24 years accounted for
48% cases for length of stay during hospitalization, fourth
cluster represents the married cases those who were
among age group 35-39 years, the minimum number of
cases were studied for widowed.
Conclusions
The integrated approach, K-means and Hierarchical
Clustering technique using Minitab are well suited tech-
niques to provide insight of health service databases. The
probability of patients acquiring the abusive substance
depends on several factors such as education, age, marital
status and several other factors related to patients. The
discharge status of these highly correlates to criminal
activity and discharge status of hospitalization cases
which have reduced down tremendously after providing
treatment to admitted patients.
