Introduction
Third party logistics (3PL) outsourcing has become an integral
part of organizational supply chain processes. It involves pass-
ing on logistics-related activities in part or whole to an exter-
nal party to execute. Organizations are increasingly practicing
it with notable benefits: reduction in operations cost, improve-
ment in flexibility and operationalization of logistics services,
reduction in capital investment, and so on (Rahman, 2011;
Zacharia, Sanders, & Nix, 2011). Giri and Sarker (2017) sug-
gest that companies have recourse to 3PL to reduce the load of
logistics processes and achieve customer satisfaction and
competitive advantage (Chen, Goan, & Huang, 2011).
There is increasing global acceptance of the use of 3PL
(Sohal, Millen, & Moss, 2002; Zhu, Ng, Wang, & Zhao,
2017), indicating more growth opportunities for 3PL usage
by international organizations. Logistics services constitute a
critical aspect of the operations and supply processes in the
oil & gas business (O&G). O&G operations involve cross-
border transactions; exploration and drilling equipment are
frequently moved around locations; O&G personnel travel
round local and international asset locations and research and
development centers; and oil products are also transported
internationally, involving long-term global supply agree-
ments (Guajardo, Kylinger, & Ronnqvist, 2013; Shyshou,
Gribkovskaia, Laporte, & Fagerholt, 2012).
The O&G faces challenges in providing fit-for-purpose
in-house logistics solutions: unfavorable local conditions
for the IOCs (International Oil Companies), in-house capac-
ity to deliver specialized logistics solutions, and resource
inefficiencies arising from in-house resources that could
better be harnessed for O&G's core activities. Logistics is
not regarded as a core activity within the O&G as it is not
one of its exploration, production, and refining operations
which focus more on mechanical matrices. O&G requires an
external agent to provide the human element which is an
important factor in logistics service delivery, unbundle
logistics burden from the O&G routines, leverage assets for
economies of scale and scope, and provide professional
logistics services to the oil industry. In this context, Zhu
et al. (2017) acknowledge that logistics outsourcing are
being increasingly adopted by firms to "reduce costs and
increase flexibility" (p. 29).

Third Party Logistics Outsourcing:
An Exploratory Study of the Oil and Gas
Industry in Nigeria
Emah Patrick Etokudoh1, Mehraz Boolaky2,
and Mridula Gungaphul3
Abstract
Not much has been researched in logistics outsourcing in the emerging countries, particularly in the oil and gas industry.
This article investigates the feasibility of logistics outsourcing by the international oil and gas companies in the emerging
business environment of Nigeria. An exploratory, multicase, qualitative approach was applied, involving 40 interviewees in
three international oil companies and three of their logistics service providers. Findings reveal that vendors' capabilities,
host community issues, joint venture influence, and employees' reactions challenge international oil companies' logistics
outsourcing implementation while relationship management, contract management, and change management skills enable
them handle these challenges. The results also show that surveyed organizations implement logistics outsourcing piecemeal
and need to scale up their current capabilities to effectively integrate logistics outsourcing. The research confirms logistics
outsourcing is achievable in Nigeria, but requires synergies and symbiosis between the oil companies and their local vendors.

Country-Specific Logistics Challenges for IOCs
Certain region-specific needs exist that create local challenges
for 3PL delivery. The United States and Europe focus more on
integrated 3PL services and cost reduction, and Mexico on cus-
tomer services and core competencies (Arroyo, Gaytan, & De
Boer, 2006). Oil producing countries rank low in logistics per-
formance with their peculiar challenges (Hilmola, 2011).
Nigeria, an oil producing country, with over 5% logistics infra-
structural failure per annum has National Transport Policy that
suffers ineffective implementation with corresponding impact
in cost of logistics operations (Ugboaja, 2010). It seems then
that it would make economic sense for the IOCs to shift toward
3PL outsourcing in Nigeria. This, however, assumes that ven-
dor capability is guaranteed, and that employees' reaction to
3PL would not lead to logistics outsourcing failure.
Gaps in the Literature
Gaps exist in literature on the benefits and challenges of 3PL
services in Nigeria in general and particularly in the oil indus-
try. Much has been reported about 3PL in the developed econ-
omies (Arroyo et al., 2006; Lie, Chu, Wang, & Fan, 2013;
Sohal et al., 2002), but mostly on services and manufacturing
industries. Interestingly, there are cases of sector-driven logis-
tics solutions and country-specific needs (Carneiro, Ribas, &
Hamcher, 2010; Holguin-Veras, Jaller, Van Wassenhove,
Perez, & Wachtendorf, 2012).Also, there are concerns among
stakeholders over employees and their role in the success of
such initiatives like 3PL outsourcing (Boohene & Williams,
2012). There is nothing on the O&G in Nigeria, though there
are opportunities for local competencies development
(Hilmola,2011;Oko&Obasi,2014;PricewaterhouseCoopers,
2010; Rahman, 2011; Wright, Forster, & Beale, 2017).
The main objective of this research is to highlight how the
benefits of 3PL can support the international supply chain
processes in the OICs operating in an emerging economy of
Nigeria. It intends to establish the challenges associated with
3PL outsourcing by the international oil companies (IOCs),
considering the specific logistics constraints and the unique
work situations in Nigeria. It aims to contribute to the gen-
eral knowledge on international management, specifically
3PL, and present one of the first studies on 3PL in Nigeria in
general and in the oil industry in particular.
Research Questions
The following research questions were considered to guide
this study:
Research Question 1: What challenges do the IOCs face
in managing 3PL in Nigeria?
Research Question 2: Are in-house capabilities available
in IOCs for managing the 3PL in Nigeria?
Research Question 3: How would the employees respond
to 3PL outsourcing in Nigeria?
Research Objectives
The proliferation of 3PL vendors in Nigeria lead to a vendor
"hub" formation to ensure skill development for project
logistics management for a complex and highly regulated oil
industry (Chima, 2007; Sheffi, 2010). The first objective of
this study is to ascertain if the IOCs can have any challenges
associated with having the right set of 3PL vendors who can
provide them the unique industry logistics solutions in
Nigeria. The second objective is to establish if the IOCs have
the ability to manage interfaces with the external 3PL provid-
ers as supplier management is critical to its success (Lai,
Chu, Wang, & Fan, 2013). Self, Armenakis, and Schraeder
(2007) argue that during change, organizational content,
organizational processes, and organizational context can
encourage employee resistance. Therefore, the third objec-
tive is to determine how employees would respond to 3PL
outsourcing and identify how IOCs manage this.
Organization of This Article
The article consists of five sections as follows. Next to this
introduction is a detailed literature review of 3PL and logis-
tics in the oil business. Then methodology and methods
deployed in the research are discussed in the next session. In
the subsequent section, the results of the research are pre-
sented, along with the discussions on the findings. Finally,
conclusions are drawn based on the outcome of the result,
and the implications of the results are discussed.
Literature Review
Extant literatures on outsourcing of logistics function indi-
cate that there is increased interest in the management of
3PLs. Several studies conducted in the past show trends in
three major classes, namely, 3PL practices showing regional
differences, those with emerging global strategies, and those
on logistics outsourcing practices (Arroyo et al., 2006;
Rahman, 2011). In this section, existing literature is reviewed
in three main areas: global outsourcing and 3PL, managing
3PL and associated relationships, and the change manage-
ment perspective of 3PL adoption by organizations.
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework of this study anchors on two prin-
cipal theories--the Resource-Based (RBT) and Network
Theories (NT). With the RBT, the IOCs can own and mobi-
lize resources that are relevant for logistics services.
Companies access 3PL provider resources to save cost for
their logistics needs and also improve their logistics services.
They draw from the NT to gain from the dependencies avail-
able through their relationship with the 3PL providers.
However, switching to 3PL outsourcing implies change man-
agement. In sum, for IOCs to engage in 3PL outsourcing,
they need specific capabilities for relationship management
Etokudoh et al. 3
and change processes involving the management of employee
reactions to switch from in-house activities to outsourcing.
Thus, this study aims to examine the extent to which 3PL
vendors in Nigeria are ready to provide logistics support to
companies operating in the Oil and Gas industry.
RBT and NT: A brief review. RBT emphasizes that organiza-
tions combine resources through complex and unique pat-
terns that give competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).
Organizations can gain complementary resources through
3PLwhich can translate into competitive advantage. Through
RBT framework, firms can combine own resources with new
and third party resources to cope with the ever changing mar-
ket dynamics (Lin & Wu, 2014). The 3PL outsourcing results
in synergies that increase logistics asset of the providers.
Zacharia et al. (2011), however, see this from the Transaction
Cost Economics perspective, in which 3PL outsourcing
results in synergies that increase providers' logistics assets.
This results in increased combined activities for 3PL users;
thus, economies of scope and scale and eventually reduced
transaction costs are achieved. Underdeveloped resources
could, however, be a deterrent to effective leverage of such
external resources. As Jennings (1996) argues, cost of start-
ing and running outsourcing services could be a setback for
3PL. Thus, it is possible for transaction cost to increase
where much coordination of external parties is required.
NT emphasizes collaborations from relationship manage-
ment resulting in economic gain. Leuschner, Carter, Goldsby,
and Rogers (2014) find that relationship enables 3PLs and
their customers to work closely together to improve logistics
customer service and enhance overall firm performance. It is
relevant in buyer­seller relationships and 3PL networks
where complex systems give rise to network complexities
(Hearnshaw & Wilson, 2011; Yan, Francesco, Zhang, &
Yang, 2013). Such relationships, however, would require
effective change management processes in introducing 3PL
into the Nigerian O&G because of the likely multifaceted
challenges that could arise (Abdulraheem, Mordi, Ojo, &
Ajonbadi, 2013; Boohene & Williams, 2012; Lozano, 2013;
Parker, Charlton, Ribeiro, & Pathak, 2013).
Outsourcing and Globalization
Through outsourcing, organizations engage external suppli-
ers or service providers to accomplish not only noncore
activities but also some core activities (Michela & Carlotta,
2011). Outsourcing involves such steps as third party sup-
plier selection and managing relationships (Girma & Gorg,
2004; Jennings, 1996). Benefits of outsourcing include
resource optimization, competitive advantage, investment
and growth opportunities, and risk management (Lai et al.,
2013; Michela & Carlotta, 2011; Mitra, 2006; Paulraj &
Chen, 2007; Ulrich & Barney, 1984).
There are, however, some downsides of outsourcing
(Bettis, Bradley, & Hamel, 1992; Jennings, 1996; Michela
& Carlotta, 2011; Tayauova, 2012; Xi, Xu, & Todo, 2013).
Outsourcing can result in loss of technological capabilities
and industrial decline in manufacturing firms. Outsourcing
organizations risk loss of key competencies, control of sup-
pliers, and management skills for coordinating multiple
functions. Costs of developing data for process and rela-
tionships management, internal misgivings and fears over
reliability, and increased management requirements could
hinder organizations embracing outsourcing. However, as
with any change processes, it is assumed that an effective
change management process can help overcome these
limitations.
Outsourcing is expanding fast, as a globalization process
courtesy of trade liberalization increased competitive pres-
sures and developments in information technology (Capasso,
Cusmano, & Morrison, 2013; Lewin, Massini, & Peeters,
2009; Michela & Carlotta, 2011). Globalization has three
schools of thought (Peng, 2011). First are those who attribute
the 21st-century technological advancements to the birth of
globalization, associating it with imposition of multination-
als on the world. The second see globalization as part of
"human history" that evolves with time.
The third school, the pendulum view, reason that global-
ization has always existed, but with periodic progressions
and retardations. It connects with pre­World War I business
cycle risks on stocks in European markets (Nitschka, 2013;
Peng, 2011). Camilla, Serlenga, and Shin (2013), however,
argue that the periodic swings in globalization have negative
impact like the 2008 global decline that was occasioned by
the United States's financial crisis. They, however, uphold
that globalization has been instrumental to the increased
"technical efficiency" among the European countries.
The benefits from globalization have direct bearing in off-
shore outsourcing (Agrawal, Goswami & Chatterjee, 2010),
such as high value-adding activities outsourcing for innova-
tiveness, savings on labor cost, adoption of industry best
practices, and managing competitive pressures (Bertrand &
Mol, 2013; Martens, Dreher, & Gaston, 2010). Factor pricing
differentials result in cheaper costs of production for some
activities in specific countries, giving them comparative
advantage for outsourcing (Capasso et al., 2013). Some
regions host specific knowledge in some fields, specializing
in them with high innovation capabilities and thus attracting
outsourcing of related activities while articulating channels
for transformation of such knowledge to end users ((Almeida
& Kogut, 1999; Gedik, 2012; Kotlarsky, Scarbrough, &
Oshri, 2014). Multinationals with huge resource base and
high absorptive capacity for knowledge management deploy
offshore outsourcing as part of its global strategy thus lower-
ing "transaction and coordinating cost" (Bertrand, 2011).
There are concerns, however, on offshore outsourcing.
Organizations require ample knowledge, capability, and ade-
quate resources to effectively coordinate and make decisions
on offshore outsourcing (Bertrand, 2011; Bertrand & Mol,
2013; Tjader, May, Shang, & Vargas, 2014).
4 SAGE Open
3PL as offshore outsourcing initiative. The predominant logic is
that to be competitive, businesses should achieve high effi-
ciencies in their operations and processes by focusing on
core competencies while outsourcing noncore areas like
logistics activities (Ho, He, Lee, & Emrouznejad, 2012;
Lambert, Knemeyer, & Gardner, 2004). Limitations of
appropriability hazards may, however, negatively influence
the effectiveness of such values to business firms where cli-
ents' core knowledge is needed in the outsourcing activities
(Boguslauskas & Kvedaraviciene, 2009; Martinez-Noya,
Gracia-Canal, & Guillen, 2013).
Logistics involves movements of people and materials. The
benefits of logistics outsourcing have been reported severally
to include cost savings, concentrating of core competencies,
professionalism, customer satisfaction, speed of service deliv-
ery, resource optimization, and gaining competitive advantage
(Arroyo et al., 2006; Lieb, Millen, & Van Wassenhove, 1993;
Rabinovich, Windle, Dresner, & Corsi, 1999; Sohal et al.,
2002; Tian, Lai, & Daniel, 2008). In stable environments, it
can result in improvement of organizational performance with
cost leadership and innovative differentiation strategies
(Bhatnagar, Sohal, & Millen, 1999; Gilley & Rasheed, 2000).
Outsourcing for small- and medium-scale enterprises,
however, appears not to achieve improved logistics perfor-
mance (Solakivi, Toyli, Engblom, & Ojala, 2011). Savings
from logistics outsourcing not reinvested in other activities
lead to negative impacts (Dabhilkar & Bengtsson, 2008).
Also, logistics outsourcing may result in loss of employee
morale, loss of skills, overdependence on suppliers, and poor
contract design and implementation (Kremic, Tukel, & Rom,
2006; Mitra, 2006).
Several scholars have conducted country-specific
researches on 3PL outsourcing. Rahman (2011) reports the
use of 3PL in 40% of Australia's logistics needs, with a
potential increase in the future. Sohal et al. (2002) project
increased internationalization of 3PL in Australia. Lieb et al.
(1993) report longer 3PL usage among European manufac-
turers than in United States. Usage of 3PL in Europe and the
United States is higher than in Mexico, with the former
focusing more on cost servings and service integration while
Mexico focuses more on customer services and core compe-
tencies (Arroyo et al., 2006). China prefers 3PL providers
investing in relationship building, reputation, and informa-
tion network (Tian et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2013). Chiung-Lin
and Pei-Yu (2016) propose that the right integration between
3PLs and their customers leads to better flexibility and
enhanced customer satisfaction and productivity.
Managing 3PL and Associated Relationships
Buyer­seller relationships can mar or make the value chain
activities' effectiveness and efficiency (Ackerman, 1996;
Paulraj & Chen, 2007). Beneficial client­logistics provider
relationship should be strategic, improving with time, and
with good management interfaces, that deepens the
relationship as long-term logistics outsourcing relationship
should encourage trade-offs, trust, and beneficial synergies
(Bolumole, 2001; Juntunen, Grant, & Juga, 2010; Mitra,
2006). The 3PL relationship concerns bother on service
integration, relationship solutions, and dependency issues,
and would require interorganizational relationship manage-
ment which takes cognizance of collaboration, integration,
and cultural elements in such relationships (Boyson, Corsi,
Dresner, & Rabinovich, 1999; Chu & Wang, 2012; Lai
et al., 2013; Sohail & Malikakkal, 2011).
Achieving improved 3PL service satisfaction and perfor-
mance requires effective use of power in the social exchange
with suppliers, efficient management of "economic transac-
tions" with suppliers, and good "relationship-specific invest-
ments" (Tian et al., 2008; Ulrich & Barney, 1984). Customer
orientation--the propensity of the service provider to attend to
the service user's needs--and dependability--the 3PL provid-
er's ability to offer regularly adequate services and the capabil-
itytoamenddeliverablestoalignwiththeuser'spreferences--are
critical in 3PL relationship (Anderson, Coltman, Devinney, &
Keating, 2011; Leahy, Murphy, & Poist, 1995; Leuschner et al.,
2014; Tian, Ellinger, & Chen, 2010). Communication, collab-
orative monitoring of service performance, and "long-term rela-
tionship" are equally important in managing logistics
outsourcing as they deliver sustainable performance, create
opportunity for early resolution of conflicts, and provide chan-
nels for relationship severance without the rigors of legal and
commercial battles (Boyson et al., 1999; Paulraj & Chen, 2007).
This, however, will work better in relationships that last long
enough to encourage moral and financial investments for con-
flict resolutions.
Dependency theory (DT) and NT in 3PL relationships.Through
DT, organizations depend on external suppliers or vertically
integrated processes to enhance their supply chain effective-
ness and efficiency, thus gaining competitive advantage via
3PL(Carneiro et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2013). Vertical integration
in logistics is better through processes and systems integration
as it enables flexibility in competitive environments. Thus,
integration and interorganizational relationships would reduce
management processes and asset ownership, improving finan-
cial performance and dependence in 3PL, which aligns with
Zacharia et al.'s (2011) argument on NT. Consistent with these
positions, Rabinovich et al. (1999) argue that logistics out-
sourcing improves customer services, information coordina-
tion, and economies of scale and scope. Boyson et al. (1999),
however, observe that specific management skills are impor-
tant in mitigating failures in 3PL relationships management.
In Nigeria, do the IOCs have the in-house capabilities to
manage the interorganizational relationships with 3PL pro-
viders and do they have the capabilities to form a vertical
integration in 3PL processes to gain such dependencies that
would guarantee a strategic supply chain solution through
the 3PL? This is the basis for Research Question 2: Are in-
house capabilities available in IOCs for managing the 3PL?
Etokudoh et al. 5
Change Management Perspective of 3PL
Adoption by OICs
Using 3PL services implies a change from the traditional in-
house operations. It involves shrinking internal logistics
activities and shifting same to the 3PL providers.
Uncertainties, fears, and frustration from this, along with
long-held practices and routines, may increase employees'
unwillingness to change (Bhatnagar et al., 1999; Gondo,
Patterson, & Palacios, 2013; Mitra, 2006; Sohal et al., 2002).
According to Self et al. (2007), the organizational content,
organizational processes, and organizational context of
change do influence how employees react to organizational
change. Organizational content of change implies the impact
such a change has on employees, and can cause affective and
cognitive resistance. Organizational processes can also
change during 3PL transition; as IOCs use structured plat-
forms, developing new standards and processes for 3PL
implementation could drive employee behavioral resistance.
Also, contextually global competitiveness and internal pro-
cess improvements during 3PL outsourcing can cause
employee resistance. Change management process and prac-
tices may thus be important during 3PL adoption.
Scarce Research on Emerging Economies and Oil
Industry
Much 3PL research has focused on the developed countries
mostly on services and manufacturing industries with noth-
ing on 3PL outsourcing in the oil industry (Arroyo et al.,
2006; Rahman, 2011; Zacharia et al., 2011). This is further
heightened by the employees'likely negative reaction to 3PL
outsourcing (Boohene & Williams, 2012; Rahman, 2011). In
fact, referring to social sustainability, Hosang (2017) identify
employees as one of the main drivers whose welfare and
well-being are of concern to various stakeholders including
government.
Global Outsourcing (2015) lists the commonly outsourced
functions to include "information technology tasks such as
microchip development as well as many business services
such as finance and accounting, human resources, data entry,
and customer support centers" (p. 1) and do not include the
Oil and Gas industry per say. Knowledge localization results
in regions having expertise in certain activities, and there are
sector-driven unique logistics solutions (Almeida & Kogut,
1999; Holguin-Veras et al., 2012; Laursen, Masciarelli, &
Prencipe, 2012). The oil sector has its peculiar logistics chal-
lenges such as oil exporting country-specific economic prac-
tices, oil-related environmental issues, and monopolistic
influences, making oil exporting countries perform poorly in
logistics (Carneiro et al., 2010; Hilmola, 2011).
However, emerging economies have huge growth oppor-
tunities with the potential to develop their local competencies
and step up their professionalism (PricewaterhouseCoopers,
2010). Nigeria is an emerging economy and 15th largest oil
producer with poor infrastructure, poor policy implementa-
tion, lack of technological and human resources, and bureau-
cracy which could hamper logistics (Hilmola, 2011; Ugboaja,
2010). Nigeria currently has a logistics hub for oil and gas
operations which can contribute to knowledge build-up and
support collaboration between 3PL providers and users
(Sheffi, 2012). Oko and Obasi (2014) carry out research on
logistics in Nigeria but their focus was on the manufacturing
industry. Wright et al. (2017) carry out a study on 3PL out-
sourcing in some African countries including Nigeria but was
on the service industry. They, however, acknowledge that use
of 3PL in Nigeria has potential benefits to customers. No 3PL
research is made on the Oil and Gas industry in Nigeria
(Rahman, 2011). This justifies the need to research on this
phenomenon in Nigeria and particularly in the oil industry.
Research Methodology
Design, methods, and philosophy are critical in management
research to enable objective inferences from inputs emanat-
ing from "social actors" (Miller & Tsang, 2011; Wahyuni,
2012). Methodology covers the participants and sites, the
role of the researcher, data gathering techniques, data analy-
sis process, and trustworthiness of the method.
Research Methodology
Traditionally, 3PL research involves large samples for empir-
ical measures and evidential facts, thus quantitative approach
is common (Arroyo et al., 2006; Rahman, 2011; Tian et al.,
2008). However, unlike such cases which test the applicabil-
ity of established processes under different scenarios, this
research seeks to achieve deeper understanding of how 3PL,
a known concept in transportation services, would work in a
specialized oil industry under unique and challenging emerg-
ing market environment--making exploratory, case study
method a preferred option which is already proven excellent
tool for logistics research (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, &
Jackson, 2012; Ellram, 1996; Zacharia et al., 2011). To
address credibility issue about generalization which is criti-
cized in single case studies, multicase approach involves
more than one organization.
Table 1 compares the quantitative approach and the quali-
tative approach. Where "detailed explanation of best prac-
tices" is being sought, exploratory, qualitative methods are
better options (Ellram, 1996). Such approaches allow the
observer to be part of the process he or she is observing, tak-
ing into consideration the observer's (human) interest, and
thus be able to accommodate elements of subjectivity. Rather
than using statistics, they enable the observer to gather data
and form ideas, thus supporting sense making.
Justification for using case study method. In line with the goal
of this article to gain deeper understanding of the IOCs'chal-
lenges and proffer effective ways to manage 3PL within

Participants and Sites
Where participants came from.Three OICs were investi-
gated, along with three of the 3PL providers that render the
logistics services to the OICs. A total of 40 participants were
selected using convenience sampling. Discriminate sampling
process was used to systematically select eligible candidates
and organizations to avoid bias and/or lack of precision
which are associated with convenience sampling (Easterby-
Smith et al., 2012).
Sampling--Who the participants were.A total of 10 partici-
pants were interviewed from one IOC, while five partici-
pants were interviewed in each of the other two IOCs. All the
20 participants from the IOCs were either from the logistics
or procurement functions: three were managers, two heads of
units, two planners, seven 3PL contract holders (CH), and six
logistics staff or those supporting logistics function.
From the service providers, one of the providers was a
major 3PL service contractor providing integrated logistics ser-
vices to all the OICs under investigation. Ten participants were
interviewed, including two managers, three relationship offi-
cers, three heads of logistics operations, and two logistics per-
sonnel.Atotal of five participants each from the remaining two
3PL providers were interviewed including their chief executive
officers (2), heads of different operations (4), heads of client
services (2), and other personnel involved in operations (4).
Table 2 shows the different participants in the research
interview and their roles in 3PL in their organizations, justi-
fying their eligibility and inclusion in the interview process
and a check against research bias by the researcher's active
involvement.
Access to participants. Convenience sampling was used in this
research for easy access to participants based on determined
nonprobability parameters and availability (Ozdemir, St
Louis, & Tophas, 2011), using their work experience and the
researcher's network and relationships in the oil industry.
Criteria for choice of participants. Different participants were
chosen with emphasis on their roles in 3PL services that are
linked to the research problems:
i. The logistics managers and procurement managers of
the IOCs were relevant in relationship issues and
change management in the 3PL.
ii. The executives and commercial managers were rele-
vant in providing insights into the issues with client
interface and relationship management.
iii. The holders of 3PL contracts in the IOCs were
involved because of their knowledge of the capability
of their organizations to manage the 3PL contracts.
iv. Employees involved in logistics operations were key
in understanding internal organizational challenges
that could rob on the 3PL operations.
Ethical issues.Ethical issues exist regarding information
gathering in Nigeria's oil industry. Approval was obtained
from Department of Petroleum Resources, the organization
that served as a major joint venture partner to the IOCs, for
the research's information gathering. Also, pre-interview
question samples were sent ahead of the interview to help
participants understand interview trend. A commitment to
maintain absolute confidentiality of participants and organi-
zations was also given, thus the noninclusion of participants'
and organizations' details in the research.
Data Gathering Techniques
According to in-depth interviews, purposive sampling and
recording of interviews were used in line with case study

methodology (Andrade, 2009; Runeson & Host, 2009).
Initial pilot tests were conducted to develop interview ques-
tions which were further tested with another set of partici-
pants to confirm clear understanding of interviews. Eleven
and 10 open-ended and progressive questions were used as
guide in the interview sessions with the IOCs and 3PL ser-
vice providers, respectively (Apendices A and B), and sent to
participants ahead of interviews. Purposive sampling method
was used to determine participants' qualification, ensuring
their eligibility, along with quota sampling method in which
participants were categorized by their roles/positions.
Following approval from the Department of Petroleum
Resources - Nigerian government regulatory agency for oil
and gas activities (DPR), organizations were contacted and
dates for interviews scheduled, interviews were held and
recorded serially on paper, and data properly labeled for
identification and processing.
Data Analysis Process
Recorded discussions were reviewed severally using the
constant comparison method; data were compared across
different participants' and commonalities drawn to gain in-
depth understanding. Iterative process was also employed, in
which participants were contacted more than once for clarifi-
cation where necessary and the information combined with
other participants' for better understanding.
Trustworthiness of the Method Used
Validity of both method and data.Research methods need to
guarantee the acceptability and transferability of a research
(Easterby-Smith et al., 2012; Brannen & Nilsen, 2011; Moss
et al., 2004). Internal validity, producing similar understanding
under different tests, was assured through use of various meth-
ods including convenience, constant comparison, and iterative
methods to ensure proper representation of participants and
better understanding of issues thus minimizing biases. External
validity, producing similar results outside research environ-
ment, was assured by use of pretesting process for external
clarity and engagement of 40 participants across six organiza-
tions well beyond the eight interviews that are considered ade-
quate for data dependability (Zacharia et al., 2011).
Reliability of method. Reliability, the ability of an experiment to
provide consistent measurements across different tests, was
guaranteed through rigorous and transparent constant compari-
son and iterative approaches of data collection and analysis,
along with the pretesting and interview question refining exer-
cises. This assurance of data consistency further adds credence
to the generalizability of the research (Moss et al., 2004).
Generalizability. Case study method generates a lot of debate
on generalizability--research outcome being applicable out-
side a given experiment--because of its relatively small
sample size (Moss et al., 2004), but with proper representa-
tion generalizability is achievable (Brannen & Nilsen, 2011;
Wood, 2009). Multicase study method involving three out of
six IOCs in Nigeria (50% of industry population) and a bal-
anced approach that included 3PL providers were used. This
provided "transparency and rigours" of processes that make
for research generalizability (Brannen & Nilsen, 2011).
Presentation of Results and Data
Analysis
This session provides findings and in-depth analysis of data
using a "systematic approach (and) reliable platform" that
would address concerns of inconsistencies associated with
differing results in social contexts ( Moss et al., 2004).
Findings and Analysis
Outsourcing of logistics services. Table 3 shows the number of
participants and how they were selected. The table consists
of participants from both IOCs and 3PL providers, their
roles, and how they were distributed. Twenty participants
representing 50% were chosen from the IOCs, and another
50% from the 3PL providers. A total of 5% of the partici-
pants were Executives from the 3PL providers. Managers
interviewed were 13% of the total population, 8% from the
IOCs and 5% from the service providers. In all, 27% of the
participants were Heads of Departments or Planners, 10%
from the IOCs, and 17% from the service providers. A total
of seven CH were interviewed representing 17% of the popu-
lation, all from the IOCs. Five Relationship Officers from
3PL providers were interviewed, representing 13% of the
population. In all, 25% of the population interviewed were
ordinary employees, 15% from the IOCs and 10% from the
service providers.
The participants were asked if their organizations adopted
3PL outsourcing or if they provided such outsourced services
to the IOCs. In all, 100% confirmed there were outsourced 3PL
services within the oil industry and particularly in the IOCs.

Outsourcing of logistics services from the IOCs' perspective.As
shown in Figure 1, the degree of outsourcing varied across
the IOCs and among the different activities.
The table shows the percentage of outsourcing in Land
Transport, Marine Transport, International Freights, Aviation
Services, and Local Port Handling. For confidentiality, the
OICs are referred to as Company A, Company B, and
Company C. Company A outsourced its Land and Marine
Transport operations, representing 33% of its Land and
Marine activities while it handled request processing and
planning. Company B outsourced its request processing,
planning, and execution of the same services representing
60% but vetted all plans and also participated partly in the
execution including owning some of the logistics equipment
used for the operations. Company C owned most of the
marine and land transport equipment, and also participated in
operations and vetting of plans. Actual activities outsourced
by Company C were planning and request processing, with
little of execution and equipment ownership, representing
40% of the activities.
Aviation services included 10 activities: request process-
ing, scheduling, booking, baggage handling, maintenance,
communication with technical team/crew, ownership of spe-
cific facilities, flight operations, manifest publication, and
management of the health and safety (HSE) aspects of the
operations for noncommercial flights. Companies A and C
outsourced 90% of the activities, retaining only the HSE
aspect, while Company B outsourced 80% retaining resource
ownership and HSE aspects.
International Freight services were also almost entirely out-
sourced. Companies A and B outsourced 60% of the activities
consisting of freight collection, transportation, and Customs
clearance, and retained Customs duty payment and documen-
tations. Company C outsourced 100% of International Freight.
There were, however, exceptional cases where those roles
were either reversed or they complement each other in all the
three IOCs. Local Ports Handling operation was 100% out-
sourced by the IOCs.
Overall, Companies B and C perceived there were huge
opportunities in the future. This included full outsourcing in
almost all the components of logistics service.
Outsourcing of logistics services from the 3PL providers' perspec-
tive.Figure 2 shows the percentage averages of the out-
sourced activities being wholly handled by the service
providers across all operations. Port Operations and Manage-
ment of Equipment are 100% handled by service providers in
all operations that include Marine Services, Land Transport,
and Port Operations. Ownership of Equipment scored 37%
for Marine Services, the lowest in all the activities. On aver-
age, Land Transport recorded 88% of outsourced services
wholly handled by service providers, followed by Port Oper-
ations with 83%, and lastly Marine Services at 81%.
Benefits and challenges of 3PL in O&G.Participants were
equally interviewed on what they considered as benefits of
3PL outsourcing and what constituted challenges in effec-
tively implementing the process. The benefits and challenges
of outsourcing are presented in Table 4. The table consists of
percentages of respondents from the IOCs and 3PL providers
according to the identified benefits or challenges.
Both the IOCs and the 3PL providers agreed that there
were benefits from the outsourcing of logistics services by
the IOCs. The IOCs recorded highest scores of 95% on pro-
fessionalism and resource optimization, and 90% in effi-
ciency. The service providers recorded 100% on
professionalism, efficiency, resource optimization, shared
costs, and organizational strategy.
No IOC participants agreed that micro managing service
providers or their organizational cultural differences were a
challenge; rather, they felt such was strength in enforcing
their organizational standards. Comparatively, the service
providers scored 85% and 60%, respectively, indicating they
were important challenges for them. Similarly, the IOCs
scored low in information flow and staff changes, unlike the
service providers that scored 100% and 85%, respectively.
Overall, average of 76% of respondents accepted there
were benefits in outsourcing, with six activities recording
80% and above. In all, 65% indicated challenges in outsourc-
ing, with four activities scoring above 70%.
Nigerian environment.Interview was carried out on recur-
ring issues emanating from the Nigerian environment, and
the findings as perceived by respondents from both IOCs
and 3PL providers are presented in Table 5. The table shows
the percentage of participants from the IOCs and 3PL pro-
viders who responded on given environmental factors, and
also gives average of these respondents for each environ-
mental factor.
Figure 1. Activity outsourcing by IOCs.

Etokudoh et al. 9
Six key environmental issues were identified as negatively
impacting 3PL outsourcing in O&G with average score of
76%. Poor infrastructure, insecurity in the oil producing area,
and host community interference on 3PL contracting scored
80% and above. Highest score in IOCs was 100% in IOCs for
insecurity and community issues, while lowest was 55% for
high cost of operations. For the service providers, highest
score of 95% was recorded in poor infrastructure and lowest
of 50% in underdeveloped market for logistics outsourcing.
Organizational resources for 3PL. Table 6 gives the percentages
of participants that responded on whether given resources were
required for logistics outsourcing and if the IOC owned these
resources. Participants identified relationship and contract

management skills, training resources, and information tech-
nology as important resources required for 3PL implementa-
tion by the IOCs in Nigeria. Relationship skill was considered
by most participants (90%), followed by training and develop-
ment resources (80%). In all, 63% of participants accepted that
the IOCs have relationship skills to manage 3PL outsourcing,
while only 45% accepted that information technology for man-
aging 3PL existed in IOCs.
Employee response to logistics outsourcing. In all, 75% of par-
ticipants acknowledged that employees were reluctant to
accept the transfer of activities they were doing in-house to
external parties. Interestingly, 100% of respondents from the
IOCs stated that resistance from employees was unlikely to
lead to failure of implementation of 3PL outsourcing by their
organizations.
Managing potential for failure.Participants were asked to
assess the tendency for logistics outsourcing to derail or fail
outright and how the potential is managed.
Average of 65% of participants acknowledged the possibil-
ity of failure of 3PL outsourcing unless it is effectively man-
aged. Likely failure was attributed to either employee-related
issues or vendor-related issues. Table 7 indicates the resources
participants considered that the IOCs were using to manage
3PL from failing. For employee-related issues, information
management (58% of respondents), exit strategy (40%), and
top management involvement (70%) were identified. For ven-
dor-related issues, effective contract management (70%) and
direct support to vendors (85%) were identified.
Discussion of Findings
Discussions on the data are presented here. The discussion is
broken into logistics outsourcing, 3PL benefits, and chal-
lenges of 3PL in O&G; Nigerian environment and organiza-
tional resources for 3PL; and employee response to 3PL and
managing potential for failure.
Logistics outsourcing, 3PL benefits, and challenges of 3PL in
O&G. From the findings, logistics outsourcing was already in
practice in the O&G in Nigeria. Benefits identified are similar
to those reported by Arroyo et al. (2006), Rabinovich et al.
(1999), and Rahman (2011) such as efficiency (saving cost
from logistics operations), professionalism (focusing on core
business areas), resource optimization (not tying their invest-
ments on logistics resources and assets), specialized service
delivery and delivery speed (ability to access professional
logistics services with guaranteed efficiency and effective-
ness), and service integration (flexibility in operations).
Result, however, records highest responses on profession-
alism, resource optimization, and efficiency compared with
Sohal et al.'s (2002) customer service, flexibility, and sav-
ings in investment, and Rahman's (2011) cost reduction, sav-
ings in investment, and flexibility. It is suspected that the
difference could be because these other researchers investi-
gated routine product distribution­driven organizations,
unlike the O&G where logistics demands are inconsistent
and thus logistics resource optimization critical. Moreover,
their study was based in a developed country Australia with
established efficiency factors. Nigeria is a developing coun-
try constrained with logistics inefficiencies (Hilmola, 2011),
thus professionalism and efficiency would be critical.
Resource optimization was of particular interest in the
O&G. IOCs are sharing some marine logistics assets and han-
dling and lifting equipment with other organizations.
Outsourcing would enable them release huge resources from
assets that are underutilized. This is consistent with Rahman's
(2011) findings that 3PL services reduce both operational cost
of services and capital costs of investment. In addition, O&G
logistics demands are unpredictable and urgent requiring pro-
fessional, flexible, and effective services which the 3PL pro-
viders are better equipped to provide (Girma & Gorg, 2004;
Lieb et al., 1993; Rahman, 2011; Zacharia et al., 2011). With
the IOCs deploying their relationship management capabili-
ties, right integration between 3PL providers and the IOCs is
expected to produce better flexibility, increased productivity,
and customer satisfaction (Chiung-Lin and Pei-Yu, 2016).
Challenges such as information flow, micro managing
(control), and differences in organizational cultures are
consistent with Lieb et al.'s (1993) findings. However, ven-
dor capability, information flow, and JVP interventions
identified as three challenges most participants selected in
the result differ from those identified by Sohal et al. (2002).
These differences are also attributable to the differences in
geographical locations. Such differences underlie the

uniqueness in country characteristics, highlighting the need
to recognize differences in the application of 3PL outsourc-
ing across the borders (Arroyo et al., 2006).
The benefits of 3PL in Nigeria justify the need to retain
these services. IOCs in Nigeria are contending with pipeline
failures due to activities from illegal operators. They also
face environmental issues such as pollution and losses from
theft. By outsourcing logistics, they would be focused on
technology development in the O&G that can address these
concerns (Rabinovich et al., 1999; Sohal et al., 2002).
How challenges in IOCs impact benefits of 3PL.The unique
challenges observed in the findings suggest that peculiarities
in 3PL application could cause country-specific challenges
in 3PL implementation (Arroyo et al., 2006). This leads to
the Research Question 1: What challenges do the IOCs face
in managing 3PL in Nigeria?
IOCs operate with global standards and require compe-
tent 3PL vendors with adequate resources to implement these
standards in IOC-related logistics operations, but the
Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (Local
Content) Act 2010 mandates exclusive consideration of local
services organizations for O&G operations (Ovadia, 2013).
Consistent with existing reports (Hilmola, 2011; Ihua, 2010),
findings indicate that local logistics vendors lack adequate
capability for logistics services for the IOCs in Nigeria.
Contrary to Ihua (2010), evidence from this research con-
firms that IOCs do provide capacity-building support, such
as liaison with banks for local vendor funding, advanced
payment for services, consultancy, and training. This sug-
gests a new drive by the IOCs to overcome their logistics
constrains that tend to hinder their operations while gradu-
ally implementing the Local Content Act 2010 (Ovadia,
2013). This also aligns with Yang and Zhao (2016) findings
that integration as a new form of relationship management in
logistics outsourcing in unpredictable environments like
Nigeria is beneficial for financial improvement and customer
satisfaction.
Personnel training was an interesting discovery. In all,
67% of the 3PL providers were found to have their personnel
trained by the IOCs, suggesting that most 3PL providers
depended on the IOCs for the capacity building. Thus,
knowledge gap may have been more of a challenge for the
3PL providers than for the IOCs.
Closely related to the capacity of local vendors was the
JVP's influence on the choice of strategy for 3PL outsourc-
ing and the sourcing of local vendors for the services. The
JVP hold majority shares in the joint venture partnership
with the IOCs, enabling them to exert influence on the
IOCs' decisions at the expense of ethically embedded cul-
ture of established organizations (Rossouw & Van Vuuren,
2003). IOCs have to develop internal mechanisms for man-
aging these challenges. This explains why the IOCs were
found to design capability assessment processes to identify
gaps among the local vendors and provide corresponding
capacity-building support. It was interesting to observe that
the IOCs sometimes rejected JVP's choices on vendors,
bearing alone the cost of investing on their preferred ven-
dors. This aligns with Rossouw and Van Vuuven's (2003)
totally aligned organization that upholds its ethical standard
at all cost.
Although information management has been considered a
critical factor in 3PL outsourcing (Leahy et al., 1995; Paulraj
& Chen, 2007; Rabinovich et al., 1999; Somuyiwa &
Adewoye, 2010), emphasis has been on 3PL provider's abil-
ity to provide robust and effective information platform.
Findings from this research indicate service providers are
looking up to the IOCs, because of 3PL providers' inade-
quate resources.
In summary and in response to the Research Question 1,
the IOCs do face challenges in managing 3PL outsourcing in
Nigeria mostly because of the peculiarity of service and con-
ditions in the country. The IOCs have their internal mecha-
nism for managing these challenges. In addition, there are
numerous benefits of 3PL outsourcing in O&G that the IOCs
are enjoying currently despite the current challenges of man-
aging the process. Evidence from this research indicates the
IOCs are looking forward to further exploiting the opportu-
nities of engaging in full 3PL outsourcing compared with
their currently predominantly partial 3PL outsourcing preva-
lent in the O&G in Nigeria.
Nigerian environment and organizational resources for 3PL.It
would have been expected that the Nigerian environmental
uncertainties, poor transportation infrastructure/regulation,
and unpredictable O&G logistics demands would be a major
impediment to IOCs' 3PL outsourcing because of their influ-
ence on supply chain strategies (Paulraj & Chen, 2007;
Ugboaja, 2010). The result, however, shows it was the 3PL
providers that emphasized the criticality of this factor and
not the IOCs. The IOCs see them as service providers' capa-
bilities development opportunities, which is consistent with
Hilmola's (2011) argument for logistics-unfriendly countries
to learn best practices. In addition, OIC's shifting the risks
associated with environmental uncertainties could be their
motivation for 3PL (Girma & Gorg, 2004).
Shifting some risk managements to 3PL providers could
be a channel for the service providers to develop shared
resources. This is consistent with Transaction Cost
Economics and Resource-Based Theory schools of thought
about business owners' decision on transaction cost reduc-
tion and organizational resource combination for higher per-
formance (Zacharia et al., 2011). The 3PL shared resources
enhance IOCs'concentration on core competence, increasing
performance, and increase vendors' operations scale and
scope, creating huge growth opportunities in the emerging
economies (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010).
IOCs would still have to contend with some of the risks
the service providers may not be able to handle. It makes
sense then for the IOCs to want to handle the
12 SAGE Open
environment-driven negative factors that have to do with
vendor characteristics as shown in the findings, while sup-
porting them to grow the capacities they already have. This
is most effective if specific competencies that have direct
bearings with the O&G logistics operations are developed to
assist in knowledge localization and development of logis-
tics hubs for O&G (Almeida & Kogut, 1999; Zacharia et al.,
2011). Logistics hub for O&G operations already exists in
the Oil & Gas Free Trade Zone located in the oil producing
region of the country (Sheffi, 2012).
What organizational resources do the IOCs need to own.The
question, then, is if the IOCs really need to own all logistics-
related resources.Answering this would address the Research
Question 2: Are in-house capabilities available in the IOCs
for managing 3PL?
The IOCs would be holding excess capacity should they
retain resources meant for functions handled by the 3PL.
From the findings, management of communities, vendors,
and contracts were considered key for the IOCs. Consistent
with Boyson et al. (1999), Tian et al. (2008), and Lai et al.
(2013), successful 3PL outsourcing practice requires sound
management resources associated with managing these
interfaces.
Managing communities are similar to managing vendors.
Managing 3PL contracts would, however, require additional
skills such as the ability to scope contracts properly, specify
clear responsibilities, avoid unrealistic promises and
demands, and make provisions for recouping investment
through agreements that encourage future benefits
(Ackerman, 1996). The 3PL providers argued during the
interviews that the IOCs needed logistics operations skills.
Their view is supported by Boyson et al. (1999) report that
logistics skills are important for managing logistics outsourc-
ing. IOCs, however, can draw from their social exchange
power and management capabilities for their 3PL outsourc-
ing (Ulrich & Barney, 1984). Logistics skills needed for the
effective management of the 3PL providers through daily
interaction with the providers can be acquired as a dynamic
learning capability, and as pointed out by Lin and Wu (2014),
this kind of learning process significantly improves perfor-
mance. As the findings suggest and in line with reports on
international organizations (Lai et al., 2013), skills and
resources for contract, integration, and relationship manage-
ment exist among the IOCs.
Ackerman (1996) argues though that individual manag-
ers'personal interest could influence the outcome of logistics
outsourcing. Such behaviors were reported during the inves-
tigation but were minor. Such tendencies would only have
minimal impact among the IOCs possibly because of the
dominant and impulsively replicated positive behaviors
(Gondo et al., 2013) existing in these companies.
However, the results show the IOCs currently manage
3PL piecemeal. They may need to scale up their capability
for managing huge and integrated 3PL services in the future.
Therefore, in response to Research Question 2, it is con-
cluded that the capabilities IOCs require for managing 3PL
would be mostly those resources for managing communities,
vendors, and contracts. Key logistics operations capabilities
may not be prerequisites, because in the course of managing
the contracts, the critical logistics operations will be avail-
able on need-to-know basis. The IOCs do have basic
resources for managing 3PL outsourcing, but they would
likely need to develop the capability further to enable larger
scale outsourcing management.
Employee response to 3PL and managing potential for fail-
ure.Findings indicated that initially employees from the
IOCs were not favorably disposed to 3PL outsourcing. This
is common in 3PL as a change process with employees'
uncertainties, fears, and reinforced old behaviors (Boohene
& Williams, 2012; Gondo et al., 2013; Lozano, 2013; Mari-
ana, Daniela, & Nadina, 2013; Mittal, 2012; Rahman, 2011;
Sohal et al., 2002).
Interestingly, the IOCs were reported to be effective in
managing communication. They understand and apply con-
cepts of communication and change management in their
dealing with employees (Mittal, 2012). Also, in line with
Self et al.'s (2007) explanation, the IOCs may be succeeding
in the outsourcing process because they have been able to
align organizational content of 3PL outsourcing and the
organizational processes for implementing it with the organi-
zational context for the change in a seamless manner that
would be better appreciated and accepted by the employees.
Managing potential failures and employee impact. An interest-
ing outcome from the interview was that respondents from
both the IOCs and the 3PL providers were in agreement that
IOCs had not recorded failures in the implementation of any
3PL outsourcing initiatives as a result of employee resis-
tance. It would have been expected that IOCs with large
workforce would have challenges pushing through with
changes that the employees were reluctant to adopt. So why
is this different in the case of IOCs in Nigeria? In attempting
to answer this, the Research Question 3 will be addressed:
How would the employees respond to 3PL outsourcing?
Several researches uphold that 3PL outsourcing lead to
negative impacts on employees and thus likely to lead to
resistance (Boohene & Williams, 2012; Lozano, 2013;
Rahman, 2011; Sohal et al., 2002). As much as 40% to 80%
logistics personnel have been reported to be impacted by 3PL
outsourcing (Rahman, 2011; Sohal et al., 2002), with serious
post implementation impact including lowering of morale.
The findings show that extending 3PL services to inte-
grated package would meet negative response but such resis-
tance was unlikely to result in failure of 3PL outsourcing
implementation. Lieb et al. (1993) report similar deviation
and linked it to good relationship management. It implies
that the IOCs appreciate the import of employee contribution
to firm success (Hosang, 2017), have sound skills in change
Etokudoh et al. 13
management, can coordinate the change through expert
change agents, and are able to motivate employees toward
such change (Boyson et al., 1999; Mariana et al., 2013). In
sum, regarding Research Question 3, employees in IOC are
likely to respond unfavorably to large-scale logistics out-
sourcing. However, because the IOC have excellent resources
for managing change effectively, such reactions are likely to
be contained. Thus, resistance from employees would not
result in failure of implementation of 3PL outsourcing.
Conclusion
The article reveals that the IOCs face challenges in imple-
menting 3PL outsourcing in Nigeria, their peculiar logistics
needs, and the unique local conditions. Challenges identi-
fied include 3PL providers' capability to deliver O&G-
specific logistics services, JVP influence in 3PL
implementation, and information management between
IOCs and the service providers. The IOCs have internal
mechanisms to manage these challenges. Moreso, 3PL out-
sourcing benefits outweigh these challenges, justifying 3PL
outsourcing by IOCs in Nigeria.
The article also establishes that Nigeria has unique
logistics issues such as underdeveloped logistics market,
host community challenges, and poor transportation infra-
structure. However, it was revealed that the IOCs only
needed relationship and contract management capabilities
for managing vendor development, contract management,
and the management of communities which were logistics
challenges not within 3PL capabilities. The IOCs currently
use them in managing outsourced fragmented logistics ser-
vices, but need further development for integrated logistics
services.
Contrary to most existing literature, IOC employees may
respond negatively initially to 3PL outsourcing but would
end up accepting it. The IOCs have developed good manage-
ment practices that enable them manage employee issues
effectively during 3PL outsourcing implementation. There
are job losses during such exercises, but employees are usu-
ally prepared to eventually accept the change. This experi-
ence is unique and calls for further studies for possible
adoption outside the IOCs.
The findings obtained therefrom add to the existing
research on 3PL across national dimension from the IOCs
with the Nigerian perspective. Thus, the research contributes
to the body of knowledge in the field of international busi-
ness and logistics outsourcing.
Implications of the Research
The outcome of the research has some implications. First,
academically it debunks the long-held tradition that global
organizations should always deploy their global standards
and best practices across borders to achieve streamlined
operations, economies of scale and scope, and transparent
processes. Consistent with Schilke, Rehmann, and Thomas
(2009), standardization may not always translate to good
business performance. As the research has shown, the
Nigerian environment requires home-grown resources and
capabilities that call for collaboration between the IOCs and
local vendors that would lead to new capabilities for logistics
operations in the O&G. It equally calls for dynamic learning
capabilities between the IOCs and local vendors to cope with
volatilities in the environment (Lin & Wu, 2014).
Second, it addresses management practices in the IOCs.
Organizations deploy 3PL outsourcing strategies with
expected gains which when not met lead to early termination
of relationships with service providers (Ackerman, 1996;
Boyson et al., 1999). IOCs would need to device new work-
ing relationships with their vendors that would result in their
capacity building. The research throws up the challenge for
managers in IOCs to study and design a win-win partnership
framework. As Yang and Zhao (2016) see it, this is an inno-
vative means of managing logistics outsourcing relation-
ships. IOCs can leverage on the local vendors' capacity to
manage the challenging security in the oil producing areas,
their reticence in coping with the poor logistics infrastructure
in Nigeria to deliver logistics services, and their skill in net-
working with local operators to influence regulations, to
solve their peculiar logistics needs better. IOCs providing
financial and technical support to the growing 3PL providers
in Nigeria can assist in their capacity, improve 3PL services
to the O&G, and develop globally competitive logistics ser-
vice providers.
Third, it emphasizes the importance of change manage-
ment in organizations. Change management tends to focus
on ideas level where consultants work with management
teams of organizations to develop structures and resources
without effective implementation (Parker et al., 2013). There
is apparent lack of academic details in change processes on
complex organizations (Kuipers et al., 2014). The experience
with the IOCs shows that properly designed and imple-
mented change management processes can pay off.
Fourth, it highlights the need for a more robust and all-
inclusive logistics outsourcing strategy by the IOCs to fully
harness the benefits of 3PL outsourcing. An integrated logis-
tics outsourcing with effective information sharing and pro-
cess coordination (Liu, Huo, Liu, & Zhao, 2015) that
provides end-to-end service delivery would be more benefi-
cial to the IOCs (Boyson et al., 1999; Rabinovich et al.,
1999; Zacharia et al., 2011). The research reveals that this
currently is lacking in the O&G in Nigeria. As the research
indicates, however, the IOCs are contemplating such
initiative.
Limitations of the Research
The research methodology was drawn from the case study
method with generalization issues. Also, the interview ses-
sions would introduce the probability of subjective results.
14 SAGE Open
Another limitation came from the restricted mode of access-
ing information in the O&G in Nigeria. The oil and gas regu-
latory bodies in Nigeria imposed bureaucratic constraints to
accessing information, limiting research to three instead of
the six IOCs intended by the researchers.
Despite these limitations, the outcome is tenable. The
multicase study enabled the researcher to use credible meth-
ods for data processing, and to spread the interview across
wide population of respondents, thus minimizing the chances
of subjectivity and increasing its generalization. Concerning
the number of IOCs investigated, the research was able to
cover three of the six IOCs in Nigeria, representing 50% of
the population.
Areas for Further Studies
This article was an exploratory research. Having established
the workability of 3PL outsourcing by IOCs in Nigeria, an
extensive and quantitative research would be required to fur-
ther test the applicability of this established concept under
different scenarios.
Another area for future study would be conducting a more
focused research on employee behavior with respect to 3PL
outsourcing across different industries in Nigeria to deter-
mine if the IOCs' unique result in which the employees tend
to welcome rather than resist outsourcing is industry-specific
or not.
