Abstract
Several studies indicate that screening in combination with lifestyle modification may produce a greater
reduction in colorectal cancer rates than screening alone. To identify national opportunities for the primary
prevention of colorectal cancer, we assessed the prevalence of modifiable lifestyle risk factors in the United
States. We used nationally representative, cross-sectional data from 5 NHANES cycles (1999­2000, n ¼
2,753; 2001­2002, n ¼ 3,169; 2003­2004, n ¼ 2,872; 2005­2006, n ¼ 2,993; 2007­2008, n ¼ 3,438). We
evaluated the 5 colorectal cancer risk factors deemed "convincing" by the World Cancer Research Fund
(obesity, physical inactivity, intake of red meat, processed meat, alcohol), and cigarette smoking, a
"suggestive" risk factor in the Surgeon General's report. We estimated the prevalence of each risk factor
separately and jointly, and report it overall, and by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and year. In 2007 to 2008, 81%
percent of U.S. adults, aged 20 to 69 years, had at least one modifiable risk factor for colorectal cancer. More
than 15% of those younger than 50 years had 3 or more risk factors. There was no change in the prevalence of
risk factors between 1999 and 2008. The most common risk factors were risk factors for other chronic
diseases. Our findings provide additional support for the prioritization of preventive services in health care
reform. Increasing awareness, especially among young adults, that lifestyle factors influence colorectal
cancer risk, and other chronic diseases, may encourage lifestyle changes and adherence to screening
guidelines. Complementary approaches of screening and lifestyle modification will likely provide the
greatest reduction of colorectal cancer. Cancer Prev Res; 5(1); 138­45. Ó2011 AACR.
Introduction
The vision of the recently released National Prevention
Strategy is to move ". . .the nation from a focus on sickness
and disease to one based on prevention and wellness (1)."
Colorectal cancer, which cost an estimated 14 billion dol-
lars in 2010, and accounted for approximately 11% of the
total cost of cancer care (2), is a focus of health care reform.
The prevailing strategy to address colorectal cancer has been
through secondary prevention. Screening average risk
adults 50 years and older has accounted for a large propor-
tion of an overall decline in colorectal cancer incidence and
mortality over the past 3 decades (3). The Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act of 2010 will increase access to
colorectal cancer screening (4), and screening rates will be a
key indicator of the prevention strategy (1). Although the
benefit of screening is clear, there is also extensive evidence
to support increased efforts for primary prevention through
lifestyle modification.
In the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of
Cancer, it was estimated that increased screening in com-
bination with a significant, but achievable, improvement in
lifestyle risk factor prevalence from the rates in 2000 could
reduce colorectal cancer mortality by as much as 50% in
2020 (3). In addition, estimates from a large cohort of
women found that while endoscopic screening can signif-
icantly reduce risk of colorectal cancer, the magnitude of the
risk reduction is less than the reduction for lifestyle and
dietary changes alone (5). In a cohort of men, it was
estimated that as much as 71% of colon cancer risk could
be avoided through modification of a constellation of
lifestyle factors (6). Collectively, this evidence suggests that
the most successful national strategy for colorectal cancer
prevention will include complementary approaches of both
screening and lifestyle modification.
Furthermore, in stark contrast to overall incidence, colo-
rectal cancer incidence among adults under 50 years, and
below the recommended screening age, has increased since

the early 1990s (3, 7). This may be due, in part, to increases
in the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors (7). The current
screening practice for average risk adults will not address
colorectal cancer in this age range; and there is not an
evidence-base to support population-wide screening in
those younger than 50 (8). It is undetermined whether the
health care system currently has the capacity to provide
quality screening even to those 50 and over (9). Thus,
primary prevention of colorectal cancer through lifestyle
modification may be the most effective strategy among
younger adults.
To identify national opportunities for the primary pre-
vention of colorectal cancer, and prioritize targets for pre-
vention by sex, race/ethnicity, and age, we assessed the
prevalence of modifiable lifestyle risk factors in the United
States. We evaluated the prevalence of the 5 "convincing"
risk factors as determined by the World Cancer Research
Fund (i.e., obesity, physical inactivity, and intake of red
meat, processed meat and alcohol; ref. 10), as well as
cigarette smoking, which was classified a suggestive risk
factor in the Surgeon General's report (11), and has been
consistently associated with colorectal cancer risk in pro-
spective studies (12).
Methods
Study population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics, is a nationally representative survey that uses a
multistage stratified, clustered probability sample of the
U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Data is col-
lected through household interviews and in-person exam-
ination at mobile examination centers. We estimated the
national prevalence of colorectal cancer risk factors in
5 of the 2-year survey cycles (1999­2000, n ¼ 4,880;
2001­2002, n ¼ 5,411; 2003­2004, n ¼ 5,041; 2005­
2006, n ¼ 4,979; 2007­2008, n ¼ 5,935). We evaluated
non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB),
and Mexican-American (MA) men and nonpregnant
women, aged 20 to 69 years.
Risk factors
We evaluated 6 colorectal cancer risk factors; obesity,
physical inactivity, and intake of red meat, processed
meat and alcohol, and cigarette smoking. During the
household interview, participants were asked about phys-
ical activity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use. During
the examination, height and weight were measured, and a
24-hour food recall was administered. All factors of
interest, except physical activity, were identically mea-
sured in each cycle.
We calculated body mass index [BMI, (weight, kg)/
(height, m2)] from height and weight measured at the
examination. When height and weight were missing
(1.1% in all cycles), we used self-reported values from
the interview. Participants with a BMI  30.0 kg/m2 were
classified as obese.
Red meat and processed meat intakes were assessed using
a 24-hour recall. One day of 24-hour diet recall was col-
lected until 2003 to 2004, when 2 days of recalls were
collected. To be consistent, we used the first day 24-hour
recall in this study. Daily intake of items containing red
meat (i.e., beef, lamb, and veal; USDA codes: 21, 23, 2711,
2713, 2721, 2723, 2731, 2733, 2741, 2743, 2751, 2761,
2811, 2813), were summed (13). Participants who con-
sumed 2 oz or more were classified as regular red meat
consumers. Daily intake of items containing processed meat
(e.g., frankfurters, sausages, lunchmeats, or meat spreads;
USDA codes: 252, 2756), were summed (13). Participants
who consumed 2 oz or more were classified as regular
processed meat consumers.
Participants were asked about their cigarette smoking
status and usual alcohol intake. We classified smoking in
2 ways: ever and current. Because smoking is thought to
influence colorectal cancer risk after decades, rather than
immediately (12, 14), we classified participants who
smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime as "ever"
smokers. However, because only current smoking behavior
can be modified, we also classified participants who smoked
cigarettes on "most" or "some" days as "current" smokers.
We classified participants who consumed 2 or more alco-
holic beverages on most days as regular alcohol consumers.
Participants were asked about their physical activity
behaviors. From 1999 to 2006, physical activity was uni-
formly measured. Participants were asked to indicate (i)
whether they walked/bicycled for transportation, (ii)
whether they took part in household/yard tasks requiring
at least moderate effort, (iii) all of their recreational activ-
ities, and (iv) the number of minutes and days they spent
doing all (transportation, household, and recreational)
activities. Participants were asked to describe their "usual
daily activities" as one of the following: "sit during day and
do not walk very much," "stand or walk about quite a lot
during day but do not have to carry or lift things very often,"
"lift or carry light loads, or have to climb stairs or hills often"
or "do heavy work orcarry heavy loads." In the 2007 to 2008
cycle, the physical activity questionnaire was changed. As in
the previous cycles, participants were asked whether they
walked/bicycled for transportation, and the number of
minutes and days they spent walking/bicycling. Participants
also reported whether they took part in moderate or vigor-
ous "work" activities (household and occupational activi-
ties), and the number of minutes and days they spent doing
"work" activities. Rather than reporting all recreational
activities, participants reported whether they took part in
moderate or vigorous recreational activities, and the num-
ber of minutes and days they spent doing recreational
activities. For all NHANES cycles, we summed the total
minutes of moderate and vigorous activities per week. Then,
using the 2007 to 2008 physical activity recommendations
(15), we classified participants who completed 150 or more
minutes of moderate or 75 or more minutes of vigorous
activity each week as physically active. Because occupational
activity minutes were not collected from 1999 to 2006,
participants that selected "do heavy work or carry heavy

loads" to describe their usual day were also classified as
physically active.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were done using SUDAAN 9.0
(Research Triangle Park) and SAS v.9.1. Sampling weights
of the smallest subsample (i.e., 24-hour food recall) were
applied to account for the NHANES sampling design,
including oversampling, nonresponse, and poststratifica-
tion. The analyses included participants with complete
information on all risk factors of interest (1999­2000,
n ¼ 2,753; 84.2% of eligible; 2001­2002, n ¼ 3,169;
85.6% of eligible; 2003­2004, n ¼ 2,872; 84.1% of eligible;
2005­2006, n ¼ 2,993; 85.9% of eligible; 2007­2008,
n ¼ 3,438; 87.2% of eligible).
For each NHANES cycle, we estimated the prevalence of
each risk factor(obesity, physical inactivity, ever and current
smoking, and red meat, processed meat, and alcohol
intake) separately. The total number of risk factors was
calculated by summing the 6 risk factors; current smoking,
rather than ever, was used in the total. We compared
differences in the prevalence of the risk factors and the total
number of risk factors by sex, race/ethnicity and age using
the x2 test. Because these factors often cooccur, we also
estimated the joint distribution of the 6 modifiable risk
factors in 2007 to 2008. Of the 64 possible risk factor
combinations ("risk profiles"), we report the 10 most
common ones in the overall study population and in
subpopulations defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and age.
Within each population, at least 60% of the participants
had one of the 10 risk profiles. Given our objective to
prioritize today's colorectal cancer prevention efforts, we
focus the results on the most recent (2007­2008) NHANES
cycle and describe changes in prevalence of the risk factors
over time.
Results
The study population was the estimated U.S. adult pop-
ulation 20 to 69 years of age, which was comprised of 52.0%
women, 77.4% non-Hispanic whites, 12.8% non-Hispanic
blacks, and 9.8% Mexican Americans. When divided into
age categories, 29.8% were 20 to 34 years, 34.6% were 35 to
49 years, and 35.6% were 50 to 69 years.
Prevalence of colorectal cancer risk factors
2007 to 2008. Ever smoking was the most common risk
factor overall (Table 1). Men were more likely to be both
ever and current smokers than women. Non-Hispanic
whites were most likely to be ever smokers. Non-Hispanic
blacks were most likely to be current smokers (P ¼ 0.08).
Although ever smoking was most prevalent among the
oldest age group (50­69 years), current smoking was most
prevalent among the youngest age group (20­34 years).
When considering current smoking rather than ever,
obesity was the most common risk factor overall, followed
closely by physical inactivity. Women had higher preva-
lences of obesity and physically inactivity than men; and
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans had higher
prevalences of obesity and physical inactivity than non-
Hispanic whites. The prevalences of obesity and physical
inactivity increased with age.
Among the dietary risk factors, intake of red meat was the
most common risk factor, followed by processed meat, and
then alcohol. Men were more likely to regularly consume all
3 dietary risk factors than women. Across race/ethnicity
groups, red meat intake was similar, processed meat intake
was highest among non-Hispanic blacks, and alcohol
intake was highest among non-Hispanic whites. Across age
groups, those 20 to 34 years were most likely to consume red
meat, but processed meat and alcohol intake did not differ
by age.
Changes over 1999 to 2008. The prevalences remained
relatively constant over time in the overall study population
and by sex, race/ethnicity, and age (Fig. 1). Between the
1999 and 2008 survey cycles, the prevalence of obesity
increased in the overall study population and within each
subgroup. The prevalence of physical inactivity decreased
over time in the overall study population and within all
subgroups except those aged 50 to 69 years; these results are
based on physical activity assessments that were not
completely consistent over time.
Total number of colorectal cancer risk factors
2007 to 2008. Nineteen percent of the overall popula-
tion had no risk factors, whereas approximately 64% had
1 or 2 risk factors and 17% had 3 or more risk factors
(Table 2). Men had more risk factors than women; approx-
imately 20% of men had 3 or more risk factors as compared
with approximately 15% of women (P ¼ 0.07). The distri-
bution of number of risk factors differed significantly by
race/ethnicity and age groups: non-Hispanic blacks had the
highest prevalence of 3 or more risk factors (23%), fol-
lowed by non-Hispanic whites(16%), and Mexican Amer-
icans (13%). The prevalence of 3 or more risk factors
increased slightly with age (20­34, 16%; 30­49, 17%;
50­69, 18%).
Changes over 1999 to 2008. These patterns were similar
across all 5 NHANES cycles in the overall population and by
sex, race/ethnicity, and age (Supplementary Table S1). The
prevalence of 3 or more risk factors was consistent across
cycles. However, in earlier cycles, the prevalence of having
no risk factors was lower, and the prevalence of one risk
factor was higher, than in later cycles, particularly in men,
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. This differ-
ence was likely due to the corresponding change in the
prevalence of physical inactivity, which was most pro-
nounced in these same subgroups.
Colorectal cancer risk factor profiles
2007 to 2008. Because these risk factors often cooccur,
we also identified the most common risk factor profiles.
Among those with 1 or more risk factor, the top 3 most
common risk profiles were obesity only, physical inactivity
only, and both obesity and physical inactivity; these
were also the most common profiles among women,

69 years (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S2).
Similarly, the top profiles among non-Hispanic whites and
those 35 to 49 years old included obesity and physical
activity, but also current smoking. Among men and young
adults, the top 3 risk profiles were obesity only, red meat
intake only (or their combination), and current smoking.
Discussion
We found that there are many opportunities for the
primary prevention of colorectal cancer in the United States.
In 2007 to 2008, 81% percent of U.S. adults, aged 20 to 69
years, had at least one modifiable risk factor for colorectal
cancer. In the Annual Report to the Nation, it was estimated
that screening, in combination with a considerable reduc-
tion in the 2000 prevalence of lifestyle risk factors could
have a significant impact on colorectal cancer mortality (3).
Yet, we observed no notable improvement in the prevalence
of a subset of those risk factors in the decade between 1999
and 2008. The combination of suboptimal screening rates
and a steady prevalence of lifestyle risk factors suggests that
colorectal cancer rates will not decrease to the extent pos-
sible in the near future. The most prevalent modifiable risk
factors for colorectal cancer, like obesity, are not novel;
these are the same risk factors as for other chronic diseases,
like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our findings do
not signify a need for specialized colorectal cancer lifestyle
interventions, but they do provide additional evidence for
the need for the early intervention and targeted prevention
and wellness services to be developed as part of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (4).
In the clinical setting, the guidelines for colorectal cancer
prevention focus on screening the average risk adult at age
50 (16). However, our data indicate that the conversation
about colorectal cancer risk and prevention needs to start
much earlier. We observed that more than 15% of those
younger than 50, and thus, not recommended for screening,
had 3 or more risk factors. In contrast to overall rates,
colorectal cancer incidence has increased in those younger
than 50 (7). Alerting younger adults about their colorectal
cancer risk based on lifestyle factors provides an opportu-
nity for change. Awareness of personal risk due to lifestyle
risk factors may also increase awareness of the importance
of adherence to screening guidelines at the appropriate age.
Indeed, a growing body of evidence supports the benefit of
simultaneously addressing multiple health behaviors in
health care settings (17­19). Because colorectal cancer
screening is a complex behavior (20); more research is
needed to determine whether increased awareness of life-
style risk factors among young adults would influence
future screening behavior.
Our findings also show that the population subgroups
with the highest burden of colorectal incidence and
mortality also have the greatest opportunity for primary
prevention through lifestyle modification. The total
burden of colorectal cancer risk factors mirrored color-
ectal cancer incidence and mortality rates by sex and
race/ethnicity. Men had a higher total number of risk
factors than women; men also have higher colorectal
cancer incidence and mortality rates than women (21).
Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest total number of risk
factors among the race/ethnicity groups; and African
Americans have the highest colorectal cancer incidence
and mortality (21). Providing access to resources that
encourage appropriate lifestyle changes, and increasing
access to screening, may improve colorectal cancer rates
in those with the highest burden.
We used nationally representative data to estimate the
separate and joint prevalences of risk factors, overall, and by

sex, race/ethnicity, and age over a 10-year period. The data
were cross-sectional; individuals were not followed over
time or for colorectal cancer outcomes. The prevalence of
current smoking that we estimated in NHANES 2007 to
2008 was higher than that reported in the 2007 National
Health Interview Survey (22); our estimate is for a narrower
age range (20­69 years vs. 18þ). We were unable to fully
evaluate physical inactivity time trends because its assess-
ment was changed in the 2007 to 2008 NHANES survey
relative to the 1999 to 2006 surveys. In addition, the 1999 to
2006 surveys incompletely assessed occupational activity,
an activity type that maydiffer across sex, race/ethnicity, age,
and time. Red meat and processed meat intakes were
evaluated using the current state-of-art, 1-day, 24-hour diet
recall, using the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Automat-
ed Multiple Pass Method (23). We used a single 24-hour diet
recall because multiple days were not available for 2 of the 5
NHANES cycles evaluated. Although multiple days of 24-
hour diet recall are needed to assess individuals' usual
intake, this single 24-hour recall is a robust method to
describe the average dietary intake of a group (23).
Improved clinical and community preventive services are
a major aspect of the National Prevention Strategy. Colo-
rectal cancer is a disease with many opportunities for
prevention. Increasing national screening rates is an impor-
tant strategy for reducing the burden of colorectal cancer,
but it should not be the only strategy. We found that the vast
majority of American adults have at least one modifiable
colorectal cancer risk factor. Furthermore, a sizable propor-
tion of those younger than 50 years have several colorectal
cancer risk factors. When advising the public about risks
associated with factors like obesity and cigarette smoking,
colorectal cancer should be included in the discussion.
Increasing the public's awareness that these factors also
impact colorectal cancer risk may enhance efforts to modify
lifestyle, and may further encourage adherence to screening
guidelines. The most successful national strategy for colo-
rectal cancer prevention will likely include complementary
approaches of both screening and lifestyle modification.
