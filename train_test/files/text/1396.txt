There is no general agreement as to whether low-level
lead exposure increases blood pressure. The present
study examined the correlation between blood pressure
and blood lead in the NHANES III database (1988­1994).
Analyses were performed for all adults (20 years), and
reported separately for white males (n = 4685), white
females (n = 5138), black males (n = 1761) and black
females (n = 2197). Significant covariates of blood
pressure were selected by stepwise regression. The
change in blood pressure that would be associated with
a doubling of blood lead was calculated from the
adjusted regression coefficients. Mean systolic/diastolic
blood pressure was 123/76 mm Hg in white males,
119/70 mm Hg in white females, 126/77 mm Hg in black
males and 121/72 mm Hg in black females. Median blood

Introduction
The issue of whether low-level lead exposure results
in elevated blood pressure is still a matter of scien-
tific debate. Contradictory results have been pub-
lished, even when the data from a single study were
analysed by different investigators. For example, in
their analysis of the second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), some
authors reported a significant and positive associ-
ation between blood lead and blood pressure.1­3
Others, however, have questioned the selection cri-
teria and statistical methods applied in these calcu-
lations and found that there was no consistent
relation between blood lead and blood pressure.4
In a recent meta-analysis (23 studies involving
33141 subjects), we reported that at low to moderate
levels of lead exposure, a doubling of the blood lead
concentration was associated with significant but
modest increases in blood pressure, ie 1.0 mm Hg (P
= 0.002) systolic and 0.6 mm Hg (P = 0.02) diastolic.5

203 nmol/L (4.2 g/dL) and 111 nmol/L (2.3 g/dL),
respectively. For a doubling of blood lead, the changes
in systolic blood pressure were 0.3 (95% confidence
interval: -0.2 to 0.7, P = 0.29), 0.1 (-0.4 to 0.5, P = 0.80),
0.9 (0.04 to 1.8, P = 0.04) and 1.2 (0.4 to 2.0, P = 0.004)

pressure were -0.6 (-0.9 to -0.3, P = 0.0003), -0.2 (-0.5
to -0.1, P = 0.13), 0.3 (-0.3 to 1.0, P = 0.28) and 0.5 (0.01
to 1.1, P = 0.047) mm Hg, respectively. In conclusion,
there is no consistent relationship between blood press-
ure and blood lead in the NHANES III dataset.

of subjects not reported) found a significant increase
of 1.2 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure when mean
blood lead doubled.6
The mean blood lead levels in the general popu-
lation (1­74 years) declined from 620 nmol/L (12.8
g/dL) in NHANES II (1976­1980) to 140 nmol/L
(2.9 g/dL) in phase 1 of NHANES III (1988­1991)7
and continued to decline in phase 2 of NHANES III
(1991­1994).8 The unresolved question of a possible
lead-related increase of blood pressure, and the con-
siderable change in blood lead levels over time,
prompted our examination of the relation between
blood lead and blood pressure, using NHANES III
data.
Materials and methods
NHANES III, conducted from 1988 through 1994,
was designed to provide national estimates of the
health and nutritional status of the United States'
civilian, non-institutionalised population aged 2
months and older. The NHANES III database was
obtained on CD-ROM from the National Centre for
Health Statistics. The sampling procedures, examin-
ation procedures, laboratory performance and qual-
ity control measures have been described.9
Blood pressure was measured at the MEC by

Association guidelines10 and was the mean of three
readings in the sitting position. Dietary calcium,
sodium and potassium intake (mg/day) were esti-
mated by a 24-h recall questionnaire. Diabetes was
coded if either disease code (ICD-9) 250 was spe-
cified or if the subject self-reported to have diabetes.
Diuretics, calcium channel blockers, carbonic anhy-
drase inhibitors, beta-blockers, alpha-agonists and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
were defined as antihypertensive drugs. The poverty
index, ie a standardised income variable, was used
as measure for socio-economic status. Since the pov-
erty index had many missing values (1464 (9.5%)
on a total sample of 15431), all analyses were done
with and without inclusion of the poverty index.
Lead in blood (nmol/L) was measured by atomic
absorption spectrometry as described by Miller et
al.11 Serum total protein (g/L), serum total calcium
(mmol/L) and haematocrit (L/L) were measured by
standard procedures.9
Data management and statistical analysis was
done with the SAS software, version 6.12. Subjects
below 20 years and of races other than black or
white were excluded from the analysis. This left us
with a sample size of 18220 subjects, of whom
15431 had at least one valid blood pressure reading.
Separate analyses were done for white males, white
females, black males and black females. The weight-
ing factors available in the dataset were used to
correct for non-responder bias and over- or under-
selection of certain age, gender or race-ethnicity
groups. Data that were not normally distributed, as
tested by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, were log-
transformed and described by the median and inter-
quartile range. In a first step of the analysis, we com-
puted unadjusted regression coefficients between
blood pressure and blood lead using single
regression analysis. Effect sizes with 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated from the regression
coefficients for a doubling of the blood lead concen-
tration. As the association between blood pressure
and blood lead may by confounded by other vari-
ables, in a second step of the analysis, significant
covariables of blood pressure were identified by a
stepwise regression analysis for the four race-gender
groups separately. We made an a priori decision to
include known confounders in the model regardless
of significance, ie age, age2, body-mass index,
haematocrit, smoking, alcohol consumption and use
of antihypertensive drugs. The other variables
(coffee consumption, dietary calcium, dietary
sodium/potassium ratio, serum total protein, serum
total calcium, presence of diabetes and poverty
index) required a 0.05 significance level to enter and
to stay in the stepwise model. Finally, allowing for
significant covariates, the relation between blood
pressure and blood lead was determined by multiple
regression analysis and effect sizes, with 95% con-
fidence intervals, were calculated for a doubling of
the blood lead concentration from the regression
coefficients for blood lead in the multiple
regression analysis.
Results
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and
blood lead levels were significantly higher in blacks
as compared with whites and in males as compared
with females (Table 1). Because blood pressure and
most other characteristics differed according to race
and gender (Table 1), single and multiple regression
analyses were performed in four race-gender groups
separately. A correlation matrix between systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, the blood
lead concentration and all other variables is given
in Table 2.
Without adjustment for confounders, systolic
blood pressures was positively associated with
blood lead concentration (Figure 1), while diastolic
blood pressure showed a weakly positive associ-
ation or no relation with the blood lead concen-
tration (Figure 2). In single regression analysis, a
doubling of the blood lead concentration was asso-
ciated with increases in systolic blood pressure of
2.1 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.6 to 2.5 mm Hg; P  0.001)
in white males, 5.1 mm Hg (4.6 to 5.6 mm Hg; P 
0.001) in white females, 3.8 mm Hg (3.0 to 4.6
mm Hg; P  0.001) in black males and 5.6 mm Hg
(4.8 to 6.5 mm Hg; P  0.001) mm Hg in black
females. Diastolic blood pressure was not signifi-
cantly correlated with blood lead in white males
(-0.3 mm Hg (-0.6 to 0.1 mm Hg; P = 0.08) for a
doubling of the blood lead concentration). However,
in the other race-gender groups, diastolic blood
pressure increased with elevated blood lead levels.
For a doubling of the blood lead concentration, the
estimates were 0.5 mm Hg (0.3 to 0.8 mm Hg; P 
0.001) in white females, 1.1 mm Hg (0.5 to 1.6
mm Hg; P  0.001) in black males, and 1.4 mm Hg
(0.9 to 1.9 mm Hg; P  0.001) in black females.
In multiple regression analysis with adjustment
for important or significant confounders, systolic
blood pressure was positively and independently
correlated with blood lead in black subjects, but not
in white subjects (Table 3). The change in blood
pressure that would be associated with a doubling
of the blood lead concentration was 0.3 mm Hg
(95% Cl: -0.2 to 0.7 mm Hg; P = 0.29) in white
males, 0.1 mm Hg (-0.4 to 0.5 mm Hg; P = 0.80) in
white females, 0.9 mm Hg (0.04 to 1.8 mm Hg; P =
0.04) in black males and 1.2 mm Hg (0.4 to 2.0
mm Hg; P = 0.004) in black females (Figure 3). The
positive relationship between systolic blood press-
ure and blood lead in black males weakened and
became non-significant when the poverty index was
included as an independent covariable in the model.
The effect size associated with a doubling of the
blood lead concentration then was 0.6 (-0.3 to 1.5;
P = 0.23; n = 1619).

regression analysis, the relation between diastolic

Discussion
We used NHANES III data to examine the relation-
ship between blood pressure and blood lead. A sig-
nificant and positive relationship was found
between systolic blood pressure and blood lead, but
only in blacks. The relation between diastolic blood
pressure and blood lead was inconsistent for the dif-
ferent race-gender groups.
Several authors1,2,4 studied the relationship
between blood pressure and blood lead in NHANES
II and reported for a doubling of blood lead a change
in blood pressure ranging from non-significant to a
maximum increase of 5.8 mm Hg (P  0.001) sys-
tolic and 2.7 mm Hg (P  0.001) diastolic. These
contradictory results probably are due to variation
in criteria for including participants in the analysis
(age groups, gender, race), weighting factors, covari-
ates selected as confounders and statistical methods.
Similarly, in the British Regional Heart Study
(BRHS) inconsistent findings depending on statisti-
cal methods and use of covariables were
reported.12,13 The researcher concluded that for a

Blood lead levels in Western countries have
dropped considerably throughout the last decades
due to the reduction of lead in gasoline and in sold-
ered food and drink cans.7,14­16 In the general US

dropped from 620 nmol/L (12.8 g/dL) in NHANES

II (1976­1980) to 140 nmol/L (2.9 g/dL) in the first
phase of NHANES III (1988­1991).7 In Belgium,
mean blood lead levels in a random population sam-
ple (n = 728; 49% men; age range: 20­82 years) aver-
aged 420 nmol/L (8.7 g/dL) in the period 1985­
1989. After a median follow-up of 5.2-years, blood
lead levels had dropped by 32% to a mean value of
140 nmol/L (2.9 g/dL).16 In this prospective popu-
lation study, no consistent association was found
between the change in blood pressure and blood
lead. In addition, the blood lead (or zinc
protoporphyrin) concentration at baseline did not
predict the development of hypertension in the fol-
low-up period.16 These conclusions are in agree-
ment with the current findings in NHANES III, ie
there is no significant relationship between blood
lead levels and blood pressure in white males or
females. Also, in a population with high industrial
exposure levels (mean blood lead levels:
1525 nmol/L (31.6 g/dL)), no significant relation
was found between blood pressure and blood lead
after adjustment for confounders.17
Unlike in white subjects, a significant and positive
association was found between blood pressure and
blood lead in black subjects. This is in agreement
with a prospective study performed in San Franci-
sco bus drivers. Systolic and diastolic blood press-
ure increased significantly with rising blood lead
levels in blacks, but not in whites.18 Also in
Journal of Human Hypertension
NHANES II, race was an important covariable in the
analysis of blood lead and blood pressure.19
Blood lead levels are usually higher in blacks than
in whites. This is often attributed to socio-economic
factors, eg to a higher degree of urbanisation, higher
occupational exposure or housing in older buildings
with lead-containing paint. In NHANES II, however,
black/white differences could not be explained by
demographic or socio-economic factors, since race
differences were found in all age groups, in rural
residents and urban dwellers, and in families with
low, moderate and high incomes.20
It is well documented that blood pressure and
mortality from hypertensive disease are higher in
blacks than in whites.21,22 The reasons for these
racial differences remain to be determined. Differ-
ences in food consumption patterns (higher sodium,
lower potassium and calcium intake), higher preva-
lence of obesity, lower socio-economic status
(resulting for example in less access to antihyperten-
sive treatment) may contribute to the higher blood
pressure in blacks.23,24 Genetic differences also may
be the cause of a higher inborn susceptibility to
hypertension in blacks. Candidate susceptibility
genes remain the source of speculation, but differ-
ences in sodium sensitivity, cation transport, vascu-
lar injury, insulin resistance or adrenergic activity
have been postulated as being important.23,25 In the
present analysis, blood pressure was corrected for
body-mass index, dietary calcium, dietary sodium,
dietary potassium, poverty index and the use of anti-
hypertensive drugs, but the relation between blood
pressure and blood lead remained significant in
blacks. Though blood lead levels were lower in
whites, the overlap in blood lead levels between
blacks and whites was large, so that it seems
unlikely that there is a threshold value for an effect
of lead on blood pressure that was exceeded in
blacks but not in whites. Most likely, there is still
unidentified confounding in blacks that is not taken
into account in our calculations.
In conclusion, there is no consistent relationship
between blood pressure and blood lead in
NHANES III.
