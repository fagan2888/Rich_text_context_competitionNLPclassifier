Introduction
The fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics (STEM) represent areas of economic growth and
prosperity for the United States. However, STEM fields also
indicate the social ills that remain in U.S. society. Racial,
ethnic, and gender disparities in STEM education and degree
attainment have been documented for nearly 40 years and are
not likely to disappear in the near future (George, Neale, Van
Horne, & Malcom, 2001; National Academy of Sciences,
2010). According to data from the National Science
Foundation (NSF; 2013; 2002-2012), underrepresented
minorities (URMs), although representing 32% of the U.S.
population, comprise only small percentages of bachelor's
degrees earned in science and engineering fields (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2015). Specifically, Hispanics (all races)
comprise 9%, Blacks/African Americans 9%, and American
Indian/Native Americans less than 1%. With regard to doc-
toral degrees, only 11% are earned by URM and if behav-
ioral and social sciences are ignored, this drops to a striking
9%. This disparity in degree attainment directly translates to
a non-diverse STEM workforce of nearly five million, with
one study reporting that URM represent less than 9% of the
workforce and account for less than 8% of the doctorate-
requiring positions in STEM universities and 4-year institu-
tions (Poirier, Tanebaum, Storey, Kirshstein, & Rodriguez,
2009). NSF (2013) data from 2010 show that URM comprise
about 13% of the STEM workforce at the bachelor's degree
and higher, while less than 6% hold full professorships across
all U.S. universities.
To address this education and workforce gap, many pro-
grams have been established to enhance recruitment and
retention of URM in STEM, with agencies such as the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), the NSF, and other
government agencies serving as large benefactors. These

Abstract
The paucity of underrepresented minorities (URMs) earning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
degrees remains an issue in revitalizing the U.S. biomedical workforce. Due to reductions in federal funding, maintaining the
integrity of programs that focus on URM retention and recruitment is crucial. We present data on the mechanisms used
to recruit URM students to our program (e.g., email, events, referrals, website), which individually were equally effective
in attracting applicants to the program. Recruitment mechanisms were grouped and further classified relative to their cost
to implement as lower and higher cost. Our results indicate that lower cost mechanisms, statistically, were as effective as
higher cost mechanisms in recruiting students who persisted to PhD programs. Using a binary logistic regression model to
predict PhD matriculation, higher cost mechanisms were not significant predictors of PhD matriculation. Collectively, these
data demonstrate for the first time that lower cost mechanisms can be as successful in recruiting URM students to summer
programs who pursue PhDs in STEM fields.

programs vary, from summer and academic year research
experiences to innovative STEM curriculum in the class-
room (Chaplin, Manske, & Cuise, 1998; Mervis, 2010;
National Research Council [NRC], 2005; Schultz et al.,
2011). They have demonstrated that research participation is
a key element to career intentions and decisions and that
improvement in curriculum aids in retention of STEM
majors. Whether solely dedicated to URM or a commitment
to URM, the focus of such programs is improvement in
diversity in STEM.
In order for the United States to maintain its competitive
economy and world standing in technology and innovation,
the federal government and others have been implored to tar-
get URM as an "untapped" resource (George et al., 2001;
National Academy of Sciences, 2007; Palmer, Maramba, &
Dancy, 2011; Rodriguez et al., 2012) However, perturbations
in federal funding in recent years have affected these diver-
sity efforts that have been ongoing for several decades. The
effects of sequestration reduced the budgets of NSF and the
NIH by 5%, and have just rebounded, with NIH receiving its
highest increase in 12 years in the new Bipartisan BudgetAct
of 2015 ("Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015," 2015; "President
Obama Inks Budget," 2015; Wadman, 2013). In spite of this
increase, funding for diversity research programs represents
a mere fraction of the budgets for NIH and NSF. Institutional
and individual training grants, research centers at minority
institutions, and minority biomedical research support,
which are the likely NIH funding mechanism for diversity
research programs, collectively represent 3% of the 2016
NIH budget, which includes programs not directed to diver-
sity (NIH Office of Budget, 2015). For NSF, the education
programs represent 12% of the 2016 budget, but again these
activities are not solely focused on diversity (NSF, 2015).
This paucity of funding presents a challenge to staff and pro-
gram directors of diversity research programs. One area of
specific challenge is student recruitment. Federally funded
programs (e.g., NIH Education Projects [R25s]) provide lim-
ited resources for student recruitment and in some cases are
not allowed, resulting in the need for program directors to
find other resources for recruitment (e.g., university sup-
port). For programs where recruitment strategies are vital,
such as summer research experiences, developing and utiliz-
ing efficient recruitment strategies may be necessary to sus-
tain the quality and impact of these programs.
Literature Review
Research opportunities for undergraduates, including sum-
mer research programs, have shown positive effects on
retaining students in STEM (Barlow & Villarejo, 2004;
Pender, Marcotte, Sto Domingo, & Maton, 2010; Slovacek,
Whittinghill, Flenoury, & Wiseman, 2012). The benefits of
undergraduate research to all students are well known and
include higher interest in science, developing identity as a sci-
entist, improved self-confidence, research and professional
skill development, confirmation of career path, and learning
gains in the research process, lab techniques, and scientific
problem solving (Junge, Quinones, Kakietek, Teodarescu, &
Marsteller, 2010; Kardash, 2000; Lopatto, 2004; Seymour,
Hunter, Laursen, & Deantoni, 2004). Programs directed to
URM have shown a great impact on career trajectories, col-
lege persistence, undergraduate grade point average (GPA),
and earning a biology degree (Matsui, Liu, & Kane, 2003;
Nagda, Gregerman, Jonides, von Hippel, & Lerner, 1998;
Villarejo, Barlow, Kogan, Veazey, & Sweeney, 2008). Other
programs, including the well-known Meyerhoff Scholars
Program, have been shown to add to the scientific workforce
by producing URM who persist to PhDs in STEM (Maton,
Sto Domingo, Stolle-McAllister, Zimmerman, & Hrabowski,
2009). One common strand for these studies is evaluation and
a rigorous analysis of the effect of the programs on the afore-
mentioned outcomes, representing a cadre of literature that
further validates the necessity of undergraduate research.
Furthermore, these studies are a mixture of summer and aca-
demic programs for which some extensive recruitment mech-
anisms may not have been necessary. While recruitment is
mentioned in some of these studies, limited data are presented
regarding how students were recruited to these programs.
Investigations on the correlation of recruitment methods to
participant outcomes are lacking in the literature.
Recruitment is a key component for summer research pro-
grams, especially for programs directed to target popula-
tions, where access to such populations may be limited
locally. When the focus is narrowed to summer programs,
there are few data reported on recruitment mechanisms. Data
from the "Spend a Summer With a Scientist" program,
directed to minority students, showed that 62% of the sum-
mer students who were surveyed entered graduate school,
but there was no mention of how students were recruited
(Alexander, Foertsch, & Daffinrud, 1998; Alexander,
Foertsch, Daffinrud, & Tapia, 2000). Similarly, an evaluation
of the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)
program at Emory University reports successful outcomes
such as increased GPA and number of science courses taken
postparticipation, but the only data related to recruitment
showed that over 20% of students were from liberal arts
colleges and that 75% of non-Emory students were from
out of state (Junge et al., 2010). In a study of the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) program sponsored
by the NSF, principal investigators across 106 REU sites
were asked to report measures of success of the participants,
which included graduate school attendance, participant co-
authorship, and participant satisfaction (Beninson, Koski,
Villa, Faram, & O'Connor, 2011). The mechanisms used to
recruit were Internet (email, website), mailings, media, con-
ferences, campus recruitment office, and other methods, with
the majority of participants recruited by Internet or confer-
ences. Although graduate school attendance was a marker of
success, the study did not indicate the number or percentage
of students in graduate school, thus any link of outcome to
Shadding et al. 3
recruitment mechanism could not be assessed. An evaluation
report of the programs funded by the Biological Sciences
Directorate of NSF (BIO REUs) indicates gains by partici-
pants in research skills and thinking like a scientist, with over
50% intending to pursue a PhD in a STEM field. The recruit-
ment mechanisms utilized were announcements, the NSF
website, academic advisors, and web searches. An updated
report from this group discussed the types of institutions of
participants: over 70% from Research I and over 84% from
public universities, but neither institution type nor mecha-
nism type was linked to outcomes or other variables ana-
lyzed in the report (Weston, 2012, 2013). An earlier
evaluation of a summer research program targeted at URM
across 15 R1 institutions within a Midwest consortium
showed that 75% of participants went on to graduate or pro-
fessional school, where these students were a mixture of
majors (e.g., humanities, engineering, natural, and physical
sciences; Foertsch, Alexander, & Penberthy, 1997). Students
were recruited to the program from "on campus" or "off
campus" of the host institution. The "off campus" mecha-
nisms included partnerships with minority-serving institu-
tions (MSIs), which represented 9% of the participants.
Their data showed that participants who were STEM majors
were more likely to attend graduate school and to be
recruited from "off campus"­research extensive schools. No
further classifications of recruitment methods were men-
tioned in the report.
From these studies, it is evident that resources have been
devoted to increasing the pool of URM who will diversify
the STEM workforce. However, little has been reported in
the literature on how students were recruited. Missing in the
literature is a practical focus on recruitment of URM stu-
dents, especially to summer programs. To our knowledge,
the literature to date has not demonstrated the success of
recruitment in attracting students who eventually enroll in
PhD programs and other STEM-related degree programs.
As federal agencies provide limited funds for recruitment
to diversity research programs, it is imperative for pro-
grams to enhance cost-effectiveness to continue the strides
made in diversity.
Using data from our summer program targeted at URM,
Opportunities in Genomics Research (OGR): Undergraduate
Scholars, we show the outcomes of the participants and the
recruitment mechanisms used to attract students to the pro-
gram. We demonstrate empirically, we believe for the first
time, the effectiveness of low-cost strategies in attracting
students who are on the path to high impact terminal degrees
in STEM, namely, STEM doctorates, to a summer program.
Method
Research Questions
Research Question 1: Are low-cost recruitment strategies
effective in recruiting students to the OGR program?
Research Question 2:Are low-cost strategies effective in
recruiting students who persist to PhDs in STEM?
Program Design and Components
The OGR Program was established in 2007 atThe McDonnell
Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis. This
program is a part of the Diversity Action Plan (DAP), an ini-
tiative by the National Human Genome Research Institute
(NHGRI), to increase diversity in the field of genomics and
related fields. The goal of the DAP programs is to increase
the number of PhDs in the field from underrepresented back-
grounds. The DAP programs initially defined URMs as
African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific
Islander. Since 2011, it has expanded the definition to include
first-generation college attendees, socioeconomically/cultur-
ally disadvantaged, and persons with learning and physical
disabilities.
Here we report on the summer research program of OGR:
Undergraduate Scholars. Undergraduate Scholars is an
8-week summer program where students conduct research
with Washington University faculty whose research focus is
concentrated on or related to genetics or genomics. The pro-
gram consists of activities to encourage careers in research
and to help prepare students for graduate school and its
application process. Such activities include graduate school
preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) prepara-
tion, seminars, journal clubs, scientific presentation skills,
and career planning. The foci of this article are the recruit-
ment mechanisms and potential links to outcomes, rather
than the program features.
Participants
We report on 185 applicants to the OGR program from
2007 to 2013. Participants were selected to OGR based on
their application and phone interviews conducted by pro-
gram staff. Factors influencing acceptance into OGR
included recommendations by the mentors, GPA (overall
and STEM), undergraduate major, research interests and
experience (for upperclassmen), interest in a PhD or
research career as indicated in a personal statement and
interview, and classification at time of application. Eligible
students were freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or first
semester seniors (students scheduled to graduate the winter
following the summer program).
We note we did not use a hard-line GPA in our selection
process although great consideration was given to GPAs
3.3 and above. Using the NSF definition of STEM (sci-
ence and engineering), 100% of participants (n = 59) were
STEM majors upon entry to OGR, including two behav-
ioral science majors. Of the program alumni (n = 55),
from 2007 to 2013, 98% obtained a bachelor's degree in
STEM.

Data Collection
The baseline data were extracted from applications to the
program and internally stored in Microsoft Excel. OGR stu-
dents'long-term career outcomes, including career path data,
were collected from participants and stored in iBioSketch.
com, an Internet-based career tracking tool designed by
Strategic Evaluations, Inc., our external evaluation team.
These career outcomes were verified through at least two
other sources, including (a) study leaders' follow-up com-
munication with alumni and their research mentors and (b)
queries submitted to the National Students Clearinghouse.
Matriculants were asked to initiate and update their profiles
in iBiosketch annually, while formal surveys were given
annually to biannually. We supplemented this information
with informal tracking methods (phone calls, social media,
emails, etc.). The reported outcome data indicate where stu-
dents were in their career to our knowledge as of September
2014 or the last reporting of the student (e.g., PhD program,
working in STEM field, etc.)
All data are reported in aggregate. Demographic informa-
tion such as gender, race, and ethnicity were voluntary and
self-reported on the OGR application. Required information
included name of institutions, overall, and STEM GPA (veri-
fied by transcript). Institutions were classified as an MSI
based on data from the Department of Education listings of
minority institutions and Excelencia in Education (2014,
Edexcelencia.org). The following categories for MSIs were
used: Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),
Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and other MSIs (Tribal
Colleges and Universities, Primarily Black Institutions,
Native American­Serving Non-Tribal Institutions, Asian
American, and Native American Pacific Islander­Serving
Institutions), or non-MSIs (majority institutions or primarily
White institutions). Institutions were further categorized
using basic Carnegie Classification (Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching, 2012) and condensed into
the following major categories: associates (includes private
and public), bachelor's (includes baccalaureate arts and sci-
ence, diverse, and baccalaureate/associates), master's (small,
medium, and large), doctoral (doctoral/research universi-
ties), and research (research university with high or very
high activity).
Recruitment Mechanisms
The main goal of this study was to investigate a link between
recruitment methods and student outcomes, particularly
low-cost recruitment methods. We have actively recruited
for the OGR program and documented the mechanism of
student recruitment. We provided several closed-ended
options for applicants to indicate on the OGR application,
"how they heard about the program," which included
instructor, program, email, conference, career fair, brochure/
flyer, website, word of mouth, former OGR student, and
other; applicants were asked to indicate details (e.g., confer-
ence name). These options were condensed into five main
mechanisms: emails, referrals, events, websites, and other.
A brief description of each method is found in Table 1. A
recruitment database was maintained and included all indi-
viduals and institutions we contacted through emails, events,
and mailings. A mechanism was indicated for an applicant
as the likely initial mode of contact. For example, if a stu-
dent listed instructor on his or her application, and it was
noted in our recruitment database that several emails were
sent to that applicant's institution, then email was listed as
the recruitment mechanism. If an applicant's choice of
recruitment mechanism could not be verified in our records,
the strategy was listed as indicated by the applicant or, if no
strategy could be verified, the mechanism was designated as
"other" (see Table 1). The responses for each mechanism
were tallied and the mechanisms assessed against demo-
graphics, GPA, institution types, and outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 was used to compute
descriptive statistics, as well as test for correlations and sta-
tistical significance. Independent-samples chi-square tests
were used to test the distributions for categorical response
variables, including differences between demographic vari-
ables, recruitment mechanisms, and career outcomes. When
appropriate, the crosstab function within SPSS was used to
help determine whether column proportions were signifi-
cantly different. In these cases, z values were computed and
p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
Bonferroni method. To determine whether the means for
our scale variables (overall GPAs and STEM GPAs) were
equal across our independent categories, one-way ANOVAs
were conducted. Matriculation status and recruitment
mechanism were the independent variables, while GPA and
STEM GPA were the dependent variables. Finally, vari-
ables in the data set were examined using a logistic regres-
sion to determine which most likely explained students'
career outcomes. The eligible variables for consideration in
the model were GPA, ethnicity, race, NSF quartile of fund-
ing, NIH quartile of funding, MSI classification, Carnegie
classification, cost of recruitment mechanism, level of per-
sonal contact, and type of recruitment mechanism. Using
this technique, five explanatory/predictor variables and one
response variable (career outcome) were chosen for the
logistic regression model. The dependent variable was
defined as the degree pursuit of the former scholars of the
program coded with dummy value: 1 = scholars who chose
to pursue a PhD or 0 = scholars who did not pursue a PhD.
Predictor variables used were coded as gender (1 = female,
0 = male), ethnicity (1 = Hispanic, 0 = non-Hispanic),
Carnegie classification (1 = high or very high research
activity, 0 = non-research classified institutions), recruit-
ment mechanism (1 = high-cost events and website,
Shadding et al. 5
0 = low-cost email and referrals). The median and mean
GPA were calculated to both be 3.5. Therefore, scholars
with GPAs of 3.5 or higher were coded as 1, while those
with GPAs lower than 3.5 were coded as 0. The logistic
regression model had a Nagelkerke R2 value of .291, sug-
gesting that nearly 30% of the variability in what predicted
students pursuing PhDs was accounted for in this model.
Results
OGR Demographics
The OGR programs are directed to increasing the number
of underrepresented students who pursue PhDs in genomics
and related fields. Over the 7-year reporting period, this
study demonstrates that the program expanded its reach to
help accomplish this goal. In the first three tables, non-
matriculant applicants (n = 126) are compared with matric-
ulant applicants (n = 59), where a matriculant is defined as
an applicant who was accepted and participated in the
program.
Males and females were recruited to the program at rates
that were not significantly different (2 = 2.31, df = 1, p = .128).
However, the number and percentage of females in both the
non-matriculant (66%; n = 83) and matriculant pools (54%;
n = 32) trended higher than that of males. The percentage of
females was nearly double that of males in the non-matricu-
lant pool but was only 8% higher in the matriculant pool
(Table 2). This may be reflective of gains made by women in
undergraduate and graduate programs in certain sectors of
STEM, namely, biological sciences, where females earn 60%
of bachelor's and 56% of doctorates in this area but 51% of
bachelor's and 46% of doctorates in STEM overall (Burrelli,
2008; NSF, 2013). These data may be indicative of another
trend where minority males lag behind their female counter-
parts in certain areas of STEM, where Black and Hispanic
men earn 36% and 44% of STEM bachelor's and 40% and
46% of STEM doctorates, respectively (Aud, Fox, &
KewalRamani, 2010; Harper, 2012; NSF, 2013) A more rig-
orous analysis would be needed to make this determination.
In light of this potential disparity, our recruiting reflects an
effort to increase male matriculants. In 2007, we only had
one male student in our program, constituting 13% of pro-
gram participants in that year. Over time, males represented
a higher percentage of the matriculants, peaking at 75% in
2009 (data not shown).
On the OGR applications, information on ethnicity and
race was requested. Using the census classification for eth-
nicity and race, the number and percentage of Hispanics and
non-Hispanics (all races) and the number and percentage of
racial groups (including Hispanic ethnicity) are reported
(Table 2). Using federal classifications, persons choose an
ethnicity and a race; thus, a person who self-identifies as
Hispanic (ethnicity) may also identify as Caucasian (race).
Comparing non-matriculants and matriculants, Hispanics
were selected at a higher rate than non-Hispanics for matric-
ulation in the program. Forty-four percent of the matriculants
identified as Hispanic; however, they only constituted 31%
of the applicant pool (58 out of 185 applicants; 2 = 5.47, df
= 1, p = .019). Blacks/African Americans constituted 41% of
non-matriculants and 49% of matriculants. As Hispanics are
included in the race category as well, they are reflected in
some of the racial groups. However, the majority of Hispanic
applicants chose "no response" to race on the application, n
= 44. Caucasians represented a small portion of the applicant
pool at 16%, where 21 of 27 applicants and two of three
matriculants identifying as Caucasian were non-Hispanic
Whites (2 = 13.802, df = 5, p = .017). Six applicants chose

Mechanism Description
Emails Recruitment emails and electronic flyers with program information were sent to chairs of STEM departments at
MSIs, institutions ranked by periodicals as top producers of URM graduates in STEM (e.g., Diverse issues of Higher
education, Hispanic outlook, Winds of Change), and program directors of MARC-USTAR, MBRS-RISE, and LSAMP
Referrals Word of mouth by colleagues of program staff, other faculty, and OGR students; shared applications from other DAP
programs and other on-campus summer programs
Events Program staff attended large URM student focused conferences (e.g., ABRCMS, SACNAS) and smaller internship and
campus career fairs at MSIs and visited individual classes and program meetings at MSIs and non-MSIs.
Websites Includes the OGR webpage and other websites across the country. The URL for the OGR website was included on all
OGR media (flyers, ink pens, emails, etc.); the URL was posted on the career/internship/program websites at various
institutions and appeared on national webpages (e.g., Institute for Broadening Participation and NHGRI)
Other Ads and fliers were generated and mailed to institutions (all types) within the Missouri/Illinois area and to some MSIs
that border these states. This also includes when no indication was given how a student heard about the program or
if we could not verify against our database the method listed by an applicant

Selectivity
The OGR Undergraduate Scholars program has remained
very small, with eight to 12 participants per year. Initially,
recruitment efforts were limited but have diversified over the
years of the program. Since its inception, the number of
applicants to the program increased over 300% at its peak in
2011, with an overall acceptance rate of 33% from 2007 to
2013 (59/185). While the total number of applicants declined
from 2012 to 2013, the acceptance rate was maintained close
to 25% due to fewer available slots. The OGR program par-
ticipants included previous students in good standing who
re-entered the program non-competitively (Figure 1), how-
ever, these students are only counted once in the total number
of applications, so each year reflects unique applicants only
(solid line--Figure 1).
To better assess demographics and the selectivity of OGR,
institutional data were extracted from the applications.
Institutions were classified as MSI using data from the U.S.
Department of Education minority institutions programs and
Excelencia in Education. The major classifications utilized
for MSIs were HBCU, HSI, other MSI, or non-MSI (Table
3). For non-matriculants, 50% had attended an MSI, and 26%
had attended an HBCU. Among matriculants, over 60%
attended an MSI where HBCUs and HSIs were nearly equal
at 31% and 32%, respectively; these differences were not sig-
nificant. In addition, Carnegie classifications for matriculants
and non-matriculants were compared and condensed into
the following categories: associates, baccalaureate, master's,

doctoral, and research. Research universities provided the
largest number of applicants, both matriculants (44%) and
non-matriculants (39%; Table 3). Baccalaureate and master's
institutions supplied the next largest group of non-matricu-
lants (25% and 28%) and matriculants (27% and 17%),
respectively. Overall, there was no difference in matriculants
compared with non-matriculants when considering Carnegie
classification. Regional data for the institutions using U.S.
regions as classified by U.S. Census Bureau were collected.
The largest percentage of schools for both matriculants (53%)
and non-matriculants (38%) were located in the South, which
corresponds to the location of a considerable number of
MSIs (data not shown)
Shadding et al. 7
The selectivity of the program is further demonstrated by
the GPA data. To determine whether there was a difference in
GPA within different phases of the application process, we
analyzed GPAs of all applicants, those invited to interview,
offers made, and matriculants. We found no significant dif-
ference in overall or STEM GPA among applicants within
the different phases (data not shown). Therefore, GPA vari-
ables were not distinguishing factors between students at dif-
ferent phases of the application process.
Recruitment Mechanisms
Suggested best practices to recruit and retain URM in STEM
include strategies such as improving K-12 education, part-
nerships with MSIs and secondary schools, establishing
mentorship programs, discipline-specific short courses, and
so on (NHGRI, 2006; Organization for Tropical Studies,
2007). Little attention has been paid to the practical aspect of
recruitment, which may become more important for feder-
ally funded programs given the decreases recently experi-
enced in funding.
Table 4 shows recruitment mechanisms for non-matricu-
lants and matriculants to the OGR program from 2007 to
2013. For both groups, the largest percentage of students was
recruited via email and referrals; the number recruited from
emails trended slightly higher for non-matriculants and refer-
rals for matriculants. Collectively, the two strategies of refer-
rals and emails accounted for nearly 70% of students who
ultimately were selected for the program. However, when
tested statistically, all recruitment strategies proved to be
equally effective in drawing students to the program. The
lack of significant difference also indicates that no specific
mechanism was favored in the selection of students. These
data provide some confidence that the methods were varied
and provide a platform to effectively compare them for
outcomes.
In this study, with the exception of ethnicity and race,
there was no significant difference in non-matriculants ver-
sus matriculants in other demographics, institution classifi-
cation, GPA, and recruitment mechanism. Next, data were

analyzed to determine whether there was a difference in
these variables when measured against the recruitment
mechanism.
Table 5 shows the recruitment mechanism of all appli-
cants by gender, ethnicity, and race. Crosstabs of demo-
graphic variables and recruitment mechanisms show that
there were notable gender differences. Males were more
likely to apply to the OGR program as a result of a referral
(44%) or through website advertisement (16%). Conversely,
females were more likely to apply to the OGR program as a
result of email solicitations (40%) or by hearing about the
OGR program at an event (30%). Therefore, there may be
gender differences in how applicants were attracted to the
program.
While there was no significant difference across any of
the mechanisms when comparing ethnicity, the effectiveness
of recruitment mechanisms varied significantly for the dif-
ferent racial groups. Applicants identifying as Black/African
American were most likely drawn to OGR by interacting
with our program at an event (31%). Website advertisements
were the most effective mechanisms for attracting applicants
identifying as Asian, where 33% applied through this mecha-
nism, more than any other racial group. Email solicitations
attracted a significantly high proportion of applications from
students identifying as Caucasian (50%).
Our recruitment mechanisms, emails, events, referrals,
website, and other, experienced varying levels of success
dependent upon the type of institution (Table 6). Students
attending institutions classified as HBCUs were more likely
drawn to the program through interacting with OGR project
leaders at an event (41%), but website advertisement was

most effective in drawing applicants from non-MSI institu-
tions (15%). The recruitment mechanisms were equally as
effective across the different Carnegie classifications
although emails or referrals were the mechanisms that
attracted the largest percentage of applicants from each insti-
tution type.
We also tested whether any mechanism was responsible
for attracting applicants with more selective overall or STEM
GPAs. While the overall and STEM GPA for applicants
recruited through the website mechanism trended higher
than the GPA data for applicants recruited through other
mechanisms, there was no statistical difference indicating
that no given strategy was more effective in attracting a stu-
dent with a high GPA (data not shown).
Outcomes
The recruitment mechanisms utilized in this study are rela-
tively common and accessible for similar programs. The goal
of this study was to demonstrate, for the first time, the effec-
tiveness of these methods in recruiting students who prog-
ress to desired program outcomes.
Table 7 lists the outcomes of the students in the OGR pro-
gram from 2007 to 2013. Only students who completed their
baccalaureate degree are included in the table (55 students).
Program outcome data reveal that 27% of students entered
PhD programs (includes MD/PhD, n = 1) while 16% transi-
tioned to professional degree programs in STEM areas (MD,
DDS, and PharmD). An additional 11% enrolled in a post-
baccalaureate training or master's degree programs follow-
ing their undergraduate studies. Collectively, 54% of students
across the 7 years transitioned to advanced training in STEM
fields. It is important to note that the "outcomes" used in this
analysis were accurate as of September 2014; students may
have progressed to a higher level of training since this report.
These data are a snapshot of where students were at the time
our team analyzed the data for the article and does not cap-
ture each career step made by the participant since complet-
ing OGR.
An analysis of demographic variables in relation to career
outcomes shows that there were no statistical differences for
the gender variable. Fifty-three percent of the students
enrolled in PhD programs were male, while 67% of students
enrolled in STEM professional degree programs were female
(Table 8).
Hispanics showed a strong trend in transitioning to PhD
programs (67%) versus just 33% of non-Hispanics. However,
the difference was not significant (2 = 5.031, df = 3, p =
.170). No statistical differences were seen among career out-
comes and race. While Black/African American students
accounted for more than 50% of students transitioning to
STEM professional degree programs and postbaccalaureate/
master's programs, these students accounted for only 26% of
those transitioning to PhD programs.
Students who attended institutions categorized by
Carnegie as research high/very high were more likely to
enroll in a PhD program than to pursue other career paths
(Table 9). Seventy-three percent of students who enrolled in
PhD programs were trained at these institutions, a higher
percentage than any other Carnegie classification. There
were no additional differences found by analyzing Carnegie
type versus career outcomes.
It is interesting to note that 40% of students trained at
HSIs went on to pursue a PhD, outpacing their HBCU coun-
terparts nearly threefold. However, the difference in PhD
enrollment rates between HSIs and HBCUs were not signifi-
cantly different (2 = 3.760, df = 6, p = .709).
When comparing outcomes versus the mechanism of
recruitment, the majority of students who transitioned to
PhD programs were recruited by events (40%), while the
majority of students who transitioned to STEM professional
degree programs were recruited by referrals (55.6%; Table
10). However, there were no statistically significant differ-
ences in the individual recruitment mechanisms that drew
students to the program and their ultimate career outcomes,

suggesting that no single mechanism was statistically more
likely to yield students enrolling in advanced degree pro-
grams, F(4, 50) = .858, p = .496. Using 2 as the measure of
effect size, recruitment mechanism only accounted for 6% of
the total variability in the career outcomes.
This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of low-
cost recruitment strategies in attracting students who later
enroll in PhD programs. To further explore these mecha-
nisms and their outcomes, strategies were grouped by rela-
tive cost: lower cost and higher cost. Figure 2 shows a
relative cost spectrum of the recruitment mechanisms we
used. Emails and referrals were of little cost in dollars to the
OGR program to execute as a mechanism; thus, we com-
bined these to form the lower cost category. However, web-
sites and events are higher cost strategies. Website here
includes our website as well as other websites across the
country where we advertised (e.g., schools, government).
Although we advertised for free on external sites, generally
speaking websites can be costly to create and to maintain,
where a basic site can be free or cost several thousand dollars
and more elaborate sites can be as high as tens of thousands
(Katkin, 2015). Events can be costly for small programs,
whereas for our program, they have been primarily confer-
ences, ranging in cost from US$1,500 to US$3,000 or more
per conference. In Figure 2, we used the two-directional
arrow for events and websites to indicate that one may cost
more than the other, but both are more costly than emails or
referrals for our program.
Lower cost mechanisms were highly effective in attract-
ing students who eventually matriculated into terminal
degree programs. Over 50% of OGR alumni who pursued
PhD programs were recruited by lower cost mechanisms
compared with 40% of PhD pursuants recruited by higher
cost mechanisms. All of the students in our program who
pursued STEM professional degrees were recruited by lower
cost mechanisms (Figure 2). Thus, in our small sample,
lower cost mechanisms are statistically as effective as higher
cost mechanisms in recruiting students who transition to
PhD, F(1, 53) = 1.172, p = .284. Using 2 as the measure of
effect size, cost of recruitment only accounted for 2% of the
total variability among those pursuing PhDs.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study shows for the first time the
cost-effectiveness of recruitment strategies in attracting
URM participants to a diversity research summer program
who progress to desired outcomes. Few studies have men-
tioned recruitment mechanisms for summer programs, and
only one has indicated the outcome of students who were
recruited by certain mechanisms (on- vs. off-campus;
Foertsch et al., 1997). Overall, the literature contains little
that shows the results of students who were recruited by spe-
cific strategies. The findings of this study provide a tool for
leaders of diversity research programs to evaluate their cur-
rent recruitment methods and to incorporate new ones. While
we do not owe the outcomes of the participants to these
recruitment mechanisms, we do believe this study indicates
to program directors that lower cost strategies can be utilized
effectively to attract students who are on the path to graduate
and professional degrees.
OGR, like other diversity research programs, is devoted
to the success of URM in STEM, where students build their
skills and are provided with the opportunity to gain research
experience and prepare for graduate studies. This study dem-
onstrates a selective, competitive, gender-balanced, URM-
centered program, where students were recruited from
diverse institutions using a host of mechanisms. The recruit-
ment mechanisms that are the focus of this article are quite
common and available for all programs. We have demon-
strated how these mechanisms can be assessed to trace their
effectiveness to participant outcomes. The five mechanisms
Shadding et al. 11
of recruitment, email, referrals, event, websites, and other,
were not statistically different among non-matriculants and
matriculants as single mechanisms. However, a number of
statistical differences were evident when we compared the
mechanisms and the demographics of the applicants. We
note a gender difference in how males and females were
recruited to apply to the OGR program. For females, email
and events were the most effective and for males, referrals
and websites were most effective. As demonstrated in
Table 5, each gender was drawn to the program by one low-
cost and one high-cost mechanism. These mechanisms can
be further classified as high contact (e.g., referrals, events)
and low contact (e.g., email, website), which indicates the
level of personalization the mechanisms required. For
instance, referrals and events required in-person contact or
some prior relationships established by the program staff
with individual applicants or faculty/administrators at a par-
ticular institution, whereas email and websites did not require
this personalization or level of contact. Similarly, males and
females were attracted to the program by one low-contact
and one high-contact mechanism; whereas the high-contact
mechanism was most important for males, a low-contact
mechanism attracted the most females. It would be tempting
to speculate that because of the data noted earlier regarding
the low number of minority males compared with their
female counterparts, using a high-contact mechanism such as
referral may indicate that some advocacy may have played a
role on behalf of the referee. More data are needed to make
inferences about why this gender difference exists, but it can
be assumed that a diverse set of methods is essential to ensure
gender balance in the program.
When comparing race for specific mechanisms, differ-
ences were noted. Email was most effective for Caucasians,
website for Asians, and events for Blacks. These strategies
are a mix of high and low cost, but high contact was signifi-
cant for a portion of the target URM groups, corresponding
with data showing events were significant for recruiting stu-
dents who attended HBCUs. This may verify what is assumed
anecdotally when recruiting URM, namely, Blacks/African
Americans in this case, that recruiters must search and go
where these students are to diversify their programs. This
may certainly be true for Black females, who have been
noted to select graduate schools based on relationships and
environments that appear to be more supportive (Upton &
Tanenbaum, 2014).
Outcome data indicate that overall the OGR program was
successful: Over 50% of alumni were involved in advanced
training in STEM, including 27% enrolled in PhD or MD/
PhD programs. In light of this, our data do highlight some
interesting points regarding race and ethnicity. Although the
percentage of Hispanics and non-Hispanics only differed by
10% in our matriculant pool favoring non-Hispanics, the per-
centage of Hispanics who matriculated to the PhD was twice
that of non-Hispanics (67% vs. 33%). The largest group of

non-Hispanics was Blacks, who earned slightly more than
half of STEM professional degrees. This would suggest that
ethnicity and race even within URM might play a role in
matriculation to terminal degrees in STEM. Nationally, both
groups are underrepresented in the health professions (e.g.,
medicine and dentistry), and according to the American
Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC; 2014) and the
American Dental Association, Blacks and Hispanics make
up 9% and 8%, respectively, of working physicians and den-
tists (Wyckoff, 2010). This is similar to the number reported
by Poirier et al. (2009) for STEM PhDs. Additional data
indicate that, nationally, Hispanic college enrollment has
increased and now outnumbers the enrollment of Blacks in
baccalaureate and doctoral degree attainment in STEM.
Therefore, this study may be reflective of this national trend
(Fry & Lopez, 2012; NSF, 2013).
In this study, we asked what variables were important for
underrepresented students in our study to pursue a PhD. We
wanted to determine whether the type of recruitment mecha-
nism and the relative cost played a role along with other vari-
ables. Using a binary logistic regression analysis, the
variables that were strong predictors of students who chose
to enroll in PhD programs following their undergraduate
training were determined. The following five variables
emerged as reliably distinguishing between PhD pursuants
and non-PhD pursuants: Carnegie classification, gender, eth-
nicity, GPA, and relative cost of recruitment mechanism
(test of model coefficients: 2 = 12.322, p = .03 with df = 5;
Table 11). Of these five variables, Carnegie classification
was the variable that proved to be the strongest positive pre-
dictor (p = .028), where students attending research universi-
ties with high or very high research activity were 5 times
more likely to enroll in PhD programs versus those not
enrolled in this type of university. While high-cost recruit-
ment mechanisms (events and website) were positive predic-
tors of students pursuing PhDs, they were not statistically
significant positive predictors (p = .11). Although our data
12 SAGE Open
set is quite small, our model corresponds with national data
indicating that, overall, most PhD recipients hail from bac-
calaureate institutions that are research intensive (Fiegener
& Proudfoot, 2013). The majority of our PhD pursuants in
our sample were Hispanics and, of the HSIs in our data that
produced PhD pursuants, 83% were research universities
with high or very high activity. However, for Black students
from HBCUs who pursued PhDs, their schools were not
classified as research universities and the same for those pur-
suing STEM professional degrees, which may also account
for our model results, where HBCUs regardless of research
intensity have been noted to play a major role in Blacks pur-
suing PhDs (Bonner, Alfred, Lewis, Nave, & Frizell, 2009).
With this correspondence to national data, we believe that a
more robust examination of the relative cost of recruitment
mechanism may provide us with clearer evidence of its con-
tribution to the pursuit of the PhD pathway.
Limitations and Implications for Future Studies
There are several limitations to this study. As indicated
above, one limitation is the sample size and the focus on one
program, which may have prevented statistical significance
in some of our data as well as determining the level of con-
tribution of factors to the PhD path within our model. In
examining our recruitment mechanisms, we disaggregated
data from an already small sample size; thus, our data are
suggestive rather than conclusive, regarding the effective-
ness of our mechanisms. Also, this study lacks outcome data
for non-matriculants, which would provide definition to our
recruitment mechanisms and their association with out-
comes. As our program is ongoing, we continue to collect
these data, which may increase our sample size for future
studies. We can examine other programs with similar foci
controlling for variation in program design to validate our
findings. We believe that our data provide a skeleton for a
larger study to examine recruitment mechanisms in detail for
summer research programs that can also be translated to
other programs (e.g., graduate programs, postbaccalaureate
programs).
These data should not be considered in isolation. We
acknowledge that there are many factors involved in the path
to the PhD for all students and those in our programs. In no
way are we suggesting that our mechanisms are responsible
for students pursuing STEM doctorates or professional
degrees. Factors such as the quality of the research experi-
ences during the OGR program, prior- and post-OGR
research experience, and quality of their application to PhD
programs are just among the few factors responsible for
entry into graduate and professional programs, which we did
not consider here, but may be interesting to add to a more
comprehensive study. In speaking of recruitment only, how-
ever, it might be interesting to note the "dosage" of recruit-
ment and the relationship development to recruit a student
and then look at the outcome. In other words, using the
mechanisms we outlined, does the number of times an indi-
vidual student was contacted prior to matriculation into a
program matter to the outcome? Currently, the number of
times individuals were contacted by our program, from ini-
tial contact to application, is recorded, but the amount of
contact from application to matriculation is not captured, so
the focus of this study was the front-end recruitment.
We know that selection matters to the outcomes we
observed, whether it is self-selection by the student to apply
to our program or selection of matriculants by program
leadership. Our program sought students interested in
research; thus, some students were on track to the PhD
when they entered OGR. However, in our selection of par-
ticipants, GPA, prior research experience, and specific
coursework were not the major determinants of selection.
We certainly accepted students who were conducting
research for the first time or deciding on a career path. A
more in-depth study is needed to determine the true effect
of OGR on the outcomes.
Another limitation may be that we have not put into prac-
tice newer and possibly more innovative methods of recruit-
ment (e.g., social media and virtual recruitment fairs) to
determine if they are effective in bringing students to our
program and in attracting students who pursue terminal
degrees in STEM. While we recently implemented webinars
to provide information on OGR, the email mechanism was
still the initial mode of contact to attract participants to the
webinar.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates for the first time that cost-effective
measures can be utilized to recruit students who will ulti-
mately pursue PhDs or STEM professional degrees. We
provide evidence that establishing a system to implement
lower cost mechanisms may be worth an investment of time
for individual programs, especially during fiscally lean
times. Higher cost mechanisms, namely, conferences, are
recruitment staples and have great value, which according
to our data, part of their value is in recruiting Blacks and
students from HBCUs. But we also show the value of lower
cost mechanisms, and we suggest that this value is that
using these mechanisms does not compromise program out-
comes, while conserving program dollars. We believe that
lower cost recruitment mechanisms can be used to supple-
ment higher cost ones and should be given great consider-
ation in program recruitment plans. We also advocate that
summer programs designed to attract URM students thor-
oughly track the recruitment mechanisms and the outcomes
by the mechanisms because this may be a key to improved
efficiency.
We caution that our data must be viewed as a part of the
overall experience for the student. As a whole, we are not
suggesting that our program is solely responsible for the
outcomes, rather our program was a part of the students'
Shadding et al. 13
experiences and there were many factors that contributed
to the outcomes, those within and outside of the OGR pro-
gram goals. We also want to make clear that by recruiting
students via certain mechanisms we are not guaranteeing a
particular outcome nor are we implying the mechanism is
responsible for the outcome. What we do suggest is that by
assessing mechanisms comprehensively in light of small
recruitment budgets, cost-effective mechanisms may be
utilized, and in our program, these mechanisms were suc-
cessful in attracting URM students who pursued terminal
degrees in STEM.
