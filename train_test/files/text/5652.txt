Article
Over the last decade, education administrators and govern-
ments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia,
and Asia have exerted considerable efforts in recruiting and
retaining qualified teachers (Watt & Richardson, 2007). Our
university in the upper Midwest of the United States recently
joined a national effort to increase the number of math and
science teachers. As recruitment of new teachers is a major
goal of our efforts, we want to develop a recruitment pro-
gram--a strategy for attracting well-qualified students into
teaching--which educates students about the teaching pro-
fession. Most university-based teacher education programs
in the United States have specific selection criteria that guide
which students are admitted to the program, but relatively
few programs have a systematic program for actively recruit-
ing students into their programs (Tenore, Dunn, Laughter, &
Milner, 2010). Instead, program doors are left open and stu-
dents self-select to become a teacher.
An effective recruitment strategy will be responsive to
students' perceptions of teaching as a career option. Almost
all college students have spent most of their scholastic lives
in formal classrooms, and their perceptions of teaching are
shaped by their wealth of classroom-based experience
(Haberman, 1989). The "insider" knowledge students have
of the classroom may pre-dispose them to erroneously dis-
miss teaching as a career opportunity due to a lack of under-
standing the actual work of teachers. Students choose--or
dismiss--a career in teaching with pre-established, strong,
and sometimes misguided perceptions about the work of
teaching based on their prior classroom experiences (Pajares,
1993). Students who have not had positive school-related
experiences may disregard teaching as a career opportunity
(Bianco, Leech, & Mitchell, 2011). Therefore, a strategy to
recruit new teachers should be guided by students' com-
monly held perceptions of teaching as a career option.
Knowing how students generally perceive teaching will pro-
vide an effective starting place in designing a recruitment
strategy that provides students with an accurate understand-
ing of the professional demands of teaching.
The goal of this study is to better understand commonly
held perceptions undergraduates have of teaching to guide
the development of a recruitment strategy that addresses stu-
dents'perceptions, including their concerns, about a possible
career in teaching. We recognize that perceptions of teaching

Analyzing Factors Influencing Teaching
as a Career Choice Using Structural
Equation Modeling
Budhinath Padhy1, Kenneth Emo2, Gemechis Djira3,
and Amit Deokar4
Abstract
The purpose of the study is to analyze factors influencing students' perceptions of teaching as a career choice using structural
equation modeling with the goal of shaping a teacher education recruitment program. In this study, 458 students from a
Midwestern university in the United States responded to an online survey about career-related factors they value, their
expectation that teaching would offer those factors, and any social-influence factors that might encourage them to choose
a teaching career. The effect of 10 exogenous motivation variables (value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-extrinsic,
value-altruistic, expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic, expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-
experience, and social-suggestions) on choosing a teaching career was examined. Results of our analysis showed that the
factors related to expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-experience, and social-
suggestions were found to be significant, whereas value-related factors and expectancy-extrinsic factors were found to be
insignificant.

are subjective, are of cultural origin, and will vary with time
and place. Whereas public perceptions of schooling and
teaching are surveyed regularly (Bushaw & Lopez, 2010,
2011, 2012, 2013), our searches revealed only a few pub-
lished studies that researched the perceptions of teaching
held by university students uncommitted to a teaching career.
These studies found that students favorably disposed to
teaching were inclined to place higher value on altruistic fac-
tors, such as making positive contributions to society, than
those less likely to teach (Kyriacou & Coulthard, 2000) and
that students were more likely to see only the intrinsic
rewards of teaching (See, 2004). To understand student per-
ceptions of teaching as a career option, we administered a
survey to undergraduate university students. We used struc-
tural equation models (SEMs) to investigate the relationship
between what students value in a career and what they expect
teaching to provide (value- and expectancy-related con-
structs), the social experiences that influence their percep-
tions, and the likelihood of choosing a career in teaching.
Theoretical Framework
This study utilizes a survey based on the expectancy-value
theory of motivation (Eccles, 1994, 2009; Eccles et al., 1983;
Jozefowicz, Barber, & Eccles, 1993; Wigfield, 1994;
Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). The expectancy-value theory of
motivation states that individuals are motivated to make
choices in light of their personal values and the expectation
that a particular choice will allow those values to be fulfilled.
One's values and the expectation one has that a given choice
will meet those values are highly personal and are formed
through past experiences, the stereotypes that one holds, and
the way a person self-perceives his or her abilities to perform
well in given situations (Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984).
Good choices are the result of understanding one's personal
values and how the array of options in a given choice will
allow one to meet those values. The theory has been success-
fully applied to understanding choices made in academic
school disciplines and sports, as well as to specific types of
careers (Watt, 2002, 2006). Watt and Richardson (2007) have
contended that expectancy-value motivational model was
particularly useful in investigating motivating factors for
choosing a teaching career. Expectancy-value theorists argue
that individuals' choices, their persistence, and their perfor-
mances can be explained by their expectations of doing well
in an activity and the extent to which they value that activity
(Atkinson, 1957; Eccles, 2005; Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield,
1994; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992).
This study utilized a survey instrument adapted, with per-
mission, from one designed by Kyriacou and Coulthard
(2000). Based on an expectancy-value model of motivation,
the survey asks respondents to first rate the value they placed
on 20 different career-related characteristics and then rate
whether or not they expected a career in teaching to meet
their values. The survey's 20 different career-related
characteristics are items that are perceived as characteristics
generally valued in a career (Brown, 1992; Chuene, Lubben,
& Newson, 1999; Kyriacou & Kobori, 1998; Kyriacou &
Coulthard, 2000) and fit into one of three different
categories:
Intrinsic motivations: These cover aspects of the job
activity itself, such as the activity of teaching children,
and an interest in using their subject matter knowledge
and expertise;
Extrinsic motivations: These relate to aspects of the job
that are not inherent in the work itself, such as long holi-
days, level of pay, and status.
Altruistic motivations: The deal with seeing teaching as a
socially worthwhile and important job, a desire to help
children succeed, and a desire to help society improve.
Based on a combination of exploratory and confirmatory
factor analyses, Wigfield and Eccles (2000) proposed three
higher order constructs for the expectancy-value theory of
motivation: (a) expectancy/ability beliefs, (b) subjective task
value (i.e., attainment, intrinsic, and utility values), and (c)
perceived task difficulty (i.e., effort required and task
difficulty).
Our Present Context and Development of
Conceptual Constructs
Our present study was informed by Kyriacou and Coulthard's
(2000). It involves four different survey sections in which the
respondents were asked to mark factors that they value
highly in their careers, mark factors they expect teaching
would provide, and designate any social-influence factors
that might prompt interest in a career in teaching and their
likelihood of choosing a teaching career. The value and
expectancy sections consist of 20 items each, the social-
influence section consists of 12 items, and finally, 1 item for
the likelihood of choosing a teaching career. Using explor-
atory factor analysis (EFA) techniques, we found a total of
10 underlying constructs to be appropriate for this
application.
The value section (Section A) asks questions on items that
are valued in a general career of their choice. The respon-
dents were guided by the following prompt as they filled out
the value section of the survey: "What factors are important
to you when considering your own future career?" Using
EFA, items such as "A career that I will find enjoyable,"
"Colleagues that I can get along with," and "A pleasant
working environment" were found to be aligned along a con-
struct. As these were something to do with an environment,
we have named the corresponding construct as value-
environment (aEnv). The items "A career that provides intel-
lectual challenge," "A career which gives me responsibility,"
"A career in which I can use the disciplinary knowledge
learned at college," "A job with a reasonable workload," and
Padhy et al. 3
"A job that provides high quality resources and equipment"
relate inherently to the job itself and are considered intrinsi-
cally motivated items that we named as value-intrinsic
(aIntr). Items "A career that provides long-term security," "A
career with good promotional prospects," "High earnings
over the length of career," "A career that's well respected,"
"A career that provides opportunity to travel," "A career that
provides mobility," and "A career with good starting salary"
relate to the aspects of the job that are not inherent in the
work itself, are considered incentive-based or extrinsically
motivated items, and were named value-extrinsic (aExtr).
Finally, the items "Acareer that allows me to contribute posi-
tively to society," "A career that can easily be combined with
parenthood," "The opportunity to work with children and
youth," "A career that gives me the opportunity to care for
others," and "A job that helps other people" relate to a career
where one could help and care for youths, society, and others,
and were considered altruistic and named value-altruistic
(aAltr). A concise description of items and their associated
constructs with short names are given in Table 1.
In the expectancy section (Section B), the students were
asked to rate their expectation that teaching would provide
the same list of factors given in the value section (Section A).
The respondents were prompted by the question, "To what
extent do you think a career in teaching would offer each of
the following factors?" Using the EFA techniques, we found
that items in this section were aligned along three constructs
(instead of four as in the value section). The items "A career
that I will find enjoyable," "Colleagues that I can get along
with," and "A pleasant working environment" were also
found to be aligned with a construct that was related to the
environment and was named expectancy-environment
(bEnv). As a career in teaching inherently deals with helping
children and youth, and positively contributing to the society,
we saw that the items "A career that provides intellectual
challenge," "A career which gives me responsibility," "A
career in which I can use the disciplinary knowledge learned
at college," "A career that's well respected," "A job with a
reasonable workload," "A career that provides mobility," "A
career that allows me to contribute positively to society," "A
career that can easily be combined with parenthood," "The
opportunity to work with children and youth," "A career that
gives me the opportunity to care for others," and "A job that
helps other people" were found to be aligned along a single
construct. These items relate to the teaching job itself, are
intrinsically motivated, and were named expectancy-intrin-
sic (bIntr). The third set of items, "A career that provides
long-term security," "A career with good promotional pros-
pects," "High earnings over the length of career," "A career
that provides high quality resources and equipment," "A
career that provides opportunity to travel," and "A career
with good starting salary," are associated with the aspects of
a job that are not inherent in the work itself and are consid-
ered incentive based or extrinsically motivated items. The
construct along which these items were aligned was named
expectancy-extrinsic (bExtr). A concise description of items
in this section, their associated constructs, and their short
names are given in Table 2.

Finally, the social-influence section (Section D) is guided
by the question, "How might the following factors influence
your decision to become a teacher?" Using the EFA tech-
niques, we identified three constructs that were found to be
prominent. The items "The salaries teachers earn," "The
social status of teachers," "What I know and have heard
about schools," "Dealing with disruptive students," and
"Media report on education" relate to media information on
education and its people. We named this construct
social-media-education (dMedia). The items "Desire to
share knowledge with others," "Previous experiences I've
had teaching others," "The talent I've for working effectively
with others," and "Teachers I've known" relate to prior
teaching experience and desire to share with others effec-
tively. The associated construct was named social-prior-
experience (dPrior). The two items "What friends suggest I
should do" and "What parent suggest I should do" relate to
suggestions from friends and family. We called this construct
social-suggestions (dSugg). A concise description of items in
this section, their associated constructs, and their short names
are given in Table 3.
Definition of the Constructs
Thus, we have a total of 10 exogenous constructs that are
defined as follows:
Value-environment: construct measured by environmental
items that the students value highly in their career of
choice.
Value-intrinsic: construct measured by intrinsically moti-
vated items that the students value highly in their career of
choice.
Value-extrinsic: construct measured by extrinsically moti-
vated items that the students value highly in their career of
choice.
Value-altruistic: construct measured by altruistically
motivated items that the students value highly in their
career of choice.
Expectancy-environment: construct measured by environ-
ment items that the students expect career in teaching will
provide.
Expectancy-intrinsic: construct measured by intrinsically
motivated items that the students expect career in teach-
ing will provide.
Expectancy-extrinsic: construct measured by extrinsically
motivated items that the students expect career in teach-
ing will provide.
Social-media-education: construct measured by media on
education items that students get through social and media
influence.
Social-prior-experience: construct measured by items
related to prior experience of students.

The Research Question
Our present study attempts to answer the following research
question:
Research Question 1: Are the participant's career envi-
ronment; intrinsic, extrinsic, and altruistic motivations
behind the choice of a career including teaching; and
social influence related to the likelihood of choosing a
teaching career?
We used SEM, a multivariate technique, to represent a
model that incorporates the above mentioned relationships
among the 11 variables: likelihood of choosing a career in
teaching, the outcome variable, and the 10 exogenous con-
structs (value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-extrinsic,
value-altruistic, expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrin-
sic, expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-education, social-
prior-experience, and social-suggestions). Whereas multiple
regressions measure only the direct relationship between the
dependent and independent observed variables while con-
trolling other variables, SEM examines simultaneous inter-
action among observed and latent variables under study. The
SEM research model for our study is shown in Figure 1. To
keep the figure simple, covariances among the exogenous
constructs were not shown.
Method
Procedure and Participants
The survey was made available to more than 1,300 students
who were enrolled in 13 undergraduate courses at a medium
sized university at an upper Midwestern state of the United
States. The survey instrument was adapted from a survey
developed by Kyriacou and Coulthard (2000). Course
instructors announced the survey to students and encouraged
them to take part. The survey was administered using an
online survey website and was available for approximately 2
months. There were 458 respondents, with 3 missing data
cases resulting in 455 complete cases. With permission, we
utilized the above survey data for our analysis.
There were 62% male respondents and 38% female
respondents to this survey. The majority of the respondents
were younger undergraduates, with 72% in the 18- to
20-year-old category, 21% in the ages of 21 to 24, and the
remaining 7% were 25 years of age or older. The class ranks
of the respondents were as follows: 48% were freshman,
27% sophomores, 18% juniors, 6% seniors, and 1% graduate
students. Respondents were predominately White or
European American with 91% of total, 1.13% African
American, 1.8% Native American, 1.3% Asian or Pacific
Islander, 0.9% Latino, and 0.68% multiracial. Finally, the
respondents were asked to state their majors they are pursu-
ing. The respondents were 56% from life sciences, 5% from
physical sciences, 6% from mathematics, 8% from engineer-
ing, and 22% had their majors undeclared.
Measures
As mentioned in the introduction, the respondents provided
their response to a multiple-item survey instrument with 20
items in the value section, 20 items in the expectancy sec-
tion, 12 items in social-influence section, and 1 item in the
likelihood of choosing a teaching career section. The value,
expectancy, and social-influence items and their correspond-
ing constructs we developed through EFA were given in
Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For the initial model, we
hypothesize that the constructs measured by their items are
distinct in the sense that each construct has its own set of
items or indicator variables (i.e., unidimensional).
The responses to the value and expectancy sections were
captured by a rating scale with numeric values in the domain

(1 = completely unimportant, 2 = somewhat unimportant, 3 =
somewhat important, and 4 = very important), whereas
responses to the questions for social influence are again ordi-
nal ones and are in the domain (1 = discouraging me from
becoming a teacher, 2= no effect, and 3 = encouraging to
become a teacher). Finally, responses to likelihood of choos-
ing a teaching career section are captured as ordinal values of
1, 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to "very unlikely," "unlikely,"
"somewhat likely," and "very likely," respectively.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics of our data show that the standard-
ized kurtosis index of all 53 variables except the indicator
variable A1 are within the range of ±3.68, whereas standard-
ized kurtosis index ofA1 is 23.56.According to Kline (2011),
the absolute kurtosis values greater than 10 suggest a prob-
lem, and values more than 20 could possess serious problem.
The absolute skew indices of all our variables except A1 are
found to be within 2.00, which indicate these variables may
be skewed but not extremely skewed. However, skew index
of A1 is found to be -4.27, which is beyond the recom-
mended absolute value of 3.00 and could be cause of concern
as the multivariate normality assumption among the indica-
tor variables is violated and not handled properly (Kline,
2011).
Test of the Structural Equation Model
We tested both the measurement model and the structural
model in a single step with lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012)
version (05-15) in R (R Development Core Team, 2013).
Although lavaan provides two default estimators for han-
dling ordinal data (when multivariate normality assumption
is violated)--the diagonally weighted least square (DWLS)
estimator and the robust mean and variance adjusted
weighted least square (WLSMV) estimator--we will only
report the results of the WLSMV estimator as it is robust and
reported to be better than the DWLS estimator.
We have used the absolute fit index (2) and approximate
fit indices to assess our models. As the 2 fit index is sensi-
tive to sample size, Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson (2010)
suggested the use of the ratio of 2 to its degrees of freedom
(2/df) with a ratio of 3.0 or less to be an indicator of accept-
able fit. Approximate fit indices include root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA) index, which is a stand-
alone, badness of fit index (lower the better) that takes

complexity of the model into account. Second, Bentler's
comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker­Lewis index (TLI)
are goodness of fit indices (higher the better) that compare a
model with its baseline model.
The Initial Model
The initial model consisting of unidimensional constructs,
value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-extrinsic, value-
altruistic, expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic,
expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-
experience, social-suggestions, and their corresponding indi-
cators are given in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 4 gives the results
of the test with 455 observations, 53 indicator variables, and
the recommended level of acceptable fit (Hair et al., 2010).
It is seen that the WLSMV estimator reported 2 value of
3,288.105 with 1,271 degrees of freedom. The CFI has a
value of 0.882 and RMSEA a value of 0.059. As the CFI
index is below 0.90, it indicates that the model is not a good
fit and needs to be improved.
The Revised Model
So far, we have focused on the indicator variables that only
link with a single factor. However, various operationaliza-
tions of intrinsic, extrinsic, and altruistic motivations have
resulted in a lack of definitional precision and overlapping
categorizations (Watt & Richardson, 2007). For example,
B5: "A career that provides an intellectual challenge," which
could be considered a form of intrinsic motivation could also
be referred to as a form of extrinsic motivation. Thus, a
cross-loading link has been established so that the indicator
B5 also measures the bExtr construct. Similarly, other indi-
cators, "A career that provides mobility" (B15), "A career
that's well respected" (B11), and "A career with a reasonable
workload" (B12), are allowed to measure the expectancy-
extrinsic motivational construct as these factors are not
needed in doing the teaching job itself. Moreover, "A career
that provides long-term security" (B4) is cross-loaded to the
expectancy-environment construct as having a secured job
adds pleasantness to the overall environment. In this revised
model, we have added a total of seven cross-loadings that
have the largest modification indices and those that theoreti-
cally make sense. To keep the parsimony of the resulting
model, we have minimized this ad hoc exploratory phase
until we got acceptable CFI and TLI indices greater than
0.90. The detailed list of constructs, their corresponding
measures, and the added cross-loadings are given in Table 5.
Finally, the model fit indices of this refined model are given
in Table 6.
Looking at the absolute fit indices of the model, we see
that WLSMV estimator reported a 2 value of 2,663.956 with
1,264 degrees of freedom, 2/df is 2.108 (<3.0). The approxi-
mate fit indices give a CFI value of 0.918 (>0.9), a RMSEA
value of 0.049, with a 90% confidence interval of [0.047,
0.052], and the p value for RMSEA 0.05 is 0.658 indicating
that the model fit is acceptable for sample size of 455 and 53
indicators (Hair et al., 2010). Performing a chi-square differ-
ence of test between the intermediate model and the final
model gives a 2 difference of 624.948 with 7 degrees of
freedom and a p value < .001. All these results indicate a
positive support for our revised model.

We found that all factor loadings were significant at p<
.001. The measures of the indicator variables linked with the
constructs, their mean, standard deviation, and the reliability
coefficients are given in Table 7. It is seen that the reliability
coefficients (the Cronbach's ) ranged from a low of .71 to a
high of .92 (.7 or higher is better) giving confidence in the
overall internal consistency or the degree to which responses
are consistent across the items within a measure (Kline,
2011).
Table 8 presents the correlation coefficients among the
constructs used in the study. We found that all pair-wise cor-
relations of the constructs are significant at p < .001. The
highest correlation coefficients are found to be between aIntr
and aExtr (0.769), which is much less than the recommended
range <.90 (Kline, 2011), giving confidence in the discrimi-
nant validity of the model.
Testing the hypothesis.It is also seen that in addition to the
statistical significance of factor loadings in the measurement
equation, the cross-factor loadings are also significant. The
regression coefficients (of the structural part) that we are
interested in, for statistical inferences, are given in Table 9. It
is seen that the regression coefficients for bEnv, bIntr, dMe-
dia, dPrior, and dSugg are highly significant each with a p
value of  .003. The positive path coefficients of bEnv,
dPrior, and dSugg to C1 suggest that the students who are yet
to choose a career and expect teaching would provide the
factors that they value highly are likely to choose a teaching
career due to a pleasant career, pleasant environment, col-
leagues they will get along with, a career that provides long-
term security, prior experience teaching, and influence from
friends and parents.
Second, the regression coefficients for aEnv, aIntr, aExtr,
and aAltr are all non-significant at the 5% level with p values
of .189, .155, .486, and .535, respectively, implying value-
related factors have no influence in choosing a career in
teaching. The path coefficient from the bExtr construct to C1
is also found to be non-significant at the 5% level with a p
value of .804 indicating no impact of extrinsically motivated
factors (in the overall model) for choosing a career in
teaching.
Third, the negative path coefficient in dMedia suggests
that respondents are discouraged by the information from the
media about teachers' low salary (hence low social status)
and dealing with disruptive students and are less likely to
choose a teaching career. The negative path coefficient in
bIntr suggests that intrinsically motivated students who
expect teaching would provide their valued career factors are
less likely to choose a career in teaching. This may be due to
the fact that the participants may not be looking for a teach-
ing career with intellectual challenge, with responsibility,
and with opportunities to contribute positively to the society
and helping youths and other people if the environment in
which they work is perceived to be unpleasant.
Discussion
A four-section survey instrument was utilized to better
understand how undergraduate students in a Midwestern uni-
versity perceive a career in teaching. The sections contain
items corresponding to what factors they value in a career,
whether they expect teaching to provide those factors, how
social-influence factors influence their perceptions of a
teaching career, and the respondents' likelihood of choosing
a teaching career.
We used EFA techniques to identify and categorize the
items along 10 constructs. There were four constructs in the
value section, which were related to environment, intrinsic
motivation, extrinsic motivation, and altruistic motivation.
In the expectancy section, which deals with teaching as a
career in context, three constructs were found to be sufficient
and were related to environment, intrinsic motivation, and
extrinsic motivation. Finally, in the social-influence section,
three constructs were identified and were related to media on
education, prior teaching experience, and influence from
friends and family. Our objective of the study was to exam-
ine the effect of value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-
extrinsic, value-altruistic, expectancy-environment,
expectancy-intrinsic, expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-
education, social-prior-experience, and social-suggestions
on the likelihood of choosing a career in teaching.
We have used SEM to do our analysis. Because of extreme
kurtosis and skewness in one of the indicators (A1), we
treated the data as ordinal (the way they were collected using
survey) as the multivariate normality assumption among the
indicators was violated. We have started with an initial model
with each indicator loading only on one construct. The result-
ing output gives a CFI value of 0.882 and a RMSEA value of
0.059. For a sample size of 455 and 53 indicator variables,
the recommended CFI value is 0.90 and recommended
RMSEA value is 0.07 (provided CFI  0.9; Hair et al.,
2010). As our CFI index value is slightly lower than the rec-
ommended value of 0.90, we needed to improve the model to
Padhy et al. 9
see any theoretically justified respecification can be made
using modification indices.
Using highest modification indices that are theoretically
justified, we have included cross-loadings of seven indica-
tors that helped to improve the model fit. For example, items
"A career that provides intellectual challenge" (B5), "A
career that provides mobility" (B15), "A career that's well
respected" (B11), and "A career with a reasonable workload"
(B12) are allowed to measure expectancy-extrinsic motiva-
tional construct as these factors not needed in doing the
teaching job itself. Similarly, "A career that provides long-
term security" (B4) is cross-loaded to expectancy-environ-
ment construct, as having a secured job adds pleasantness to
the overall environment.
The revised model gives a 2 value of 2,663.956 with
1,264 degrees of freedom, 2/df as 2.108 (<3.0), CFI value of
0.918, and a RMSEA value of 0.049, which are enough to
meet the requirement for an acceptable model. All factor
loadings were found to be significant and the maximum cor-
relation coefficient between two constructs is found to be
0.769 giving confidence in the discriminant validity. The
reliability coefficients (Cronbach's ) of the exogenous con-
structs of the final model were found to be from a low of .71
to high .92 giving confidence in the overall internal consis-
tency (Kline, 2011) of the model.
A critical question in SEM involves how large a sample is
needed to produce trustworthy results and opinion varies on
this. Typical rules of thumb include but are not limited to (a)
N 200, (b) N/p 10 (Myers, Ahn, & Jin, 2010), where N is
the sample size and p is the number of indicator variables.
Thus, the first condition N 200 is satisfied, which is the
minimum size needed for any SEM model. With p = 53, we
have N/p = 8.58, which is slightly lower than the value of 10
needed. Research also shows that required sample size is
affected if the multivariate normality of data is violated, by
the estimation technique used, and by the model complexity
and average error variance among the reflective indicators
(Hair et al., 2010). For our case, we have used robust
WLSMV estimator, which is found to perform very well
(Myers et al., 2010) for ordinal data (i.e., where multivariate
normality is violated). Even if we have a complex model
with 260 parameters to be estimated, the average error vari-
ance among reflective indicators or the convergent validity is
found to be satisfactory, the maximum correlation coefficient
among the constructs is found to be 0.769 (<0.90), which
solidifies the discriminant validity, and the Cronbach's alpha
(reliability) for constructs has values from .71 to .92 (.7 or
above is better) asserting the internal consistency of the
model. Finally, as the model fit is found to be satisfactory
and has met all recommended fit indices range with few

theoretically justified cross-loading additions to our original
proposed model, we could undoubtedly conclude our find-
ings that for students who are yet to choose a career, the
expectation of teaching offering a pleasant environment and
the social influences play a prominent role in choosing a
teaching career.
Implications for Recruitment
Our results show that respondents' highly valued career fac-
tors had little relationship to their likelihood of teaching.
Rather, students' expectations of teaching and the influence
of a variety of related previous experiences were the strongest
predictors of increased likelihood of considering teaching as
a career option. The highest positive (0.895) and significant
regression path coefficient from expectancy-environment to
likelihood of teaching indicates that an understanding of the
teaching environment, including the items "Colleagues that I
can get along with," "A career that I find enjoyable," and "A
pleasant working environment,", plays an important role in
choosing a career in teaching. This agrees with the findings of
Kyriacou and Coulthard (2000) who did not use SEMs for
their study. Our results indicate that students must be confi-
dent that the working environment of schools, including other
faculty and staff with whom they work, will provide a posi-
tive and collegial atmosphere, which they will enjoy. Prior
experiences such as having taught others, a self-perceived tal-
ent for working with others, teachers whom they have known,
and a desire to share their knowledge with others contribute to
students' openness to teaching. In addition, the positive sup-
port of parents and friends has a positive influence on stu-
dents' likelihood of considering teaching as a career.
Second, the statistically significant but negative regres-
sion path coefficient for the expectancy-intrinsic construct
suggests that those who are less likely to choose a career in
teaching are less likely to choose a career based on their
intrinsic motivations and more likely to be guided by their
expectations of extrinsic factors. One possible explanation is
that students have low expectations of teaching to provide
factors such as an intellectual challenge, professional respon-
sibility, a reasonable workload, professional respect and
career mobility, the ability to make positive contributions to
society, the opportunity to utilize disciplinary knowledge,
and the opportunity to care for others, to help others, and to
work with children and youth, and to be a career that com-
bines easily with parenthood. These are the kinds of career
attributes that need to be addressed in a recruitment program
so that students have accurate expectations of a career in
teaching. It is possible that respondents to this survey viewed
teachers as classroom technicians with little ability to exer-
cise personal expertise and choice in working to bring about
change in the lives of students.
Media reports on education have a negative impact on
students' likelihood to consider teaching. Students are dis-
couraged by the social status of teachers, what they have
heard about schools, and media reports on education.
Students need a strong understanding of financial aspects of
teaching such as teachers'salaries and the amount of funding
schools receive. Although teacher educators may feel some-
what helpless in rectifying broader societal issues, we feel it
is important that these concerns be discussed openly and
frankly with potential recruits. Finally, the idea of dealing
with disruptive students has a negative influence on students'
likelihood of teaching. Recruitment programs could educate
students about characteristics of teachers who effectively
maintain classroom discipline so potential recruits under-
stand that teachers can be proactive and effective in main-
taining good class control.
The findings suggest that a good recruitment program will
educate potential teachers about the career so they know
what to expect and can make an informed choice as to
whether teaching will be a fulfilling career. Potential teach-
ers benefit from the opportunity to experience teaching situ-
ations to see whether they enjoy working with others in a
teaching capacity. A recruitment program could provide
interested students with these opportunities through such
activities as volunteering in local school classrooms, work-
ing with children in after-school programs, or tutoring
younger students who are struggling in their studies. Such
opportunities would provide possible recruits to experience
teaching to better discern whether the profession is one they
would enjoy.
This study is limited in that results are drawn from data
that are captured from students taking courses during a single
semester in a single Midwestern university in the United
States and does not include students' gender or race. Another
limitation is that given a response rate of 35% (458 out of
1,300) for this online survey, one must consider the possibil-
ity of self-selection. It should also be noted that arts and
humanities students were underrepresented in the sample
while natural sciences students were overrepresented.
Finally, our target population for the survey was first- and
second-year undergraduates as we believe this age group to
contain a higher percentage of students still uncommitted to
any career. We were successful at getting responses largely
from this younger demographic, but we need to recognize
that responses from older students and undergraduates fur-
ther along in their studies may be different. Future research
could include more representative samples from different
regions of the United States and compare the factors that
influence a career in teaching with respect to students' gen-
der, race, socio-economic status, region, and how percep-
tions vary among those who do intend to teach. Second,
longitudinal studies could be designed to examine how
change in students' perceptions of teaching change over
time.
