Genetic Analysis
Introduction
Numerous contributions have been made regarding the overall
genetic and environmental influences on obesity at a given time
point in life (1), yet little is known about effects over the life-
cycle. Family studies characterizing genetic and environmental
components of BMI change estimate heritability between 14
and 37% (2­4). Yet results may not be generalized across the
lifecycle, particularly during periods of high risk, such as the
transition from adolescence to young adulthood (5). Likewise,
the effect of household may vary across the lifecourse (6). In
addition, modest correlations between baseline BMI and BMI
change in adult twins suggest that there may be some genetic
variants for BMI change that are distinct from those affect-
ing BMI level (7,8). We followed an ethnically diverse, sibling
cohort to examine the role of shared household environment
and additive genetic effects on BMI change from adolescence
to adulthood.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
is a nationally representative, longitudinal survey following 20,745
adolescents (Wave I, 1994­1995) in grades 7­12 and their parents
into adulthood. Wave II (1996, n = 14,438) included Wave I adoles-
cents who had not graduated from high school, including 
drop-outs.
Wave III (2001­2002, n = 15,197) included all located Wave I respond-
ents, aged 18­27 years. Survey procedures described elsewhere (9)
were approved by the institutional review board, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Family subsample
Add Health included a respondent subsample matched with up to five
related and nonrelated adolescents per household (mean, 2.1 ± 0.4
individuals/household across 5,524 Wave I respondents living in 2,639
households. We limited our sample to 4,782 adolescents (in 2,302
households) sharing household/physical environments for 10 years
at Wave I (Figure 1). In Wave III, 4,588 participants were surveyed as
young adults; 913 individuals (in 449 households) continued living with
another survey respondent, excluding participants who were severely
disabled (n = 100), pregnant (Wave II, n = 75; III, n = 94), or miss-
ing BMI (Wave II, n = 450; III, n = 613). Twin zygosity determined
by 
molecular markers, non-twin sibships classified by self-report
(http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/) (10).
BMI
BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from measured height and weight,
assessed at Waves II and III using standardized procedures. Self-
reported height and weight were substituted for those refusing meas-
urement and/or weighing more than scale capacity (Wave II, n = 54;
III, n = 155) (5). Obesity was defined as BMI 95th percentile of the
National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reference curves (11) in adolescence and the BMI 30
cut-point in adulthood (12).

The complex interplay between genes and environment affecting body mass gain over lifecycle periods of risk is
not well understood. We use longitudinal sibling cohort data to examine the role of shared household environment,
additive genetic, and shared genetic effects on BMI and BMI change. In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, siblings and twin pairs sharing households for 10 years as adolescents (N = 5,524; mean = 16.5 ± 1.7 years)
were followed into young adulthood (N = 4,368; mean = 22.4 ± 1.8 years). Using a variance component approach, we
quantified genetic and household effects on BMI in siblings and nonsiblings sharing household environments over
time. Adjusting for race, age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction, we detected a heritability of 0.43 ± 0.05 for BMI change.
Significant household effects were noted during the young adulthood period only (0.11 ± 0.06). We find evidence for
shared genetic effects between BMI and BMI change during adolescence (genetic correlation (
G
) = 0.61 ± 0.03) and
young adulthood (
G
= 0.23 ± 0.06). Our findings support a complex etiology of BMI and BMI change.

Genetic Analysis
Statistical methods
To identify and evaluate the genetic and environmental contributions
to BMI and BMI change we used a variance component approach
implemented in SOLAR (13), which is explained in detail in previous
publications (14,15) and briefly summarized in the Supplementary
Methods and Procedures online. All models were adjusted for race,
age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction.
Results
From adolescence (mean age = 16.5 ± 1.7 years) to young adult-
hood (mean age = 22.4 ± 1.8 years) BMI increased from 22.9 ±
4.9kg/m2 to 26.2 ± 6.2kg/m2 and overweight/obesity rose from
11.3 to 21.6%. Mean BMI change was 3.2 ± 3.4kg/m2.
Adjusting for race, age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction,
we estimated a heritability of 0.43 ± 0.05 for BMI change
(Table 1).
Though slightly higher in whites, heritability was fairly simi-
lar across ethnicity. Due to power restrictions, we were only
able to interrogate the household effect in the full sample,
where significant household effects were noted during young
adulthood (Table 2). Moreover, the additive genetic signal was
reduced once household variance was incorporated.
Findings suggest shared genetic effects between BMI level
and during adolescence (
G
= 0.61 ± 0.03; P = 0.001) that weak-
ened in adulthood (
G
= 0.23 ± 0.06; P = 0.01).
Discussion
We found moderate to strong evidence for the additive effects
of genes influencing BMI change in a nationally representa-
tive, ethnically diverse sibling cohort of adolescence followed
into young adulthood. These heritability estimates are higher
than those from other family studies (2­4), perhaps due to
the large variance in BMI change during this critical period of
weight gain or to features of our study design, i.e., the sample
is primary composed of sibling pairs. The heritability estimates
were most similar to those reported by Rice et al., in partici-
pants from the Longitudinal Quebec Family Study, where they
calculated heritability for BMI change of 37% over a 12-year
period. This heritability estimate was mainly driven by correla-
tions between young adult siblings, ranging in age from 19 to
31 years between the two BMI measurements. In comparison
to other family studies, this study may have been most similar
in age to the Add Health cohort. However, direct comparison
of heritability estimates across studies is problematic due to
differences in study designs, ascertainment schemes, methods
of parameter estimation, and population-specific environmen-
tal contributions to the phenotypic variance (16). The vast
majority of literature on heritability is in European samples.
Taking advantage of our large, ethnically diverse sample, we
found that residual heritability was fairly similar across ethnic-
ity, although power limitations precluded estimation of ethnic-
specific interactions.
Household effects are attributable to unmeasured non-
genetic factors (e.g., dietary or lifestyle factors) that are shared
more closely by members of the same (versus different) house-
hold (16). We found household effects at young adulthood, but
not during adolescence perhaps because dietary and physical
activity behaviors of adolescents likely mirror parental and
sibling behaviors while they live in the same household (17),
but may change as young adults move out and establish their
own households. Thus, the differences in household behaviors
become more varied as siblings move away from each other
and their parents.
Conversely, shared genetic effects between BMI level and
change were stronger during adolescence than young adult-
hood. Research in adult twins similarly shows low genetic
correlation between BMI level and change (suggesting little
overlap in the genetic variants influencing these phenotypes),
which coupled with our findings provide support for distinct
genetic effects (7,8).
In summary, our findings suggest that BMI change, particu-
larly in adolescence, may be an important trait for mapping
genes related to obesity. In addition, our findings support pre-
vious findings of a complex etiology of BMI change, involving
genetic and environmental components.
