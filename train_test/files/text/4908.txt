Abstract
The question I address in this article is how we might understand the role of the teacher in
education that seeks to promote emancipation. I take up this question in conversation with
German and North-American versions of critical pedagogy with, the works of Paulo Freire and
with that of Jacques Rancie
`re. I show that in each case we find not only a strong argument for
emancipatory education but also a distinct view about the role of the teacher. My aim is partly to
show the different ways in which the role of the teacher in emancipatory education can be
conceived and to make clear how this role is related to the different understandings of
emancipation and the dynamics of emancipatory education. The motivation for writing this
article also stems from what I see as a rather problematic interpretation of the work of
Rancie
`re in recent educational scholarship, one where the key message of his 1991 book The
Ignorant Schoolmaster is taken to be that anyone can learn without a teacher and that this alleged
`freedom to learn' would constitute emancipation. I challenge such a constructivist interpretation
of Rancie
`re's work and argue that the key message of The Ignorant Schoolmaster is that
emancipatory education is not a matter of transfer of knowledge from a teacher who knows
to a student who does not (yet) know, but nonetheless is a process in which teachers and their
teaching are indispensable. This will allow me to argue why and how teaching remains essential for
emancipatory education and why we should therefore not be fooled into thinking that ignorant
schoolmasters, because they have no knowledge to give, have nothing to teach and can be done
away with.

Introduction: In search of the teacher
The question I seek to address in this article is how we might understand the role of the
teacher in education that seeks to promote emancipation. I approach this question in
conversation with the German and with that of North-American versions of critical
pedagogy, with the work of Paulo Freire and Jacques Rancie
` re. In each case, we cannot
only find a strong argument for emancipatory education, but also a distinctive view about the
role of the teacher. My aim is partly to show the different ways in which the role of the teacher
in emancipatory education can be conceived and to make clear how this role is related to
different understandings of emancipation and the dynamics of emancipatory education. But
the motivation for writing this article also stems from what I see as a rather problematic
interpretation of the work of Rancie
` re in recent educational scholarship, one where the key
message of The Ignorant Schoolmaster (Rancie
` re, 1991) is taken to be that anyone can learn
without a teacher and that this alleged `freedom to learn' would constitute a, or perhaps even
the, `moment' of emancipation (for a discussion on this, see Biesta and Bingham, 2012;
Pelletier, 2012; see also Engels-Schwarzpaul, 2015; Stamps, 2013).
In this article I seek to challenge this interpretation of Rancie
` re's work and will argue that
the key message of The Ignorant Schoolmaster is rather that emancipatory education is not a
matter of transfer of knowledge from a teacher who knows to a student who does not (yet)
know, but nonetheless is a process in which teachers and their teaching are indispensable.
What complicates the discussion is the fact that in his later work ­ and here I will particularly
focus on Rancie
` re's essay `The emancipated spectator' (Rancie
` re, 2009: chapter 1) ­
Rancie
` re seems to have `forgotten' this message himself and seems to be turning the
argument for emancipatory teaching into an argument about emancipatory learning, in
other words, focusing on the freedom of students and other `spectators' to construct their
own meanings and understandings (for a similar `problem' in Rancie
` re's engagement with
the work of Althusser, see Lewis, 2012: 31).2 By showing how such a constructivist
interpretation goes against what I consider to be Rancie
` re's unique contribution to the
discussion about educational emancipation, I will also be able to articulate with more
precision why and how teaching is indispensable for emancipatory education and why we
should therefore not be fooled into thinking that ignorant schoolmasters, because they have
no knowledge to give, have therefore nothing to teach and can be done away with.
Education as a matter of emancipation3
The idea that education is not just about the perfection of individuals through their
engagement with culture and history ­ a line of thought particularly prominent in the
Greek idea of paideia (paid"0a) and in some conceptions of the idea of Bildung (for a
critical discussion, see Heydorn, 1972; Klafki, 1986) ­ but ultimately has to do with their
existence as autonomous subjects (Drerup, 2015) and thus with their emancipation, has been
part of the modern educational experience at least since Rousseau (Løvlie, 2002). If paideia
was an education for free men to further their freedom as citizens and in this regard stood in
opposition to the education meant for manual labourers and artisans, the banausoi
(b0nausoi) (Jaeger, 1945), the modern experience came to see education as a process that
should bring about freedom. It thus conceived of education as a process of liberation.
While some authors were interested in the ways in which education might contribute to
such liberation, others made the stronger claim that education is necessary for such
liberation. The often quoted opening sentence of Kant's essay `An answer to the question
Biesta 53
``What is Enlightenment?''' in which he defines enlightenment as the human being's `release
from his self-incurred tutelage' and saw tutelage or immaturity as `man's inability to make
use of his understanding without the direction from another' (Kant, 1992 [1784]: 90),
provides a telling example of the latter approach, particularly when combined with the
claim from his essay on education that human beings can only become human through
education and are nothing but for what education makes of them (see Kant, 1982: 701).4
From here the emancipatory impetus developed along two lines, one which we might call
child-centred or psychological, and another which we might call society-centred or
sociological. The first followed Rousseau's insight that adaptation of the child to the
external societal order would corrupt the child, which led to the idea that a choice for the
child could only mean a choice against society. This line of thought not only played an
important role in the establishment of education as an independent academic discipline in
Germany towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century (see Biesta,
2011). It was also central to child-centred forms of education that emerged around the time
under such names as `progressive education', `Reformpa
¨ dagogik' or `e
´ ducation nouvelle'.
These developments were further supported by theories that conceived of the child as a
natural category and a `given', and not as something that had to be understood in social,
historical or political terms.
In the German context, the limitations of this understanding of emancipatory education
became painfully clear when it turned out that theories and practices that focused exclusively
on `the child' could easily be inserted into a wide range of different ideological systems,
including Nazism and fascism (see, for example, Klafki and Brockmann, 2003). This is why
after the Second World War, educators and educationalists in Germany such as Herwig
Blankertz and Klaus Mollenhauer turned to Marxist and neo-Marxist thought, including the
early work of Ju
¨ rgen Habermas, in order to develop what in Germany became known as
`kritische Pa
¨ dagogik' (for example, Mollenhauer, 1976 [1968]). About two decades later, but
with precursors in the work of `social reconstructionist' educationalists such as George
Counts (see Stanley, 1992), a similar strand of work emerged in North America through
the work of authors such as Michael Apple, Henry Giroux and Peter McLaren under the
name of `critical pedagogy'. As a critical theory of and for education, the emancipatory
interests of these forms of critical pedagogy focused on the analysis of oppressive structures,
practices and theories with the ambition to bring about `demystification' and `liberation
from dogmatism' (phrases used by both McLaren and Mollenhauer; see McLaren, 1997:
218; Mollenhauer, 1976: 67).
The modern logic of emancipation and its contradictions
The concept of emancipation that emerges from this line of thinking is one that conceives of
emancipation as liberation from the oppressive workings of power. A crucial step in the
process of emancipation therefore consists of exposing the workings of power ­
demystification ­ because it is assumed that only when we know how power works and
how it works upon us that we can begin to liberate ourselves and others from it. What the
Marxist tradition added to this ­ and this, in turn, has had a crucial influence on critical and
emancipatory pedagogies ­ is the notion of ideology. Although the question of the exact
meaning of this concept is a topic of ongoing debates (see Eagleton, 2007), one of the key
insights expressed in the concept of ideology is not only that all thought is socially
determined ­ following Marx's dictum that `it is not the consciousness of man that
54 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
determines their being but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their
consciousness' (Marx, quoted in Eagleton, 2007: 80) ­ but also, and more importantly,
that ideology is thought `which denies this determination' (Eagleton, 2007: 89).
The latter claim is linked to Friedrich Engels' notion of false consciousness: the idea that
`the real motives impelling [the agent] remain unknown to him' (Engels, quoted in Eagleton,
2007: 89). The predicament of ideology lies in the claim that it is precisely because of the way
in which power works upon our consciousness that we are unable to see how power works
upon our consciousness. This not only implies that in order to free ourselves from the
workings of power we need to expose how power works upon our consciousness. It also
means that in order for us to achieve emancipation, someone else, whose consciousness is not
subjected to the workings of power, needs to provide us with an account of our objective
condition (on this theme see also Honig, 2003). According to this line of thought, therefore,
emancipation is ultimately contingent upon the truth about our objective condition, a truth
that can only be generated by someone who is positioned outside of the influence of ideology
­ and in the Marxist tradition, this position is considered to be occupied either by science or
by philosophy.
This line of thought not only provides us with a particular `logic' of emancipation ­ one
that sees emancipation as a liberation from oppressive power structures and processes ­ but
also provides us with a particular `logic' of emancipatory education, one that seeks to bring
about such liberation through acts of `demystification' and `liberation from dogmatism', as
mentioned above. Key to the modern `logic' of emancipation is the idea that emancipation
requires a particular intervention from the `outside' by emancipators who themselves are not
subjected to the power that needs to be overcome. This intervention takes the form of
demystification, that is, of revealing to the ones to be emancipated what their objective
condition is. This not only makes emancipation into something that is done to someone
but also reveals that emancipation is based upon an assumed inequality between the
emancipator and the one being emancipated, an inequality that will only be resolved in
the future when emancipation has been achieved or brought about.
It is presumably not too difficult to recognise a particular pedagogy in this depiction of
the modern `logic' of emancipation. This is a pedagogy where the teacher knows and, more
specifically, knows something about the objective condition of the student, and where it is,
therefore, the task of the teacher to explain this condition to the student with the ambition
that the student ultimately becomes like the teacher or, to be more precise, that the student
moves from a situation of ignorance about his or her objective position to one of knowledge
and understanding, similar to the knowledge and understanding the teacher already
possesses. Such a situation may be described as one of equality.
As I have discussed elsewhere in more detail (Biesta, 2010a), the modern `logic' of
emancipation is not without problems and not without contradictions. One problem is the
fact that although emancipation is aimed at liberation of the one to be emancipated, it actually
installs dependency at the very heart of the act of emancipation. After all, the one to be
emancipated is dependent upon a `powerful intervention' by the emancipator in order to
gain his or her freedom. More importantly for the argument in this article, this intervention
is based on knowledge the emancipator claims to have about the objective condition of the one
to be emancipated; knowledge which, before emancipation `arrives', is hidden from the one to
be emancipated. This means that the modern `logic' of emancipation starts from a distrust in
the experiences of the one to be emancipated, suggesting that we cannot really trust what we
see or feel but need someone else to tell us what is really going on.
Biesta 55
Whereas in classical Marxism the Marxist philosopher was supposed to be able to occupy
this position, in our times we often find psychology and sociology in this position, asserting
that they can reveal to us what is really going on in our heads ­ or more often nowadays: our
brains ­ and in our social lives. Rancie
` re captures well what is going on here by highlighting
that under this logic of emancipation we need someone who `lifts a veil off the obscurity of
things', who `carries obscure depth to the clear surface, and who, conversely, brings the false
appearance of the surface back to the secret depths of reason' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 4).
We should not immediately reject the modern `logic' of emancipation, but should at least
try to understand the particular issues it sought to address and the particular `frame' from
which it attempted to do so. Nonetheless, the clear tension between the ambition to liberate
and the claim that this requires someone telling you what is really going on in your head,
may help to see why an encounter with the modern `logic' of emancipation may not
immediately `feel empowering' (Ellsworth, 1989).
Paulo Freire, emancipation and the pedagogy of the oppressed
The contradictions of the modern `logic' of emancipation resonate strongly with what Paulo
Freire has referred to as `banking education', a mode of education where students are turned
into ```receptacles'' to be ``filled'' by the teacher' and where teaching becomes an `act of
depositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher the depositor' (Freire,
1993: 53). The fact that banking education appears to be central to the modern `logic' of
emancipation and emancipatory education raises the interesting question of how Freire's
own conception differs from this ­ a question that is particularly important given Freire's
place in the `canon' of modern critical pedagogy (see, for example, Lankshear and McLaren,
1994). The critical difference, I suggest, has to do with Freire's understanding of oppression,
that is, of that from which we need to be emancipated.
For Freire, oppression is not a matter of one person or group exerting (unwarranted)
power over another person or group, but rather concerns a situation of alienation. Although
alienation may well be the result of one person or group exerting unwarranted power over
another person or group, the exercise of unwarranted power as such does not constitute the
kind of oppression Freire seeks to overcome. Freire rather defines oppression as the situation
where human beings are prevented from being human ­ or as he tends to put it: where human
beings are prevented from being `more fully human' (Freire, 1993: 39).
This not only explains why Freire characterises liberation as a process of humanization,
that is, of becoming more fully human. It also shows why Freire is not after the liberation of
the oppressed from the power of the oppressors, but after liberating them both from the
inauthentic and alienated way of being in their linked identities of oppressor and oppressed,
so that they can `enter the historical process as responsible Subjects' (Freire, 1993: 18). This
also makes clear why Freire's pedagogy is not a pedagogy for the oppressed where, through a
powerful intervention the oppressed are set free, but a pedagogy of the oppressed. Freire
emphasises again and again that `the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed
[is] to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well' (Freire, 1993: 26).5
For Freire, authentic existence is a way of existing as a subject of one's own actions rather
than as the object of someone else's actions. Authentic existence is therefore a matter of
freedom. Yet freedom for Freire is not a matter of just doing what one wants to do, but
encompasses autonomy and responsibility (Freire, 1993: 29; see also Lewis, 2012: 82­86).
Moreover, to exist as subject rather than object does not mean that one exists purely for and
56 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
with oneself. Freire stresses that `world and human beings do not exist apart from each
other, [but] exist in constant interaction' (Freire, 1993: 32). For Freire, the interaction
between human subjects and the world requires both action and reflection. The `action
and reflection of men and women upon their world in order to transform it' is what he
calls praxis (see Freire, 1993: 60). Praxis thus characterises the authentic existence as subject,
which is why Freire sees it as `the new raison d'e
^ tre of the oppressed' (Freire, 1993: 48), that
is, after they have overcome their alienated way of being.
Freire's understanding of oppression as alienation provides the reason why his critique of
banking education is different from common complaints about the transmission conception
of education as a conception informed by a deficient theory of learning. Although Freire
does argue that banking education leads to superficial forms of learning where `words are
emptied of their concreteness and become a hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity'
leading to memorisation but not to real understanding (Freire, 1993: 52), his critique is
not that banking education relies on a misguided learning theory so that all problems are
resolved if we were to allow students to be active constructors rather than passive recipients.
He rather hints at the deeper point that in banking education students can only appear as
objects of the acts of the teacher and not as human subjects in their own right. In banking
education, `the teacher is the Subject of the learning process, while the pupils are merely
objects' (Freire, 1993: 54). Emancipatory education therefore needs to begin with addressing
`the teacher-student contradiction' which in his view can only be done `by reconciling the
poles of the contradiction so that both teachers and students are simultaneously teachers and
students' (Freire, 1993: 53; emphasis in original).
The roles of the teacher in Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed
Freire's `response' to the problems of the modern `logic' of emancipation thus seems to be
one that heralds the end of the teacher. After all, in order to overcome the `teacher-student
contradiction' characteristic of banking education, both the teacher and the student need to
give up the very identity that keeps them in an oppressive and dehumanising relationship.
Instead they need to engage in a relationship which Freire calls dialogue.
Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist and
a new term emerges: teacher-student with student-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-
one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while
being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow.
(Freire, 1993: 61)
One could say that Freire here dissolves the (oppressive) teacher-student relationship of
banking education by turning it into a process of joint learning, joint discovery, of joint
creation of knowledge, although in Freire's vocabulary it is more accurate to say that
banking education is transformed into joint praxis, that is, into an authentic human
existence for both the (former) oppressor and the (former) oppressed. This is no longer a
situation in which the teacher is the one who has knowledge and the students just memorise
the content narrated by the teacher. Instead both are involved in collective acts of inquiry,
inquiry in `fellowship and solidarity' which are `directed towards humanization' (Freire,
1993: 66).
In Freire's hands, the teacher is transformed into a fellow-inquirer, that is, someone
who, always together with their students, is involved in praxis, that is, in transformational
Biesta 57
action-reflection. Here the teacher is a subject with other subjects, rather than a subject
depositing knowledge into objects. In one and the same move, students cease to be `docile
listeners' and become `critical co-investigators in dialogue with the teacher' (Freire, 1993:
62). In this situation, Freire argues, `no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught'
(Freire, 1993: 61).
While at this level the `banking-teacher' disappears and the teacher-as-fellow-inquirer
emerges, it is important to acknowledge that this is not the only figure of the teacher
present in Freire's work. There are at least two more `teachers' to be found in Freire's
writings. This raises the interesting question of how these different identities can be
reconciled. The key here is to see that the image of the teacher-as-fellow-inquirer, as
subject involved in praxis with other subjects, describes the situation where the teacher-
student contradiction has been resolved. It describes, in other words, the situation after
alienation. But the important question for emancipatory education is not so much what
this situation looks like, but how we might get there and whether teachers have anything to do
with moving towards the situation where the teacher-student contradiction has been
resolved.
The first point Freire repeatedly makes in relation to this question is that oppression
cannot be overcome through banking education. `The pedagogy of the oppressed cannot be
developed or practiced by the oppressors' (Freire, 1993: 36), because such a `gesture' ­ which
can take the form, for example, of `false generosity' or `paternalism' ­ `itself maintains and
embodies oppression' (Freire, 1993: 36). This reveals that Freire is well aware of the
contradictions that characterise the modern `logic' of emancipation and their enactment in
educational settings and why he maintains that `the great humanistic and historical task' of
liberation of both the oppressed and the oppressors lies with the oppressed and has to lie with
them (Freire, 1993: 26).
But Freire immediately adds that `if the implementation of a liberating education requires
political power and the oppressed have none', this raises the problem of how the oppressed
can carry out a liberating pedagogy `prior to the revolution' (Freire, 1993: 36). Freire's
response to this predicament is twofold. First, he makes a distinction between two stages
within `libertarian pedagogy', the first in which `the oppressed unveil the world of oppression
and through praxis commit themselves to its transformation', and the second `in which the
reality of oppression has already been transformed, [so that] this pedagogy ceases to belong
to the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy of all people in the process of permanent
liberation' (Freire, 1993: 36).
But ­ and this is the second part of Freire's response ­ the `pedagogy of the first stage'
must deal with another problem too, which is `the problem of the oppressed consciousness'
(Freire, 1993: 37), a consciousness shaped by the very relationship of oppression that needs
to be overcome. While Freire highlights that this `does not necessarily mean that the
oppressed are unaware that they are downtrodden. . . their perception of themselves as
oppressed is [nonetheless] impaired by their submission in the reality of oppression'
(Freire, 1993: 27). `Submerged in this reality', Freire writes, `the oppressed cannot
perceive clearly the ``order'' which serves the interests of the oppressors whose image they
have internalized' (Freire, 1993: 44).
So how is it possible to change this situation? This is perhaps the most delicate aspect of
Freire's theory, because on the one hand, he wants to resist the idea that the oppressed must
be told to become subjects of their own history. Yet on the other, because the `oppressed
consciousness' prevents the oppressed from seeing themselves as subjects of their own
58 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
history, the oppressed need in some way to be `prompted' to become engaged `in the
ontological and historical vocation of becoming more fully human' (Freire, 1993: 48);
they must be `prompted' to `engage in reflection on their concrete situation' on the
assumption that `reflection ­ true reflection ­ leads to action' so that this is not a matter
of `armchair revolution' (Freire, 1993: 48).6
Freire adds two points to this. One is that `action will constitute authentic praxis only if its
consequences become the object of critical reflection', that is, if they bring about `critical
consciousness' (Freire, 1993: 48). The other is that Freire does give a specific name to
those who do the prompting ­ he calls them `revolutionary leaders' (see, for example,
Freire, 1993: 49) ­ though he does emphasise that these are not leaders who lead the
oppressed out of their oppression, but leaders who are involved, alongside the oppressed,
in transformational action-reflection, that is, in praxis. This is why Freire writes that a
process through which they discover themselves as the `permanent re-creators' of reality,
and thus as subjects of their own history can only come about if:
[r]evolutionary leadership . . . practice[s] co-intentional education [where] teachers and students
(leadership and people) co-intent on reality, are both Subjects, not only in the task of unveiling
that reality, and thereby coming to know it critically, but in the task of re-creating that
knowledge.
(Freire, 1993: 51).
In the idea of the `revolutionary leader' we can see a different figure of the teacher at work in
Freire's thought, namely of the teacher as the one who instigates praxis, not as a powerful act
through which the oppressed are liberated from their delusions but by starting up, in a kind
of boot-strapping way, the very transformational action-reflection that characterises the
human way of being in the world. While the `revolutionary leader' is close to the teacher-
student who works with the student-teachers after the revolution, the work of the teacher
before the revolution is at least different in its orientation, as it aims to engage the oppressed
in transformational action-reflection ­ and in his discussion of problem-posing education
(see Freire, 1993: chapter 4) Freire describes in much detail how such engaging of the
oppressed in praxis might be carried out.
While in this way Freire seems to make an interesting case for a form of emancipatory
teaching that does not fall back onto the monological mode of banking education, there is
one further level in Freire's work and hence a third figure of the teacher where Freire is
less successful in resolving the predicament of emancipatory teaching without banking.
This comes into view when we see that in such books as Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire
himself operates as a teacher, not only by telling (other) teachers what they should and
should not do, but also by expressing strong claims about the allegedly true nature of
human beings. After all, as discussed above, Freire defines oppression as the situation
where human beings are prevented from being `more fully human', thus implying that
to overcome alienation means to be closer to what it means to exist in a (more) fully
human way. While Freire's depiction of what it means to be human is not entirely without
reason, it is nonetheless a very particular vision of what it means to be human, and
therefore perhaps one that not everyone will accept or recognise as what all human
beings ought to strive for.
Although Freire's critique of the logic of oppression is original and important, and
although the metaphor of banking education, particularly in the way in which Freire uses
and develops this idea, provides a powerful reference point for the critique of monological
Biesta 59
educational practices in which students can only appear as objects, the way in which Freire
himself appears as a teacher shows that it is perhaps more difficult to escape from a banking
mode of emancipatory education than Freire seems to believe. It is here that Rancie
` re's
account of Joseph Jacotot, the `ignorant schoolmaster', seeks to articulate a different
response to the contradictions of the modern `logic' of emancipation and emancipatory
education.
Rancie
`re, Jacotot and the ignorant schoolmaster
In The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation (Rancie
` re, 1991),
Rancie
` re recounts the story of Joseph Jacotot (1770­1840), a French schoolteacher who
during his exile in Belgium in the first decades of the 19th century developed an
educational approach, which he called `universal teaching'. Jacotot's approach stemmed
from a discovery he made when he was invited to teach French to Flemish students
whose language he didn't speak. What was peculiar about this situation was that there
was `no language in which he could teach what they [his students] sought from him'
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 1). Nonetheless, his students did manage to learn to speak and write
French, which they accomplished through studying a bilingual edition of Fe
´ nelon's novel
Te´le´maque.
Rancie
` re's exploration of the `case' of Jacotot is interesting for two reasons, which are
both connected to the discussion of Freire. One has to do with the fact that Jacotot and his
students did not share a language, so that there was no possibility for Jacotot to deposit any
content in the minds of the students. There was, in other words, no possibility for banking
education. Yet, while in this regard ­ that is in terms of the transmission of knowledge ­
Jacotot wasn't able to teach his students anything, Rancie
` re insists that this doesn't mean
that Jacotot's students learned without a schoolmaster. This means that, in another sense,
Jacotot did teach and did act as a schoolmaster. And it is precisely in relation to this point
that Jacotot ­ at least in the hands of Rancie
` re7 ­ provides a way of overcoming the Freirean
`teacher-student contradiction' that does not result in the dissolution of the teacher in the
way in which I have shown this to be the case in Freire. Let me briefly try to explain how this
is achieved.
Whereas Freire focused his critique on education as a process of banking, Rancie
` re's
critique has a slightly different target as it focuses of the role of explanation. Rancie
` re
contends that in educational settings, explanation offers itself `as a means to reduce the
situation of inequality where those who know nothing are in relation with those who
know' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 3). When teachers explain something to their students, they do
so with the intention of giving their students the knowledge and understanding they do not
yet have. In this sense, it looks reasonable to think of explanation as the way to overcome
the inequality between the teacher who knows and the student who doesn't know yet.
Rancie
` re argues, however, that whereas this may be true when we look at the content
being transmitted from the teacher to the student, the way in which the `act' of explanation is
itself performed communicates something different, namely that explanation is indispensable
for learning and understanding, that is, that students are thought to be unable to understand
without explanation. This is the point Rancie
` re makes when he suggests that `to explain
something to someone is first of all to show him [that] he cannot understand it by himself'
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 6), which means that to explain is `to demonstrate an incapacity' (Rancie
` re,
60 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
2010: 3; emphasis added). Explanation then turns education into what Rancie
` re refers to as
stultification ­ a process that keeps students `in their place', that literally keeps them stupid
and without a voice ­ rather than as a process of emancipation.
Rancie
` re thus suggests that explanation actually enacts and in a sense inaugurates and
then perpetually confirms the inequality of teacher and student. In this set-up it is not so
much that a student is the one who needs explanation. It is rather that the act of explanation
constitutes the student as the one who is unable to learn without explanation, without the
intervention of a `master-explicator'. This leads Rancie
` re to the conclusion that the student
so conceived is actually the product of the `explicative order' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 4), not its
condition. The explicative order is founded upon what Rancie
` re calls the `myth of
pedagogy', which is `the parable of a world divided into knowing minds and ignorant
ones, the capable and the incapable, the intelligent and the stupid' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 6).
The explicator's `special trick' here consists of a `double inaugural gesture' (Rancie
` re,
1991: 6).
On the one hand, he decrees the absolute beginning: it is only now that the act of learning will
begin. On the other, having thrown a veil of ignorance over everything that is to be learned, he
appoints himself to the task of lifting it.
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 6­7)
The intention behind this approach to teaching is generally a laudable one, as the teacher
aims `to transmit his knowledge to his students so as to bring them, by degrees, to his own
level of expertise' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 3). The `art' of the schoolmaster, `who methodically lifts
the veil from that which the student could not understand alone, is the art that promises the
student will one day be the equal of the schoolmaster' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 5). But will this
promise ever be delivered? Is it ever possible to escape from the circle of explanation? Or is it
the case that as soon as one starts out on a trajectory of explanation, one will be there
forever, always trying to catch up, always trying to understand what the explicator already
understands, but always in need of the explicator's explanation in order to understand?8
Viewed in this way explanation is actually `something completely different from a practical
means of reaching some end' and rather appears to be an end in itself. Explanation is `the
infinite verification of a fundamental axiom: the axiom of inequality' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 3).
Rancie
`re's emancipatory teacher
The question this raises is whether it is possible to break away from the circle of powerlessness
`that ties the student to the explicator' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 15)? Rancie
` re suggests that this may
indeed be possible, but not through the introduction of more `refined' or more `progressive'
forms of explanation. Here, Rancie
` re clearly diverges from the path of modern `logic' of
emancipatory education by arguing against the idea that emancipation results from an
explanation of the objective condition of the student. He writes:
The distinction between `stultification' and `emancipation' is not a distinction between methods
of instruction. It is not a distinction between traditional or authoritarian methods, on the one
hand, and new or active methods, on the other: stultification can and does happen in all kinds of
active and modern ways.
(Rancie
` re 2010: 6)
Biesta 61
The more fundamental question that emerges from this discussion is therefore whether it is
possible to teach without explanation, and it is here that the case of Jacotot is relevant,
because it provides us precisely with an example of this.
Yet what is important about the `case' of Jacotot ­ and it is here that Rancie
` re and Freire
diverge ­ is that the case of Jacotot is not one where the teacher had completely withdrawn
and education had turned into collective learning or collaborative inquiry. It rather provides
us with an example of an educational `dynamic' where students learned without a `master-
explicator' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 12; emphasis added). Rancie
` re summarises this by saying that
`Jacotot had taught them something [but] he had communicated nothing to them' (Rancie
` re,
1991: 13). The dissociation of teaching from communication is central to Rancie
` re's
argument and provides one way to understand the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster, as
the educational dynamic that is at stake here is one that no longer relies on the (superior)
knowledge of the schoolmaster. But in what way, then, is the ignorant schoolmaster involved
in teaching?
Rancie
` re characterises the shift that is at stake here with the help of the distinction
between intelligence and will, in that what Jacotot did was not to replace the intelligence
of his students with his own intelligence, but rather to summon his students to use their own
intelligence. The relationship between Jacotot and his students is therefore not a relationship
of intelligence to intelligence but of `will to will' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 13). From this Rancie
` re
concludes that whereas stultification takes place `whenever one intelligence is subordinated
to another', emancipation takes place when an intelligence obeys only itself `even while the
will obeys another will' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 13). What therefore is at the heart of the conception
of emancipatory education that emerges from this, is what Rancie
` re describes as the act of
revealing `an intelligence to itself' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 28).9
Rancie
` re highlights that the route students will take when summoned to use their
intelligence is unknown, but what the student cannot escape is `the exercise of his liberty'
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 23).10 This is why Rancie
` re concludes that there are only two `fundamental
acts' for the schoolmaster: `He interrogates, he demands speech, that is to say, the
manifestation of an intelligence that wasn't aware of itself or that had given up' and `he
verifies that the work of the intelligence is done with attention' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 29; emphasis
in original). What is verified here is not the outcome of the use of intelligence, as this would
return the process to that of explanation, but only the use of intelligence, in other words, that
the `work' of intelligence is done with attention. Rancie
` re emphasises that this interrogation
should not be understood in the Socratic way where the purpose of the interrogation seems
to be that of leading the student to a point that is already known by the master. While
this `may be the path to learning', it is `in no way a path to emancipation' (Rancie
` re, 1991:
29). Central to emancipation, then, is the consciousness `of what an intelligence can do
when it considers itself equal to any other and considers any other equal to itself'
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 39).
Rancie
` re highlights that to start from the assumption of the equality of all speaking
beings is not to assume, naively, that equality exists. It is not to assume that he has a
special insight into how inequality exists and how it can be transformed into equality.
Rancie
` re actually writes that about inequality `there is nothing to know' (Rancie
` re,
2010: 4) ­ which adds another layer of meaning to the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster.
Inequality is no more a given to be transformed by knowledge than equality is an end to be
transmitted through knowledge. Equality and inequality are not two states. They are two
62 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
`opinions', that is to say two distinct axioms, by which educational training can operate, two
axioms that have nothing in common. All that one can do is verify the axiom one is given. The
schoolmaster's explanatory logic presents inequality axiomatically . . . The ignorant
schoolmaster's logic poses equality as an axiom to be verified. It relates the state of inequality
in the teacher-student relation not to the promise of an equality-to-come that will never come,
but to the reality of a basic equality.
(Rancie
` re, 2010: 5)
The point for Rancie
` re, in short, is not to prove the equality of intelligence, `It's seeing what
can be done under that supposition' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 46).
The figure of the ignorant schoolmaster that emerges from Rancie
` re's discussion of
Jacotot ­ and I wish to emphasise one more time that what we are looking at is
Rancie
` re's `use' of the case of Jacotot, not Jacotot himself ­ is important in the context of
the question of whether teaching has a role to play in education that aims at emancipation. It
is important to keep this focus in mind, that is, to see the figure of the ignorant schoolmaster
as having to do with the question of emancipatory education, and not to see it as a paradigm
for all dimensions of education.
Rancie
` re's `intervention' is clearly orientated towards the question of how in educational
relationships and settings students can appear and exist as subjects rather than objects and
towards the question of what this requires from the teacher. Rancie
` re's argument is therefore
neither an argument against education as the transmission of knowledge or education as
explanation ­ those `modes' of education are perfectly acceptable if the ambition is to
transmit knowledge or to bring about understanding ­ nor an argument for a kind of
constructivist classroom in which the teacher is only present as a facilitator of learning,
but no longer has something to teach and is no longer allowed to teach something (on the
latter, see Biesta, 2012).
The point I wish to make here ­ and this is crucial for what I seek to do in this article ­
is that Rancie`re's argument is an argument about emancipation and the role of the teacher in
emancipatory education, and not a general theory of education or schooling or the dynamics
of instruction (didactics) (which is why Jacotot's notion of `universal teaching' is
misleading where it concerns the way in which Rancie
` re makes use of Jacotot). At a
very basic level, Rancie
` re's argument is a critique of the idea that emancipation relies
upon some deeper insight about our true human existence which, through an act of
explanation, needs to be transmitted from the emancipator to the one to be
emancipated. In this sense, he appears to be in agreement with Freire's insight that
banking education can never be the method of emancipation. Both Freire and Rancie
` re
disagree with a basic tenet of the modern `logic' of emancipation and emancipatory
education, namely the idea that emancipation rests on providing an explanation of the
objective condition of the one to be emancipated. But there are three ways in which
Rancie
` re's approach differs from Freire's.11
One is that Rancie
` re's approach retains a very explicit and precise task for the teacher and
therefore also retains a very specific identity for the teacher, albeit not in terms of the
transmission of knowledge, but in terms of a relationship at the level of will. Rancie
` re
describes the `logic' of emancipatory teaching in the following way: `The emancipatory
teacher's call forbids the supposed ignorant one the satisfaction of what is known,
the satisfaction of admitting that one is incapable of knowing more' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 6).
The second difference is that for Rancie
` re equality is not some kind of deeper truth about the
human being which would, as I have shown to be the case with Freire, turn emancipatory
Biesta 63
teaching back to the transmission of a truth about the true and objective condition of the one
to be emancipated. For Rancie
` re, equality functions as an assumption, as something that
gives direction to emancipatory teaching; not as a truth upon which it is founded but as a
possibility that constantly asks for what Rancie
` re terms verification; not to be understood as
providing evidence for its truth, but understood in the literal sense of making true, that is,
acting as if it were true in order to see what follows from it. This also means, and this is the
third point where Rancie
` re's approach differs, that equality is not projected into the future as
a state that will only come into existence `after the revolution' (see Thompson, 1997), but is
situated in the here and now.
Three conceptions of emancipatory education:
Liberation, truth and teaching
Comparing the modern `logic' of emancipation with the views of Freire and Rancie
` re reveals
a number of important differences in how emancipation is conceived and how the role of
education ­ and more specifically the role of the teacher ­ is understood. According to the
modern `logic', emancipation is understood as liberation from power. As oppression is not
just understood in material terms but also in what we might call discursive terms ­ the idea of
ideology ­ liberation relies on a teacher who provides the one to be emancipated with the
non-distorted truth about their objective condition.
Freire and Rancie
` re are both critical of the modern `logic' of emancipation, but for different
reasons and with different outcomes. For Freire the main problem seems to be the powerful
position of the teacher, hence he conceives of emancipatory education as a process where the
teacher becomes a fellow-inquirer together with other fellow-inquirers collectively involved in
the action-reflection process called praxis. Freire thus takes the teacher out of the equation
(albeit that he struggles to do so entirely as he still has a role for the revolutionary leader and
ultimately appears as a teacher himself, making claims about the authentic condition of the
human being). This is the reason why he defines oppression as alienation from this authentic
condition and emancipation as a return to this condition.
Against this background we can see that Rancie
` re goes exactly in the opposite direction,
as he gives up on the idea that it is possible or necessary to base emancipation on a truth
about the objective or authentic condition of the human being. But unlike Freire he does
retain a key role for the teacher; not, however, as the one who provides the ones to be
emancipated with knowledge about their objective or authentic condition ­ which is the
reason why the emancipatory schoolmaster is ignorant ­ but by enacting a particular
intervention or `interruption' (see Biesta, 2009), one that, as he puts it, forbids the one to
be emancipated the satisfaction of claiming that one is incapable of learning, thinking and
acting for oneself. Oppression thus appears as the belief that one is unable to learn, think
and act for oneself ­ a rejection of one's freedom ­ and emancipation concerns revealing `an
intelligence to itself' (Rancie
` re, 1991: 28) or, in a more precise formulation, interrupting and
refusing the student's denial of their own freedom.
Simply put, then, the modern logic of emancipation relies on a teacher and truth. Freire
removes the teacher and ultimately retains the role of truth, whereas Rancie
` re retains the
teacher but removes truth. For Rancie
` re emancipation doesn't run on a truth to be
conveyed from the teacher to the student and therefore the emancipatory teacher appears
as ignorant.

Constructivist enthusiasm: The uptake of Rancie
`re
In the foregoing pages I have provided a reconstruction of three different conceptions of
emancipation and three different approaches to emancipatory education. Starting from the
contradictions that are present in the modern `logic' of emancipation, I have presented Freire
and Rancie
` re as providing two different responses to these contradictions. Each takes a
different `horn' of the dilemma posed by the modern logic of emancipation. Whereas
Freire tries to get rid of the authoritarian teacher who prevents students from appearing as
subjects in the educational relationship, we could say that Rancie
` re gets rid of the role of
authoritarian knowledge that prevents students from being different from how they are being
defined by that knowledge and how they come to define themselves by it, namely as incapable.
I have also highlighted that Freire and Rancie
` re introduce different understandings of
oppression and that their views about emancipation respond to those understandings.
My particular interest in this article, however, has been the role, position and identity of the
teacher in emancipatory education, and it is here that I wish to locate the unique contribution
Rancie
` re has made to the discussion, as he has managed to introduce a `third option': This is
the option where teachers actually have something important to do vis-a
`-vis emancipation and are
not seen, as was the case in Freire, as part of the problem. But unlike the idea that teachers
should supplant false consciousness in their students with true consciousness ­ a manoeuvre
that Freire rightly objects to ­ Rancie
` re takes the question of emancipation away from matters
of knowledge and truth. We can see this in the two formulations he provides for the role of the
emancipatory schoolmaster. One formulation is `positive' in the sense that it indicates what
the emancipatory teacher should do, namely `revealing an intelligence to itself'. The other
formulation is `negative' in that it is about forbidding the supposed ignorant one `the
satisfaction of admitting that one is incapable of knowing more'.12
What is remarkable about the uptake of Rancie
` re's work in the field of education is that
many seem to have missed the particular `edge' of Rancie
` re's argument ­ that is, that it's an
argument about the role of knowledge in emancipatory education (and, more specifically, a
rejection of the idea that emancipation `runs' on demystifying knowledge) ­ and have read it
as a general discussion about education-as-instruction rather than a specific discussion of
education-as-emancipation. Moreover, the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster has been read
along the lines of contemporary constructivism, where it seems to have become `common
sense' to claim that in education everything centres around student learning ­ their acts of
sense making ­ and the only thing teachers can do is to facilitate such sense making, but they
cannot ­ and according to some ought not ­ try to transfer knowledge from themselves to
the student.
Pelletier (2012: 615), for example, refers to this view when she writes that `teaching, as all
good, progressive teachers know, is not about transmitting knowledge, but enabling another
to learn'. Engels-Schwarzpaul (2015: 1253­1254) makes a similar claim in her discussion of
Rancie
` re, when she writes that `it is now widely accepted that learning is not based on
the unilateral conveyance of knowledge from teacher to student', but rather that it is
`more effective when students take an active part in knowledge building'. Against this
background, she takes the key message of Rancie
` re's The Ignorant Schoolmaster to be one
of `[encouraging] learning through the use of one's own intelligence, experiment and
experience, attentiveness and persistence' (Engels-Schwarzpaul, 2015: 1255).
There is a similar tendency in the account Chambers (2013) gives of Rancie
` re's
educational theory. Although strongly focusing on political questions, Chambers, where it
Biesta 65
concerns matters of education, comes close to a constructivist reading of Rancie
` re as well,
suggesting that Rancie
` re `advocates an utterly radical pedagogy' centred around a `rejection
of mastery. . . of schoolmasters who know it all, and convey this knowing to their students'
(Chambers, 2013: 639). Chambers thus presents Rancie
` re's `new pedagogy [as] a reversal of
the explicative order's primary assumption', suggesting that what is central to this new
pedagogy is students' `ability' to come to their own understanding (for example of a text)
`without the explanations of a master' (Chambers, 2013: 644). He writes:
When a student picks up a book and reads it for herself (even, as in the case of Jacotot's teaching
experiments, a book written in a language other than her mother tongue), then she is using the
method of equality. This capacity for anyone to read the book without having someone else
telling them what it means ­ this is the power of equality, and this is all there is to equality.
(Chambers, 2013: 644)
Against readings such as these ­ which don't promote a full-blown constructivism but do
tend to take Rancie
` re's argument as a general theory of education that should put the
learning and sense making of students at the centre ­ I wish to maintain that Rancie
` re's
work provides us with an argument about teaching rather than learning and that the
`location' of this argument is in the discussion about educational emancipation.
With regard to the first point ­ that Rancie
` re is presenting an argument for teaching not
for learning ­ the claim Rancie
` re makes in The Ignorant Schoolmaster is therefore not that
anyone can learn without a teacher. This is not because Rancie
` re would disagree with this
claim ­ as it stands, it simply is true ­ but because this is not what the discussion is about.
The claim Rancie
` re rather makes (and here he distinguishes himself both from the modern
`logic' of emancipation and from Freire) is that emancipation doesn't `run' on knowledge
(which is why the argument should be read within the confines of the discussion about
educational emancipation). It neither runs on a truth about the nature of the human
being, nor on a truth about the objective condition of the one to be emancipated. It is for
this reason that an emancipatory teacher should not be understood as a teacher who
possesses such knowledge, which is why the emancipatory teacher is characterised as
`ignorant' (see also Rancie
` re, 2010).
But, to make the point one more time, this is not because the emancipatory teacher lacks
knowledge, but because knowledge is not the `way' of emancipation. Here also lies the
significance of Rancie
` re's claim of equality as an assumption. Unlike Freire, Rancie
` re
doesn't put a strong claim about the authentic existence of the human being on the table ­
and in this sense he is also explicitly un-Kantian ­ but articulates an explicitly political
`interest' and an explicitly political `project'.13
When Rancie
` re writes, therefore, that `learning also takes place in the stultifiers' school'
(Rancie
` re, 1991: 102), it is precisely to show that emancipation is not about learning. There is
not only the point that learning can happen anywhere, with or without a teacher. There is
also the point that to `become' emancipated ­ and it is actually more accurate to say: to be
emancipated ­ is not something that requires learning, but is about using one's intelligence
under the assumption of equality. Doing so is not to reveal a particular capacity ­
particularly not the capacity to learn, interpret or make sense ­ but is rather to inscribe
oneself in the political project of equality (see also Biesta, 2010b). Of course, in order to
use one's intelligence in such a way, no teacher is needed; that is the whole point of using
one's own intelligence. Yet where the emancipatory teacher has a role is in those cases where
students ­ and I would like to add: of any age ­ deny or refuse this option, either by claiming
66 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
that they are unable to think and act for themselves or by expressing that they are unwilling
to think and act for themselves. The emancipatory teacher thus has a role in those situations
where students deny or refuse their possibility for being a subject and prefer to be or remain
an object. The particular intervention of the emancipatory teacher is aimed at this `attitude',
if that's the appropriate term here.14
Rancie
`re reading Rancie
`re
There are two more points to add to the discussion, and they both have to do with
Rancie
` re's own reflections on his work, also in response to the ways others have engaged
with it. One has to do with the question and status of explanation, as there seems to be a
tendency in those commenting on Rancie
` re's work to highlight the irony of trying to explain
what the work is about when it seems to be quite critical of the logic of explanation.
However, as I have tried to indicate in the preceding pages, we should not read
Rancie
` re's argument as a case for the prohibition of explanation (on this, see also Stamp,
2013). Rancie
` re is helpfully clear about this himself when he writes that `we can certainly use
our status as legitimate ``transmitters'' to put our knowledge at others' disposal' and that this
is actually what he himself is `constantly doing' (Rancie
` re, 2010: 245).15 The only point here
is that explanation ­ and particularly the attempt to explain what's really going on in
another person's head or life ­ is not the way of emancipation.
The second point, however, is more problematic from my perspective, as in later work
Rancie
` re seems to be veering towards a constructivist reading of his own work, one where
emancipation becomes understood as the freedom to learn and, more specific, the freedom to
interpret and make sense. In the line just quoted about legitimate transmitters, Rancie
` re
actually continues by saying that `what is ``stultifying'' from a Jacotist perspective is the will
to anticipate the way in which they will grasp what we put at their disposal' (Rancie
` re, 2010:
245). This becomes a bigger theme in The Emancipated Spectator, originally given as a talk in
2004 and subsequently published as chapter 1 in a book with the same title (Rancie
` re, 2009).
Although the discussion in this essay is on questions of theatre and the position of
spectators, Rancie
` re discusses this as an educational problematic as well, making explicit
reference to The Ignorant Schoolmaster.16
In the rendition of the dynamics of education that Rancie
` re provides in this discussion, he
seems to have shifted from a focus on emancipatory teaching to a more general account of
education as a teaching-learning situation ­ or, as I have called it above, a general theory of
instruction. And the account Rancie
` re gives here is one that comes close to a constructivist
reading, where the dynamics of education are not that of transmission of knowledge from
the teacher to the student, but one where students learn through what we might term `trial
and error' ­ in Rancie
` re's words `the path from what she [the student] already knows to what
she does not yet know, but which she can learn just as she has learnt the rest' (Rancie
` re,
2009: 11). Rancie
` re calls this `the poetic labour of translation', which he claims is `at the
heart of all learning' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 10). It is translation because it is a process where the
student moves from what he or she already knows to what he or she does not yet know; and
it is poetic because the student does not repeat what is already there, but invests his or her
own understanding. As Rancie
` re puts it:
From this ignoramus, spelling out signs, to the scientist who constructs hypotheses, the same
intelligence is always at work ­ an intelligence that translates signs into other signs and proceeds
Biesta 67
by comparisons and illustrations in order to communicate its intellectual adventures and
understand what another intelligence is endeavouring to communicate to it.
(Rancie
` re, 2009: 10)
In this account, the teacher also appears in a different way from how I have discussed this
above, namely as a facilitator.
He does not teach his pupils his knowledge, but orders them to venture into the forest of things
and signs, to say what they have seen want what they think of what they have seen, to verify it
and have it verified.
(Rancie
` re, 2009: 11)
What Rancie
` re is describing here, then, is very much an account of learning rather than
an account of teaching. Moreover, it is an account of learning in the general sense of
making sense. And it could be read in constructivist terms, in that each individual ­ we
might even say each individual learner ­ constructs his or her own `story', or with the
phrase Rancie
` re uses: each individual `composes her own poem' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 13). One
thing Rancie
` re highlights in his account of this dynamic is that there is no direct
relationship between the teacher/performer and student/spectator and therefore neither
the ambition (Rancie
` re, 2009: 14) nor the possibility for `uniform transmission'
(Rancie
` re, 2009: 15). There rather is always a `third thing' ­ the work of art, the
theatre performance, a book `or some other piece of writing' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 14­15) ­
that is `alien to both' but to which they can refer `to verify in common what the pupil has
seen, what she says about it and what she thinks of it' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 15). There is,
therefore, a radical openness of interpretation in relation to this `thing', and Rancie
` re
does indeed affirm that `in a theatre, in front of a performance, just as in a museum,
school or street, there are only ever individuals plotting their own paths in the forest of
things, acts and signs that confront and surround them' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 16), which
provides `starting points, intersections and junctions that enable us to learn something
new' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 17).
What is most remarkable about The Emancipated Spectator (Rancie
` re, 2009), at least
from the perspective that I have been pursuing in the previous pages, is that Rancie
` re
seems to locate the emancipatory `moment' precisely in the acts of interpretation of
spectators ­ and by implication in the acts of interpretation of students. In relation to the
`new idiom' that emerges when artists `construct the stages where the manifestation and
effect of their skills are exhibited', Rancie
` re argues that `the effect of the idiom cannot be
anticipated' and that it `requires spectators who play the role of active interpreters, who
develop their own translation in order to appropriate the ``story'' and make it their own
story', from which he concludes that `an emancipated community is a community of
narrators and translators' (Rancie
` re, 2009: 22).
There are two reasons why Rancie
` re seems to end up here is problematic ­ one has to do
with the role of the teacher, the other with the status of emancipation. The first problem with
the constructivist `uptake' of Rancie
` re's work ­ ironically, also by Rancie
` re himself ­ is that
the unique position he had carved out for the teacher in emancipatory education seems to
have disappeared again. Rancie
` re rather seems to be `back' where Freire already was, that is,
with the teacher as a facilitator of learning, a facilitator of students constructing their own
stories. The second problem has to do with the question of whether everyone's freedom to
construct their own story, a freedom which I have referred to elsewhere as the `freedom of
68 Policy Futures in Education 15(1)
signification' (see Biesta, 2016), is a meaningful notion of freedom and hence a meaningful
notion of emancipation.
I doubt that this is the case (for a detailed argument, see Biesta, 2016), because the
question that immediately arises is what the criterion would be upon which we were to
judge the different interpretations, significations or poems that people would come up
with. The freedom of signification thus appears as a kind of neo-liberal freedom, where
everyone is free to articulate their own `story', rather than a political let alone a
democratic freedom where there would always be a question about how the different
`poems' would impact on the ways in which we live our lives together-in-equality, rather
than each of us being enclosed in our own story. This is not only remarkable given the fact
that the idea of equality plays such a key role in Rancie
` re's writings. It is also remarkable
because the figure of the emancipatory teacher that emerges from the reconstruction
provided above precisely depicts emancipatory teaching as an interruption of such a
relativistic set-up where students would only spin around in their own universe ­
emancipatory teaching as an interruption of the refusal to exist as subject.
Conclusions: Don't be fooled by ignorant schoolmasters
In this article I have tried to highlight Rancie
` re's unique contribution to the discussion of
emancipatory education by showing that, unlike what seems to be the thrust of Freire's
view on emancipatory education, there is a clear role, task and identity for the teacher.
Unlike in the case of critical pedagogy, this task is not to be understood as that of
supplanting false consciousness with true consciousness. But unlike Freire, Rancie
` re
doesn't conclude from this that we should do away with the teacher. He rather
highlights the problems with the idea that emancipation `runs' on knowledge. This is
one sense in which the emancipatory teacher can be called ignorant. The other way in
which the emancipatory teacher is ignorant is because this teacher does not start from
knowledge about the alleged incapacity of the student, but rather from the assumption of
the equality of intelligence which, as I have shown, is precisely not a matter of knowledge
or truth (and here again Rancie
` re takes an approach that is fundamentally different from
Freire's).
This, as I have tried to argue, has nothing to do with one way in which Rancie
` re's work
has been interpreted, which is in terms of the idea that everything in education depends on
the meaning making by students, and that teachers can only be facilitators of this process
and actually have nothing to give or anything to add.17 We should therefore not be fooled by
the figure of the ignorant schoolmaster by assuming that schoolmasters who have no
knowledge to give also have no teaching to do and should therefore move to the side of
the classroom to become facilitators of learning. For Rancie
` re the emancipatory
schoolmaster is precisely that: a schoolmaster involved in the act of teaching. And
similarly we should not be fooled by the idea that the freedom to learn and, more
specifically, the freedom of interpretation and signification, is the way in which we
inscribe ourselves in the political project of equality.

Notes
1. A first version of this article was given as an invited keynote lecture at the 2014 Critical Pedagogies
and Philosophies of Education Conference at Liverpool Hope University, UK. I would like to
thank Alex Guilherme for the invitation to present at the conference and for his support in
transforming the presentation into an article. I am also grateful to three anonymous reviewers
for their helpful comments.
2. There are also problems with Rancie
` re's conception of learning (see Citton, 2010; Hallward, 1995).
A discussion of this aspect of Rancie
` re's work lies beyond the scope of this article.
3. In this and the following section I summarise a main line of thought develop in more detail in
Biesta, 2010a.
4. In German: `Der Mensch kann nur Mensch werden durch Erziehung. Er ist nichts, als was die
Erziehung aus ihm macht' (Kant, 1982: 701).
5. In his detailed reading of Freire, Lewis (2012) seems to underplay this particular aspect of Freire's
work and keeps him closer to the neo-Marxist understanding of oppression as the exertion of
unwarranted power by the oppressor(s) over the oppressed, so that the main emancipatory `act' is
that of demystification (see, for example, Lewis, 2012: 104). Although, as I will argue below,
demystification does play a role in Freire's overall conception of emancipatory education, the
basic `logic' of emancipation is conceived in terms of overcoming alienation, not oppressive power.
6. Although here Freire comes closer to the idea of false consciousness, and thus to an understanding
of oppression that is closer to neo-Marxist critical theory, his `solution' at this point is not to revert
to explanation, but rather to joint action (co-intending, in Freire's vocabulary).
7. This is an important point, because many readers of The Ignorant Schoolmaster seem to assume
that Rancie
` re simply provides a description of Jacotot's theory and simply endorses this theory.
While it is sometimes difficult to see where Jacotot ends and Rancie
` re begins, I nonetheless wish to
make a radical distinction between the two and wish to suggest a reading of The Ignorant
Schoolmaster that focuses on the argument Rancie
` re makes `through' the story of Jacotot. It is
of course legitimate to refer to Jacotot's ideas themselves, but in that case I would argue that The
Ignorant Schoolmaster is an unreliable source for this and readers should rather engage with
Jacotot's own writings.
8. What here appears as a set of (rhetorical) questions about teaching, can also be read as a critique of
Bourdieu and particularly of the application of Bourdieu's ideas about cultural (and increasingly
also, social) capital to education ­ see the introduction by Kristin Ross in Rancie
` re (1991).
9. To refer to this as an act of revelation is slightly misleading, as it may reduce Rancie
` re's
emancipatory logic to that of explanation. Below, I will provide a different and in my view
more accurate formulation of emancipatory teaching, one where the act of emancipatory
teaching appears as that of forbidding the student the apparent satisfaction of claiming that one
is unable to learn and know without the help of a teacher-explicator.
10. In comparing Freire and Rancie
` re, Lewis (2012) suggests that in Freire we find a focus on freedom
with little attention to the question of equality; whereas in Rancie
` re, we find a focus on equality
with little attention to the question of freedom. Although it is true that Rancie
` re seeks to articulate
a logic of emancipation that starts from the assumption of equality rather than the assumption of
inequality, Rancie
` re's observation that students cannot escape the exercise of their liberty indicates
that Lewis's claim that `universal teaching remains silent on the question of freedom' (Lewis, 2012:
73) is perhaps not entirely accurate. After all, as I will discuss below, central to the emancipatory
`act' of the teacher is the interruption of the students' denial or rejection of their freedom.

11. For a further discussion of differences and similarities between Freire and Rancie
` re, see Galloway
(2012); see also Lewis (2012).
12. Both formulations sound in a sense remarkably Kantian, as one could imagine that one way in
which the emancipatory teacher might enact this is by telling students that they should have the
courage to use their own intelligence, which is in line with Kant's formulation of the `motto' of
Enlightenment as Sapere aude! ­ have the courage to use your own understanding. On the
dimension of encouragement, see also Sonderegger (2014). While I agree therefore with Lewis
that there is a strong Kantian `streak' in Rancie
` re's work, I would not locate this in the alleged
centrality of the emancipatory teacher's `command' to the students that they should follow their
own path (see Lewis, 2012: 78-79), but with the interruption of the students' denial of their ability
to use their own understanding, that is, a denial of their freedom.
13. In terms of the `uptake' of Rancie
` re's work in the field of education, it is probably also important
to mention that his argument may not be first and foremost directed at a particular configuration
of the school, but rather that it is first and foremost a critique of society in so far as it operates on a
particular logic of schooling ­ a thesis discussed in more detail in Bingham and Biesta (2010),
particularly the concluding chapter, `The world is not a school'.
14. One way in which this `intervention' can be enacted, as I have shown, is `negative', that is by
denying the student the alleged satisfaction of their inability to think and know for themselves. But
there is also a more `positive' enactment of this emancipatory gesture, which is where teachers
approach students as subjects even if all the `evidence' suggests the opposite. On this dynamic, see
Biesta, 2015.
15. See also chapter 1 in Lewis (2012), which provides a compelling account of the differences and
similarities between Rancie
` re and Althusser.
16. I agree with a comment made by one of the reviewers of this manuscript that the question of
educational emancipation is to be distinguished from the question of emancipation in the context
of art. After all, we should not automatically assume that art is educational, or that education is
`artistic'. I use the word `artistic' in order to distinguish the argument here from the discussion
about the aesthetics of education, about which Lewis (2012) has provided a highly original and, to
a large degree, compelling argument. The reason for raising the issue of the relationship between
art and education in my argument is because Rancie
` re himself draws the two closely together in
The Emancipated Spectator.
17. The `stronger' version of this line of thought argues that teachers ought not give anything to their
students, as doing so would limit their freedom, which is the mistake upon which extreme forms of
child-centred education are based.
