A growing number of studies have recently sought to deter-
mine how a candidate's gender affects his or her decision to
enter politics, and how well-prepared he or she is for the
campaign. Women face stereotypes and double standards in
media coverage of their candidacies, but there is little evi-
dence that, in the aggregate, women perform worse than
men in terms of either fundraising or vote totals. One poten-
tial reason for the apparent gender parity in these areas is
that women wait for races in which they stand a good chance
of winning, and demonstrate higher average "quality" as
candidates, which allows them to outpace any gender-
related disadvantages they may face (Fulton, 2012, 2014).
In this article, I engage the related question of whether
women devote more of their personal time to their cam-
paigns than men and whether they set aside other obliga-
tions to do so. I find that women do indeed devote more of
their personal time to the campaign effort, largely because
they work less at non-campaign jobs during the election.
Gender and campaign effort
Both prospective candidates (Lawless and Fox, 2010) and
the public at large (Dowling and Miller, 2015) view women
candidates as disadvantaged relative to men, and women are
less likely to see themselves as well-qualified to run for
office (Lawless and Fox, 2010). The widely held perception
that women fare worse as candidates fuels a wide gulf
between the two genders in terms of political ambition,
which in turn results in fewer women entering politics
(Fulton et al., 2006; Lawless and Fox, 2010). Yet despite
conventional wisdom about the electoral prospects of
women candidates, once incumbency is accounted for the
women who do enter races raise as much or more money
than men (Burrell, 2008), and non-incumbent women not
only perform on par with men in terms of vote percentage
(Dolan, 2004; Smith and Fox, 2001), but also report win-
ning races for state and local offices at rates similar to men
(Lawless and Fox, 2010). It is certainly possible that men
and women perform equally well because the latter do not
face gender-related disadvantages as candidates. However,
there is a robust literature suggesting that women face dou-
ble standards in media coverage (Carroll and Dittmar, 2010;
Falk, 2008; Fowler and Lawless, 2009; Fox, 1997; Kahn,
1996). Voters apply stereotypes as well, viewing women as
more liberal (Koch, 2000, 2002), more compassionate, and
better-suited to the policy arena of "women's issues" such as
abortion or child care (see Burrell, 2008; Herrnson et al.,
Going all-in: gender and campaign
commitment

Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that women overcome the potential negative impact of gender stereotypes by emerging
when they are stronger candidates than men. I leverage an original survey of state legislative candidates to determine
whether women devote more time to their campaigns. I find that women on the whole, and those who had previously
been elected to a political office in particular, invested more of their personal time into the campaign than men. This
difference is driven by the fact that women are more likely to forgo employment during the election. These findings
suggest that women are more likely than men to arrange their personal obligations in such a fashion that they can run
stronger campaigns.

Stereotypes about women's policy competence do appear to
affect how voters evaluate them (Dolan, 2010), and Koch
(2002) found that voters' judgment of women candidates as
more liberal can make them appear to be farther from the
voter's ideal point than they actually are.
There is an emerging explanation for why, if women
candidates do face gender-related disadvantages, they still
perform comparably to men in the aggregate. For instance,
despite the gender gap in ambition, women looking to move
from the state legislature to Congress display more strate-
gic behavior than men, entering races when political condi-
tions are especially conducive to their candidacies (Fulton
et al., 2006). Women might be so calculating out of a belief
that they must be exceptionally well-prepared if they are to
overcome the perceived gender-based disadvantage. The
result is that among the candidates who actually begin a
campaign, women enjoy an advantage in average candidate
quality, which leads to aggregate gender parity with men on
observable outcomes such as vote totals or money raised
Fulton (2012, 2014). Put another way, women attempt to
overcome the negative effects of stereotypes by being bet-
ter candidates.
One heretofore unexamined aspect of "being better" is
whether women devote more of their personal time to legis-
lative campaigns. I engage a simple question: Do women
candidates spend more time on their campaign than men?
Since candidates' personal effort pays dividends for chal-
lengers in terms of votes (Miller, 2016), it stands to reason
that the strongest candidates will be those willing to commit
more of their time to the campaign. This is particularly true
in state legislative elections, which compared with the more
professionalized, media-driven environment of a congres-
sional campaign are more likely to require personal effort on
the part of the candidate, such as field canvassing or phon-
ing (Hogan, 1997). Candidates looking to wage a high-qual-
ity state legislative campaign should therefore be more
likely to wait for a time when they can fully commit to the
race. Thus, if women believe they must out-work their male
counterparts, they should be more likely to relinquish non-
campaign obligations such as outside employment, and
should invest more of their personal time in the campaign
relative to men. Given the observed strategic behavior of
"quality" women candidates, this effect should be especially
acute among women who have previously been elected to a
public office, such as school board or city council.
Data and method
I employ original survey data from the major-party, lower-
house candidate populations in 18 states during the 2008 gen-
eral election. Initial contact was made in early October, with
collection ceasing in early December. The included states are:
Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,
Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New
Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin. These states are geographically diverse and range
in ranking of Squire's (2007) index of legislative profession-
alization from third (Wisconsin) to forty-third (Maine),
accounting for a broad range of conditions in which state leg-
islative campaigns are conducted. The survey was deployed
in several waves via three media: mailed instruments, an elec-
tronic interface, and telephone. Of 2,971 candidates in the
population, the survey yielded 1,022 responses overall, for a
response rate of 34.4%, which is consistent with previous sur-
veys of candidate populations (Francia and Herrnson, 2003;
Howell, 1982). I retain survey data from candidates who
faced major-party opposition and who responded to the rele-
vant behavioral questions. There were 820 such candidates in
the sample, of which 273 were incumbent members of their
respective state houses. I supplement the survey data with
information about each candidate's vote totals and fundrais-
ing performance, obtained from the appropriate regulatory
agencies of each state. The survey instrument and sample
information can be found in Miller (2014).
Respondents were asked a series of questions about their
demographics, attitudes, and political experience, but two
measures are particularly important to the present analysis.
First, respondents entered the number of hours that they
personally devoted to a number of activities "during the
first week of October". Specifically, candidates quantified
the number of hours they spent on fundraising, public
speeches, field activity, electronic campaigning, media
relations, research, strategy, phoning voters, sending mail-
ings, and the courting of interest groups.1 The bulk of my
analysis compiles these activities into additive indices of
either "total time", reflecting the total number of weekly
hours that candidates reported personally devoting to their
campaign, or separates time into fundraising, field activi-
ties, and all other activities (see Miller, 2014, 2016).
I also asked candidates to categorize their occupational
status (outside of legislative responsibilities) during the
campaign as "not working", "employed part-time", or
"employed full-time".2 Candidates are grouped into catego-
ries based on their answer to this question, via indicator
variables for whether the candidate was in a given work
category. Similarly, candidates are placed into three "expe-
rience" categories: Incumbents, candidates who have previ-
ously been elected to a political office, and those with no
prior office-holding experience. In tandem, the measures of
the candidates' weekly hours and his/her responsibilities
outside of the campaign yield insight into the extent to
which the candidate was committed to the race on a daily
basis, and as political experience has been often-utilized as
a shortcut measure of candidate quality (Jacobson, 1989;
Van Dunk, 1997), it seems prudent to account for experi-
ence in the analysis of campaign commitment.
To gauge whether women spent more time campaigning,
I employ negative binomial models in which the (rounded)
number of hours that a candidate reported devoting to the
Miller 3
campaign serve as the dependent variable.3 Likewise, I uti-
lize logistic regression models of the binary outcome of
whether a candidate was in a particular work category. The
independent variable of interest in all models is an indicator
coded 1 if the candidate was a woman. I show at least two
specifications of each model: a binary regression of the
dependent variable on the gender indicator, as well as a
multivariate specification with theoretically relevant con-
trols. All multivariate models also include state fixed
effects. In the logistic regression models of whether a can-
didate was in a particular work category, I also include mul-
tiplicative interaction terms to test for the possibility that
either experience or incumbency moderates the relation-
ship between gender and propensity to work.
Throughout, I employ the political experience catego-
ries as a control variable. Where relevant for a given model,
I include as controls indicators for the candidate's political
party, self-identified race, and whether the election was for
an open seat or occurred in a multi-member district. I also
include observed characteristics of the legislative district,
such as the percentage of the two-party general election
vote that the candidate's party had received in the previous
(2006) general election, as well as others obtained from
Lilley et al. (2007), such as urbanity, (logged) population,
and (logged) household income.
Results
I first consider the amount of time that candidates reported
devoting to their campaign, by their level of experience.
Figure 1 depicts the mean number of hours that candidates
spent on fundraising, "field" activities such as canvassing
or sign-posting, and all other campaign activities.4 Within
every experience category, women reported spending more
weekly hours on their campaign than men. The difference
is substantively small among inexperienced candidates,
where women outworked men 48.6 hours to 47.0 hours.
Incumbent women, however, devoted 47.2 hours to their
campaign: exactly 5 hours more than incumbent men. An
even larger gap is evident among experienced challengers.
Non-incumbent women with political experience spent
47.9 hours on their campaign on average. This figure is
higher than any other candidate category, and is over 7
hours more than experienced men devoted to their cam-
paigns. Figure 1 is therefore consistent with the notion that
women who entered a state legislative campaign did so
strategically, investing more time in the effort than men
with similar backgrounds.
Table 1 contains negative binomial regression coeffi-
cients for models which explore the relationship between
gender and campaign time in greater detail.5 The dependent
variable in these models is the (rounded) number of weekly
hours that the candidate reported spending on the cam-
paign. Given the results depicted in Figure 1 above, Model
5 unsurprisingly returns a positive, statistically significant
coefficient for the variable indicating the candidate is a
woman, suggesting that among experienced candidates,
women devote more of their personal time to the campaign.
The same is true in Model 1, which employs data from all
candidates.
However, both models capture only the bivariate rela-
tionship between gender and effort. When the appropriate
controls are included in the even-numbered models, the
coefficient for the female indicator becomes substantively
smaller, and in no case achieves statistical significance.
That said, the predicted number of hours spent on the cam-
paign from the even-numbered models in Table 1 closely
mirrors the pattern observed in Figure 1. When the other
variables are held at their mean levels for each gender,
inexperienced women are predicted to spend about 48
hours on the campaign: about 2 hours more than inexperi-
enced men. The difference is much higher for experienced
women, who outwork their male counterparts by a margin
of 53 to 45.5, while the predicted 47 hours spent by incum-
bent women is about 5.5 more than male incumbents.
Taken together, the models in Table 1 suggest that
women devote more time to their campaigns, possibly
because they are less likely than their male peers to work
during the campaign. Such a relationship would be consist-
ent with the idea that women feel a greater need to eschew
other obligations so they can focus on running a strong
race. Figure 2 depicts the percentage of candidates, by gen-
der and experience, who worked either full-time or part-
time, or who did not work during the campaign, and
demonstrates that regardless of their experience level, men
were more likely to report working full-time than women.
Indeed, a majority of non-incumbent men worked full-time
during the election, while a majority of women in all three
candidate groupings worked less than full-time. As with the
analysis of campaign time, the largest gap between men
and women appears among candidates with political expe-
rience: While more than 60% of experienced men worked

experience and gender.
4 Research and Politics 
full-time, only 27% of women with political experience
did, and experienced women were almost twice as likely as
experienced men to not work at all during the race.
It is worth noting that Figure 2 is also consistent with the
notion that experienced women opt out of work by strategic
calculus. If women were more likely than men to not work
by virtue of unobserved factors such as family structure or
wealth, the rates of non-work should be comparable for
women across experience categories. However, women
with political experience were almost twice as likely as
inexperienced women to not work at all during the cam-
paign. This stark difference implies that the propensity to
focus on the election is not driven solely by gender; rather,
it is consistent with the premise that "high-quality" women
candidates choose to put other obligations aside during the
campaign.

models of two dependent variables: whether the candidate

did not work at all, and whether the candidate worked less
than full-time. All four additive models are suggestive that
women are significantly more likely to either not work or to
work less than full-time. Models 11 and 14 include interac-
tion effects intended to test whether political experience
moderates the apparent relationship between gender and
work status. One of the two interaction terms is significant
in each model, suggesting that political experience is indeed
a moderating force.
To aid in interpretation, I now turn to Figure 3, which
depicts the predicted probabilities of not working obtained
from Model 11 (left pane), and the predicted probabilities
of working less than full-time obtained from Model 14
(right pane) for candidates of both genders and all three
experience levels. In addition to the point estimate of the
predicted probability, Figure 3 also depicts 90% confidence
intervals. The predicted probability of not working (left
pane) is higher for women than men at all three experience
levels. However, the difference is substantively meaning-
less for inexperienced candidates, and the confidence inter-
vals for incumbent women and men display substantial
overlap. The space between women and men is larger,
about 18 points, for experienced candidates, indicating
once again that the probability that an experienced woman
chooses not to work is significantly higher than it is for
experienced men.

6 Research and Politics 
A similar pattern is evident in the right pane, which
depicts the predicted probability of working less than full-
time. Again, women appear more probable than men to
work less than full-time at each experience level. Moreover,
while the gap is substantively small for incumbents, it is
large for both experienced and inexperienced challengers.
Indeed, the predicted probability of working less than full-
time is roughly 21 and 35 points higher for inexperienced
and experienced women, respectively, relative to men.
Taken together, my analysis is therefore strongly sugges-
tive that women with political experience devote more
effort to their campaigns than men on a weekly basis
because they are also more likely to forgo employment dur-
ing the election.
Discussion/conclusion
Previous research has argued that women overcome gen-
der-related disadvantages by being better candidates. I
engage a related but open question: Do women candidates
expend more effort on their campaign? I find that women
candidates devote more time to their campaign because
they are more likely to forgo working at a job during the
election. In tandem with existing work (namely, Fulton
2012), these findings provide further evidence that women
believe that in order to win, they must be better candidates
than men. My results suggest that this belief is especially
strong for women who have previously held elected office.
While the survey data do not support definitive conclusions
about why experienced women are particularly likely to
invest more of their time in the campaign, my findings are
consistent with the notion of a more strategic "quality"
woman candidate who enters a race under favorable condi-
tions and works hard to affect the desired result (see Fulton
et al., 2006). Eschewing full-time work may just be another
symptom of women being particularly good at "picking
their spot". That said, further research should more fully
examine the strategic considerations of women entering
political races, and experienced women in particular.
My analysis is not without limitations. One potential
issue is the reliability and/or internal validity of self-reported
campaign time, which serves as a dependent variable for a
portion of my analysis. Although retrospective self-report-
ing of work time has been demonstrated to be fairly accurate
(Jacobs, 1998), it is possible that candidates might have
inflated the number of hours they reported devoting to their
campaign, since doing so would make them appear to be
more "hard-working". Fortunately, such an inflation, assum-
ing that it occurred in a relatively uniform fashion, would
affect only the intercept in a regression equation, and would
bias neither the coefficients nor the standard errors in the
models reported above. Moreover, the mean level of self-
reported weekly campaign time was about 47 hours, which
seems plausible in a contested state legislative election. As
such, there is no obvious reason to doubt the results of my
analysis on the basis of self-reported time alone.
It is also possible that rather than eschewing work stra-
tegically in order to campaign harder, women are simply
less likely to have work obligations to begin with. The fact
that experienced women displayed such aberrant behavior
relative to women who lacked political experience, how-
ever, is not consistent with this narrative. If time flexibility
drives the entry decision, then it seems reasonable to expect
both inexperienced and experienced women to exhibit
higher (relative to men) rates of sub-full-time employment.
However, only women with political experience, who
should be most likely to make strategic decisions about the
campaign, display higher rates of non-employment than
men. So while it is possible that causation flows in the
opposite direction, I believe it is unlikely given the data
presented above. Future work could directly engage the
strategic considerations that women make before they enter
the race, perhaps by soliciting responses about income,
wealth, or family structure.
