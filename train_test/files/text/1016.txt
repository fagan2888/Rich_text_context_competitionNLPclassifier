Background: Dramatic changes have occurred in men-
tal health treatments during the past decade. Data on re-
cent treatment patterns are needed to estimate the un-
met need for services.
Objective: To provide data on patterns and predictors
of 12-month mental health treatment in the United States
from the recently completed National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication.
Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-
to-face household survey using a fully structured diag-
nostic interview, the World Health Organization's World
Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview, carried out be-
tween February 5, 2001, and April 7, 2003.
Participants: A total of 9282 English-speaking respon-
dents 18 years and older.
Main Outcome Measures: Proportions of respon-
dents with 12-month DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse con-
trol, and substance disorders who received treatment in
the 12 months before the interview in any of 4 service sec-
tors (specialty mental health, general medical, human ser-
vices,andcomplementaryandalternativemedicine).Num-
ber of visits and proportion of patients who received
minimally adequate treatment were also assessed.
Results: Of 12-month cases, 41.1% received some treat-
ment in the past 12 months, including 12.3% treated by a
psychiatrist, 16.0% treated by a nonpsychiatrist mental
health specialist, 22.8% treated by a general medical pro-
vider, 8.1% treated by a human services provider, and 6.8%
treated by a complementary and alternative medical pro-
vider (treatment could be received by 1 source). Over-
all, cases treated in the mental health specialty sector re-
ceived more visits (median, 7.4) than those treated in the
general medical sector (median, 1.7). More patients in spe-
cialty than general medical treatment also received treat-
ment that exceeded a minimal threshold of adequacy
(48.3% vs 12.7%). Unmet need for treatment is greatest
in traditionally underserved groups, including elderly per-
sons,racial-ethnicminorities,thosewithlowincomes,those
without insurance, and residents of rural areas.
Conclusions: Most people with mental disorders in the
United States remain either untreated or poorly treated.
Interventions are needed to enhance treatment initia-
tion and quality.

The present report provides basic descriptive data from
the recently completed NCS Replication (NCS-R).35 We
first examine the proportions of respondents with 12-
month disorders who obtain any treatment in the 12
months before interview, by disorder and service sec-
tor. Because the intensity and quality of treatment have
often been poor in earlier studies,36-38 we also examine
median numbers of visits and proportions receiving mini-
mally adequate treatment concordant with evidence-
based guidelines. Finally, we examine sociodemo-
graphic correlates of treatment and treatment adequacy.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey of
respondents 18 years and older in the coterminous United
States.39,40 Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 9282 re-
spondents between February 5, 2001, and April 7, 2003. Part 1
included a core diagnostic assessment administered to all re-
spondents. Part 2 assessed risk factors, correlates, service use,
and additional disorders, and was administered to all part 1 re-
spondents with lifetime disorders plus a probability subsample
of other respondents. The overall response rate was 70.9%. The
NCS-R recruitment, consent, and field procedures were ap-
proved by the Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical
School and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
of 12-Month Mental Disorders
DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the World Health Organi-
zation's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative version
of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),41 a
fully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that gen-
erates International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-
10),42 and DSM-IV43 diagnoses. Twelve-month DSM-IV disor-
ders considered herein include mood (bipolar I and II disorders,
major depressive disorder, and dysthymia), anxiety (panic dis-
order, agoraphobia without panic, specific phobia, social pho-
bia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disor-
der, posttraumatic stress disorder, and separation anxiety
disorder), impulse control (intermittent explosive disorder), and
substance (alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence) dis-
orders. All diagnoses are considered with organic exclusions and
diagnostic hierarchy rules, with the exception of the substance
disorders, for which abuse is defined with or without depen-
dence. Blind clinical reappraisals using the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV39,44 showed generally good concordance
between WMH CIDI lifetime diagnoses and the Structured Clini-
cal Interview for DSM-IV for anxiety, mood, and substance dis-
orders. The WMH CIDI lifetime diagnoses of impulse control
disorders have not been validated, and evaluation of WMH CIDI
12-month diagnoses is ongoing.
Twelve-Month Use of Mental Health Services
All part 2 respondents were asked whether they ever received
treatment for "problems with your emotions or nerves or your
use of alcohol or drugs." A list of types of treatment providers
was presented in a respondent booklet to provide a visual recall
aid. The list of professionals included was as follows: a psychia-
trist, a general practitioner or family physician, any other phy-
sician(eg,cardiologist,gynecologist,orurologist),asocialworker,
a counselor, any other mental health professional (eg, a psycho-
therapist or a mental health nurse), a religious or spiritual ad-
visor (eg, a minister, priest, or rabbi), or any other healer (eg, a
chiropractor, herbalist, or spiritualist). Separate assessments were
made for different types of professionals, support groups, self-
help groups, mental health crisis hotlines (assumed to be visits
with nonpsychiatrist mental health specialists), CAM thera-
pies, and use of other treatment settings, including admissions
to hospitals and other facilities (each day of admission was as-
sumed to include a visit with a psychiatrist). Follow-up ques-
tions asked about age at first and most recent contacts and num-
ber and duration of visits in the past 12 months.
Reports of 12-month service use were classified into the fol-
lowingcategories:psychiatrist,nonpsychiatristmentalhealthspe-
cialist (psychologist or other nonpsychiatrist mental health pro-
fessionalinanysetting,socialworkerorcounselorinamentalhealth
specialty [MHS] setting, or use of a mental health hotline), gen-
eral medical (GM) provider (primary care physician, other gen-
eralphysician,nurse,oranyotherhealthcareprofessionalnotpre-
viouslymentioned),humanservices(HS)professional(religious
or spiritual advisor or social worker or counselor in any setting
otherthanaspecialtymentalhealthsetting),andCAMprofessional
(any other type of healer, such as a chiropractor, participation in
an Internet support group, or participation in a self-help group).
Psychiatrist and nonpsychiatrist specialist categories were com-
binedintoabroaderMHScategory;MHSwasalsocombinedwith
GMintoanevenbroaderHCcategory.HumanservicesandCAM
were also combined into a non-HC category.
Minimally Adequate Treatment
Minimally adequate treatment was defined based on available
evidence-based guidelines24-29 as receiving either pharmaco-
therapy (2 months of an appropriate medication for the fo-
cal disorder plus 4 visits to any type of physician) or psy-
chotherapy (8 visits with any HC or HS professional lasting
an average of 30 minutes). The decision to require 4 or more
physician visits for pharmacotherapy was based on the fact that
4 or more visits for medication evaluation, initiation, and moni-
toring are generally recommended during the acute and con-
tinuation phases of treatment in available guidelines.20-25 Ap-
propriate medications for disorders included antidepressants
for depressive disorders, mood stabilizers or antipsychotic agents
for bipolar disorders, antidepressants or anxiolytic agents for
anxiety disorders, antagonists or agonists (disulfiram, naltrex-

one, or methadone hydrochloride) for alcohol and other sub-
stance disorders, and any psychiatric drug for impulse control
disorders.9 At least 8 sessions were required for minimally ad-
equate psychotherapy based on the fact that clinical trials dem-
onstrating effectiveness have generally included 8 psycho-
therapy visits or more.20-25 For alcohol and other substance
disorders, self-help visits of any duration were counted as psy-
chotherapy visits. Treatment adequacy was defined separately
for each 12-month disorder (ie, a respondent with comorbid
disorders could be classified as receiving minimally adequate
treatment for one disorder but not for another).
Respondents who began treatments shortly before the NCS-R
interview may not have had time to fulfill requirements, even
though they were in the early stages of adequate treatment. Fur-
thermore, brief treatments have been developed for certain dis-
orders.45,46 We, therefore, created a broader definition of mini-
mally adequate treatment for sensitivity analyses that consisted
of receiving 2 or more visits to an appropriate treatment sector
(1 visit for a presumptive examination/diagnosis and 1 visit
for treatment) or being in ongoing treatment at interview.
Sociodemographic Predictor Variables
Sociodemographic variables included cohort (defined by age
at interview and categorized as 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60
years), sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, and other), completed years of education
(0-11, 12, 13-15, and 16), marital status (married-
cohabitating, previously married, and never married), family
income in relation to the federal poverty line47 (categorized as
low [1.5 times the poverty line], low average [1.5-3 times
the poverty line], high average [3-6 times the poverty line],
and high [6 times the poverty line]), urbanicity defined ac-
cording to 2000 census definitions48 (large and smaller metro-
politan areas; central cities, suburbs, and adjacent areas; and
rural areas), and health insurance coverage (including pri-
vate, public, or military sources).
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
The NCS-R data were weighted to adjust for differences in prob-
abilities of selection, differential nonresponse, residual differ-
ences between the sample and the US population, and over-
sampling in the part 2 sample.39 Basic patterns of service use
were examined by computing proportions in treatment, mean
and median numbers of visits among those in treatment, and
probabilities of treatments meeting the criteria for minimal ad-
equacy. Logistic regression49 analysis was used to study socio-
demographic predictors of receiving any 12-month treatment
in the total sample, treatment in particular sectors among those
receiving any treatment, and treatment meeting the criteria for
minimal adequacy. Standard errors were estimated using the
Taylor series method as implemented in a computer software
program (SUDAAN).50 Multivariate significance tests in the lo-
gistic regression analyses were made using Wald 2 tests based
on coefficient varianceÂ­covariance matrices that were ad-
justed for design effects using the Taylor series method. Sta-
tistical significance was evaluated using 2-sided design-based
tests and the .05 level of significance.
RESULTS
PROBABILITY OF 12-MONTH SERVICE USE
Of the respondents, 17.9% used services in the prior year,
including 41.1% of those with 12-month DSM-IV disor-
ders and 10.1% of those without them (Table 1) (Kessler
et al51 describe the prevalence of 12-month disorders in the
NCS-R). The proportion of cases in treatment ranged from
a high for dysthymia to a low for intermittent explosive dis-
order. Most treatments occurred in the HC sectors (15.3%
of respondents, representing 85.5% of those in treatment)
and, within the HC sectors, the GM sector (9.3% of re-
spondents, representing 52.0% of those in treatment).
NUMBER OF VISITS
The median number of 12-month visits (Table 2) among
those receiving any treatment was 2.9, and was signifi-
cantlyhigheramongthosewithdisordersthanamongthose
without disorders (z=5.8, P.001). Because respon-
dents with no disorder make up most of the population
(74.6%), they account for nearly one third of all visits
(33.2%) and visits to specific sectors. Within-sector me-
dians ranged from a high for CAM to a low for GM.
The mean numbers of visits (data not shown, but avail-
able from the authors) are consistently much higher than
the median. For example, the median among patients re-
ceiving any treatment was 2.9, compared with the mean
of 14.7. Mean visits were significantly higher among pa-
tients with a disorder (16.9) than among those without a
disorder(11.6)(z=3.1,P=.001).Within-sectormeanswere
highestforCAM(29.8)andnonpsychiatristspecialty(16.1),
lower for psychiatrist (7.5) and HS (7.1), and lowest for
GM (2.6). Based on these data, the proportion of all visits
madeinspecificsectorswashighestfornonpsychiatristspe-
cialty (38.0%) and CAM (31.3%), lower for psychiatrist
(12.6%), and lowest for GM (9.1%) and HS (9.0%).
The greater magnitude of means than medians implies
thatcomparativelyfewpatientsreceiveadisproportionately
high share of all visits (Table 3). For example, although
nearly60%ofpatientsseenbypsychiatristsmadefewerthan
5 visits in the year, they accounted for only one sixth of all
visits to psychiatrists. Those making 50 or more visits to
psychiatrists in the year, while representing only 1.6% of
all patients seen by psychiatrists, accounted for 20.2% of
all psychiatrist visits. One way to compare these distribu-
tionsacrosssectorsistocalculatetheproportionofpatients
attheupperendoftheserviceusedistributionwhoaccount
for50%ofallvisitstothesector.Thispercentageisbetween
6.4% (HS) and 23.6% (GM) of patients across sectors.
MINIMALLY ADEQUATE TREATMENT
Of the treated patients with disorders, only 32.7% were
classified as receiving at least minimally adequate treat-
ment (Table 4). Probabilities of treatment being at least
minimally adequate were highest in the MHS sectors and
lowest in the GM sector.
In sensitivity analyses (data not shown, but available
from the authors) using the broader definition of mini-
mally adequate treatment (ie, receiving 2 visits to an ap-
propriate sector or being in ongoing treatment at the time
of interview), the percentage of patients receiving treat-
ment that was at least minimally adequate increased to
47.8%.Probabilitieswerehighestinthepsychiatrist(53.3%)
and nonpsychiatrist specialty (51.1%) sectors, and lower
in the HS (46.9%) and GM (33.2%) sectors.

graphic correlates of treatment adequacy in the GM sec-
tor. Correlates of adequate MHS treatment include a high
level of education and living in a rural area. Finally, the
adequacy of non-HC treatment seems to be highest among
patients aged 18 to 29 years, males, and those married.
COMMENT
These results should be interpreted with the following
5 limitations in mind. First, the NCS-R excludes people
whoarehomelessorinstitutionalized.Becausethesepeople
make up only a small proportion of the population, these
results apply to most of the population. Another frame ex-
clusion is that the WMH CIDI did not assess all DSM-IV
disorders. Therefore, some respondents in treatment clas-

sified as not having a disorder may actually have met the
criteria for a DSM-IV disorder not assessed.
Second, systematic survey nonresponse (ie, people with
mental disorders having a higher survey refusal rate than
those without disorders) or systematic nonreporting (ie,
recall failure, conscious nonreporting, or error in the di-
agnostic evaluation) could lead to bias in the estimates
of unmet need for treatment. Given what we know about
the associations between true prevalence and these er-
rors,39,40,52-55 it is likely that unmet need for treatment has
been underestimated.
Third, without corroborating data on service use, we
cannot study the validity of self-reported treatment use
in the NCS-R. Recent studies56,57 of the Ontario Health
Survey suggest that self-reports of mental health service
use overestimate administrative treatment records, es-
pecially concerning the number of visits and among re-
spondents with more distressing disorders. Unlike the
Ontario Health Survey, the NCS-R did attempt to mini-
mize such inaccuracies by using commitment probes (ie,
questions designed to measure a subject's commitment
to the survey) and excluding the few respondents (1%)
who failed to endorse that they would think carefully and
answer honestly. Nevertheless, potentially biased recall
of mental health service use remains a limitation. To the
extent that it occurred, our results are likely to under-
estimate unmet need for treatment, especially among those
with more serious disorders.
Fourth, our definitions of minimally adequate treat-

edge, their relationships with important clinical out-

treatments have also been described for certain phobias45

using broader definitions (ie, 2 visits to an appropriate
sector or being in ongoing treatment at the time of inter-
view) accounted for these possibilities and still found that
half of treated cases are cared for inadequately.
Fifth, no effort was made to determine the need for
treatment based on the severity of disorders. It is pos-
sible that respondents with untreated or inadequately
treated disorders are disproportionately made up of mild
or self-limiting cases. An evaluation of the relationship
between disorder severity and treatment adequacy is an

important next step in the analysis of the NCS-R data,
but goes beyond the scope of this initial report.
With these limitations in mind, the results reported
herein document serious problems in the treatment of
people with mental disorders in the United States. In-
creasing use of some modalities, most notably pharma-
cotherapies and physician-administered psychothera-
pies,7,36,58,59 has generated hope that mental disorders are
being treated much more effectively than in the past. Our
results suggest that such optimism is premature. Mental
health service use remains disturbingly low, with most
patients not receiving any care in the prior year. Among
the minority who receive services, not all are treated in
a HC sector. Even those who successfully access the HC
sector often fail to get sufficient visits for clinical assess-
ments, delivery of treatments, and appropriate ongoing
monitoring.29,58,60 Furthermore, only one third of treat-
ments meet minimal standards of adequacy based on evi-
dence-based treatment guidelines,20-25 confirming re-
sults of earlier studies.36-38,61
The frequent use of treatments with uncertain benefit
is striking. This is especially worrisome for CAM treat-
ments, which account for 31.3% of all mental health vis-
its despite a paucity of data supporting their effi-
cacy.11-13,62-65 A challenge for the providers of conventional
services is to determine why CAM has such great appeal
and whether legitimate aspects related to this appeal (eg,
a greater orientation to patient-centered care) can be
adopted by conventional mental HC providers to in-
crease the attractiveness of evidence-based treatments.
Conversely, many services are being consumed by re-
spondents without apparent disorders. Although respon-
dents without disorders are less likely to receive treat-
ment or as many visits once in treatment as those with
disorders, they make up such a majority of the popula-
tion that they account for nearly one third of all visits.
Some services are undoubtedly being used appropri-
ately to treat active mental disorders not assessed in the
NCS-R, to treat subthreshold symptoms, as secondary pre-
vention of lifetime disorders, or even as primary preven-
tion of disorders.66 However, given the profound unmet
need for mental health services among people with well-
defined mental disorders, the potential diversion of so
many treatment resources to individuals without men-
tal disorders is concerning.67
The highly skewed distribution of visits, in which a
few patients account for most visits, implies that more
people with disorders could be effectively treated with
existing levels of resources through better allocation. It
is less clear, though, how to develop a principled basis
for deciding what the optimal allocation of treatment re-
sources should be or how the organization and financ-
ing of services would have to be modified to achieve it.
Some features of managed care, such as prior authoriza-
tion and utilization review, could presumably be ap-
plied to unnecessary use but not underuse--in fact, ap-
plication of such features may have an unintended
consequence of worsening unmet needs for treatments.
Furthermore, it is not clear how any optimal allocation
plan that is developed would be implemented in the de-
centralized US HC system, as this remains a formidable
task even in centralized HC systems.68
The proportion of NCS-R respondents who reported
12-month mental health service use (17.9%) is higher than
the value found a decade earlier in the baseline NCS
(13.3%)6 and the value found a decade before that in the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study (12.3%).69 By far,
the greatest part of this expansion occurred in the GM
sector. General physicians often act as gatekeepers re-
sponsible for initiating mental health treatments them-
selves and for deciding whom to triage for specialty
care.70,71 Increasing awareness of mental disorders on the
part of primary care physicians, coupled with an in-
crease in consumer demand stimulated by direct-to-

consumer advertising, has probably also played a role in
this growth.72-75 However, the fact that only a few pa-
tients treated in the GM sector receive minimally ad-
equate care makes these trends concerning. Reasons for
the low rate of treatment adequacy are unclear, but pre-
sumably involve provider factors (eg, competing de-
mands, inadequate reimbursements for treating mental
disorders, and less training and experience in treating
mental disorders) and patient factors (eg, worse compli-
ance with treatments than in MHS sectors).18,19,76,77
Service use also varied across disorders. The greater
treatment for panic disorder than specific phobia or for
substance dependence than substance abuse presum-
ably reflects the influence of greater distress and im-
pairment on help seeking.78-82 The generally lower treat-
ment rates for externalizing disorders (eg, substance
disorders and intermittent explosive disorder) may re-
flect diminished perceived needs for treatment on the
part of patients and tendencies for patients and provid-
ers to view these problems as social or criminal rather
than medical.83,84 In the case of impulse control disor-
ders, an additional issue is that effective treatments are
just emerging.85,86
The NCS-R results concerning sociodemographic
predictors of mental health service use are generally
consistent with prior research in showing that vulner-
able groups often have elevated risks of undertreat-
ment. The lower overall rate of treatment among older
people may be due to the greater perceived stigma of
mental disorders among people in this age range.81 The
fact that among those receiving HC older respondents
are less likely to obtain it in specialty settings may like-
wise reflect the unacceptability of mental health treat-
ments to elderly persons.87,88
The lower rate of treatment among men is consistent
with most previous research6,69 and is potentially ex-
plained by greater perceived stigma and women's
greater abilities to translate nonspecific feelings of dis-
tress into conscious recognition of having a mental
health problem.89,90 The fact that male patients are more
likely than female patients to use MHS care may be due
to primary care physicians' greater willingness to treat
women, while referring men to specialists.91,92 What-
ever the cause, it results in male patients having a con-
siderably higher probability of receiving adequate treat-
ment than female patients.

The lower overall rate of treatment among racial and
ethnic minorities is generally consistent with prior re-
search.93 On the other hand, among people who re-
ceived treatment, there were no significant associations
between race-ethnicity and treatment adequacy. These
patterns, at least superficially, point to the importance
of barriers on the part of potential patients to accessing
HC rather than inadequacies in the quality of care once
patients enroll in treatment. Recent studies in minority
communities94 document that experiences and expecta-
tions of mistreatment due to prejudice may still be key
factors in discouraging early access to HC for mental dis-
orders.
Despite the absence of race-ethnicity differences in
treatment adequacy among patients, low education and
low income were associated with increased odds of not

some findings for the uninsured, given the lack of dem-
onstrated effectiveness for most non-HC treatments.62-64
Surprisingly, insurance was not related to receiving any
treatment or adequacy among people receiving treat-
ment. The effects of low income most likely reflect the for-
midable influences of financial barriers; because insur-
ance was controlled, these results imply that simply having
insurance may not be sufficient to overcome these ef-
fects.96 Interestingly, those with the lowest incomes were
associated with more treatment than those with low-
average incomes, perhaps because the near poor do not
qualify for often more generous entitlements for the in-
digent. Given our adjustment for income, the positive as-
sociation between education and MHS care may be be-
cause of more than education being a proxy for greater
financial resources to pay for specialty services; instead,
it may reflect an importance placed on knowledge and cog-
nitive processes in many psychotherapeutic modalities.96
Greater use of mental health services among those pre-
viously married may indicate the power of relationship
loss or strife as a motivator for seeking treatment.81 The
finding that the unmarried who seek HC are more likely
to obtain it in specialty settings may reflect that coun-
seling is often a preferred modality for those with rela-
tional difficulties. Finally, lower treatment in rural areas
probably reflects the scarcity of treatment resources, es-
pecially in the MHS sector; however, the limited MHS
care that does exist is superior.97
Three broad types of intervention are suggested by the
results. First, outreach efforts are needed to increase ac-
cess to and initiation of treatments. Interventions of this
type could include renewed community awareness and
screening programs, new means for financing mental
health services, and expansion of treatment resources for
underserved areas.14,15,30-32,97 Second, interventions are
needed to improve the quality of care delivered to pa-
tients with mental disorders. Several disease manage-
ment programs that enhance treatment adequacy and
adherence have already been proved successful and cost-
effective.26-28,98,99 Performance standards, such as those
in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration's Center for Mental Health Services Con-
sumer-Oriented Mental Health Report Card60 and those
of the National Committee for Quality Assurance,29 could
further optimize quality and monitor future interven-
tions' impacts. Third, initiatives are needed to increase
the uptake of successful programs and treatment mod-
els. Widespread failure to disseminate proved interven-
tions may, in fact, explain why large unmet needs per-
sist in the United States, despite earlier efforts to address
this problem. Substantial barriers to the uptake of effec-
tive interventions exist, including competing clinical de-
mands and distorted incentives for effectively treating
mental disorders faced by providers, particularly in pri-
mary care.18,19,76,77,100 Purchasers may also hesitate to take
up proved interventions because they lack metrics to help
understand what their return on investment will be.101
Ongoing initiatives seeking to overcome these barriers
include the Robert Wood Johnson Depression in Pri-
mary Care Program77 and the National Institute of Men-
tal HealthÂ­sponsored Work Outcomes Research and Cost-
effectiveness Study.101
