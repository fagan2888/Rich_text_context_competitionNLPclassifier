Abstract
The original version of this consensus statement on mechanical thrombectomy was approved at the European Stroke
Organisation (ESO)-Karolinska Stroke Update conference in Stockholm, 16­18 November 2014. The statement has
later, during 2015, been updated with new clinical trials data in accordance with a decision made at the conference.
Revisions have been made at a face-to-face meeting during the ESO Winter School in Berne in February, through email
exchanges and the final version has then been approved by each society. The recommendations are identical to the
original version with evidence level upgraded by 20 February 2015 and confirmed by 15 May 2015. The purpose of the
ESO-Karolinska Stroke Update meetings is to provide updates on recent stroke therapy research and to discuss how the
results may be implemented into clinical routine. Selected topics are discussed at consensus sessions, for which a
consensus statement is prepared and discussed by the participants at the meeting. The statements are advisory to
the ESO guidelines committee. This consensus statement includes recommendations on mechanical thrombectomy after

Received: 2 September 2015; accepted: 2 September 2015
Methods
The Karolinska Stroke Update (KSU) consensus con-
ferences take place every second year since 1996. From
2014, this is an official European Stroke Organisation
meeting (ESO-KSU). The ESO-KSU program commit-
tee approves the final program. The core of the pro-
gram is formed by consensus sessions, each dedicated to
a topic within clinical stroke research with recent study
results.
The participants in the consensus session prepare a
draft consensus statement, coordinated by the session
chairpersons and secretary. For the thrombectomy con-
sensus session 2014, the secretary performed a Pubmed
search for ``mechanical thrombectomy and stroke'',
``endovascular treatment of stroke'', ``neurointer-
vention'' and others, as a basis for the draft statement.
The draft circulated between the participants providing
additional information on literature reviews and new
publications. The draft was finally confirmed at a face-
to-face session the afternoon before the start of the
meeting and then discussed and modified at the meeting.
Since the participants at the Karolinska Stroke
Update conference 2014 were aware of that several ran-
domized studies on mechanical thrombectomy were
about to be published within the next few months, it
was decided that the session participants and the con-
ference secretariat should revise the statement when
relevant, based on the new reports. Since representa-
tives of several professional organizations participated
at the conference, the statement was also reviewed and
agreed upon by these organizations.
New evidence since Karolinska stroke
update 2012
Since the previous Karolinska stroke update consensus
statement on mechanical thrombectomy 2012 results
from randomized clinical trials and other retrospective
cohort studies were made available as follows:
Large meta-analysis from randomized clinical
trials of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)
A recently published meta-analysis of individual
patient data from 6756 patients in nine randomized
trials comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with
alteplase versus placebo or open control showed that
alteplase significantly improves functional outcomes
when delivered within 4­5 h of stroke onset, with
earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional
benefits (OR 1Á75, 95% CI 1Á35­2Á27), thus emphasiz-
ing the need for preventing delays in acute stroke
treatment.1
Clinical trials on mechanical thrombectomy
Older generation devices and first use of stent
retrievers. Three trials evaluating endovascular therapy,
published in 2013, IMS III, MR RESCUE and
SYNTHESIS, reported neutral results on clinical out-
come. Possible explanations for failure to demonstrate
superiority of endovascular therapy were long delay
between symptom onset and treatment, inadequate
patient selection, less than desired recanalization rates
and use of older generation devices. IMS III showed no
difference in safety and clinical outcomes compared to
IVT but used six different procedural techniques with
only four patients being treated with the new gener-
ation stent retrievers.2 A subgroup analysis of IMS
III showed that 48.2% of the patients were functionally
independent at follow-up, corresponding to a modified
Rankin score (mRS) 0­2 when recanalization to mod-
ified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score
2b/3 was achieved (for internal carotid artery (ICA)
occlusions 37­42% and proximal middle cerebral
artery (MCA) (M1) occlusions 44%),3 emphasizing
the importance of recanalization of proximal occlusion.
Importantly, IMS III demonstrated that a delay in time
to reperfusion was associated with lower likelihood of
good clinical outcome.4 MR RESCUE allowed proced-
ures up to 8 h based on penumbral imaging but used
previous generation MERCI or Penumbra devices
achieving mTICI 2b/3 recanalization rates of 67%.5
The SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trial also used very
few stent retrievers.6 However, regarding safety, these
trials showed similar rates of symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage (SICH) compared to IVT and even equiva-
lence/superiority of IVT for minor stroke and stroke
without large vessel occlusion on imaging.7
In the meantime, evidence for the efficacy and safety
of stent retrievers in mechanical thrombectomy contin-
ued to grow from non-randomized studies. The solitaire

flow restoration thrombectomy for acute revasculariza-
tion (STAR) study was an international, multicentre,
prospective, single-arm study of the SolitaireTM device
in 202 patients with large vessel occlusion of the anter-
ior circulation within 8 h of onset. It reported a 79%
rate of successful revascularization, 57.9% of mRS 0-2,
1.5% SICH and 6.9% mortality. Support for stent
retrievers was further gathered in a 2013 pooled ana-
lysis of 19 studies using the TrevoTM (n ¼ 221) or
SolitaireTM (n ¼ 355) devices, showing mTICI 2b-3
scores in 83 and 82%, hemorrhage in 8 and 6%,
device complications in 5 and 6%, good functional out-
comes in 51 and 47% of the patients with similar times
to recanalization and with a mortality of 31 and 14%,
respectively.8
Stent retrievers in recent randomized controlled trials. Two
smaller phase IIb randomized controlled studies com-
pared stent retrievers with the original MERCITM
device (see also thrombectomy consensus statement
from the 2012 KSU meeting):
The SWIFT study (SolitaireTM With the Intention
For Thrombectomy) compared thrombectomy with
the SolitaireTM and with the MERCITM devices and
was prematurely stopped after 113 patients because of
efficacy. The primary outcome, recanalisation defined
as Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) scale
2 or 3, was more frequent with the Solitaire TM device
with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.9 (95% CI 2.1­11.1). Also,
three months mRS 2 was more frequent with the
SolitaireTM with an OR of 2.8 (1.2­6.2).9
The TREVO-2 trial (Trevo versus Merci retrievers
for thrombectomy REvascularisation of large Vessel
Occlusions) compared thrombectomy with the
TREVO RetrieverTM and with the MERCITM device
in 178 patients. Reperfusion measured by thrombolysis
in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores of !2 was more
frequent with the TREVO retrieverTM with an OR of
4.2 (95% CI 1.9­9.7). Three months mRS 2 was more
frequent with TrevoTM: 40.0% vs. 21.8%, but there was
a trend towards higher mortality.10
Five randomized controlled published trials com-
pared endovascular therapy with usual therapy only
(Table 1):
The MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized
Clinical trial of Endovascular Treatment in the
Netherlands),11 using stent retrievers in 97% of the
cases, showed benefit of endovascular therapy up to
6 h after stroke onset in the proximal anterior circula-
tion in addition to best medical therapy (IVT up to
4.5 h in most patients). Onset to IVT was 85­87 min
in both intervention and control groups, and onset
time to arterial puncture was 260 min. The endovascu-
lar procedure was associated with a shift to improved
function at 90 days, as reflected in more patients in the
lower mRS categories, with an adjusted common odds
ratio (acOR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval (CI)
1.21­2.30).
Secondary outcome parameters (National Institutes
of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24 h and
1 week, recanalization at 24 h and final infarct at
1 week) were all indicating statistically significant
favoring of the intervention group. Treatment effect
was consistent in all pre-defined subgroups.
The ESCAPE trial (Endovascular treatment for
Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlu-
sion with Emphasis on minimizing CT to recanalization
times) was prematurely halted after randomization of
316 patients due to a positive interim analysis. To be
randomized, patients needed to have an NIHSS > 5, a
computer tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed
occlusion of the terminal carotid or MCA(M1 or
large M2 segment), good collaterals on multiphase
CTA, a computer tomography (CT) Alberta Stroke
Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) > 5, and had to
be enrolled <12 h. Recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (rtPA) before randomization was given if
patients were eligible. Results: The adjusted risk ratio
for an mRS shift with thrombectomy at 90 days was 3.1
(CI: 2.0­4.7). A favorable mRS of 0­2 at 90 days was
seen in 53.0% in thrombectomy vs. 29.3% in controls
(numbers needed to treat (NNT) ¼ 4), and reduction of
mortality was significant. All subgroups of patients had
similar benefit, including the elderly and patients treat-
able after 6 h from onset time. About 75% of patients
received IVT and stent retrievers were used in 86.1%.12
The SWIFT PRIME trial (SolitaireTM With the
Intention For Thrombectomy as PRIMary treatment
for acute ischemic strokE) was prematurely stopped
after a positive interim analysis of the first 196 patients.
To be randomized, all patients needed to have received
IVT < 4.5 h, an NIHSS score between 8 and 29, a CTA
or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showing an
occlusion of the intracranial carotid or M1 segment of
the MCA without extracranial carotid occlusion, an
ASPECTS > 6 and CT hypodensity (or magnetic reson-
ance imaging (MRI) hyperintensity) <1/3 of the MCA
territory, and treatable <6 h. Results (two co-primary
endpoints): The OR for an mRS shift at 90 days with
thrombectomy using the SolitaireTM FR stent retriever
was highly significant (p < 0.001), and mRS 0-2 at 90
days was 60.2% in thrombectomy patients vs. 35.5% in
controls (p < 0.001, NNT ¼ 4). There was a trend for
reduced mortality. The onset-to-arterial-puncture delay
was 252 min. All subgroups of patients had similar
benefit.13

Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits

day 3, was prematurely stopped because of a positive
interim analysis of the first 70 randomized patients. To
be randomized, all patients needed to have received
IVT < 4.5 h, a CTA or MRA showing an occlusion of
the intracranial carotid, M1 or M2 segment of the
MCA, significant mismatch and limited core on MR-
or CT perfusion (using the RAPIDÕ software), and had
to be treatable <6 h. Results (two co-primary end-
points): Early reperfusion of the ischemic tissue at
24 h with thrombectomy with the SolitaireTM FR
stent retriever was seen in 100% vs. 37% in the control
group (p < 0.001), an NIHSS reduction !8 points or
NIHSS 0-1 at three days was 80% with thrombectomy
vs. 37% in the control group (p < 0.001). At 90 days,
mRS 0-2 was 71% in thrombectomy patients and 40%
in controls (p < 0.01, NNT ¼ 3). There was a trend
towards reduction of mortality. The onset-to-arterial-
puncture delay was 210 min.14
The REVASCAT trial (Randomized Trial of
Revascularization with Solitaire FR Device versus Best
Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due
to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion
Presenting within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset) was
originally planned for 690 patients, but recruitment was
halted early because of loss of equipoise after positive
results published from other trials. Primary outcome
was the severity of global disability at 90 days, as mea-
sured on the mRS. All patients had confirmed proximal
anterior circulation occlusion and absence of a large
infarct on neuroimaging. Intravenous thrombolysis
was given in 68% of patients allocated to thrombectomy
and 78% of the controls. Thrombectomy reduced dis-
ability over the range of the mRS with an adjusted OR
for improvement of one point of 1.7 (95% CI 1.05­2.8).
An independent functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was
43.7% for thrombectomy and 28.2% for control
(adjusted odds ratio 2.1 (95% CI 1.1­4.0).15
Two further randomized controlled trials compared endovascular
therapy with usual therapy only; results to be published. In the
THRACE trial (Trial and Cost Effectiveness Evaluation
of Intra-arterial Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic
Stroke), patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis
within 4 h were randomized to mechanical thrombec-
tomy within 6 h with any approved device in France
vs. no further treatment. The trial was halted after the
second intermediate analysis of 395 patients. The results
presented recently showed a reduction of disability
in 12.1% with an independent functional outcome
(mRS 0-2) in 42.1% after IV thrombolysis alone and
54.2% after IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombec-
tomy and lend further strong support for adding mech-
anical thrombectomy in selected patients.16
The THERAPY-trial (THE Randomized, concur-
rent controlled trial to Assess the Penumbra sYstem's
safety and effectiveness in the treatment of acute stroke)
compared IV thrombolysis alone with added thrombus
aspiration with the PenumbraTM system within 6 h.
Because of the positive mechanical thrombectomy
trials, THERAPY was halted after 108 randomized
patients. Preliminary results were presented recently
and the intention to treat analysis showed a strong
trend for benefit with this intervention.17
In summary, there is very good evidence for early
thrombectomy with stent retrievers. There is good evi-
dence to favor stent retrievers over the MERCITM
device. At this moment, only limited data on other
types of recanalization devices such as the
PenumbraTM system are available.18 Given the variable
success rates and clinical outcomes with different reca-
nalization devices in randomized trials, generalizability
of all transvascular approaches cannot be assumed.
Meta-analysis of thrombectomy vs. standard treatment. A
meta-analysis of recent large trials comparing acute
thrombectomy with no further treatment in patients
with acute ischemic stroke and (suspected or docu-
mented) large intracranial artery occlusions was also
performed by one of the authors (TS). Large rando-
mized controlled trials with results published in peer-
reviewed journals over the last three years were
included. In a first analysis, all trials where included,
and in a second, only the recent ones (published in
2015) were used where stent retrievers were the predom-
inant thrombectomy method. Analysed outcomes were
favourable outcome defined as an mRS 0-2 at 90 days,
mortality at 90 days and symptomatic hemorrhage as
defined by each study group. ORs and 95% CIs of the
intention-to-treat analyses were calculated for each out-
come using the Mantel-Haenszel method with random
effects. Heterogeneity between trials was assessed by
several methods. All analyses were performed with
Review Manager (Version 5.2.6). Results are shown
in Figures 1 to 3. Adding thrombectomy did not
change the examined outcomes, except that favorable
three months outcome was significantly better (OR
2.29, CI 1.82­3.18) in recent thrombectomy trials.
Aspects to be considered in mechanical
thrombectomy
Mechanical thrombectomy in single centre cohorts: Outcomes
and risk factors. A recently published single-centre series
of 240 patients treated from 2005 to 2011 with mech-
anical thrombectomy alone or in addition to IVT
(40%) (initially using MERCITM and later on stent
retrievers) achieved 50% mRS 0-2 at three months
and reported 4.6% of SICH.19
In a retrospective single-centre cohort of 176 con-
secutive patients focusing on complications of

mechanical thrombectomy, it was shown that pro-
longed endovascular procedure beyond 1 h was asso-
ciated with higher complication rates (such as SICH,
embolism to new territories, dissection, vasospasm,
stent dislocation/occlusion, cumulative 11% rate), but
that the overall rate of SICH (5%) was comparable to
IVT.20 Post interventional subarachnoid hyperdensities
were not shown to influence outcomes.21
Mechanical thrombectomy in elderly patients. In MR
CLEAN, 16% of the patients were 80 years or older;
there was a positive treatment effect in this subgroup.
This effect was significant and its size not different from
the main effect size (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.21­8.62).10
Similarly, both randomized trials ESCAPE and
SWIFT PRIME (in the latter with upper age limit of
80 years old) showed benefit for all subgroups
including the elderly, who should thus be considered
for thrombectomy.11,12 Previously, mortality in patients
undergoing thrombectomy over 80 years of age was
reported to be double that for younger patients in a
large multicentre retrospective analysis in the US
(9300 patients, of which 18% were above 80).
However, the analysis period was restricted to 2008­
2010, the type of device used was not mentioned and
treatment effect could not be assessed.22 Almekhlafi
et al.23 used the SPAN-100 index (i.e. positive index if
age þ NIHSS score ¼ 100 or more) and found lower
proportions of favorable outcome in the patients with
positive (61%) compared to negative SPAN index
(27%, OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.9), with 60% of positive
SPAN index being 80 years of age and older. For the
vertebrobasilar circulation, a retrospective analysis
from a US nationwide database from 2006 to 2010
showed that age had an impact on in-hospital mortality
of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy
(n ¼ 631) but not IVT (n ¼ 1554), in particular those
65 years of age or older (43 vs. 23%). However, the
types of devices used during that period were not
reported.24
Time to treatment and reperfusion. The positive effect in
the MR CLEAN trial was time dependent, with acOR
decreasing from 3.0 (95% CI: 1.6­5.6) at 3.5 h onset to
reperfusion time, to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1­2.2) at 6 h.25
Treatment effect was not statistically significant any-
more when reperfusion was achieved after 6 h 19 m.
The benefit of thrombectomy was also shown to be
time dependent in IMS III, where increased time to
reperfusion was associated with a decreased probability
of good functional outcome (adjusted relative risk for
every 30-min delay 0Á88, 95% CI 0Á80­0Á98).4 Based on
IMS III results and literature review, a cutoff of
347 min (5 h 47 m) for superiority of endovascular pro-
cedure over IVT alone was recently suggested,26 and a
first statistical review of published randomized

controlled trials suggested a lower rate of good func-
tional outcome (mRS 0-2) if stroke onset to reperfusion
time exceeds 5­6 h.27 These findings underline the
necessity to treat as early as possible, and justify the
time window of treatment within 6 h from symptom
onset.
In the ESCAPE trial, however, 49 (15.5%) patients
were included beyond 6 h, and treatment effect was not
different but more advanced imaging (multiphase CTA)
for inclusion in the trial was used. Also REVASCAT
allowed inclusion up to 8 h.14 This leaves room to inves-
tigate the possibilities of expanding the treatment time
window for a selected group based on advanced
imaging.
Tandem pathology. In the MR CLEAN trial, 146 (29%)
patients had an additional extracranial ICA occlusion
(tandem pathology), with treatment effect in favor of
thrombectomy (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.78­2.64).10
In a systematic review of 32 studies including 1107
patients with intra and/or extracranial ICA occlusions,
intra-arterial thrombolysis was compared with any
kind of mechanical treatment and/or stent placement.
Only studies with clinical outcomes reported beyond 30
days were included, ICA occlusions caused by dissec-
tion were excluded. Acute stenting of occlusions of the
extracranial ICA resulted in a higher recanalization rate
(87% vs. 48%, p ¼ 0.001) and favorable outcomes
(68% vs. 15%, p < 0.001) as well as lower mortality
(18% vs. 41%, p ¼ 0.048) when compared to intra-
arterial thrombolysis.28
Recently published cohort studies indicate that
tandem stenosis/occlusions of the ICA/MCA can be
treated with acute stenting of the extracranial internal
carotid and stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy in
the MCA with a reasonable risk profile.29­33 However,
further evaluation of this treatment strategy is
warranted.
Basilar artery occlusion. Despite high mortality and mor-
bidity rates associated with basilar artery occlusion,34
evidence from RCT's on the effect of endovascular
treatment is lacking. A recent meta-analysis of 45
observational studies (n ¼ 2056) of reperfusion vs. no
reperfusion of acute basilar occlusion showed NNT of
3 and 2.5 to decrease death or dependency and death
alone, respectively.35
Single-centre studies with samples less than 100
patients have shown good functional outcomes follow-
ing thrombectomy of the basilar artery, ranging from
30%36,37 to 48%.38­40 Experience at the Karolinska
Hospital showed a 57% rate of good functional out-
come (95% CI 37% to 75%), and of 73% (95% CI
50% to 89%) when there were no signs of acute infarc-
tion prior to treatment, with about 21% mortality.41
Recanalization rates over 75% were reported with
new generation devices37,42 as well as with older gener-
ation devices in the MERCI and multi-MERCI trials
but with lower benefit.43
A previous prospective registry, the Basilar Artery
International Cooperation Study (BASICS) could
not demonstrate superiority of endovascular ther-
apy against IVT; however, it employed mostly older-
generation devices.44 The same investigators are now
undertaking the BASICS treatment randomized trial,
comparing thrombectomy <6 h in addition to IVT
with IVT alone.
Anesthesia in mechanical thrombectomy. Conscious sed-
ation has gained support from a retrospective analysis
of patients receiving either general anesthesia or con-
scious sedation (n ¼ 507 in both groups, 1:1 matching).
Patients receiving general anesthesia had significantly
more in-hospital mortality (25%) and pneumonia
(17%) compared to patients receiving conscious sed-
ation (12% and 9.3%, OR 2.37 and 2.0, respectively)
but similar rates of SICH.45 A recent mini review from
Takahashi et al.46 also supports conscious sedation.
Previous single-centre cohort studies47,48 and a review
of five such studies49 have reported similar findings.
The post-hoc analysis of the thrombectomy patients
in MR CLEAN showed better functional three
months outcome in the absence of general anesthe-
sia, but patients were not randomized to the type of
anesthesia.50 The issue of general anesthesia vs. sed-
ation is currently studied in four randomized
trials (ANSTROKE, COMET, GOLIATH and
SIESTA).51­54
An expert consensus statement of the Society of
Neurointerventional Surgery and the Neurocritical
Care Society recommends the use of general anes-
thesia for patients with severe agitation, low level of
consciousness (GCS < 8), loss of airway protect-
ive reflexes, respiratory compromise and in selected pos-
terior circulation stroke presenting with these features.55
Prehospital patient selection for immediate transfer to centers
with multimodal imaging and availability of thrombectomy. A
recently published SITS registry study found NIHSS
scores of 11 and 12 points as predictors of baseline
vessel occlusion and functional independence at three
months in a cohort of 11,632 patients treated with
intravenous thrombolysis with available baseline ima-
ging data and three month functional outcome.56
Moreover, if imaging was performed 3 h after stroke
onset, NIHSS scores thresholds decreased to 9 and
10 points in predicting baseline vessel occlusion and
functional independency at three months, respectively.
Higher NIHSS scores predicted large vessel occlusion
and functional dependence after three months if treated

Wahlgren et al. 141
with intravenous thrombolysis. These results are in line
with an initial single-centre retrospective study of
162 patients showing that an NIHSS score of 10 or
more points up to 6 h after stroke onset increased by
16.9-fold the odds of unfavorable outcome or death
(p ¼ 0.013), and by 7.13-fold the odds of proximal
vessel occlusion (p ¼ 0.013 and p < 0.038, respectively;
sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 78%).57
Imaging-guided patient selection. Acute non-invasive arter-
ial imaging: All recent RCT trials of thrombectomy
used non-invasive arterial imaging (CT-angiography
or MR-angiography of cerebral and neck arteries)
to select patients with an intracranial occlusion of the
distal carotid and/or MCA or M2 main stem. This may
be a reason why such trials were positive, in contrast
to the previous thrombectomy trials. If non-invasive
arterial imaging cannot be performed, an elevated
NIHSS ! 9 points within the first 3 h, and ! 7 between
3 and 6 h strongly suggests an occlusion of a major
intracranial artery.56,58 Still, acute non-invasive ima-
ging of cervical and intracranial arteries is clearly super-
ior to identify the appropriate patients for acute
mechanical thrombectomy.
ASPECTS (Alberta Score Program Early CT Score)
on plain CT: The MR CLEAN trial subgroup analysis
showed benefit of thrombectomy for patients with
ASPECTS scores of 5 or more points (5­7 points, OR
1.97 and 8­10 points, OR 1.61, respectively) but prob-
ably not with ASPECTS scores 0­4 (OR 1.09, 95% CI
0.14­8.46). A higher ASPECTS score indicates less
ischemic signs. Higher baseline ASPECTS also pre-
dicted favorable outcome in a cohort of 202 patients
treated with Solitaire FR21 and in a cohort 149 patients
treated with Solitaire and Penumbra aspiration
system59 The MR RESCUE study, in which the pen-
umbra was identified with multimodal CT or MRI for
patient randomization, showed neutral results for
mechanical thrombectomy. In the ESCAPE and
SWIFT-PRIME trials, a lower ASPECTS threshold
of 5 and 6 were applied, respectively. Above these
values, thrombectomy showed similar efficacy for dif-
ferent ASPECTS scores.11,12
MRI-based imaging: DWI, PWI, mismatch: The
single-centre RECOST study using MRI diffusion-
weighted imaging (DWI)-derived ASPECTS score on
165 patients showed benefit of thrombectomy when
using this imaging technique for patient selection where
the elderly could benefit from stent retriever thrombec-
tomy if the ischemic core volume was low (with a clear
cut-off at 70 years old) whereas all patients below 70
years of age could benefit.60 A smaller study from the
same centre on 31 consecutive patients, focusing on basi-
lar artery occlusion treated with Solitaire FR device,
found a good correlation between brainstem DWI
score <3 and favorable clinical outcome.40 The prospect-
ive, single-arm multicentre DEFUSE-2 trial showed
favorable clinical outcomes in patients selected for endo-
vascular treatment with MRI perfusion-weighted ima-
ging (PWI) mismatch in MCA or ICA occlusions
(n ¼ 98, about half pre-treated with IVT).61
Perfusion-CT-based imaging: A multicentre analysis
of 165 patients, the vast majority of whom underwent
endovascular or intravenous recanalization treatment,
showed independent prognostic value of core and pen-
umbra volumes on clinical outcome.62 The importance of
recanalization was particularly striking in patients with
large penumbra volumes.63 In the positive EXTEND-IA
trial, patients were selected based on a CT perfusion
examination (CTP) showing a mismatch ratio >1.2,
and absolute mismatch volume >10 ml, and an ischemic
core lesion volume <70 ml, using RAPIDTM software.13
Discussion regarding ongoing and future studies
on mechanical thrombectomy
The recent results from several randomized controlled
studies could potentially influence patient recruitment
in ongoing RCT's such as PISTE64 or BASICS.65 Until
steering committees of the respective trials have halted
the trial, randomization should be continued to help
answer uncertainties of benefit and risk from thromb-
ectomy in acute ischemic stroke.
Studies comparing active centres (IVT þ possibility
for thrombectomy) with control centres that do not
yet have access to thrombectomy (IVT treatment
alone), e.g. SITS-OPEN,66 should continue its recruit-
ment to strengthen the level of evidence. There are
many reasons to recommend this approach such as
the need for confirmatory studies, the desirability of
narrowing the confidence interval to get a tighter esti-
mate of the effect size for health economic reasons and
the necessity for a wide range of data allowing sub-
group analysis with adequate power. This type of
design will also test thrombectomy in standard clinical
practice in experienced centres.
In addition, it is desirable that all patients undergo-
ing some form of acute revascularization therapy (IVT,
mechanical thrombectomy, etc.) are prospectively
included in registries (e.g. SITS-ISTR67 or SITS-
TBY68) to ensure further evidence from routine clinical
practice data.

Treatment recommendations
. Mechanical thrombectomy, in addition to intraven-
ous thrombolysis within 4.5 h when eligible, is rec-
ommended to treat acute stroke patients with large
artery occlusions in the anterior circulation up to 6 h
after symptom onset (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU
Grade A). ­ new
. Mechanical thrombectomy should not prevent the
initiation of intravenous thrombolysis where this is
indicated, and intravenous thrombolysis should not
delay mechanical thrombectomy (Grade A, Level 1a,
KSU Grade A). ­ changed
. Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed
as soon as possible after its indication (Grade A,
Level 1a, KSU Grade A).
. For mechanical thrombectomy, stent retrievers
approved by local health authorities should primar-
ily be considered (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade
A). ­ new
. Other thrombectomy or aspiration devices approved
by local health authorities may be used upon the neu-
rointerventionists discretion if rapid, complete and
safe revascularisation of the target vessel can be
achieved (Grade C, Level 2a, KSU Grade C) ­ new
. If intravenous thrombolysis is contraindicated (e.g.
Warfarin-treated with therapeutic INR) mechanical
thrombectomy is recommended as first-line treatment
in large vessel occlusions (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU
Grade A) ­ changed and updated level of evidence.
. Patients with acute basilar artery occlusion should
be evaluated in centres with multimodal imaging and
treated with mechanical thrombectomy in addition
to intravenous thrombolysis when indicated (Grade
C, Level 4, KSU Grade C); alternatively they may be
treated within a randomized controlled trial for
thrombectomy approved by the local ethical com-
mittee ­ new
. The decision to undertake mechanical thrombec-
tomy should be made jointly by a multidisciplinary
team comprising at least a stroke physician and a
neurointerventionist and performed in experienced
centres providing comprehensive stroke care
and expertise in neuroanaesthesiology (Grade C,
Level 5, GCP, KSU Grade C).
. Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed by
a trained and experienced neurointerventionist who
meets national and/or international requirements
(Grade B, Level 2b, KSU Grade B) ­ changed in
level of evidence.
. The choice of anaesthesia depends on the individual
situation; independently of the method chosen, all
efforts should be made to avoid thrombectomy
delays (Grade C, Level 2b, KSU Grade C) ­ changed.
Patient selection
. Intracranial vessel occlusion must be diagnosed with
non-invasive imaging whenever possible before con-
sidering treatment with mechanical thrombectomy
(Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade A) ­ new.
. If vessel imaging is not available at baseline, a
NIHSS score of ! 9 within three, and ! 7 points
within 6 h may indicate the presence of large vessel
occlusion (Grade B, Level 2a, KSU Grade B) ­ new.
. Patients with radiological signs of large infarcts
(for ex. using the ASPECTS score) may be unsuit-
able for thrombectomy (Grade B, Level 2a, KSU
Grade B) ­ new
. Imaging techniques for determining infarct and
penumbra sizes can be used for patient selection
and correlate with functional outcome after mechan-
ical thrombectomy (Grade B, Level 1b, KSU
Grade B) ­ new.
. High age alone is not a reason to withhold mechan-
ical thrombectomy as an adjunctive treatment
(Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade A) ­ new.
Recommendation for implementation,
registries and further trials
. Health authorities are strongly encouraged to imple-
ment access to thrombectomy within a reasonable
time range in a network including stroke centres.
Access to thrombectomy should be organised in
a way that time between symptoms onset and to
thrombectomy is minimised and that adequate com-
petence within neurointervention, neurology, neuror-
adiology, neurosurgery and neuroanaesthesiology is
provided. ­ new.
. It is encouraged to perform and include patients in
RCT addressing unresolved thrombectomy ques-
tions such as thrombectomy for basilar artery
occlusion, treatment in a late und unknown time
windows, treating patients with imaging findings
not sufficiently covered in recent trials, com-
paring new devices with widely-used stent retrie-
vers, thrombectomy with or without intravenous
thrombolysis, and different types of anaesthesia.
­ new.
. Non-randomized trials comparing centres not yet
having access to mechanical thrombectomy with
others should continue (such as SITS OPEN) ­ new.

Appendix 1
Strength of evidence supporting recommendations as
defined by the Karolinska Stroke Update consensus
meeting (1998):
KSU GRADE A evidence: Strong support from ran-
domized controlled trials and statistical reviews (at least
one randomized controlled trial plus one statistical
review)
KSU GRADE B evidence: Support from rando-
mized controlled trials and statistical reviews (one ran-
domized controlled trial or one statistical review)
KSU GRADE C evidence: No reasonable support
from randomized controlled trials, recommendations
based on small randomized and/or non-randomized
controlled trials evidence.
Appendix 2
Levels and grades of evidence for therapy/prevention as
defined by the Oxford centre for evidence-based medi-
cine (2009), resumed:
Grade A: consistent Level 1 studies.
Grade B: consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapola-
tions from level 1 studies.
Grade C: level 4 studies or extrapolations from level
2 or 3 studies.
Level 1a: systematic review (homogeneity) of RCTs.
Level 1b: individual RCT (with narrow confidence
interval).
Level 2a: systematic review (homogeneity) of cohort
studies.
Level 2b: individual cohort study/low quality RCT
e.g. with less than 80% follow-up.
Level 3a: systematic review (homogeneity) of case-
control studies Level 3b: individual case-control study.
Level 4: case-series.
Level 5: expert opinion.
