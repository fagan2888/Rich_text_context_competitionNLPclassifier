Intellectual capital has recently been receiving increased attention from both academic
communities and practitioners, and is identified as an important strategic asset which
provides sustainability and yields better performance. It also gives rise to the view
that the organizations which possess skilled, creative, and distinctive knowledgeable
employees along with supportive organizational structures and systems, and main-
tains cordial customer relations contribute in achieving superior organizational posi-
tion. Hence, it is important to understand to what extent intellectual capital is efficiently
utilized by specific sectors in creating value for organizations (Kamath, 2007). The
present study aims to develop, establish, and empirically validate the intellectual capital
scale in the banking sector, in the context of emerging economies like India.
Data were collected from three executives each (including one manager and two senior
employees) from 144 branches of 21 public and seven private commercial banks oper-
ating in Jammu city, India. The three senior most executives were purposively selected
because of being more knowledgeable and experienced. The study established the intel-
lectual capital scale as a multidimensional scale comprising human capital, relational
capital, and structural capital. All the three dimensions were found to significantly
contribute to the intellectual capital, among which relational capital contributed rela-
tively more, followed by human capital and structural capital.
Relational capital consists of important items like meeting with customers, customer
feedback, and knowledge and regular customer interaction. Similarly, human capital
dimension consists of significant items like employee creativity, devoted staff, training
and education, experience, attitude, and innovative employees. Structural capital is a
composite of valuable items like structure, systems, information technology, capabilities,
culture, empowerment, and service quality which helps in developing intellectual capital.
The research findings can help bank managers in determining how to generate value
using human, structural, and relational capital. For instance, the study findings offer
valuable insight into how the managers can improve bank's structural capital by encour-
aging innovation ability among employees, positive culture, and strengthening informa-
tion technology in terms of continuously updating software and hardware. The study is
limited to public and private commercial banks operating in Jammu city. In future, the
scale validation can be undertaken to investigate whether the three-dimensional intel-
lectual capital scale can be generalized for other industries and countries.

62 MEASUREMENT OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL IN THE INDIAN BANKING SECTOR
Over the past few decades, intangible assets
have become a basic source of organizational
wealth creation and sustainable competitive
advantage (Garcia-Ayuso, 2003). Intellectual capital is
one of the essential blocks of intangible assets, which
is becoming a critical factor for organizational perfor-
mance (Hsu & Fang, 2009). Researchers such as Stewart
(1997), Sveiby (1997), and Edvinson (1997) remarked
that the creation of economic value was largely based on
intangible resources and capabilities, as these were the
most powerful tools to enhance organizational compet-
itiveness. In simple words, intellectual capital is a value
driver of an organization which gives it a competitive
edge. Therefore, it is important to understand to what
extentintellectualcapitalisefficientlyutilizedbyspecific
sectors in creating value for organizations (Kamath,
2007). In this context, Tseng and Goo (2005) signified the
need to know how intellectual capital created value in
an organization. Similarly, scholars like Ahangar (2011),
Ahmad and Musharaf (2011), Andriessen (2003), and
Maditinos, Chatzoudes, and Tsairidis (2011) empha-
sized on the need to explore how intellectual capital
could be managed and measured properly. Scholars
such as Hormiga, Canino, and Medina (2010), Hsu and
Fang (2009), Kamukama, Ahiauzu, and Ntayi (2011),
Kong and Prior (2008), Salleh and Selamat (2007), and
Wu, Chang, and Chen (2008) have conceptualized intel-
lectual capital but still there is a lack of universally
acceptable definition of intellectual capital. Further,
Cabrita and Bontis (2008), Choudhary (2010), Jaradat,
Samraie, and Jadallah (2012), and Sharabati, Jawad,
and Bontis (2010) have measured intellectual capital
but from varied aspects and that too in different sectors
and in different countries. Kamath (2007) and Rehman,
Usman, and Asgar (2012) have measured intellectual
capital in the banking sector using VAIC (value added
intellectual coefficient), based on secondary data. A few
studies, based on primary data, have been conducted
on measurement of intellectual capital in sectors such
as microfinance, banking, etc. For example, Cabrita and
Bontis (2008) study on Portuguese banks. It also meas-
ured intellectual capital based on human capital, rela-
tional capital, and structural capital but with limited
number of items.
Besides, a few studies such as Choudhary (2010), Jaradat
et al. (2012), and Sharabati et al. (2010) have measured IC
in different services sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals,
and microfinance. However, no study has been found
to measure intellectual capital based on the perception
of the managers/executives, in the Indian context in
general and in the banking sector in particular.
Being a knowledge-intensive, skill-based, and rela-
tionship-service industry, banking is an ideal sector
to study intellectual capital. Banks exploit intellec-
tual capital for its survival in the competitive market
through extensive use of human capital, structural
capital, and relational capital (Kamath, 2007). The role
and working of employees, at different positions and
levels, in the banking service sector are directly linked
with the knowledge and intellect of employees (Bontis,
2000). According to Bontis (2000), it is the quality of
people, organizational structure, and relationships
of people which give banks the competitive edge in a
knowledge-based economy.
Hence, the main objective of this study is to establish
and empirically validate the intellectual capital scale
in the banking sector. The specific objectives include
defining the elements of intellectual capital to construct
the intellectual capital scale based on measurement
models, and to test the reliability and validity of the
scale through an empirical study.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES
DEVELOPMENT
Intellectual Capital
Intellectual capital is conceptualized as intangible
resources that generate value for an organization
(Hunter, Webster, & Wyatt, 2005). One of the most
succinct definitions of intellectual capital as `packaged
useful knowledge' is given by Stewart (1997). Edvinson
(1997) recognized intellectual capital as a set of intan-
gible assets such as resources, competencies, and capa-
bilities which not only increased organizational perfor-
mance but also resulted in value creation. Further, Kim,
Yoo, and Lee (2011) described intellectual capital as a
non-monetary asset that eventually reaped economic
benefits. Edvinson (1997) and Sullivan (1999), the
major contributors of the concept, on the other hand,
related intellectual capital with a composite of human
competencies, knowledge, ability, skills, experience,
and customer relationships that provided an organiza-
tion competitive edge in the market. This concept was
extended by Ulrich (1998), who equated intellectual
capital to commitment and competence of employees.
Various typologies are proposed by different researchers
in the literature. Among these, the three-dimensional
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 63
classificationofintellectualcapital,thatishumancapital,
structural capital, and relational capital has achieved a
certain degree of consensus among researchers such as
Bontis (2000), Kavida and Sivakumar (2009), Roos and
Roos (1997), Stewart (1997), and Svieby (1997).
Human Capital
Human capital is the basic component in the intellec-
tual capital development process (Yang & Lin, 2009).
It is inherent in people and hence cannot be directly
owned by an organization (Edvinson & Malone, 1997).
Human capital denotes what employees bring into the
value adding processes, and encompasses professional
competence, employee motivation, and leadership
ability (Halim, 2010). Kavida and Sivakumar (2009)
viewed human capital as a summation of employees'
skill, capabilities, experience, education, and attitude
about life and business. Various competencies such
as learning and education, experience and expertise,
creativity, staff attitude as well as recruitment and
training plays a significant role in the development of
human capital (Lings & Greenley, 2005; Sharabati et
al., 2010; Subramaniam & Youndt, 2005). For instance,
educated, experienced, trained, creative, and motivated
employees can work more efficiently and thereby result
in the creation of organizational capital.
Relational Capital
Relational capital results from organization's rela-
tionship with customers, partners, shareholders, and
other stakeholders that are critical to the organizational
performance (Bontis, Crossan, & Hulland, 2002). Shih,
Chang, and Lin (2010) contended relational capital
as the interaction between organizations, customers,
suppliers, contractors, and other affiliated partners.
Low (2000) explicated relational capital as the flow
of knowledge from an organization to external envi-
ronment. The competencies such as customer relation
as well as customer loyalty and trust play significant
role in the development of relational capital (Isaac,
Herremans, & Kline, 2010; Sharabati et al., 2010). For
instance, higher the degree of customer loyalty and
trust, better will be the relationship with customers
which subsequently enhances organizational value.
Structural Capital
Structural capital refers to the mechanism and structure
of an organization that helps to support employees for
optimum intellectual performance (Bollen, Vergauwen,
& Schnieders, 2005). Edvinson and Malone (1997) high-
lighted that structural capital consisted of non-human
store houses of knowledge in an organization which
are embedded in systems, databases, and programmes.
Further, Bontis et al. (2002) remarked that an individual
in an organization could never reach the fullest potential
of its systems if its procedures were poor. The structural
capital is the outcome that is extended from systems
and programmes, information technology, culture,
and renewal and development which significantly
contribute to the development of structural capital
scale (Choudhary, 2010; Isaac, Herremans, & Kline,
2010; Sharabati et al., 2010). For example, well-defined
structures, programmes, systems, and information
technology enhance the efficiency of employees and
can create better customer relations, thereby enhancing
the organizational value.
Majority of the researchers such as Ahmadi, Ahmadi,
and Shakeri (2011); Allameh, Abassi, and Shokrani
(2010), Cabrita and Bontis (2008), Hsu and Fang (2009),
and Shih et al. (2010) considered human capital as the
core component that influenced both relational capital
and structural capital. However, Cabrita and Bontis
(2008) and Allameh et al. (2010) found that human
capital influenced relational capital not only directly
but also indirectly through structural capital in banks
and hospitals respectively. This was also supple-
mented by Shih et al. (2010), who identified human
capital as exhibiting positive and direct effect over rela-
tional capital and structural capital in service as well
as in banking sectors. Even Allameh et al. (2010) found
human capital to impact relational capital in service
and manufacturing organizations. Further, Shih et
al. (2010) underscored both relational and structural
capital having positive and direct impact on each other.
Hence, it is concluded that all the dimensions of intel-
lectual capital affect each other.
Based on this backdrop, the following hypotheses are
formulated as shown in Figure 1.

Generation of Scale Items
The main objective of the research article is to develop
a scale to measure intellectual capital in the banking
sector. As discussed in the previous section, intellectual
capital is considered to be a composite of three major
dimensions: human capital, relational capital, and
structural capital. The items used for the measurement
of intellectual capital in the banking sector were gener-
ated using the following steps:
First, relevant studies were identified from the scanned
literature to draw a pool of scale items for the measure-
ment of the three dimensions. Second, to make the scale
comprehension more clear and relevant for the banking
sector, a number of self-developed items were designed.
Third, all identified, selected, and designed items were
discussed with five academicians and five doctoral
students to critically evaluate and check for their clarity
and unambiguity. At this stage, few suggestions were
incorporated on the basis of received feedback. Fourth,
all the selected items were finally discussed with five
bank managers and accordingly some modifications in
the form of alteration and deletion were done. Lastly,
all the selected items were pretested on 55 managers
to establish the content validity of the scale items. At
this stage, few of the items were modified and the rest
were kept the same for final data collection. All these
steps identified 63 items to measure intellectual capital
that included 34 items extracted from literature, and 26
self-developed items.
Human Capital
The five major significant characteristics of human
capital, as identified from the scanned literature, include
learning and education (Sharabati et al., 2010), experi-
ence and expertise (Sharabati et al., 2010; Subramaniam
& Youndt, 2005), creativity (Choudhary, 2010; Rudrez
& Mihalic, 2007; Sharabati et al., 2010; Subramaniam
& Youndt, 2005), staff attitude (Lings & Greenley,
2005), and recruitment and training (Sharabati et al.,
2010). To capture the domain of human capital, items
related to learning and education were borrowed from
the works of Sharabati et al. (2010) and Subramaniam
and Youndt (2005), along with some self-developed
items such as `competence of bank employees matches
with their work requirements and responsibilities'
and `bank always keeps itself up-to-date for profes-
sional skills'. While items of experience and expertise
such as `experienced and expert employees work more
efficiently' and `employees consistently perform at
their best in the bank' were adopted from the study of
Sharabati et al. (2010), staff attitude was measured with
the help of items like `employees are well motivated'
and `employees are happy to take more responsibility'
which were extracted from the works of Lings and
Greenley (2005). The items pertaining to recruitment
and training like `bank's recruitment programmes is
comprehensive' and `bank upgrades employees skills
through training programme' were extracted from the
studies of Zerenler, Hasiloglu, and Sezgin (2008) along
with one self-developed item, namely, `bank's educa-
tion and training programmes are beneficial'.
Relational Capital
The third component of intellectual capital focuses on
relationships of employees with internal and external
stakeholders. It embraces items related to trust and
loyalty that an organization creates by maintaining
good relationship with customers and the rest of the
society. Thus, to assess relational capital, items related
to customer knowledge like `data about customers are
continuously updated' and `bank continuously meets
with customers to find out what they want from it' were
taken from the studies of Isaac et al. (2010) and Sharabati
et al. (2010) along with a few self-developed items such
as `feedback of customers is shared across departments
in bank'. On the other hand, the customer loyalty and
trust items (e.g., `employees discover and solve prob-
lems through mutual cooperation' and `customers trust
bank with open communication') were extracted from
the scale items used by Hafeez and Muhammad (2012).
Structural Capital
The supportive infrastructure of an organization
consists of important sub-dimensions like systems and
programmes, information technology, organizational
cultureaswellasrenewalanddevelopmentthatenhance
employees' capabilities to do work. To measure struc-
tural capital, items related to system and programmes,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 65
and information technology were extracted from the
works of Choudhary (2010), Sharabati et al. (2010), and
Subramaniam and Youndt (2005), and items related to
renewal and development were self-designed which
included `bank constantly improves service quality',
`there is great support for innovative ideas in this
bank', and `bank continuously develops new product
and services'. Items related to organizational culture
were drawn from the works of Amiri et al. (2010), e.g.,
`atmosphere in this bank is pleasant'.
SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION
The present study exclusively focused on the Indian
scheduled commercial banks, both public and private
sector banks, operational across India. Since all the
banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
and work according to its guidelines, their functioning
with respect to working culture, management and policy
guidelines, in general, is considered at par with each
other. Further, all managers and employees working in
different bank branches in Jammu have the exposure
of working in different representative branches across
India, as all banks have transferable job option.
The sampling frame of the study consisted of 144
branches of 21 public and seven new private banks
functioning in Jammu city. The data were collected
from three executives each (one branch manager
and two senior most employees) from 144 branches.
These respondents, selected on the basis of purposive
sampling, were more knowledgeable, experienced and
had clear understanding of the operational functioning
of banks at different levels. Finally, a total of 576 ques-
tionnaires were distributed to the respondents, out of
which 339 questionnaires were returned (response rate
of 62.08%).
Descriptive Statistics
Before proceeding for analysis, negative responses
assigned to some items were reversed. Additionally,
10 outlier responses were identified for deletion. The
normality of data was investigated, and the items
falling within the liberal range of skewness (­1.5 to +1.5)
and kurtosis (­0.5 to +6.5) were retained (Kline, 1998).
The mean and standard deviation of the constructs are
shown in Table 1.
Reliability
The consistency of data was established through
Cronbach's alpha. All the dimensions of intellec-
tual capital reported acceptable alpha values in the
range of 0.820 to 0.913 (Hair, Black, Babi, Anderson, &
Tatham, 2008). The Cronbach's alpha value for the main
construct intellectual capital is recorded as 0.906 and its
dimensions­human capital, structural capital, and rela-
tional capital, recorded alpha values of 0.913, 0.820, and
0.908, respectively.
Exploratory Factor Analysis
The various criteria that include Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) above 0.7 (for sampling adequacy), Bartlett
Test of Sphericity (BTS) (for establishing significance
and correlation among items), and eigen value greater
than 1 (for identifying number of factors) were checked
before processing data for reduction and purification.
Later, items with communalities less than 0.5, factor
loadings less than 0.4 (Sharabati et al., 2010), and
cross loading values were deleted simultaneously
until clean factors emerged. The exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) was run both dimension-wise and on
the overall intellectual capital scale. Out of the 31
items of human capital, 13 were retained across four

factors. In structural capital, 16 were retained out of 21
items under four factors. Likewise, out of the 11 items
of relational capital, seven were retained under two
factors. The EFA results are shown in Table 2. Majority
of the alpha values for factors identified under EFA
were greater than 0.7, excluding staff attitude (0.625)
and culture factors (0.694) (Table 2). The staff attitude
factor with a relatively less alpha value than the
threshold value of 0.7 is retained as all the three items
relating to conducive working environment, ready to
put extra efforts and devoted to their jobs, obtained

that the factor is quite reliable (Netmeyer, Bearder, &

Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Before running confirmatory factor analysis (CFA),
summated observed variables for all latent factors
extracted previously using EFA under human, rela-
tional, and structural capital dimensions were created.
Following this, the three intellectual capital models--
three-dimensional, two-dimensional, and unidimen-
sional--were created to test and confirm the relation-
ships of summated variables with respective latent
dimensions (Table 3). The three-dimensional model
comprised all items identified in three dimensions--
human capital, relational capital, and structural capital.
The two-dimensional model comprised two dimen-
sions `human capital and relational capital', considered
as single-dimension related to human behaviour,
human relation, and competence and structural capital.
The unidimensional model considered all summated
items of three dimensions in a single factor. Based on
the threshold criteria of model fit measures given by
Malhotra and Dash (2010), intellectual capital model
comprising three dimensions was found to be the best
fit model (Figure 2), whereas the other two models, that
is, two-dimensional model and unidimensional model,
with inadequate fit indices, were rejected. Further, one
of the four factors of structural capital got deleted in
the accepted three-dimensional model, as its deletion
resulted in better model fit. Besides, precaution was
also taken to ensure that deletion had no effect on the
meaning of the construct. Hence, deletion was no threat
to the content validity. The fitness measures of the three
models are given in Table 3. All the fit indices of the
three-dimensional model met the threshold criteria for
an excellent fit except Relative Fit Index (RFI), which
was marginally close to 0.9.
Psychometric Properties
The result of the psychometric characteristics of intel-
lectual capital scale and its three dimensions are given
in Table 4. The composite reliability (CR) of the intellec-
tual capital scale along with human capital, relational
capital, and structural capital was assessed. The three
subscales, namely, human capital, relational capital, and
structural capital, show CR values as 0.746, 0.863, and
0.916, respectively. Since all the composite reliability
values are above threshold values of 0.7, all the subscales
are established as reliable and consistent (Malhotra &
Dash, 2010). To assess the convergent validity, Average
Variance Extracted (AVE) for human capital, relational
capital, and structural capital were computed and their
values were obtained as 0.643, 0.763, and 0.786, respec-
tively (all greater than 0.5). Hence, convergent validity
of all the scales is also established. Further, discriminant

validity of sub-scales was also ascertained. For instance,
discriminant validity for human capital was estab-
lished, as the square root values of AVE that is recorded
as 0.801 for human capital is greater than the correlation
between relational capital and structural capital that is
traced as 0.589. Likewise, discriminant validity for rela-
tional capital and structural capital was also established.
Nomological Validity
The study further assessed nomological validity which
exhibits the relationship of one construct with another
construct in accordance with the relevant theory. The
nomological validity in the study was established
by identifying how well intellectual capital corre-
lated with business performance (Figure 3). There are
well grounded theoretical reasons to expect a posi-
tive relationship between intellectual capital and busi-
ness performance, as various researchers like Ahangar
(2011), Ahmadi et al. (2011), Goh (2005), and Sharabati
et al. (2010) emphasized that intellectual capital played
an important role in improving business performance of
organizations. The business performance of the banks
was assessed through growth, market share, profit-
ability, and Return on Assets (ROA). All these items
were used by Latif, Malik, and Aslam (2012) to measure
business performance in the banking sector. The struc-
tural equation model (SEM) was applied to examine
the relationship between intellectual capital and busi-
ness performance. The intellectual capital and business
performance model reflects robust indices for 2/df,

and incremental fit indices like Normed Fit Index (NFI),
Relative fit Index (RFI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI),

(CFI) which were recorded as 3.119, 0.80, 0.914, 0.876,
0.940, 0.912, and 0.939, respectively. The positive regres-
sion weights (beta value = 0.345) and significant critical

ratio (CR) values (5.215) of the relationship between
intellectual capital and business performance confirmed
the nomological validity of the intellectual scale.
Common Method Variance
Besides, assessing reliability and validity of the intel-
lectual capital scale, common method variance was
also examined to assess the variance that items had in
common with each other. First, Harmon's one factor
method using exploratory factor analysis was applied
on all the dimensions of intellectual capital taken
together, in which the variance extracted was identi-
fied as 29.82 per cent (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, &
Podsakoff, 2003). This value suggests absence of any
significant influence of common variance. Second, the
latent variable approach was also used by adding a first
order factor with all the measures of human capital,
relational capital, and structural capital as observed
indicators. Again common variance of 9 per cent was
recorded which indicates that biasness is not an issue
in this study (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
HYPOTHESES TESTING
After assessing the psychometric properties of the intel-
lectual scale and its subscales, the hypotheses formu-
lated were tested using SEM.
Intellectual capital is positively influenced by human
capital, relational capital, and structural capital
(Model 1): This model is found to be robust fit with
2/df = 3.119, RMSEA = 0.80, NFI = 0.914, RFI = 0.876,
IFI = 0.940, TLI = 0.912, CFI = 0.939. All the three
dimensions of intellectual capital--human capital,
relational capital, and structural capital--are found
to significantly and strongly affect intellectual capital
as all critical ratios (CR) are above 1.96 at 5 per cent
significant level and standard regression weight (SRW)
values are above 0.5 (Table 5). Hence, Hypothesis
H1 is accepted. The study results are consistent with
the results of Cabrita and Bontis (2008) study which
indicated that the three constructs that made up
intellectual capital significantly affected one another,
and then subsequently affected intellectual capital.
Further, Shih et al. (2010) contemplated that human
capital was primarily predicted through employees'
capabilities and employees training. In the present
study also, both factors including items such as
`employees undergo continuous training programmes'
and `employees are educated enough to do their jobs'
contribute significantly in developing human capital.
Akin to the results of Shih et al. (2010), organizational
culture and innovation ability are considered to be
important for enhancing structural capital. However,
information technology, comprising items such as `bank
is embedded with information technology software'
and `information technology contributes to service
quality', is seen as an additional factor to influence
structural capital. Further, similar to the results of
Halim (2010), the present study also witnesses that
customer relationship is a significant factor which
capitalizes relational capital along with employee
relationship comprising items like `employees enhance
their capabilities through interactions' and `employees
discover and solve problems through interactions'.
Human capital significantly affects relational capital
(Model 2): In this model, the effect of human capital
on relational capital was assessed. The human capital
and relational capital model fit indices were arrived at
2/df = 1.533, RMSEA = 0.04, NFI = 0.972, RFI = 0.948,
IFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.981, CFI = 0.99 which depict the
model to be best fit. The CR and SRW values comes out
to be 8.487 and 0.864 respectively, which establishes that
human capital significantly and strongly affects rela-
tional capital. Hence, Hypothesis H2a is accepted. These
results are in line with studies of Allameh et al. (2010)
and Cabrita and Bontis (2008). According to Cabrita
and Bontis (2008), increased training of employees and
employee motivation could lead to higher productivity
and enhanced creativity, thereby resulting in satisfied
and loyal clients. Further, they concluded that high

calibre employees developed better customer relation-
ships because of their professional knowledge, expe-
rience, and capabilities and promoted accumulation
of relational capital. In addition, Allameh et al. (2010)
exhibited that abilities, competences, and know-how
that human resources possessed helped an organiza-
tion in building good customer relations and knowl-
edge sharing. In addition, the study also identified other
factors like competence, creativity, employee attitude,
staff attitude, culture, and employee relationship which
can enhance and generate valuable human capital.
Human capital significantly affects structural capital
(Model 3): In this model, the effect of human capital on
structural capital was examined. The human capital and
structural capital model showed robust fit indices (2/
df = 2.869, RMSEA= 0.075, NFI = 0.939, RFI = 0.902, IFI =
0.959, TLI = 0.934, CFI = 0.959) with CR and SRW values
as 7.413 and 0.768 respectively. The results indicate that
structural capital is significantly and strongly affected
by human capital. Hence, Hypothesis H2b is accepted.
The results are compatible with the studies of Shih et
al. (2010) and Cabrita and Bontis (2008). These scholars
argue that human capital exhibits positive and direct
influence on structural capital. According to Cabrita
and Bontis (2008), employees' competence, creativity,
and staff attitude exhibit positive influence on structural
capital as employee abilities affect organizations'
culture, process efficiency, and innovation processes.
On the other hand, Shih et al. (2010) demonstrated
that banks with rich human capital not only boosted
their operational efficiency but also accumulated good
structural capital by creating innovative capabilities,
and promising organizational culture. In addition,
this study identifies other factors such as information
technology and culture which affect structural capital
but are not considered by the researchers such as Shih
et al. (2010) and Cabrita and Bontis (2008).
Structural capital significantly affects relational
capital (Model 4): In this hypothesized model, the
relationship between relational capital and structural
capital was tested. The effect of structural capital on
relational capital was determined in which all model
fit indices were found to have acceptable values
above the threshold criteria (2/df = 1.818, RMSEA
= 0.05, NFI = 0.983, RFI = 0.959, IFI = 0.992, TLI =
0.981, CFI = 0.992). The results show that structural
capital significantly affects relational capital (CR =
8.07). Further, the magnitude of SRW (0.886) reflects
the relationship between relational capital and struc-
tural capital to be robust. Hence, Hypothesis H2c is
accepted. The results support the findings of Cabrita
and Bontis (2008) that structural capital significantly
affects customer relationship. Further, they concluded
that organizational culture, processes, and innovation
ability attracted or retained more and more customers
in the organization, thereby enhancing customer
relationship in an organization. Unlike studies such
as Shih et al. (2010) and Cabrita and Bontis (2008),
this study finds significant role of information tech-
nology in creating employee relationship and thereby
enhancing relational capital.
CONCLUSION
The article presents the development of reliable and
valid intellectual capital scale for the banking sector.
Among the three measurement models, unidimensional
and two-dimensional models stand rejected due to
inadequate fit indices while the three-dimensional
model comprising human capital, relational capital, and
structural capital as three different dimensions is found
to be significant in comprehending intellectual capital,
and is hence accepted. The intellectual capital scale was
finalized using data purification consisted of 36 items.
The study finds that human capital dimension consists
of significant items like employee creativity, devoted
staff, training and education, experience, attitude and
innovative employees, which are also identified as
important ingredients of human capital by studies such
as Sharabati et al. (2010) and Subramaniam and Youndt
(2005). In line with the findings of studies, namely,
Isaac et al. (2010), Li and Yang (2009), and Sharabati
et al. (2010), relational capital consists of important
items like meeting with customers, customer feedback
and knowledge, and regular customer interaction.
Similarly, structural capital, which is a composite of
significant items like structure, systems, information
technology, capabilities, culture, empowerment and
service quality is also accepted by researchers such as
Choudhary (2010), Isaac et al. (2010), and Sharabati et al.
(2010). Further, it is also confirmed that human capital,
relational capital, and structural capital positively
affect intellectual capital. Among the three dimensions,
contribution of relational capital with a beta value of
0.938 is found to be slightly higher than human capital
(beta value = 0.930) followed by structural capital (beta
value = 0.839) to the intellectual capital. The results are
consistent with the studies of Cabrita and Bontis (2008)
and Allameh et al. (2010) which observed that the three
dimensions of intellectual capital significantly affected
each other as well as intellectual capital.

IMPLICATIONS
The present study contributes to the measurement
stream of intellectual capital research by developing and
validating the measurement scale of intellectual capital.
The study has a number of implications for researchers
and practitioners. This intellectual capital scale
development can act as a stimulus for future research
for scholars. The study is expected to enable scholars,
practitioners, managers, and investors to have more
clear understanding of intellectual capital. Similarly,
bank managers can have better understanding of how
intellectual capital develops and drives performance.
The managers can use intellectual capital as a tool to
evaluate organizational performance, which can also
enable them to know how value can be created with
the help of trained, educated, and creative employees
(Cabrita & Bontis, 2008). Further, relational capital
being a crucial part of intellectual capital can help
the managers to know how it can enhance the ability
of employees through interaction and collaboration
among themselves and customers. By focusing on high
value-added products and services and good physical
environment, banks can strive for establishing a good
long-lasting relationship with the customers (Shih et
al., 2010). Furthermore, the study provides insights into
how the managers can improve bank's structural capital
by encouraging innovation ability among employees,
positive culture, and strengthening information
technology in terms of continuously updating software
and hardware.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The present study is confined to scale development of
intellectual capital in the banking sector of Jammu city,
India. The scale validation needs to be undertaken in
future research to investigate whether the three-dimen-
sional intellectual capital scale can also be generalized
for other industries and countries. Further, researchers
can use this intellectual capital scale for theory devel-
opment, model testing, and scale refinement with addi-
tion of other dimensions like organizational capital,
process capital, and customer capital as these are
not included in the present study. As suggested by
researchers such as Ahangar (2011) and Ahmad and
Musharaf (2011), the inter-relationships of intellectual
capital with other factors like competitive advantage,
innovation, and learning culture can also be taken into
consideration in future to comprehend the concept of
intellectual capital.
