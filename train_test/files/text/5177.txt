The Illusion of Moral Superiority
Ben M. Tappin1 and Ryan T. McKay1
Abstract
Most people strongly believe they are just, virtuous, and moral; yet regard the average person as distinctly less so. This invites
accusations of irrationality in moral judgment and perception--but direct evidence of irrationality is absent. Here, we quantify this
irrationality and compare it against the irrationality in other domains of positive self-evaluation. Participants (N ¼ 270) judged
themselves and the average person on traits reflecting the core dimensions of social perception: morality, agency, and sociability.
Adapting new methods, we reveal that virtually all individuals irrationally inflated their moral qualities, and the absolute and
relative magnitude of this irrationality was greater than that in the other domains of positive self-evaluation. Inconsistent with
prevailing theories of overly positive self-belief, irrational moral superiority was not associated with self-esteem. Taken together,
these findings suggest that moral superiority is a uniquely strong and prevalent form of ``positive illusion,'' but the underlying
function remains unknown.

Most people believe they are just, virtuous, and moral. These
beliefs demand scientific attention for several reasons. For one,
in contrast to other domains of positive self-belief, they likely
contribute to the severity of human conflict. When opposing
sides are convinced of their own righteousness, escalation of
violence is more probable, and the odds of resolution are omi-
nously low (Pinker, 2011; Skitka, Bauman, & Sargis, 2005).
Moreover, self-righteousness is not confined to conflict situa-
tions; a substantial majority of individuals believe themselves
to be morally superior to the average person. Compared to
``above average'' beliefs in other domains (e.g., see Alicke &
Govorun, 2005), distinct lines of evidence suggest widespread
moral superiority may be particularly irrational--yet, direct
empirical support for this is absent. In the present study, we
quantify this irrationality. We find that moral superiority repre-
sents a uniquely strong and prevalent instance of ``positive
illusion'' (Taylor & Brown, 1988).
Moral Superiority
In their seminal review, Taylor and Brown (1988) advanced the
case for a triad of positive illusions--the first of which was
overly positive self-evaluation. They regarded these phenom-
ena as reflecting inaccuracies in social perception, persisting
as a result of their beneficial effect upon human well-being.
The common means of inferring the presence of positive illu-
sions is to ask individuals how they compare with respect to the
average person along some dimension. This method consis-
tently reveals that an implausibly high number of people
believe that they are above average--a phenomenon dubbed
the ``better-than-average effect'' (Alicke & Govorun, 2005;
or ``self-enhancement,'' Sedikides & Gregg, 2008). Although
this phenomenon emerges across a range of characteristics, the
magnitude of self-enhancement is strongest for moral qualities.
Across four studies, Alicke, Vredenburg, Hiatt, and
Govorun (2001) reported evidence that desirable moral traits,
such as honesty and trustworthiness, are associated with the
largest difference between judgments of the self and the aver-
age person. A similar pattern has been found for undesirable
traits--clearly moralized terms such as ``liar'' produce the
strongest asymmetries in self-other judgment (Alicke, Klotz,
Breitenbecher, Yurak, & Vredenburg, 1995). Multiple studies
converge on the same conclusion: Magnitude of self-
enhancement is stronger for moral characteristics--like hon-
esty--than for other desirable but nonmoral characteristics,
such as competence (Brown, 2012; Mo
¨ller & Savyon, 2003),
wisdom (Zell & Alicke, 2011), ambition (Alicke, Vredenburg,
Hiatt, & Govorun, 2001), and intelligence (Van Lange & Sedi-
kides, 1998). Moreover, whereas self-enhancement of various
nonmoral traits may diminish with age, the self-other

asymmetry for moral traits remains consistently large through-
out the life span (Zell & Alicke, 2011). Such is the extent of this
phenomenon that violent criminals consider themselves more
moral than law-abiding citizens living in the community (Sedi-
kides, Meek, Alicke, & Taylor, 2014).
The Ubiquity of Virtue
To compound the paradox of widespread moral superiority,
most individuals appear assured of the loftiness of their virtu-
ous qualities (relative to their other qualities). Desirable moral
traits are perceived to be highly descriptive of the self--more
so than other desirable but nonmoral traits. For example, in a
vast cross-national sample of 187,957 participants spanning
11 European countries, Gebauer, Wagner, Sedikides, and
Neberich (2013) reported that, of two distinct trait dimensions,
the one comprising desirable moral terms such as ``faithful''
and ``honest'' was judged as more self-descriptive than the one
which included nonmoral terms such as ``clever'' and ``wise.''
Additional cross-cultural data converge on the same conclu-
sion. In a similarly sized sample comprising participants from
54 countries and all 50 U.S. states, the moral characteristics of
``honesty'' and ``fairness'' were ranked consistently highly in
individuals' self-description (Park, Peterson, & Seligman,
2006). Wojciszke and Bialobrzeska (2014) compared two dis-
tinct trait dimensions, one including desirable moral charac-
teristics--such as ``fair,'' honest, and ``loyal''--and the
other including desirable nonmoral characteristics such as
``intelligent,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and ``logical.'' Across six
diverse cultures, they found that the traits in the former
dimension were judged to be more descriptive of the self (also
see Wojciszke, Baryla, Parzuchowski, Szymkow, & Abele,
2011). Indeed, numerous studies have shown that individuals
believe they possess, on average, more honesty and
trustworthiness than any other characteristic, including intel-
ligence, modesty, friendliness, determination, and indepen-
dence (e.g., Alicke et al., 2001; Brown, 2012; Sedikides,
1993). Finally, individuals anticipate that, whereas desirable
nonmoral traits will come and go throughout the course of
one's life, they will always possess desirable moral traits
(Ybarra, Park, Stanik, & Lee, 2012).
The Paradox
Taken together, the preceding lines of evidence present a strik-
ing asymmetry. Most people consider themselves paragons of
virtue; yet few individuals perceive this abundance of virtue
in others. As a descriptive phenomenon, this pattern is perhaps
unsurprising. Previous research indicates that self-
enhancement emerges most strongly for traits that are both
desirable and ambiguous (e.g., Dunning, Meyerowitz, & Holz-
berg, 1989)--a product of the increased degrees of freedom for
self-favoring construal of the traits in question. That self-
enhancement is strongest in the moral domain is directly con-
sistent with this evidence. Morality traits are highly desirable
(Van Lange & Sedikides, 1998) yet difficult to check against
reality (Alicke & Govorun, 2005), and there is significant
variability in the behaviors considered indicative of a ``moral''
person (Graham, Meindl, Beall, Johnson, & Zhang, 2016).
However, normatively speaking, moral superiority may
reflect significant incoherence in social judgment and percep-
tion. To illustrate why, consider a typical individual, Jane,
tasked with judging the morality of herself and the average per-
son. The reviewed evidence suggests Jane construes her moral-
ity in very positive terms--in part by capitalizing on trait
ambiguity. In contrast, her judgment of the average person is
decidedly less positive. This suggests that Jane foregoes the
corollary that high trait ambiguity permits a majority of others
to be equally as moral as she, albeit in their own idiosyncratic
ways (Dunning et al., 1989). Unfortunately, Jane's double stan-
dard incurs a cost to her judgment accuracy. Self-judgments act
as valid cues to what the average person is like--justified by
the fact that most people are in the majority most of the time.
Indeed, appropriately gauging the prototypicality of one's own
characteristics improves accuracy in judgments of ill-defined
others (e.g., Hoch, 1987; Krueger & Chen, 2014); neglecting
this prototypicality may thus amount to a failure of inductive
reasoning (Krueger, Freestone, & MacInnis, 2013). Conse-
quently, given that most people consider themselves highly
moral, if Jane strongly self-enhances her morality--as the evi-
dence indicates she will--this may also compromise the accu-
racy of her social perception.
The Present Study
There is mounting support for the idea that moral superiority is
an especially potent positive illusion. However, the term
``illusion'' specifically implies irrationality in belief--an accu-
sation that lacks decisive evidence (Krueger & Wright, 2011).
Prevailing measures of self-enhancement do not discriminate
between the rational (i.e., defensible) and irrational (indefensi-
ble) components of self-enhancement (Heck & Krueger, 2015).
To our knowledge, there have been no attempts to quantify and
compare the irrationality in moral self-enhancement with that
in other domains of self-enhancement. The present study
addresses this lacuna. We adapt a novel method (Heck & Krue-
ger, 2015) to isolate and quantify the irrational component of
moral superiority and compare it against the irrationality in
other domains of self-enhancement. We also examine whether
the irrational component of moral superiority is associated with
well-being, as the prevailing conception of positive illusions
(Taylor & Brown, 1988), and previous research (e.g., Campbell,
Rudich, & Sedikides, 2002), would predict.
Method
Participants
We sought to recruit 265 participants via Amazon's Mechani-
cal Turk (www.mturk.com) to achieve greater than 90% power
to detect a small effect of d ¼ 0.2 (at a ¼ .05) in our primary
analyses of variance and paired samples t-tests. We over-
recruited by 15% to account for data exclusions, bringing our
624 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(6)
collected sample size to 308 participants (153 male; Mage
¼
37.81, SD ¼ 11.77). Data from 20 participants were excluded
from all analyses due to failing at least one attention check
(8 participants) and/or providing incomplete responses
(15 participants). A further 18 participants were excluded from
the final regression analyses due to lack of variation in judg-
ments of the self, the average person, and/or trait desirability--
leaving a sample size of 270 for the primary analyses.
Procedure and Materials
Procedure. After providing online consent, participants were
presented with a list of 30 traits, comprising 10 trait terms each
for the dimensions morality, agency, and sociability. They
were asked to judge the extent to which each trait described
(a) themselves, (b) the average person, and (c) the social desir-
ability of each trait. Participants rated all 30 traits according to
either (a), (b), or (c), before moving onto the next set of ratings,
and the order of these three sets of judgments was counterba-
lanced across participants (any order effects were presumed
to be trivial). The presentation order of the traits themselves
was randomized across each rating set and participant. Rating
judgments for the self and the average person were provided
on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so). Social desir-
ability judgments were also provided on a 7-point scale, rang-
ing from À3 (very undesirable) to þ3 (very desirable).
Following the trait judgments, participants completed four
other measures (counterbalanced, detailed below) and provided
simple demographic information.
Traits. The core dimensions of social perception, communion/
warmth and agency/competence, are associated with traits
related to benevolence and ability, respectively (Fiske, Cuddy,
& Glick, 2007). Recently, it has been empirically demonstrated
that the communion/warmth dimension is comprised of distinct
morality and sociability components--the former describing
honesty, trustworthiness, and sincerity, the latter warmth,
friendliness, and likeability (e.g., Goodwin, Piazza, & Rozin,
2014). Thus, drawing upon a comprehensive norming study
of trait adjectives (Goodwin et al., 2014, Experiment 1), we
selected five positive (desirable) and five negative (undesir-
able) traits for each of the three dimensions morality, agency,
and sociability; providing a total of 30 traits for the present
study. Traits were carefully chosen to minimize dimension
overlap (see the Supplemental Online Material for details of the
trait selection procedure).
Other measures. Self-esteem was measured using the 10-item
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). Three addi-
tional measures were included but were not part of the primary
analyses and are thus not reported further in the main text (see
Supplemental Online Material for relevant analyses). These
were the 16-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory (Ames,
Rose, & Anderson, 2006), and the moral identity (Aquino &
Reed, 2002), and need to belong (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &
Schreindorfer, 2013) scales.
Projection-based index of self-enhancement. Prevailing mea-
sures of self-enhancement conflate defensible (or ``rational'')
self-enhancement with indefensible (or ``irrational'') self-
enhancement (Krueger & Wright, 2011). For instance, given
that individuals have more information about themselves than
about others, they will be relatively less certain about what the
average person is like. As a consequence, judgments of the
average person are likely to be less extreme than self-
judgments; with the former tending toward the midpoint of the
judgment scale (Moore & Small, 2007). The corollary is that
observed self-other differences in trait judgment--ostensibly
indicative of self-enhancement--may actually reflect ration-
ally cautious judgments made under uncertainty. In order to
estimate the irrational component of self-enhancement, it is
therefore necessary to first account for this rational component.
To this end, we adapted the Social Projection Index (SPI) of
self-enhancement (Heck & Krueger, 2015).
To estimate what proportion of conventional self-
enhancement may be considered rational, the SPI first asks how
an individual might infer the characteristics of the average
person. One strategy is to draw upon a relative abundance of
self-knowledge. Indeed, in the absence of salient diagnostic
information about others, one's own characteristics act as cues
to what others are like. Decades of research has shown that
individuals readily project their own characteristics onto others
and that this process--termed social projection--typically
increases accuracy in judgments of what unknown others are
like (for reviews, see Krueger, 2007; Robbins & Krueger,
2005). However, projection may be too weak or too strong--
individuals may underperceive or overperceive the similarity
between themselves and others, respectively. Somewhere in
between is the optimal amount of projection, which tracks the
actual similarity among people. While individuals are unlikely
to perceive this similarity with complete precision, the
researcher can. The similarity may be quantified as the correla-
tion between individual self-judgments and the average of all
self-judgments in the group (Hoch, 1987; Krueger et al.,
2013). This correlation ``coefficient of similarity'' thus
describes how typical of the average a particular individual
is, and, importantly, a fully rational perceiver may weight their
self-judgments by this coefficient to maximize accuracy in
their judgments of what the average person is like (Hoch,
1987; Krueger & Chen, 2014). Computation of the coefficients
of similarity, therefore, provides a rational benchmark against
which to evaluate individuals' observed self-enhancement
(i.e., the difference between their self-judgments and their
judgments of the average person).
To illustrate, consider the following example. An individual
whose self-judgments are highly typical of the average should
project more, as their self-judgments are highly diagnostic of
what the average person is like. In contrast, an individual
whose self-judgments are highly atypical of the average should
project less, as their self-judgments are only weakly diagnostic

of what the average person is like. In the former case, judg-
ments of the average person are expected to be minimally
regressive with respect to self-judgments--resulting in a
smaller latitude for defensible (rational) self-enhancement. In
contrast, in the latter case, judgments of the average person are
expected to be relatively more regressive with respect to self-
judgments--resulting in a larger latitude for defensible
(rational) self-enhancement. Crucially, in either case, the SPI
explicitly models the fact that informational uncertainty man-
dates that a proportion of conventional self-enhancement be
considered rational--avoiding the pitfall of earlier measures.
Computationally speaking, the logic outlined above allows
researchers to generate rational predicted judgments of the
average person, by weighting individuals' self-judgments
by their respective coefficient of similarity. As Heck and
Krueger (2015) point out however, this conceptualizes self-
enhancement as diminishment of others. Alternatively, it is
possible to reverse-predict what self-judgments should have
been, if rationally projecting individuals derived their empiri-
cally observed judgments of the average person from their
self-judgments. These reverse-predicted self-judgments may
be labeled inferred self-judgments, and they yield a more con-
ceptually appropriate interpretation of self-enhancement as
positive self-inflation.
Determiningthe rational andirrationalcomponentsofconven-
tional self-enhancement thus requires self-judgments, judgments
of the average person, and computed inferred self-judgments.
Then, in a final step, the SPI exploits the empirical observation
that most individuals possess a positive self-image; ascribing
positive traits more readily to themselves than to others (and vice
versa for negative traits). Accordingly, self-enhancement is
modeled as the relationship between trait desirability and trait
judgment,1 meaning that (a) conventional self-enhancement is
given as the difference between how well trait desirability pre-
dicts self-judgments compared to how well it predicts judgments
of the average person, (b) the rational component of self-
enhancement is the difference between how well trait desirability
predicts inferred self-judgments compared to how well it predicts
judgments of the average person, and finally, (c) the irrational
component of self-enhancement is the difference between how
well trait desirability predicts inferred self-judgments compared
to how well it predicts actual self-judgments.
Results
Descriptives
Table 1 displays the list of 30 traits, their mean self (S), average
person (or ``other,'' O), and desirability (D) judgments, as well
as the respective domain reliability coefficients. Table 2 dis-
plays the zero-order correlations among mean self, other, and
desirability judgments for each trait domain.
Rational and Irrational Self-Enhancement
To compute the rational and irrational components of self-
enhancement, we first calculated the similarity between
individual self-judgments and the average of all self-
judgments in the group (i.e., the coefficients of similarity for
each participant). Thus, for each participant, we regressed the
average self-judgments made by all participants for the traits
in a given dimension onto the self-judgments of the focal par-
ticipant for the traits in that dimension. Estimating unique coef-
ficients for each dimension acknowledges that individuals may
be more similar on some dimensions compared to others. We
thus obtained three coefficients of similarity and their corre-
sponding intercepts for each participant. As outlined above, the
SPI posits that these coefficients may be used to weight S judg-
ments to generate rational predicted O judgments, P. P is thus
given as:

However, following Heck and Krueger (2015), we instead
computed inferred self-judgments, I, by rewriting the
regression equation:
I ¼

We computed I judgments for each trait over all partici-
pants, using the mean2 coefficient of similarity and intercept
corresponding to the traits' respective dimension:

Thus, at this stage, each participant had four sets of
judgments for the 30 traits: Their empirically observed S, O,
and D judgments and the new I judgments computed according
to the method outline above. For each dimension, we then
regressed S, O, and I on D judgments over each participant.
We also regressed O on S judgments to cross-check the
assumption of social projection (a positive association
constitutes evidence for social projection; Krueger, 2007).
Table 3 displays the relevant means. We first draw attention
to the evidence of social projection; across all trait dimensions,
S judgments positively predicted O judgments (mean bSO
¼
.23­.30). We then examined whether social projection
increased judgment accuracy. For each dimension, we com-
puted an accuracy index by correlating other judgments with
average self-judgments over all participants and traits corre-
sponding to that dimension. Correlating this index with magni-
tude of social projection revealed the expected pattern.
Accuracy of other judgments was positively associated with
social projection across all trait dimensions, r(268) ¼ .63­
.85, all ps < .001. As projection increased, accuracy of other
judgments improved. This is consistent with previous research
(Hoch, 1987; Krueger & Chen, 2014) and confirms the validity
of the methodological approach taken in the present study.
Next, we note the expected observation of conventional self-
enhancement. Across all dimensions, trait desirability pre-
dicted self-judgments (mean bSD
) better than it predicted other
judgments (mean bOD
); for morality (.76 vs. .21), t(269) ¼
22.08, p < .001, d ¼ 1.34 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.18,
1.51], agency (.70 vs. .21), t(269) ¼ 18.75, p < .001, d ¼
1.14 [0.99, 1.29], and sociability (.56 vs. .30), t(269) ¼
10.21, p < .001, d ¼ 0.62 [0.49, 0.75]. To compare across
dimensions, we computed a difference measure of conven-
tional self-enhancement as bSD
À bOD
and conducted a
repeated measures analysis of variance with dimension as the
single factor, F(2, 538) ¼ 71.70, p < .001, Zp
2 ¼ .21. Conven-
tional self-enhancement was greater for morality (.54) than
agency (.49), t(269) ¼ 2.01, p ¼ .045, d ¼ 0.12 [0.00, 0.24],
and sociability (.26), t(269) ¼ 11.04, p < .001, d ¼ 0.67
[0.54, 0.80]. Agency was also greater than sociability, t(269)
¼ 8.42, p < .001, d ¼ 0.51 [0.39, 0.64].
What proportion of conventional self-enhancement is
accounted for by rational and irrational components? To deter-
mine the rational component, we examined how well trait
desirability predicted inferred-self judgments (mean bID
)
compared to other judgments (mean bOD
). Sociability had the
largest magnitude of rationally defensible self-enhancement
(.57 vs. .30), t(269) ¼ 14.33, p < .001, d ¼ 0.87 [0.73, 1.01].
The magnitude for agency was substantially smaller (.28 vs.
21), but still nontrivial, t(269) ¼ 3.19, p ¼ .002, d ¼ 0.19
[0.07, 0.31]. In contrast, the rational component of self-

enhancement in the moral domain was trivial in size (.25
vs. .21), t(269) ¼ 1.72, p ¼ .087, d ¼ 0.10 [À0.02, 0.22].
This indicates that irrational self-enhancement is strongest in
the moral domain. Indeed, this was the case. Examining how well
trait desirability predicted actual self-judgments (mean bSD
)
compared to inferred self-judgments (mean bID
) revealed the
largest discrepancy for morality (.76 vs. .25), t(269) ¼ 18.17, p
< .001, d ¼ 1.11 [0.95, 1.26]. Although smaller, agency com-
prised a substantial magnitude of irrational self-enhancement
(.70 vs. .28), t(269) ¼ 12.97, p < .001, d ¼ 0.79 [0.65, 0.93]. In
stark contrast, there was no evidence for irrationality in self-
enhancement of sociability traits--desirability predicted self and
inferredself-judgmentsequallywell(.56vs..57),t(269)¼ À0.32,
p ¼ .750, d ¼ À0.02 [À0.14, 0.10]. In other words, the average
magnitude of conventional self-enhancement along the dimen-
sion of sociability was fully accounted for by rational
projection-based other judgment. As before, we compared irra-
tionality across dimensions by computing a difference measure,
bSD
À bID
, and conducting a repeated measures analysis of var-
iance with dimension as the single factor, F(2, 538) ¼ 187.19, p
< .001, Zp
2 ¼ .41. Morality (.50) comprised the greatest magni-
tude of irrational self-enhancement, compared with agency
(.42), t(269) ¼ 3.33, p ¼ .001, d ¼ 0.20 [0.08, 0.32], and sociabil-
ity(À.01), t(269) ¼ 18.04,p < .001, d ¼ 1.10[0.95,1.25]. Agency
was also greater than sociability, t(269) ¼ 13.25, p < .001, d ¼
0.81 [0.67, 0.94]. The complete pattern is displayed in Figure 1
as the percentage of conventional self-enhancement magnitude
accounted for by rational and irrational components.
Corroborating the analysis of magnitude, the data also show
that more individuals irrationally self-enhanced (bSD
> bID
) for
moral traits (243, 90% of sample), compared with agency traits
(218, 81%), w2(270) ¼ 14.05, p < .001, and sociability traits
(134, 50%), w2(270) ¼ 103.22, p < .001. Individuals were also
more likely to irrationally self-enhance for agency traits than
for sociability traits, w2(270) ¼ 73.29, p < .001.
Ubiquity of Virtue
What accounts for the strength and prevalence of irrationality
in moral self-enhancement? Consistent with the ubiquity of
virtue, prototypicality of individual self-judgments was highest
in the moral domain--self-judgments tracked average self-
judgments better for morality traits (mean b ¼ .85) than agency
traits (.73), t(269) ¼ 5.96, p < .001, d ¼ 0.36 [0.24, 0.49], and
sociability traits (.52), t(269) ¼ 12.94, p < .001, d ¼ 0.79 [0.65,
0.92]. In other words, as expected, the strongest consensus in
self-judgment emerged in the moral domain. Importantly how-
ever, strength of projection to others was not adequately
adjusted to reflect this consensus. Projection from self to other
was no stronger in the moral domain (mean bSO
¼ .25) than in
the agency domain (.23), t(269) ¼ 1.51, p ¼ .133, d ¼ 0.09
[À0.03, 0.21], and was in fact weaker than projection in the
domain of sociability (.30), t(269) ¼ 3.07, p ¼ .002, d ¼
0.19 [0.07, 0.31]. Thus, trait desirability predicted moral self-
judgments to a much greater extent than it predicted moral
other judgments, and, taken in conjunction with the ubiquity
of virtue, this discrepancy is classified as largely irrational.
Inaccuracy and Well-Being
The prevailing conception of positive illusions (Taylor &
Brown, 1988) encompasses two central claims about strongly
positive self-evaluations. The first is that they reflect an inaccu-
rate perception of reality (i), and the second is that this inaccu-
racy contributes to well-being (ii).
To examine (i), for each dimension we correlated the previ-
ously computed accuracy index with magnitude of irrational
self-enhancement in that dimension. As expected, accuracy
was negatively associated with irrational self-enhancement;
for morality, r(268) ¼ À.73, p < .001, agency, r(268) ¼
À.71, p < .001, and sociability r(268) ¼ À.65, p < .001. The
aforementioned accuracy index denotes discrimination accu-
racy only; thus we also examined bias--that is, absolute discre-
pancies in judgment (Epley & Dunning, 2006). For each
dimension, we computed a discrepancy index of accuracy as
the average difference between other judgments and the
average of all self-judgments over traits and participants. We
entered these scores into a repeated measures analysis of var-
iance with dimension as the single factor, F(2, 538) ¼
122.67, p < .001, Zp
2 ¼ .31. Judgments of others' morality
(1.56) were the most discrepant compared with agency
(1.40), t(269) ¼ 5.55, p < .001, d ¼ 0.34 [0.22, 0.46] and socia-
bility (1.10), t(269) ¼ 15.11, p < .001, d ¼ 0.92 [0.78, 1.06]
judgments. The most inaccurate judgments of others occurred
in the domain with the strongest irrationality in self-
enhancement. Thus, both accuracy analyses support claim (i).
Moving onto (ii), we conducted partial correlations between
irrational self-enhancement and self-esteem--controlling for
the confounding influence of the corresponding rational, and
the other dimensions' rational and irrational, components of
self-enhancement. Magnitude of irrational self-enhancement
in the moral domain was not associated with self-esteem,
r(263) ¼ À.02, p ¼ .701, whereas irrational self-
enhancement in the agency and sociability domains was posi-
tively correlated with self-esteem, r(263) ¼ .30, p < .001 and
r(263) ¼ .25, p < .001, respectively.

Discussion
The present study revealed two key findings. The first was that
moral superiority comprised a substantial irrational compo-
nent; the absolute and relative magnitude of which was greater
than that observed in other domains of self-enhancement.
Indeed, virtually all individuals irrationally inflated their moral
qualities. The second key finding was that, unlike the other
domains of self-enhancement, irrational moral superiority was
not associated with self-esteem. Taken together, these results
suggest a uniquely strong and prevalent illusion of moral super-
iority and raise intriguing questions about the function of this
phenomenon.
The irrationality of moral superiority was borne out of the
ubiquity of virtue--almost everyone reported a strong posi-
tive moral self-image--and individuals' ignorance of this ubi-
quity when making judgments of the average person. Indeed,
neglecting the prototypicality--and thus cue validity--of
one's own self-judgments may signal an error in inductive
reasoning (Krueger et al., 2013). Of course, self-judgments
themselves may not accurately reflect genuine moral charac-
ter--for example, compared to behavior (Back & Vazire,
2012). However, given the substantial degrees of freedom in
what constitutes moral behavior (Alicke & Govorun, 2005;
Graham et al., 2016), it seems probable that claims of positive
moral character are equally legitimate (or illegitimate) for a
large majority of people. In most cases, it would be difficult
to make the argument that one moral self-image is more gen-
uine than another. A fallacy thus arises when individuals do
not apply to others the same degrees of freedom they invoke
in their moral evaluation of themselves (Dunning et al., 1989).
Insofar as this fallacy compromises the accuracy of social
judgment and perception, it may be deemed erroneous (Heck
& Krueger, 2015).
Despite finding strong support for the illusory nature of
moral superiority, we found that the irrational component of
moral self-enhancement was not correlated with self-esteem.
This is inconsistent with the prevailing conception of positive
illusions (Taylor & Brown, 1988) and is especially pronounced
given that self-esteem was positively associated with magni-
tude of irrational superiority in both the agency and sociability
domains. Furthermore, our result is at odds with previous evi-
dence that high self-esteem individuals possess a stronger
belief in moral superiority (Campbell et al., 2002). However,
the latter inconsistency may be accounted for by measurement
differences. Campbell and colleagues assessed superiority
using a ``comparative'' measure, that is, they directly asked
individuals how much better than average they are. These mea-
sures correlate most strongly with self-judgments, and only
weakly with judgments of others (Klar & Giladi, 1999; Krueger
& Wright, 2011)--the corollary being that the measure used by
Campbell and colleagues may have assessed (absolute) moral
self-image rather than (relative) moral superiority. Support for
this proposition is recovered from our own data; self-esteem
did positively correlate with moral self-image (morality bSD
),
r(268) ¼ .34, p < .001.
As an indicator of well-being, self-reported self-esteem is
far from exhaustive; it is necessary to measure well-being by
more objective means to decisively test the theory of positive
illusions (Heck & Krueger, 2015). Nevertheless, the lack of a
relationship between self-esteem and the irrational component
of moral superiority invites speculation as to why this illusion
is so pervasive (cf. Taylor & Brown, 1988). Although a full dis-
cussion is beyond the scope of this article, we note that, from
other perspectives, moral superiority may not be considered
irrational at all (cf. Boudry, Vlerick, & McKay, 2015). For
example, error management theorists (e.g., Haselton & Buss,
2000) might view underestimating the morality of others as
quite rational. Mistaking another person as trustworthy, when
in fact they are not, may be associated with greater fitness costs
than the reverse error. Under such conditions, individuals may
tolerate decreased judgment accuracy for gains made else-
where (Fetchenhauer & Dunning, 2006; but see McKay &
Efferson, 2010). On this account, moral superiority may per-
sist, in part, as a function of the adaptive value of presuming
modest morality in unknown others.
The findings of the present study are limited in that they do
not reveal the behavioral consequences of an illusion of moral
superiority. While we advance the case that moral superiority is
dubious partly because ``morality'' may be defined by many
different behaviors (Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Graham et al.,
2016), it would be practically useful to know whether the illu-
sion of moral superiority predicts certain types of moral beha-
vior--for example, dishonesty for monetary gain. On the basis
of existing research there is scope for competing predictions.
Given the evidence that affirmation of moral image ``licenses''
subsequent immoral behavior (Blanken, van de Ven, & Zeelen-
berg, 2015), feeling morally superior may promote greater
dishonesty. Alternatively, to the extent that people value
belief-behavior consistency (Festinger, 1962), moral superior-
ity may be associated with a greater likelihood of honest beha-
vior. We defer to future research to test these hypotheses.
The belief that one is morally superior to the average person
appears robust and widespread. Our examination of this belief
revealed substantial irrationality beyond that observed in other
domains of positive self-evaluation. On this basis, moral super-
iority represents a uniquely strong and prevalent form of posi-
tive illusion.

Notes
1. This index of self-enhancement is psychometrically equivalent to a
conventional difference-score index (see Heck & Krueger, 2015).
2. While a more fine-grained approach is to generate inferred self-
judgments using the participants' idiosyncratic coefficients of
similarity--rather than the mean--these different approaches yield
equivalent results overall (see, e.g., Heck & Krueger, 2015).
