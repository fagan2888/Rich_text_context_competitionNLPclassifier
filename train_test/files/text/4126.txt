Abstract
Strong professionals who influence the development of healthcare services have domi-
nated healthcare organizations for many years. However, this dominance has been
challenged recently through patient involvement. One method of achieving patient
involvement is experience-based co-design (EBCD), in which patients and healthcare
professionals work together to improve care. Patient involvement has considerable
potential, but also presents certain challenges. This article addresses these challenges
using experiences from patients and healthcare professionals who participated in two
action research projects that aimed to improve patient experienced quality using EBCD
in pediatric care. The paper shows that patient involvement in quality improvements can
challenge the traditional roles of professionals and patients by new roles as
co-designers. The role as co-designer embraces new perspectives for healthcare pro-
fessionals that force them to step out of their comfort zone. Accordingly, healthcare
professionals are able to view patients as equal partners in improvement work.
Reflecting dialogues during the projects offered eye-opening stories for patients and
healthcare professionals that enabled them to construct a common picture of care. The
contribution of this study is strengthening earlier research that argues that an action
research approach can strengthen important values for successful EBCD projects: equal
partnerships, new roles, and dialogue. The findings show that the combination of EBCD
and action research is a promising approach to address the challenges of patient involve-
ment in healthcare improvement.

Introduction
Healthcare professionals often think they have unique expert knowledge that will
improve care processes and create value for patients (Bate & Robert, 2006). Based
on experiences from joint improvement efforts in service industries in general
(Carbonell, Rodri´guez-Escudero, & Pujari, 2009; Witell, Kristensson,
Gustafsson, & Lo
¨ fgren, 2011), patients are also likely to be important resources
in healthcare improvement by contributing knowledge from their personal
experiences.
However, patient involvement practices are often problematic and have there-
fore not been widespread in healthcare (Luxford, Gelb Safran, & Delblanco, 2011).
Strong professional dominance in healthcare has been the main explanation for
difficulties in involving patients in ongoing care activities or improvements
(Luxford et al., 2011). The presence of strong professionals such as physicians,
nurses, etc. in healthcare is an advantage, in that they bring the benefit of their
knowledge, but also a challenge because it can be hard for management to influence
them (Freidson, 2001; Scott, Ruef, Mendel, & Caronna, 2000). The legitimacy of
medical professions in society is based on trust that professionals always put the
best interests of the patient first (Wilensky, 1964). However, researchers have also
argued that professionals actively guard their arenas and positions by ensuring that
they dominate their knowledge domain, precluding other actors from challenging
their decisions (Abbott, 1988; Freidson, 2001). Allowing patients to access this
knowledge domain challenge the status and identity of professionals (Andersson,
2015). Thus, a professional logic has two competing characteristics--service ideal
and professional dominance (Freidson, 2001; Wilensky, 1964)--that are related,
but have different implications. The service ideal means that a professional, acting
altruistically, always works in the best interest of the client. Professional dominance
is the egocentric belief that only a professional knows what is best for a client/
patient (Liff & Andersson, 2011). These competing characteristics explain why joint
improvement efforts involving patients and healthcare professionals are a natural
evolution based on the altruistic service ideal in professional logic, but also chal-
lenge the very core of professional logic considering egocentric professional
dominance.
Despite several examples of mutual gains with positive and sustainable improve-
ment results, the clash between these logics entails inevitable challenges
when healthcare professionals and patients are involved in joint improvements
(Bate & Robert, 2006; Gustavsson, 2014; Iedema et al., 2010; Pickles, Hide, &
Maher, 2008). New roles and approaches are required for both healthcare profes-
sionals and patients. Luxford, Gelb Safran, and Delblanco (2011, p. 513) argued
2 Action Research 0(0)
that one barrier to moving from a ``provider focus'' to a ``patient focus'' is chan-
ging ``the mindset of employees.'' Staff may also feel that involving patients in
improvements is time-consuming and competes with daily work tasks (Donetto,
Tsinakas, & Robert, 2014; Larkin, Boden, & Newton, 2015).
One method of involving patients in healthcare improvement is experience-
based co-design (EBCD), in which healthcare professionals and patients use their
own experiences as pivotal points of departure for developmental efforts in order to
improve care (Bate & Robert, 2006, 2007). Internationally, EBCD has been
described as an action research (AR) method (Robert, 2013), even if it often is
used as an improvement method without research ambitions. In Sweden, where the
current study took place, EBCD has only been an improvement method.
Combining EBCD and AR means adding a research part to EBCD and also
taking advantage of AR's ability to support conditions that enable development
and change, such as equal power distribution between healthcare professionals and
patients as they jointly contribute knowledge to the healthcare system (Hughes,
2008; Koch & Kralik, 2006; Lifvergren, Huzzard, & Hellstro
¨ m, 2015). However
few studies have provided insight into the effects of combining EBCD and AR
(Bate & Robert, 2007).
In the present article, we address the challenges of patient involvement in health-
care quality improvements by describing experiences from patients and healthcare
professionals who collaborated in AR projects, by using EBCD in pediatric care
settings at a Swedish hospital. Involving patients in the research process results in
co-production of knowledge, sustainable change, and translation of knowledge
(Gillard, Simons, Turner, Lucock, & Edwards, 2012). However, few research
papers have explored the benefits of combining EBCD and AR, and studies on
EBCD have mainly been case studies that report outcomes from improvement
projects (see Bowen, Dearden, Wolstenholme, & Cobb, 2011; Boyd, McKernon,
Mullin, & Old, 2012; Tsianakas et al., 2012).
Previous research
This section includes a brief overview of previous research in the field of patient
involvement in improving healthcare and, more specifically, the EBCD method.
Patient involvement in healthcare improvements
Patient involvement is a central aspect of sustainable healthcare (Lifvergren et al.,
2015; Williamson, 2014) and may occur in several different ways. For example,
patients may take greater responsibility for their own care, for managing healthcare
services, and for improving the quality of care.
One step towards patient involvement may entail using patient experiences to
evaluate care as a basis for improvements executed by healthcare professionals
(Coulter, Locock, Ziebland, & Calabrese, 2014). Healthcare organizations have
gone a step further in recent years, emphasizing public and patient involvement
Gustavsson and Andersson 3
in service development and participation in decisions around one's own treatment
(Tritter & McCallum, 2006), which implies a view of active patients as co-produ-
cers of healthcare quality (Bate & Robert, 2006; Lengnick-Hall, Claycomb, & Inks,
2000; Robert et al., 2015).
There is a lack of research about improvement projects that involve patients
participating together with healthcare professionals. However, Crawford et al.
(2002) described how the experience of participating in joint improvements can
differ between patients and healthcare professionals. Patients welcomed the invita-
tion to participate and their self-esteem often improved as a result of their contri-
butions. However, they sometimes felt the process was unsatisfactory as it was not
intended to devolve power to patients, but to legitimize decisions made by health-
care professionals. In an additional study (Engstro
¨ m & Elg, 2015) the following
motives for patients to join were identified: restitution after poor treatment, desire
for contact with others, volunteerism, desire to make a contribution, or the enjoy-
ment of having a task to complete. Crawford et al. (2002) described that healthcare
professionals found the experience rewarding, but also described difficulties in their
relationship with patients; for instance, decision-making processes were slowed
down. However, organizations became more open to involving patients and the
projects had a general effect on organizational attitudes.
Bowen and Wright (2010) described further challenges, which included a conflict
between patient involvement and professional values and daily habits.
Furthermore, even when professionals were positive to patient involvement,
there was a gap between values and practice (Lord & Gale, 2014). Because
the experiences of healthcare professionals and patients can differ, a collaborative
approach is needed in order to capture as many areas of improvement as
possible (Gustavsson, 2014). In addition, if patients--who are the experts in
their own experiences--are given the opportunity to be involved in the health ser-
vice improvement and design, a shift may occur in expertise and, in turn, in the
power relations between patients and professionals (cf. Tritter & McCallum, 2006).
Accordingly, patient involvement in improvement work needs careful manage-
ment if it is to realize its full potential (Armstrong, Herbert, Aveling, Dixon-
Woods, & Martin, 2013; Crawford et al., 2002). Managers are often willing to
involve patients in improvement initiatives, but lack knowledge and experience
of how to do it (Andersson & Olheden, 2012; Bate & Robert, 2006; Iedema
et al., 2010). While it is important to use patients' unique experiences when striving
for higher healthcare quality, the challenges must be illuminated. Successful col-
laborative improvements in healthcare require courage to change the current roles
for patients and healthcare professionals.
Experience-based co-design
Bate and Robert (2007) developed the EBCD method in collaboration with the
NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. AR was used as an approach to
test new methods of involving patients in improvement efforts on equal terms with
4 Action Research 0(0)
healthcare professionals. The EBCD methodology was inspired by several research
approaches: participatory action research, user-centered design, learning theories,
and a narrative-based approach (Bate & Robert, 2007). In EBCD, healthcare
professionals and patients work together in four steps: capturing experiences,
understanding experiences, improvement, and follow-up (Bate & Robert, 2006,
2007; Tsianakas et al., 2012). During these phases, storytelling is a basic foundation
for improvements, and there are opportunities to engage in dialogue that supports
learning among individuals, groups, and organizations.
The first examples of EBCD in healthcare came from a head-and-neck cancer
clinic (Bate & Robert, 2006, 2007; Pickles et al., 2008). The method was subse-
quently used elsewhere, such as emergency health services (Iedema et al., 2010),
breast and lung cancer services (Boyd et al., 2012; Tsianakas et al., 2012), neonatal
care (Gustavsson, 2014), outpatient services for the elderly (Bowen et al., 2011),
and mental health (Larkin et al., 2015).
The results of such collaborative improvement projects included fast access to
reliable health advice, effective treatment delivered by trusted professionals,
involvement in decisions, respect for preferences, clear and comprehensible infor-
mation and support for self-care, and attention to physical and environmental
needs (Maher & Baxter, 2009). A collaborative approach can tackle both simple
and complex problems (Gustavsson, 2014). Even if the accomplishments are small,
several improvements simultaneously or within a relatively short time can produce
a vast shift in the entire experience and may lead to deeper, longer-term changes in
attitudes and behaviors (Robert et al., 2015).
According to Pickles, Hide, and Maher (2008), the EBCD methodology ensures
that healthcare professionals draw upon the experiences of patients and their
families in order to truly reflect on patient needs. These experiences help the par-
ticipants see their care pathway from different perspectives with an emotional
touch (Iedema et al., 2010). The EBCD methodology is a process in which
people who have everyday experiential knowledge combine with people who
have expert knowledge (specialist, discipline-based) and the two knowledge systems
enrich one another (Bate & Robert, 2007). Hence, the dynamic process is a complex
social intervention that has an impact that can be difficult to evaluate (Iedema
et al., 2010). Furthermore, the process depends on the participants' personal devel-
opment; changes in the healthcare professionals' motivation, skills, and self-con-
fidence; and the development of trust and new relationships between the various
participants (Donetto et al., 2014). The novelty of EBCD is that patients are
involved in all phases, not only sharing their experiences, but also positioned as
active partners with healthcare professionals (Tsianakas et al., 2012). If the
improvement process leads to new understandings, relationships, and engagement,
it can potentially support a more equal partnership between patients and health-
care professionals (Iedema et al., 2010).
Collaboration under these circumstances is challenging because few social or
discursive rules for co-design processes currently exist. For instance, the role of
improver has been reserved for healthcare professionals. Other challenges include
Gustavsson and Andersson 5
engaging people's commitment to the idea of collaborative improvements and
talking about their experiences. EBCD is sometimes seen as impractical because
the methodology (such as conducting interviews or making films) is time-consum-
ing and the corresponding number of improvements made may be relatively small
(Larkin et al., 2015; Robert, 2013).
Another challenge is that the EBCD approach shifts the focus from a strong
management orientation to a more user-centric organizational approach, which
may lead to promising future developmental directions (Bate & Robert, 2007).
EBCD as an AR approach
An AR approach may strengthen EBCD project outcomes by enhancing scientific
and ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority and increasing credibility
and participation (Payne et al., 2011). Iedema et al. (2010) suggested that EBCD
combined with AR is related to four discursive domains of co-design as: (i) a
deliberative process that engages patients and healthcare professionals, (ii) a reflex-
ive process, (iii) a research methodological capacity-building process, and (iv) a
dialogic process through which practical improvements can be consequential.
These domains, which arise when EBCD and AR are combined, align with the
process of knowledge development in AR that Reason and Torbert (2001)
described, which include cycles that generate experiential, presentational, propos-
itional, and practical knowledge. The four steps in EBCD: capturing experiences,
understanding experiences, improving, and following up (Bate & Robert, 2006) are
similar to the AR cycle described by Coghlan and Brannick (2008) (see Table 1).
Even though there are similarities between EBCD and AR there are benefits of
the combination. One is the reflection that occurs through AR that may not be
found in ordinary improvement projects using EBCD. A reflection process that
goes beyond the actual project, when the research process continues. In addition,
each step in the EBCD process can be strengthened by the experiential learning
cycle: experiencing, reflection, interpreting, and then taking action (Coghlan &
Brannick, 2008). Reflective inquiry in AR can be from first-, second-, and third-
person perspectives (Bradbury, 2013; Coghlan & Brannick, 2008; Reason &
Bradbury, 2009; Reason & Torbert, 2001). First-person inquiry can be individual
reflections on ``. . . changing practices, ways of thinking and quality of attention''
(Torbert & Taylor, 2008, p. 240) and is vital for developing critical subjectivity
(Burgess, Pirkis, & Coombs, 2006). Second-person inquiry entails collective
learning within a group of people, such as organizational learning, and third-
person inquiry concerns the theoretical contributions to academia (Torbert &
Taylor, 2008).
Method
The research approach was based on AR and the study design was inductive and
qualitative. The authors sought to analyze and describe the experiences of
6 Action Research 0(0)
researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients who participated in projects that
combined EBCD and AR, and to address the challenges. Consequently, we chose a
qualitative approach for its relevance for analyzing practical implications, social
relations, and verbal and textual data, in an attempt to achieve an in-depth
understanding of the phenomenon (Flick, 2009).
Insider action researcher
During the first part of the AR process, the first author functioned mainly as a
method facilitator, guiding the teams through the EBCD phases. She had previ-
ously worked as a midwife in the organization, but here she took the role of an
insider action researcher (IAR), which presented both advantages and challenges.
On one hand, the author felt like an insider; someone who was familiar with the
organization, the other people working there, and had experience of caring for
children in neonatal care and children with diabetes. On the other hand, in her
role as an IAR, she felt as though the participants viewed her as an outsider,
someone who was no longer active in the workplace. She had to consider these
different roles in the reflective process. The most difficult aspect of this process was
abstracting the practical issues and experiences into theoretical reflections;
however, as a doctoral student, she could turn to her university supervisors for
assistance. It is not uncommon for someone conducting AR in his or her own
organization to feel confused about his or her different roles (De Guerre, 2002;
Coghlan & Brannick, 2008).
The second author participated in the diabetes project as the father of a daugh-
ter with diabetes, but then also took an active role during the writing of this paper.
As a researcher in healthcare management, he has experience in healthcare organ-
izations as an outsider, but has never worked in healthcare. He enrolled in the
project with no research plans, but after the completion of the improvement project
he was invited to participate in a joint writing project with the first author.
The second author recognized that the different roles he had played during the
process provided various perspectives. During the improvement project, the second
author was an insider to some extent, as a participating, committed father with the
goal of improving diabetes care for children. At the same time, he was an outsider
in the organization compared to the first author. During the writing process, the

second author was an insider in terms of parents' experiences, but an outsider in
leading the project compared to the first author. These various perspectives
enhanced the reflective capacity of the AR process.
Context
This paper is based on two AR projects in pediatric care processes in a Swedish
hospital. The pediatric division has worked with quality improvement processes for
approximately 10 years, but has only had modest patient involvement.
The first project, the neo project, was located in the neonatal care department
and involved healthcare professionals from the delivery, maternity, and neonatal
wards. The participants in the neo project included nurses, midwives, and nursing
assistants (n ¼ 7); and parents (n ¼ 5; two fathers and three mothers). The mothers
had two perspectives: that of a patient giving birth and that of a parent of a child
needing neonatal care.
The second project, the diabetes project, focused on care processes for children
with diabetes and involved the children's medical department and outpatient clinic.
Four fathers and three mothers of diabetic children participated, together with
seven healthcare professionals (three nurses, a physician, a psychologist, a social
worker, and an improvement facilitator).
The term ``patient'' as used in the two projects includes mothers as patients when
giving birth, their partners, and parents as spokespersons for their sick children.
Both projects lasted for about nine months and were inspired by EBCD, with
four phases: capturing, understanding, improving, and following up experiences
(Figure 1).
The outcomes, in the form of established improvements in the patient processes,
have been described in earlier publications (Gustavsson, 2014; Gustavsson et al.,
2016).
(1) Capturing experiences
The first phase was capturing the experiences, in which patients and healthcare
professionals were interviewed individually. The interviews, which lasted approxi-
mately 60­90 minutes, were recorded and transcribed. One open-ended question was
used: Can you describe your experiences of the care process, and how you felt in
various situations? The first author documented the mentioned situations and
related feelings in an ``emotional map,'' which consisted of a timeline that compiled
patient processes with experiences from all individual interviews. One map consisted
of patients' experiences and another of the healthcare professionals' experiences.
(2) Understanding experiences
The second phase was understanding the experiences. In this phase, all the
patients/relatives met to agree on the contents of the map and to highlight
8 Action Research 0(0)
common improvement areas. A similar meeting was held with all healthcare pro-
fessionals. Thereafter, both groups met for a reflection dialogue in which the two
groups listened to each other's experiences and identified ``touch points'' of joint
improvement areas. A list of prioritized improvement areas was developed
collaboratively.
(3) Improving experiences
During the third phase--improving--the healthcare professionals and patients/
relatives worked in groups or pairs to solve problems using the plan, do, study, act
(PDSA) cycle (Deming, 1986). Some participants met during the improvement
work and others met via telephone and/or e-mail. The improvement facilitator
supported this phase.
(4) Follow-up meeting
Approximately three months after the improvement phase started, a follow-up
meeting was held in which participants in the project groups presented the com-
pleted improvements. These meetings also included ward managers, who supported
the accomplishment of some improvements that required managerial involvement.
During the meeting, participants also reflected on the methodology and highlighted
the challenges and advantages they had experienced in the combined EBCD/AR
projects. After the meeting, the IAR distributed a questionnaire that captured the
participants' experiences of the EBCD/AR process in order to complement the
joint reflections.

In each phase of the EBCD approach, the IAR supported the reflective process
by asking questions to participating professionals and patients such as: What is
going on? How do we move forward? What did we learn?
Data collection and analysis
This paper draws upon three sources of empirical material: recorded and tran-
scribed reflective dialogues from all the group meetings in both projects, a ques-
tionnaire regarding the participants' experiences after project completion, and the
IAR's field notes during the project. Each project had six or seven group meetings
(see Table 2). The questionnaire was sent by mail to 28 recipients and had a
response rate of 61 percent. The questions were open-ended. Examples of questions
include: How was your experience of attending a project in which patients and
healthcare professionals collaborated? How do you think that the improvement
work was affected by the fact that patients and healthcare professionals
collaborated?
Data were analyzed in three stages. First, we used first-person inquiry, based on
the first author's reflections of being an IAR. The first author kept a personal diary
during the project. The notes in the diary contained different experiences during the
process that contributed to learning, e.g. situations that felt difficult or positive.
Second, we used qualitative analysis to examine transcripts of the group meetings
and the questionnaires (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004) and perform a second-
person inquiry of the project participants' reflections and learning. The texts
were read several times in order to capture, code, and translate units of meaning
into categories and themes. The third-person inquiry stage of the analysis consisted
of reflections on the theoretical contribution to research. The reflection was man-
aged through dialogues between the IAR and other researchers. The reflection
and analysis continued between the IAR and the co-author during the writing
of this paper.
The validity of this study is based on the deliberate, conscious adoption of the
AR cycle of planning, taking action, and evaluating the action, which in turn leads
to further planning. Reliability was ensured by having different parties in both the
academic and organizational settings triangulate data. For example, after the first
author had analyzed interviews with patients and healthcare professionals, the
result was brought back to them in an emotional map for confirmation. Such
triangulation strengthens the trustworthiness of research (Bryman & Bell, 2007;
Coghlan & Brannick, 2008). The generalizability of this study is analytical
rather than statistical (Bryman & Bell, 2007) and the lessons learned during this
project can support learning for others.
Collaboration on equal premises during the project provided a valuable ethical
safeguard. Participants took part in the study voluntarily and were informed
that they could withdraw at any time. Before starting the projects and the research,
we received ethical approval from the ethical review board in Gothenburg
(Dnr 135­10).

Experiential lessons from the combined EBCD/AR
projects
The findings are based on reflections in first-, second- and third-person inquiry,
compiled and presented as four themes (see Figure 2).
Eye-opening stories (A) is a theme that leads to the construction of a common
picture (B). The third theme is new challenging roles (C), which leads to healthcare
professionals leaving their comfort zone (D). The themes will be further presented
with descriptive quotations from patients and healthcare professionals.
Eye-opening stories
During the improvement process, patients and healthcare professionals had the
opportunity to speak about their own experiences and reflect collaboratively
about the narratives. When they spoke about their own experiences they were
able to reflect on their memories of the care process and they said they felt good
about being able to recall situations that mattered to them. One parent said the
experience reminded her of psychotherapy:
It was so nice to talk with others who had the same, similar experiences--others who
truly understand what you are going through. (Parent in the diabetes project)
Patients and healthcare professionals affirmed each other's experiences, first in the
group meeting and later when meeting others:
They [healthcare professionals] were shocked by our bad experiences, which also made
it feel like we were ``on the same side.'' (Parent in the diabetes project)
Patients said that this process involved ``eye-opening stories.'' One strength of the
EBCD method was that it enabled participants to listen to stories face-to-face,
which they felt gave the improvement areas more attention and dignity. In add-
ition, healthcare professionals confirmed the patients' stories and could ask ques-
tions and give comments that contributed to a common understanding of the

experiences. Professionals stated that it is very easy to have limited vision, and that
this way of working on improvements was revealing.
You can easily become ``blind.'' One thinks differently depending on whether one is a
patient or a healthcare professional. It is great [to see] with fresh parent/patient eyes.
(Nurse in the neo project)
The professionals often thought they knew what was best for patients, but small
things that may not matter greatly to professionals can be very important to
patients. The professionals also mentioned the positive effect of dialogues with
people from other wards in the project groups:
We understand each other better, now that we know a little more about each other's
activities. (Midwife in the neo project)
New perspectives on situations in the care process supported learning and strength-
ened collaboration between wards. Patients and healthcare professionals were
inspired by the combined improvement/research approach and said the process
took advantage of and helped to develop creative ideas.
The IAR continually sought to reduce the gap between the experiences of pro-
fessionals and patients and supported the creation of spaces for dialogues in which
participants could co-construct a joint picture of the patient journey. For example,
the IAR raised situations from the interviews that could be improvement areas, and
suggested action.
Constructing a common picture
Healthcare professionals and patients increased their understanding of how various
situations in the care process could be experienced. The reflective dialogues con-
firmed that the two groups took each other seriously. Professionals had to listen
to the patients first, instead of giving directives and instructions. Patients highlighted
the positive effects of ``bouncing'' their experiences off the professionals. The dia-
logue had synergistic effects, such as mutual understanding and development of
improvement ideas. According to patients, this kind of dialogue felt rare in ordinary
care meetings, which tend to focus on biomedical aspects. The collaborative reflec-
tions provided opportunities for seeing situations from different perspectives, and
participants gained new understanding of the care process. For example, there were
some situations that patients and healthcare professionals experienced in totally
different ways. Both groups felt that a diversity of views came together during the
projects in order to arrive at a more common perspective of patient processes.
Participants said it felt good to share and listen to other people's experiences.
I learned that my ``little banal'' thoughts and experiences made a big difference in the
care of other patients. It feels incredible and very beautiful. (Mother in the neo project)

Patients in the diabetes project saw particular value in meeting each other and
engaged in active dialogues about their experiences. During the project they started
an association for families with children with diabetes. The participants did not
experience the work process as arduous, but rather as a good and fascinating
endeavor.
Very nice! Good to work with them (healthcare professionals) and nice to be taken
seriously. (Parent in the diabetes project)
Dialogues and collaboration were foundations in the improvement work. During
the dialogues, the patients and healthcare professionals also reflected on the
improvement process and pros and cons of EBCD.
New challenging roles
Participants felt that the power relationship between professionals and patients was
more equalized in the improvement/research process than in relationships in an
ordinary care episode:
As a patient you might not dare to give as much feedback to the healthcare profes-
sionals, but when you work together like this where everyone is on the same terms, it
was very positive. (Mother in the neo project)
The patients found their role different and more equal than in their usual role as
patients. They reported they were positively disposed to being part of the improve-
ment team and contributing to better care for sick children. The improvement/
research approach enabled participants to get to know each other and supported
the collaboration in the groups.
It was also nice to learn about healthcare professionals behind the role. The collab-
oration became somehow more humane. (Parent in the diabetes project)
One parent stated being able to help with anything that could lead to better health
for her child was beneficial and that it felt ``great'' to avoid the powerlessness that
otherwise comes with being the parent of a sick child.
The patients' new role was initially uncomfortable for most professionals, who
did not know how to handle it. The patients initially showed a higher attendance
and commitment than the professionals. One of the improvement facilitators in the
diabetes project felt frustrated that the professionals did not show commitment
from the beginning:
It felt strange and frustrating that the healthcare professionals did not receive the
input and offer of assistance to the same extent as the offers were given by parents.
(Improvement facilitator in the diabetes project)
Gustavsson and Andersson 15
During the projects, those people involved obviously acted in new roles. The pro-
fessionals were unused to encounters with the patients in their ``improvement role.''
The healthcare professionals were initially anxious to take responsibility for all
the improvements in the projects. The IAR had to suggest collaboration with
patients and support joint improvement work. The IAR noted that the profes-
sionals appeared to be ashamed that they might not have provided good experi-
ences for the patients. They felt motivated to improve because they thought it was
their duty to do so, and the role of a patient/parent as an improver seemed odd.
Some patients' suggestions for improvements and knowledge exceeded those of
the professionals. This difference contrasted with normal practice, in which pro-
fessionals are usually superior based on their professional medical competence.
Hence, in the final stages of the projects, the professionals expressed that the role
of patients as co-designers was obvious and should always be considered in all
healthcare improvement projects. Patients shared that expectation:
I hope that you are satisfied and continue to use us patients for development purposes.
(Parent in the neo project)
It feels like the right way to do improvement work. We as healthcare professionals
cannot know how patients experience different situations if we don't ask them. (Ward
manager in the neo project)
One of the nurses in the diabetes project stated:
We work as a team and I am probably a ``team person'' and believe in the synergy
effect of more value, if we can have a stimulating dialogue.
The professionals were keen to have continued collaboration with patients in future
improvement initiatives. The improvement projects were considered successful, and
participants were surprised about what could be accomplished.
It is absolutely necessary to work in this way! Good improvements, not difficult to
implement, but healthcare professionals do not find them by themselves. (Manager in
the neonatal project)
In the follow-up meetings, participants found it valuable and gratifying to hear
about successfully completed improvements. There was also a feeling that long-
term relations were being built between patients and healthcare professionals.
Healthcare professionals leaving the comfort zone
The fourth emergent theme was stepping out of one's comfort zone, which relates
to established patterns of improvement work that were challenged in the projects.
Initially, the healthcare professionals were not excited about the idea of working
with patients in improvement projects. This attitude was particularly evident in the
16 Action Research 0(0)
diabetes project because the patients and professionals still had a care relationship,
whereas in the neonatal project the patients had ended their care episode. Parents
initially found it strange to work collaboratively on improvements; they were
unused to coming up with suggestions for how to improve their children's care.
The professionals also felt uncomfortable and feared being criticized or accused of
not doing their work well. At the initial collaborative meetings, both parties felt
nervous and tense.
There was a certain excitement and anxiety in the air at the beginning, but it decreased
later on. (Improvement facilitator in the diabetes project)
The improvement facilitators noted that the patients were much more engaged in
the mission than the professionals during the first meetings. Later on in the project,
tensions disappeared and the collaborative improvement work went more
smoothly.
Patients and healthcare professionals believed that patients can help drive
improvement projects and are an untapped resource for healthcare. Professionals
alone cannot identify all the improvement areas that matter to patients. During the
projects, healthcare professionals became aware of new information and collabor-
ation between professionals and patients became a natural way of working with
improvements. Patients expressed trust in the approach and sought increased use of
EBCD in healthcare.
It feels very good and natural as a patient to be involved and make suggestions for
improvement through experiences. (Parent in the neo project)
Discussion
This section starts with a discussion of the findings in relation to earlier research
and then discusses the benefits of combining AR and EBCD.
Strong professionals in healthcare have traditionally not allowed patients to be
involved in improvement work (Andersson, 2015). The present paper shares experi-
ences that may be of value when testing new approaches to develop healthcare that
involve patients in collaboration with healthcare professionals.
One experience that the patients and healthcare professionals shared in the
projects in this paper was that the variety of perspectives from participants stimu-
lated different interpretations of the experiences and the findings that emerged. The
patients had the whole picture of the process, whereas healthcare professionals saw
only occasional episodes and were sometimes blind to the patient's experience.
Thus, the patients have important insights about how to make improvements.
This information can be important for quality improvement work in healthcare,
as argued in earlier research (Bate & Robert, 2006). Luxford et al. (2011) claimed
that the most common barrier to an increased patient focus is the attitude of
Gustavsson and Andersson 17
professionals. In the presented projects the professionals developed a ``patient-
focused'' mindset during the reflective dialogues; in that way, the dialogues
helped cross the above-mentioned barrier. Bate and Robert (2007) highlighted
that EBCD can help to approach the shift from a strong management orientation
to a more user-centric organizational approach. It is important for healthcare
professionals to realize that the care they think they provide is not always the
care that patients experience (Larkin et al., 2015). During the reflective dialogues,
participants in the studies constructed a common picture of the care process. These
dialogues helped reduce the gap between the experiences of patients and of health-
care professionals and helped to identify and prioritize improvement areas. Earlier
research related to reflecting dialogues in AR aligns with these findings (Reason &
Bradbury, 2009).
Participation in the projects challenged existing roles that had been assumed by
professionals (Luxford et al., 2011) and patients, and challenged them to develop
new roles as co-designers during the improvement process. The collaborative
approach contributed to learning in the context of the professional­patient rela-
tionship and the patients in this study perceived an increase in equality between
professionals and themselves. Patients highlighted the different role that the pro-
jects offered them, which was unlike what they were used to when meeting with
healthcare professionals. These findings support earlier research related to new
understanding, relationships, and a more equal partnership (Iedema et al., 2010).
The AR approach supported reflections about patient involvement in improve-
ments, and the IAR observed a decreased professional dominance and an empow-
ered patient role. This finding aligns with earlier research that indicated a power
structure shift between patients and healthcare professionals (Tritter & McCallum,
2006). In the diabetes project, a social network was funded to support a sustainable
co-design relationship between healthcare professionals and patients. In the pro-
jects, the combination of EBCD and AR helped healthcare professionals to leave
their comfort zone and venture into projects that entailed new roles and a new set
of medical practices.
Previous work on EBCD has shown that patient involvement can lever-
age healthcare improvement (Bate & Robert 2006), but the present study
shows four ways in which AR can enhance this effect: (1) reflective dialogue,
(2) knowledge development beyond the actual project, (3) greater legitimacy,
and (4) interplay between EBCD and AR enable results beyond each of the
approaches:
(1) EBCD is based on sharing experiences--mainly listening to others--while AR
provides a reflective dialogue on these experiences, which promotes a
common view of care practices (see Iedema et al., 2010). Reflective dialogues
during the projects affected the outcomes in several ways. Both individual and
collaborative reflections were stimulated by the preconditions for dialogue
that AR brought to the EBCD process (Iedema et al., 2010; Reason &
Torbert, 2001). Arenas for dialogues were provided several times during all
18 Action Research 0(0)
steps of the project. Participants also engaged individually in reflective practice
after the project, as first-person inquiry when completing the questionnaire.
(2) Knowledge development became more extensive because reflection goes
beyond the actual improvement project to include patient involvement, gen-
eral improvement work, and the quality of specific care processes (in this case,
care for diabetic children and neonatal care).
(3) The research agenda lent greater legitimacy to the project and widened the
impact of the results, which is also mentioned in earlier research (Payne et al.,
2011). For example, the projects have been presented at conferences and in
news articles, and the diabetes project has been included in films related to
service design. It can be assumed that a research agenda also will improve
sustainability, as there is a responsibility to report a result.
(4) The interplay between the EBCD methodology and the AR approach created
value beyond each. This study illustrates that the AR approach can
strengthen the conditions that previous research has shown to be important
for successful EBCD projects: equal partnership, new roles, and dialogue. The
collaborative power of dedicated healthcare professionals and patients
resulted in collaborative learning and several accomplished improvements
(Gustavsson, 2014; Gustavsson et al., 2016).
The dynamic processes of AR and EBCD strengthened the results of the actual
improvement projects and generated knowledge about patient involvement in qual-
ity improvement for the organization. However, the AR element caused the results
to extend beyond the organization and also reach other healthcare organizations
and the research community. A traditional research project without the ``action''
part may not have supported knowledge development during the improvement
work or the participants' roles, as it did in this case.
Conclusion
Patient involvement in healthcare improvement is challenging in many ways, but
this paper also shows the potential of AR and EBCD to influence both profes-
sionals and patients to develop new roles as co-designers. Leaving their comfort
zones, examining new ways of interacting with each other and sharing experiences
all serve to promote eye-opening situations that will encourage healthcare profes-
sionals to embrace new common pictures of care. Managers are often willing to
involve patients in improvement work, but lack the knowledge and experience of
how to do it (Andersson & Olheden, 2012; Bate & Robert, 2006; Iedema et al.,
2010). This paper may help fill that gap of knowledge and practical experience.
There is also a contribution in the area of shifting focus from healthcare profes-
sionals to patients in healthcare improvements. Accordingly, the findings
strengthen earlier research and show that the combination of EBCD and AR is
a promising approach with which to address the challenges of patient involvement
in healthcare improvement.
