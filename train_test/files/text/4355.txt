Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of spinal anaesthesia using dexmedetomidine for
caesarean section.
Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and CNKI were searched for relevant literature.
Results: The incidence of nausea and vomiting in the dexmedetomidine group was significantly
lower than that in the control group (OR ¼ 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12­0.35, P < 0.00001). No difference
was found in the incidence of pruritus between the two groups (OR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36­4.09,
P ¼ 0.76).The dexmedetomidine group had a higher incidence of bradycardia than did the control
group (OR ¼ 2.20, 95% CI: 1.02­4.77, P ¼ 0.05). The incidence of shivering in the dexmedeto-
midine group was significantly lower than that in the control group (OR ¼ 0.20, 95% CI: 0.13­0.32,
P < 0.00001). The incidence of hypotension was not different between the two groups (OR ¼ 0.88,
95% CI: 0.49­1.56, P ¼ 0.65).
Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine can decrease the incidence of nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and
shivering with spinal anaesthesia during caesarean section.

other drugs often need to be administrated
through the spinal canal during anaesthesia.
However, opioids have many adverse reac-
tions, including pruritus. The incidence of
nausea and vomiting caused by caesarean
section is as high as 60%, causing discom-
fort to patients. For full-stomach patients,
reflux and aspiration may occur during
caesarean section.2 Additionally, shivering,
a common complication of patients who
undergo caesarean section, can increase
patients' oxygen consumption, produce
large amounts of CO2
, and increase the
metabolic rate by 400%.3 If heart and lung
diseases are discovered in patients, serious
complications may occur. Prevention of
intraoperative and postoperative shivering
caused by caesarean section is an effective
measure to prevent obstetric complications.4
Moreover, the majority of puerperas may
suffer from hypotension when self-regula-
tion of blood flow is inhibited and support
of abdominal muscles for the uterus dis-
appear when the subarachnoid space is
blocked.5 Dexmedetomidine, which is a
selective a2-receptor agonist, is used for
sedation, analgesia, and inhibition of shiver-
ing during the extubation phase of general
anaesthesia. This study aimed to investigate
the effects of dexmedetomidine on adverse
reactions caused by spinal anaesthesia
during caesarean section.
Materials and methods
Inclusion criteria
With regard to the type of study, we
included randomized, controlled trials
(RCTs), which adopted a blinding method.
Criteria for inclusion of studies were as
follows: (1) original and independent stu-
dies; (2) RCTs; (3) the groups were compar-
able and balanced; and (4) spinal
anaesthesia was used. For interventions,
the experimental group was administered
dexmedetomidine, while a control group
received placebo or saline. Evaluation indi-
cators of adverse reactions included the
following: (1) shivering; (2) nausea and
vomiting; (3) hypotension; (4) bradycardia;
and (5) pruritus.
Exclusion criteria
Any studies with one of the following con-
ditions were excluded: (1) non-RCTs;
(2) retrospective studies; (3) descriptive lit-
erature reviews or systematic reviews; and
(4) no data provided for calculating adverse
reactions.
Search strategy
We searched PubMed, the Cochrane
Library, CNKI, and other Chinese and
foreign databases. We conducted compara-
tive studies on specific clinical trials (from
1989 to 2016) of dexmedetomidine during
spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We
also manually searched the full texts of all
studies to obtain the primary data. The
English search terms included ``dexmedeto-
midine'', ``cesarean section'', and ``spinal
anesthesia.'' The retrievals ranged from
January 1989 to August 2016.
Criteria for assessing the quality
of literature
All RCTs that met the inclusion criteria
were evaluated according to the Jadad scale.
Two reviewers separately assessed the qual-
ity, and consulted a third party or negotiated
with each other when there was a disagree-
ment. The evaluated items included the
following: (1) whether randomization was
performed and whether the method was
correct; (2) whether allocation concealment
was used and whether the method was
correct; (3) whether blinding was performed
and in whom the method was used; and
(4) whether there were withdrawals or
dropouts.

Data extraction
All of the data were independently extracted
using standard data tables by two investiga-
tors. They consulted a third party when
there was a disagreement. The following
contents were extracted from each article:
the first author, the published year, the
number of cases, grouping, and indicators
of adverse reactions.
Statistical analysis
We performed a meta-analysis using Review
Manager 5.2 and examined heterogeneity by
conducting the chi-square test. In this study,
the criteria and analytical method for deter-
mining heterogeneity were as follows. (1) If
I2 was <50%, there was homogeneity, and
the fixed-effects model was used to conduct
the meta-analysis. (2) If I2 was 50% and
heterogeneity between the groups needed to
be combined, the random-effects model was
selected for performing the meta-analysis.
Subgroup analyses or sensitivity analyses
were performed on factors that may con-
tribute to heterogeneity. The data were
analysed by means of the weighted mean
difference if the continuous data were
achieved by using measurement tools or by
means of the standardized mean difference if
the continuous data were obtained by using
different measurement tools. For categorical
data, the odds risks (ORs) were calculated.
All data were calculated with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs). The funnel plot was
used to analyse publication bias.
Results
Literature screening
In accordance with the search strategy, 401
articles were included in the initial search.
A total of 94 articles were selected after
excluding non-relevant literature and non-
original studies by reading titles and
abstracts. Finally, only 12 articles6­17 were
included after further reading the full text
(Figure 1).

Meta-analysis results
2.3.1 Effect of dexmedetomidine on nausea
and vomiting: Nine studies were included.
We compared the incidence of nausea and
vomiting, which was introduced by spinal
anaesthesia during caesarean section,
between the dexmedetomidine and control
groups. The heterogeneity test showed that
I2 ¼ 45%, and thus the fixed-effects model
was used for the meta-analysis. We found
that the dexmedetomidine group had a
significantly lower incidence of nausea
and vomiting than did the control
group (OR ¼ 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12­0.35,
P < 0.00001) (Figure 2).
2.3.2 Effect of dexmedetomidine on prur-
itus: Four studies were included. We com-
pared the incidence of pruritus, which was
caused by spinal anaesthesia during caesar-
ean section, between the dexmedetomidine
and control groups. The heterogeneity test
showed that I2 ¼ 0%, and thus the fixed-
effects model was used to conduct the meta-
analysis. We found that the incidence of
pruritus was not significantly different
between the dexmedetomidine group and
the control group (OR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI:
0.36­4.09, P ¼ 0.76) (Figure 3).
2.3.3 Effect of dexmedetomidine on
bradycardia: Six studies were included. We
compared the incidence of bradycardia,
which was induced by spinal anaesthesia
during caesarean section, between the
dexmedetomidine and control groups.
The heterogeneity test showed that
I2 ¼ 0%, and thus the fixed-effects model
was used to perform the meta-analysis. We
found that the incidence of bradycardia in
the dexmedetomidine group was signifi-
cantly higher than that in the control
group (OR ¼ 2.20, 95% CI: 1.02­4.77,
P ¼ 0.05) (Figure 4).
2.3.4 Effect of dexmedetomidine on shi-
vering: Nine studies were included. We
compared the incidence of shivering, which
was caused by spinal anaesthesia during
caesarean section, between the dexmedeto-
midine and control groups. The heterogen-
eity test showed that I2 ¼ 32%, and thus the
fixed-effects model was used to conduct the
meta-analysis. We found that the incidence
of shivering in the dexmedetomidine group
was significantly lower than that in the
control group (OR ¼ 0.20, 95% CI: 0.13­
0.32, P < 0.00001) (Figure 5).

compared the incidence of hypotension,
which resulted from spinal anaesthesia
during caesarean section, between the dex-
medetomidine and control groups. The het-
erogeneity test showed that I2 ¼ 13%, and
thus the fixed-effects model was used to

there was no significant difference in the
incidence of shivering between the dexme-
detomidine and control groups (OR ¼ 0.88,
95% CI: 0.49­1.56, P ¼ 0.65) (Figure 6).
Discussion
An increasing amount of studies18­20 have
shown that the anaesthetic efficacy of
a2-receptor agonists, such as clonidine
and dexmedetomidine, is satisfactory.
Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective
a2-adrenergic receptor agonist.
Dexmedetomidine inhibits the release of
norepinephrine through stimulating the
a2-adrenergic receptor in the presynaptic
membrane, thus terminating the delivery of
pain signals. Dexmedetomidine also reduces
the activity of sympathetic nerves via the
a2-adrenergic receptor in the postsynaptic
membrane, reduces blood pressure and
heart rate, and produces the effects of sed-
ation and relieving anxiety. Additionally,
dexmedetomidine in combination with the
a2-adrenergic receptor in the spinal cord is
an effective analgesia.19
Shivering is a common complication of
caesarean section. The incidence of shivering
ranges from 5% to 65% in caesarean sec-
tion. The main reasons for shivering include
partial inhibition of the spinal reflex,
decreased sympathetic activity, suppressed
adrenal function, and surgical stimulation
and pain. For puerperas, severe shivering
can lead to increased consumption of
oxygen, a rise in production of CO2
and
blood sugar, acceleration of heart rate, and
in severe cases, severe hypoxaemia and
acidosis. Dexmedetomidine is a highly
selective and a novel a2-adrenergic receptor
agonist. Dexmedetomidine acts on the a2-
adrenergic receptor in the brain and spinal
cord, inhibiting the discharge of nerve cells
to hypnotize, sedate, resist anxiety, and
mitigate the patient's poor mood.21 Phan
et al.22 reported that dexmedetomidine
curbs the thermoregulatory centre in the
brain by suppressing delivery of information
via body temperature at the spinal cord
level, thus inhibiting shivering.
Nausea and vomiting during periopera-
tion are adverse events for patients, obstetri-
cians, and anaesthesiologists. Uncontrolled
abdominal movement during surgery can
increase the risk of visceral injury. The exact
aetiology of perioperative nausea and
vomiting remains unclear. A variety of
factors are likely to cause nausea and
vomiting.23 Cerebral ischaemia tends to
trigger vomiting during combined spinal
and epidural anaesthesia for caesarean sec-
tion. Blocking of sympathetic nerves and
hypotension secondary to spinal anaesthe-
sia, visceral pain, and vagal stimulation are
the most important factors in caesarean

section. Hypotension may be the most
important cause of nausea and vomiting.
Studies have demonstrated that dexmedeto-
midine has effects of analgesia and sedation
during spinal anaesthesia. Intravenously
injected dexmedetomidine leads to hyperpo-
larization of nerve tissue to produce an
analgesic effect and enhance regional anaes-
thesia by changing the transmembrane and
ionic conductivity of blue-spot in the brain-
stem. The stable haemodynamic effects of
dexmedetomidine are mainly related to the
enhanced stability of the sympathetic adren-
ergic system. Steady haemodynamics may
reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting.
Dexmedetomidine has little effect on
hypotension and pruritus during caesarean
section. Moreover, dexmedetomidine
reduces the activity of sympathetic nerves
via the a2-adrenergic receptor in the post-
synaptic membrane and reduces heart rate,
and thus increases the incidence of
bradycardia.
Several limitations of this meta-analysis
should be taken into account. First, the
quality of the included studies was uneven.
Additionally, the number of included RCTs
was too small. Moreover, the methodo-
logical quality used in evaluating the 13
RCTs was not high. Because we only
included published literature, the search
strategy and publication bias also could
have affected the results of this study.
In summary, dexmedetomidine can
reduce the incidence of nausea, vomiting,
and shivering in spinal anaesthesia for
caesarean section, but it does not reduce
the incidence of pruritus and hypotension.
Dexmedetomidine can raise the incidence of
bradycardia.
