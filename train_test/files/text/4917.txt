Abstract
Introduction: Previous studies have linked angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism
(II, ID and DD) to physical performance. Moreover, ACE has two catalytic domains: NH2 (N) and COOH (C) with
distinct functions, and their activity has been found to be modulated by ACE polymorphism. The aim of the present study
is to investigate the effects of the interaction between aerobic exercise training (AET) and ACE I/D polymorphism on
ACE N- and C-domain activities and vascular reactivity in humans.
Materials and methods: A total of 315 pre-selected healthy males were genotyped for II, ID and DD genotypes. Fifty
completed the full AET (II, n = 12; ID, n = 25; and DD, n = 13), performed in three 90-minute sessions weekly, in the
four-month exercise protocol. Pre- and post-training resting heart rate (HR), peak O2
consumption (VO2
peak), mean
blood pressure (MBP), forearm vascular conduction (FVC), total circulating ACE and C- and N-domain activities were
assessed. One-way ANOVA and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA were used.
Results: In pre-training, all variables were similar among the three genotypes. In post-training, a similar increase in FVC (35%)
was observed in the three genotypes. AET increased VO2
peak similarly in II, ID and DD (49±2 vs. 57±1; 48±1 vs. 56±3;
and 48±5 vs. 58±2 ml/kg/min, respectively). Moreover, there were no changes in HR and MBP. The DD genotype was also
associated with greater ACE and C-domain activities at pre- and post-training when compared to II. AET decreased similarly
the total ACE and C-domain activities in all genotypes, while increasing the N-domain activity in the II and DD genotypes.
However, interestingly, the measurements of N-domain activity after training indicate a greater activity than the other
genotypes. These results suggest that the vasodilation in response to AET may be associated with the decrease in total ACE
and C-domain activities, regardless of genotype, and that the increase in N-domain activity is dependent on the DD genotype.
Conclusions: AET differentially affects the ACE C- and N-domain activities, and the N-domain activity is dependent on
ACE polymorphism.

Introduction
Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallo-
peptidase that plays a central role in the control of blood pres-
sure (BP) and fluid homeostasis.ACE is part of the endocrine
renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and cleaves angiotensin I
(Ang I) while yielding angiotensin II (Ang II), an octapeptide
responsible for most of the effects of the RAS.1
Circulating plasmatic ACE has two active domains, the
COOH (C) and the NH2 (N) terminal domains, according
to their position. These domains share 60% sequence iden-
tity, except for 37amino acid residues at the C terminus.2
In spite of the high degree of homology, each domain pos-
sesses a functional active site that differs in relation to sub-
strate and inhibitor specificities.3 For example, Ang I,
substance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and
bradykinin are cleaved by both domains,4­7 but only the N
domain cleaves the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-
lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP),8 a negative regulator of
hematopoiesis.
ACE activity varies widely among individuals and
genetic factors have been suggested to account for this
variability.9,10 It has been shown that the absence (dele-
tion, D) rather than the presence (insertion, I) of a 287-
base pair (bp) Alu repeat sequence within intron 16 of the
ACE gene is associated with greater levels and activity of
this enzyme. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that
ACE I/D polymorphism affects ACE domains' activities,
and in II individuals ACE C- and N-domain activities
were significantly lower when compared both to ID and
DD.11 These findings suggest that ACE I/D polymor-
phism affects total ACE as well as ACE N- and C-domain
activities.
This genetic variant was also associated with athletic
performance, with the I allele being associated with endur-
ance-related events and the D allele with strength-related
sports.9,10,12­15 However, no studies to date have investi-
gated the effects of a long-term aerobic training protocol in
circulating ACE N- and C-domain activities. If a genetic
variant related to lower ACE activity is associated with
athletic performance, it is possible that aerobic exercise
training (AET) may affect/drive ACE activity toward
lower activity levels.9,10 Studies have indicated that shear-
stress affects ACE activity transiently,16 and its own down-
regulation may be explained by increased shear stress with
exercise-induced hyperemia. Furthermore, as the ACE
domains have different substrate and inhibitor specificities
and since the ACE I/D polymorphism affects the domains'
activities, it is possible that AET and ACE I/D polymor-
phism interaction may differently influence ACE domains'
activities.
Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate
the interaction between ACE I/D polymorphism and AET
on total ACE and ACE C- and N-domain activities, as well
as on the forearm blood flow (FBF) and conductance.
Methods and materials
The participants completed all evaluations at pre- and
post-four months of AET intervention.
Study population
A total of 315 pre-selected healthy male Brazilian police-
men recruits were invited to participate in the study. They
were genotyped for the ACE gene polymorphism. Fifty
recruits completed the full training protocol. To avoid gen-
der, age, and disease confounding in our study, the eligibil-
ity for taking part in the study was determined by sex (only
males), healthy status (no known history of medical condi-
tions), tobacco consumption (nonsmokers only) and age
(between 19 and 36 years). The individuals were screened
for cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic disorders.
They had no apparent cardiovascular disease. Clinical
examination, laboratory testing, and cardiopulmonary
exercise test determined their health status. The Ethics
Committee for the Protection of the Human Subject of the
Heart Institute (InCor) and the Clinical Hospital of the
University of São Paulo, the Faculty of Medicine, approved
the study protocol. The research was conducted in accord-
ance with the World Medical Association's 2008
Declaration of Helsinki. Individuals included in the study
took no medication for at least three months prior to study
enrollment, and abstained from caffeine and alcohol one
day before study measurements.17
ACE gene polymorphism
The ACE gene I/D polymorphism were determined by
means of a three-primer system.18 Quality control for these
assays was assessed by randomly selecting 50 samples to
be re-genotyped by three independent technicians.
Genomic DNA was obtained from whole blood following
a standard salting-out protocol.19 Genotyping was con-
ducted following previous work.
Assessment of the ACE gene polymorphism genotype.Five-
milliliter blood samples were drawn into tubes containing
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The ACE I/D polymorphism
Alves et al. 3
was determined using a three-primer system,19 which mini-
mizes the mistyping20 that can occur with a two-primer sys-
tem. Polymerase chain reaction products were visualized by
electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and
stored in digital form.
Serum ACE activity
A fasting 10 ml blood sample was obtained from a superfi-
cial forearm vein. The blood was collected without antico-
agulant, kept on ice, rapidly centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes and frozen after each group of data collection.
Serum samples were stored at -80oC and used a single
cycle of freeze-thaw before analysis for assaying ACE
activity.20 The total storage of the samples was maintained
at -80oC between the total collection and analysis of sam-
ples.ACE activity was assayed in serum using fluorescence
resonance energy transfer substrates containing ortho-
aminobenzoic (Abz) and dinitrophenyl (Dnp) as fluores-
cence donor/acceptor pair, namely Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH
for total ACE activity, Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH for the
N-domain activity and Abz-LFK(Dnp)P-OH for the
C-domain activity derivatives as substrates by continuously
measuring the fluorescence.21,22 The assays were performed
in a 96-well plate and 5 µl plasma was incubated with 10
µM of appropriate substrate at 37ºC in 0.1 M Tris-HCl
buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 µM ZnCl2
in a
final volume of 200 µl. Fluorescence increments along the
timeline were read at 420
nm emission:320
nm excitation.
The hydrolysis rate of the intramolecularly quenched
fluorogenic substrates were incubated with aliquots of
serum for 60 minutes to obtain total ACE enzymatic activ-
ity, and for 90 minutes to obtain enzymatic activity of the N
and C domains. The slope was converted into nmol sub-
strate hydrolyzed per minute based on a calibration curve
obtained by complete hydrolysis of the peptide as reported
previously.23 ACE activity is reported as UF.min­1.ml­1
(1 UF = nmol ofAbz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH hydrolyzed per min-
ute). Measurements were made in triplicate with differ-
ences accounting for less than 5%.
Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test
Maximal exercise capacity was determined during a maxi-
mal progressive exercise test on a treadmill (Quinton
Instruments Company, Seattle, WA, USA), with workload
increments of one metabolic equivalent (MET) every min-
ute until exhaustion. A breath-by-breath gas exchange ana-
lyzer (Vmax 29, Sensor Medics, Buena Vista, CA, USA)
was used to measure VO2
and carbon dioxide production.
Peak VO2
was defined as the maximum attained VO2
at the
end of the exercise period at which the individual could no
longer maintain running exercise. This method is consid-
ered the gold standard for assessing patients' exercise
capacity. Ventilatory threshold was determined as occur-
ring at the breakpoint between the increase in the carbon
dioxide production and VO2
(V-slope) or the point at which
the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen and end-tidal oxygen
partial pressure curves reached their respective minimum
values and began to rise. Respiratory compensation was
determined to occur at the point at which the ventilatory
equivalent for carbon dioxide was lowest before a system-
atic increase and when end-tidal carbon dioxide partial
pressure reached a maximum and began to decrease. The
reproducibility of the peak VO2
measured at a different
time interval in the same individual expressed as ml/kg/
min in our laboratory is r = 0.95. Heart rate (HR) was con-
tinuously monitored by electrocardiography (ECG), and
BP was measured by sphygmomanometry. This test was
repeated after 16weeks of AET.24
Handgrip exercise
After the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC, average
of three trials) was obtained, handgrip isometric exercise
was performed at 30% of MVC for three minutes with the
dominant arm, using a handgrip dynamometer (Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL, USA). Individuals were instructed to
breathe normally during exercise and to avoid inadvertent
performance of a valsalva maneuver.
Measurements during the handgrip exercise
BP and HR. During the handgrip exercise, BP was moni-
tored noninvasively and intermittently with the use of an
automatic oscillometric cuff (Dixtal DX 2710, Dixtal Bio-
médica, Manaus, AM, Brazil) placed on the ankle with
cuff width adjusted to ankle circumference. HR was moni-
tored continuously through lead II of the ECG.17
FBF. FBF was measured by venous occlusion plethysmog-
raphy.25 The nondominant arm was elevated above heart
level to ensure adequate venous drainage. A mercury-filled
silastic tube attached to a low-pressure transducer was
placed around the forearm and connected to a plethysmo-
graph (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA). Sphygmomanom-
eter cuffs were placed around the wrist and upper arm. At
15-second intervals, the upper cuff was inflated above
venous pressure for seven to eight seconds. The cuff
around the wrist was maintained continuously inflated
during the entire experimental protocol at a supra-systolic
pressure (240 mmHg) to prevent the passage of blood flow
into the hand. The increase in tension on the silastic tube
reflected the volume of the forearm and hence its vasodila-
tion. FBF (ml/min/100 ml tissue) was determined on the
basis of a minimum of four separate readings. The record
of the flow wave was recorded on a computer and ana-
lyzed using specific software (WinDaq Software, Dataq
Instruments Inc, Akron, OH, USA).
Forearm vascular conductance (FVC).FVC was calculated by
dividing FBF by the mean arterial pressure. In our laboratory,
4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
the reproducibility of FBF measured at different time inter-
vals in the same individual, expressed as milliliters per min-
ute per 100 ml tissue, had a correlation coefficient of 0.93.
Handgrip experimental protocol
The handgrip evaluation protocol occurred between 07:00
and 10:00 a.m. with the patients in a supine position in a
quiet, air-conditioned room (21­22ºC). Patients were
instructed to sleep at least seven hours, to not participate in
physical exercise for 24 hours prior to the study, and to
consume a light meal without caffeine before participating
in the protocol. The participants were positioned, and ECG
leads were placed on the chest. Cuffs for FBF measure-
ment were placed on the nondominant arm and a cuff for
BP measurement was placed on the ankle. After a 15-min-
ute rest period baseline values for FBF, BP and HR were
recorded for three minutes. Moderate static handgrip exer-
cise at 30% of MVC was then performed for three minutes,
followed by a recovery period of three minutes.20 FBF, BP
and HR were recorded continuously during the handgrip
exercise. Mean BP (MBP) was measured every minute,
and FBF was measured every 15 seconds. All studies were
performed in a temperature-controlled (21°C) room,
between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.23
AET protocol
Individuals underwent AET for 65­90 minutes, three ses-
sions weekly, during four months supervised by an exer-
cise specialist. Exercise intensity was individually graded
between aerobic/anaerobic thresholds according to HR
obtained during baseline maximal cardiopulmonary exer-
cise testing. The training protocol consisted of two months
of moderate intensity (aerobic threshold) followed by two
months of high-intensity (anaerobic threshold) AET.26
AET sessions consisted of five minutes of warm-up, fol-
lowed by 60 minutes of jogging or running. In the first two
months they also performed 25 minutes of local strength-
ening exercises (sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups).20
Strengthening exercises had the purpose of protecting the
muscles and joints. Thus, this increased strength gave
these individuals the capacity to achieve the prescribed
protocol at the end of four months.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. The calculation for the
sample size was determined according to a previous study
with a similar population of healthy men in an investiga-
tion of the polymorphism of allele T at promoter region of
the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene.24 The
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test was used to assess the normal-
ity of distribution of each variable studied. Baseline analy-
ses were subjected to one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). In the post-training period, total ACE and
C- and N-domain activities, cardiopulmonary analyses,
FBF and FVC were subjected to two-way ANOVA with
repeated measures. When significance was found,
Scheffé's post hoc comparisons were performed.
Probability values of p  0.05 were considered statistically
significant. The FBF and FVC data were expressed as area
under the curve (AUC).20 Inter-assay percentage coeffi-
cients of variability were considered acceptable for <15%
and intra-assay percentage coefficients of variability were
considered acceptable for <10%. Interaction in two-way
ANOVA occurs when there are different responses to an
intervention among study groups.
Results
Baseline characteristics
In 315 individuals, the genotypic frequencies were 23 %
(II), 51% (ID) and 26% (DD), respectively. These were
similar to the results found in another study conducted in a
Brazilian population, which showed the same genotypic
frequencies 19% (II), 53% (ID) and 28% (DD), respec-
tively.18 The rare allele frequency was 45.4% (I) and 54.6%
(D). The genotypes were in Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
( p = 0.4050).
The physical characteristics and metabolic measure-
ments of the 50 men who completed the full AET, group II
(n = 12), group ID (n = 25) and group DD (n = 13), are
shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in
age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI). Glucose,
total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were
all similar among II, ID and DD genotypes. In the pre-
training period, at post- and during the handgrip exercise,
MBP and HR were similar. All of these parameters
increased significantly and similarly among II, ID and DD
genotypes (Table 2).
Effects of AET
All the individuals studied showed an increase of VO2
peak (12±2%), FBF (30%) and FVC (35%).12 Moreover,
the II, ID and DD groups showed a significant and similar
increase in VO2
peak (49±2 vs. 57±1; 48±1 vs. 56±3; and
48±5 vs. 58±2 ml/kg/min, respectively) from pre- to post-
AET program; interaction, p = 0.14, *p < 0.02 vs. pre- for
all groups, Figure 1.
Participants carrying II, ID and DD had a significant
increase in FBF in AUC when the values pre- and post-
AET were compared; phase pre- and post-, *p < 0.01,
interaction, p = 0.12, Figure 2(a). Similarly, the FVC
appeared higher in all genotypes when values pre- versus
post-AET were compared; phase pre- and post-, *p < 0.01,
interaction, p = 0.50, Figure 2(b). After AET there were no
changes in HR and MBP for all three groups (Table 2).

AET and total ACE and C- and N-domain activities.In
response to the 16 weeks of theAET program, we observed
significant reductions in activities of total ACE p < 0.02
(Figure 3(a)) and ACE C-domain p < 0.001 (Figure 3(b)),
and there was an increase in ACE N-domain activity p <
0.01 (Figure 3(c)) in all individuals studied.
AET and ACE I/D polymorphism, total ACE and domain
activities.In the pre-training period, total ACE and
C-domain activities were lower in II than DD geno-
types; interaction, p < 0.05), while N-domain activity
was similar in the three genotypes (Figure 4(a), (b), and
(c), respectively).
In the post-training period, total ACE and C-domain
activities decreased in all the genotype groups II, ID and DD
compared to the pre-training period; interaction, p < 0.05,
Figure 4(a) and (b), respectively. However, the N-domain
activity increased in the II and DD genotype (Figure 4(c)).
Individuals harboring the DD genotype had a 34%
greater increase in N-domain activity levels when com-
pared with individuals of the other two genotypes; interac-
tion, p < 0.01 (Figure 4(c)).
Discussion
The present study is the first to show that AET differen-
tially modulates circulating total ACE and ACE C- and
N-terminal activities in humans; moreover, the ACE I/D

polymorphism affects this training response. Overall, the
results showed that in the pre- and post-training period the
total ACE and C-domain activities were lower in II than
DD genotypes; moreover, AET decreased similarly to the
total circulating ACE and ACE C-terminal domain activi-
ties in all genotypes, while ACE N-terminal domain activ-
ity was increased in the DD group. When analyzed
separately the II, ID and DD genotypes showed a reduction
in total ACE and ACE C-terminal domain activities after
AET; it decreased similarly to the total ACE and C-domain
activitiesinallgenotypeswhereasitincreasedtheN-domain
activity in the II and DD genotypes. However, interestingly,
the measurements for N-domain activity in the DD geno-
type at post-training were greater than the other genotypes.
These results show that AET regulates total ACE and ACE
C- and N-terminal domain activities and is dependent on
the ACE I/D polymorphism.
Many studies have shown that the ACE I/D polymor-
phism is associated with endurance-related events.9,10 The
presence of the I allele is associated with lower serum and
tissue ACE activity and improved performance in endur-
ance sports,12 while the D allele is associated with higher
circulating and tissue ACE activity and enhanced perfor-
mance at sports that require sprinting or short bursts of
power.27 As a genotype related to decreased ACE activity
is associated with endurance performance, our initial
hypothesis was that the AET would decrease total ACE
activity, and our results confirm this hypothesis. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the
effects of a period of AET on circulating ACE activity in
humans.
ACE hydrolyses peptides by the removal of a dipeptide
from the C-terminus, as in the conversion of Ang I to Ang
II, a potent vasoconstrictor and degrader of bradykinin.28
Therefore, the reduction in ACE activity, as observed after
the AET protocol, might allow for higher blood flow and
vascular conductance, which would be beneficial during
exercise.20 Our results show that FBF and FVC were
increased after the AET protocol, a result that is consistent
with the reduction in ACE activity. Furthermore, we evalu-
ated the effects of the AET protocol on ACE C- and
N-terminal domains. Interestingly, in the pre-training
period total ACE and ACE C-domain activities were lower
in II than DD genotypes. In order to draw a clearer picture
of the functional consequences of these differences, we
evaluated FBF before and after the AET protocol and
observed a similar increase in all genotypes. These results
suggest that FBF after exercise training is associated with a
reduction in ACE C-terminal domain activity, but is inde-
pendent of ACE N-terminal domain activity. Van Ginkel
et al. showed that individuals with the ACE-II polymor-
phism had significantly larger recruitment of the relative
capillaries after exercise compared to people with ACE-ID/
DD, showing a relationship between ACE genotype and

blood flow.15 In line with this, some studies have demon-
strated that ACE affects its own regulation in response to
shear stress and suggest that the ACE extracellular domain
behaves as a mechanosensor while the cytoplasmic domain
elicits downstream intracellular signaling by phosphoryla-
tion on Ser1270.16 Therefore, repeated bouts of exercise
cause a downregulation of the ACE C-terminal activity
probably because shear stress affects ACE activity tran-
siently, and its own downregulation could be explained by
increased shear stress with exercise-induced hyperemia.
Thus, the decrease of ACE signaling by shear stress might
also contribute to reducingAng II formation and accumula-
tion of bradykinin and all its consequences on higher blood
flow and vascular conductance. Corroborating, we previ-
ously showed decreased ACE activity and increased vascu-
lar reactivity in response to exercise training modulated by
the +9/­9 bradykinin B2 receptor gene functional polymor-
phism, the main peptide degradable by ACE.19
We are unaware of previous studies that assessed the
interaction between ACE I/D polymorphism and AET on
ACE domain activities. Our results show that although the
decrease inACE C-terminal domain activity is dependent on
the ACE I/D polymorphism, ACE N-terminal domain is
increased only in individuals harboring the DD genotype. It
is known that the ACE N-terminal domain is able to cleave
and inactivate the negative hemoregulator Ac-SDKP 50
times faster than the ACE C-terminal domain, making this
tetrapeptide a natural substrate for the ACE N-terminal
domain.8 Ac-SDKP is found in the bone marrow and in the
peripheral circulation and reversibly prevents the recruit-
ment of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells into the S-phase
of the cellular cycle by maintaining them in the G0 phase.29,30
Therefore, by acting on Ac-SDKP, the ACE N-terminal
domain plays an important role on the stimulation of hemat-
opoiesis. As AET stimulates the production of red blood
cells,31 it is possible that hematopoiesis was increased in par-
ticipants with the DD polymorphism. Unfortunately, we did
not assess hematopoiesis in the present study, which would
have been useful in clarifying the functional consequences of
increased ACE N-terminal in the DD genotype.32
The decrease in ACE C-terminal domain activity and
the increase in ACE N-terminal domain activity are both
beneficial in the context of AET adaptations, once these
changes promote improvements in blood flow/conduct-
ance and red blood cell proliferation, respectively, and
these aid performance improvement.33,34 Most medical
applications have involved so far the regulation of ACE
activity in the control of hypertension35 and for prophylac-
tic treatment of heart disease control.34 Therefore, it is pos-
sible thatAET can help to improve blood flow and vascular
conductance, which would be advantageous for those who
practice AET.

Our study has several limitations. First is the lack of a
control group with which to compare the changes observed
in the experimental group. Therefore, it is not clear whether
the changes observed are due to changes over time or due
to AET. We studied only young males who were not com-
pletely sedentary because they are on-duty police officers.
Thus, we cannot rule on the results for the population in
general, mostly women and older and completely seden-
tary individuals. Moreover, there was a lack of assessment
of the changes in body composition and the nutritional sta-
tus of the participants during the four months of training
program that may have interfered in the effect of exercise
training on ACE activity and its association with vascular
reactivity. Since we studied police officers, however, shar-
ing similar meals during the evaluations, we do not think
that this particular issue could have affected our results. In
addition, we finished with only 50 men who adhered to the
AET. But we have in our favor that we had all measure-
ments for all 50 study participants. In this context, future
studies in broad aspects of an overall population are
needed, aiming especially at investigating the mechanisms
that affect the ACE I/D polymorphism and AET on ACE
domain activities.
In conclusion, in the present study we showed for the
first time that ACE C- and N-terminal domain activities
can be modulated by AET in interaction with the ACE I/D
polymorphism.
