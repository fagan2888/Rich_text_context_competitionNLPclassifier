Background.The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mobility limitations is high among older
adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MCI status and both performance-based and
self-report measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults.
Methods. An analysis was conducted on baseline data from the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study in the Elderly
study, a cohort study of 430 primary care patients aged 65 or older. Neuropsychological tests identified participants with
MCI and further subclassified those with impairment in memory domains (aMCI), nonmemory domains (naMCI), and
multiple domains (mdMCI). Linear regression models were used to assess the association between MCI status and mobil-
ity performance in the Habitual Gait Speed, Figure of 8 Walk, Short Physical Performance Battery, and self-reported
Late Life Function and Disability Instrument's Basic Lower Extremity and Advanced Lower Extremity function scales.
Results. Participants had a mean age of 76.6 years, and 42% were characterized with MCI. Participants with MCI
performed significantly worse than participants without MCI (No-MCI) on all performance and self-report measures (p <
.01). All MCI subtypes performed significantly worse than No-MCI on all mobility measures (p < .05) except for aMCI
versus No-MCI on the Figure of 8 Walk (p = .054) and Basic Lower Extremity (p = .11). Moreover, compared with aMCI,
mdMCI manifested worse performance on the Figure of 8 Walk and Short Physical Performance Battery, and naMCI
manifested worse performance on Short Physical Performance Battery and Basic Lower Extremity.
Conclusions.Among older community-dwelling primary care patients, performance on a broad range of mobility
measures was worse among those with MCI, appearing poorest among those with nonmemory MCI.

For community-dwelling older adults, both cognitive
impairments and mobility limitations are highly preva-
lent and can interfere with the ability to maintain independ-
ent living (1­3). It is estimated that among adults aged 65 or
older, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
is between 10% and 20%, and the prevalence of mobility
problems is equally as high (4,5).
MCI is defined as cognitive decline greater than that
expected for one's age and education level, but which
does not interfere appreciably with daily function (5,6).
MCI is a well-known risk factor for dementia (7,8), with
an annual conversion rate from MCI to dementia around
15% (8). Moreover, people with MCI are at increased
risk of mobility decline, falls, and institutionalization
(2,7,9).
Studies evaluating gait parameters indicate that cognitive
function and mobility are linked. In a review, Monterro-
Odasso and coworkers (9) highlighted that many of the brain
regions (eg, hippocampus) affected by cognitive impair-
ment also mediate aspects of mobility. It is also recognized
that altered mobility performance precedes the behavioral
manifestation of MCI (10). Therefore, mobility tests may
serve as assessment tools for patients who either manifest,
or are at risk for, developing cognitive impairment. A wide
variety of clinical tests evaluates mobility by physical
performance or self-report measures. However, few stud-
ies have contrasted how performance on these different
mobility tests varies with MCI status and with specific
MCI subtypes. One study that evaluated differences in gait
analysis findings among different subtypes of MCI found
1512 Pedersen et al.
that different gait parameters were associated with amnestic
MCI compared with nonamnestic MCI (11). Also, among
older adults with MCI, executive function deficits are asso-
ciated with poorer mobility performance and future risk for
falls (12,13). By definition, nonamnestic MCI is largely
influenced by executive function impairments, which sug-
gests that these individuals may be at a heightened risk for
poor mobility status and fall risk. Lastly, recent studies sug-
gest that specific cognitive domains may be preferentially
influential to specific mobility tests (14,15). However, these
findings did not account for MCI status.
MCI is considered a subclinical state, which may remain
unreported or undetected for a period of time. The first cli-
nician to address these concerns is commonly the primary
care practitioner (8). If mobility tests are to be considered
as screening tools for incipient cognitive impairment (eg,
MCI), then it will be essential to better understand the asso-
ciation between cognitive status and mobility performance.
Also, it will be clinically important to evaluate these asso-
ciations within primary care settings. Thus, based on the
current evidence and the importance of screening for MCI
within primary care settings, we investigated the associa-
tion between cognitive function and mobility among older
primary care patients, and more specifically the association
between mobility and both MCI and MCI subtypes. We
hypothesized (1) that participants with cognitive impair-
ment, consistent with a diagnosis of MCI, would manifest
greater limitation in performance-based and self-report
measures of mobility than participants who did not meet
diagnostic criteria for MCI (ie, cognitively intact); (2) that
these associations would be maintained for all MCI sub-
types; and (3) lastly that participants with nonamnestic
MCI would manifest worse performance than those with
amnestic MCI.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using base-
line data collected as part of the Boston Rehabilitative
Impairment Study in the Elderly (Boston RISE), a cohort
study of 430 community-dwelling and independent ambu-
lating primary care patients aged 65 or older. The Boston
RISE methods have been described in detail elsewhere (16).
Briefly, participants were recruited through primary care
practices at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham
and Women's Hospital, two large academic medical cent-
ers located in Boston, Massachusetts. Eligible participants
were identified through a Partners HealthCare patient data-
base and telephone screening interviews and were invited to
an initial screening and assessment visit. Potential subject
were subsequently invited to undergo supplementary screen-
ing tests. Inclusion criteria were community-dwelling older
adults, aged 65 or older, ability to understand and commu-
nicate in English, and self-reported difficulty with walking
half a mile (6 blocks) or climbing one flight of stairs (10
steps). Patients were excluded for the presence of a terminal
disease, significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hyper-
tension, amputation of a lower extremity, use of supplemen-
tal oxygen, myocardial infarction or major surgery in the
previous 6 months, planned major surgery, planned move
from the Boston area within 2 years, cognitive impairment
of significant severity as to likely reflect dementia (defined
as Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score <18)
(17), and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score
less than 4 (18). Recruitment was based upon U.S. Census
data 2000, to ensure an inclusion representing the ethnic,
racial, and gender distribution of older adults residing
within a 10-mile radius of our center. All of the methods of
the Boston RISE study were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
Participants gave written informed consent before participa-
tion, and study procedures were approved by the Spaulding
Rehabilitation Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Measures
The baseline assessments included a physical examina-
tion, a medical history questionnaire, the Self-Administered
Comorbidity Questionnaire that assesses 13 comorbidities
and has been validated for epidemiological trials among
older adults (19), demographics, neuropsychological test-
ing, physical performance testing, and questionnaires on
functional ability.
Neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate cogni-
tive performance and to characterize participants with MCI.
Moreover, MCI was further subclassified as impairment in
memory domains versus nonmemory domains using the
current framework on MCI (20). Both self-report and per-
formance-based mobility measures were used to investigate
the association between MCI domains and mobility.
Cognitive measures.--Trail Making test.--The Trail
Making test is a well established reliable and valid assess-
ment of executive function that measures cognitive abilities
of sequencing, visual scanning, processing speed, shift-
ing attention, and cognitive flexibility (21,22). The test is
administered in two parts, A and B, in which the participant
is asked to connect circled numbers and letters. Both tests
are sensitive to cognitive decline (21,22). Time to complete
each test was recorded, and faster completion times indicate
better performance (21,22).
Digit Symbol Substitution test.--The Digit Symbol
Substitution test is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence scale (23). The test is a measure of process-
ing speed and visual­spatial skills, has an executive func-
tion component assessing sustained attention, and has good
test­retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient =
0.80) (21). The test consists of a series of numbers and
Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mobility 1513
corresponding symbols. The participant was asked to fill in
a response form with as many corresponding symbols to
numbers as possible in 90 seconds. The number of correct
number­symbol matches was recorded with a higher score
indicating better performance.
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised.--The Hopkins
Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R) is a valid test
of verbal memory and learning (24). The test includes a
list of 12 words of concrete objects that are read aloud by
the examiner across three learning trials (25). The scores
derived from the test are (a) total recall, the total number
of words correctly recalled on trials 1­3; (b) delayed recall,
the number of words correctly recalled after 20­25 min-
utes; and (c) recognition discrimination, the number of true
responses minus the number of false responses on a subse-
quent recognition task (25). The HVLT-R is a valid instru-
ment for clinical and research-based neuropsychological
assessment with elderly patients (24).
Mild cognitive impairment.--The identification of par-
ticipants meeting the diagnostic criteria for MCI was based
on performance on the neuropsychological tests. The raw
scores of each test were converted into age-adjusted stand-
ardized scores (z scores) based on published normative
data from healthy age matched peers (23,26­28). Use of
standardized scores allowed for comparisons across cogni-
tive measures, cognitive domains, and across age groups.
Consistent with previous studies, we used a cutoff of 1.5
SD below the age-adjusted means to identify impaired
performance on a given cognitive measure (7,29). MCI
was defined as an impairment (ie, z < -1.5) on two sub-
tests within the neuropsychological test battery (HVLT-R
total recall, HVLT-R delayed recall, HVLT-R recogni-
tion discrimination, Digit Symbol Substitution test, Trails
A, and Trails B) (30). All participants were identified as
either cognitively intact (No-MCI) or as having cognitive
impairment (MCI).
MCI has been classified into two subtypes, amnestic
and nonamnestic MCI, and further into single or multi-
ple domain categories (5,30,31). Amnestic MCI denotes
impairment within the cognitive domain of memory but
not of sufficient severity to meet the diagnostic criteria for
dementia, accompanied by preserved executive function,
attention, language, and visual­spatial skills. In contrast,
nonamnestic MCI denotes intact performance within the
domain of memory but with impairment in at least one of
the other cognitive domains (5).
The subtest scores of the HVLT-R (total recall, delayed
recall, recognition discrimination) were used to define mem-
ory impairment, and the subtest scores of the Trail Making
test and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (Trails A, Trails B,
and Digit Symbol Substitution test) were used to define non-
memory impairment. Participants identified as having MCI
were classified into one of three groups as follows: (a) single
domain amnestic MCI (aMCI) if at least two tests within the
memory domain were impaired (ie, z < -1.5) and no other
cognitive impairments were identified, (b) multiple domain
amnestic MCI (mdMCI) if memory and nonmemory domains
were impaired, or (c) nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) if two tests
within the nonmemory domain were impaired (6,30).
Measures of mobility.--Habitual Gait Speed.--Habitual
Gait Speed (HGS) tested straight path walking and was meas-
ured by asking participants to walk a 4-m straight walk at their
usual pace starting from a standing position (18,32). HGS is
a valid and reliable measure in community-dwelling older
adults (33,34) and is predictive of disability and adverse out-
comes (10,34­36). Clinically meaningful differences for HGS
are reported as 0.03­0.05 m/s (minimal difference) and 0.08
m/s (substantial difference) (37).
Figure of 8 Walk.--The Figure of 8 Walk (F8W) tested
curved path walking (38). Participants were timed while
walking in a figure of 8 pattern at their usual pace around two
cones 1.5 m (5 feet) apart (39). The F8W has good test­retest
reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84) and inter-
rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90) and
is a valid measure of walking skills among older adults (39).
Short Physical Performance Battery.--The SPPB is
a reliable and valid measure of lower extremity perfor-
mance and predictive for subsequent disability, mortality,
and institutionalization among community-dwelling older
adults (18,32). The SPPB is a composite score of standing
balance, walking speed and the ability to rise from a chair.
Each test is scored between 0 to 4 points with a maximum
total score of 12. Clinically meaningful differences for the
SPPB have been reported as 0.3­0.8 points (minimal differ-
ence) and 0.8­1.5 points (substantial difference) (37).
Late Life Function and Disability Index.--The Late Life
Function and Disability Index assesses functioning in a vari-
ety of daily activities (40) and is associated with performance-
based measures of function (41). The function component
of the Late Life Function and Disability Index assesses self-
reported difficulty in performing 32 physical activities. Scores
on the Late Life Function and Disability Index are transformed
to scaled scores (0­100) with higher scores indicating better
levels of functioning (40). The subdomains of basic lower
extremity (BLE) function and advanced lower extremity func-
tion were used in this study. BLE consists of 14 items includ-
ing the ability to walk around the home, and advanced lower
extremity consists of 11 items including abilities such as hik-
ing a few miles. The Late Life Function and Disability Index
has been validated in different cohorts of older adults (40­42).
Statistics
Descriptive analyses are presented as means with stand-
ard deviations for continuous variables and as frequencies
1514 Pedersen et al.
and percentages for categorical variables. For determining
differences between two groups (MCI vs No-MCI), the
Student's t test was used for normally distributed continu-
ous variables, the Mann­Whitney U test for nonnormally
distributed continuous variables, and the 2 test for categori-
cal variables. Associations between each mobility measure
and cognitive status were examined by analysis of variance
and analysis of covariance comparing MCI versus No-MCI.
First, we adjusted for gender, race, and education. Second,
cognitive status was entered into similar models as a cat-
egorical variable (aMCI, mdMCI, naMCI, and No-MCI),
and estimates for differences in physical performance meas-
ures between all MCI categories were calculated. Goodness
of fit was investigated and physical performance measures
were log-transformed where necessary. The F8W was
transformed, and transformation was successful in achiev-
ing a normal distribution. Coefficients from these models
are given as back-transformed 2-coefficients. As part of a
post hoc analysis, we also adjusted for current health sta-
tus and chronic conditions. Also, in an additional analysis,
we included baseline MMSE status as a categorical variable
to explore whether the distribution of low MMSE (MMSE
< 24) significantly modified the association between the
respective MCI subtypes and mobility. An alpha value of
0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data
were analyzed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The 430 participants had an average age of 76.6 (SD =
7 years), two thirds were women, 16% had aMCI, 23% had
mdMCI, and 4% had naMCI. Participants with MCI did
not differ from those without MCI according to age, gen-
der, and body mass index (p > .05), but a significant differ-
ence was seen in race, education, and current health status,
whereby MCI was associated with poorer self-rated health
(p < .01; Table 1).
MCI Versus No-MCI
Participants with MCI performed significantly worse in
tests of mobility performance than participants without MCI
(eg, HGS:  = -0.13, p < .01; SPPB:  = -1.39, p < .01),
and these relationships were unchanged after adjusting for
sex, race, and education (p < .01; Table 2). Similar results
were observed in the associations of MCI with self-reported
functional performance. Goodness of fit was acceptable for
all measures except the F8W, which was log-transformed
resulting in normally, distributed residuals.
MCI Subtypes Versus No-MCI
All MCI subtypes performed significantly worse than
No-MCI on all mobility measures (p < .05), after adjusting
for gender, race, and education, except for aMCI, which did
not differ from No-MCI on F8W and BLE (Table 3).
Comparisons Between MCI Subtypes
Compared with patients with amnestic MCI, those with
nonamnestic MCI performed more poorly on a number of
mobility tests, for example, the SPPB (p = .01) and BLE (p
= .04), and borderline significance was seen in both walk-
ing tests, for HGS (p = .08) and F8W (p = .08). Similarly,
compared with patients with aMCI, those with mdMCI per-
formed 21% worse on F8W (2 = 1.21; p < .001) and scored
1.07 points lower on SPPB ( = 1.07, p < .01; Table 3). No
statistically significant differences were observed between
mdMCI and naMCI.
All multiple models were evaluated with the addition
of current health status as an adjustment variable. The
major findings were not materially altered; however, the
-estimates were diminished, and the difference in BLE
between aMCI and naMCI was no longer statistically sig-
nificant ( = 5.53, p = .11; Supplementary Appendix 1).
Similar findings were observed after adjusting for chronic
conditions instead of health status. Also, adjustment for
MMSE categories did not materially alter our findings.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to com-
pare primary care patients with and without MCI across a
broad range of mobility measures. The major findings of
our study are (a) patients with MCI manifested consistently
worse mobility performance compared with those without
MCI across both performance-based and self-report meas-
ures of mobility and (b) when evaluating patients by MCI
subtypes in relation to no MCI, these same associations
held, though important differences were observed with
use of certain mobility outcomes and among comparisons
between certain MCI subtypes.
Our findings are consistent with prior studies reporting
associations between MCI and gait speed (10,11) and add
to the existing literature by showing associations between
MCI and a broader range of mobility measures, including
both performance-based and self-report measures. The fact
that these relationships held within both performance-based
and self-reported mobility outcomes is important as perfor-
mance-based and self-reported functional measures have
been demonstrated to assess different aspects of an individ-
ual's functioning (43). Interestingly, in differentiating MCI
from No-MCI (Table 2), differences in HGS (0.12 m/s)
and SPPB (1.35 points) surpassed clinically meaningful
thresholds (37), which emphasizes the possible suitability
of these measures as supplemental screening tools in MCI.
Clinically meaningful differences have not yet been defined
for F8W, BLE, and advanced lower extremity.
In general, subtypes of MCI performed worse than
No-MCI on most mobility measures. Moreover, consistent
Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mobility 1515
with the findings seen between those with and without
MCI, the differences in HGS (0.09 m/s) and SPPB (0.71
points) surpassed the threshold of clinical meaningfulness
when comparing each of the subtypes of MCI to those
without MCI. In addition, some of the mobility meas-
ures differed between specific MCI subtypes. Participants
with nonamnestic MCI performed significantly worse
on SPPB and BLE than participants with amnestic MCI.

Further, participants with multiple MCI performed worse
on F8W and SPPB than those with amnestic MCI alone.
Thus, older persons with nonamnestic impairments, char-
acterized by problems with processing speed and execu-
tive function, performed worse on mobility measures
including performance-based tests and self-report meas-
ures. These findings are consistent both with a study by
Bombin and coworkers (44), indicating that people with
multiple domain MCI are more impaired than those with
amnestic MCI and with prior studies linking executive
dysfunction to disability (11,12,45). Also, in prior studies,
F8W has been linked to visual scanning and set-shifting
abilities (14) and HGS performance to executive function
(9,12). These findings suggest that HGS and F8W may be
linked to distinct patterns of cognitive impairment. Also,
poorer mobility among different MCI subtypes may be due
to greater severity or different patterns of peripheral neu-
romuscular impairments that underlie mobility. This was
demonstrated in an analysis of gait analysis parameters
conducted by Verghese and coworkers (11). They found
that nonamnestic MCI was more related to gait parameters
associated with pace of walking, whereas amnestic MCI
was more associated with rhythm and variability param-
eters. Our study adds to this evidence by including a vari-
ety of both performance-based and self-reported mobility
tests compared with a clinical assessment of one aspect
of mobility, that being gait. An investigation of the sever-
ity and pattern of peripheral neuromuscular attributes, like
that performed by Verghese and coworkers, was beyond
the scope of this investigation but can be evaluated within
future analyses of the Boston RISE cohort.
Of note, those with naMCI reported poorer health sta-
tus and manifested more chronic conditions than other
subtypes, which may explain their poorer performance.
However, after adjusting for current health status, naMCI
still performed significantly worse than aMCI on the more
complex performance-based mobility measure, SPPB, sug-
gesting that part of the difference in performance between
the two groups is likely due to different cognitive deficits.
Our results have important clinical implications. Within
a population-based study of community-dwelling older
adults (26), the prevalence of coexisting cognitive impair-
ment and slow gait was 7%. Our findings suggest that the
rate of cognitive impairment is much higher among primary
care patients undergoing screening for mobility problems.
Given the likely progression from MCI to dementia (8) and
the knowledge that coexisting cognitive impairment and
mobility limitations increases the risk of institutionaliza-
tion(3), early detection of these patients is critical for ini-
tiating preventative and ameliorative therapies. One mode
of therapy that can improve mobility is exercise and reha-
bilitative care (46,47). However, patients with cognitive dis-
abilities have commonly been excluded from large clinical

Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mobility 1517
therapy requires a capacity to learn; yet, learning may be
challenged if MCI is present. Therefore, rehabilitative care
paradigms for older adults with mobility problems should
be developed that account for common types of MCI and
the specific cognitive deficits indicated.
Limitations
Our study is cross-sectional and therefore we cannot infer a
causal association between cognitive impairment and mobil-
ity limitations. Furthermore, the study was observational and
therefore we might have missed some confounders. However,
the estimates did not change meaningfully when adjusting
for known confounders. The standardized scores used in the
determination of MCI were not adjusted for education, which
could influence the association between MCI and function.
However, we did adjust for education in the multiple regres-
sion analyses. Our sample size was small for some MCI
subtypes and corresponding analyses may not have been suf-
ficiently powered to observe true differences between these
groups. However, even given these small sample sizes, the
differences between subgroups were statistically significant,
and our hypotheses were predefined. Our study sample is rep-
resentative of older adults, who had at least some evidence of
mobility problems and were living within a 10-mile radius
of our center, and may not generalize to older adults residing
in other regions. It is possible that our sample included some
individuals with mild dementia. However, we attempted to
screen out those with moderate to severe dementia by using a
MMSE cut point of 18 and our entry criteria required partici-
pants to have the ability to live and function independently
in the community. Moreover, when adjusting for MMSE as
part of a post hoc analysis, the findings were not materially
altered, suggesting the burden of cognitive impairment had a
minimal influence on the findings. Lastly, the neuropsycho-
logical battery utilized was circumscribed and did not evalu-
ate other aspects of cognition that may be relevant to mobility
(ie, visuoconstructional skills). Thus, there is the possibility
that some individuals were misclassified with regard to MCI
subtype. Despite these potential limitations, our study pro-
vides a unique contribution to the literature because of its
design within primary care and use of a broad range of clini-
cally feasible mobility measures.
Conclusions
Among older primary care patients, performance on a
broad range of mobility measures is associated with MCI
status. Performance is worse among those with MCI, and
these differences extend across different MCI subtypes,
appearing to be poorest among those with nonamnestic
MCI.
