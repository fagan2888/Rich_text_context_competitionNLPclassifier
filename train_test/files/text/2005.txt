Scaling of body composition to height: relevance to height-normalized
indexes1­3
Steven B Heymsfield, Moonseong Heo, Diana Thomas, and Angelo Pietrobelli
ABSTRACT
Background: Body weight scales to height with a power of '2,
thus forming the basis of body mass index (weight/height2). The
corresponding scaling of body composition to height has not been
established in a representative sample of US adults.
Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the scaling of
weight, fat, fat-free mass, and bone mineral content to height.
Design: Adult non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black
(NHB), and Mexican American National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were included in al-
lometric analyses if they had complete age, weight, height, and
body-composition data as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry. Powers of height in allometric regression models were de-
veloped for each measure and adjusted for age.
Results: The analyses included 13,183 subjects (6699 NHW, 3015
NHB, and 3469 Mexican American). The scaling of weight to
height across sex-race groups provided powers (mean 6 SE) rang-
ing from 1.85 6 0.12 in Mexican American women to 2.48 6 0.17
in Mexican American men. Powers of height for body composition
similarly ranged widely and were often outside the 95% CI for
a power of 2. Of the 3 body-composition measures, the mean
age-adjusted powers of height rounded to 2 as the nearest integer
in 16 of 18 sex-race groups.
Conclusions: Adult weight and body composition scale to height with
variable age-adjusted powers that are sometimes outside the 95% CI
for a power of 2 but frequently round to 2 as the nearest integer. These
observations have implications for developing height-adjusted body-
composition indexes. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;93:736­40.
INTRODUCTION
Body mass index (BMI; weight/height2) is now universally
applied as a measure of human adiposity (1­4). This approach is
founded on 2 main assumptions: that adult body weight scales
approximately as height2 (2, 3) and that once weight is adjusted
for height2, adults within each sex group have approximately the
same proportion of body weight as fat, independent of height (2,
5, 6). This critical second assumption implies that fat and related
fat-free mass (FFM) (ie, weight 2 fat) also scale similar to
weight as approximately height2. Despite the importance of this
hypothesis, few studies have examined how fat and fat-free mass
(FFM) scale to height, particularly in a large well-defined
sample with a broad range of characteristics as might apply in
the general population. In addition, new and improved methods
are providing estimates of these 2 compartments among pop-
ulations and in individuals with the expanded use of body-
composition indexes (fat/height2 and FFM/height2) aimed at con-
trolling for between-subject differences in height (7, 8).
Recent small-scale studies suggest that FFM and related
skeletal muscle and bone mineral mass scale to height with
powers approximating 2 (2). Bone mineral, a measure of skeletal
weight, tended to scale minimally higher to height than FFM and
skeletal muscle mass in these studies (2), although the differ-
ences in power were not large (ie, height'2.3 compared with
height'2.0). In support of this observation, mammalian skeletal
weight scales approximately as weight1.1 and predicts that hu-
man bone mineral will scale to height with powers larger than
those for FFM and skeletal muscle mass (9). Fat mass in these
small studies did not scale significantly to height, and there is no
physiologic basis for the presence of a significant association
between percentage body weight as fat and stature (2, 5, 6). On
the assumption that percentage of body weight as fat is in-
dependent of height, fat mass should then also scale as height2.
The 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) included body-composition measurements by dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on a large and diverse
sample of noninstitutionalized US adults and children (10, 11).
These recently released observations provide the important op-
portunity to critically test the hypothesis that fat, FFM, and bone
mineral scale approximately as height2 in a large and diverse
sample representative of the US population. Our focus was to
test this hypothesis in adult (age 18 y) NHANES participants.

the body-composition values, as was done for the NHANES data,
had no effect on the outcome of the height powers as reported in
the current study. The NHANES study group collected the whole-
body DXA data using 3 mobile examination centers between
1999 and 2004; compiled data were released on the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/nhanes.htm). The present study sample included all adults
aged 18 y who had complete demographic information (sex,
age, weight, height, and race). Women were excluded from the
DXA examination if they had a positive pregnancy test at the
time of the evaluation or were currently pregnant. Both men and
women were excluded if their reported weight or height ex-
ceeded the DXA scan table limits of 300 lb (136 kg) and 77
inches (196 cm), respectively. The 3 largest NHANES race
groupings were analyzed and included non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. We analyzed the
body-composition scaling relations to height within each sex
and race group with exclusion of the other smaller race cate-
gories. Three components were evaluated in the current analysis
in addition to body weight, fat mass, FFM, and bone mineral
content. We also included an analysis of bone mineral density as
measured by DXA.
Statistical methods
For all statistical analyses, we took into account sampling
strata, primary sampling units, and sampling weights, which are
elements of the multistage cluster sampling design of NHANES
III (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). In particular, the
sampling weights to the pooled NHANES data from 1999 to 2004
were reassessed in accordance with the NHANES data analysis
guideline (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_03_04/
nhanes_analytic_guidelines_dec_2005.pdf). We applied SAS
PROC SURVEYMEANS for descriptive statistics and SAS
PROC SURVEYREG for the allometric modeling (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). Furthermore, a large portion of the NHANES DXA
measurement data were missing and were thus imputed 5 times
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS; http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm); we applied descriptive sta-
tistics and the allometric modeling to each imputed data set,
which yielded 5 results for each analysis. These 5 results were
pooled into a single final result for each analysis based on the
pooling method proposed by Rubin (12).
The age-adjusted association between body weight and body-
composition measures with height can be described by the
allometric model Y = aXbc, where Y is the outcome, X is the
predictor variable (ie, height), b is the scaling exponent (ie,
power), Z is the age covariate with power c, and a is the pro-
portionality constant (13). The simple allometric model can be
expressed in logarithmic form as loge
Y = loge
a + bloge
X + c
loge
Z + e, where e is the error term. Weight and body-
composition measures, expressed in loge
form, were set as
dependent variables and height and age as independent varia-
bles in the regression models. Five values are presented
for each developed multiple regression model: a (intercept), b
(height), c (age), R2, and P value. We also present height
powers 6 SE in the text for the evaluated measures within each
sex and race group. Subject demographic characteristics are
presented as means 6 SEMs. Statistical significance was de-
clared when a 2-sided P value was ,0.05.
RESULTS
Subjects
The characteristics of the subjects at baseline are shown in
Table 1. The sample included 6696 men: 3419 non-Hispanic
whites, 1504 non-Hispanic blacks, and 1773 Mexican Ameri-
cans. The non-Hispanic white men were older than the other 2
groups of men, whereas the Mexican American men were
shorter than the other 2 groups of men. The 3 groups of men had
similar BMIs ('28). The sample also included 6487 women:
3280 non-Hispanic whites, 1511 non-Hispanic blacks, and 1696
Mexican Americans. A similar age and height pattern was
present across the 3 race groups of women, as was observed in
the men. The non-Hispanic black women had the highest group
mean BMI ('31), the Mexican American women had an in-
termediate BMI ('29), whereas the non-Hispanic white women
had a mean BMI similar to that of the men ('28). Although the
actual number of included subjects depends on the outcome
variables because of missing data (for some subjects, even im-
putation was not considered reasonable), only a small number of
subjects (,2%) were excluded from the analysis for every
combination of sex, race, and body-composition measure.

Allometric analyses
The results of allometric analyses are summarized in Table 2.
Height and age were statistically significant in all prediction
models unless otherwise noted.
Weight
After adjustment for age, weight scaled to height; mean (6SE)
powers ranged from 2.11 6 0.12 in non-Hispanic white men to
2.48 6 0.14 in Mexican American men. Weight scaled to height;
powers ranged from 1.72 6 0.09 in non-Hispanic white women
to 1.95 6 0.17 in non-Hispanic black women.
FFM
As for weight, FFM scaled with powers that were higher in
men than in the corresponding groups of women (Figure 1). The
range of height powers for FFM was similar to that observed
for weight: from 1.86 6 0.06 in non-Hispanic white women to
2.32 6 0.12 in the non-Hispanic black men. The R2 values were
almost double for FFM models than for the corresponding val-
ues for weight, and the SEEs were also smaller.
Fat
Fat scaled to height with powers that tended to be greater than
for FFM in men, ranging from 2.22 6 0.22 in non-Hispanic
white men to 2.98 6 0.31 in Mexican American men. Fat scaled
to height in women with powers ranging from 1.51 6 0.17 in
non-Hispanic white women to 1.94 6 0.29 in non-Hispanic
black women.
Bone mineral
Bone mineral content scaled to height with the smallest range
of powers among the measured compartments, from 2.07 6 0.08
in non-Hispanic black women to 2.41 6 0.12 in non-Hispanic
black men. The powers of height for weight and the 3 body
compartments are shown in Figure 1 for the sex and race groups.
Most of the measures, as is also evident in Table 2, scaled ap-
proximately at or modestly above or below a height power of 2.
Only one height power reached 3: fat mass in Mexican Amer-
ican men.
The 95% CIs for the powers of height are also presented in
Figure 1. The 95% CIs for 7 of 12 measures in women included
a height power of 2, whereas the 95% CI for 4 of the 12 measures
in men included a height power of 2. The 95% CIs for bone
mineral content ranged between 1.9 and 2.6 and had the smallest
95% CI among the measures. Fat had the largest 95% CI for the
power of height, ranging between 1.2 and 3.6. Of the 24 total
measures, 22 rounded to 2 as the nearest integer. Of the 18 body-
composition measures, 16 rounded to 2 as the nearest integer.
The powers observed for fat and FFM scaled to height tended
to track with each other and, as expected, with powers of body
weight scaled to height (Table 2). For example, the lowest power
of weight scaled to height was observed for non-Hispanic white
women (1.72) who also had the lowest model power of FFM
(1.86) and the lowest power for fat (1.51). The highest power of
weight scaled to height was observed for Mexican American men

(2.48), who also had the highest model powers for fat (2.98) and
the second highest model powers for FFM (2.27).
Bone mineral density also scaled significantly to height, after
adjustment for age, across sex and race groups (Table 2). All of the
observed height powers were ,1, ranging from 0.47 6 0.07 in non-
Hispanic black women to 0.71 6 0.04 in non-Hispanic black men.
DISCUSSION
The current study explored the scaling of body weight and
composition to height in a large, carefully collected database
including 3 race groups of adult NHANES subjects. After
adjusting for age and applying the simple allometric model, we
found that body weight and body composition for most sex and
race groups scaled to height, with powers at or modestly above
a value of 2. These observations confirm and extend the findings
of several earlier smaller studies (2, 3, 6). Body composition--
notably fat, FFM, and bone mineral content--thus scale to height,
with powers approximately similar to those observed for body
weight. As expected, the highly variable fat mass compartment
had the weakest model associations with height (R2 = 0.1­0.2)
whereas stronger model correlations were observed between
FFM and bone mineral content with height (R2 = 0.2­0.4).
Whereas these generalities prevail, notable exceptions were
observed within the 6 sex and race groups. The powers of height
observed for men across body weight and composition tended to
scale somewhat higher than those for women--an observation
made earlier by others (2, 3, 14). Fat mass scaled to height in
Mexican American men with a power of '3, which strongly
influenced the observed power of weight scaled to height (2.5).
The effect of fat scaling on body weight scaling occurs because
the power of weight scaled to height reflects the weighted
powers of fat and FFM. Moreover, FFM is tethered with fat
mass, and the 2 increase according to the "companionship" rule
first described by Forbes (14). Thus, the powers of height for all
3 measures (weight, fat, and FFM) tended to group together
within each sex and race group as shown Table 2.
The scaling of weight and body composition to height as
examined in our report and earlier studies are based on empirical
correlations (6, 15). A volumetric or "isometric" expansion of
individual body compartments and the sum of all compartments
with greater height would yield powers approximating 3 (15).
Inclusion of children older than '8 y with adults in these kinds
of analyses provides powers in the range of 3 and several weight
indexes other than BMI incorporate height3 elements (6).
However, maximal correlations were observed between adult
adiposity and weight/height2 compared with these other meas-
ures, as first reported by Keys et al (1) and largely confirmed in
several other studies (2, 3). However, the height power of 2 is
not a hard-and-fast rule, as shown by the Mexican American
men in the current study. Within that group, optimal scaling of
fat mass to height would approach powers closer to 3 than to 2.
Moreover, fat/height2 would not be independent of height in the
Mexican American men; rather, tall Mexican American men in
NHANES have a greater fat/height2 and percentage fat than do
their short counterparts. The reason that percentage fat also
scales positively to height in the Mexican American men is
because percentage fat resolves to fat/weight and fat } H'3,
weight } height'2.5, and thus percentage fat (ie, fat/weight) }
height'0.5.
As with FFM as a whole, bone mineral content models were
significantly associated with height and included height powers in
the narrow range of '2.1­2.4. Our original expectation, based
on an earlier study (2), was that bone mineral content would
scale to height with powers greater than those for body weight
and FFM. Whereas to some extent that was the case, bone
mineral content height scaling powers appeared largely un-
related to the larger FFM compartment and body weight as
a whole. The skeleton, of which bone mineral is a major and
reasonably constant fractional component (16), may thus be the
body compartment with the strongest link to adult height and
a stable compartment with slow turnover compared with soft
tissue compartments. For example, at least in the short term,
bone mineral content remains largely unchanged, even with
substantial voluntary loss of body weight (17).
Bone mineral density, while not a major focus of the current
study, also was larger with greater adult height across all sex and
race groups. Areal bone mineral density, as measured by DXA, is
calculated as bone mineral content divided by bone area. Our
findings thus suggest that bone mineral content and bone mineral
area scale differently to height, with the result that areal bone
mineral density increases with greater stature. For example, our
model for 50-y-old non-Hispanic white women predicts a bone
mineral density of 1.05 g/cm2 and 1.19 g/cm2 for heights of
5 feet (152 cm) and 6 feet (183 cm), respectively. The mean
(6 SD) bone mineral density in this group of women is 1.10 6
0.10. Similar observations were reported by Kelley et al (7),
which are also based on the NHANES database. If and how this
calculated bone mineral density relates to actual physical
properties of bone and fracture risk remains uncertain.
With respect to the validity of the regression model after the
log transformation, we visually inspected Studentized residual
plots against both predicted values and loge
(age). Although these
residuals were obtained ignoring the complex sampling design
of the NHANES data, the linearity assumptions underlying the
regression model appeared to be well supported for every out-
come variable of loge
(Y) across sex and race. Furthermore,
Studentized residual plots against loge
(age) did not show any
prominent nonlinear pattern supporting the linear relation be-
tween ln(Y) and ln(age) in particular. In addition, although the
regression models can be extended to test whether the exponents
of height are significantly different across sex and race, this
testing was not the main objective of the present study. This test
should, however, be a separate future study topic.
Implications
In a classic article, Benn (5) suggested adjusting weight for
height as weight/heightp, with the exponent value of p specific to
the population of interest. Whereas the powers of height shown in
Table 2 could be used for this purpose when applied to body
compartments, the high variability of p values makes this ap-
proach impractical on a large scale. Moreover, the values of
p may not always be known, as in the case of studying or clini-
cally managing a small sample of non-US adults. A simple and
practical alternative is to round powers to the nearest integer,
which would be a value of 2 for 16 of 18 body-composition
measures across sex and race groups based on the current study
findings (Figure 1). This assumption is the basis of BMI and,
notably, when weight is scaled to height not all powers are

exactly 2 as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. The main penalty of
assuming a power of 2 when the compartment of interest scales
to heights . or ,2 is shown graphically in Figure 2 for the non-
Hispanic white men. The correlation coefficients for fat/Hp
(unadjusted for age) compared with height were derived in in-
crements of 0.2 between powers of 1.4 and 4. The developed
nonage-adjusted regression line crosses the horizontal axis at the
power (ie, value of p) of '1.7, indicating the approximate value
of p that makes fat/Hp independent of height. Values of p above
or below this critical power will produce fat mass indexes that
correlate positively or negatively with height. This effect would
introduce bias into body composition­height indexes, and the
importance of this effect would need to be considered with each
specific application. Similarly, BMI is significantly correlated
with height in these men, although only after adjustment for age
(r for BMI compared with height: 0.025; NS; with age added to
the model: r = 0.082, P , 0.001 with positive height power
covariate significant at 0.01). A balance could be struck between
expedience with rounding of powers to the nearest whole integer
for population use as with BMI (ie, height2) and accuracy by
adjusting between-subject differences in body composition for
height in small-scale research studies by using statistical ap-
proaches such as regression analysis.
Conclusions
The 2004 NHANES database provided, in the current study,
a unique opportunity to critically examine the scaling of 3 major
body compartments (fat, FFM, and bone mineral content) to
height. The 3 compartments generally scale similarly, with
several exceptions, as body weight does to height with powers
ranging between '2 and 2.5. Powers within sex and race groups
tended to rank similarly for fat and FFM, and thus body weight,
as would be expected based on Forbes' companionship rule
(14). Our findings have implications for developing height-
normalized body-composition indexes, with 2 main potential
options: divide body compartment mass by Hp, with population-
specific values of p applied as defined in Table 2; round powers
for practical application to the nearest whole number, which
for most (16 of 18) of the evaluated body-composition measures
is a value of 2. Although the second approach is simple, it
is limited by the introduction of height bias in the height-
normalized index of interest, the importance of which needs to
be judged on the specific application.

FIGURE 2. Correlation coefficients from data in non-Hispanic white men
for the regression of fat mass/heightp compared with height for values of p
ranging from 1.4 to 4 in increments of 0.2. Simple linear regression analysis,
the exponent of height, was used to generate the line y = 20.11x + 0.19 (R2 =
0.99, P , 0.001). The regression line crosses the horizontal axis at a power
of '1.7, which indicates the value of p that makes fat/heightp independent of
height; p values . or , '1.7 will produce fat mass indexes that correlate
positively or negatively with height.
