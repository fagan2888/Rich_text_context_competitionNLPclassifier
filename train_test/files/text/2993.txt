TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN
medicine and improvements in
public health have enabled
Americans to live longer and to
survive potentially life-threatening
events such as childbirth, infectious dis-
ease, and injury. A result of these ad-
vances has been the emergence of se-
rious chronic diseases as a major
pathway toward death.
Among the most common chronic
diseases are chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), congestive
heart failure (CHF), and end-stage liver
disease (ESLD). Together, these 3 dis-
eases account for almost 2 million hos-
pitalizations and more than 175 000
deaths annually.1,2 In contrast to incur-
able metastatic cancer, in which there
is often a marked decline in weight and
function near the end of life,3 diseases
involving chronic organ failure tend to
have a more erratic course and to pro-
duce death at a time that is difficult to
predict.4-6 As a result, many patients
with COPD, CHF, or ESLD never ex-
perience a time during which they are

Context Many individuals involved with care of the dying advocate expanding ac-
cess to hospice care for persons with advanced lung, heart, or liver disease. However,
to be eligible, these patients generally must have a prognosis for survival of less than
6 months.
Objective To test the ability of currently available criteria to identify a population
with a survival prognosis of 6 months or less among seriously ill hospitalized patients
with 1 of 3 commonly fatal chronic diseases.
Design Validation study using data from the Study to Understand Prognoses and
Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) phase 1 (June 1989-
June 1991) and phase 2 (January 1992-January 1994), with a 6-month follow-up.
Setting and Patients Consecutive sample of 2607 seriously ill patients from 5 US
medical centers who were hospitalized with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
congestive heart failure, or end-stage liver disease, and who survived to hospital dis-
charge.
Main Outcome Measures Descriptive and operating characteristics of 5 general
and 2 disease-specific clinical criteria for identifying patients with a survival prognosis
of 6 months or less, and 3 sets of combination criteria (broad, intermediate, and nar-
row inclusion) aimed at providing low, medium, and high thresholds for hospice eli-
gibility based on National Hospice Organization guidelines.
Results Seventy-five percent of the sample survived more than 6 months after hos-
pital discharge; 44% expressed a preference for palliative care. Broad inclusion crite-
ria identified 923 patients eligible for hospice care, of whom 70% survived longer than
6 months. Intermediate inclusion criteria identified 300 patients, of whom 65% sur-
vived longer than 6 months. Narrow inclusion criteria identified 19 patients, of whom
53% survived longer than 6 months. Sensitivities and specificities of the combination
criteria were 41.7% and 66.7% (broad inclusion), 16.2% and 90.1% (intermediate
inclusion), and 1.4% and 99.5% (narrow inclusion), respectively.
Conclusions These data indicate that for seriously ill hospitalized patients with ad-
vanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or end-stage
liver disease, recommended clinical prediction criteria are not effective in identifying a
population with a survival prognosis of 6 months or less.

clearly dying of their disease. This ob-
servation has important implications for
the treatment of patients with such dis-
eases, especially with regard to their eli-
gibility for hospice care.
HospiceprogramsintheUnitedStates
provide specialized medical and sup-
port services for the management of ter-
minal illness, mostly in patients' homes.
The Medicare hospice benefit covers
comprehensiveservices,includinghome
care, short-term inpatient care, and
medication costs, and is paid at a daily
capitation rate of approximately $100.7
Hospicecareisalsoacoveredbenefitun-
der most private insurance plans, man-
aged care organizations, and state Med-
icaid programs.8 Hospice care has
received widespread approval9,10 and is
increasing in popularity; in the last 5
years, annual growth in the number of
patients receiving hospice care nation-
wide has averaged 16%.8 The few stud-
ies comparing hospice with other care
at the end of life suggest that (1) pa-
tients11 and families are satisfied with
hospice care, (2) patients have fewer
regrets than nonhospice patients, and
(3) patients receiving hospice care are
more likely to die in a way that is con-
sistent with their wishes.12,13
Despite its advantages, however, hos-
pice care serves a small portion of the
dying population for only a short pe-
riod of time. About 20% of patients who
die in the United States receive hos-
pice care.7 Most patients enrolled in
hospice are dying of cancer, although
the proportion of hospice admissions
for other diseases has increased steadily
in recent years.8
Under Medicare regulations, a ben-
eficiary is eligible for hospice care cov-
erage only if both the patient's attend-
ing physician and the medical director
of the hospice certify that "the indi-
vidual's prognosis is for a life expec-
tancy of 6 months or less if the termi-
nal illness runs its normal course."14
Surprisingly, the precise meaning of this
definition has never been explicated and
remains unclear.15,16 For example, the
phrase "a life expectancy of 6 months
or less if the terminal illness runs its
normal course" could be interpreted to
mean that among patients with simi-
lar prognosis, more than half would be
dead within6months.Alternatively,the
phrase could be interpreted to require
a much higher degree of prognostic ac-
curacy (eg, 80% or 90% of patients
would be dead within 6 months).
Aggregate Medicare survival data
suggest that actual practice tends to re-
flect the latter, narrower interpreta-
tion.6 Only 15% of patients receiving
Medicare hospice benefits survive
longer than 6 months. The median sur-
vival of Medicare patients enrolled in
hospice is under 40 days.17 Govern-
ment regulators, too, may expect a high
level of accuracy in predicting 6-month
survival--not only in terms of aggre-
gate patient data, but also at the level
of individual patients. Fraud and abuse
auditors acting for the Department of
Health and Human Services Office of
the Inspector General have begun in-
vestigating hospices and requiring re-
payment to Medicare for some pa-
tients who survived for more than 6
months.18 The Institute of Medicine's
Committee on Care at the End of Life
voiced its concern that regulators "may
not understand the uncertainty inher-
ent in projecting survival,"19 and that
the Medicare prognosis provision "im-
plies a degree of precision that does not
exist."20 As the National Hospice Or-
ganization (NHO) has pointed out, "the
Office of the Inspector General's in-
tense scrutiny has had a chilling effect
on appropriate referrals of terminally
ill beneficiaries."21 The effect has been
especially pronounced in patients dy-
ing of chronic conditions whose courses
are difficult to predict.20
The comparatively predictable final
courseofcancer--withits1-to2-month
phase of progressive decline at the end
of life--is well suited to the hospice
model of care.3 But for individuals dy-
ing of diseases other than cancer, ac-
cess has been limited, in part because
they rarely manifest a discrete phase of
inexorable decline at the end of life.5
Nonetheless, many have suggested that
hospice care be expanded to manage the
care of persons dying of chronic dis-
eases such as COPD, CHF, amyotro-
phic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer
disease.22-26
Inanefforttoclarifyeligibilityforhos-
pice care among patients with CHF,
COPD, and other serious illnesses, the
NHO has drafted guidelines for deter-
mining prognosis in selected noncan-
cer diseases.23 The guidelines were cre-
atedbyanexpertpanelafteranextensive
review of the medical literature con-
cerning short-term mortality in noncan-
cer diseases. They were intended as a
startingpointfordeterminingpatienteli-
gibility under the Medicare hospice ben-
efit, with the caveat that their accuracy
would need to be validated by future re-
search. Despite this, they have already
been widely accepted and used. In fact,
the Health Care Financing Administra-
tion has distributed NHO's guidelines to
its fiscal intermediaries as a tool to as-
sist in the claims process.27 These of-
fices have, in turn, used the guidelines
in developing the conditions under
which Medicare coverage for hospice
care is approved or denied.27
In this study, we applied a variety of
potential criteria for determining prog-
nosis, including those based on NHO
guidelines, to an existing database28 to
evaluate their accuracy in predicting
death within 6 months among seri-
ously ill patients with advanced chronic
disease.
METHODS
Study Population
This analysis used data from the Study
to Understand Prognoses and Prefer-
ences for Outcomes and Risks of Treat-
ments (SUPPORT).28 From June 1989
to June 1991 (phase 1) and from Janu-
ary 1992 to January 1994 (phase 2),
SUPPORT enrolled patients, 18 years
or older, who met specific criteria for
1 of 9 serious illnesses (nontraumatic
coma, acute respiratory failure, multi-
organ system failure with sepsis or ma-
lignancy, COPD, CHF, cirrhosis, meta-
static colon cancer, or inoperable nonÂ­
small cell lung cancer) and who were
admitted to 1 of 5 medical centers (Beth

ter, Durham, NC; St Joseph's Hospi-
tal, Marshfield, Wis; and the Univer-
sity of California Los Angeles Medical
Center). Inclusion criteria were de-
signed to result in a group of patients
with an aggregate mortality rate of 50%
within 6 months. Patients were ex-
cluded if they died or were discharged
within 48 hours of study enrollment,
were admitted with a scheduled dis-
charge within 72 hours, did not speak
English, or had acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome, multiple trauma, or
pregnancy.
In this analysis we focused on pa-
tients with COPD, CHF, or ESLD. In-
clusion criteria for COPD were clinical
diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis,
chronic obstructive lung disease, or em-
physema with breathlessness, respira-
tory failure, or mental status change
as the main reason for hospital admis-
sion, and hypercapnia and hypoxemia
(PO2

50mmHg
if the patient was receiving room air, or
PCO2
50mmHgaloneifthepatientwas
receiving supplemental oxygen) docu-
mented at admission. Patients in status
asthmaticus were excluded.
Inclusion criteria for CHF were clini-
cal diagnosis of CHF or cardiomyop-
athy with an exacerbation of symptoms
as the primary reason for hospital ad-
mission and 1 of the following: (1) a his-
toryofsevereCHFatbaseline(NewYork
Heart Association class III or IV) mani-
fested by a history of dyspnea at rest or
with minimal exertion related to pri-
marycardiacfailure,andmedicationsbe-
fore admission that included at least 2
drug classes (diuretics, vasodilators, or
adrenocortical extract inhibitors); (2) a
history of class III or IV CHF at admis-
sion, dyspnea at rest, and systolic blood
pressure of 100 mg Hg or less, or a his-
tory of hypotension that precluded the
useofthesediuretics,vasodilators,orad-
renocortical extract inhibitors; or (3)
documentation of severe CHF with an
ejection fraction of 20% or less. Pa-
tients with CHF were excluded from the
study if they had any of the following:
severe COPD, shock, primary acute
renal failure, decreased systemic vascu-
lar resistance, restrictive cardiac dis-
ease, circulatory overload, CHF primar-
ily due to valvular heart disease, cardiac
surgery, or thoracotomy during cur-
rent hospitalization.
Inclusion criteria for ESLD were chart
documentation of cirrhosis and at least
2ofthefollowing:aserumalbuminlevel
of 30 g/L or less, a serum bilirubin level
of 51 Âµmol/L (3.0 mg/dL) or more, un-
controlled ascites, hepatic encephalopa-
thy, cachexia, or a massive gastrointes-
tinal tract bleed defined as transfusion of
2 or more units of blood in 24 hours and

Data Collection
All patients admitted to the 5 hospitals
were screened daily by trained research
nurses and those meeting disease and
severity criteria were enrolled. Proto-
cols for enrollment and data collection

boards at all participating hospitals.

ESLD patients, chart documentation of
cachexia (including wasting, malnour-
ishment, emaciation) was recorded.
During the first week after study en-
try, informed consent was obtained for
interviews with both patients and sur-
rogate decision makers. Interviews in-
cluded questions about the patient's
functional status 2 weeks prior to study
entry, weight change in the last 2
months, and preferences about pallia-
tive care. Functional status was mea-
sured by a modified version of the Katz
Index of Activities of Daily Living
Scale.30 The Activities of Daily Living
Scale ranged from 1 to 7 points and
measured impairment in bathing, dress-
ing, eating, continence, transferring, toi-
leting, and walking, with a higher score
indicating worse function. Preference
for palliative care was assessed by the
question, "If you had to make a choice
at this time, would you prefer a course
of treatment that focuses on extend-
ing life as much as possible, even if it
means having more pain and discom-
fort, or would you want a course of
treatment that focuses on relieving pain
and discomfort as much as possible,
even if that means not living as long?"
Prognostic Criteria
Variables tested in this analysis were
chosen to approximate the prognostic
criteria listed in the NHO's Medical
Guidelines for Determining Prognosis in
Selected Noncancer Diseases.23 The NHO
criteria were operationalized using the
SUPPORT data as summarized in
TABLE 1. Information was available rel-
evant to each proposed domain. In the
instancesthatdatafromSUPPORT were
insufficient, a proxy measure in the
same domain was substituted. Proxy
measures were selected to err on the
side of broader inclusion.
For each patient case, 7 variables were
analyzed. Of these, 5 were general clini-
cal criteria that applied to all patients
regardless of their disease category: re-
admission within 2 months, home care
after discharge, activities of daily liv-
ing dependency of 3 or more, weight
loss of 2.3 kg (5 lb) or more within 2
months, albumin level of less than 25
g/L. In addition, 2 disease-specific clini-
cal criteria were applied to each case:
cor pulmonale and PO2
of 55 mm Hg
or less while receiving oxygen in pa-
tients with COPD; ejection fraction of
20% or less and arrhythmia in pa-

a preference for palliative care, as con-
sent was always a prerequisite for hos-
pice enrollment. In addition to prefer-
ence for palliative care, the different
combination criteria required varying
numbers of the 7 possible clinical crite-
ria relevant to the disease. Broad inclu-
sion required at least 1, intermediate
inclusion required at least 3, and nar-
row inclusion required the presence of
5 of 7 possible clinical criteria.
In tabulating physiologic measure-
ments (PO2
, albumin, creatinine), we
used the most normal value if more than
1 were available. For the interview data
(preference for palliative care, use of
home care, activities of daily living de-
pendency, weight loss), surrogate re-
sponses were calibrated to patients'
responses and substituted if the pa-
tient was not interviewed but the sur-
rogate was. In this analysis, patient in-
formation was missing and surrogate
responses were substituted in 30.1% of
cases for these scores, while neither pa-
tient nor surrogate data were available
in 17.6% of cases. Patients with no in-
terview data did not differ signifi-
cantly from patients with interview data
in respect to disease severity, pre-
dicted prognosis, or actual survival.
Data Analysis
The relevant clinical criteria and the 3
different combinations of criteria were
applied to patients in each disease cat-
egory. For comparison, we also exam-
ined 6-month prognostic estimates of
50% or less and 10% or less by the
SUPPORT model,29 as well as actual re-
ferrals to hospice care. These analyses
were applied only to the subset of pa-
tients who survived the enrollment hos-
pitalization, as they were considered the
most likely candidates for hospice re-
ferral and, therefore, the group for
whom prognostic criteria would be rel-
evant in clinical practice.
Descriptive statistics were used to
characterize patients for each criterion
regarding survival days after discharge
fromtheindexhospitalization.Thenum-
ber of survival days was determined by
the National Death Index, updated to
December31,1994.Ifapatientwerestill
alive on this date, his/her survival time
was censored. The interquartiles of sur-
vival days for patients who met each cri-
terion were estimated using the Kaplan-
Meierestimator.Tofurtherelucidatethe
clinical usefulness of various methods
for identifying patients with a progno-
sis of 6 months or less, we calculated
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
negative likelihood ratios (LRs). In ad-
dition, we calculated the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve for the NHO guidelineÂ­based
criteria.
RESULTS
SUPPORT enrolled 9105 patients, of
whom 2954 were categorized with 1 of
the targeted advanced chronic dis-
Table 1. Operationalization of National Hospice Organization (NHO) General Guidelines for Determining Prognosis
NHO Guidelines Criteria Used in This Study
The patient should meet all of the following criteria:
I. The patient's condition is life limiting, and the patient and/or family have
been informed of this determination.
II. The patient and/or family have elected treatment goals directed toward
relief of symptoms, rather than curing the underlying disease.
III. The patient has either of the following:
A. Documented clinical progression of disease, which may include:
1. Progression of the primary disease process as listed in the
disease-specific criteria, as documented by serial physician
assessment, laboratory, radiologic, or other studies.
2. Multiple emergency department visits or inpatient hospitilizations
over the prior 6 months.
3. For homebound patients receiving home health services, nursing
assessment may be documented.
4. For patients who do not qualify under 1, 2, or 3, a recent decline
in functional status may be documented. Functional decline
should be recent. . . . Clinical judgment is required for patients
with impaired status due to a different non-terminal disease. . . .
Diminished functional status may be documented by either a
Karnofsky performance status of 50%, or dependence in at
least 3 of 6 activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, feeding,
transfers, continence of urine or stool, ability to ambulate
independently to bathroom).
B. Documented recent impaired nutritional status related to the terminal
process:
1. Unintentional, progressive weight loss of 10% over the prior
6 months.
2. Serum albumin 25 g/L may be a helpful prognostic indicator,
but should not be used in isolation from other factors above.
I. All Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes
and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) patients were hospitalized with a
serious life-limiting illness. The degree to which they understood this
was not systematically assessed.
II. The analogous measure used in this analysis was termed preference
for palliative care.
III. A. 1. Disease-specific criteria were selected from factors named in
NHO guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
congestive heart failure, excluding those that matched
SUPPORT inclusion criteria. For chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease we used evidence of cor pulmonale and hypoxemia
55% on supplemental oxygen. For congestive heart failure we
used ejection fraction 20% and supraventricular or ventricular
arrhythmia. The NHO guidelines do not specify criteria for
end-stage liver disease, but to parallel the other analyses we
chose documented cachexia and creatinine 153 Âµmol/L
(2.0 mg/dL).
2. SUPPORT did not collect data on the 6 months prior to
enrollment. Instead, we examined patients who were readmitted
to a SUPPORT hospital within 2 months of the first discharge.
3. Although home care nursing assessments were not available,
we were able to determine whether patients were prescribed
home care services after discharge.
4. SUPPORT did not collect data on how recently a decline in
functional status occurred. We used Katz index 3 (indicating
dependence in at least 3 of 7 activities of daily living) 2 weeks
prior as reported on patient or surrogate interviews.
B. 1. We used weight loss 2.3 kg (5 lb) in the preceding
2 months.
2. Albumin measurement was available for 605 patients.

bined data for all 3 diseases are sum-
marized here. Of the 2607 patients who
survived to leave the hospital and were
included in this study, 655 (25%) were
dead within 6 months of discharge. The
estimated median survival time for the
study population was 804 days (inter-
quartile range, 181 to . . . [not able to
calculate accurately]). A large minor-
ity of patients expressed a preference
for palliative care (44%). Those who did
express such a preference had an in-
creased probability of dying within 6
months. Each of the 5 general criteria
and the 2 disease-specific criteria we
tested also identified a subset of pa-
tients with a similar or slightly in-
creased risk of dying within 6 months.

for palliative care and 1 or more rel-
evantclinicalcriteria),923patientswere
identified, of whom 70% survived more
than 6 months after discharge. Using the
intermediate inclusion criteria (prefer-
ence for palliative care and 3 clinical
criteria),300patientswereidentifiedand
65% survived more than 6 months. Us-
ing the narrow inclusion criteria (pref-
erence for palliative care and 5 clini-
cal criteria), 19 patients were identified
and 53% survived more than 6 months.
The corresponding median survival
was 654 days (interquartile range, 129
to . . . [not able to calculate accu-
rately]) for broad inclusion, 418 days
(interquartile range, 89-1763) for inter-
mediate inclusion, and 183 days (inter-
quartile range, 65-474) for narrow in-
clusion.
Using the SUPPORT prognostic
model to estimate 6-month survival af-
ter discharge, we identified 313 pa-
tients whose prognosis was 50% or less
and 27 patients whose prognosis was
10% or less. Of those with a prognosis
of 50% or less, the actual 6-month sur-
vival rate was 54% and the median sur-
vival was 236 days (interquartile range,
46 to . . . [not able to calculate accu-
rately]). For those with a prognosis of
10% or less, 41% were still alive at 6
months, and the median survival was 67
days (interquartile range, 18-666).
TABLE 3 shows the characteristics of
the 54 patients whose medical records
documented a discharge to hospice care.
Compared with other patients in the
study,thosereferredtohospicecarewere
slightly older and more often white, but
similar with respect to sex. In the hos-
pice group, a higher proportion of pa-
tients had COPD or ESLD, while a lower
proportion had CHF. Patients dis-
charged to hospice programs were not
significantly more likely to meet the
broad, intermediate, or narrow inclu-
sion criteria. The SUPPORT prognostic
model predicted significantly lower
6-month survival rates for the hospice
care group. Actual median survival
among patients referred to hospice was
23 days (6-145), in contrast to 842 days
(200 to . . . [not able to calculate accu-
rately]) for other patients. The propor-
tion of patients in hospice who outlived
their 6-month prognosis was 22%.
TABLE 4 compares test characteris-
tics for predicting death within 6
months of hospital discharge for broad,
intermediate, and narrow inclusion cri-
teria based on NHO guidelines; for the
SUPPORT prognostic model; and for
actual discharges to hospice. For all the
criteria tested, the sensitivity was low.
For example, if intermediate inclu-
sion criteria were used to determine
hospice eligibility, only 16% of pa-
tients who were to die within 6 months
would have qualified. Specificity, how-
ever, was high, such that most pa-
tients surviving more than 6 months
would have been excluded.
Meeting the combination criteria we
used to simulate NHO guidelines would
increase a patient's chances of dying
within 6 months so slightly as to be of
limitedusefulnessclinically(positiveLRs
between 1.25 and 2.68). For example,

includedinthecurrentstudywouldhave
a prior probability of 25% for dying
within6months.Meetingthenarrowin-
clusioncriteria(positiveLR,2.68)would
give a posterior probability of 47%.
Changes of this magnitude are not suf-
ficient to establish "a life expectancy of
6 months or less."
A 6-month prognosis of 50% or less
or10%orlessaccordingtotheSUPPORT

chances of dying within 6 months only

uretomeetthecriteriawouldcarryvery
little prognostic significance (negative
LRs between 0.87 and 0.99).
Anothermethodofassessingthevalue
of a test across all possible cutoff points
is the area under an ROC curve. The
ROC area serves as a measure of diag-
nostic accuracy, specifically rank-
order discrimination of a test. The pos-
sible values for this measure range from
0.5 to 1; the closer the area under the
ROC curve is to 1, the more discrimi-
nating the test. For the NHO guidelineÂ­
basedcombinationcriteria,theROCarea
was 0.54 Â± 0.01, in which 0.5 would in-
dicate a completely valueless test. The
test achieved only 8% of the potentially
available rank-order discrimination and
can be seen, therefore, to be an ex-
tremely poor discriminator.
FIGURE 2 illustrates schematically the
limited accuracy of the broad, interme-
diate, and narrow inclusion criteria in
identifying patients with a prognosis of
6 months or less. The most restrictive
criteriaexcludedalmostallpatientswho
survived longer than 6 months (false-
positive rate, 5.1%) but also excluded
almost all patients in the target group
(false-negative rate, 99%). The least re-
strictive criteria identified a group of pa-
tients whose risk of 6-month mortal-
ity was only slightly higher than that
of the remaining SUPPORT patients,
while still excluding most patients who
were actually near death.
COMMENT
The prognostic criteria we used to simu-
late NHO guidelines were largely inef-
fective in predicting which seriously ill
hospitalized patients with COPD, CHF,
or ESLD have a prognosis of 6 months
or less. Among patients meeting vari-
ous combinations of criteria, 6-month
survival ranged from 53% to 70%.
Despite their limited ability to pre-
dict 6-month survival, all criteria
reduced the eligible population dra-
matically.Eventhemostinclusivecom-
bination of criteria eliminated 65% of
SUPPORT patients with advanced
chronic disease, including 58% of
patients who actually died within 6
months of discharge. The most restric-
tive combination eliminated 99% of
patients who died within 6 months.
Thus,thecombinationcriteriaweana-
lyzedallsucceededinexcludingmostpa-
tients who lived longer than 6 months,
but in doing so they also excluded the
vast majority of the target group they
weresupposedtoidentify--patientswho
were dead in 6 months or less. And even
though patients meeting various crite-
ria were somewhat more likely to die
sooner, invariably a large proportion
(53%) lived longer than 6 months.
Does this imply that suggested clini-
cal guidelines for determining progno-
sis in noncancer diseases are seriously
flawed?Notnecessarily.Themorelikely
implication of this study is that the goal
of determining in advance--with a high
degree of accuracy--which individual
patients with COPD, CHF, or ESLD will
die within 6 months is unrealistic.
This analysis further suggests that if
a high degree of predictive accuracy is
demanded by those who interpret the
6-monthprognosticrequirementforhos-
pice enrollment, few patients who die of
thesetypesofchronicdiseaseswillbeeli-
gibleforhospicecare.Settingthethresh-
old high (eg, stipulating that only 20%
of patients should outlive their 6-month
prognosis) would eliminate hospice ac-
cess for these patients almost entirely.
None of the criteria tested in this study
succeeded in identifying a population of
patients who met this stringent stan-
dard--notevenbyeliminatingmorethan
99% of seriously ill patients.

But while cancer patients are often in

Putanotherway,thesickestpatientsare

This randomness factor in death due
to chronic disease also explains why the

tion included in the study,29 failed to

identify a sizable population of COPD,
CHF, or ESLD patients who died within
6 months. Even among the small sub-
set of patients with the worst prognosis
(only 1% had an estimated prognosis of
10% at 6 months), 41% survived more
than 6 months.
Of all the groups examined in the
study, the 55 patients discharged di-
rectly to hospice care had the shortest
median survival (24 days), as well as the
smallest chance of surviving more than
6 months (21%). One possible expla-
nation for this finding is that clini-
cians were able to identify patients with
worse prognoses based on factors other
than those analyzed in this study. An-
other possibility is that patients re-
ferred to hospice care are less likely to
receive life-prolonging treatment and
therefore die sooner. The current study
does not attempt to differentiate be-
tween these 2 alternatives.
Another limitation of this analysis is
that we were not able to precisely simu-
late all components of the NHO crite-
ria. For example, the NHO guidelines
rely heavily on changes over time, a di-
mension that is not well captured in the
SUPPORT data. Although it is unques-
tionably possible that death within 6
months could be more accurately pre-
dicted through further refinement of
these criteria, it seems implausible that
accuracy for individual patients would
improveenoughtoalterthecentralfind-
ings of this study.
It is also important to note that
SUPPORT was a study of hospitalized
patients and may not be generalizable
to broader populations of patients with
advanced chronic disease.31 For in-
stance, seriously ill patients who seek
aggressive hospital care may be less
likely to choose hospice for their fu-
ture care. Also, the SUPPORT popula-
tion was younger than the national av-
erage for dying, and younger age has
been shown to correlate with the use
of more aggressive care.32,33
This analysis presents a prelimi-
nary effort to test prognostic criteria for
hospiceenrollmentamongpatientswith
advanced lung, heart, or liver disease
using existing data. A prospective study
is required to understand the effects of
these criteria in actual clinical prac-
tice. However, such a prospective study
should assure that the overall popula-
tion of persons dying due to chronic dis-
eases is assessed, and not just those now
referred for hospice enrollment. Study-
ing only those referred could be help-
ful in addressing the question of
whether a small population with dire
short-term prognoses can be identi-
fied but would not address the ques-
tion of how to meet the needs of the
much larger population of patients who
are dying of advanced chronic disease
but who do not meet current eligibil-
ity criteria for hospice care.
