Introduction
Importance of news media in our daily life is being intensi-
fied. The audiences are not only satisfied with what they get
instantly from the media, but they also want to know detailed
aspects of public issues or affairs. Perhaps more than ever
before, media and communication are the center of our every-
day lives. Sometimes on our own and sometimes in the com-
pany of others, media entertain us, enable connections with
friends and communities, provide interpretations of the world
around us, and offer resources for the forging of identities and
imaginations (Hodkinson, 2011). In the contemporary world,
role of media is not only limited to serve the individual but
also a given society in both the national and international
arena with interpretation, observations, and suggestions on
different issues and affairs. Media influence our choices, per-
ceptions, and decisions about viewing a matter or an affair
related to personal, group, and public interests.
It is needless to say that the political leaders and the gov-
ernments throughout the world rely on the media for making
decisions on the issues of greater public interest. Media facil-
itate molding public opinion on significant issues by present-
ing information and analysis. Media content, particularly the
editorial articles of the newspapers, play a vital role in form-
ing national as well as regional harmony. Editorials of the
newspapers represent the view of the newspapers themselves
on a given issue. The newspapers demonstrate their stance on
the issues of public interest through arguments, interpreta-
tion, and suggestions. Thus, the policy makers are facilitated
to formulate policies reflecting public perception, choices,
and demands.
On June 6, 2015, Prime Ministers of Bangladesh and
India drew a final shape toward implementation of the long-
standing Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) for resolving 68
year's border disputes between the countries. Prior to
exchanging the final documents regarding the issue, India
ratified LBAin the Parliament during early May 2015. Under
the agreement, India handed over 111 enclaves encompass-
ing 17,160 acres of land to Bangladesh and received 51

Editorial Coverage on Implementation
of Bangladesh­India Land Boundary
Agreement: An Analysis of Six Dailies of
Bangladesh and India
Muhammed Rashedul Hasan1
and Sheikh Mohammad Shafiul Islam1
Abstract
Newspapers influence the formation, shaping, and molding public opinion by generating debate on various issues of public
interest. The "editorials" represent the voice of a daily on an issue, imply stance of the authority, and influence public
opinion. The Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) of 1974 between Bangladesh and India is an issue of interests for the people
of both the countries as well as the global policy makers. The newspapers of both the countries have shown their concerns
through analyses, comments, and observations on the same. The present study aims at understanding the stance of the
newspapers of both the countries with regard to the much-talked about LBA issue by analyzing contents and discourse of
the relevant editorials of six leading dailies of both the countries. It reveals that the dailies have expressed their concerns for
peaceful implementation of the LBA as well as stressed on maintaining bilateral relationship and economic progress between
Bangladesh and India. Simultaneously, tone of the editorials was critical of the role of the governments and the policy makers
of both the countries besides criticizing both the domestic and international political dynamics.

enclaves comprising 7,110 acres from Bangladesh on July
31, 2015. The enclaves, geographically scattered from the
main land, inhibit about 51,000 people. Implementation of
LBA has created hope among the enclave dwellers of a better
life being citizens of an independent country--Bangladesh
or India. These people are now expecting of enjoying their
identity through citizenship and availing fundamental rights.
Experts consider this historic initiative as a milestone in
developing bilateral cooperation and ensuring regional secu-
rity. The newspapers of both Bangladesh and India have cov-
ered the ratification and implementation procedure of LBA
significantly. The present study aims at figuring out the
dynamics of editorial coverage of the leading dailies pub-
lished from Bangladesh and India.
The LBA: An Overview
After partition of India in 1947, the Radcliffe Line became the
border between India and East Pakistan, and following the lib-
eration of Bangladesh in 1971, the same line became the bor-
der between the two countries. Although the demarcation of
the border between India and the then Pakistan had started
soon after the partition, it was not successfully carried out due
to slower progress in determining the passages of the border
accurately. Later, Nehru­Noon Agreement of 1958 raised
some hope of demarking the border, but it was stopped by sub-
sequent hostilities and mistrusts between India and Pakistan.
The problem continued even after creation of independent
Bangladesh. Bangladesh and India were able to conclude the
LBA in 1974 with a view of resolving the complex border
demarcation. The agreement being not ratified by India for
decades has allowed to partial implementation of the same, for
example, both the countries share an approximately 4,096.7
km long land boundary. Relating to Dahagram andAngarporta
enclaves of Bangladesh, Article 1(14) of the 1974 LBA pro-
vides for access to these enclaves by leasing in perpetuity an
area of 178 × 85 m2 near Tin Bigha. This was implemented
through Letters of Exchange on October 7, 1982, between the
then Foreign Minister of India and the then Foreign Minister
of Bangladesh and on March 26, 1992, between the Foreign
Secretary of India and the Additional Foreign Secretary of
Bangladesh. Three major issues concerning (a) undemarcated
land boundary of approximately 6.1 km in three sectors,
namely, Daikhata-56 (West Bengal), Muhuri river--Belonia
(Tripura), and Lathitila--Dumabari (Assam); (b) exchange of
enclaves; and (c) adverse possessions were unsettled (Ministry
of External Affairs, Government of India, n.d.).
During the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of
Bangladesh to India in January 2010, India and Bangladesh
expressed the desire to reach a final resolution to the long-
standing issue and agreed to address all outstanding bound-
ary issues in accordance with the LBAof 1974. Subsequently,
detailed negotiations, joint visits to the concerned areas, and
land surveys were conducted, resulting in the Protocol con-
cluded in September 2011. In finalizing the 2011 Protocol,
the situation on the ground and wishes of the people residing
in the areas involved were taken into account and the written
consent of the concerned State Governments of India was
obtained (Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India,
n.d.).
Again, the protocol has not been implemented due to
changing political scenario of the countries. Finally, as a
result of successful diplomatic initiatives, the Parliament of
India ratified the LBA through amending the constitution in
May 2015. Documents related to LBAratification and imple-
mentation were exchanged between the countries during the
visit of Indian Premier to Dhaka in June 2015. Following the
exchange of documents, both the countries agreed on prin-
ciple to exchange the enclaves from July 31, 2015. To facili-
tate exchange of the enclaves, representatives of both the
countries have surveyed the dwellers to determine their
choice of citizenship.
Due to pending LBA issues for decades, the enclave
dwellers had to undergo countless miseries. They were not
entitled to receive public services of any country without
citizenship. They had no educational institutions, hospitals,
power supply, and other necessary social infrastructures to
address their fundamental needs. Nongovernmental organi-
zations (NGOs) were barred from working in the enclaves
for improving life and livelihood status of the poor dwellers.
It is easily guessed by the lifestyles and mysteries associated
with the enclave inhabitants from a report of The Economist
in 2011:
A few years ago, away from Cooch Behar, on the eastern border
with India, I met a man who lived smack on the border between
Tripura state and Bangladesh. His living room was in Bangladesh,
his toilet in India. He had been a local politician in India, and was
now working as a farmer in Bangladesh. As is typical in such
places, he sent his daughters to school in Bangladesh, and his
sons to India, where schools, he thought, were much better. To
his mind, the fence dividing the two countries was of little value.
But, he conceded, "at least my cows don't run away anymore."

Roadmap to Implementation of LBA
Issue
Bangladesh­India relationship roots in the liberation war of
Bangladesh. India's contribution to the emergence of
Bangladesh as an independent nation has become one of the
major indicators of developing, restoring, and advancing the
mutual relationship between the countries. Historical under-
standing between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi
had led to reach an agreement of settling the unsettled land
boundary between four states of India and Bangladesh in
May 1974.
Bangladesh ratified the agreement in 1974 while India
held back the process with an excuse of constitutional
amendment to implement the same. Despite frequent assur-
ances by Delhi, the process of implementation of the
Hasan and Islam 3
agreement was deterred by court cases against the LBA,
opposition from state governments and power politics in
Delhi. Delhi, it appears, was never serious to resolve the dis-
pute. The so-called "illegal immigration," "security," and
"economic" issues seem to have motivated Delhi to conclude
the LBA (Hasan, 2015).
In January 2010, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited
India when the Congress-led the United Progressive Alliance
(UPA) made a promise to resolve at least two outstanding
issues--the LBA and the Teesta Water-Sharing Treaty. Later,
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Dhaka in
September 2011 when the Protocol related to the LBA was
signed, but the UPA had no strength enough in the Lok Sabha
to make the bill regarding this passed. The Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP), then in opposition, stiffly opposed the move
which aired of the initiative taken by both the Prime
Ministers. In 2014, BJP-led the National DemocraticAlliance
came to the power with two thirds majority and Narendra
Modi took the charge of the premier of the country. Majority
did not add strength for the Modi government for passing the
LBA Bill in the Parliament in the face of opposite stand by
the BJP leaders in Assam, one of the four states involved
with the Agreement. At that point, Delhi thought of passing
the bill excluding Assam. The Congress-led Assam govern-
ment, however, strongly opposed BJP's move to exclude the
state from the process of settlement. Congress, the main
opposition party in the Lok Sabha, also put its foot down and
warned that it would oppose Assam's exclusion. After bick-
ering for weeks, a compromise was achieved between the
BJP and Congress, and finally the Bill went through unop-
posed in both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.
What Is Editorial Coverage?
In the print media, specifically in the daily newspapers, an
editorial coverage is a write-up which depicts views and
stances of a newspaper on particular contemporary issues
that usually include socioeconomic, cultural, political, envi-
ronmental, and other subjects having significance to a larger
section of the people. In a newspaper, an editorial is gener-
ally written by the editor or assistant editors or the persons
assigned to do the same on behalf of the editor. The editorial
writer selects a current issue having public interests, conse-
quence, and significance; gathers relevant information on the
same; finds correlation among different facts; and synthe-
sizes, interprets, and analyzes different aspects. The main
purpose of an editorial is to raise public voice for finding out
solution to a particular social problem.According to F. Fraser
Bond, newspaper reserves only one page and sometimes
only one column to voice its own ideas, its own thoughts, and
its own opinions. Bond (1955) wrote, "Ideally the function of
the editorial is to inform and lead public opinion. It interprets
the current news to the readers and points out its significance
(p. 194)." Editorials give opinions on important social, polit-
ical, economic, or legal issues of the day and intend to
persuade readers to agree to a particular point of view
(Sarker, 2012). In editorial, policy of a newspaper is reflected
(Khandoker, 2014). Editorial means drawing a decision on
an important issue within a limited, narrowed, and specific
scope (Salam, 2001).
Objectives of the Study
The overall objective of the study is to comprehend dynam-
ics of editorial stances of the selected dailies regarding the
issue of LBA while the specific objectives include to
·
· comprehend the hidden meaning of the editorial
write-ups;
·
· figure out tone of the dailies, that is, whether the tone
was favoring or disfavoring LBA implementation;
·
· comprehend depth of analysis of the issues;
·
· explore relationship between editorial coverage and
perceived political affiliation or ideologies of the dai-
lies; and
·
· understand the role of the editorial articles in shaping
public discourse on the issue.
Major Research Questions
The principal questions of the study included the following:
Research Question 1: In what way did the selected dai-
lies show their stance on the LBA issue?
Research Question 2: Did they support or oppose the
process of reaching consensus regarding LBA?
Research Question 3: Did the dailies view the matter
neutrally, going beyond the national interest or supporting
for a greater bilateral relationship?
Research Question 4: How did they present the editorial
content? What was the tone of the presentation?
Research Question 5: How did the dailies put emphasis
on the political affiliation or ideology in analyzing and
interpreting the issue?
Theoretical Framework of the Study
The study mainly bases on two influential schools of thoughts
in the domain of media and communication studies: social
responsibility theory of the press, and agenda setting and
framing functions of media. The social responsibility theory
of the press emphasizes on the need for an independent press
that scrutinizes different social institutions and provides
objective and accurate news reports as well as impartial
interpretation of various phenomena. Social responsibility
theory challenged media professionals' ingenuity to develop
new ways of serving their communities. It encouraged them
to see themselves as frontline participants in the battle to pre-
serve democracy in a world drifting inexorably toward totali-
tarianism. By helping pluralistic groups, media were building
4 SAGE Open
a wall to protect democracy from external and internal foes
(Baran & Davis, 2012). Denis McQuail (1994) summarized
basic principles of social responsibility theory of which some
of the relevant aspects with the present study are as follows:
·
· Media should accept and fulfill certain obligations to
society.
·
· These obligations are mainly to be met by setting high
or professional standards of informativeness, truth,
accuracy, objectivity, and balance.
·
· In accepting and applying these obligations, media
should be self-regulating within the framework of law
and established institutions.
·
· The media as a whole should be pluralist and reflect
the diversity of their society, giving access to various
points of view and to rights of reply.
Agenda-setting is the process whereby the news media
lead the public in assigning relative importance to various
public issues (Zhu & Blood, 1997). The core idea is that the
news media indicate to the public what the main issues of the
day are and this is reflected in what the public perceives as
the main issues (McQuail, 2005). The media agenda influ-
ences the public agenda not by saying "this issue is impor-
tant" in an overt way but by giving more space and time to
that issue and by giving it more prominent space and time
(Miller, 2002).
In the lights of these two perspectives, it has been searched
out how the editorials of the selected newspapers of
Bangladesh and India have considered and interpreted the
LBA issue and how significantly they have undertaken the
issue for analysis and presentation.
Method of the Study
The study has been conducted applying the combination of
content analysis and discourse analysis method. Content
analysis is a specific research approach used frequently in all
the areas of the media studies. This method is popular with
mass media researchers because it is an efficient way to
investigate the content of the media. Walizer and Wienir
(1978) defined it as any systematic procedure devised to
examine the content of recorded information, whereas
Krippendorff (2004) defined it as a research technique for
making replicable and valid references from data to their
context. Kerlinger's (2000) definition is fairly typical:
"Content analysis is a method of studying and analyzing
communication in a systematic, objective, and quantitative
manner for the purpose of measuring variables (p. 144)."
Riffe and Freitag (1997) found that about 25% of the
1,977 full-length research articles published in Journalism
and Mass Communication Quarterly from 1971 to 1995
were content analyses. Kamhawi and Weaver (2003) revealed
that content analysis was the most popular data-gathering
method reported in major mass communication journals
between 1995 and 1999. An informal content analysis of
three journals that focus on mass communication research
(Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Journalism
and Mass Communication Quarterly, and Mass
Communication and Society) from 2007 to 2008 found that
content analysis was still a popular method, used in about
one third of all published articles (Wimmer & Dominick,
2011).
Discourse analysis is a methodology for analyzing social
phenomena that are qualitative, interpretative, and construc-
tionist. It explores how the socially constructed ideas and
objects are created and used in the media content. Discourse
analysis focuses on media text and tries to explain how the
text constructs the social reality. It deals with tools and tech-
niques of the media used for emphasizing and de-emphasiz-
ing an issue, an individual, or a group by using metaphors,
words, imposing images, and so on (Islam & Kabir, 2015).
Both of the methodologies were applied to obtain in-depth
findings according to their relevance while investigating
such research issue.
Selection of the Sample Dailies
Six dailies--three from each of the countries, Bangladesh
and India--were selected for the study. The dailies selected
from Bangladesh include the Prothom Alo, the Naya Diganta,
and the New Age, whereas the selected dailies from India are
the Times of India, the Hindu, and the Anandabazar Patrika.
These dailies have been selected based on their circulation,
availability, and perceived ideological bias.
The selected dailies in brief.The Prothom Alo is one of the
leading vernacular national dailies in Bangladesh owned by
one of the country's major business companies "Transcom
Limited." The political affiliation of the owner is not clear;
however, the editor of the daily was leaning toward the leftist
ideology previously. The Naya Diganta is one of the major
vernacular national dailies too in the country which is owned
by an influential leader of Bangladesh Jammat-e-Islami, one
of the dominant allies of Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP). The daily is perceived commonly having pro-Islamic
attitude and rightist ideology. Tone of the daily is strongly
critical toward the ruling party Bangladesh Awami League
and the government activities. The New Age is one of the
major English-language dailies published from Dhaka, Ban-
gladesh, of which the editor is perceived leaning toward the
leftist ideology and critical to the ruling party Bangladesh
Awami League and the government.
The Anandabazar Patrika is a Bengali-language newspa-
per published from Kolkata, New Delhi, and Mumbai, India
by Ananda Bazar Patrika Group. According to the "Audit
Bureau of Circulations," India, the daily has a circulation of
1.16 million copies as of December 2013. According to the
Indian Readership Survey (IRS) 2012, it is the only major
Bengali newspaper in India and has an average issue
Hasan and Islam 5
readership of 5.8 million. Presently, the newspaper is edited
by Aveek Sarkar (Anandabazar Patrika, n.d.). It is perceived
that the daily demonstrates an antileftist political ideology
leaning toward the rightist part of the Congress.
The Times of India is an Indian English-language daily
newspaper. It is the third largest newspaper in India by circu-
lation and largest selling English-language daily in the world
according to Audit Bureau of Circulations (India). According
to IRS 2012, the Times of India is the most widely read
English newspaper in India with a readership of 7.643 mil-
lion. This ranks the Times of India as the top English daily in
India by readership. It is owned and published by Bennett
Coleman & Co. Ltd., which is owned by the Sahu Jain family
(The Times of India, n.d.).
The daily was sometimes perceived showing bias toward
the UPA government; however, it also supported Anna
Hazare campaign against the Congress-led government
(Thakur, 2013). The daily Hindu, being another leading
English-language daily of India, headquartered in Chennai.
It is the second most circulated English-language newspaper
in India with an average qualifying sale of 1.39 million cop-
ies (as of December 2013). According to IRS 2012, it was the
third most widely read English newspaper in India (after the
Times of India and Hindustan Times), with a readership of
2.2 million people. The Hindu has its largest base of circula-
tion in southern India, and is the most widely read English
daily newspaper in Kerala and Tamil Nadu (The Hindu, n.d.).
The daily is perceived sympathetic toward the leftist political
ideology supporting the Communist Party of India (Marxist)
(Thakur, 2013).
Selection of the Editorials
After a long pause, the LBAissue became a media buzzing in
May 2015 when the agreement was being tabled in the Indian
Parliament for ratification. The issue came to a bilateral set-
tlement through the visit of Indian Prime Minister in Dhaka
during early June of 2015. Considering this timeline, the edi-
torial articles published during May 1 to June 15, 2015, came
under the study. During the period, the selected dailies had
published 21 editorials. Of the editorials, nine were pub-
lished in the dailies selected from India while the remaining
ones were from Bangladesh. Table 1 shows the titles of the
editorials that underwent analysis:
Findings of the Study
The Prothom Alo
Editorial tone of the daily was critical to both of the govern-
ments--India and Bangladesh--as well as the policy makers
for pending the issue. Dilly-dally of the Indian government
and policy makers have been criticized boldly for not step-
ping forward to implement the LBA. The daily criticized
India for not implementing the protocol signed during the
visit of Manmohan Singh in 2011. Exclusion of Assam at the
initial phase of tabling the amendment bill of LBA imple-
mentation by the Modi government has been critically
viewed by the daily.
The editorial article titled, "Dual Role of New Delhi--No
Chance to Reform the Land BoundaryAgreement" published
on May 4, 2015, criticized the initiative of putting forward
the approval of the amendment bill by the Modi government
in the face of opposition of the Assam BJP and termed the
process as unacceptable. The tone of the article went for an
inclusive solution to the issue. Similarly, the article viewed
the role of the Bangladesh government in this regard as
"ambiguous and weak." In the article, it was questioned,
"Which one is more important for the government--Modi's
visit or implementation of the agreement?"
Silence of Bangladesh Government regarding putting for-
ward the issue has been also criticized in the editorial cover-
age. The editorial article titled, "Land Boundary Agreement
Ratification--Congratulations to the Indian Leaders," pub-
lished on May 9, 2015, highly acknowledged the contribu-
tion of the Indian Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition,
and the Chief Ministers of the provinces concerning to the
enclaves. Special thanks were paid to the Chief Minister of
Assam. The article also implied on the sensible resolution of
the pending Teesta water sharing deal. Apart from effective
implementation of LBA, the daily has stressed on the reha-
bilitation of the inhabitants of the geographically scattered
enclaves who were deprived of the citizen rights for 68 years.
The Naya Diganta
The editorial tone of the daily was strongly critical toward
India's policy. The daily boldly criticized initial step of the
Modi government for tabling the amendment bill of LBA
excluding Assam in the face of Assam BJP's claim of losing
land due to the implementation procedure. However, oppos-
ing the BJP's statement, Assam's Chief Minister outlined the
real scenario of land distribution where it was depicted that
the claim of BJP regarding losing of land was not true. Modi
government did not pay heed to Assam BJP's statement
rather relied on the Chief Minister's speech and included
Assam in the process of LBA implementation through the
parliamentary process of voting on the bill regarding the
issue. The editorial published on May 11, 2015, explains that
India always remains sincere to its own interests. The daily
calls India to move from its one-sided stance regarding set-
tlement of the bilateral issue. The editorial indicates Farakka
issue too.
On May 13, 2015, the daily published an editorial where
apprehension of losing sovereignty of "Tin Bigha Corridor"
was felt due to continuous surveillance of Border Security
Force (BSF) on the passage of the Bangladeshis though the
corridor is leased to Bangladesh for 99 years. The editorial
article titled, "Exclusion of Assam From LBA--Strategy for
Enduring Is Not Desired," published on May 6, 2015,
6 SAGE Open
emphasized that India should shun the intention of one-sided
benefit and authoritative attitude in the interest of maintain-
ing good relationship with Bangladesh. The article men-
tioned, "Unfortunately, Bangladesh is being often deprived
of having rational and sympathetic attitude from India." The
daily, in this article, expressed its concern of security for the
critics of Indian policies in Bangladesh.
In an editorial published on May 29, 2015, the daily indi-
cated that the ruling Awami League has a big agenda to
maintain good relation with Modi government for its whole-
hearted support to sustain in the power. Apart from these, the
daily poured efforts to link between the speeches of some
influential leaders of Awami League and apprehension of
losing sovereignty of Bangladesh. The tone of the editorial
implicated that two countries (Bangladesh and India) were
turning together into one state.
The New Age
The daily was thoroughly found critical toward the stance of
both the governments--Bangladesh and India--regarding
delayed ratification of the long-pending LBA by the Indian
Parliament. In an editorial titled, "LBA Ratification by India,
Congress Fixation of Bangladeshi Ruling Elite," the daily
criticized the ruling party of Bangladesh, Awami League for
its perceived dependence and preference to Congress for set-
tling the LBA issue with India. At the same time, the daily
toned that the BJP government promised more than the
Congress to Bangladesh regarding settling bilateral disputes
and preserving mutual relationship that developed around
India's support to the liberation war of Bangladesh. The daily
suggested Awami League to keep pace with the reality rather
than being obsessed to the political party, the Indian National
Congress.
The daily voiced to establish linkage with the Awami
League's initiatives of LBA implementation and other bipar-
tite relationship with India as a means of gaining support
from the country to "cling to power." The daily criticized the
effort of BNP to gain support from India with a hope for its
return to state power. The daily was critical toward the bor-
der killing by the BSF of India and India's position regarding
water sharing of the River Teesta. The daily rated Modi's
visit to Bangladesh as an insignificant event for the country.
The Anandabazar Patrika
The overall stance of the daily was in favor of the LBA issue
though it has poured efforts to give a satirical analysis in
some of its content. The tone of satire was mostly limited to
Mamata and Modi's political game and attitude. The daily

elaborated how Modi managed Mamata to stand by his side
during his visit to Bangladesh apart from emphasizing on
political differences between the Chief Minister of West
Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. The daily implicated
the failure of Manmohan Singh in managing Mamata on the
issue. The editorial tone of the daily emphasized on coopera-
tion, coordination, and mutual understanding between the
states and the central government of India. Dynamics of
Assam issue in the process of LBA settlement amid ideologi-
cal differences among political parties also got importance in
the editorial coverage. The daily presented political analysis
regarding differences and amity between Modi and Assam
BJP. Political "gain­loss" has been also stressed over inclu-
sion of Assam in the process of LBA settlement between
India and Bangladesh.
The editorial article titled, "Unusual," published on May
9, 2015, said,
To what extent the votes of BJP will decline in Assam due to the
agreement with Bangladesh is not clear at all, if it declines, it
will be a minimal loss. The ratification and implementation of
the LBA will not only lessen the sufferings of the enclave
dwellers but also pave the way of resolving a long pending issue
and reinforce bilateral relationship with Bangladesh.
One of the mentionable aspects of the editorial coverage
of the daily was to give credit to Modi government for his
political gain over inclusion of Assam in the ratification pro-
cess. As a result of such inclusion, Modi was able to manage
the main opposition Congress's support in the Parliament
which was highly appreciated by the daily. Modi's political
stance, leadership, decisions, and determination were ana-
lyzed as positive and effective in the process of LBA
ratification.
The Times of India
The daily thoroughly favored the process of LBA ratification.
The daily urged the Modi government to implement the LBA
without any delay and excuse. The editorials of the daily
showed a great concern for boosting up regional development
and mutual relationship through proper implementation of the
LBA. The daily in its one editorial write-up stated, "Needless
to say, operationalising LBA will give a tremendous boost to
India-Bangladesh relations. With ratification of the agree-
ment, the goodwill generated should propel both sides to set-
tle other outstanding issues such as Teesta river water sharing
and transit rights." The daily wrote "must stop playing poli-
tics and ratify LBA without any exclusion" aiming at the
Modi government. On May 8, an editorial titled, "Border
Breakthrough: Ratification of LBA Paves the Way for
Enhanced India­Bangladesh Ties and Regional Growth," was
written of which the tone of the words has expressed strong
urge for LBA ratification and implementation. The daily also
stressed on full ratification of the LBA as envisaged by New
Delhi and Dhaka in their 2011 agreement. In one of its edito-
rials published on June 8, 2015, the daily rated Modi's visit to
Dhaka as very successful one which "raises hopes of subcon-
tinent's Berlin wall coming down."
The Hindu
The daily termed the LBA issue as a "Political Game"
between the countries, political parties, and leaders. The tone
of the editorial of the daily was also in favor of resolving the
enclave issue that triggered from lack of consensus regarding
LBA settlement between India and Bangladesh. The daily in
its editorial viewed the enclave issue as an uncertainty and
misery for 51,000 people of both the countries. The Hindu
advocated for the inclusion of Assam in the process of LBA
settlement. The daily, however, pinched Modi government
and tried to link the LBA issue with the provincial politics
and election. The editorials of the daily strongly criticized
India's delay in terms of taking on positive measures in
regard to find a solution to the issue. The daily recognized
the issue as a matter of India's credibility to Bangladesh too
and stressed on promotion of friendly relationship with the
neighborhood through peaceful resolution of the same.
The editorial article titled, "Local Politics in Foreign
Policy," published on May 5, 2015, clearly implies that the
Government of India should have minimized the "lapse of
communication" with Bangladesh regarding the revised plan
of the amendment bill regarding the LBA ratification. In the
same article, the delays of India at different stages were
marked and said, "Each of these delays don't just put off an
agreement to resolve a crucial issue between India and
Bangladesh, they chip away at India's credibility in the
neighbourhood."
Analysis of Findings
Both Naya Diganta and the New Age were found expressing
the views almost in similar manner. Editorial tone of both the
dailies was critical toward both the government of India and
Bangladesh. The Naya Diganta endeavored to establish a
relationship of the rulingAwami League with the Government
of India, especially with Modi's administration for availing
support to remain in the state power. On the contrary, the
daily tried to represent the government and policy makers of
India concentrating on their own interests rather than consid-
ering bilateral relationship with Bangladesh. The New Age,
conversely, put more emphasis on the role of the Indian gov-
ernment for not resolving the lengthy LBAissue. The editori-
als were found critical to point out India's responsibilities for
pending the issue for decades. The editorials of the Prothom
Alo have concentrated on event and issue-based develop-
ment of the LBA ratification and implementation process.
The daily was critical toward both the government of India
and Bangladesh in regard to resolving the bilateral issue.
However, pro-Bangladesh and pro-people attitude of the
8 SAGE Open
editorial contents were reflected while the tone of criticizing
India's role was predominant.
The Times of India was found possessing an attitude
toward the betterment of the people of both the countries
rather than the political and diplomatic gain over LBA issue.
The editorial focus of the daily laid on bilateral relation,
regional economic growth, peaceful coexistence, and mutual
understanding between the countries. The daily advocated
for maintaining a friendly relationship based on mutual trust
and benefits through settling down the issue. The daily, even
being published from India, has boldly criticized Indian poli-
cies and the political dilemma surrounding ratification and
implementation of the LBA as well as urged the Indian gov-
ernment to quicken the process of resolving the prolonged
enclave crisis.
The Hindu has expressed almost similar type of notion
showed by the Times of India. Editorial tone of the daily in
analyzing the facts concerning the LBA and enclave issues
can be rated as liberal. The daily, like the Times of India,
showed its stance toward maintaining a bilateral relationship
through peaceful and quick settlement of the long-drawn-out
LBA issue in the interest of the regional development. The
daily seemed critical to the delay of India's policy makers in
resolving the issue. Satire.
Apart from the above two dailies, the Anandabazar
Patrika, was somewhat different in viewing the issue and
showing its standpoint. Tone of the editorial coverage of the
daily seemed light and satirical. The editorial write-ups were
found paying more attention on the interpretation of the
political dynamics and relation between the political parties
of India rather than pouring deep concentration on the LBA
issue itself. Debates over the power, politics, and influence
structures between the central and provincial government
and the political parties of India were emphasized in the edi-
torials. However, the daily's bias toward steering on mutual
relationship and interest between Bangladesh and India was
visible.
Conclusion
The editorial stance of the dailies can be rated upholding
both the national and bipartite interests on the whole.
Presentation and analysis of the facts in the editorials were
linked with the political and ideological affiliation of the
owners and the editors of the dailies. For example, the Naya
Diganta, perceived as the rightist daily having direct politi-
cal and ideological affiliation with Bangladesh Jammat-e-
Islami, critically portrayed the issue emphasizing the
government's reported attachment with India for sustaining
into power. The editorials of the Prothom Alo were written
with moderate balancing between facts and public interest.
The daily tried to analyze the situations around the LBA
issue considering the political dynamics of both the countries
rather than blaming any government blindly. On the contrary,
the New Age perceived as one of the dailies having leftist
ideology was more critical to India's role in settling down the
issue. The Indian dailies were found expressing different
tones too. The Anandabazar Patrika was found more critical
to Mamata's administration while the Times of India and the
Hindu were critical toward the policies of the Government of
India. The aforesaid analyses facilitate to conclude that the
Indian dailies played more versatile role through liberal pre-
sentation of the content, neutralized analysis, and call for the
greater welfare of the people of both the countries.
