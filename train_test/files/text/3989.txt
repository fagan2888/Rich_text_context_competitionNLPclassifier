Introduction
For over a decade, professionals in the scientific community
have questioned why the large accumulation of basic scien-
tific research has been slow to "translate" into clinical appli-
cations (e.g., Chubb, 2012; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Ntzani,
& Ioannidis, 2003). Translational Research, through its mul-
tidisciplinary, collaborative approach, has emerged as a way
to speed up this process ultimately improving patient care.
As a result, some governments with advanced economies
have responded by implementing what could be described as
a translational research paradigm, a means of organizing
people and resources to achieve such an outcome.1 For
example, after much planning and negotiations, a pan-Euro-
pean consortium of 70 academic research centers of excel-
lence have been created for translational research projects
with their headquarters opened in 2013, Amsterdam
(EATRIS, 2014). In 2011, the United States expanded their
2006 translational research initiatives and opened the
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
(National Institutes of Health, 2014).
Collaboration is fundamental to the success of transla-
tional research, yet many professionals acknowledge there
are difficulties. For "collaborating with those outside the
walls of an institution may be more than culturally frowned
upon, it may even be illegal [e.g., patented processes]" and
"even within an institution . . . the subunits of the institution:
its departments, its divisions, its components produce col-
laboration `walls'of varying substantiality" (Bingham, 2011,
pp. xi-xii). In effect, even though translational researchers
realize collaboration is essential, there are problems in
achieving this goal. We propose that this might be better
addressed by investigating the group work that occurs in the
field, as collaboration is essentially about people working
jointly on a project.
Literature Review
There is a growing literature about translational researchers,
although group work requires more investigation. Studies
draw attention to how translational research incorporates an
array of professionals working together and across the nor-
mative or epistemic cultures of science and medicine (Lander
&Atkinson-Grosjean, 2011; Wainwright, Williams, Michael,
Farsides, & Cribb, 2006).2 For example, the sociological
research carried out by Wainwright et al. (2006) drew on the
experiences of basic scientists working on human stem cell
research for diabetes in a UK research facility.They described
how these basic scientists maintained a wider discourse of

Abstract
The collective lived experience of translational research teams requires further appreciation, particularly at the stages of
group formation. To achieve this, we conducted a case study of a translational research team (n = 16). Through the case
description and then discussing case-based themes with community of practice theory, themes such as "Being Open" and
"Working as a Group" found that this team's mutual respect, cooperation, and their sharing of knowledge uncovered an
alternative way that professionals organize themselves for translational research projects. In conjunction to this finding, our
analysis showed that the team has qualities of a community of practice.

the unlikelihood of collaboration between basic scientists
and those professionally trained in the medical sphere.
However, there were also discursive tactics being employed
within the institution and by the professionals themselves to
encourage collaboration for translational research.
In a recent study, Porter (2013) conducted research with
neuroscientists in a new UK translational research facility
that aimed to foster a culture of collaboration. Porter found
that collaboration was a means of increasing publication out-
puts as well as quickening the pace of the translational
research process. Yet, selecting people to collaborate with
was at times problematic given various inconsistencies in
behavior, such as a researcher wanting a colleague's research
results, but then not reciprocating. Porter also focused on
how the physical space and management's best intentions of
facilitating collaboration may not have the desired effect on
the professional staff.
Researchers have also noted and discussed the important
roles that clinician-scientists (or physician-scientists) have to
play in translational research (Lander & Atkinson-Grosjean,
2011; Wilson-Kovas & Hauskeller, 2012). Wilson-Kovas
and Hauskeller's (2012) research was one of the first to focus
on clinician-scientists and the role they play in the transla-
tional research process, bringing the knowledge of both basic
science and medicine, which is perceived to better facilitate
the process.
An interesting study by Lander and Atkinson-Grosjean
(2011) from an innovation system perspective theorized and
documented the hidden noncommercial organizational
arrangements between hospital and university institutions,
which facilitated a successful translational research process.
The research traced the development of a clinical application
from when a sick child was presented to a pediatric clinician-
scientist, and how professionals in both the hospital and uni-
versity laboratories worked together to create a diagnostic
test.
Morgan and colleagues (2011) conducted a pilot study
instigated by the United Kingdom's Medical Research
Council, where a Research Translator was employed to stim-
ulate a translational research culture between professionals
at a teaching and research hospital. Much of the study cen-
tered on how basic scientists and clinician-scientists
responded to the translational research change agent. The
study also provided details about the understandings of trans-
lational research by particular actors, namely, the Research
Translator, basic scientists, and clinician-scientists, along
with details about how a panel assessed the translatability of
research.
Social research has made inroads into understanding
translational research. However, few studies investigate the
interactions between professionals working in translational
research groups, particularly at the stage of their develop-
ment. For the most part, there is a technocratic mood to cur-
rent research, where there is a limited sustained description
on the collective lived experience of being in translational
research teams.
Research Aim and Question
A novel way of investigating the collective lived experience
of translational research teams is to return to thinking about
the importance of collaboration as tied to learning in prac-
tice. Collaboration, particularly when professionals identify
as coming from different professional cultures and/or disci-
plines, means that professionals need to learn in practice
from one another to achieve their common goals (cf. Oborn
& Dawson, 2011, on multidisciplinary health teams learning
to work together). This type of learning is not entirely an
apprenticeship of sorts (see Lave & Wenger, 1991) but a
mode of learning that happens within some type of "organi-
zational imagination"-- whether participants are fully cog-
nizant of this or not (Wenger, 1998, p. 257). Given that
translational research is only possible in highly sophisti-
cated and globally connected organizational spheres, the
type of learning being discussed here is the Wengerian con-
ception of "communities of practice." This is a social theory
of learning that is grounded in organizational life, even
though it may stretch beyond the immediate organizational
environment.
It has been found that in translational research work, "the
scientific and the clinical are embodied in different commu-
nities of practice with distinct cultures and practices" (Cribb,
Wainwright, Williams, Farsides, & Michael, 2008, p. 354),
which suggests that collaboration is a challenging process
between professionals located on different sides of this
divide. Yet, usage of the term communities of practice in
Cribb et al. (2008) is more akin to viewing different profes-
sional identities in translational research as belonging to
respective communities of practice. A similar idea can also
be found in Oborn and Dawson's (2011) work albeit about
professional identities in health care. We are now asking
whether a self-identified translational research team (com-
posed of people from both the scientific and medical spheres)
constitutes a community of practice within an organization
that intended to foster translational research. Our research
directive is enveloped within the overarching aim of describ-
ing the collective lived experience of being in a translational
research team in a specific organizational context.
We believe that such an approach is warranted as much
opinion and policy, along with social and organizational the-
ory deployed on translational researchers, is designed to
enhance organizational performance in terms of outputs,
which treats the humans who work in this field as a mere
(albeit important) resource. We borrow the critical manage-
ment studies seminal concept of "(non) performative intent"
as a means of counteracting "the intent to develop and cele-
brate knowledge which contributes to the production of max-
imum output for minimum input; it involves inscribing
knowledge with a means-ends calculation" (Fournier &
Grey, 2000, p. 17). For this research, there is interest in
describing the collaboration between the professionals and
presenting their voices--particularly at the group develop-
ment stage--to simply discover what can be found there.

Design
Theoretical Perspective and Method
An interpretive perspective was used in this research, as
there was a focus on describing the collective lived experi-
ences of the members of the team in their organizational con-
text. This was realized by way of an intrinsic case study
because "we are interested in it [the case], not because by
studying it we learn about other cases or about some general
problem, but because we need to learn about a particular
case" (Stake, 1995, p. 3).
First, we describe and contextualize the team members
and case study sample, within their organizational setting,
that is, the biomedical research team working in anAustralian
medical research institute. Such context is articulated through
a Case Description that is intended to state the "facts" in a
narrative-like manner (Creswell, 2007). Against this back-
ground, the Case-Based Themes (Creswell, 2007) are then
presented with a discussion on whether the group could be
considered a community of practice. Table 1 provides a sum-
mary of the case-based themes with their respective sub-
themes. The article ends with a final conclusion and
suggestions for further research.
Case Sample Selection
The main reason this research team was selected is that they
had only recently formed a group, so there was an opportu-
nity to research how they organized themselves. Another rea-
son in selecting this particular case was that translational
research was not yet a governmental priority in Australia at
the time. In 2009, the federal government issued Powering
Ideas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st Century. It outlines
the 10-year reform agenda for Australia's knowledge-based
industries to address "the country's long-term weakness in
business innovation, and in collaboration between research
and industry" (Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, p. 4).
There is no specific mention about translational research,
although collaboration is emphasized. In 2011, as this project
concluded, the government established the Therapeutic
Innovation Australia organization, designed in part to better
coordinate translational infrastructure and provide support to
translational researchers by integrating the academic, indus-
try, and public spheres (McKinnon, 2011).3 Our case then
provided us with an opportunity to view the emergence of a
translational research team within an organization without
the comparable government support found in other advanced
economies.
Method
Following university and hospital ethics approval, 16
researchers of an initially 22-member translational research
team (referred to in this article as The Team), agreed to share
their experiences of working together on a translational
research project.
Multiple methods of data collection were deployed by
the primary researcher (first author), including participant
observation between May and August 2009; document col-
lection, which related to The Team, such as their successful
funding application; and general documents broadly circu-
lated within the organization such a newsletters and emails.
Near the end of the participant observation phase, two focus
groups were also conducted with many questions themed by
the idea of collaboration. The first lasted an hour with six
participants and the second ran for 45 min with five partici-
pants. A list of data sets collected from the methods is pro-
vided in Table 2.

interpretation (Stake, 1995). The transcripts from the focus
groups were considered to be a significant data set of the
corpus, as there was much discussion on the group work of
The Team. The transcripts from the focus groups were
therefore subjected to further analysis that sought to iden-
tify salient case-based themes through the process of tem-
plate analysis (King, 2006). Confidentiality of participants
was ensured with interviewee talk de-identified from each
participant in the transcripts. The process of template anal-
ysis was conducted by the primary researcher and a co-
researcher (second author), who was also a participant in
the study. She was able to draw on her considerable practi-
tioner knowledge as a medical scientist (see Benington &
Hartley, 2006, on co-research methodology in organiza-
tions). This was balanced with wider input through a vali-
dation meeting held in February 2010, where five members
of The Team came together to assess whether the case-
based themes generated during data analysis reflected what
The Team had intended to convey (see Shenton, 2004, on
member checks for research credibility). Then, a full write-
up of the research by the primary researcher (first author),
using pseudonyms for each participant to ensure their ano-
nymity, was read by a clinician-scientist (third author) as
another participant check. He too was a participant in the
study and another co-researcher. Given his extensive expe-
rience in clinical medicine, along with medical, basic sci-
ence, and translational research, he was asked to provide
feedback on whether the primary researcher (first author)
was able to effectively describe the lived experience of
being in The Team within this specific organizational
context.
Case Description
Organizational Milieu
The Team was located within a biomedical research insti-
tute in Australia that, among other things, investigates the
causes and prevention of health conditions for humans,
including diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and stroke. As
the institute's promotional material explained, the organi-
zation is the "productive research arm" of a public teaching
hospital and aims to create a "dynamic environment in
which research and research training opportunities are
pursued."
In 2009, the research institute relocated its staff to a new
purposely built building and rebranded itself as a transla-
tional research facility, as this expression was believed to
capture the core work. Many researchers were aware of the
developments of translational research across the world and
sought to implement it within their projects and various
departments. However, not all researchers were convinced
that translational research was anything new, believing that
they and others in the scientific community had been carry-
ing out such collaborative work for years.4
Key Facts About the Research Team
It was within this organizational milieu that The Team started
work on their projects with funding for 3 years. However, the
catalyst for their interactions came in 2008 when a benevo-
lent foundation, with a strong history of supporting the
research institute, offered to fund projects that were designed
to encourage professionals from different research special-
ties and conventional research groupings to collaborate
within the new facility. The Team was formed with profes-
sionals from four established public teaching hospital depart-
ments that also have a presence in the research institute: the
Department of Otolaryngology/ENT (Ears, Nose, and
Throat), the Discipline of Medicine, the Rheumatology Unit
and the Neurology Unit.
During group formation, The Team believed it was impor-
tant to establish a "Memorandum of Understanding" between
its members. The document was intended to set up an ethical
collaboration, as some members felt they had not been
treated respectfully in previous research teams in which they
had worked.5 For example, some members believed their
contributions to previous projects were not recognized in
terms of authorship. Another member said they had been irri-
tated previously by certain researchers in the mind of "using
other people to just get what you want." This meant people
had contributed their knowledge and skills on a project with
little acknowledgment or compensation. Therefore, to mini-
mize the development of negative sentiments, The Team
wanted an amicable atmosphere characterized by profes-
sional interactions among respected peers. Hence, the
Memorandum of Understanding was seen as a way to pro-
mote ethical collaboration between the various individuals in
the group. Some of the points included in the Memorandum
of Understanding were as follows:
·
· The Team is greater than the sum of its parts.
·
· Each team member is a unique individual.
·
· The Team operates through a consensus framework.
·
· The direction of The Team is arrived at through dis-
cussion and dialogue.
This approach to working was established as a means of
creating a healthy collaborative environment to carry out
their research work.
The research direction of The Team was about under-
standing the mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation,
which seriously impacts on a person's quality of life.
Generally, inflammation is part of the body's healing pro-
cess, however, chronic inflammation is a "maladaptive
response that involves active inflammation, tissue destruc-
tion and attempts at tissue repair" that occurs for a prolonged
period of time (Weiss, 2008, p. 427). The Team was specifi-
cally focused on chronic inflammation caused by diseases
such as asthma, sinusitis, arthritis, and stroke. It was believed
that there were underlying features of chronic inflammation
Krawczyk et al. 5
present in all these diseases, which could be studied from
various angles.
As outlined in the funding application, The Team was to
conduct basic research, such as investigating "the molecular
and cellular mechanisms [i.e., processes] of inflammation
underlying chronic disease." This would then progress to
medical research, such as "developing pre-clinical [i.e., ani-
mal] models of inflammatory disease." The knowledge
gained from the basic and medical research would help
determine the types of clinical applications that would be
developed or applied through various experiments to observe
their effects on inflammation across the diseases.
The Team comprised seven Chief Investigators (4 female
and 3 male), who were the main drivers of the research on
chronic inflammation and were key contributors to the proj-
ect's development and direction. A further 15 personnel (4
female and 11 male) were to perform a variety of functions to
support the research work, thus The Team initially consisted
of 22 people. However, fewer people were involved because
some persons withdrew themselves from The Team once
their work started.
The Team included researchers who had been educated,
trained, and/or worked overseas in places such as Africa,
Asia, Europe and the United States. The Team comprised the
following people:
·
· Basic scientists--professionals who hold tertiary sci-
ence qualification(s) and often conduct basic research
throughout a wide range of scientific disciplines.
·
· Medical scientists--professionals who hold tertiary
science qualification(s) but work more on applied
research projects that are specific to medical research.
·
· Clinician-scientists--also known as physician-scien-
tists, with a tertiary qualification and professional reg-
istration to practice medicine, and also a postgraduate
science qualification.
·
· Clinicians--who hold a tertiary qualification and pro-
fessional registration to practice medicine, and may
have some additional training or experience in medi-
cal research.
·
· Postgraduate research students--who drew their pro-
fessional identity from their respective disciplinary
fields of basic science, medical science, and/or
medicine.
Due to their education or training, some of The Team
members identified with more than one professional identity.
For example, there was a clinician-scientist who worked in a
clinical capacity and also held a PhD with a basic research
orientation. Overall, the composition of The Team suggests
they are aligned to what Woolf (2008) describes as T-1 trans-
lational research, as the group was composed of those in the
scientific and medical spheres, along with their research
being mainly geared at utilizing basic and medical research
for the development of therapeutics.
There were several reasons why members of The Team
believed they needed to collaborate on this project, as out-
lined in a PowerPoint presentation they gave during a semi-
nar in 2009. Reasons included the "cross-fertilization . . . [of]
new research ideas" and the sharing of "new ideas and tech-
niques" that they brought to the group or that emerged from
their interactions outside their respective hospital
departments.
While carrying out their translational research, The Team
was evaluated through key performance indicators. Some of
the quantitative outputs expected to be generated (as deter-
mined by the research institute and the funding body)
included success in attracting further external funding, pub-
lications in peer reviewed journals, and patents or the devel-
opment of other intellectual property with industry potential.
Apart from placing these measures on The Team's perfor-
mance, the funding body and institute tied funding to the
training and career development of early career researchers
in The Team, which included postdoctoral fellows and
advanced clinical trainees.
Observations and Social Exchanges
From observation and conversation with the primary
researcher (first author), it became clear that The Team were
extremely excited about their collaborative venture. It was
new and different from the established research groups they
had worked with in the old medical research building, prior
to the relocation. This was expressed in a presentation they
made to their research institute, where a member of the audi-
ence said this research team had truly taken up the require-
ments of the grant by creating links that crossed the traditional
boundaries between various research groupings within the
organization.
Unfortunately though, their excitement was tempered by
the fact that their work occurred against a backdrop of com-
plications. During interactions with the primary researcher
(first author), it became clear that scientific work has changed
over the years, which, for some, was a source of irritation or
frustration.
Bill, a researcher with many years of experience in medi-
cal research, was quite concerned about those researchers
who were primarily focused on their own scientific careers
and the subsequent impact they had on fellow researchers,
and the quality of science being produced in general. He was
angered at how the PhD experience for many students was
no longer an opportunity for them to truly think critically;
rather, they were often "fodder" for larger research projects
headed by the well-funded and powerful senior researchers.
He also missed the days when "good results" in the labora-
tory were themselves sufficient rewards that made his work
worthwhile, rather than how many grants one accumulated.
Another participant, a basic scientist, explained the impact
of increased administration and managerial monitoring of
scientists by way of analogy through a PowerPoint
6 SAGE Open
Presentation on the Internet titled: The Ant: A Fable . . . or
May be Not . . . The narrative is about an ant who is very
productive and content with her work. The ant's boss believes
he could increase her productivity by hiring a supervisor,
who then needs their own staff and other resources. In the
end, increased managerial monitoring leads to the ant being
burdened by "this new plethora of paperwork and meetings
which used up most of her time" and "the Department where
the ant works is now a sad place, where nobody laughs any-
more and everybody has become upset." She is then fired
when a hired consultant believes the department is over-
staffed. In a similar fashion, scientists who are not able to
keep up with administration and managerial demands may
find themselves out of work.
Medical scientists and basic scientists were not the only
ones irritated. There also seems to be a professional culture
where clinicians who engage in research can only provide
time to the research project when their main work in patient
care has been addressed. Clara, a senior clinician, said, "One
thing I find frustrating especially with doctors in research is
that they seem to think [research] is not part of their core busi-
ness, so they do a lot of this thing where they have research
meetings after hours." In turn, this need to attend to patient
care first over research extends the working day for clinicians
and other researchers, which comprises the work/life balance.
Within The Team, a recurring point of discussion was the
increased time being spent on administration rather than scien-
tific work. Performing administrative tasks meant there was
less time for students or early career researcher mentoring, the
enjoyment that came from doing scientific experiments, dis-
cussing science, and creating research outputs, such as prepar-
ing and fine-tuning manuscripts for journal submission. This
issue was brought to the fore during a meeting between The
Team's members. Part of their funding was to support what
they considered to be an administrative arm of the research
institute. Thus, they believed the administrative arm should
then be able to assist them with at least some of their adminis-
trative tasks. The Team attempted to alleviate their administra-
tive work by writing a letter to the director of the institute
asking for certain administrative tasks to be redistributed. The
director replied in another letter that current resources would
not permit this but "at a broader level we are attempting to
address frustrating barriers to efficiency" through work on the
"Management Committee," which was a newly formed group
that represented members of the research facility.
A significant issue for The Team was how they could do
their translational research work, along with the administra-
tion work, whilst located in an organizational context that did
not seem to be helping them on administrative tasks. Further,
they were part of a broader research culture that at times
tainted the joy and reduced time for actual scientific research.
Cased-Based Themes
In light of the case description of The Team, we now move to
exploring themes that emerged from our case with community
of practice theory. This provides a means to investigate the
extent to which The Team can be considered a community of
practice. Moreover, the theory is a framework to continue to
explore the social relations and organization between the
members because their work is anchored in learning within an
organizational context.
Coming Together
Participation is the "process of taking part" and also attends
"to the relations with others that reflect this process" (Wenger,
1998, p. 55). In other words, when a community of practice
is being set up, people interact with each other to make it
happen.
However, the impetus to work together relies on broader
strategies. From a managerial point of view, strategy is a
"general plan to reach long-term objectives" of an organiza-
tion (Certo, 2000, p. 168). In particular, it seems there was a
strategy developed by a managerial element within the
research institute, known as the "Policy Committee," that
together with the benevolent foundation provided funding to
The Team. Sally, a scientist, suggested that the formation of
The Team was possible due to these broader strategies. She
went on to say, "I suspect, in terms of strategy, would it be
the Policy Committee and the [benevolent] foundation, look-
ing at how we could move things on" to "introduce some of
those changes of having people work together et cetera, so
there was big picture strategy." The phrase "big picture strat-
egy" indicates that overarching organizational elements,
such as the institute's management in conjunction with a
benevolent foundation, set up conditions within the research
institute to allow people to collaborate with members from
different research divisions in the institute. In this situation,
broader strategies were required to encourage people to
work with each other.
Although broader strategies demonstrate that an interest
to work together was influenced by external forces, The
Team needed to develop common interests. The most impor-
tant shared interest was the concern about researching the
mechanisms of chronic inflammation. Bob, a scientist, noted
that this was developed in the group formation stage as there
was:
Common knowledge that, okay, rheumatology has an
inflammatory interest. You know maybe the surgery department
might have had an inflammatory interest. You approach various
people and say you know how much of your work might interact
with this [i.e., research interest in inflammation] and if the
surgery people turn around and say: "Oh we're really more
interested in this." That expires and you go off, and you look for
somebody else.
A medical scientist, Pauline, also added that the common
interests were further developed when other people in the
institute heard about the potential project. Since chronic
inflammation was a common feature among them all, they
began to think how they could fit into The Team: "Then it
Krawczyk et al. 7
sort of becomes a shared thing and people become enthused
and passionate and excited."
Community of practice theory views common interests as
fundamental for a "joint enterprise" and involves the "nego-
tiated response to their [The Team's] situation and thus
belongs to them in a profound sense, in spite of all the forces
and influences that are beyond their control" (Wenger, 1998,
p. 78). Although it may seem that members of The Team
were encouraged to work together through managerial initia-
tives and grant incentives, the notion of a joint enterprise
suggests something much deeper about the human condi-
tion--the desire to belong to a group and create something
that cannot be achieved by an individual alone. For instance,
one medical scientist, in a stream-of-consciousness, recalled
how The Team developed their common interests:
We just met weekly didn't we? And the different personalities
kind of took over, so some people were good at one thing and
others good at another but . . . I guess it, it did more than money,
whilst the information is still with common interest so it benefits,
so research to be studying the same topic and sharing tissues and
samples.
The phrase, "it did more than money" implies that funding
was not the main driver for these professionals to collabo-
rate; rather, it was a pretext for their desire to collaborate in
an organizational environment that seemed to complicate
prospects of "human flourishing" through work (Alvesson,
Bridgman, & Willmott, 2011, p. 8). They discovered their
common interests at various "get togethers," where they con-
sidered how each person could make a contribution to the
larger project with the unique knowledge they had. There
also was a willingness to share materials for their research
project in terms of tissues and samples, which relates to the
joy of giving. With this in mind, common interests are not
simply about scientific knowledge as related to the project.
These common interests were underpinned by a sense of
altruism because these professionals wanted to belong and
make contributions to developing their translational research
project.
In this case, apart from the broader strategies encourag-
ing people to collaborate, the members took action by find-
ing common interests for the purpose of working together.
Members utilized the "common knowledge" of the existing
groups within the institute as a starting point to develop a
research direction that was distinctly owned by The Team.
This area of research was created by each professional's
desire to work together on a rewarding project, where shar-
ing their expertise and skill would provide personal and col-
lective satisfaction.
Finding common interests as linked to personal desires is
also grounded in a sense of participation and "relations with
others that reflect this process" of forming a group (Wenger,
1998, p. 55). This suggests there are some behaviors that aid
people in making the decision to work with each other.
Behaviors are defined here as embodied states of thinking
and emotion that manifest as observable human actions,
which for this Team is encapsulated in the subtheme of being
open. Being open means that during the group formation
stage, Team members had a sense of hospitality, experienc-
ing a state where people were welcoming and giving. This
subtheme of being open was demonstrated by the efforts that
Team members made to find ways to share knowledge and
resources for the research, as one member stated, "It was also
people being generous and looking at how we could work
together because sometimes people might be a bit protec-
tive." This quote also alludes to how people employed in sci-
entific research may not be so forthright in sharing scientific
resources, such as laboratory materials or knowledge (e.g.,
Hackett, 2005; Porter, 2013). It further emphasizes how The
Team was focused on developing an ethical collaboration
from the start of their work together, which was then
enshrined in their Memorandum of Understanding.
Learning From Others
Community of practice theory assisted in overturning the
mainstream pedagogical discourse "that learning is an indi-
vidual process . . . that it is best separated from the rest of our
activities, and that it is the result of teaching" (Wenger, 1998,
p. 3). Community of practice theory takes the view that
"learning is a fundamentally social phenomenon, reflecting
our own deeply social nature as human beings capable of
knowing" (Wenger, 1998, p. 3). This social understanding of
learning recognizes that people engage with each other to
make learning relevant to their shared interests.
Learning was clearly valued by The Team, as evidenced
from this comment by one member when asked what things
they had in common:
A desire to learn, I guess a desire to understand information
probably. I think each person comes with their own vision on
that but we're all heading toward the same direction . . . we're all
working on the same big framework. Each of us have got a
group of tiles that we're putting in.
Learning was underpinned by The Team's desire to find
out more about the underlying causes of chronic inflamma-
tion across several diseases, which would then progress to
testing the relevant clinical applications. One member of The
Team describes each professional in the group as having a
"group of tiles," which like a mosaic fits together to create a
picture. The metaphor describes what each member brings to
project through their education, training, and experience as
researchers. The act of "putting in" what knowledge they
bring led to the process of building relationships with one
another, to develop experiments to learn more about chronic
inflammation.
A social approach to learning was identified under the
subtheme of learning in practice. Wenger makes distinctions
8 SAGE Open
between various ways people can learn in practice; however,
of particular relevance is the idea of "legitimate peripheral
participation" (Wenger, 1998, p. 100). Legitimate peripheral
participation is necessary for the continuation of a commu-
nity of practice; it gives certain people who are interested in
joining a group the opportunity to become full-fledged mem-
bers, by learning the knowledge and skills that are relevant to
the group (Wenger, 1998). Legitimate peripheral participa-
tion is a situation where those members with less experience
are given "exposure to actual practice . . . a lesson that is
about the practice but takes place outside of it" (Wenger,
1998, p. 100). These persons witness actual work practices,
but may not be fully involved in what is being done.
For this research Team, legitimate peripheral participation
was identified as a form of learning in practice. Mark, a
junior scientist, was able to describe the experience of watch-
ing and asking questions of more experienced members, in
this case Mary, Geoffrey, and Joe, who were conducting
laboratory work with euthanized mice:
From the mouse work that we did, just the other week, um there
was a lot of, I guess while, um being the baby member watching
Mary, Geoffrey and Joe do what they do . . . I guess picked up
their technique through prior experience. But then I was sort of
the . . . person on their shoulder (laughs), having a look over to
see what they're doing and discussing it as they're doing it.
The term "baby member" signifies the participant's identifi-
cation as a person who does not have adequate knowledge
and skill to conduct this work. Mark noted he "picked up
their technique" through watching and asking questions from
the more experienced members of The Team. Learning in
practice in this group took place while laboratory work was
being done with junior members learning by watching more
highly skilled persons complete a task at hand.
Senior members of The Team also benefitted from learn-
ing in practice. In the description that follows, Alex, a senior
medical scientist, speaks about how a new technique for
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) work was introduced to
him by John, a PhD student, on The Team:
I will teach John the way that we do it in the lab and I've picked
up that from past experience myself from previous work and the
standard operating procedures . . . But I'm also willing to learn
and John's brought in a technique that he uses in the university
which is different to what we're using and I see that as the next
page if we ever you know did further PCR work . . . it actually
halves the amount of DNA from a sample that we're using and
still gets a good result. So, he's got a different way of doing
things so I'm actually learning as I'm teaching.
Wenger (1998) highlights that "encounters between genera-
tions are an aspect of practice that is most often understood
as learning" (p. 99). Knowledge learnt in practice is acquired
by the less experienced and usually younger person due to
the senior person providing some type of learning
opportunity. However, Wenger points out that learning in
practice can be "shared across generational discontinuities
precisely because it already is a social process of shared
learning" (p. 99). Even though Alex set up a situation where
John could learn how PCR work was done in the institute,
John taught him a more effective technique which used less
DNA material. Accordingly, learning in practice is a process
that challenges the idea that senior generations are responsi-
ble for teaching. Learning was thus infused in the practice of
this Team with all people widening their skill sets as they
interacted with each other.
Still, there are difficulties with learning in practice, which
compromises the value placed on learning in practice. One of
the difficulties identified was that there are time constraints
imposed on learning from others. Within The Team, time
seemed to be something that was measured and treated as a
scarce resource. Bill, a PhD student, emphasized time restric-
tions on learning from others by revealing that more experi-
enced Team members only had "a finite amount of time" to
demonstrate lab techniques. It has been noted that adminis-
tration work for many persons on The Team was in part
responsible for the shortage of time to work on actual scien-
tific research, which includes practical learning. Although it
is evident that learning in practice did occur in this Team,
more time for learning would have been welcomed, as they
each had a passion for scientific research and enjoyed learn-
ing from each other, especially for the benefit of their trans-
lational research project.
The limited time for learning was an issue for The Team
because "to support learning is not only to support the pro-
cess of acquiring knowledge, but also to offer a place where
new ways of knowing can be realized" (Wenger, 1998, p.
215). To put it another way, there are additional benefits in
fostering learning because different types of knowledge can
be created that ensures a community of practice's longevity
and relevancy in the translational research arena.
Shared Competencies
Skills and other things that are required for team members to
conduct their work properly are akin to the "shared reper-
toire" that is present in any community of practice (Wenger,
1998, p. 82). In community of practice theory, the:
Repertoire of a community of practice includes routines, words,
tools, ways of doing things, stories, gestures, symbols, genres,
actions, or concepts that the community has produced or adopted
in the course of its existence, and which have become part of its
practice. (Wenger, 1998, p. 83).
Hence, there are various resources that members can draw
upon for The Team's continuation as a community of
practice.
A way of identifying shared competencies, which can
assist in assessing whether the research team is a community
Krawczyk et al. 9
of practice, is to determine whether they have a "rehearsed
character" (Wenger, 1998, p. 83). In relation to this Team, a
significant shared competence was its knowledge of science.
This shared knowledge of science made the research possi-
ble; as one participant put it, "We've all basically done some
kind of science background, so we all understand the scien-
tific method; we all understand the procedures that we expect
to go through." With this knowledge of science, members
were able to follow through with their translational research
work. This shared knowledge of science suggests that unlike
previous studies, there were fewer issues with the profes-
sional divide between basic science and medicine (Cribb et
al., 2008; Wainwright et al., 2006; Wilson-Kovas &
Hauskeller, 2012) as science underpins both disciplines.
In building from this knowledge of science, members of
The Team recognized they were working as a group. The
subtheme of working as a group was brought to the fore by
Sue, a clinician. She reflected on why the group was so cohe-
sive, when her experience of other research teams was quite
different:
One of the things that struck me at the [research team's] meetings
and one of the reasons I think some of the members came to us
from other groups was that it's a . . . very professional sort of
group. All the people who are in [the research team] are very
professional about their interactions. I think um and I can say
having sat on some other groups and seeing some other scientists
and clinician-scientists that not all, not everyone, behaves in that
kind of professional manner towards each other.
The sense of professionalism that is tied to working as a
group refers to group-motivated behaviors, which were felt
by Team members to be orderly and fair. For example, in
formal meetings, authorship was discussed and attempts
were made to ensure that people received credit for their con-
tributions to the research. Or to put it more bluntly, as a
member stated, this is "a group where everyone is willing to
. . . give due credit to other people's ideas and not steal those
ideas."
Their ability of working as a group is anchored by the
notion of equality, as explained in the words of one scientist
on The Team:
We're equals as well aren't we? We all treat each other as people
who have your own expertise. Whereas in some of the other
groups there still is that leader, kind of looking down and . . . I
don't think we'll ever have that problem.
Their way of dispelling with hierarchical ways of working
was achieved by a preexisting sense of equality among the
members, which was formalized by the Memorandum of
Understanding they produced during the group formation
stage. What is interesting here is that working as a group and
having a sense of equality between Team members chal-
lenged the traditional way groups in this organization func-
tion. This is an example of Alvesson and Willmott's (1992)
idea of "microemancipation" as there are "temporary move-
ments that break away from diverse forms of oppression" (p.
447). The oppression they were combating was the pervasive
mentality of behaving in a manner that would treat people as
a means to an end for one's own research career advance-
ment, which is dissimilar to previous findings where "a ten-
sion persists between collaborative ideals of new bioscience
set-ups and the individual instincts of career development"
(Porter, 2013, p. 6). The shared repertoire of The Team
implemented a different form of organizing.
Conclusion and Future Research
The case study underscores the technical, social, and organi-
zational complexity of collaboration in translational research
by providing insights into collective lived experiences of
researchers in a translational research team, with particular
attention to the group's development.
The case description detailed The Team's composition
and how they aimed to create amicable relations between
themselves. In this organizational context, they were rather
unique as the individuals working together had broken away
from the traditional research groupings. They also needed to
work with various complications, which included issues with
persons in science concerned with their individual careers,
increased administration and managerial monitoring, along
with working hours of clinicians on research teams, and the
lack of direct organizational supports.
The case-based themes provided further contextual infor-
mation about The Team and offered an avenue to explore
whether they could be considered a community of practice.
Equally important, this discussion provides further informa-
tion into how The Team worked together and organized
themselves. Although wider organizational structures had
provided an invitation for collaboration across the conven-
tional research groupings, the members of The Team created
their own joint enterprise through sharing gifts of knowledge
by being open and were learning in practice from each other
in numerous ways. What is most interesting is that their
shared repertoire showed a commitment to working as a
group as underpinned by the sense of equality between mem-
bers. This suggests The Team organized themselves in a less
hierarchical fashion and had less tolerance for a general pro-
fessional culture of individualized career advancement
(Porter, 2013). The case study was able to reveal an alterna-
tive way professionals organized themselves for a transla-
tional research project and more research is needed to further
appreciate the ways such professionals organize.
The Team also had a sense of being a part of a community
of practice given that they developed a shared research inter-
est and had some common behaviors and values that made
their learning possible. Questions remain about the optimal
level or perhaps the quality of learning in practice, as admin-
istration work for all researchers and patient care for clini-
cians took time away from learning from others. What then
10 SAGE Open
is evident from the analysis, and most unfortunate, is that
The Team were not able to fully realize the potential of learn-
ing from each other.
To better understand why learning was not optimized, it
would be now worthwhile to investigate how the wider
sociopolitical context defines, values, and regulates what
counts as learning. Exploring learning in such a manner may
create opportunities to widen the parameters of what and
how professionals on translational research projects learn.

Notes
1. For more information on what translational research is, Woolf's
(2008) seminal article is an indispensable introduction.
2. Translational research projects require professionals from var-
ious disciplines and subdisciplines, such as basic scientists and
physicians (Woolf, 2008). The professional identities these
people bring to a collaborative venture may lead to certain
frictions. Coller (2008) provides rather astute cultural obser-
vations between basic scientists and physicians, which help
one imagine how these different professional identities could
face some challenges when working together on translational
projects.
3. The scope of Therapeutic Innovation Australia seems to take
a less broad understanding of translational research than the
U.S. National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
This U.S. governmental entity has an ambitious translational
research program that understands that the "inclusion of
patient-centered research, community engagement, training,
dissemination science, and behavioral research is extremely
important to the translation and application of basic science
discoveries" (U.S. House of Representatives, 2012, p. 1137).
4. The process of translational research, which has an extensive
and fascinating history, is not a recent phenomenon in the sci-
ences (see Hetzel, 2005; Keating & Cambrosio, 2012; Löwy,
1997; Martina, Brown, & Kraft, 2008).
5. Ethical collaboration is an observance of "virtuous character
traits" in the scientific community that minimizes harm to
fellow colleagues, which includes individuals being "other
regarding as well as self-regarding, empathetic and committed
to the collaboration as well as the goal or goals of the collabo-
ration" (McGowan, McGowan, & McGowan, 2011, p. 129).
