Nutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture Risk among a National Cohort of
White Women
Zhiping Huang, John H. Himes, and Paul G. McGovem
This study investigated three aspects of general nutritional status (dietary intake, biochemical markers, and
anthropometric measurements) in relation to subsequent hip fracture risk by using prospective data from the
First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) epidemiologic follow-up studies. A cohort
of 2,513 white women 45 years and over who participated in the NHANES I survey in 1971-1975 were
subsequently followed in the three follow-up studies in 1982-1984, 1986, and 1987, respectively. Multiple
nutritional variables were measured at baseline, and 130 incident hip fractures were identified by hospital
records or by death certificates during the follow-up period. Cox regression analyses showed that baseline
dietary energy intake; serum albumin; and weight, body mass index, skinfold, and arm muscle area were
significantly and inversely related to subsequent hip fracture risk (relative risks for a 1-standard deviation
increment in these variables ranged from 0.68 to 0.83). The authors suggest that poor nutritional status,
evident in inadequate dietary intake, reduced serum albumin, and decreased body mass and soft tissues,
increases the risk for subsequent hip fracture. The study also showed that age and previous fracture history
were significant risk factors; however, self-reported physical activity, parity, and alcohol use were not
significantly related to subsequent hip fracture. Am J Epidemiol 1996;144:124-34.

Nutrition is one of the important factors that influ-
ence bone health and hip fracture risk. The majority of
previous studies have investigated only selected as-
pects of nutrition in relation to osteoporosis. Most
studies have focused on the associations between di-
etary calcium intake and bone mass or fracture risk.
However, in order to evaluate the association between
general nutritional status and hip fracture risk, multi-
ple aspects of nutrition including dietary intake, bio-
chemical markers, and anthropometric measurements
need to be considered simultaneously. Several clinical
studies have documented that elderly patients with hip
fracture are likely to have poorer nutritional status on
admission to the hospital (1). Serum concentrations of
several nutritional indicators, especially albumin, are
below normal levels (2). Many patients fail to receive

adequate intakes of most nutrients. The mean intakes
of calories, protein, and calcium are only about 60
percent of the recommended dietary allowance for
elderly people (3). The poor nutritional status of hip
fracture patients is further evident in their general
emaciation and scarcity of muscle and fat tissues (4).
Although malnutrition is often observed in the elderly,
it appears that the situation is much worse in the
patients with hip fractures than in the general aging
population (5). The above studies suggest that poor
nutritional status is associated with increased risk of
hip fracture. However, nutritional status was measured
after the occurrence of hip fracture in these studies, so
that the temporal sequence of events was unclear. Few
cohort studies have been done to prospectively inves-
tigate whether general nutritional status affects subse-
quent hip fracture risk.
The objective of this study is to investigate the
relation between general nutritional status and subse-
quent hip fracture risk in white women aged 45 years
and over by using prospective data from the First
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I) and its three follow-up studies. The
hypothesis is that poor nutritional status, reflected by
inadequate dietary intake, altered biochemical levels,
124

and reduced body mass and soft tissues, increases the
risk for subsequent hip fracture. Selected aspects of
the data have been analyzed before. Looker et al. (6)
investigated the relation between dietary calcium in-
take and hip fracture risk and did not find a statistically
significant association. Farmer et al. (7) and DiPietro
et al. (8) examined anthropometric indicators and hip
fracture risk and found that women with higher body
mass index, arm muscle area, and triceps skinfold
thickness experienced a lower risk of hip fracture. In
the present study, multiple variables from three as-
pects of nutrition including dietary intake, biochemical
markers, and anthropometric measurements are inves-
tigated simultaneously in relation to subsequent hip
fracture to more completely examine the association
between general nutritional status and hip fracture
risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and population
NHANES I was conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics in 1971-1975 on a multistage,
stratified, probability sample of the civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized population in the United States. The sam-
ple included 23,808 people from 1 to 74 years of age.
A wide variety of nutrition information was collected
in this survey. Then, three NHANES I epidemiologic
follow-up studies were conducted in 1982-1984,
1986, and 1987, respectively. The 1982-1984
follow-up study included 14,407 subjects who were
25-74 years of age and who underwent medical ex-
amination in NHANES I. The 1986 follow-up study
was conducted on those who were 55-74 years old at
the NHANES I baseline examination and not known to
be deceased at the 1982-1984 follow-up study, regard-
less of their tracing status in that study. The follow-up
cohort included 3,980 eligible persons. The third
follow-up study took place in 1987. The entire non-
deceased follow-up cohort aged 25-74 years at base-
line (11,750 persons) was recontacted, regardless of
whether they had previously been followed. The de-
sign and data collection procedures of these three
follow-up studies were very similar. Data collection
consisted of interviews with the subjects or with their
proxies for those who were incapacitated or deceased,
acquiring death certificates for decedents, and obtain-
ing health care facility (hospital and nursing home)
overnight stay records for all subjects. All hospital and
nursing home records were receded by trained medical
coders using International Classification of Diseases,
Ninm Revision (ICD-9), codes. Death certificates
were coded by using the ICD-9 multiple cause-of-
deatii codes.
The subjects for the present study were restricted to
a cohort of 3,544 white women who were aged 45
years or older and who had a medical examination in
the NHANES I. In total, 3,335 of the eligible women
were followed in at least one of the follow-up studies,
and 209 women (5.9 percent) were lost to follow-up in
the three follow-up studies. Six women with hip frac-
tures caused by severe trauma were excluded from the
study. In addition, 764 women with malignant tumors
or incomplete information on baseline variables were
excluded from the analysis. The final cohort included
2,565 white women.
Measurement methods
Height, weight, upper arm girth, triceps skinfold,
and subscapular skinfold were measured in the
NHANES I by standardized procedures with the sub-
ject wearing only a paper gown and foam rubber
slippers (9, 10). Body mass index was calculated as
weight (kg)/height (m)2. The average of triceps and
subscapular skinfolds was computed and used in the
data analysis. Arm muscle area (cm2) was calculated
as an indicator of protein-energy malnutrition by using
the Heymsfield formula (11): arm muscle area =
[(upper arm girth -- 3.14 X triceps skinfold)2/(4 X
3.14)] - 6.5.
A dietary interview including a 24-hour dietary re-
call and a food frequency questionnaire was conducted
by professional dietary staff in the NHANES I. The
intakes of total energy, carbohydrate, protein, calcium,
and phosphorus were computed from uie 24-hour di-
etary recall data. The food frequency questionnaire
was administered to obtain the usual frequencies of
consumption of food items during the preceding 3
months (12, 13). The total frequency of consumption
of dairy products including whole milk, skim milk,
cheese, and cheese dishes was derived from the food
frequency questionnaire and used as an independent
variable in the data analyses.
A blood sample was drawn by venipuncture at base-
line examination. Serum total protein and albumin
were assessed by using standard laboratory techniques
(14).
Covariates of interest included age, menopausal sta-
tus, parity, physical activity, alcohol use, and previous
fracture history. All of them were collected in the
baseline survey. Menopausal status was determined by
asking the subject whether her menstrual periods had
entirely stopped at the time of the NHANES I. Parity
status was categorized as high parity (three live births
or more), low parity (less than three live births), and
null parity. The frequency of alcohol drinking was
dichotomized as frequent (drinking from two to three
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 144, No. 2, 1996
126 Huang et al.
times a week or more) and less frequent (drinking less
frequently than from two to three times a week or
never). The information about physical activity was
derived by asking the respondents two questions about
their recreational and nonrecreational activities. The
respondents reported their activities as active, moder-
ate, or inactive. Physical activity was categorized as
"high" if the responses to both questions were active,
"low" if the responses to both questions were inactive,
and "medium" if the responses were all other combi-
nations of answers to the two questions. A previous
history for any bone fracture was categorized as "pos-
itive" and "negative" according to self-reports.
Hip fracture outcomes
In the three follow-up interviews, the respondents
were asked questions on hip fracture. Hip fracture was
included only if the date at which the fracture occurred
was after the date of the NHANES I interview; other-
wise, the fracture was treated as a previous hip frac-
ture. Altogether, 153 women reported incident nip
fractures.
The hospital and nursing home records collected in
the three follow-up studies were searched for the di-
agnosis of hip fracture (ICD-9 code 820). All death
certificates received were also searched for ICD-9
code 820 for hip fracture. In total, 130 incident hip
fractures caused by low-energy trauma (ascertained by
checking the external causes for hip fractures on the
hospital records) were identified either by the health
care facility records or by death certificates.
Self-reported hip fractures were validated by health
care facility records and death certificates. As a result,
101 cases were confirmed by either facility records or
death certificates; 52 self-reported hip fractures were
not verified; 29 hip fractures were not reported but
uncovered in records or death certificates.
The information from health care facility records
and death certificates was used to define incident hip
fracture cases. Thus, only 130 hip fractures identified
by health care facility records or by death certificates
were treated as cases; the 52 unconfirmed self-
reported hip fractures were excluded from the analy-
sis. The final analysis included 2,513 white women
with 130 incident hip fractures.
Data analysis
Nutritional variables and covariates collected in the
baseline survey were compared between women with
and without a subsequent hip fracture by using the
Student t test for continuous variables and x* test for
categorical variables.
The relations between baseline nutritional variables
and subsequent hip fracture risk were examined by
using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.
Crude and age-adjusted analyses were conducted first.
Nutritional variables and age were entered into Cox
models as continuous independent variables, with the
follow-up time to incident hip fracture as the depen-
dent variable. The time to incident hip fracture for hip
fracture cases was defined as the time between the
baseline interview and the date of the first incident hip
fracture. For noncases, the follow-up time was com-
puted as the time between the baseline interview and
the date of the last interview for survivors or between
the baseline interview and the date of death for dece-
dents. Crude and age-adjusted relative risks were com-
puted as the exponents of the regression coefficients.
The relation between nutrition and subsequent hip
fracture risk was further examined by multiple vari-
able Cox regression analysis. Because nutritional vari-
ables tend to be correlated with each other and because
high collinearity among variables would result in an
unstable model in multiple-variable analysis, only the
most significant and representative variables or the
relatively independent variables were selected from
each aspect of nutrition for the final analysis. Since
weight, body mass index, skinfold, upper arm girth,
and arm muscle area were highly correlated with each
other (correlation coefficients from 0.40 to 0.92) and
since body weight includes both fat and muscle com-
ponents, it is reasonable to assume that weight can
adequately represent skinfold, upper arm girth, and
arm muscle area. Although body mass index is another
important variable, it was calculated from weight and
height and not independent from other measures of
body size. Thus, weight was chosen for the multiple-
variable analysis. Height was a relatively independent
variable, so that it was used for the multiple-variable
analysis. Dietary variables from the 24-hour recall
interview were also correlated with each other (corre-
lation coefficients ranged from 0.38 to 0.82). Since
total energy intake includes protein and carbohydrate
intakes and is closely related to calcium and phospho-
rus intakes, it seems that total energy intake is the most
reasonable variable to represent general dietary intake.
Hence, total energy intake was selected for the
multiple-variable analysis. Among the biochemical
variables tested, only serum albumin was significantly
(p < 0.05) related to subsequent hip fracture risk;
thus, it was used to represent biochemical markers in
the multiple-variable analysis. In order to ensure that
variable selection was sound, several multiple-variable
models containing different anthropometric variables
were compared. The model with height and weight
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 144, No. 2, 1996
Nutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 127
was the best-fit model in terms of the log likelihood
ratio test. No other anthropometric variables achieved
statistical significance in the model including height
and weight. Likewise, the model containing dietary
total energy intake was the best-fit model compared
with those with other dietary variables, and no other
dietary variables reached significant levels in the
model containing total energy intake. Thus, the final
multiple-variable model included height, weight, total
energy intake, and serum albumin while simulta-
neously controlling for covariates, i.e., age, previous
fracture history, menopausal status, parity, physical
activity, and frequency of alcohol use.
RESULTS
The average length of follow-up was 13.4 years.
The incidence rates of hip fracture for various age
groups are shown in table 1. The rates of hip fracture
increased substantially with age. Women older than 70
years had a rate 13 times higher than younger women
aged 45-49 years.
Table 2 compares basic characteristics between
women with and without subsequent hip fracture.
Women with hip fracture were 6 years older on aver-
age. Their anthropometric measurements were gener-
ally smaller. They had significantly lower body
weight, body mass index, skinfold, upper arm girth,
and arm muscle area measurements than women with-
out hip fracture. The differences between the two
groups also appeared in biochemical markers. The
serum albumin level was significantly lower in the hip
fracture group, although the difference in serum total
protein was not statistically significant. Women who
developed a subsequent hip fracture tended to have
poorer dietary intakes; their total energy, carbohy-
drate, protein, and phosphorus intakes were signifi-
cantly lower; and their calcium intakes were margin-

ally lower than those of women without hip fracture.
Nevertheless, there was little difference between the
two groups in the total frequency of dairy product
consumption. As for the differences in covariates,
significantly higher percentages of women with sub-
sequent hip fracture were postmenopausal and had
previous fracture history. The percentage distributions
with regard to physical activity, parity, and frequency
of alcohol use were not significantly different between
the two groups.
The crude and age-adjusted relative risks of subse-
quent hip fracture associated with a 1-standard devia-
tion increment in independent variables (relative risk
for age was relative to a 10-year increment) are pre-
sented in table 3 along with 95 percent confidence
intervals. Age was significantly related to hip fracture.
A 10-year increment in age resulted in a 3.42-fold
increase in subsequent hip fracture risk. When anthro-
pometric measurements except height were increased
1 standard deviation, the crude and age-adjusted rela-
tive risks for hip fracture significantly decreased by
24-31 percent. For biochemical markers, both crude
and age adjusted, a reduced serum albumin concentra-
tion was associated with increased risk of subsequent
hip fracture, whereas serum total protein was not sig-
nificantly related to hip fracture risk. The crude rela-
tive risks for a 1-standard deviation increase in dietary
total energy, carbohydrate, protein, and phosphorus
intakes ranged from 0.74 to 0.77 and were statistically
significant. However, after controlling for age, we
found that only the relative risk for dietary carbohy-
drate remained statistically significant. The crude and
age-adjusted relative risks for dietary calcium intake
and total frequency of dairy product consumption did
not achieve statistical significance.
The multiple-variable-adjusted relative risks are
presented in table 4. The multivariable relative risk for
age was similar to the crude relative risk estimate,
indicating that age was an independent risk factor for
hip fracture. The inverse relations between body
weight, serum albumin, and total energy intake and hip
fracture remained significant in the multiple-variable
model, suggesting that poor nutritional status, re-
flected from reduced body mass, low serum albumin
concentration, and inadequate dietary intake, may el-
evate the risk for subsequent hip fracture. The
multiple-variable analysis also indicated that height
was a significant risk factor for hip fracture.
To further examine the association between levels
of nutritional status and hip fracture risk, nutritional
variables were divided into several categories by per-
centiles. Figure 1 presents the multiple-variable-
adjusted relative risks according to the percentiles of

serum albumin. Using the group with serum albumin
above the 75th percentile as reference, we show that
reduced serum albumin increased the risk for subse-
quent hip fracture. When serum albumin was de-
creased to the first percentile or less, the risk of hip
fracture was dramatically increased by threefold (p <
0.05), which suggests a possible threshold effect at the
extremely low values. Likewise, figures 2, 3, and 4
display the multiple-variable-adjusted relative risks
according to the percentiles of total energy intake,
body weight, and height. A striking increase in hip
fracture risk (relative risk = 3.67, p < 0.05) was
observed when total energy intake was reduced to the
first percentile or less. As body weight decreased, the
risk for subsequent hip fracture was dramatically in-
creased, especially at extremely low values. Decreased
body height was significantly associated with de-
creased risk of hip fracture after adjusting for multiple
variables. These data strongly suggest that undernutri-
tion substantially increases the risk for subsequent hip
fracture in elderly women.
The multiple-variable analysis also showed that pre-
vious fracture history was an important predictor for
subsequent hip fracture. Those who had a previous
bone fracture experienced a higher risk for hip fracture
compared with those without previous fracture (rela-
tive risk = 2.47, 95 percent confidence interval 1.62-
3.75). Physical activity, menopausal status, parity, and
frequency of alcohol use were not significant in the
multiple-variable analysis.
Possible interactions among independent variables
were explored by adding interaction terms into the
multiple-variable model, and none of the interactions
achieved statistical significance {p > 0.05).
DISCUSSION
This prospective study investigated three aspects of
nutritional status simultaneously in relation to subse-
quent hip fracture risk. It was shown that poor nutri-
tional status, reflected from inadequate dietary energy
intake, reduced serum albumin, and decreased body
mass and soft tissues, was significantly associated
with higher risk of subsequent hip fracture.

portant nutrient that influences bone mass and bone

fracture risk, this study showed that dietary calcium
was only marginally related to hip fracture risk. This
result is not surprising. Previous research has indicated
that dietary calcium may exert the greatest impact on
the bone during childhood and adolescence rather than
in late adulthood. Higher dietary calcium intake during
childhood and adolescence results in greater calcium
retention and skeletal deposition; therefore, it pro-
motes maximal peak bone mass (15-17). After peak
bone mass has been reached, calcium intake is related
to bone mass maintenance. Although it is assumed that
adequate calcium intake will retard bone mineral loss
and help to reduce bone fracture risk (18, 19), evi-
dence for a direct relation between dietary calcium
intake and bone mineral content and hip fracture risk
is weak and inconsistent. In the four prospective stud-
ies that directly investigated the relation between cal-
cium intake and hip fracture risk, only one study
showed that higher calcium intake was linked to a
significant decrease in subsequent risk of hip fracture
(6, 20-22). Because any particular nutrient occurs in
foods along with other nutrients, the multicollinearity
among nutrients makes it very difficult to separate the
effect of a particular nutrient from another. It may be
that not just one particular nutrient but the combined
effects of nutrients, the general dietary intake, and
nutritional status are important in determining bone
health and subsequent hip fracture risk.
This study showed that reduced serum albumin con-
centration was significantly associated with a higher
risk of hip fracture, whereas serum total protein was
not related to hip fracture risk. Serum albumin is one
of the common biochemical parameters to monitor
nutritional status. Because the half-life of albumin is
only 20 days (23) and because an early effect of
protein deprivation is to reduce albumin synthesis and
result in hypoalbuminemia (24), serum albumin is a
sensitive indicator of early nutritional inadequacy. Se-
rum total protein includes different kinds of serum
proteins that may have different responses to nutri-
tional inadequacy. Thus, serum total protein content is

ture risk suggests that nutritional inadequacy in elderly
women significantly increases the risk for subsequent
hip fracture.
The multiple-variable analysis indicated that the in-
verse associations of weight, serum albumin, and total
energy intake with hip fracture were largely indepen-
dent of each other and the other variables included in
the model. The dramatic increases in relative risks at
the extremely low values of serum albumin, total en-
ergy intake, and weight strongly suggest that poor
nutritional status elevates the risk for hip fracture in
elderly women. Although the extremely low values
might be associated with measurement error, the risks
related to these values were striking and statistically
significant, suggesting that the observed risks could
not be explained by measurement error alone and that
there might be threshold effects.
Height was not significant in the crude and age-
adjusted analyses, but it became a significant risk
factor for hip fracture in the multiple-variable analysis.
This is because when other variables, especially
weight, are uncontrolled, height hardly reflects wom-
en's current nutritional status. When holding weight
and other variables constant, taller women are rela-
tively thinner, have less soft tissue, and are therefore at
greater risk for hip fracture. This agrees with the result
that poor nutritional status and thinness in elderly
women are linked to higher risk of hip fracture.
There is a biologic basis for an association between
nutritional status and hip fracture risk. First, poor
nutritional status adversely influences bone health.
Inadequate dietary intake and nutritional deficiency
may negatively affect the balance between bone for-
mation and bone resorption, thereby influencing bone
fragility and inducing osteoporosis (25). It has also
been hypothesized that women with greater body mass
have more estrogen, which may significantly decrease
bone loss and protect against osteoporotic fractures
(26-28). In addition, heavier weight may exert a sig-
nificant mechanical loading on the bone (29), which is
an important stimulus for bone gain, and therefore
may lead to greater bone density and reduced fracture
risk. Second, poor nutritional status contributes to
general feebleness, which increases the propensity to
fall and thereby the risk of hip fracture by influencing
central nervous system processing time, impairing co-
ordination, and reducing muscle strength (4, 30).
Third, poor nutritional status may affect a mechanical
protective mechanism. Undernourished elderly indi-
viduals have less muscle and fat tissues around the hip,
and therefore less soft tissue padding and passive
protection, which may increase the risk of developing
an osteoporotic hip fracture when falls occur (1, 31).
The results from this study agree with those from
other studies that age is a strong risk factor for hip
fracture (32). Many factors may change with age, such
as quantitative and qualitative aspects of the bone,
increased frequency of falling, and deteriorating nutri-
tional status, which may contribute to the increasing
risk of hip fracture with increasing age (33).
As found in other studies (34, 35), previous fracture
history is another significant risk factor. The women
having previous fractures are generally more osteopo-
rotic and two times more likely to have a subsequent
hip fracture.
The crude analysis in this study showed that post-
menopausal women were four times more likely to
develop a hip fracture than premenopausal women.
However, menopausal status was closely related to age
so that, after adjusting for age, the relation between
menopausal status and hip fracture risk was no longer
significant.
·Self-reported physical activity was not significantly
linked to hip fracture risk in this study. One possibility
is that physical activity might not be accurately mea-
sured by self-report. Because different individuals
may have different interpretations about physical ac-
tivity levels, the self-reported activity might be asso-
ciated with considerable misclassification. Previous
studies have indicated that total energy intake can be
used as a measure of long-term habitual physical ac-
tivity (36). If this is so, the significant inverse associ-
ation between total energy intake and hip fracture risk
in this study may suggest that reduced physical activ-
ity is related to increased risk of hip fracture.
Some studies have suggested that high parity may
protect against osteoporotic fractures (37). However,
not all of the studies have observed the favorable
effects. This study showed that women with three live
births or more had a risk of developing a subsequent
hip fracture similar to the risk of those with null parity.
Most of the subjects in this study were not heavy
drinkers, which might be the reason why we could not
find a relation between alcohol use and hip fracture
risk. The data from other studies showed that only
long-term and heavy alcohol consumption was asso-
ciated with a modestly increased risk of hip fracture in
women (38).
The above analyses were repeated by an alternative
approach of defining hip fracture cases. All incident
hip fractures identified by facility records, death cer-
tificates, or self-reporting were treated as cases; that is,
the 52 unconfirmed self-reported hip fractures were
included as cases. This approach accommodated the
facts that the health care facility record data were not
complete, some records could not be obtained because
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 144, No. 2, 1996
Nutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 133
the subjects refused to sign the Medical Authorization
Form, or the hospitals and nursing homes refused to
participate or could not be contacted. It was based on
the rationale that hip fracture is a quite distinct event,
and the recall for hip fracture is relatively accurate.
This approach included 2,565 white women with 182
incident hip fractures. The results from this approach
showed that the directions of the relations between
nutritional variables and hip fracture risk remained the
same; however, the magnitudes of the associations
were attenuated, and the relative risks became less
significant (data not shown). It is suggested that the
second approach of case definition was associated
with appreciable misclassification in the outcome vari-
able, and there existed some extent of reporting error
in self-reported hip fracture data. Hence, data interpre-
tation and conclusions should be based on the first
approach.
In summary, nutritional status is significantly linked
to subsequent hip fracture risk. Poor nutritional status,
evident in inadequate dietary intake, decreased serum
albumin, and reduced body mass and soft tissues,
predisposes women to hip fracture. Thus, maintaining
a well-nourished status in the elderly should be con-
sidered as one important approach to prevent hip
fracture.
