In view of the catalytic role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in promoting economic
development, countries adopt various unilateral as well as bilateral arrangements to
create a conducive environment for FDI. One such significant form of arrangement is
bilateral investment treaties (BITs). As sizeable cost and resources are involved in treaty
formation, it becomes important to examine the potential benefits of BITs for investment
and whether such measures actually translate into higher FDI flows.
This article employs panel data regression on an augmented gravity model (under both
static and dynamic conditions) to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into India with a
special focus on the role of BITs. The panel data span over the period 2001­2012 and include
the top investing countries in India accounting for around 92 per cent of India's total FDI
inflows. The explanatory variables employed are extended market size, vertical FDI drive,
distance, colonial links, common language, political stability, financial openness, and popu-
lation growth rate. BIT is incorporated as a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if a BIT
exists between India and the investing countries in a given year, otherwise 0.
The results for both the fixed effects and the two-step generalized method of moments
(GMM) model specifications confirm the positive role of BITs in attracting FDI inflows
into India. BITs have contributed to rising FDI inflows by providing protection and
commitment to foreign investors contemplating investment in India. The model also
finds support for other factors facilitating FDI such as the large size of the economy and
a more liberal FDI regime.
As attracting FDI is an important policy objective of developing countries like India, the
results imply that one of the instruments of achieving this objective is for the govern-
ment to negotiate BITs with countries which are prospective investors. By laying down
clear guidelines with respect to investment and widening the scope of investment activ-
ities covered under a bilateral agreement, an environment of certainty is created which
would facilitate FDI flows.

Summary
276 DO BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES PROMOTE FDI INFLOWS? EVIDENCE FROM INDIA
The last three decades have been marked by a
tremendous growth of international investments
and trade along with the integration and open-
ness of international markets. This has led to intense
competition among countries, particularly the devel-
oping ones, to attract FDI so as to boost their domestic
rates of investment and accelerate economic develop-
ment. FDI flows are usually preferred over other forms
of external finance because they are non-debt creating,
less volatile, and facilitate transfer of knowledge, skills,
and technology (Bhasin, 2012).
In view of the catalytic role of FDI in promoting
economic development, countries adopt various unilat-
eral as well as bilateral measures to create a conducive
environment for FDI. The bilateral measures include,
inter alia, double taxation avoidance agreements and
BITs. The focus of this article is on BITs which are
agreements that establish the terms and conditions
for FDI in a country. According to UNCTAD, `Bilat-
eral investment treaties are agreements between two
countries for reciprocal encouragement, promotion
and protection of investment in each other's territo-
ries by companies based in either country' (UNCTAD,
n.d.). As on 31 January 2015, around 3,000 BITs had
been negotiated across the world, of which 2,225 are in
force (UNCTAD, n.d.). The scope and depth of BITs are
expanding in terms of intra-regional and inter-regional
coverage, which, in turn, is expected to strengthen the
flow of investment among economies. Most of the BITs
contain provisions for investment covering establish-
ment clauses, legal provisions, tax norms, dispute reso-
lution procedures, administrative specifications, and
other related protocols. They also promote equal treat-
ment towards domestic as well as foreign investors.
Such arrangements create an environment of certainty
for the foreign investors and, hence, are perceived as
investment-friendly. At the same time, it needs to be
noted that treaty formation involves sizeable costs and
resources of the governments. In the light of above, it
becomes important to examine the potential benefits of
BITs for investment and whether such measures actu-
ally translate into higher FDI flows.
The literature review presented further shows that of
the existing studies that cover the impact of BITs on
FDI flows into developing countries, there are very
few country-based studies. An aggregative study may
not be able to account for the peculiarities of a country
which, in turn, could define the objective of BITs. For
instance, for a country that has started liberalizing, a
BIT may hold more importance as it could attract more
investment partners. In comparison, countries that have
already been attracting foreign investment for a long
period could enter into BITs to facilitate flows from their
existing partners. We focus on the case of India as it is one
of the top prospective destinations for FDI (UNCTAD,
2014a) and also because it has been a part of the growing
trend of negotiating BITs to facilitate cross-border invest-
ment flow. India has been progressively liberalizing its
FDI policy since 1991, which has resulted in an upward
surge in FDI inflows. FDI inflows in India in the early
1990 were less than USD 1 billion and were more than
doubled to exceed USD 2 billion in 1995. After 2005, FDI
flows saw a steep increase from USD 20 billion in 2006
to nearly USD 35 billion in 2009 (UNCTAD, 2014a). To
promote FDI inflows, India has entered into a number of
arrangements with other countries such as double taxa-
tion avoidance agreements, free trade agreements, and
BITs. A number of studies have looked at the impact of
these diverse arrangements on India's trade and FDI. For
instance, Murthy and Bhasin (2015) captured the impact
of one form of bilateral arrangement, that is, bilateral
taxation treaties, on India's FDI inflows. Another set of
studies examined the impact of globalization and trade
agreements on India's trade (Bhasin & Manocha, 2014;
Srinivasan & Archana, 2009). However, the literature on
the impact of BITs on FDI flows into India is relatively
sparse. We, therefore, attempt to understand the deter-
minants of India's FDI inflows with a special focus on
the role of BITs of India.
TREND OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES
IN INDIA
India has been actively negotiating BITs since liberali-
zation to intensify cross-border flows of investment. It
had only one BIT (in force) in 1995, but till 2013, there
were 69 BITs in force out of the 84 negotiated (UNCTAD,
n.d.). An upward trend in BITs for India can be seen in
Figure 1. In developing countries like India, investment
treaties are considered as a commitment to protect
investors and to provide them with a more certain,
predictable, and supportive environment. Investors
contemplating FDIs require better institutional quality,
supportive policies, and reduced restrictions on entry
and operation. A comparison of FDI trends along with
trends in BITs shows that along with an upward trend
in BITs, India has also experienced a surge in the total
FDI inflows in the last two decades (Figure 1). Post-
liberalization, India is constantly working towards
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 277
establishing a conducive environment for FDI, and BITs
are a significant step in this direction.
Table 1 brings out the importance of treaty partners as
source countries for India's FDI flows. Of the total FDI
flows received in 2001, 72.6 per cent were received from
BIT partners and the percentage increased to 81.4 per
cent in 2012. Further, the number of BITs negotiated has
increased from 32 in 2001 to 68 in 2012. Thus, over time,
the propensity to sign BITs has increased along with the
proportion of FDI received from treaty partners.

Region-wise distribution indicates that most of India's
BITs are with Asian and European economies. This
could possibly be due to geographical proximity as
well as the fact that many of these countries have been
traditional trade and investment partners of India.

LITERATURE REVIEW
We look at some of the recent literature capturing the
relationship between investment treaties and invest-
ment flows. While some studies estimated a positive
association between BITs and FDI flows, others did
not come up with such encouraging results. Studies
by Hallward-Driemeier (2003) and Tobin and Rose-
Ackerman (2004) found a negative relationship
between FDI and BITs. Hallward-Driemeier (2003)
analyzed the impact of BITs using bilateral FDI flows
from 20 OECD countries to 31 developing countries
and found that BITs did not serve to attract addi-
tional FDI. Tobin and Rose-Ackerman (2003) found
the number of BITs having little impact on a coun-
try's ability to attract FDI. However, there appears to
be an interaction between the conclusion of BITs, on
the one hand, and the level of political risk and prop-
erty rights protection, on the other. Countries that are
relatively risky seem to be able to attract somewhat
more FDI by signing BITs. Mina (2010), using the
panel data for the period 1984­2002 and adopting a
GMM estimation methodology, found that domestic
property rights protection institutions, as opposed to
BITs, mattered more for OECD investors with invest-
ment coming from higher income, middle income,
and lower income economies. Banga (2003) estimated
the impact of the total number of signed BITs on FDI
inflows for 15 developing economies of South Asia,
East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The study found that
BITs with developing countries did not have a signif-
icant impact on aggregate FDI inflows but those
with developed countries had a significant impact
on FDI inflows. The author attributed such result to
large aggregate FDI flows from developed economies
in the sample covered.
A number of studies on developed countries found
BITs to support FDI inflows (Bae & Keum, 2013;
Egger & Pfaffermayr, 2004; Grosse & Trevino, 2005;
Guerin, 2011). Egger and Pfaffermayr (2004) used
bilateral outward FDI stock data from 19 OECD
home countries and 57 host countries (including 27
OECD member countries) to show that BITs exerted
a positive and significant effect on outward FDI of
home countries in BITs partner host countries, if
the treaties were implemented. Grosse and Trevino
(2005) examined the impact of BITs on FDIs in 13
countries of Central and Eastern Europe during
1990­1999 and found that foreign investors viewed
BITs (together with other institutional improve-
ments) as an assurance of equal treatment of foreign
and domestic investors. Guerin (2011) concluded that
BITs encouraged EU FDI outflows up to 35 per cent
with a partner developing economy. Bae and Keum
(2013), covering Korean investment, found BITs
significant and positive for outward FDI but negative
and insignificant for inward FDI. Cardamone and
Scoppola (2012) assessed the impact of trade policies
on the outward stocks of FDI of the EU using a model
based on the knowledge-capital theory of multina-
tional enterprises over the period 1995­2008. The
results showed that BITs in force had a significant
and positive impact on the outward FDI. Neumayer
and Spess (2005) found that larger the number of
BITs negotiated, better was the flow of FDI inflows
to the developing countries. The results of studies
focusing on developing countries are mixed. Busse,
Koniger, and Nunnemkamp (2008) showed that BITs
did promote FDI flows to developing countries and
that they could also substitute weak domestic insti-
tutions. Büthe and Milner (2004) hypothesized that
the greater the number of BITs to which a developing
country was a party, the more attractive it was as an
investment location. Pradhan (2011) traced the origin
and growth of outward FDI by emerging Chinese
and Indian multinationals and examined the loca-
tional determinants of such investments. He found
that while Chinese multinationals had preference for
hosts with locational proximity, small size, and high
natural resource endowments, Indian firms appeared
to choose countries with large size and those that
had a BIT with India irrespective of their physical
distance from India.
As is evident from the literature review, a number of
studies provide support for the formation of BITs and
their impact on FDI. However, as mentioned before,
BITs can have differing impact on different countries
depending on the stage of development, liberalization
policies, etc. The importance of India as an investment
destination has already been brought out earlier, and
therefore, an examination of the factors responsible for
this trend is warranted. In the light of this, we iden-
tify the determinants of India's FDI flows with a special
focus on the role of BITs. Table 3 presents a summary of
the literature on the impact of BITs on FDI.
DATA AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Weemploypaneldataregressiononanextendedgravity
model to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into
India with special focus on BITs. The basic gravity
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 279
model was proposed by Tinbergen (1962) to explain
international bilateral trade. In the literature, studies
examining bilateral trade and investment patterns
have intensively used this model. Foreign investment
caters largely to two distinct domains, namely, expan-
sion of market size (horizontal motives) and easing of
production processes using cheaper labour (vertical
motive). Carr, Markusen, and Maskus (2001) captured
the extended gravity model for investment explaining
both horizontal motivation and vertical dimensions of
FDI. We study the layout of the gravity model for FDI
capturing both horizontal and vertical aspects adapting
the knowledge-capital model (Carr, Markusen, &
Maskus, 2001). To encompass the horizontal dimen-
sion, the study uses the market size as an aggregate of
the GDP of both the trading economies. To examine the
vertical motives (or factor endowment), we calculate
the difference in the GDP per capita of both the trading
partners. So, we use the extended gravity-knowledge
capital model (also known as the CMM model) to
examine the determinants of FDI inflows.
Sample Period and Coverage
This study covers a period of 12 years from 2001 to 2012
to capture the impact of BITs on India's FDI inflows.
The countries covered are Japan, Italy, Singapore, Hong
Kong, Germany, France, Cyprus, the USA, the UK, the
UAE, Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands, Mauritius,
Luxembourg, and the Republic of Korea. In 2012, these
countries accounted for 92 per cent (approximately)1
of India's total FDI inflows and are even today the top
investing countries in India. However, all the economies
covered as a part of the sample do not have BITs with
India. Japan, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Singapore, and
the USA have no BIT negotiated with India till date,
and although an investment treaty was negotiated with
the UAE in 2013, it did not come into force. All the other
economies in the sample are treaty partners of India
and had treaties negotiated (and in force) before 2012
(see Table A1 for country-wise year of negotiation).

Data Sources
The data on India's FDI inflows from a trading partner
were obtained from the UNCTAD database (UNCTAD,
2014b). For independent variables, the GDP, the GDP
per capita, inflation (measured as consumer price
index), and the official exchange rate were taken
from the World Bank database. With respect to other
explanatory variables, political constraint index data
were collected from the Political Constraint Index
Dataset (POLCON) Macro Data Guide (NSD, 2011).
The data for BITs negotiated by India were gathered
from Investment Policy Hub, UNCTAD (n.d.). The data
for the distance between the capitals of both the coun-
tries were taken from CEPII (French Research Centre
for International Economics, 2013).
Model Specification
The majority of the empirical work on the gravity
model for investment have either used FDI flows
or FDI stock as a dependent variable. Since we are
using the panel data with different source coun-
tries, it would be more appropriate to use FDI flows
because the calculation of FDI stock would be heter-
ogeneous across countries (Globerman & Shapiro,
2002). Moreover, data for India's FDI stock from its
investing partners are available only for a very short
period (2010­2012). In view of the discussion, we use
FDI inflows as the dependent variable.
We use a double log model for panel data regres-
sion to analyse the determinants of FDI inflows
between India and its investing partner. As the data
figures for some of the years are zero, we follow the
protocol of expressing the dependent variable as
log(1 + FDI) in order to accommodate zero observa-
tions (Eichengreen & Irwin, 1995; Rajan, 2008; Stein
& Duade, 2007). The basic regression equation used
in the study is as follows:
ln(1 + FDI

In order to take care of the dynamics in the equation,
the study also incorporates lagged FDI as one of the
explanatory variables (Egger & Merlo, 2007; Mina,

written as

While some studies used the GDP per capita of the
host country to measure the market size (Anwar &
Nguyen, 2010; Chakrabarti, 2001), others considered
the sum of the GDP of both the investing partner
countries in order to capture the market size (Resmini
& Siedschlag, 2008). We take the sum of gross domestic
product of both the economies to capture the horizontal
or extended market size. The coverage of the vari-
able is similar to the variables examined by Park and
Park (2006) and Bae and Keum (2013). The variable
is expected to be positive in case the host economy
acts as an extended market for the home economy
attracting horizontal FDI.
The absolute difference between the GDP per capita of
the home and the host (India) countries captures the
vertical FDI drive. Jang (2011) captured the difference
between the GDP per capita of the home and the host
economies to measure the relative skill difference. The
inflow of FDI is not only affected by the wage struc-
ture of the manufacturing sector but is also directly
or indirectly magnified by the payment to be done to
the non-manufacturing (service sector) related regime;
therefore, the GDP per capita differential is incorpo-
rated as a measure of skill differential. The variable is
expected to be positive if India is able to attract FDI
due to relative factor endowment. The coefficient of the
variable would depend on the extent to which India is
able to encourage (discourage) the inward flow of FDI.
Distance between the home and the host explains
whether the geographical proximity between both the
countries is attracting FDI or not. In studies covering
trade as a dependent variable, distance is associated
with the transportation cost. However, in the case of
FDI as a dependent variable, the impact of distance
will vary depending upon the type of FDI (Egger,
2008; Kayam & Hisarciklilar, 2009). If the motive is
to achieve production efficiency (vertical FDI), then
lesser the distance more is the flow of investment. For
market expansion (horizontal FDI), larger distance will
promote investment in the destination economy. The
tendency to capture the market by enhancing trade
increases with lesser distance. Therefore, the impact
of the variable is ambiguous. In order to measure the
impact of cultural distance between the home and the
host countries, the study incorporates two more invar-
iant variables along with distance, namely, common
colonial linkage and common language.
Common colonial link (ComCol) is incorporated as a
dummy variable which takes the value 1 if both the econ-
omies share a colonial heritage, otherwise 0. Countries
with similar colonial links tend to have some historical
association which can positively affect FDI. Common
Language (LANG) has been included to examine whether
countries that share a linguistic proximity tend to be
better investing partners. The study incorporates the
variable as a dummy variable with value 1 in case both
the economies share a common language, otherwise 0.
Political constraints measure whether the political struc-
ture and the related policies of India support FDI
inflows to India. The study incorporates the POLCON
produced by Henisz (NSD, 2011), which measures the
political constraints by identifying the underlying polit-
ical structures and the measures that support credible
policy commitments. This dataset developed by Henisz
(NSD, 2011) contained 90 variables covering legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial offshoots of a government
set-up. The study used the index to measure whether
the Indian political structure and constraints were
supporting inflows in India. The impact of the variable
is ambiguous and depends upon the strength of the
political set-up. In order to capture the impact of the
population growth rate on FDI inflows, we incorporate
the population growth rate of the host country (India) and
study the impact of extension on the size of the market.
The variable measures the impact of the growth in the
physical size of the economy (market) on the invest-
ment inflows. An economy with growing physical size
generally indicates an extension of labour as well as
consumer market. Though some studies (e.g., Akin,
2009) had found population growth to not promote
FDI, we expect the variable to be significant and posi-
tive for a labour-intensive economy like India.
Financial openness of the host country is incorporated to
measure the impact of India's investment policies on
FDI inflows. The variable is calculated as the sum of
FDI inflows and FDI outflows as a percentage of the
GDP in the study. The variable is expected to have a
positive impact on India's FDI inflows.

The variable of our interest, BIT, is incorporated as a
dummy variable. The value of the variable is taken as
1 in case a BIT exists between India and the investing
countries in the given year; otherwise, it is 0. The vari-
able is used to capture the impact of BITs on India's FDI
inflows and is expected to have a positive sign.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Studies covering the panel data regression model
have intensively used the static model (fixed effects
or random effects) specifications. A fixed effects (FE)
model specification is incorporated in the studies where
the individual and/or time-specific effects are corre-
lated with the explanatory variable. Moreover, each
cross-sectional entity is recognized with some specific
attributes of its own. Baltagi (2001) referred the fixed
effects model to be suitable for specifications where the
study focuses on a specific set of entities (an individual,
a country or firms) and the inference is restricted to
the set of such entities. The random effects model is
more appropriate when inferences are based on enti-
ties (individuals) randomly drawn from a large sample.
Mundlak (1978) argued that the random effects model
assumed exogeneity for all explanatory variables with
the random individual effects, whereas the fixed effects
model allowed for endogeneity of all explanatory varia-
bles with individual effects. Therefore, it is basically the
selection of all or none of the regressors for endogeneity
and individual effects. The Hausman test is generally
applied to choose between random and fixed effect esti-
mations. The impact of the explanatory variables was
examined using both fixed effects as well as random
effects specifications. The results of the Hausman test
supported the use of fixed effects (Table A1). Therefore,
the results were analysed using fixed effects and results
for time invariant variables were captured from the
random effects specifications.
In order to account for the presence of endogeneity
emerging from a reverse causality association between
FDI flows and BIT (countries exchanging notable FDI
maytendtonegotiateBITandcountrieswithinvestment
treaties may experience higher flows of FDI), we also
employ dynamic panel regression, the GMM, proposed
by Arellano and Bond (1991) with one year lag along
with random/fixed effects specifications. Anwar and
Cooray (2015) also examined the explanatory variables
using the GMM along with panel fixed effects in order
to empirically estimate the impact of financial flows
on the per capita income of low- and middle-income-
group economies. In this study, the GMM model was
found suitable mainly due to the presence of heteroske-
dasticity and autocorrelation (Table A2). Moreover, the
time period (T) of the study was small and the number
of countries (N) examined was large. The GMM uses
the lag of a dependent variable as one of the explana-
tory variables in order to capture the impact of the one
year lag of FDI inflows on the dependent variable and
also to control the dynamics in the equation. But, the
GMM given by Arellano and Bond (1991) incorporated
fixed effect only because the model was fitted using
first differences, and the time invariant got omitted in
the equation with first differences. The inflow of FDI is
affected by the FDI flows in the previous year(s) and,
thus, may cast a significant and positive impact on the
FDI flow in the current year. We performed the Sargan
test to establish the validity of the instruments covered
in the study. Due to the presence of heteroskedasticity,
we had to reject the null hypothesis for the one-step
GMM under the Sargan test (Table A3). However, the
estimates for the one-step GMM are consistent and
significant as for the present study, T (time period) < N
(number of countries). The study also estimates the
explanatory variables using the two-step GMM model
(the Sargan test for the two-step GMM supports the use
of instruments for examining the explanatory varia-
bles) with one year lag.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The descriptive statistics of the variables have been
summarized in Table A4a. Before starting the regres-
sion, we check for multicollinearity among explanatory
variables (Table A4b). None of the explanatory varia-
bles are found to be highly correlated. The results of
the Sargan test for the two-step GMM are encouraging
and suggest that residuals of first differences are not
correlated with the instruments. The results for serial
correlation indicate that first-order serial correlation is
marginally significant at the 10 per cent level, but the
outcome for second-order serial correlation exhibits no
serial correlation for the error term.
The results for the model using random effects, fixed
effects, and GMM specifications for a period of 12 years
(2001­2012), capturing the determinants of India's FDI
inflows, are depicted in Table 4. The Hausman test
supports the use of fixed effects (Table 4). Therefore, the
results for fixed effects along with GMM specifications
are found to be more suitable for interpretation.

The sum of the GDP of both the economies is found
to be positive and significant indicating a pull towards
horizontal FDI inflows in India. With its large market
size, India is seen as a captive destination for market-
seeking FDI. The variable population growth (POPGR)
is found to be positive and significant (only for fixed
effects specifications), indicating that the expanding
economic market of India is supporting FDI. The differ-
ence between the GDP per capita of both the economies
shows a negative coefficient. This implies that India
as a host economy for vertical integration is not able
to attract enough FDI. A possible reason for this result
could be that labour cost differentials are not supported
by other factors which are instrumental in driving
investment decisions such as the quality of supporting
infrastructure and institutions. Further, differences
in wage levels may not be compensated for by differ-
ences in productivity which might contribute to a nega-
tive sign for the differential GDP per capita of both the
economies (Globerman & Shapiro, 2002).
The coefficients for all the three time invariant variables,
namely, distance, common language, and common colo-
nial links, are found to be insignificant using random
model specifications. The variable capturing political
constraints is found to be negative but insignificant. This
implies that an unstable political environment which is
not investor-friendly discourages FDI inflows to India,
though not significantly. The variable FDI openness
is found to be positive and significant, indicating that
India is able to attract more FDI with better and liberal
economic policies towards investment. The variable of
our interest, BIT, is found to be significant and positive,
implying that BITs are facilitating and promoting FDI
inflows to India. Thus, a developing economy like India
can capture and magnify the FDI inflows by entering
into investment associations with prospective investing
economies. BITs are providing a certain, predictable and
investor-friendly environment to multinational firms
contemplating investment in India, thereby positively
influencing their decision to invest here.

The lag of FDI is found to be positive and significant.
This indicates that previous years' investment trends, if
high, encourage investors to invest funds in subsequent
years. The lag of FDI is indicative of the existing invest-
ment environment in India for the current investment.
The results for the fixed effects and the GMM model
specifications are more or less similar. These results
confirm our expectations and reinforce the positive
role of BITs in facilitating foreign investment. For
developing countries like India, such treaties play an
important role in creating a conducive environment for
foreign investment.
CONCLUSION
IndiahasbeenattractinglargeamountsofFDIeversince
it liberalized in 1991. The liberalization regime has also
seen India become a part of the growing trend of nego-
tiating BITs with a number of its trade and investment
partners. This article sought to examine whether BITs
were achieving the intended objective of higher FDI
inflows to India. Using an augmented gravity model
and estimating both under static and dynamic condi-
tions, we find that BITs are playing their desired role
in attracting FDI inflows into India. They have contrib-
uted to rising FDI inflows by providing protection
and commitment to foreign investors contemplating
investment in India. The model also finds support
for other factors facilitating FDI such as the large size
of the economy and a more liberal FDI regime. As
attracting FDI is an important policy objective of devel-
oping countries like India, the results imply that one
of the instruments of achieving this objective is for the
government to negotiate BITs with countries that are
prospective investors. By laying down clear guidelines
with respect to investment and widening the scope of
investment activities covered under a bilateral agree-
ment, an environment of certainty is created which
would facilitate FDI flows.
