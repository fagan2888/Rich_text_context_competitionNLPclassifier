Abstract
In this article, we studied perception of a particular case of light fields that is characterized by a
difference in its consistent structure between parts of a scene. In architectural lighting design, such
a consistent structure in a part of a light field is called a light zone. First, we explored whether
human observers are sensitive to light zones, that is, zones determined primarily by light flow
differences, for a natural-looking scene. We found that observers were able to distinguish the light
conditions between the zones. The results suggested an effect of light zones' orientation.
Therefore, in Experiment 2, we systematically examined how the orientation of light zones
(left-right or front-back) with respect to a viewer influences light inferences in symmetric
scenes. We found that observers are quite sensitive to the difference in the light flow of the
light zones. In addition, we found that participants showed idiosyncratic behavior, especially for
front-back-oriented light zones. Our findings show that observers are sensitive to differences in
light field structure between two parts of a scene, which we call visual light zones.

Introduction
Can one make visual estimations of something that can not be seen? Yes, human observers
are sensitive to the light field in empty space (Koenderink, Pont, van Doorn, Kappers, &
Todd, 2007; Pont, 2009; Schirillo, 2013; Xia, Pont, & Heynderickx, 2014). They can visually
fit the intensity, direction, and diffuseness of light on a matte white sphere to a scene basing

on appearance of objects in that scene. This sensitivity was named the visual light field
(Koenderink et al., 2007). Moreover, observers can robustly estimate these light properties
throughout an empty space (Kartashova, Sekulovksi, de Ridder, te Pas, & Pont, 2016), and
their inferences agree with homogeneous, converging, or diverging superpatterns (van Doorn,
Koenderink, Todd, & Wagemans, 2012). The human ability to infer light in (empty!) space is
an interesting scientific topic in itself and also relates to questions about interdependency of
light, shape, and material perceptions. In this article, we further explore visual light fields
by investigating inferences on spatially varying superpatterns, created by variation in
illumination over scenes.
Light fields (Gershun, 1939; Mury, Pont, & Koenderink, 2007) in natural scenes can contain
uniform, convergent, divergent, rotational, and deformation patterns (Mury, 2009). A uniform
pattern is formed by perfectly collimated light (having parallel light rays), for example, direct
sunlight. Convergent and divergent patterns are formed by light that focuses in a point or
spreads out from a point, respectively. A rotational pattern is formed by light that cycles
around a point. Finally, a deformation pattern has a complex flow structure, for example, a
saddle. Van Doorn et al. (2012) showed that observers group local shading patterns into global
superpatterns that appear to be illuminated in some unitary fashion. They found that observers
can perceive uniform, convergent, and divergent patterns but that they are blind to rotational
and deformation patterns. The question we address here is whether observers are able to
perceive such global superpatterns if a single scene contains two of such patterns.
In the architecture field, such patterns or consistent structures within complex light fields
were named light zones by Madsen (2007). She introduced the concept of light zones,
provided several practical examples and defined them as ``(spatial) groupings of the
lighting variables (intensity, direction, distribution and colour), which are significant to the
space and form-giving characteristics of light.'' We note that light zones or the zone system
were also introduced in photography by Adams (1948); yet, those zones concern luminance
ranges of photographed scenes used for determining optimal film exposure. This is of course
closely related to lightness perception and spatial grouping on the basis of intensity, which
was already intensely studied (see later). We here study light zones in Madsen's (2007) sense
of spatially segmented parts of a scene that can be grouped on the basis of the structure of the
light flow, or, in van Doorn et al.'s words, ``global super-patterns that appear to
be illuminated in some unitary fashion.'' As van Doorn et al., we consider primarily
the directional properties of the light field structure, the light flow, for this segmentation.
Moreover, we restrict our light zones to flow structures that are uniform/divergent/
convergent. Please note that the superpatterns that van Doorn et al. studied were defined
in a plane but that they can be easily extrapolated to three-dimensional spaces especially for
these simple structures.
Although under different names, the concept of light zones can be found in a number of
perceptual studies. The first prominent example is Gilchrist's (1977) experiment on the
perceived lightness of a patch, which depended on its perceived position. Stimuli consisted
of two empty spaces, a dark one in the front and a bright one in the back, which were
connected with a door opening. When a patch was thought to be in the brightly lit back
space (one light zone), its matched lightness was much lower than when it appeared to be in
the dim front space (another light zone). Snyder, Doerschner, and Maloney (2005) changed
the apparent depth of a probe sphere by manipulating retinal disparity. The sphere could
appear to be placed either in a far bright room or in a close dark room, along the observer's
line of sight. Hence, retinal disparity moved the probe between different light zones. This
manipulation affected the perceived lightness of the probe. Schirillo (2013) discussed this and
2 i-Perception 9(3)
other examples in which the lightness and chromaticity of patches were judged in depth
planes with different illuminations. He concluded that human observers are able to infer
the light in empty space (between illuminated objects). This was tested and confirmed in
Koenderink et al.'s (2007) visual light field study. Toscani, Gegenfurtner, and Doerschner
(2017) studied the difference in perception of illumination in #thedress scene between
observers who see the dress white and gold and those who see it blue and black. The light
was probed in front of the dress and in the background. It was found that in the background,
there were no differences in chromaticity settings between different perceivers. However,
in the foreground, the white-perceivers made bluer settings than blue-perceivers, making
the chromatic difference between the front and back of the scene more pronounced.
The foreground and background in this case represent two zones with different
illuminations. The question remains whether observers are able to spatially segment parts
of a scene on the basis of the structure of the light flow, that is, the directional properties of
the light.
The study presented in this article was inspired by an experiment using 17th century Dutch
paintings (Kartashova, de Ridder, te Pas, Schoemaker, & Pont, 2015), results of which
showed a relation between settings consistency and the complexity of light fields in painted
scenes. In that experiment, we tested the perception of light on objects and in empty space.
Observers were asked to infer light either on volumetric objects cutouts from images of six
painted scenes, or in empty space in positions of those cutout objects in the scenes. The
consistency of observers' settings varied greatly between paintings. Four paintings contained
seemingly consistently structured light fields (uniform or diverging), or a single light zone.
For those paintings, the observers' settings were rather consistent between conditions
(comparing settings for the cutout object with those for the probe in the painting) and
within a scene. However, for the other two paintings, the observers' inferences varied
greatly. One of those paintings showed an interior and exterior through a window
opening, and the other an interior and back room through a door, thus, both paintings
seemed to present two spaces with different light qualities--including its directional
properties. The most likely explanation of the inconsistencies in the observers' settings was
the presence of two light zones in both paintings. The observers seemed to interpret the
border between the zones idiosyncratically; some inferred two different illuminations in
the two parts of the scene, while others made settings as if there was only one light zone.
It was an interesting finding; yet, we could not compare the settings of observers to the
veridical values in those scenes because they were painted hundreds of years ago.
Our goal in the current study is to investigate the perception of light properties in scenes
with two light (direction) zones. We performed two experiments. The first experiment (see
Experiment 1 section) had an explorative nature and was done to test whether we could
repeat the finding of our former study and to analyze how it is related to the physical light
field. We built a model of a natural scene and illuminated it with two configurations of light
sources, both creating two light zones. The two configurations were designed to have different
orientations with respect to the viewing direction. The visual light field was measured over a
grid of points, analyzed, visualized, and compared with the physical light field. In the second
experiment (see Experiment 2 section), we focused on the specific question whether the
orientation of the light zones (in the picture plane vs. in depth) influences the light
inferences. In Experiment 2, we used less probes per scene to allow probing more
illumination configurations, and we used a controlled environment. Finally, we discuss the
obtained results and propose further directions for research on light zones perception (see
Discussion and Conclusion section).
Kartashova et al. 3
Experiment 1
The aim of the first experiment was to investigate whether human observers are able to
distinguish differences in light properties between physical light zones that were designed
to have prominent differences in light directions. We created a scene with two illumination
conditions. One condition produced different light zones in the left and in the right part of the
scene; another condition created different light zones in the front and in the back parts of
the scene. We obtained visual light fields for both illumination conditions by sampling the
observers' light inferences over a grid of positions (for method, see Kartashova et al., 2016).
Methods
Stimuli. We created a model of a scene resembling a living room and illuminated it using two
sets of light sources (see Figure 1). In both illumination conditions, the light sources were
placed such that approximately half of the scene was in one light zone and approximately half
in another. The main difference between the light zones was the light direction. In the first
condition, the illumination direction differed between the left and right sides of the scene,
creating a left-right (LR) light zones condition. The left side of the scene was illuminated
from top-left, with the lamps on the ceiling of the room, and the right part from top-right
with the sun shining through the window. The second, front-back (FB) condition had the
front part illuminated from the top-front, via lamps above the viewer (not visible in
the image), and the back part was illuminated from the left with the light coming through
the door in the back of the room. The light of the lamps was simulated by small spherical
light sources producing diverging light. The sun- and skylight was simulated by small
luminous planes. We rendered images of 1,200 Ã 900 pixels size with the following settings:
linear gamma, mental ray renderer (built-in software for rendering of images and light
measurements), minimum 1 sample per pixel, maximum 128 samples per pixel.
Setup. To measure the visual light field in the scenes, we used a light probing approach
(Kartashova et al., 2016; Koenderink et al., 2007). During the actual measurements,
a white matte sphere on a black monopod was superimposed on an image of the scene.
Observers could control the direction of the light on the sphere via mouse movements and
the intensities of the directed and ambient lights using keyboard buttons. From the observers'

condition.

settings, we also extracted the diffuseness of the light, parameterized as 1 minus the ratio
between the directed and ambient intensities (Xia, Pont, & Heynderickx, 2016b). The
diffuseness can range from fully collimated light (e.g., sunlight) to fully diffuse or Ganzfeld
illumination (e.g., light in the mist on a snowy field).
To define the positions and sizes of the sphere and pole, we created a grid of spheres
standing on poles in the model, five spheres in width, five in depth, and three in height. The
grid was positioned in the scene such that for both illumination conditions, the vertical
middle planes of the grid were on the borders between the light zones (see Figures 2
and 4). The grid was also adjusted such that the poles were always standing on
nonoccluded objects to clearly define the spheres positions. For Figure 4, the probes were
rendered in the scenes.
For the experiment, we used a high-resolution 15-inch computer screen (2,880 Ã 1,800
pixels, Retina Display, luminance range from 0.4 cd/m2 to 330.8 cd/m2). The experiment
sequence and controls were developed using the Psychtoolbox library (Brainard, 1997;
Pelli, 1997). The light in the room was switched off to avoid illumination interference on
the screen. The viewing distance of the observers was fixed at 27 cm from the screen with a
chin rest to keep the viewing angle the same as that of the virtual camera used for rendering.
The images and probe were presented in grayscale because we wanted primarily to test the
influence of the distribution of light. The images, probe, and screen were calibrated linearly.
Procedure. At each trial of the experiment, observers were asked to set the illumination on the
probe to make it appear as if it belongs to the scene. The experiment consisted of two blocks
for the two conditions: LR and FB. Half of the observers started with the LR scene and half
with the FB scene to balance the order. In each condition, observers made one setting for
each grid position and two additional settings for probes corresponding to the red spheres
in Figure 2. Having three repetitions in these points allowed us to compare the spread of the
settings within observers across light zones and illumination conditions.
Before the experiment, we explained the procedure, task, and probe controls to the
observers. We did not explain the concept of light zones to the observers. To explain the
task, we showed a scene resembling a different room that was not used in the experiment,
with spheres rendered in it. Then, we performed three trials for training the use of the
controls, after which the two parts of the experiment were conducted.
Participants. Ten observers participated in this experiment. The participants were naive
with respect to the setup and purpose of this experiment. All participants had normal or

corrected-to-normal vision. They all gave written, informed consent. All experiments were
done in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, Dutch Law, local ethical guidelines, and
approved by the TUDelft Human Research Ethics Committee.
In-scene light measurements. In addition to the psychophysical measurements, we also
performed measurements of the light in the modeled scene. For this purpose, we used the
Lighting Analysis Assistant tool of the Autodesk 3ds Max system, which allows virtual
illuminance measuring. We created a grid of virtual cubic illuminance meters (six
illuminance meters on a cube, which allows to measure a first-order approximation to the
light field, see Xia, Pont, & Heynderickx, 2016a; Xia et al., 2016b) using a script. We set the
measurement cubes to be in the same positions as the probes. The script placed all six meters
in the same position, with the sensors facing the positive and negative directions of each
axis (see details in Kartashova, de Ridder, te Pas, & Pont, 2018). Then, for each cube,
we extracted from the resulting six luminance measurements the intensity, diffuseness, and
direction of the light using Cuttle's (2003, 2013) formulas and interpolated them to obtain a
representation of the mathematical first-order structure of the ``physical'' light field in the
scene (Kartashova et al., 2016). Alternative could be estimating the properties from for
instance local spherical panoramic images. They are easy to use in rendered scenes, yet
would require a spherical harmonics decomposition to compute the properties. Xia, Pont,
and Heynderickx (2016a, 2016b) showed that the cubic approach forms a computationally
easier approach. Moreover, it can easily be used in real scenes too.
We visualized the light fields as light tubes (see Figure 3). A tube is aligned to the light
vectors along its length. A tube's path is calculated via interpolation methods (see
Kartashova et al., 2016; Mury, Pont, & Koenderink, 2009 for the details). The thickness
of a tube is inversely proportional to the light intensity. The physical light field in the LR
condition contains curved tubes. This happens because in the middle of the measured volume,
there is a space that is occluded from all direct light sources, where light arrives mostly
through scattering from the floor. Therefore, it is dim (the tubes are rather thick), and the

light vector is directed downward (to the floor, a secondary light source). It is clear that the
light direction in the left side of the measured volume is very different from the middle and
the right side of the volume. There is less curvature in the light field topology for the FB
condition because there is almost no space occluded from the direct light sources. As a result,
there is a clear division between the light zones, one being in the volume of the light from the
door, and the other in the volume of the light from the lamps.
Results
From the observers' settings on the spheres, we obtained psychophysical measurements of the
direction, intensities (directed and ambient), and diffuseness of light in the two illumination
conditions. The diffuseness D was calculated in accordance to the following formulas (Cuttle,
2003, 2013; Kartashova et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016a, 2016b):

of Evector
and Esymmetric
, respectively, after correction for the clipping of intensities on the
probe. The diffuseness D ranges from 0 (fully collimated light) to 1 (fully diffuse light).
To analyze the results quantitatively, we grouped the settings according to the positions of
the probes. The grid was ``sliced'' into planes parallel to the border between the light zones
(see Figure 4). In the LR condition, the probes were grouped parallel to the viewing direction
and in the FB condition parallel to the picture plane. Thus, each of the five groups of data
points contained the directional settings of all observers (including the repetitions) on all
probes of a slice.
Figure 5 shows the distribution of the directional settings on spheres, with the mean
direction represented by a red dot and one standard deviation by red ellipses, for each
plane and both conditions. The ellipses' short and long axes were determined by projecting
the data on a plane and calculating standard deviations of the resulting bivariate
distributions. It is clear that the settings on the two left spheres in Figure 5 (left light zone
for LR, and back light zone for FB) are dramatically different from the settings on the two
right spheres (right light zone for LR, and front light zone for FB). The angular differences
between the means of the different light zones are large: from 82 to 111 for LR and from 49
to 61 for FB. In contrast, the differences for planes in the same light zones are small: 24 and
12 for LR, and 4 and 8 for FB. This suggests that observers were on average able to
distinguish the light zones. However, the data show quite some variation, and therefore we
now analyze individual results in detail.
Kartashova et al. 7
Having the observers' settings for a grid of points allowed us to reconstruct the visual light
fields via interpolation (Kartashova et al., 2016; Mury et al., 2009); see Figure 6 for three
representative cases per condition. Generally, in the LR condition, there is an apparent
distinction between the light zones with the border slightly varying from one observer to
another, but roughly in the middle of the measured volume (see Figure 6, top row). For none
of the observers, we found curved light tubes in the center of the scene, as in the physical light

observers on all the spheres of a corresponding slice. The red dots represent the mean directions; the red
ellipses represent one standard deviation.

direction, and right is the FB (front-back) condition sliced across the viewing direction.

field (see Figure 3). This confirms our previous finding that human observers ignore subtle
variations in physical light fields (Kartashova et al., 2016). The visual light fields in the FB
condition differed from one observer to another (see Figure 6, bottom row). In the left
visualization, the tubes in the back of the room seem to flow to the door, whereas the
tubes in the rest of the room point to the lamps in front; in the second figure, all the tubes
point to the lamps; and in the third, most of the tubes point to the door.
We analyzed the spreads of the data between and within observers (see Figure 7). As a
measure of the spread of the directional settings, we took the dispersion 1/R, where R was the
length of the vector summation of the settings represented as unit vectors divided by the
number of measurements (Leong & Carlile, 1998). R has the highest value (namely 1) when
all the vectors point in the same direction, it decreases with increasing spread, and it is
smallest (namely 0) for data that are uniformly spread over all directions. So, 1/R ranges
from 1 to infinity. The motivation of using such method is that the data have a spherical
nature, and therefore, such a spherical analysis is better suited than splitting the data into two
angles. For the interobserver spread of the directional settings, represented in the first column
and row of Figure 7, we calculated the dispersion 1/R for all settings of all observers on all
spheres of a slice, including the repetitions (thus, the same data as we grouped in Figure 5
for calculating means and ellipses). For the LR light condition (left half of the graph), the
dispersion peaks on the middle plane and otherwise is relatively low. The dispersions in the
FB condition (right half of the graph) seem more uniform across the slices than in the LR
condition and on average higher. We did not calculate the significance of the differences
between the data for the slices because we did not have a tool at hand for the analysis of
such spherical data. The dispersion between repetitions (within observers) was calculated
using the repeated settings data for five probes. The five probes were selected from the
nine repetition probes such that two of the probes lay in one light zone, two in the other

light zone, and one in the center of the grid. The dispersions between repetitions showed a
similar pattern as those between observers. Moreover, the values of 1/R between repetitions
or within observers seemed, overall, somewhat smaller than between observers.
To compare the intensity settings, we calculated the scalar illuminance (see Equation 5).
For diffuseness, we used the normalized diffuseness formula of Xia (Cuttle, 2003; Xia et al.,
2016a; see Equation 6). We took the standard deviation as a measure of the spread of the
intensity and diffuseness (see Figure 7). We found that the spreads for the intensities (ranging
from 0 to 1) are always between 0.07 and 0.12 and for the diffuseness (ranging from 0 to 1)
between 0.10 and 0.25, and we did not find significant differences for these data. Moreover,
again the values between repetitions or within observers seemed overall somewhat smaller
than between observers.
Summarizing the results, the observers were able to distinguish the illumination differences
between the light zones. In addition, we found trends in the data, indicating that there might
be idiosyncratic differences as well as differences between the light conditions: In the LR
condition, the results seemed to be consistent, except the plane between the light zones,
whereas in the FB condition, the spread values seemed on average higher than in the LR
condition. The question remains whether these differences between the conditions were
genuine or that they were evoked by other stimulus properties. The positions of light
sources were different between the conditions, with respect to the scene geometry.
Specifically, in the LR condition, the light sources were on two opposite sides of the scene,
and in the FB condition on two perpendicular sides. In addition, in the LR condition, the
observers could see the lamps and not in the FB condition. Finally, the scene was not
symmetric.

settings, and the third column in the diffuseness settings. For the bar charts between observers, each bar

repetitions, each bar represents an average of the spreads between observers' repetitions for each probe.

We performed a second experiment to study if the trends in the findings were indeed
caused by the light zones' orientations. In Experiment 2, we eliminated all the listed
interfering differences between conditions.
Experiment 2
The goal of this experiment was to systematically investigate light perception for LR and FB
orientations of light zones. A rotationally symmetric scene was illuminated with three
configurations of light sources, creating physical light zones. Viewing each illumination
condition from two perpendicular directions allowed us to test LR and FB orientations of
the light zones while keeping the actual light and geometry in the scene constant.
Methods
Stimuli. The constructed scene contained a set of simple shapes that were placed and adjusted
such that the scene was geometrically symmetric with respect to 90 rotations (see Figures 8
and 9). The objects of the scene were chosen to induce a variety of light cues: shading,
shadows, highlights, and interreflections. All objects were white, and most of the objects,
except four spinners, were matte. The spinners were glossy. The ground plane was midgray,
and the background was black. The scene was created and rendered in the same software as
in Experiment 1.
For each illumination condition, the light sources were positioned at a 45 elevation with
respect to the center of the scene and the ground plane. For the first three conditions, we
illuminated the scene with two identical small spherical light sources (see Figures 8 and 9).
The conditions were viewed from two directions, such that from one viewpoint the light zones
were on the left and on the right side of the scene (1LR, 2LR, and 3LR), and from the other
viewpoint in the front and in the back of the scene (1FB, 2FB, and 3FB). We modulated the
positions of the light sources and shades to create light zones differing in average light
direction. Conditions 1 and 2 both have identical positions of the light sources at opposite
sides of the scene (see Figure 8, first row). In Condition 1, the shades partially occluded the
light so that the light source illuminated only the closer half of the scene. In Condition 2, the
shades completely occluded the light on half of the scene. The placing and orientation of
shades in these two conditions create light zones with complementary directions. As a result,
in 1LR, the scene is illuminated from the left and the right (similarly to LR condition of
Experiment 1), whereas in 2LR from the front and back. Condition 3 was selected to test a
condition that is similar to the FB condition of Experiment 1. In this condition, we used the
combination of the shades used in Conditions 1 and 2. The fourth condition contained a
single light source, identical to the sources of previous conditions, creating a quite
homogeneous single light zone. This single light zone condition was created to have
baseline settings for each light direction. It was viewed from each side of the scene (front,
right, back, and left). Thus, altogether, we created 10 test images, 6 with two light zones and
4 with a single light zone (see Figure 9).
Setup and procedure. The setup in Experiment 2 was the same as in Experiment 1. Each test
image contained five probes, one in each quadrant of the scene and one in the center
(see Figure 10)--but during the experiment, only one probe was shown per trial. Five
probes do not suffice to model the global light field but allowed us to include more
scenes in the experiment and systematically test the effects of light directions and viewing
directions. The adjustments were repeated three times for each probe and each test image.
Kartashova et al. 11
Thus, 10 test images Ã 5 probes Ã 3 repetitions constituted 150 trials, of which we randomized
the order of presentation.
Before the experiment, we explained the procedure, task, and probe controls to the
observers. We did not explain the concept light zones to the observers. To explain the
task, we showed two illuminations of the scene, which were not used in the experiment,
with spheres rendered in it. Then, we performed three trials for training the use of the
controls and the experiment trials.

As in Experiment 1, we also conducted ``physical'' light measurements in the scene at the
positions of the probes for each illumination condition.
Participants. Ten observers (different observers than who participated in Experiment 1)
participated in this experiment. The participants were naive with respect to the setup and
purpose of this experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They
all gave written, informed consent. All experiments were done in agreement with the
Declaration of Helsinki, Dutch Law, local ethical guidelines, and approved by the
TUDelft Human Research Ethics Committee.
Results
The results of Experiment 2 consisted of observers' repeated settings on the five probes for the
10 test images, 6 of which were pairs of light zones conditions, and the remaining 4
considered the single light source condition. We made several comparisons of the results
for the direction settings. We arranged the results for each test image in three groups, with
the first group representing the settings on the two probes of the first light zone (L for LR and
F for FB), the second group of the single middle probe, and the third group of the two probes
Figure 9. Test images. The first two rows contain the conditions with two light zones. The first row shows
the LR orientations, the second row the FB orientations. The third row shows the single light zone condition
from the left, front, and back (the right is not shown here because that is exactly mirrored to the left case).

of the second light zone (R for LR and B for FB). For the single light source condition, the
data were grouped into left, middle probe, and right parts of the scene with regard to the
viewing direction.
We parameterized the directional variability via the dispersion 1/R as described in
Experiment 1. Figure 11 shows that the dispersions are overall quite low and that they are
significantly lower between repetitions than between observers (paired t test: t Â¼ 3.04,
p Â¼ .002 < .05). There are clear peaks for the B zones of 1FB and 2FB, both between
observers and between repetitions. The peaks are even higher than on the middle sphere,
where high dispersion could be expected because this probe is on the border between the light
zones.

illuminations). Each scene contained five probes, four in each quadrant of the scene and one in the center of
the scene. Only one probe was shown at a time. A probe did not produce a shadow in the trials.

For comparison with the physical light directions for each probe, we calculated the mean
angular differences between the veridical and the observers' inferred light directions. These
deviations from veridical again showed peaks for the B zones of 1FB and 2FB. We tested if
deviations from the veridical values for back light zones are significantly different from
deviations from the veridical values for front light zones. We made paired t tests of these
groups for 1FB and 2FB. The differences are significant (1FB: t Â¼ Ã 4.91, p Â¼ 2.4 Ã 10Ã6; 2FB:
t Â¼ 4.46, p Â¼ .000013). The large deviation from veridical that we find for the middle sphere of
Condition 1 (middle bar of 1LR and 1FB in the Figure 12) is due to the physical light
direction being from below (light vector pointing down), while the observers inferred it to
be from above.
We also analyzed the distributions of the directional settings. Because all the light sources
were positioned on the same height (specifically, making a 45 angle between light source,
middle of the scene and the scene floor plane), the differences in their positions could be
specified in the XY-plane/a top view. Figure 13 shows the circular histograms of the settings
for the data of all test images, with the data grouped in three clusters as above. The red lines
in the centers of the circles show the veridical light directions (red dots instead of lines mean
that the veridical light vector points straight up or straight down). First, it is evident that the
majority of the settings are close to the veridical directions. Thus, observers were well able to
distinguish the light zones. If we take a closer look, we can see that for the back light zone of
1FB and 2FB, there is a number of settings in the direction opposite to the veridical, whereas
this is not the case for the LR conditions. It appears from the plots that observers often made
settings on the probe in the back light zone opposite to the actual illumination in that light
zone, but in accordance to the illumination in the front light zone. In addition, for these
images, the middle probe settings appear the same as those of the front probe, which is not
the case for the LR conditions.
As we explained in the Methods section, the two test images of the same light condition
differed only in the direction of view. Thus, if the settings would depend only on light
condition and not on viewing direction, the settings for the LR and FB cases should
be the same up to a 90 rotation. For example, the settings in the L light zone of 1LR
should be the same as in the F light zone of 1FB, after a 90 correction. We tested the
significance of the differences between pairs of directional settings (top view, as presented
in Figure 13) after 90 corrections. To this aim, we used Watson's U2 test (code by Me

[https://github.com/pierremegevand/watsons_u2] based on equations by Zar, 1999) for
circular distributions. First, we compared the settings between the couples of light zones
under the same illumination (see Table 1). For example, L of 1LR versus F of 1FB, and
L of 2LR versus B of 2FB. We found (see Table 1) that the front light zones of all FB
conditions were not significantly different from the corresponding zones of the
LR conditions, except for light Condition 2. However, the back light zones of all FB
conditions were significantly different from the corresponding zones of the LR conditions.
For the single light source condition, the settings were compared for the pairs 4L versus
4R and 4F versus 4B. We compared the pairs after flipping. The settings of 4L did not differ
significantly from the (mirrored) settings of 4R. There was a significant difference between
settings 4F and (mirrored) settings for 4B.
Figure 13. Top view circular histograms of direction settings. Settings are grouped such that the left
histogram of a test image shows the settings made on the two probes in the left or front light zone (for LR or
FB, respectively), the middle histogram shows the settings on the middle sphere, and the right histogram
shows the settings made on the two probes in the right or back light zone (for LR or FB, respectively). The
red lines in the centers of the circles show the veridical light directions (red dots instead of lines mean that
veridical light vector points straight up or straight down). The green line represents the picture plane.

Discussion and Conclusion
We investigated whether human observers can distinguish light zones that are determined by
a difference in overall light direction. In the first experiment, we measured and analyzed
visual light fields for two illumination conditions. In the second experiment, we created
highly controlled stimuli to systematically investigate the influence of light zones'
orientations. Specifically, we tested illumination perception in LR and FB orientations of
light zones.
The distributions, spreads, and visualizations of the first experiment's settings show that
observers were able to distinguish the illumination differences between the light zones. This
sensitivity we call visual light zones. There seemed to be a trend, suggesting that interobserver
spreads were larger than intraobserver spreads, especially for the FB condition. The results of
the second experiment confirmed the existence of visual light zones. In Experiment 2, we
again found that interobserver spreads were larger than intraobserver spreads, indicating
idiosyncratic behavior. In addition, we found a difference between LR and FB orientations
of light zones. In particular, the observers often made the settings in the back light zone of the
FB conditions in accordance to the illumination in the front light zone of those conditions.
One of the reasons of the differences in the settings between the light zones' orientations
might be the visibility of light cues, for example, shadows, shading, and highlights (Boyaci,
Doerschner, & Maloney, 2006; Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, te Pas, & Pont, 2003;
Lopez-Moreno, Sundstedt, Sangorrin, & Gutierrez, 2010; O'Shea, Agrawala, & Banks,
2010; Pas, Pont, Dalmaijer, & Hooge, 2017; Ripamonti et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2014, 2017).
In the LR orientation, each light zone took half of the picture plane, and therefore, it was
likely that in both light zones, the cues were approximately equally well visible. In the FB
condition, light cues in the back part might be less obvious than those in the front because of
occlusions and perspective/scaling. Boyaci et al. (2006) and Xia et al. (2017) demonstrated
how in the presence of less (articulated) cues the veridicality of participants' settings declined.
There are still many unanswered questions about light zones. One of the concerns is how
the grouping of such patterns happens. Illuminance flow patterns (Pont, van Doorn, Wijntjes,
& Koenderink, 2015) are a probable candidate as a cue for direction-based zones. The exact
mechanisms are subject of further studies. In addition, it needs to be studied how intensity,
direction, diffuseness, and color interact in the perception of light zones. Furthermore,
grouping light zones can be done at different scales of analysis. This scale (the dimensions
of the light zones with respect to the scene) determines the relative size and the number of
light zones in natural (usually complex) light fields. It defines, for instance, whether relatively
small parts of a scene are determined to be a separate light zone or part of a larger one. In
Koenderink et al.'s (2007) visual light field study, we find an interesting example. They tested
a position in their spotlight condition where the probe was in a relatively small shadow

volume that was cast by one of the objects (penguins). Only one of eight observers inferred
the probe to be in the shadow, but others adjusted the illumination on the probe as if it was in
the spotlight. It might well be the case that visual light zones concern a rather coarse-scale
analysis that neglects such fine-scale light variations. Further studies are needed to fully
understand these mechanisms.
Our findings might help to understand the structure of the visual light field, which can
contribute to several applied areas. In computer graphics, volume zoning was introduced for
the case of participating media, for example, dust or fog (Rushmeier & Torrance, 1987). We
believe that research on light zones could be useful for automated creation of light probes
(Chajdas, Weis, & Westermann, 2011). It would be also interesting to test the veridicality of
perception of light on objects moving through light zones, extending the existing studies of
lightness estimations of an object moving though differently illuminated areas (Toscani,
Zdravkovic
Â´ , & Gegenfurtner, 2016; Zdravkovic
Â´ , 2008). Would observers notice it if a
change of illumination on a moving object does not match the variations of the light in a
space through which it is moving? How (in)sensitive are we to such changes? Can we simplify
implementations by modeling complex natural light fields in a segmented model containing
only a few zones with simple uniform/divergent/convergent light flows? Light zones are
regularly used in architecture and light design. Madsen (2007) coined the concept and
provided a number of practical architectural examples. There is a continuing interest in
the topic from researchers in the field of architecture and lighting (Lindh, 2013; Trisha &
Imran, 2014). We sharpened the definition of light zones and provided an approach for
measuring and evaluating their perception. Finally, our results confirmed the existence of
visual light zones.
