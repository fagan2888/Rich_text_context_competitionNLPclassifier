Introduction
Due to the remarkable advances in the research and treat-
ment of cancer in children and adolescents, about 80%
patients reach long-term remissions today (Koutecký,
Kabícková, & Starý, 2002; Ries et al., 2007), as compared
with less than 30% of childhood cancer survivors in 1960s.
Therefore, late effects of anticancer therapy and related qual-
ity of life of survivors came into focus of clinicians (Oeffinger
& Robinson, 2007). Two thirds of childhood cancer survi-
vors suffer from at least one chronic health problem, approx-
imately half of which are serious or even life-threatening
(Geenen et al., 2007; Hudson et al., 2009; Mladosievicová,
Kaiserová, & Foltinová, 2007; Oeffinger et al., 2006). Only
one third of survivors have no health problems.
Specific types of late effects on somatic health include
physical damage (limb amputation, permanent alopecia),
restriction of physical functions due to conservational sur-
geries (resection of affected bones and homograft replace-
ments), chronic organ dysfunctions (heart, intestines, liver,
kidneys, and urinary bladder), diseases occurring in adult age
(cardiovascular problems and diabetes), impaired growth
and other disorders of endocrine functions (particularly after
radiotherapy [RT] of neurocranium or bone marrow trans-
plantation), neurological disorders (pareses, plegias, poly-
neuropathies), dysfunctions of sensory organs (hearing loss,
partial or complete loss of sight), and infertility. Extremely
unfavorable effects of oncological treatment include second-
ary malignities. According to certain authors, the overall risk
of incidence of these tumors in survivors is 2%, but in some
specific types of malignities, it can be much higher (25%-
30%; Mahajan & Jenney, 2004; Vlcková, 2011).
The most severe psychosocial effects of therapy include
disorders of neurocognitive functions. Most often, the follow-
ing areas are studied in association with anticancer therapy

on the Relationship Between Severity of
Late Effects of Anticancer Therapy and
Perceived Quality of Life of Childhood
Cancer Survivors

Abstract
The present study aims to investigate the relationship between severity of late effects and subjective quality of life of
childhood cancer survivors in different age brackets. The sample consisted of 147 cancer survivors (70 boys and 77 girls)
aged 8 to 18 who were in remission 2 to 5 years. The analyses were carried out separately for younger (8-12 years) and
older (13-19 years) age groups. Cancer survivors were asked to complete Minnesota­Minneapolis Quality of Life Instrument
(MMQL) as well as other methods of measuring involvement in everyday life activities and parent­child interactions Social
And Health Assessment (SAHA) were used. Severity of late effects was assessed on a 4-point scale in accordance with
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. While severity of late effects correlated positively only with parental
warmth in younger age bracket, there were many relationships between severity of late effects and quality of life in older age
bracket. The difference between the two age brackets is explained by the fact that adolescents are able to assess the impact
of the disease.

(radiotherapy and chemotherapy): verbal competences, ver-
bal learning and memory, information processing speed,
visual memory, spatial and psychomotor coordination, atten-
tion span and concentration, executive functions (Kepák
et al., 2007). Learning difficulties and problems with memory
and concentration can be also a consequence of absence from
the school (Eiser et al., 2007). Cognitive difficulties tend to
intensify with the lapse of time after treatment. Other serious
consequences include social difficulties and problems form-
ing close/intimate relations. The impaired social functioning
may cause more distress than physical effects of the illness
(Zebrack et al., 2004).About 12% of cancer survivors develop
posttraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD;Langeveld,Grootenhuis,
Voute, & de Haan, 2004). In the long term, childhood cancer
survivors may also have problems finding employment. The
contributing factors include cognitive impairments and poor
school performance, physical limitations, suboptimal social
skills, and preconceptions on the part of some employers.
Cancer survivors live with uncertainty over their future
health, and worry about possible relapse of the disease and
secondary tumors and about the limitations presented by late
effects. They have to come to terms with a compromise in
their physical and social functioning.
Quality of lives of cancer survivors is influenced not only
by the presence and number of late effects of therapy but also
by their severity. Studies on the relationship between sever-
ity of late effects and perceived quality of life are rather
scarce and, what is more, they provide ambiguous results.
For instance, Benesch et al. (2009) observed in survivors of
medulloblastoma/ependymoma (median of time after ther-
apy 56 months, range = 1-174) significant negative correla-
tion only between neurological late effects and scores of
Children Quality of Life Questionnaire KINDL. Meeske,
Patel, Palmer, Nelson, and Parow (2007) studied 86 survi-
vors aged 8 to 18 years (average time after therapy 7.8 years)
and found out that fatigue and severe effects of therapy were
associated with impaired physical functioning. On the con-
trary, Löf, Winiarski, Giesecke, Ljungman, and Forinder
(2009) observed in 53 adult survivors of childhood SCT
(stem cell transplantation) that adverse effects had none or
limited impact on their health-related quality of life
(HRQoL).
The relationship between severity of late effects of anti-
cancer therapy and perceived quality of life are however
affected also by other factors such as type of diagnosis,
tumor localization, type of therapy, age at the time of ther-
apy, time of therapy termination, and age of respondents at
the time of completion of questionnaires (Skinner, Wallace,
& Levitt, 2007). For instance, infertility significantly
decreases perceived quality of life in adolescence and young
adulthood, but not in childhood, as children usually cannot
understand the consequences. Similarly, infertility does not
have to influence quality of life of older adults who had
already come to terms with it.Age of respondents can explain
weak or no correlation between severity of effects and
perceived quality of life reported by Löf et al. (2009), who
performed a study with adult survivors.
The present study analyzes the relationships between
severity of late effects of anticancer therapy and perceived
quality of life in two brackets: children aged 8 to 12 years
and adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. It was assumed that
severity of late effects in children would be compensated by
good physical functioning--as physical activities are
extremely important for them (Langmeier, Langmeier, &
Krejcíová, 1998)--and overall outlook on life. The assump-
tion in adolescents was that, in addition to previously dem-
onstrated relationship between severity of late effects and
decreased physical functioning (Meeske et al., 2007) and
cognitive functioning (Kepák et al., 2007), there would be
negative correlation between severity of late effects and
involvement in social relations and leisure time activities,
forming intimate relations and body image, as these aspects
of life are very important in adolescence (Brown & Larson,
2009; Connolly & McIsaac, 2009). The influence of severity
of late effects on overall outlook on life was expected also in
adolescents.
Method
Sample
The study sample consisted of 52 anticancer therapy survi-
vors aged 8 to 12 years (M = 10.17, SD = 1.23; 29 girls, 23
boys) and 95 anticancer therapy survivors aged 13 to 19 let
(M = 15.95, SD = 1.88; 48 girls, 47 boys). At the time of
inquiry, younger respondents were in remission for 20 to 118
months (median = 37 months), having been diagnosed to
have central nervous system (CNS) tumor (12 persons), leu-
kemia (22 persons), and solid extracranial tumors (18 per-
sons). Older respondents were in remission for 8 to 140
months (median = 40 months), having been diagnosed to suf-
fer from CNS tumor (20 persons), leukemia (10 persons),
and solid extracranial tumors (65 persons).
Instruments
Involvement in leisure time activities was measured by the
Conventional Involvement scale taken from SAHA (Social
and Health Assessment) questionnaire (Schwab-Stone et al.,
1999; Weissberg et al., 1991). Children indicate frequency of
individual activities on a 5-point scale ("How often in the
week . . .? 0x, 1x, 2x-3x, 4x-5x, 6x-7x; scale range = 0-4).
Total involvement in afterschool and leisure activities is
expressed as the mean score.
Interactions between parents and children (parenting
aspects) were measured using the Parent­Child Interactions
Scale, again from SAHA questionnaire, that determines four
aspects of parenting--parental involvement (Cronbach's  =
.598), parental warmth (Cronbach's  = .649), parental con-
trol (Cronbach's  = .705) and inconsistency of parenting
Blatný et al. 3
(Cronbach's  = .560. Children assess parents' behavior on a
4-point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often; 1-4). Level of
individual parenting aspects is again expressed as the mean
score.
Other domains of QoL were assessed using the
Minneapolis­Manchester Quality of Life Instrument (Bhatia
et al., 2002; Bhatia et al., 2004) that was designed specially
for children who underwent anticancer treatment. The ques-
tionnaire has two forms, the youth form (8-12 years) and the
adolescent form (13-20 years).
The youth form includes the following domains of QoL:
physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, Cronbach's  = .667,
range of scale = 1-4), physical functioning (e.g., have a lot of
energy, Cronbach's  = .761, range of scale = 1-4), psycho-
logical functioning (e.g., feeling sad, Cronbach's  = .620,
range of scale = 1-5) and outlook on life (e.g., happy with the
way things are, Cronbach's  = .782, range of scale = 1-4).
The adolescent form evaluates the following domains of
QoL(range of scales = 1-5): physical functioning (Cronbach's
 = .802), cognitive functioning (Cronbach's  = .812), psy-
chological functioning (Cronbach's  = .665), social func-
tioning (Cronbach's  = .856), intimate relations (Cronbach's
 = .736), body image (Cronbach's  = .831) and outlook on
life (life satisfaction, Cronbach's  = .843).
Severity of effects was measured using a 4-point scale
(0 = none, 1 = less severe, 2 = moderately severe, 3 = highly
severe). Late effects were assessed by a physician on the date
of investigation using appropriate medical records. Individual
late effects and their combinations were evaluated in accor-
dance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events v3.01 (CTCAE). The resulting degree of severity was
established according to the most severe late effect recorded.
Methods of Analysis
The relationship between late effects of anticancer therapy
and perceived quality of life was assessed by correlation
analysis: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used
due to ordinal nature of variable reflecting the severity of
effects.
Results
Descriptive data about severity of late effects of therapy in
dependence on patient's age and type of diagnosis are stated
in Table 1.
Table 1 demonstrates that overall severity of effects was
slightly lower in children aged 8 to 12 years than in adoles-
cents aged 13 to 19 years. This may be influenced by higher
incidence of extracranial solid tumors and lower incidence of
leukemia in adolescents as compared with younger respon-
dents (Tables 2 and 3).

In children, severity of late effects of therapy is correlated
only with perceived parental warmth. Physical functioning,
psychological (emotional) functioning, and overall outlook
on life decrease with higher severity of late effects; this rela-
tionship however is not statistically significant. In adoles-
cents, severity of late effects of therapy is associated with
many aspects of perceived quality of life. Severity of late
effects correlates negatively with cognitive functioning,
physical and social functioning, and body image. Overall
outlook on life and satisfaction with intimate relations
decreases in adolescents with higher severity of late effect of
therapy. Nevertheless, these relationships were not statisti-
cally significant.
Discussion
The incidence of late effects of anticancer therapy observed
in the present study sample corresponds with many studies
that identified certain late effect in up to 70% survivors (e.g.,
Blaauwbroek et al., 2007; Lackner et al., 2000). It was also
proved that the most severe late effects are found in survivors
of CNS tumors, whereas the least severe effects are seen in
patients with history of leukemia.
It was assumed that severity of late effects of therapy in
various age categories would correlate with different aspects
of perceived quality of life. However, only a part of this
hypothesis was confirmed. As expected, more relationships
between severity of late effects and perceived quality of life
were observed in adolescents. Although the anticipated rela-
tionships were found in younger bracket as well, they were
not statistically significant--this was namely the relationship
between severity of late effects and decreased physical and
psychological functioning and pessimistic outlook on life.
The only statistically significant relationship between
severity of late effects of therapy and perceived quality of
life in children was the correlation between severity of late
effects and parental warmth: The severer the effects, the
more the parental warmth. This relationship could explain
the absence of other statistically significant correlations
between perceived quality of life and severity of late effects
of therapy: Parental warmth can compensate for children's
handicaps resulting from the consequences of therapy.
In fact, more relationships between late effects severity
and perceived quality of life were found in adolescents. This
might be due to the fact, that they took an adult attitude about
their disease, were fully aware of its effects, and could antici-
pate future consequences. In accordance with other authors,
the present study indicated that severity of late effects
reduced perceived quality of life in the area of physical and
cognitive functioning (Meeske et al., 2007; Mulhern et al.,
2004). The results of this study suggest that severity of
effects negatively influences also involvement in leisure
time activities, social functioning, and body image. This is
perhaps because adolescents (aged 13-19 years; 15.95 years
on average) consider physical appearance and conventional
involvement as key domains of their lives (Lerner &
Steinberg, 2009). Moreover, adolescents showed negative
relationships between severity of late effects and outlook on
life and satisfaction with intimate relations. These relation-
ships were however statistically insignificant.
The results of the present study confirm the hypothesis
that severity of late effects of anticancer therapy should be
studied in relation to not only specific diagnosis, tumor
localization, type of therapy, and age of patients at the time
of therapy but also age of respondents at the time of inquiry.
Actually, criteria of perceived quality life as well as domains
that are most affected by the consequences of anticancer
therapy can change with time.
Limitations
This study has typical limitations of inquiries based on self-
report data. However, as it studies quality of life, it has to
work with such data. This study is also limited by uneven
distribution of diagnoses in the sample, as adolescent survi-
vors of CNS tumors and leukemia are not represented suffi-
ciently. Hence, possible interaction between severity of
therapy effects and the type of diagnosis and their overall
impact on perceived quality of life could not be analyzed.
