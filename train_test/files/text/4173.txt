Abstract
Objective: To explore stable and functional microRNA (miRNA)­disease relationships using a
genome-wide expression profile pattern matching strategy.
Methods: We applied the ranked microarray pattern matching strategy Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis to identify miRNA permutations with similar expression patterns to diseases. We also
used quantitative reverse transcription PCR to validate the predicted expression levels of miRNAs
in three diseases: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), oesophageal cancer, and colorectal cancer.
Results: We found that hsa-miR-200 c was upregulated more than 40-fold in oesophageal cancer.
The expression of miR-16 and miR-124 was not consistently upregulated in IBD or colorectal
cancer.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that this expression profile matching strategy can be used to
identify functional miRNA­disease relationships.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-
stranded small noncoding RNAs ($22
nucleotides long) that negatively regulate
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression at the
post-transcriptional level.1,2 miRNAs bind

to the 30-untranslated region of target genes
through base-pairing, resulting in mRNA
degradation and/or translational inhib-
ition.3 Accumulating evidence shows that
miRNAs are involved in multiple biological
processes and cellular signalling path-
ways,4,5 and that mutations or the dysregu-
lation of miRNAs can cause various
diseases. Recently, several studies have
identified close relationships between
miRNAs and disease,4,6­9 leading to the
construction of dozens of miRNA-related
databases. For example, miR2Disease, a
resource of miRNAs that are dysregulated
in human diseases, currently includes 3273
miRNA­disease relationship entries.10
A common strategy to explore potential
disease-related miRNAs is to identify
miRNAs that are differentially expressed in
a disease state using technologies such as
quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-
PCR, miRNA microarray analysis, or
small RNA deep sequencing. Alternatively,
cell transcriptional responses to various
treatments or perturbations can be com-
pared using algorithms such as Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)11 and large
gene expression profiling datasets to quan-
titatively calculate the relevance of different
perturbations. The first large-scale effort to
apply this principle was the Connectivity
Map project, which aimed to find potential
connections among molecule treatments,
disease states, and other bioprocesses by
querying large-scale expression profiling
data and validated gene sets.12 Since then,
several studies have also demonstrated the
feasibility of this approach in drug repos-
ition studies.13­15
Hypothetically, because miRNAs are
integrated into regulatory networks that
influence target and other downstream
genes, cell transcriptional responses against
miRNA perturbations (either overexpres-
sion or knockdown) may reflect the tran-
scriptional response of the related disease
state to some extent. Thus, miRNA­disease
relationships can be identified using this
transcriptional response comparison strat-
egy. Previously, Jiang et al. suggested that it
might be possible to determine miRNA­
drug links by integrating miRNA targets
with the expression profiles of cancers
and cell responses to small molecules.16
However, to the best of our knowledge, no
investigation has directly compared the
transcriptional responses induced by both
miRNA genotype variation and disease.
Recently, our group developed the
ExpTreeDB database, which allows users
to mine relationships among manually
curated perturbations such as agent treat-
ment, genotype variation, disease state,
stress, and infection.17 In this study, we
explored miRNA­disease relationships
using this methodology and datasets from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We
collected global transcriptional response
datasets representing 40 human diseases
and 30 miRNA variation treatments. Pair-
wise similarities were calculated to identify
putative miRNA­disease links for a litera-
ture investigation and experimental valid-
ation in three diseases: inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), oesophageal cancer, and
colorectal cancer. We found that miR-200 c
was significantly overexpressed in oesopha-
geal cancer. However, we did not observe
the consistently upregulated expression of
miR-16 or miR-124 in IBD or colorectal
cancer.
Methods
Specimens
Subjects in this study were recruited by
Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, and
included five oesophageal cancer patients
(four men and one woman; average age,
67 years), five colorectal cancer patients
(three men and two women; average age, 62
years), and five IBD patients (two Crohn's
disease cases and three ulcerative colitis cases;
four women and one man; average age,
Ni et al. 597
38 years). The diagnosis of all patients had
been confirmed by pathology. Patients with
cancer were free of other malignant neo-
plasms, and had not undergone radiother-
apy or chemotherapy.
This work was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People's
Hospital (approval number: 2014KY059).
Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects prior to their participation.
Two 1Â1 cm tissue samples and the 5 cm
margin of each carcinoma sample were
obtained during surgical resection. All sam-
ples were washed with saline solution then
immediately placed into 2 ml RNAlater
solution and stored at 4C overnight
(>16h). The tissues were then stored at
À80C until required for analysis. Tissue
samples from IBD and corresponding
normal tissues were collected during pre-
treatment endoscopic biopsies and prepared
as described above.
RNA isolation from clinical tissues
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA).
Tissues were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, speed
500 xg for 5 min, then cell pellets were
homogenized in 1.0 ml TRIzol reagent and
incubated at room temperature for 5 min.
Each sample was treated with 200 ml of
chloroform, repeatedly inverted for 15 s,
then incubated at room temperature for
10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at
12,800 rpm for 10 min at 4C, and the col-
ourless supernatant was transferred to a
fresh tube and treated with the same
volume of isopropyl alcohol. After incuba-
tion at 4C for 10 min, samples were again
centrifuged at 12,800 rpm for 10 min at 4C,
the supernatant was removed, and the pellet
was washed with 75% ethanol. Samples
were centrifuged twice at 11,800 rpm for
5 min at 4C, with removal of the super-
natant after the first centrifugation, then the
pellet was dried at room temperature and
dissolved in RNase-free water. The RNA
concentration was quantified by a
Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
qRT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Promega).
Briefly, 10 -ml reverse transcription reactions
contained 2 nM miRNA RT primers,
500 mM dNTPs, 0.2 ml M-MLV reverse tran-
scriptase, and 1 mg total RNA. Conditions
were as follows: 16C for 30 min followed by
42C for 1 h and 75C for 10 min. The real-
time PCR system contained 10 ml SYBR
Premix Ex Taq, 0.5 ml upstream primer,
0.5 ml downstream primer (2.5 mM), 1 ml
cDNA, and 8 ml RNase-free H2
O. The reac-
tion was incubated at 95C for 30 s, followed
by 45 cycles of 95C for 5 s, then 60C for
30 s. miRNA expression was analysed using
the 2 ÀÁÁCt method, and U6 was selected as
the control gene. Primer sequences are
shown in Table S1. SPSS 17.0 software was
used to perform statistical analysis. Data
were shown as the mean Æ SD. The t-test
was used for analysis between cancer tissue
and adjacent normal tissue or between
disease and control group. Significance was
defined as P value < 0.05.
Gene expression profiling data collection
We downloaded human global gene expres-
sion profiles representing transcriptional
responses to miRNA perturbations and
disease states from GEO dataset (GDS)
records produced by two platforms, the
Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0
array (GPL570) and the Affymetrix human
genome U133A array (GPL96). These two
human microarray platforms are the most
frequently used in GEO and include over
20,000 genes, which is favourable for use
with the GSEA algorithm.12,13,18,19 Human
GDS records with a ``disease state'' subtype

description were downloaded as disease
state datasets and were manually examined
in ExpTreeDB.17 Datasets related to
miRNA perturbations were downloaded
from GEO series (GSE) resources, and
detailed treatments as well as miRNA
entries were manually extracted. A similar
approach was used to obtain small RNA
silencing datasets. We required that one
gene expression profile related to a given
perturbation must include a blank control
group so that transcriptional responses to
perturbations could be clearly defined.
Generating a ranked gene list
Within each GEO dataset, we manually
selected the experimental group of a par-
ticular perturbation. The experimental
groups were then manually matched to
normal control groups. Specific genotype
variations and disease states were defined
as ``perturbations'' to cells that induce
transcriptional responses. Following the
approach used in ExpTreeDB,17 we gener-
ated a phenotype ranked list (PRL) to
denote the transcriptional response to a
perturbation such as miRNA overexpres-
sion, gene silencing, or disease state. In
brief, pair-wise global gene expression
fold-changes were calculated, and all
fold-change lists under a certain perturb-
ation were merged into a PRL using a
hierarchical majority voting scheme to pre-
vent poor representation of heterogeneous
experimental settings.20 Thus, the genes
showing the highest level of up/down-
regulation (presented as microarray probe
names) under each permutation were placed
at the top/bottom of the corresponding
PRL.
For the disease state, two perturbations
were defined to a different extent: a descrip-
tion of the disease, such as IBD, and the
provision of more detailed information about
stage or subtype, such as ulcerative colitis
(UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). We generated
PRLs for both definitions, and correlation
calculations showed that the two PRLs had
high correlation coefficients (Enrichment
Score¼ 0.662, Figure 1). Therefore, in this
study we employed a general description of
disease states and perturbation definitions
(Table 1 and Figure 1).
Similarity determinations based on
the GSEA algorithm
We quantified pair-wise similarities among
PRLs as correlation scores based on GSEA.
Following the strategy used by Iorio
et al,13,20 we extracted the top 250 and the
bottom 250 probes as gene signatures. The R
package Gene Expression Signature with
integrated GSEA was used for the similarity
calculations.21 In brief, the enrichment of a
signature in a PRL is estimated by the
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test for uniform dis-
tributions. The signature of permutation A
is represented as (upA
, downA
), with upA
representing the top 250 probe sets and
downA
representing the bottom 250 ones.
The final similarity score of PRLs between
perturbation A and B (SA, B
) is defined as the
average enrichment score:
SA,B ¼
ESupB
A
þ ESupA
B
À ESdownB
A
À ESdownA
A
4
ESs
p
is the enrichment score of signature s
(up- and down-regulated parts separated)
with respect to the PRL p. Thus, positive
similarity scores represent similar regulation
tendencies, while negative correlation scores
represent opposite regulation tendencies.
Results
Overview of miRNA­disease similarities
From GSE records, we obtained transcrip-
tional responses including genotype
variation of 30 miRNAs for nine knock-
down and 21 overexpression treatments.
Variations in Drosha, importin 8 (IPO8),
Ni et al. 599
and DGCR8 were also included for
their functions in miRNA biogenesis.
Transcriptional responses representing 42
distinct disease states were collected from
GDS records. Based on a GSEA-centred
pipeline, we calculated the pair-wise simila-
rities between the transcriptional responses
of miRNA variations and disease states
(Figure 2(a)). We found that the overall
miRNA­disease similarity values followed a
normal distribution (mean ¼ À0.002, vari-
ance ¼ 0.074, Figure 2(b)). However, we also
observed some outliers with extreme simi-
larity scores.
Correlated miRNA­disease links
We next focused on highly correlated tran-
scriptional responses to miRNA variation
and disease states. The top 5% of miRNA­

phenotype ranked list where the genes showing the most up-regulation are placed at the top while the most
down-regulated genes are at the bottom. The correlation scores were computed by measuring gene
regulation in correspondence with the GSEA method to obtain a score from À1 to þ1. The color scale shows
positive correlations in red and negative correlations in blue.

and 28 diseases, which are referred to as
correlated, are shown in Table 2. The correl-
ations were also illustrated by network to
exhibit hubs of miRNA variations and dis-
eases. Among these correlations, we observed
both ``hub'' miRNAs and diseases. Four
diseases were linked to four miRNA vari-

multiple myeloma, and carious pulp. The
overexpression of miR-210 was correlated
with eight disease states, with endometriosis
found at the 0.43% percentile. The co-
overexpression of miR-338-3 p and miR-451
was also correlated with seven diseases.
Interestingly, we found that silencing of

that Drosha or DGCR8, also functional
during miRNA biogenesis, were within the

variation containing a single miRNA type:
miR-335.
Experimental validation of miRNA
differential expression
We selected correlated miRNA links in both
disease state samples and controls. Based
on bio-sample availability, we selected
oesophageal cancer samples to analyse
miR-200 c expression (OE), and colorectal
cancer samples to assess miR-16 (OE) and
miR-124 expression (OE). We also included
IBD samples for miR-124 expression as a
comparison with previous studies.
We observed consistently high up-regula-
tion of miR-200 c in the oesophageal cancer
samples compared with adjacent control
samples (Figure 3). Of four sample pairs,
miR-200 c was expressed >47-fold in adeno-
carcinoma, and in another pair it was
expressed 261-fold compared with controls.
This result strongly agreed with our predic-
tion that microRNA-200c highly correlated
with the development of oesophageal
cancer. We also identified six genes that
were significantly (P < 0.01) downregulated
in association with miR-200 c overexpres-
sion and in oesophageal cancer samples
using GEO2R of the GEO database. We
queried these six genes in TarBase,15 and
found that one, ELMO2, has been experi-
mentally validated as a target of miR-
200 c.22
We did not observe consistent upregu-
lated expression of miR-16 or miR-124 in
either IBD or colorectal cancer samples

compared with controls (Figure 4). In colo-
rectal tissue samples from two CD and three
UC patients, miR-124 was shown to be
upregulated in two (one CD and one UC).
The expression profiles were similar to those
of miR-16/24 in colorectal cancer samples.
Discussion
Screening results based on microarray
analysis are usually unstable and less func-
tionally related than those derived from
other assays. In this study, we connected
miRNAs with diseases to better determine
their functional relationships. We found
that hsa-miR-200 c was upregulated >47-
fold in five oesophageal cancer samples
compared with normal samples. We also
identified the experimentally validated
miRNA target ELMO2 as a potential func-
tional link connecting hsa-miR-200 c and
oesophageal cancer through a simple over-
lap analysis of significantly down-regulated
genes in hsa-miR-200 c interference and
oesophageal cancer samples.
We observed only a slight increase or no
change in miR-124 expression in IBD
patient samples compared with controls.
This is inconsistent with the findings of
Koukos et al., who reported miR-124 down-
regulation in UC samples. This difference
could be explained by individual variation in
miRNA levels even among patients with the
same disease, reflecting differences in

development stage or genetic background.
Alternatively, it could be caused by the small
sample size in our study.
Relationships between IBD, miR-16, and
miR-124 have previously been reported,23,24
and the dysregulation of miR-16 has been
observed in both CD and UC.23,25 The
decreased expression of miR-124 has also
been suggested to play a role in promoting
inflammation and the pathogenesis of UC
through up-regulating signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3.23 Moreover,
miR-335 has previously been shown to
play a role in multiple myeloma,26 while
miR-210 was reported to be induced by
hypoxia in breast cancer.27 This agrees with
our observation that half of the diseases
associated with miR-210 in the present study
were solid tumours, which are known to
often be hypoxic.28,29
A large systematic collection of gene
expression changes resulting from cellular
exposure to perturbations such as small
molecules and genetic variations would

help the understanding of cellular pathways
and the development of therapies and
biomarkers. The Library of Integrated
Network-Based Cellular Signatures project
founded by the National Institutes of Health
has therefore been established. This work
should increase the power of simulated
screening following the accumulation of
expression change information under vari-
ous perturbations.
The main limitation of our study is that
we only investigated a small number of
miRNAs in association with disease. In the
future, we plan to include more diseases
and miRNAs and to increase the number of
patient samples. We also aim to further
explore the relationships between miRNA
and diseases using in vivo studies.
