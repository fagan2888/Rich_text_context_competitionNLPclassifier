ABSTRACT: In attempt to improve diagnostic agreement between manufacturers, a recent software update
incorporated NHANES III data in GE Lunar densitometers. As a result, the femur neck and trochanter
T-scores were lowered, and osteoporosis prevalence was increased. Use of a recalculated young-normal SD for
the GE Lunar­adjusted NHANES III database improved diagnostic agreement and is recommended.
Introduction: Use of manufacturer-specific normative databases for T-score derivation leads to discordance in
T-score values and differences in diagnostic classification. To address this issue, the International Committee
for Standards in Bone Measurement (ICSBM) recommended the NHANES III database for femur T-score
derivation. Acquired on Hologic (Hol) instruments, this database requires conversion equations for applica-
tion to other DXA systems. NHANES III total femur (TF) conversions for GE Lunar (GE) have previously
been available, and femoral neck (FN) and trochanter (TR) equations were reported recently. Per the ICSBM
recommendation, GE Lunar incorporated these values into their female database. This should produce
T-score and diagnostic agreement between Hol and GE instruments; however, this has not been evaluated.
Materials and Methods: We compared GE femur scans in 115 postmenopausal women using software before
and after the NHANES III software update. Subsequently, T-scores derived from femur scans obtained on GE
and Hol densitometers were compared in a different group of 89 postmenopausal women.
Results: The NHANES III software update had no effect on measured BMD (g/cm2) at any femur region.
However, because of changes in values used for T-score calculation (increase in the mean young-normal BMD
at the FN and TR and a reduction in SD at the TR), the T-scores were lower (mean, 0.48 and 0.68, respec-
tively) at the FN and TR using post-NHANES III software. Consequently, this update increased femur
osteoporosis prevalence in these 115 women from 7.8% to 18.3%. Comparison of GE with Hol total proximal
femur T-scores revealed a minimal difference (<0.1) and equal diagnoses of osteoporosis. FN and TR differ-
ences were larger, with mean GE T-scores lower than Hol (p < 0.001) by 0.17 and 0.50, respectively, thereby
introducing osteoporosis diagnostic disagreement (13 [GE] versus 9 [Hol]). Our evaluation suggested that this
disparity resulted from direct application of published NHANES III SDs at the FN and TR. As such, we
applied the conversion formulae to the NHANES III published Hologic data and found the FN and TR SDs
were greater than assumed by GE. Using our recalculated SD to derive T-scores reduced the mean GE/Hol
T-score difference to 0.03 at the FN and 0.32 at the TR and resolved osteoporosis diagnostic disagreement.
Conclusion: The GE NHANES III software update leads to lower FN and TR T-scores than obtained with
Hol or prior GE software. Recalculation of the young-normal SD reduces this difference and is recommended.
Clinicians are advised to avoid using the TR for diagnosis or, at a minimum, use caution when making
treatment decisions based solely on T-score at this site.

INTRODUCTION
THE WORLD HEALTH Organization (WHO) criteria
specify that osteoporosis is present in postmenopausal
women when the BMD is 2.5 SD or more below that of the
mean in a young adult population.(1) This approach is ap-
plied clinically as a T-score of -2.5 or below with the T-score

defined as follows: (individual's BMD - young-adult mean
BMD)/SD of the young-adult normal population. As such,
the population used to define the young-adult mean BMD
and the variability within this group substantially impacts
osteoporosis prevalence using this T-score­based ap-
proach.(2­6) Because manufacturer-developed proprietary
databases use different populations, the young-adult mean
BMD and/or SD may differ.(2) Thus, the diagnostic classi-
fication of an individual as normal, osteopenic, or osteopo-
rotic may vary depending on the densitometer used.(3)
Ideally, all bone mass measurement devices would use
the same population to define the young-normal mean
BMD and SD, a process that does lead to derivation of
similar T-scores with instruments of different manufactur-
ers.(4) Although use of a single large sample population to
develop a uniform normative database for all densitometers
has been suggested,(5,6) this process has not been imple-
mented. To improve harmonization of diagnostic classifica-
tion, the International Committee for Standards in Bone
Measurement (ICSBM) agreed on a universal reference da-
tabase for the femur based on NHANES III,(7) the only
large standardized reference database ever published.(1,8)
Because the NHANES III data were acquired using Ho-
logic densitometers, the ICSBM published formulae to con-
vert measured BMD into standardized BMD at the total
femur, thereby allowing use of the NHANES III database
by other densitometer manufacturers.(7,9­11) This method-
ology allowed for calculation of total proximal femur T-
scores from a common young-adult database, thereby re-
moving the T-score discrepancy between Hologic and GE
Lunar that had previously existed at this skeletal site.(3)
Recently, Lu et. al.(12) published standardization equations
allowing the NHANES III database to be used at the femur
neck and trochanteric subregions. Subsequently, GE Lunar
used these conversion equations to incorporate NHANES
III data at the femur neck and trochanter into their soft-
ware, beginning with version 7.0 in the fall of 2002. Because
the earlier application of NHANES data did not materially
change the total femur T-score from that derived using the
GE Lunar normative database, it might be anticipated that
this software update would not alter femur neck or trochan-
ter T-scores. However, the impact of the software upgrade
on T-scores as determined using GE Lunar densitometers
has not been reported.
We initially noted that this software upgrade seemed to
lower femur neck and trochanter T-scores. If lower T-
scores at the same BMD resulted from this software update,
the number of women diagnosed as "low" using the WHO
criteria would be increased. To investigate this possibility,
we evaluated the effect of this update on osteoporosis
prevalence in a group of postmenopausal women measured
using a GE Lunar densitometer. Furthermore, it would be
expected that use of a common normative database, in this
case NHANES III, would produce T-score and diagnostic
agreement between densitometer manufacturers. To inves-
tigate this, we subsequently evaluated whether the software
upgrade produced diagnostic agreement between GE Lu-
nar and Hologic densitometers in a second group of post-
menopausal women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Terminology and databases used
A summary of software versions and normative data-
bases used in this study with the female young-normal
mean BMD and SD are presented in Table 1. Before the
GE Lunar software update (instituted at software version
7.0 in November of 2002), NHANES III data were used
only for total femur T-score calculation. The total femur
values were previously derived by converting the published
Hologic value to sBMD and converting this to a Lunar-
equivalent BMD by rearranging the sBMD equation. Sub-
sequently, GE Lunar incorporated NHANES III values by
applying conversion equations to the published young-
normal mean BMD as measured by Hologic instruments
while employing the published SD of BMD, as measured by
Hologic instruments, to derive T-scores at all hip regions.
We recalculated the young-normal mean BMD and SD
for GE Lunar using published young-normal mean BMD
and SD values at the hip from the 409 non-Hispanic white
females 20­29 years of age in the NHANES III cohort.(1)
Equations for converting Hologic BMD values to Lunar-
equivalent BMD values were obtained from an author of
the publication from Lu et al. (T Fuerst, personal commu-
nication, 2004), which are as follows:
Total Proximal Femur: GE Lunar  0.038 + 1.030 × Ho-
logic
Femur Neck: GE Lunar  0.045 + 1.158 × Hologic
Trochanter: GE Lunar  0.026 + 1.164 × Hologic

ues and SDs were determined using standard formulas for
linear transformations. In particular, if we apply the linear
transformation y = a + b × x to data with mean (x) and SD
SD(x), the transformed data have mean (y) = a + b × µ(x)
and SD SD(y) = b × SD(x). The T-scores derived using this
approach are referred to as "recalculated" results.
Subjects
Effect of GE Lunar NHANES III software update: A to-
tal of 115 postmenopausal women was randomly selected
from a population that responded to newspaper advertising
to obtain BMD measurement at the University of Wiscon-
sin Osteoporosis Clinical Center and Research Program
(Madison, WI). Each woman received a single lumbar spine
and left hip measurement using standard scan protocols on
a GE Lunar Prodigy. All of these women were white, with
a mean age and weight of 65.6 years (range, 42.9­90.3 years)
and 156 lbs (range, 100­275 lbs), respectively. On review by
the University of Wisconsin IRB, acquisition of informed
consent was waived because all subject identifiers were re-
moved from these scans.
GE Lunar/Hologic comparison: As part of a different
study to compare GE Lunar Prodigy and Hologic Delphi
densitometers, 90 women (30 each from three osteoporosis
centers) were recruited. Their mean age was 61.6 ± 1.0 (SE)
years. The three clinical sites were the Department of Ra-
diology, University of California at San Francisco, CA; the
New Mexico Clinical Research and Osteoporosis Center,
Albuquerque, NM; and the Colorado Center for Bone Re-
search, Lakewood, CO. Each woman received a total of
four hip scans, two each using a GE Lunar Prodigy and
Hologic Delphi. After their initial scan, all patients stood up
and were subsequently repositioned, and these scans were
repeated in their entirety. IRB approval was obtained for
this study, and all participants provided written informed
consent.
Scan analysis
All scans were performed by International Society for
Clinical Densitometry­certified technologists who used
manufacturer-recommended acquisition and analysis tech-
niques.
GE Lunar NHANES III software update: Each scan was
initially auto-analyzed using either software version 6.60 or
6.70 to obtain the pre-NHANES III software update T-
scores. No operator adjustment to region of interest place-
ment or point typing was performed. Subsequently, all hip
scan files were auto-reanalyzed using software version 7.53
to obtain post-NHANES III software update T-scores.
GE Lunar/Hologic comparison: Hologic Delphi software
version 11.2 and GE Lunar Prodigy software versions 7.50
and 7.51 using the NHANES III update were used for all
initial analyses. Subsequently, all GE Lunar scans were re-
analyzed with software before the NHANES III update.
For this repeat analysis, auto-reanalysis was performed on
all femur scans, and no operator adjustment to region of
interest placement or point typing was performed. The av-
erage left femur T-score of the two scans performed on
each densitometer was used for comparison. One patient
was excluded because her anatomy and positioning pre-
cluded appropriate femur region of interest placement.
Statistical analyses
Bland Altman analyses (Analyze-it, Leeds, UK) and
paired t-tests (Statview Abacus, Cary, NC, USA) were use
to compare BMD and T-scores obtained with the GE Lu-
nar "pre" and "post" NHANES III software update. These
analyzes were also performed on the GE Lunar/Hologic
comparison data. Regression analysis was used to compare
GE and Hologic T-scores. The effects of reference database
on WHO diagnostic categorization were evaluated using
McNemar's test, a test for paired proportions that analyzes
the number of disagreements (Analyze-it). Paired t-tests
were used to compare BMD and T-scores for patients mea-
sured on both GE Lunar and Hologic DXA systems, and p
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Impact of database on average young-normal BMD
and SD
As noted in Table 1, the NHANES III software update
resulted in an increase in young-normal mean BMD of
5.9% at the femur neck and 7.7% at the trochanter com-
pared with the GE Lunar normative database. Further-
more, the SD at the trochanter was decreased by 10%.
Either of these changes (i.e., an increase in young-normal
mean BMD or a reduction in SD) will increase the number
of women diagnosed as low when using the WHO diagnos-
tic criteria. Our recalculated NHANES III values also led
to an increase in young-normal mean BMD at the femur
neck and trochanter; however, the SD also increased at
these sites compared with that used with the post-
NHANES software.
GE Lunar NHANES III software update
Proximal femur BMD: The GE Lunar NHANES III soft-
ware update did not alter measured BMD at the total proxi-
mal femur, femur neck, or trochanter (data not shown),
with the exception of three individuals. In 3 of the 115
women, total proximal femur BMD differed by 0.001 g/cm2;
in 1 of these 3 women, the trochanter BMD also differed by
0.001 g/cm2. Measured BMD at all three femoral subre-
gions was identical for the remaining subjects.
Proximal femur T-score and osteoporosis prevalence-
comparisons: T-scores of the total proximal femur, al-
though statistically different (p < 0.0001), were clinically
unchanged, differing by only 0.02, when derived using soft-
ware before ("pre") and after ("post") the NHANES III
software update (Fig. 1A). However, at the femur neck
(Fig. 1B) and trochanter (Fig. 1C), all subjects had a lower
T-score using the post-NHANES III update software. The
mean T-score decrease resulting from use of the updated
software was 0.48 at the femoral neck and 0.68 at the tro-
chanter. The T-scores were lower (p < 0.0001) because of an
increase in young-adult mean BMD at the neck and tro-
chanter and a concomitant reduction in trochanteric SD
(Table 1) compared with the GE Lunar database. As a
result of this T-score decrease, the number of women with

osteoporosis at the femur according to WHO criteria in-
creased (p  0.0005) from 9 (7.8%) to 21 (18.3%) after the
NHANES III software update. Additionally 20% fewer
women (p < 0.001) were classified as having normal bone
mass after the NHANES III software update (Table 2;
Fig. 3).
GE Lunar/Hologic comparison
As is widely recognized,(9,12) the measured BMD (g/cm2)
at all femur sites was lower (p < 0.0001) using Hologic
densitometers than with GE Lunar instruments (Table 3).
These differences between densitometers of various manu-
facturers reflect different methods of dual-energy X-ray
generation, edge detection paradigms, and region of inter-
est placement.(13) Specifically, in this study, the mean Ho-
logic-measured BMD was 7.8%, 17.8%, and 13.6% lower at
the total proximal femur, femur neck, and trochanter, re-
spectively, than that measured using GE Lunar densitom-
eters.
T-scores at the total proximal femur were very similar,
with a mean difference (p < 0.01) of 0.08. Specifically, the
mean total proximal femur T-score in this population was
­0.79 using GE Lunar and ­0.87 with Hologic densitom-
eters. This small difference likely does not have clinical
significance. Consistent with absence of a clinically mean-
ingful effect, in this population, an equal number of women
(n  6) were diagnosed as osteoporotic at the total proxi-
mal femur. Femur neck and trochanter differences (p 
0.002) were larger, and the mean GE Lunar T-scores were
lower by 0.17 and 0.50 at these sites, respectively; mean
femur T-scores are presented in Fig. 2. Given the lower
T-scores, one would expect that a larger number of women
would be diagnosed with osteoporosis using GE Lunar den-
sitometers. Overall, using the lowest T-score of the total
proximal femur, femur neck, and trochanter, 13 (14.6%) of
these women were classified as osteoporotic with GE Lunar
densitometers compared with 9 (10.1%) with Hologic in-
struments (Fig. 3).
Effect of SD recalculation on
osteoporosis prevalence
Because our observations suggested that the demon-
strated increase in osteoporosis diagnosis with the GE Lu-
nar NHANES III software update might be caused by dif-
ferences in SD, we evaluated T-score and diagnostic
agreement using our recalculated values. Using our recal-
culated SD to derive T-scores reduced osteoporosis preva-
lence in the initial group of 115 women from 18.3% to
7.8%. In the GE/Hologic comparison group, the mean T-
score difference was reduced to 0.03 at the FN and 0.32 at
the trochanter (Fig. 2). As a result, an equal number of
women (9) were diagnosed as osteoporotic at the femur
(Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
Previous observations demonstrate the importance of us-
ing a standard normative database for T-score deriva-
tion(3,4) to enhance diagnostic agreement. However, acqui-
sition of NHANES III data exclusively using Hologic
densitometers(8) initially precluded database standardiza-
FIG. 1. (A­C) Effect of NHANES III software update on femur
T-scores. Total femur T-scores in 115 postmenopausal women
were very similar (bias of 0.02 T-score). However, substantial bias
was present after the NHANES III update at the femur neck; the
T-score for all subjects was 0.4 or 0.5 lower. This reflects an in-
crease in young-normal mean BMD from 0.980 to 1.038 g/cm2
(pre- to post-update) without change in SD. Similarly, the tro-
chanter T-score was 0.4­1.1 lower because of an increase in
young-normal mean BMD from 0.790 to 0.851 g/cm2 (pre- to post-
update) and an SD decrease from 0.110 to 0.099/cm2.

tion among manufacturers. To rectify this problem, conver-
sion equations were previously developed allowing incor-
poration of total proximal femur NHANES III data into
other manufacturers normative databases. Therefore, be-
fore the recent update, when "USA/NHANES" was se-
lected in GE Lunar software, T-scores were derived using
converted NHANES III data at the total proximal femur
but not at the femur neck or trochanter, where the manu-
facturer's normative database was used. Our study shows
that the recent availability of equations allowing application
of the NHANES III database to the femur neck and tro-
chanter(12) results in lower T-scores at these sites than was
previously the case with the GE Lunar normative database.
This reduction in T-score is caused by increase in mean
BMD combined with reduction in SD of the young-normal
population. As such, osteoporosis prevalence (using the
WHO criteria) is increased compared with prior GE soft-
ware and also compared with Hologic. Recalculation of the

similar (range, -0.87 to -0.75) regardless of densitometer or soft-

tween GE Lunar and Hologic were present at the femur neck and
trochanter using either the pre- or post-NHANES III software
update. Recalculation of the young-normal mean BMD and SD
resolved the between-manufacturer difference at the femur neck
but not at the trochanter.

the T-score decrease that resulted from the GE Lunar NHANES

lence from 7.8% to 18.3% in this population of 115 women post-
menopausal women. In a second population of 89 women, use of
our recalculated young-normal mean BMD and SD led to classi-
fying an identical number (9) as osteoporotic with GE Lunar and
Hologic instruments.
NHANES DATABASE AND OSTEOPOROSIS DIAGNOSIS 199
SD from published NHANES III data reduces the T-score
difference between GE Lunar and Hologic and yields an
equal number of women diagnosed as osteoporotic. Al-
though not tested in this study, it is reasonable to assume
that the SD correction would improve T-score agreement
not only for GE Lunar Prodigy but also pencil-beam sys-
tems. Thus, use of existing GE Lunar software that has
incorporated converted NHANES III data at all femur sub-
regions (versions 7.0 or higher) is not recommended.
In an attempt to minimize diagnostic discordance among
manufacturers, the ICSBM previously endorsed use of the
NHANES III database for T-score derivation at the hip.(7)
On recalculation of the young-adult SD, this study shows
good agreement between GE Lunar and Hologic at the
total proximal femur and femur neck. Thus, the expectation
that use of a common database would lead to similar T-
scores and diagnosis is corroborated, and use of NHANES
III as the default hip database is affirmed. Recalculation
and use of updated SD values at the femur neck and tro-
chanter for GE densitometers is recommended.
In the interim, clinicians using GE Lunar densitometers
must be aware of the clinical impact of these reference
database changes that were incorporated into enCORE
software versions 7.0 and later. Because the femur neck and
trochanter T-scores are lowered by 0.5 and 0.7, respec-
tively, diagnostic classification may worsen, despite stable
BMD, in women whose bone mass is being monitored over
time. Such individuals should be advised that a change in
the data used for T-score determination, not a worsening of
their condition, has occurred. Additionally, some individu-
als receiving osteoporosis preventive therapy could, on fol-
low-up BMD measurement, have a statistically significant
increase in bone mass, but worsening of their diagnostic
categorization from osteopenia to osteoporosis. Clinicians
and their patients must be aware that this "worsening" of
diagnostic status should not promote patient anxiety or lead
to changes in therapeutic regimen, because it is simply a
phenomenon of the software change. Additionally, it must
be emphasized that therapeutic response should always
be evaluated using change in BMD (g/cm2) and not T-
scores.(14) Furthermore, if/when GE Lunar software up-
grades incorporate recalculated NHANES III values, the
above noted issues should be improved.
The observation that both the GE Lunar NHANES III
software update and our recalculated values result in lower
trochanter T-scores on GE Lunar instruments compared
with the prior database, coupled with the observation that
the T-score is now lower at this site than that observed with
Hologic densitometers, is cause for concern. It is important
to note that conversion equations for the hip regions were
derived from data acquired with an earlier generation GE
Lunar densitometer (DPX-L.)(12) Thus, it is possible that
improvements in GE Lunar trochanter edge detection pro-
grams that have occurred since that time are cause for this
discrepancy. Regardless, discordance between GE Lunar
and Hologic exists at the trochanter, such that more women
will be diagnosed as "low" at this site when using GE Lunar
densitometers than with Hologic. It is suggested that for-
mulas allowing NHANES III data application to non-
Hologic densitometers be developed using current genera-
tion instrumentation. Additionally, until this discordance is
resolved, it seems prudent for clinicians to avoid using the
trochanter for diagnosis when using GE Lunar post-
NHANES III update software, or at a minimum, use cau-
tion when making treatment decisions based solely on tro-
chanter T-score.
It is important to recognize that these T-score changes
associated with updating the GE Lunar NHANES III soft-
ware apply only to women. Equations allowing conversion
of NHANES III data in men at the femur neck and tro-
chanter have not been published, and Lu et. al.(12) specifi-
cally caution that "...more research is needed to determine
whether these results can be extended to other races and to
men." As such, in all GE Lunar software versions, the
manufacturer's proprietary normative database, not the
NHANES III database, is used for men to derive T-scores
at the femur neck and trochanter despite the statement on
the printout that the "NHANES/USA" femur reference
population is used.
T-score discrepancies, and therefore differences in diag-
nostic categorization, can be caused by multiple factors in-
cluding differences in technology, sites at which BMD is
measured, and normative database used.(15) Additionally,
as this study emphasizes, software updates may substan-
tially alter T-score without affecting the measured BMD. In
the case of this particular software update, it is clear that the
"normal" populations are not identical as the young-normal
mean BMD, and SDs differ between the NHANES III and
GE Lunar normative databases. It is not surprising that the
young-normal populations differ, because NHANES used
age 20­29 and GE Lunar used age 20­40. Nonetheless,
these differences are smaller at the total femur, possibly
because of the larger amount of bone being measured, than
at the femur subregions. Although not evaluated in this
study, it is possible that similar diagnostic disagreement ex-
ists at other skeletal sites. In fact, available data suggest that
T-score agreement between manufacturers is quite good at
the lumbar spine in women,(16) but not in men,(17) and that
diagnostic discordance exists at the radius.(17) Attainment
of a common database, by measuring BMD in a large num-
ber of young adults on all instruments, would rectify this
situation. In the absence of such, it is not possible to deter-
mine which database or manufacturer is "right." Therefore,
use of NHANES III after recalculation of the SD is the best
available option to achieve diagnostic agreement at the fe-
mur at this time.
Finally, this study emphasizes that the T-score based sys-
tem of diagnosis is not ideal. The prevalence of osteopenia
and osteoporosis in a population, and these diagnoses in
individual patients, may vary according to the mean BMD
and SD of the young-normal population; values that may
vary substantially if different populations are used to con-
struct the normative database. As such, T-score values may
vary substantially despite similar BMD. Efforts to standard-
ize reference databases are encouraged in that establish-
ment of a single young-normal reference database among
all densitometry manufacturers would minimize such diag-
nostic discrepancies. Additionally, the use of fracture risk
reporting may become a useful complement to diagnostic

classification by T-score, thereby allowing improved selec-
tion of patients for therapeutic intervention.
In conclusion, the GE Lunar software update that allows
application of NHANES III data at the femur neck and
trochanter leads to lower T-scores at these sites. Recalcu-
lation of the NHANES III young-normal SD reduces this
difference, but discrepancy remains at the trochanter, rais-
ing questions regarding conversion equation accuracy at
this site. Use of recalculated NHANES III values at the
femur subregions for GE Lunar densitometers is recom-
mended. Clinicians must be aware of this database impact
on diagnosis and watch for a software upgrade correcting
the SD to assure optimal patient care. Difficulties with the
T-score­based diagnostic system, such as those noted here,
should further prompt development of diagnostic criteria
that include estimates of absolute fracture risk. However, as
an absolute fracture risk­based system is likely to retain use
of T-scores, standardization of their derivation will remain
essential to assure uniform diagnosis of osteoporosis.
