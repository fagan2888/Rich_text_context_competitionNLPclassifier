Differences in coronary disease have been reported among ethnic minorities in the US population. Whether these persist in
patients with chronic kidney disease is unknown. The prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) and angina was compared by
race and GFR in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
Study equation. Age­gender standardized estimates were computed for each GFR category (>90, 60 to 89, and <60 ml/min per
1.73 m2), and odds ratios were compared using weighted multivariable logistic regression for each race. The age­gender
standardized prevalence of MI was 3.0, 3.1, and 4.9% in white individuals; 2.8, 3.8, and 9.9% in black individuals; and 1.9, 2.9,
and 3.8% in Mexican-American individuals in each category: >90, 60 to 89, and <60 ml/min, respectively. Compared with the
referent (Mexican-American; GFR >90 ml/min; odds ratio 1.00), Mexican-American individuals with GFR of 60 to 89 and <60
ml/min had more than four and nine times the odds for MI; black individuals at successively lower GFR levels had 1.6, 6.1,
and 16.3 times the odds for MI, whereas white individuals had 1.9, 4.7, and 20.2 times that of the referent, respectively. After
adjustment for traditional risk factors, the inverse association of GFR with MI was substantially attenuated in black and white
individuals and completely abolished in Mexican-American individuals. The burden of coronary disease is lower in Mexican-
American than in white or black individuals with reduced kidney function even accounting for differences in traditional risk
factors.

Cardiovascular (CV) mortality rates are exceedingly
high in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease
(CKD) compared with the general population, a phe-
nomenon that is due partly to the high prevalence of CV
disease as well as the strikingly low use of proven cardiovas-
cular interventions (1­6). Recent data suggest that the risk for
CV death is not equal among race groups with reduced kidney
function and may represent inherent differences in underlying
CV risk as well as differences in access to and use of effective
CV interventions (6,7). The identification of true differences in
CV risk factor profiles among race groups and the extent to
which they might account for differences in underlying coro-
nary disease prevalence may improve our understanding of
coronary disease in those with CKD and help unravel racial
disparities in CV outcomes.
In the general population, Hispanic individuals experience
lower all-cause and CV mortality rates than their non-Hispanic
counterparts (8­11). This apparent CV benefit is present despite
that Hispanics tend to have more unfavorable CV profiles with
higher rates of diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance com-
pared with whites or black individuals (12­15). Moreover, this
"paradoxic advantage" of Hispanic ethnicity over non-His-
panic persists even when consideration is made for several
nontraditional CV factors. Although patients with CKD are at
increased risk for CV disease overall, it is unclear whether this
risk is differentially distributed among racial/ethnic groups. In
addition, it is unclear whether the favorable risk that is present
for Hispanic individuals in the general population also extends
to those with reduced kidney function.
The goals of this study were to (1) describe the prevalence of
self-reported physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI) and
angina by race among individuals with reduced kidney function
in the US population, (2) compare the prevalence of traditional
risk factors and nontraditional risk factors among racial/ethnic
categories, and (3) determine the extent to which differences in the
prevalence of MI across race could be accounted for by differences
in traditional and nontraditional risk factor burden. The oversam-
pling of minorities from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) allowed us a unique oppor-
tunity to evaluate these differences in patients with reduced kid-
ney function in the US population.

Materials and Methods
Data for this analysis were obtained from NHANES III, a population-
based survey that was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (16). The
survey was designed to provide accurate information on a representa-
tive sample of noninstitutionalized individuals who were living in the
United States between 1988 and 1994. Detailed descriptions of the study
have been published previously. The NHANES III used a complex
stratified multistage sampling design that included oversampling of the
very young, elderly, and ethnic minorities, allowing calculation of
stable prevalence estimates in these vulnerable groups. Data collection
consisted of a standardized questionnaire that was administered dur-
ing a home interview followed by a detailed physical examination that
included collection of blood specimens at a mobile examination center
or at the participant's home.
Sample
Our analysis was restricted to adult (20 yr or older), nonpregnant
participants (n  18,595) who reported their race and ethnicity as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican-American (n 
17,885). Respondents who did not participate in the examination com-
ponent (n  1752) or had missing serum creatinine measurements (n 
1123) were excluded. The final sample used in this study contained
15,010 participants who represented 152,443,703 adults in the US pop-
ulation.
Measurements
The NHANES III provided data that were collected from face-to-face
interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory results. The follow-
ing self-reported variables were extracted from the interview portion:
age; gender; race/ethnicity; family history of premature (50 yr) MI;
tobacco use; physical inactivity; and self-report of a previous physician
diagnosis of MI, hypertension, and diabetes. In addition, a diagnosis of
angina was ascertained from questions based on the World Health
Organization (WHO) Rose Angina questionnaire (17). These measures
have been used widely to study the prevalence and the natural history
of ischemic heart disease, to predict morbidity and mortality in diverse
populations, and to make population comparisons (18­20).
Data that were collected from the physical examination included
height, weight, waist circumference, and the average of at least three BP
readings. Body mass index was classified according to World Health
Organization guidelines. Abdominal obesity, defined as a waist circum-
ference (cm) 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women, served as an
additional index of overweight.
White blood cells (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum
cholesterol, and serum creatinine values were obtained from the labo-
ratory results data file. The predictive impact of CRP on MI occurrence
and its prognostic role in assessing global CV risk has been demon-
strated in the general population, and recent studies have validated its
contribution in patients with CKD (21­24). Similarly, emerging data
have identified strong associations of elevated WBC count with in-
creased CV risk in the general population, although data in CKD
populations are limited (25­27).
GFR was estimated from the abbreviated Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) Study formula (28,29) as follows: Estimated
GFR  186.3  (serum creatinine mg/dl)1.154 age0.203 (0.742 if
female)  (1.21 if black). Serum creatinine measurements were recali-
brated to the Cleveland Clinic to ensure validity of the results (28,29).
Analytical Methods
Participants were categorized into one of three GFR groups: 90, 60
to 89, and 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (30). Although a more finely
specified categorization would have been desirable, the current classi-
fication ensured adequate power for comparisons among race groups
and is consistent with previous studies (31). GFR estimates that were
200 ml/min were deemed physiologically implausible, and these
patients were assigned a maximal GFR value of 200 for these analyses.
The prevalence of MI, angina, CV risk factors, and inflammatory factors
were calculated for the entire cohort and for each GFR category across
race groups. To account for age and gender differences in the demo-
graphic distribution among racial groups, the prevalence was adjusted
to a standardized population. The US population during the NHANES
III study (1988 to 1994) with mean age 44 yr, 45% male, 76% white, 11%
non-Hispanic black, 5% Mexican American, and 8% other race or
ethnicity served as the reference standard.
Separate univariate and multivariable logistic regression models
were developed to explore the associations of GFR with MI for each
race group with GFR 90 ml/min as the referent category. Model
building was based on an a priori decision to include covariates that
previously were determined to be associated with MI. All traditional
factors and many additional markers of representative measures of
inflammation were considered. Ultimately, three models were con-
structed for each race group: An unadjusted model, a model that
adjusted for all traditional risk factors, and finally a model that adjusted
for traditional factors and inflammatory markers combined. In addi-
tion, a second series of analyses explored the conjoint associations of
GFR and race in a single logistic model. For these, Mexican Americans
with a GFR 90 ml/min served as the referent category, and all other
GFR categories within each racial/ethnic group were compared with
this referent. All multivariable models were restricted to participants
with valid values for all variables, resulting in a final sample size of
14,043 participants. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable
SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC) with the appropriate sampling weights and survey
design variables.
Results
Prevalence of MI and Angina by Level of GFR
Of the 15,010 NHANES III participants included in the final
weighted analysis, the mean age was 44.7 yr (0.5), 76% were
white, 10.9% were black, and 5.1% were Mexican-American.
The overall prevalence of MI was 3.6% in black individuals,
3.5% in white individuals, and 2.5% in Mexican-American in-
dividuals. The age­gender standardized prevalence of MI in-
creased with declining GFR for each racial/ethnic category,
with the greatest increases occurring for those with GFR 60
ml/min per 1.73 m2 as shown in Figure 1. Within GFR catego-
ries, prevalence was greatest for black and white individuals
and lowest for Mexican-American individuals. These differ-
ences were most marked among groups with GFR 60 ml/min,
in which black individuals (9.9%) had twice the prevalence of
MI than white individuals (4.9%) and almost three times that of
Mexican-American individuals (3.8%).
In contrast to MI, the prevalence of angina did not increase in
a graded manner with declining GFR (Figure 2). Among indi-
viduals with a GFR 60 ml/min, the prevalence of angina was
greatest in black (22.3%) and white (26.5%) individual and
almost five-fold higher than in Mexican-American individuals
(4.8%).

Racial Differences in the Prevalence of Traditional Risk
Factors by GFR levels
The pattern of association of traditional and nontraditional
risk factors with race/ethnicity for each GFR category is shown
in Table 1. In general, the prevalence of risk factors increased
with declining GFR for each race group, although significant
differences were present among groups. Among participants
with GFR 60 ml/min, the prevalence of diabetes and hyper-
tension was greater in Mexican-American and black individu-
als compared with white individuals. Moreover, mean systolic
BP and pulse pressure were significantly greater in ethnic mi-
norities with GFR 60 ml/min compared with white individ-
uals. Indeed, when we classified individuals according to the
stage of hypertension, white individuals with CKD had the
highest percentage of patients with normal BP (73.7% in white
individuals versus 45% in black individuals and 51% in Mexi-
can-American individuals), whereas black and Mexican-Amer-
ican individuals had the highest percentages of individuals
with either stage I or II hypertension.
The prevalence of tobacco use (current or former smokers)
was greater in those with GFR 60 ml/min compared with
those with normal kidney function for all race categories.
Within race groups, prevalence was greatest in white individ-
uals (73.1%) and lowest in Mexican-American individuals
(50%) for those with GFR 60 ml/min.
The prevalence of obesity increased with declining GFR for
white (19.7 versus 22.4 versus 52.6%) and Mexican-American
individuals (29.1 versus 29.4 versus 37.1%) but not for black
individuals. Obesity prevalence was highest among white in-
dividuals (52.6%) and lowest among black individuals (28.6%)
with GFR 60 ml/min. The findings were similar when obesity
was defined in terms of waist circumference. Physical inactivity
also increased with declining GFR for all race categories in the
US population. Prevalence of physical inactivity was consis-
tently highest among Mexican-American individuals and low-
est among white individuals in each GFR category.
The pattern of cholesterol and its subfractions also is dem-
onstrated in Table 1. Mean serum total cholesterol levels in-
creased with declining kidney function and were highest for
white (223  5.2 mg/dl) and black (224  7.2 mg/dl) individ-
uals and lowest for Mexican-American individuals (213  7.8
mg/dl). Much of this was attributed to a rise in non-HDL
cholesterol, for which mean levels were highest in white indi-
viduals and lowest in Mexican-American individuals with
CKD. In contrast, HDL levels were lowest in white individuals
(44.3  1.1 mg/dl) and highest in black individuals (54.4  2.7
mg/dl) with CKD.
Racial Differences in the Prevalence of Inflammatory
Markers by GFR Level
Overall, 20.8% of individuals had detectable CRP levels, and
an additional 7.6% had levels that are considered clinically
elevated (10.0 mg/L). The prevalence of clinically elevated
CRP levels was highest in black individuals (12.2%) and lowest
in white individuals (7.0%). In general, the prevalence of de-
tectable and clinically elevated CRP increased with declining
kidney function. The prevalence of clinically elevated CRP was
highest in black individuals at each level of GFR and lowest for
Mexican-American individuals with a GFR 60 ml/min. Mean
values of WBC count followed a similar trend, increasing with
declining GFR for all race groups. However, in contrast to CRP
levels, mean WBC levels were highest for Mexican-American
individuals and lowest for black individuals with CKD.
Multivariate Models of MI
Results from the logistic regression analyses are illustrated in
Table 2. In univariate analysis, white individuals with reduced
kidney function experienced higher odds of MI (odds ratio

m2, respectively) compared with those with normal kidney
function (GFR 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2; referent OR 1.00). The
univariate associations for black (OR 1.00, 3.91, and 10.50, re-
spectively) and Mexican-American individuals (OR 1.00, 4.16,
and 9.74, respectively) were similar in magnitude to those of
white individuals.
With adjustment for traditional CV risk factors, the magnitude
of the association of GFR with MI was greatly diminished in each
respective racial/ethnic category. Among white individuals, the
estimates were 1.00 (referent), 1.06, and 2.05 for the GFR ranges of
90, 60 to 89, and 60 ml/min. The patterns of association were
similar in black (1.00, 1.47, and 1.64, respectively) and Mexican-
American (1.00, 1.63, and 1.67 respectively) individuals. Overall,
the discrimination index of the models was excellent, ranging
from 82.1% in white individuals to 86.8% in black individuals.
Furthermore, in the fully adjusted model, in which we included
additional covariates that represented CRP and WBC count, the
associations of GFR with MI in each group were virtually un-
changed and the c-statistic showed no further improvement.
The conjoint associations of race and GFR with likelihood of MI
are demonstrated in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. In univariate
analysis, Mexican-American individuals with a GFR of 60 to 89
and 60/ml per min had more than four times and nine times the
odds of MI, respectively, compared with the referent category
(Mexican-American individuals with GFR 90 ml/min, OR 1.00).
For black individuals, the likelihood of MI at each GFR category
were 1.6, 6.1, and 16 times higher than the referent, whereas for
white individuals, the corresponding odds were 1.9, 4.7, and 20
times higher, respectively. With adjustment for traditional risk
factors and inflammatory markers, the magnitude and strength of
these associations were substantially reduced in white and black
individuals and were completely abolished in Mexican-American
individuals (Figure 4).

Discussion
This study highlights substantial differences in the preva-
lence of coronary disease among race groups with reduced
kidney function in the adult US population. As GFR declined,
the prevalence of MI increased disproportionately among
white, black, and Mexican-American individuals. Within GFR
category, overall MI prevalence was significantly lower in Mex-
ican-American compared with black or white individuals, and
these differences were most pronounced among those with
GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, currently classified as having
CKD. Moreover, the finding of lower prevalence of MI in
Mexican-American individuals despite having an excess of sev-
eral traditional risk factors was consistent with what literature
has labeled the "Hispanic paradox" (32). Finally, our study
found that a large percentage of coronary disease in black and
white individuals with reduced kidney function was accounted
for by traditional risk factors, and an even larger percentage

that was found in Mexican-American individuals was ex-
plained by these same risk factors. These observations suggest
that whereas declining kidney function is accompanied by in-
creasing prevalence of coronary disease and associated risk
factors in all race groups, Mexican-American individuals seem
to be protected despite their unfavorable CV profiles.
Recent studies have demonstrated a graded association of
reduced kidney function with increased CV risk, suggesting
that loss of renal function in itself may independently predict
CV outcomes (33­36). Many of these studies have focused on
the magnitude of risk in diverse populations and its prognostic
importance. An unanswered question, however, is whether CV
risk profiles among individuals with reduced GFR differ by
race and whether such differences contribute to clinically im-
portant differences in CV disease prevalence. In this analysis of
NHANES data, we demonstrated that although a reduction in
GFR was associated with increased coronary prevalence, sig-
nificant race differences were found. We speculated that these
differences might be accounted for by differential increases
either in traditional risk factors or in inflammatory factors.
Surprising, the prevalence of several Framingham risk factors
was higher in Mexican-American individuals or at least equal
to those in black or in white individuals, especially among
those with CKD. Diabetes and physical inactivity were far more
prevalent in Hispanic individuals with CKD. Moreover, hyper-
tension as defined by history or by BP measurements and
obesity as defined by elevated body mass index or increased
waist circumference were higher or equal to those of other race
groups. These observations are consistent with the theory that
Mexican-American individuals, despite having adverse CV risk
profiles, especially with regard to the distribution of traditional
risk factors, have "paradoxically" better CV outcomes
(8­10,37).
The low prevalence of coronary disease among Mexican-
American individuals compared with other race groups also
may reflect favorable distributions of some traditional risk fac-
tors. First, nonsmokers were more common among Mexican-
American individuals with CKD than other racial groups.
Mean values for total serum cholesterol also were significantly
lower in Hispanic individuals. Perhaps even more important,
mean values for non-HDL cholesterol, a more accurate measure
of atherogenic lipoprotein burden, were lower in the Mexican-
American individuals with CKD compared with their counter-
parts. Finally, CRP, an emerging nontraditional CV risk factor,
was lower in Mexican-American individuals than in other race
groups in the CKD setting. The combined contributions of these
favorable risk profiles may reflect in part a lower disease bur-
den in Mexican-American individuals and protect against fu-
ture CV events.
In the general population, conflicting opinions exist as to
whether Mexican-American individuals are at greater or lesser
risk for CV disease compared with other racial groups. On the
one hand, data from some cohort studies have demonstrated
higher incidence rates of CV events among Hispanic individu-
als, findings that certainly are consistent with their adverse CV
risk profiles (38­41). On the other hand, recent comparisons of
CV risk indicators have found lower levels of carotid intima
media thickness and lower coronary calcium scores in Mexican-
American individuals compared with non-Hispanic white in-
dividuals, findings that favor CV protection (42,43). However,
unlike the general population, individuals with reduced kidney
function have considerably increased CV risk. Whether find-
ings in the general population can be extended to those with
reduced kidney function is not entirely clear. Our analysis
found lower prevalence of clinical coronary disease among
Mexican-American individuals with CKD compared with black
or white individuals and is consistent with the theory of CV
protection as proposed in the general population. It is unclear,
however, whether this observation represents low incident
rates of coronary disease as a result of favorable distribution of
CV risk factors or even high mortality rates from fatal coronary
disease, which also could lead to the same result as suggested
in a recent paper by Muntner et al. (35).
This study has several limitations. First, the principal out-
come was based on self-report, whereby individuals were in-
formed by their physician of the diagnosis with potential for
recall and misclassification bias. Racial differences in knowl-
edge of MI could bias the reported prevalence. The requirement
that a diagnosis of MI be made by a physician should narrow
the variability in knowledge between racial groups, although
racial differences in help-seeking patterns and access to care
remained. The prevalence of angina showed a significantly
higher prevalence in minority groups than in white individual,
suggesting that the true prevalence of MI may be biased down-
ward in minority group. Although no validation studies were
conducted independently for self-reported disease in the
NHANES, previous validation studies in equally large samples
have found that self-report captures 60 to 75% of MI (44­46).
Furthermore, although this may result in a nondifferential mis-
classification of MI, it usually underestimates rather than over-
estimates the true OR.
Second, kidney function was estimated using the MDRD
formula, a prediction equation that was developed in individ-
uals with reduced kidney function and consisted only of white
and black individuals (29). Although we assumed that Mexi-
can-American individuals are similar to white individuals
when estimating GFR using this equation, future studies are
required to confirm this. Furthermore, this equation's accuracy
is greatest among those with moderate reductions in kidney
function and is less precise for predicting GFR at higher levels
(47). Third, despite the oversampling of minorities in NHANES
III, sufficient numbers were not available to assess prevalence
estimates in GFR categories of 30 and 15 ml/min. Finally,
the cross-sectional design of the NHANES study limited causal
inference. The findings from this cross-sectional analysis, how-
ever, provide important information for the design of future
longitudinal studies.
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study has several
strengths. First, it is the most comprehensive national survey to
estimate coronary disease prevalence among race groups with
reduced kidney function. Second, the oversampling of minority
groups in NHANES III allowed for accurate estimation of dis-
ease prevalence for all race groups by GFR. Third, the avail-
ability of extensive and complete data on a range of CV risk
J Am Soc Nephrol 17: 1716­1723, 2006 Ethnic Disparities in Coronary Disease in CKD 1721
factors, both traditional and inflammatory, allowed us to assess
their combined associations with coronary disease.
This study highlights significant differences in the prevalence
of clinical coronary disease among race groups in the adult US
population with reduced kidney function. Although the prev-
alence increased with declining kidney function in each group,
increases were lowest in Mexican-American individuals. It is
plausible that favorable distributions of some traditional and
novel risk factors accounted for the lower prevalence in Mexi-
can-American individuals compared with other race groups.
These results support the continuing Hispanic paradox of CV
protection in Hispanic individuals with CKD that is seen in the
general population despite adverse CV risk profiles. Future
studies should assess whether these findings translate into
fewer CV events for Mexican-American individuals using pro-
spectively designed cohorts.
