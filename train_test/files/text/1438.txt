Bate et al [1] present stimulating work on
the seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus
(CMV) in the United States during 2 pe-
riods, 1988­1994 and 1999­2004, which
showed that the prevalence of CMV in-
fection remained stable between these 2
periods. Such studies are rare, and many
countries clearly lack epidemiologic data.
The past decade has seen numerous stud-
ies of the management and consequences
of CMV infection during pregnancy, but
most of these studies were heterogeneous
and based on small numbers of patients.
More recent studies have sought to eval-
uate prevention strategies [2, 3] and treat-
ments [4, 5], whereas others have focused
on vaccine development [6]. Both options
are important and certainly not mutually
exclusive.
Bate et al [1] remind us, "Compared
with a maternal nonprimary infection
(i.e., reinfection or reactivation), a mater-
nal primary infection is more likely to
transmit CMV from mother to fetus (1%
vs. 32%)" (p. 1439). We must note, how-

ever, that 32% is a mother-to-fetus trans-
mission rate, whereas 1% is an estimated
incidence of the infected children born to
mothers with preexisting immunity before
pregnancy. These rates are therefore dif-
ficult to compare. Although a diagnosis of
primary infection during pregnancy is re-
liable, the diagnosis of recurrent infection
is much more questionable. Most studies
base a diagnosis of recurrent infection on
an increase of immunoglobulin (Ig) G
(with high IgG avidity) or the presence of
IgM antibodies or both. These findings
can also be found in other clinical situa-
tions, such as nonspecific stimulation of
the immune system, maternal autoim-
mune disorders, and other cross-reacting
herpetic infections. In addition, in some
studies, CMV detection in urine or cer-
vical samples in women who were CMV
seropositive before pregnancy is also de-
fined as recurrent infection [7, 8].
Another unresolved question about re-
current infections is whether transplacen-
tal transmission of CMV in women with
preexisting immunity is most often sec-
ondary to reactivation or to infection with
a different CMV strain during pregnancy.
Reactivation is the reappearance of the en-
dogenous CMV strain acquired before
pregnancy and would be mainly local: in
the macrophages of the uterus [8], in the
cervix, and in the kidneys, leading to ma-
ternal viruria. Such local reactivation is
unlikely to be linked with maternal vire-
mia. Unless reactivation occurs in the
uterus, the risk of fetal infection appears
highly improbable. Reinfection, on the
other hand, is infection with a new viral
strain. Reinfection is thought to lead to
maternal viremia and eventually to fetal
infection. In both cases (reactivation and
reinfection), it is difficult to investigate the
kinetics of humoral immune response.
Novak et al [9] developed a novel ap-
proach to diagnosis of reinfection based
on the appearance of new antibody spec-
ificity against at least 1 of 4 polymorphic
epitopes designed from 2 prototypic lab-
oratory strains of CMV (AD169 and
Towne). This procedure made it possible
to show that reinfection with a different
strain of CMV can lead to intrauterine
transmission and symptomatic congenital
infection [10]. Investigators estimate the
annual incidence rate of reinfection at
10% in populations with a high CMV se-
roprevalence, which are thus at high risk
of CMV infection during pregnancy [11,
12]. However, the recombinant antigens
described herein failed to detect up to one-
third of the CMV-seropositive individuals
in their population, that is, up to one-third
of CMV strains. Accordingly, they can give
us only a general idea of the incidence of
reinfections during pregnancy, but it is not

known how many women will have a re-
activation during pregnancy, how many
will have infected infants, and what the
consequences of this congenital infection
will be. Before we can learn these things,
the diagnosis of both reinfection and re-
activation during pregnancy must be im-
proved, along with our understanding of
the mechanisms leading to intrauterine
CMV transmission and congenital infec-
tion in infants born to women with pre-
existing immunity.
Maternal antibodies to CMV before
conception provide substantial protection
to the fetus against congenital damage
from maternal infection [13]: primary
maternal infection during pregnancy is as-
sociated with more severe sequelae of con-
genital CMV infection, even though the
frequency may not differ. A study of hear-
ing loss, for example, found the prevalence
in children born to mothers with non-
primary infection (10%) was similar to
that in those with primary infection (11%)
but also that significantly more children
in the primary infection group had pro-
gressive and severe or profound hearing
loss compared with children in the non-
primary group [14].
Child-to-mother CMV transmission in
seronegative pregnant women with young
children can probably be prevented by hy-
gienic intervention [2, 3], and treatments
are under evaluation for pregnant women
who have acquired a primary CMV in-
fection during pregnancy (CMV hyper-
immune globulin, valacyclovir) [4, 5, 15].
What kind of prevention is possible for
the population with a preconceptional
CMV immunity? A vaccine is probably
not an effective option in this population.
Hygiene counseling and sexual advice dur-
ing pregnancy may well be the most cost-
effective solution. Again, Bate et al [1]
have pertinent epidemiologic informa-
tion. They describe the population at high
risk of developing CMV infection during
pregnancy, that is, nonwhite women with
low socioeconomic statuses and low ed-
ucation levels. They report that nearly all
non-Hispanic black women who are CMV
seronegative during their teen years sero-
convert by the time they are in their 30s--
that is, still during the reproductive period.
However, most congenital CMVinfections
in the United States result from recurrent
infections among pregnant women. This
proportion is likely to be even higher in
countries with higher CMV seropreva-
lence. Therefore, all women would bene-
fit from hygiene counseling throughout
pregnancy.
Regardless of maternal immune sta-
tus, CMV infection during pregnancy re-
mains a global public health problem. All
of the strategies discussed herein--hy-
giene counseling, new treatment, and vac-
cine development--must be developed in
combination to decrease the burden of
this infection.
