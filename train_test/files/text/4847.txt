Datafication and empowerment: How the
open data movement re-articulates
notions of democracy, participation,
and journalism
Stefan Baack
Abstract
This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate notions of democracy, participation, and
journalism by applying practices and values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on
the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues
that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied
publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating
knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should
break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data
about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by
applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermedi-
aries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to
become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic
technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open
data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help
to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business.

Introduction
Agency is deeply connected to the distribution of know-
ledge and power. If we understand agency as `the longer
processes of action based on reflection, giving an
account of what one has done, even more basically,
making sense of the world so as to act within it'
(Couldry, 2014: 891), then the conditions under which
we can make sense of our world and our own actions
are crucial for our capacity to act with agency. With the
expansion of the Internet, social media, and Big Data
technologies, we can currently observe a number of
fundamental transformations of knowledge production
and distribution that raise urgent questions about
public agency. To date, however, questions about
agency have been `obscured by unnecessarily
generalised readings' (Couldry and Powell, 2014: 1) of
the supposed power of the new technologies. For this
reason, Couldry and Powell (2014) recently called for
`social analytics' as a new research paradigm in relation
to Big Data.1 They stress that agency is still relevant
and that we should study new forms of reflexive agency
in increasingly datafied societies. This involves paying
more attention to the social and cultural dimension of

this transformation by examining how social actors
respond to processes of data collection and analysis
and how they use data to `meet their own ends'
(Couldry, 2014: 892). This article follows Couldry and
Powell's call and shows how activism around open data
is a rich, but so far largely overlooked side of inquiry
that allows us to think about the relationship between
data and agency in new ways.
The open data movement is a particularly interesting
case because it intersects with two ongoing transform-
ations of knowledge and power that seem to contradict
each other in terms of agency: datafication and the pro-
liferation of hacking or open source culture. On the one
hand, the practices and imaginaries of open data activ-
ists are centered around the distribution and use of data
and thus linked to datafication, the ubiquitous quanti-
fication of social life (Mayer-Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier,
2013: 78), for which Big Data is the most prominent
expression. Big Data `reframes key questions about the
constitution of knowledge' (Boyd and Crawford, 2012:
665) and raises concerns about the agency of publics.
As Couldry and Powell (2014: 4) note, Big Data tech-
nologies and the growing relevance of algorithms may
disconnect `system and experience' because the traces of
data people leave behind are often unconscious and not
meaningful to them, and the insights generated by com-
panies or governments are not, or only partially,
`folded back into the experience of everyday life'. The
comprehensive surveillance of online activities made
possible by Big Data technologies thus might impede
our potential to act in an agentic manner. On the other
hand, open data activists apply practices and values
from open source culture to the creation and use of
data. This links them to other initiatives rooted in
open source culture, like Open Access, Wikipedia,
Wikileaks, Anonymous or Creative Commons (Beyer,
2014a, 2014b; Coleman, 2014; Sauter, 2014). Similar to
datafication, these phenomena raise fundamental ques-
tions about `the nature of knowledge and expertise,
how information is organized and evaluated, and who
decides' (Lievrouw, 2011: 26). Different to datafication,
however, open source culture is associated with a trans-
parent and collaborative form of governance that might
support agency. As Raymond (2001) famously pointed
out when he contrasted the `bazaar model' of open
source with the `cathedral approach', open source cul-
ture is fundamentally concerned with the rights to
access and distribute knowledge. Open source is based
on voluntary participation (Weber, 2004: 62) and col-
laboration, granting access to the source code of soft-
ware and incorporating contributions from potentially
everyone. The implications of transferring the `open
source process' (Weber, 2004: 16) and the values inher-
ent in this process to new domains with different ways
of organizing knowledge `reach directly into the heart
of the legitimacy, certainty, reliability and especially the
finality and temporality of the knowledge and infra-
structures we collectively create' (Kelty, 2008: 6­7).
An analysis of the open data movement offers a
unique opportunity to connect datafication and open
source culture, which raises interesting questions
about agency: how do activists apply practices and
values from open source culture to data, and what
does this tell us, in return, about agency in datafied
publics? To address these questions, I will present key
findings from a study on the Open Knowledge
Foundation Germany (OKF DE), a not-for-profit
organization and one of the most influential and visible
actors in the German open data movement.2 First, I
will address how we can trace the influence of open
source culture on open data activists. This will be the
foundation for the following analysis, in which I will
show how open data activists modulate open source
practices by applying them to data. Inspired by the
social analytics approach, this analysis will ask, first,
what their practices and imaginaries tell us about the
conditions under which datafication might support the
agency of publics and, second, how datafication sup-
ports the agency of activists themselves. In the conclu-
sion, I will reflect on the broader relevance of this type
of activism for the ongoing datafication of social life.
Tracing the influence of open source
culture on open data activists
It is generally acknowledged that activism around open
data is rooted in hacking culture (cf. Bates, 2012;
Davies, 2010; Johnson, 2014), or more specifically
open source culture as one of the most prominent
genres of hacking (Coleman and Golub, 2008).
However, while this connection is frequently pointed
out, it is rarely examined in more detail. Authors usu-
ally refer to a set of broad ethical commitments taken
directly from traditional hacker culture. These ethical
commitments have been famously described by Levy
(1984) as follows: access to computer technology and
information should be free, centralized forms of power
are rejected in favor of decentralization, hackers adhere
to a meritocratic culture of technological excellence in
which the hacker should only be judged by his or her
code, and the belief that computers can create a `better
world'. While these principles are indeed relevant, we
run the risk of oversimplifying the relationship between
open data activism and open source culture if we solely
rely on them. As Coleman (2013: 17) points out, the
frequent reference to Levy's account is problematic
because it `whitewashes' the diversity among hackers.
While hackers share some technical and ethical com-
mitments (for which Levy's description is still useful),
hacker culture should not be treated as a `singular code
2 Big Data & Society
formulated by some homogeneous group called hackers
but instead as a composite of distinct yet connected
moral genres' (Coleman, 2013: 19).
To develop a more nuanced and differentiated picture
of how open data activists draw from open source cul-
ture, we can turn to research on its broader cultural sig-
nificance and influence beyond software development.
Particularly helpful here is an approach developed by
Kelty (2008). While most attempts to grasp this phenom-
enon are primarily interested in making generaliza-
tions--for example by asking whether diverse
initiatives rooted in open source culture are forming a
coherent movement with a political project (cf. Beyer,
2014b; Clement and Hurrell, 2008; Kapczynski and
Krikorian, 2010) or how the organizational features of
open source software development can be generalized
and applied to new domains (cf. Demil and Lecocq,
2006; Matei and Irimia, 2014; Weber, 2004)--Kelty
developed a model that can be used to trace the influence
of open source culture for specific cases. In his study of
the cultural significance of free software,3 Kelty suggests
that open source advocates associate with each other not
just through a set of ethical commitments, but through a
range of key practices and social imaginaries (Taylor,
2004). He understands open source as an experimental
system made up of five key practices or `components':
sharing source code, defining openness, writing copy-
right licenses, coordinating collaborations, and forming
a movement. Understood in this way, open source
becomes `a system of thresholds, not of classification'
(Kelty, 2008: 16):
Within each component are a range of differences in
practice, from conventional to experimental. At the
center, so to speak, are the most common and accepted
versions of a practice; at the edges are more unusual or
controversial versions. (Kelty, 2008: 15)
Due to their flexibility, these components are not
exclusive to the development of software: each of
these practices can be adapted or `modulated' to
apply them to other domains. Therefore, Kelty (2008:
246) calls initiatives like Wikipedia or Creative
Commons modulations of open source that emerge
`out of a direct engagement with and exploration of
Free Software' and are `committed to experimenting
with the given practices of Free Software'. Creative
Commons, for example, paralleled some of the work
of the Free Software Foundation in a different context
(Garcelon, 2009: 1315): it modulates the practice of
`sharing source code' by applying it to `content', it is
writing copyright licenses for this new type of `source
code', and it has become a movement as well.
To trace the influence of open source culture, Kelty
(2008: 278) suggests treating its key practices as a
template that interacts with other forms of knowledge
management: `Where the practices match, no change
occurs, and where they don't, it is the reorientation
of knowledge and power'. Therefore, the proliferation
of open source culture can be described as the prolifer-
ation and modulation of its key practices in order
to alter the means of knowledge production and circu-
lation. Tracing the influence of open source culture
on open data activists then comes down to a set of
specific questions: Which practices are modulated?
How are they modulated? How does this change the
domain to which they are applied? Answering these
questions will help us to grasp how activists try to
apply the more transparent and collaborative forms
of governance associated with open source to politics,
and how this might support the agency of datafied
publics.
Practices and imaginaries of open data
activists4
The following analysis is based on 10 semi-structured
interviews with members of the OKF DE core team
(including the chairman and founder, main developers,
committee members and project managers) and a con-
tent analysis of nine relevant documents that were
selected using a theoretical sampling, for example self-
portraying descriptions from the official homepage. The
data was collected in three rounds between September
2012 and January 2013 and analyzed using a grounded
theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). I will
structure the presentation of the findings in a way
that shows how one modulation of open source culture
leads activists to other, subsequent adaptations and
interpretations.
1. By regarding data as a prerequisite for generating
knowledge, activists transform the sharing of
source code to include the sharing of raw data.
Sharing raw data would allow others to make their
own interpretation of it and generate their own
knowledge, which represents a `democratization of
information' for activists.
2. Seeing information as a necessary precondition for
political participation, activists connect this idea to
an open and flexible form of representative democ-
racy by applying the open source model of partici-
pation (the `bazaar model') to political participation,
which should lead to more participation of citizens
in political decision-making processes and more
active and engaged local communities.
3. A third set of practices refers to activists' acknow-
ledgment that raw data needs to be `refined' to create
knowledge for citizens, which is why they seek to
create, and become, `data intermediaries' for the
Baack 3
public. This leads them to a special interest in
journalism.
In the following, I explain each of these modulations
and their implications in more detail.
Raw data as source code
The overall mission of the Open Knowledge Foundation is
already implicated in its name. The organization adapts a
hierarchical understanding of the relationship between data,
information, and knowledge that is common in knowledge
management literature (Tuomi, 1999). According to this
model, (raw) data are understood as symbols that have
not been interpreted; data becomes information when it is
structured and put into context; and information
becomes knowledge when it is interpreted, meaningful,
and actionable. As the OKF explains, open knowledge
`is what open data becomes when it's useful, usable and
used' (Open Knowledge, n.d. a). With its name, the
OKF thus indicates that it aims at spreading not just
open data, but open knowledge. However, data is seen
as a prerequisite for generating knowledge. This hier-
archical understanding leads activists to the first and
most fundamental modulation of open source culture:
to conceive raw data as source code that should be
shared openly to allow others to interpret it and to
generate their own knowledge from it.
Implicit here is that activists do not simply modulate
the practice of sharing source code by replacing code
with data. They also adapt the metaphors and concepts
behind this practice. To execute human-readable source
code on a computer, it has to be translated into binary
instructions that are only readable by machines. These
binary instructions cannot be retranslated back into the
source code from which they have been generated.
Having only the binary code without the source code
(which is the case for most proprietary software) means
that it is not possible to understand or modify the `inner
workings' of the software. Similarly, open data activists
treat raw data as source code and interpretations--or
knowledge--as binary code. As one activist explains,
raw data `is not really neutral' but it allows more inter-
pretation than a `summary or a press conference'
(Interview: Developer 1).5 That is because summaries
are already interpretations of raw data. Only offering
an interpretation of raw data without allowing access to
it would make it difficult for others to understand how
this interpretation was developed. Governments would
then maintain a `monopoly of interpretation'. Sharing
raw data makes the process of interpreting it transpar-
ent and breaks governments' monopoly, which means
that everybody could make his or her own interpret-
ation of the data that governments use to make and
justify their decisions--allowing people to examine
biases in government's data collection and interpret-
ation. For activists, open data therefore represents a
democratization of interpretation or--as they put
it--a `democratization of information' (Interview:
Chairman & Founder).
It is interesting to contrast the notion of `raw data'
developed by activists with the way the term is used in
discussions about Big Data. `Raw data is an oxymoron'
(Gitelman, 2013) is one of the most common critiques
of Big Data advocates' belief in `objective quantifica-
tion' (Van Dijck, 2014: 198) or Big Data's `aura of
truth, objectivity, and accuracy' (Boyd and Crawford,
2012: 664). In their critique, authors point out that data
is always prefigured through gathering mechanisms
(Van Dijck and Poell, 2013: 10) and collected data
has to be interpreted to make it meaningful and action-
able, a process guided by specific interests and ration-
alities and not something that can be considered as
objective. Essentially, this questions whether something
like `raw' data actually exists when we understand it as
something `pure' beyond human influence. However,
members of the OKF DE adapt a different understand-
ing of `raw' data. For them, `raw' simply means `as
collected'. Accordingly, sharing data in `raw'
form--`as collected'--is not about revealing an
unbiased and objective truth, but about making the
biases of this data transparent and allowing `more inter-
pretation of truth' (Interview: Chairman & Founder).
Using this understanding as a basis, members of the
OKF DE are also concerned with the conditions that
must be met to ensure this type of transparency,
i.e. with the way raw data has to be provided to fulfill
their vision of a democratization of information. This
leads them to another modulation of open source prac-
tices: defining openness. More specifically, they define
both the legal and technical characteristics of openness
in relation to data in order to delineate open data from
`closed' data. For legal openness, the OKF developed
the international Open Definition (Open Knowledge,
n.d. b), according to which data is `open' when it can
be accessed, modified and shared by anyone for any pur-
pose without restrictions. Technical openness is about
ensuring that these rights can be exercised without too
much effort. Key here are the principles developed by the
Sunlight Foundation (2010) and the rating system devel-
oped by Tim Berners-Lee (2010). According to these
guidelines, datasets should be complete, released in a
timely fashion, accessible, machine readable, and avail-
able in open formats. While activists acknowledge that
personal data and data crucial to security should not be
made available in this way, they suggest that these legal
and technical conditions are necessary to effectively
break the interpretative monopoly of governments.
Given the importance of knowledge for agency, this
type of transparency has the potential to support the
4 Big Data & Society
agency of datafied publics. As activists acknowledge
themselves, however, the mere provision of raw data
is insufficient and only represents `the first step'
(Interview: Chairman & Founder). As I will explain
in the following sections, this provision should go
along with more continuous and flexible forms of par-
ticipation and `data intermediaries' that make raw data
accessible to the public.
Data and democracy
The democratization of information described above is
not regarded as an end in itself by activists. Ultimately,
this form of transparency is taken as a means through
which `the people should be considered again as the
sovereign' (Interview: Project Manager 1). Even
though they do not explicitly talk about agency them-
selves, activists' articulations of their broader aims are
interesting for understanding how and under what con-
ditions the democratization of information they envi-
sion could support the agency of datafied publics. The
overall `vision' of OKF DE members is essentially a
vision of citizen empowerment: sharing raw data
should help citizens to better understand and control
their governments and to be more active and engaged in
their local communities.
This means that more possibilities for citizens to par-
ticipate in political decision-making processes is a
major goal for members of the OKF DE: `to partici-
pate, people need information' (Interview: Project
Manager 2). In this respect, they regard themselves as
part of an `Internet generation' that is not content with
periodic voting: `[I want] a higher degree of participa-
tion . . . a more continuous form of participation'
(Interview: Committee member). This does not, how-
ever, necessarily translate into a demand for more
direct democracy. Instead, the open source model of
participation is taken as a paradigm:
What is powerful about open source development is
that people can elect themselves as participants. I
mean people can find my project and then decide for
themselves to participate in its development and con-
tribute to it. I think this model of self-selective partici-
pation is extremely powerful and I believe it can be
applied to politics. (Interview: Developer 1)
This means that everybody who wants to participate
in the decision-making process of a particular issue
should have the opportunity to do so in a meaningful
way. Here, activists explicitly modulate another prac-
tice from open source culture: coordinating collabor-
ations, the organization of open source projects
(Kelty, 2008, ch. 7). As mentioned above, this organ-
izational model has been described as the `bazaar
model' (Raymond, 2001) because it encourages and
incorporates contributions from potentially everyone.
Just as there is not one standard model for coordinating
collaborations in open source--larger and more well-
known projects like the Linux kernel, the Apache ser-
vers, or the Debian project have all developed distinct
organizational models over time (Coleman, 2013;
Kelty, 2008; Weber, 2004)--activists reject clearly pre-
scribing a specific model of participation. For them,
applying the bazaar model of open source to govern-
ance is first and foremost about experimentation. There
will not be `this one solution that you just need to
apply. I think public authorities will need to have the
courage to experiment' (Interview: Chairman &
Founder). This illustrates that more participation is
not seen as a natural outcome of open data. Activists
argue that it requires a cultural change within public
institutions: a change towards a `beta culture' that is
willing to experiment and risk failure (Schwegmann,
2012), and a more collaborative and less authoritative
relationship with citizens. Public institutions, it is
argued, should promote the use of data and actively
include citizens in decision-making processes: `It is
not just about opening data. . .but also about invest-
ments from public institutions to ensure that this data
is used' (Interview: Committee member). Activists
think that this cultural change will mainly happen at
a local level, where issues are `closer' to the people and
institutions can experiment with `less resources'
(Interview: Chairman & Founder).
Taken together, the way activists apply the open
source model of participation to governance results
in a notion of a more open and flexible form of repre-
sentative democracy. `Open' refers to a higher degree of
transparency (by sharing raw data) and the openness of
political decision-making processes for public participa-
tion. `Flexible' means that activists think that the inclu-
sion and coordination of citizens' voluntary, `self-
selective participation' should be adapted to the issue
at hand and to the local context. At the same time,
activists do not question representative democracy as
such and are rather skeptical about elements of direct
democracy, e.g. referendums: `I don't know if direct
democracy is always the right answer . . . but
I definitely want more mechanisms to involve people
more often' (Interview: Chairman & Founder). From
the perspective of democratic theory, they negotiate
between representative models of democracy--in
which participation is mainly limited to periodic voting
--and direct models of democracy, where entire elect-
orates vote on certain proposals. This is similar to
Barber's (2004) model of `strong democracy', a more
explicit attempt to develop an alternative to represen-
tative and direct democracy. Put briefly, strong democ-
racy is based on a `creative consensus' that is meant to
Baack 5
recognize the diversity of interests and `is premised on
citizens' active and perennial participation in the trans-
formation of conflict through the creation of common
consciousness and political judgment' (Barber, 2004:
224). Similarly, the diverse and flexible modes of orga-
nizing voluntary participation envisioned by OKF DE
members require the active involvement of citizens and
imply a consensus building process that is `creative' in
negotiating diverse interests and in its organization.
We can summarize the ideas and aims of open data
activists described thus far to articulate--as an inter-
mediary result--a first proposal about the conditions
that must be met to support the agency of datafied
publics: the transparency created through the sharing
of raw data should be accompanied by a cultural
change within public institutions to support voluntary
and flexible forms of participation similar to those
found in open source projects. As I will detail in the
next section, activists not only emphasize the import-
ance of public institutions, but also of other intermedi-
aries to facilitate this participation.
Creating empowering intermediaries:
Complementing or replacing journalism?
Even though the idea behind the democratization of
information is to potentially allow everybody to inter-
pret raw data, activists are well aware that the average
citizen does not have the time and expert knowledge to
do so. They recognize that their vision of empowerment
through open data can only be realized with intermedi-
aries that make raw data accessible to the public.6
Different to the modulations discussed above, this is
not directly reflected by open source culture.
However, it emerged out of activists' engagement,
exploration, and modulation of open source, i.e. of
modulating the sharing of source code to include the
sharing of raw data and of using the open source model
of participation as a paradigm for political participa-
tion. Because activists realize the importance of suitable
intermediaries for their goals, they actively seek to
`create' them--which makes this aspect also interesting
for understanding how datafication supports the
agency of activists themselves.
In terms of agency, more interesting than the basic
acknowledgment that intermediaries are necessary is
what kind of intermediaries are deemed necessary to
empower citizens. Three criteria can be identified that
constitute an `empowering intermediary' in the eyes of
activists. First, they should be data-driven, which means
that they should be able to handle large and complex
datasets to make them accessible to others. Second,
empowering intermediaries should be open, which
means that they should make the data from which
they generate stories or build applications available to
their audiences--the principle of sharing raw data
applies here as well. The fact that professional journal-
ists or NGOs often do not give access to their sources is
therefore frequently criticized, one activist calling it a
`fundamental bug of newspapers' (Interview: Developer
1). Third, empowering intermediaries should be enga-
ging, which means that they should actively involve
citizens in public issues. This implies that such interme-
diaries should not only be information providers and
that they should have a cooperative relationship with
their audiences: `journalism also needs to change to be
closer to citizens' (Interview: Developer 2). Taken
together, the three criteria articulated by activists are
clearly related to their goal of an open and flexible
democracy described above. Empowering intermedi-
aries are a necessary prerequisite in this sense, or, as
we might say in relation to agency, they are important
supporters of agency in datafied publics.
To `create' these intermediaries, activists try to
cooperate with other NGOs and professional journalists
and offer teaching. Here, they are part of a larger phe-
nomenon: the increased interaction between the social
worlds of technology and journalism, or more specific-
ally between hackers and journalists (Karlsen and
Stavelin, 2014; Lewis and Usher, 2013; Parasie and
Dagiral, 2013; Royal, 2010). Members of the OKF DE
are involved, for example, in Hacks/Hackers events
(Lewis and Usher, 2014), where hackers and journalists
come together to innovate news; the News Challenge of
the Knight Foundation, an open-to-all contest reward-
ing projects that aim to transform news and information
distribution (Lewis, 2012a); or the Knight-Mozilla
Fellowships, which bring together hackers and technolo-
gists `to spend 10 months working on open source code
with partner newsroom[s]' like The New York Times or
Der Spiegel (OpenNews, n.d.). The existing research on
the interaction between these groups shows that activ-
ists' goal of a more equal and cooperative relationship
between citizens and professional journalists essentially
questions the professional boundaries of journalism. As
Lewis (2012b) describes, journalism is shaped by a pro-
fessional logic of (exclusive) control over content that
does not align easily with a more participatory form of
journalism favored by activists. The research shows an
ongoing process of negotiation of different values,
imaginations, and practices: news organizations try to
re-interpret the distinct way activists think about tech-
nology and data `into the language of news' (Lewis and
Usher, 2013: 604), while at least some activists tend to
believe the new possibilities are `capable of altering the
very nature of journalism' (Parasie, 2011).
However, activists do not only try to influence jour-
nalism by interacting with professional journalists or by
becoming programmer-journalists in newsrooms. They
also act as intermediaries outside the profession and
6 Big Data & Society
develop independent, non-profit applications to `imple-
ment' their ideas. Key here are so called `civic techno-
logies'--small-scale, specialized applications that aim
to `connect people' (Interview: Developer 1). These
applications are either about improving government
services for citizens, or about helping citizens to coord-
inate with each other to solve problems together. Often
these are relatively simple web applications that focus
on one task. For example, there are civic technologies
that help people to exchange deposit bottles, that show
how and where to engage in local building projects, that
inform people about the local air quality, visualize
which parts of the city are barrier-free and which are
not, and so forth.7 Even though civic technologies do
not always depend on open data, data is key to their
functioning in two ways: first, the availability of open
data creates more opportunities to develop civic tech-
nologies (for example, when they require traffic data);
second, they often datafy the activities they are con-
cerned with, i.e. they often create new data. For exam-
ple, FragDenStaat.de (inspired by the British
WhatDoTheyKnow8) makes it easier to submit free-
dom of information requests to public authorities and
tracks both the requests and the responses from insti-
tutions. This crowdsourcing approach created a data-
base that can be used to analyze and compare how
different institutions react to these requests, what kind
of requests are more likely to get refused and so forth.
This illustrates that the development of civic technolo-
gies is not only interesting because it could support the
agency of citizens. It also shows how activists use or
create data to meet their own ends by developing tools
to put their ideas into practice. For OKF DE members,
the purpose of these applications is two-fold. On
the one hand, they are supposed to help citizens to be
more active and engaged in their local communities in a
general sense--for example by helping people with dis-
abilities to move around the city. On the other hand,
they hope to create new communities or `alternative
publics . . . with a controlling function' (Interview:
Developer 1). An often cited example is Ushahidi,9
which was originally developed by a group of citizen
journalists to track violent outbreaks after a disputed
election in Kenya (Giridharadas, 2010). Because jour-
nalists received threats about their work, Ushahidi was
designed as a crowdsourcing application that maps
incidents reported anonymously by users. Both in
the sense of more active and engaged citizens and of
`controlling publics', civic technologies are linked to a
notion of `self-empowerment' (Interview: Chairman &
Founder) or `do-it-yourself-empowerment' through
data, understood as the ability of citizens to solve
issues without the help of governments or businesses.
In terms of agency, the development of civic tech-
nologies by activists is interesting for another, less
obvious reason. Civic technologies can be described
as alternative ways of fulfilling functions traditionally
described as `journalistic' (making governments more
transparent and accountable and engaging citizens in
public issues) or of accessing and using public services
(e.g. with an easy-to-use website to submit freedom of
information requests). In other words, these applica-
tions are developed independently outside professional
journalism or public institutions, but at the same time
are trying to fulfill similar functions. This ability to
create `actually existing alternatives' is characteristic
of the political power of hacking in general, as Kelty
(2008) illustrates. He argues that open source advocates
(and modulations like the open data movement) create
independent `recursive publics' through their key
practices:
A recursive public is a public that is vitally concerned
with the material and practical maintenance and modifi-
cation of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual
means of its own existence as a public; it is a collective
independent of other forms of constituted power and is
capable of speaking to existing forms of power through
the production of actually existing alternatives. (Kelty,
2008: 3)
By being able to maintain their own terms of existence
(to a certain degree at least), recursive publics can
act as `actually existing alternatives'. In this sense,
civic technologies developed by activists could to
some degree act as `actually existing alternatives' to
professional journalism or (ways of accessing) public
services. Activists are well aware of this potential: The
ultimate goal of developing alternative services with
civic technologies is to pressure established institutions
to adapt them. `Flagship projects' (Interview:
Chairman & Founder) are intended to demonstrate
what is possible and to invite (or provoke) established
institutions to imitate them. As one member notes: `We
have discovered software as a lobbying tool' (Interview:
Developer 2). Let me illustrate this with another exam-
ple: Frankfurt-Gestalten.de (`Shaping-Frankfurt')
monitors information provided by local parliaments
in the city of Frankfurt and illustrates them on a
map. Users can check what is currently discussed in
their street or district (e.g. building projects), comment
on it or initiate new discussions. Activists use this pro-
ject to advocate for easier access to local parliamentary
data, and for local public institutions to offer similar
services. Moreover, I suggest that applications like
Frankfurt-Gestalten.de represent a data-driven form
of local journalism that is focused on engaging citizens
on a local level. As such, Frankfurt-Gestalten.de has a
complex relationship with professional journalism:
First, it could complement professional journalism
Baack 7
because local journalists can use it as a research tool.
Secondly, however, it also represents a potential threat
for professional local journalism--if people use an
application like Frankfurt-Gestalten.de instead of con-
sulting their local news media. Yet it is also conceiv-
able, thirdly, that news media develop and maintain
similar applications themselves, offering them as ser-
vices to their audience and using them as research
tools for their own investigations--Bell (2014) recently
made a similar suggestion. This example illustrates how
activists attempt to directly or indirectly influence
established institutions on many different levels
through the development of civic technologies, and
shows that acting as intermediaries themselves is as
much about directly putting ideas into practice as it is
about transforming existing institutions. It not only
shows how activists use data to directly meet their
own ends, but also how they attempt to influence the
conditions of the wider public to support the agency of
ordinary citizens.
Conclusion: Data hacking and new
forms of agency?
I conclude by returning to the questions raised in the
beginning of this article. What do the practices and
values developed by members of the OKF DE tell us
about the conditions under which datafication can sup-
port agency?
When we look at activists themselves, datafication
obviously does not undermine, but rather supports
their agency in important ways: their technological
expertise enables them to utilize or create data to
meet their own ends. They even use the applications
they create as lobbying tools that pressure institutions
by offering actually existing alternatives. These findings
emphasize the connection between datafication and the
proliferation of hacking culture. The ability to `hack'
and to create recursive publics fundamentally depends
on the availability and modifiability of the underlying
technology (Kelty, 2008: 10­11): participants have to be
able to access and modify the technology needed to
build their own, independent infrastructures.
Otherwise, the expressive use of technology--the
expression of imaginaries, values and rationalities
through technology--would not be possible. The pro-
cess of `datafying' a phenomenon--of transforming it
into quantifiable information--can be an integral part
of recursive publics in itself, as illustrated by civic tech-
nologies that collect data via crowdsourcing.
More importantly, to datafy a phenomenon is to re-
materialize it into a highly modifiable form: in its
essence, data is structured information that can be ana-
lyzed, edited, and combined with other data. This is
why the availability of data creates more opportunities
for the development of software that utilizes it in new
ways, like activists do with the civic technologies they
create. By rendering phenomena into data that have
never been quantified before, datafication can make
the key practices of recursive publics applicable to
them in ways that have not been possible before--given
that the data created in these processes is accessible and
modifiable. Therefore, datafication also has the poten-
tial to extend both the possibilities for and the scope of
recursive publics, i.e. of creating `actually existing alter-
natives' to established forms of knowledge production
and circulation.
Moreover, members of the OKF DE are primarily
concerned with how they can support democratic
values and the agency of citizens through open data.
As I showed in this article, three interrelated conditions
must be met in their eyes: raw data should be shared
openly to make decision-making processes more trans-
parent, public institutions should actively include citi-
zens in these decision-making processes to create a
more open and flexible form of representative democ-
racy, and `empowering intermediaries' are needed to
make raw data accessible to the wider public. It seems
clear that these propositions have a potential to remedy
the issues identified by Couldry and Powell (2014), i.e.
the danger that Big Data technologies undermine agency
by disconnecting system and experience. However, it is
of course important and necessary to critically examine
these ideas. For example, how to ensure that the raw
data provided by governments does not violate privacy
and is free of manipulations? Can voluntary participa-
tion of citizens work at larger scales? How to ensure that
these processes do not end up `empowering the empow-
ered' (Gurstein, 2011)? We also need to be wary about
the idealism of activists and the high level of technical
literacy required to get involved in data activism. It
might be easy to criticize activists as naive or techno-
deterministic when we point out all these potential
issues. However, while there is much to be critical of, I
suggest that it is equally important to study and under-
stand the practices and ideas of activists in order to
evaluate what we can learn from them. Activists aim
to develop new rationalities and alternative social ima-
ginaries around datafication to connect system and
experience in new ways and to create a new sense for
the legitimacy of collective knowledge creation and dis-
tribution in democratic, datafied publics. For all their
shortcomings, these attempts are relevant and deserve
attention because they provide a vital starting point to
discuss how we can counter the threats of Big Data and
utilize the potential of these new technologies in ways
that do not damage democratic values and the agency of
those not in big government or big business. As Couldry
and Powell (2014: 4­5) point out, we should not only
highlight the risks of creating and sharing data, but also
8 Big Data & Society
the opportunities for forms of social organization that
take `into account agents' practices of giving an account
of themselves and their conditions of life'.
A guidance for future research provided by this ana-
lysis is to look at the way activists' practices and ideas
are institutionalized, i.e. how they are adapted by other
NGOs, news media, or public institutions. As activists
acknowledge themselves with their emphasis on the
importance of empowering intermediaries, their influ-
ence on the wider public--and therefore their potential
to support the agency of datafied publics--depends on
transforming existing institutions rather than on build-
ing new, alternative ones. To study these processes, we
can take further inspiration from Couldry's (2010: 1)
concept of `effective voice'--the insurance that `my
voice matters', which is a crucial aspect for both
agency and democratic legitimacy. We can argue that
activists describe important preconditions for processes
of effective voice in datafied societies. Yet we have to be
critical about whether the adaption of activists' prac-
tices and ideas really leads to effective voice, or only to
more opportunities to raise voice. What matters is how
`people's practices of voice are sustained and the out-
comes of those practices validated' (Couldry, 2010:
113). We have to ask whether and how the adaption
of activists' practices and ideas by news media, public
institutions, or others does or does not lead to struc-
tures that create and sustain the conditions necessary
for effective voice in increasingly datafied societies.
Such research can form the basis to further examine,
refine, and extend the practices and imaginaries of
activists to formulate in more detail the conditions
necessary to support agency in the `age of Big Data'.

3. `Free software' and `open source' generally refer to the
same practices. While the term free software emphasizes
social and cultural values (`free as in speech'), open
source emphasizes the practical advantages for develop-
ing software (Kelty, 2008). For convenience, I will use
`open source' to address both strands.

likely to act as mediators according to Latour's (2005: 39)
distinction of the terms.
