Introduction
The burden that a nonprescription drug label bears is to
inform consumers how to self-medicate safely and effectively
without the guidance of a physician or pharmacist (Soller,
1998; Sutherland, 2010). The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA, 1999) made a formal effort to lighten that burden by
standardizing the content, order, and format of all nonpre-
scription drug labels with the now-familiar Drug Facts Label
(DFL). The FDA continued this effort by requiring pharma-
ceutical drug manufacturers to conduct label comprehension
studies for all nonprescription drugs. In their Guidance to
Industry (FDA, 2010), the FDAsuggests that questions about
the primary communication objectives of a proposed label be
posed to potential consumers in one-to-one interviews using
an "open-label" procedure. Respondents are
... told before the study starts that they can refer to the label
during questioning. Questions can begin with the statement
"according to the label," however, subjects should not be overly
prompted to look at the label during questioning. (FDA, 2010: 9)
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate
an expanded label comprehension procedure that
addresses critical deficiencies in the current open-label
procedure.
A study designed by Raymond et al. (2002) with guid-
ance from the FDA offers a rare published example of the
open-label procedure. Raymond et al. assessed label com-
prehension of prototype DFL panels on a two-pill package
of a nonprescription emergency contraceptive (Plan B
Two-Step) and the six-panel patient insert inside the pack-
age. The text on the outside of the package conformed to
DFL standards; the text insert inside the package provided
Does the Drug Facts Label for
nonprescription drugs meet its
design objectives? A new procedure
for assessing label effectiveness

Abstract
We demonstrate an expanded procedure for assessing drug-label comprehension. Innovations include a pretest of
drug preconceptions, verbal ability and label attentiveness measures, a label-scanning task, a free-recall test, category-
clustering measures, and preconception-change scores. In total, 55 female and 39 male undergraduates read a facsimile
Drug Facts Label for aspirin, a Cohesive-Prose Label, or a Scrambled-Prose Label. The Drug Facts Label outperformed
the Scrambled-Prose Label, but not the Cohesive-Prose Label, in scanning effectiveness. The Drug Facts Label was no
better than the Cohesive-Prose Label or the Scrambled-Prose Label in promoting attentiveness, recall and organization
of drug facts, or misconception refutation. Discussion focuses on the need for refutational labels based on a sequence-
of-events text schema.

further information in a question­answer format (e.g. "Who
should not use Plan B?"). Raymond et al. made use of the
11 primary communication objectives of the drug to
develop 30 interviewer questions for assessing the commu-
nication effectiveness of the proposed labeling. In individ-
ual interviews, eligible respondents first briefly examined
the external DFL panels as if considering their purchase.
With the package out of sight, respondents then had to
explain the purpose of the drug. The interviewer next asked
respondents five more questions (e.g. "According to the
label, should Plan B be used as regular birth control?"),
allowing them to consult the package label as necessary.
Afterward, respondents were asked to open the package
and review the six-panel package insert as if they were
about to use the product. Finally, respondents answered 24
more questions (e.g. "Awoman had unprotected sex a week
ago and then used Plan B to prevent pregnancy. Was this a
correct use of Plan B?"), referring to the package labeling
or the package insert as necessary.
Raymond et al. adhered carefully to the FDA's (2010)
Guidance for the conduct of a label comprehension study.
In addition, they note that their "study design and question-
naire were heavily influenced by the Food and Drug
Administration's comments on early drafts of the protocol"
(2002, p. 342). The resulting study is a carefully conceived
and well-conducted open-label study. However, we believe
that there are significant deficiencies in the open-label pro-
tocol itself. Our aim in this study is to identify potential
improvements in the protocol that can increase the quality
of the data obtained from label comprehension studies.
We identify here seven deficiencies in the open-label
protocol that may limit its utility for assessing the compre-
hension of a set of drug facts. First, there is no pretest of
respondents' prior knowledge of contraceptive drugs.
Second, there is no measure of verbal ability. Third, there is
no measure of the care taken by respondents in attending to
the text of the DFL or the package insert. Fourth, there is no
assessment of the ease with which information could be
located on the label in response to interviewer questions.
Fifth, there is no measure of respondents' ability to retrieve
important label information from long-term memory. Sixth,
there is no formal evaluation of the subjective features of the
label (e.g. Perceived Organization or Authoritativeness) as a
medication guide. And seventh, there is no posttest of
respondents' knowledge and beliefs to determine whether
the label had confirmed or corrected preconceptions
respondents may have had about the drug. We consider
these deficiencies of the open-label procedure in the follow-
ing section. We then describe in our "Methods" section the
procedure we have developed to remedy these deficiencies.
Deficiencies in the label comprehension protocol
Assessing medication-specific beliefs.Text comprehension
depends on the reader's prior knowledge of the text topic as
well as the text itself (Reed, 2013: 266­292). In fact, a
number of studies have demonstrated that clear and well-
written science passages can fail to modify a reader's mis-
conceptions about the topic--even when the text refutes
those misconceptions (see Tippett, 2010). Therefore, it is
imperative that a label comprehension study begin with an
assessment of the preconceptions that consumers have
about the drug in question. This assessment should not be
limited to the primary communication objectives of the
label. With respect to an emergency contraceptive pill, for
example, some misconceptions about the appropriate use of
the product may arise from naïve beliefs about the nature of
the reproductive process. Morgan et al. (2002) use a "men-
tal models" approach to identify procedures for eliciting
valid and invalid preconceptions that consumers may bring
to their reading of health-protective communications. Rat-
ing-scale assessments of these beliefs offer a quantitative
measure that can serve as a pretest measure or a covariate
measure.
Assessing verbal ability. Because medical information seems
to pose a challenge to many consumers, label comprehen-
sion studies often include a measure of medical literacy.
One popular measure is the Rapid Estimate of Adult Liter-
acy in Medicine (REALM: Davis et al., 1993). The REALM
assesses health literacy by asking patients to pronounce 66
common medical terms. Rather than attempting to assess
general medical literacy, however, it may be more useful to
assess the specific knowledge a consumer has about the
drug under consideration. The information obtained from a
pretest such as we describe above serves that purpose.
Although a drug-specific pretest assesses the "health" com-
ponent of health literacy, it does not assess the "literacy"
component. Wide-range vocabulary measures offer a more
useful index of general verbal ability. The six-minute,
24-item Extended Range Vocabulary Test (ERVT: Ekstrom
et al., 1976) is suitable for Grades 7­16, covering a wide
range of ability levels.
Label attentiveness.With few exceptions (e.g. Bix et al.,
2009), label comprehension studies do not verify that
respondents have attended carefully to the text of the label.
Instead, respondents read the label as though deciding
whether to purchase the drug or how to use the drug. In the
absence of any external check on a respondent's attentiveness
to the label text, there are likely to be large differences among
respondents in what they read and what they do not read. The
open-label task itself compounds the problem: a respondent is
free to scan the label for an answer if recall fails. In order to
control statistically for differences in reading styles and moti-
vation, a measure of label attentiveness is necessary. Ryan
(2011) used the tactic of inserting obvious typographical
errors throughout a simulated analgesic label, asking partici-
pants to circle all errors they found.
Ryan and Costello-White 3
Label-scanning.Brass and Weintraub (2003) characterize
the open-label task as "one designed to demonstrate the
ability of consumers to extract relevant information from
the proposed label" (p. 407). Ease of scanning can be
assessed by timing how long it takes a respondent to locate
target information on a label, but that simple measure fails
to take into account the possibility that a respondent may
often be recalling the targeted information rather than find-
ing it on the label. A better measure involves giving a
respondent a randomized list of target words or phrases to
be located and marked on the label. If these targets are
drawn from throughout the label text, a count of the number
of target phrases found in a fixed amount of time provides
a more valid measure of scanning-ease.
Delayed free recall. Because some time may elapse between a
respondent's first reading of a drug label and the subsequent
use of the drug, it is important to assess the amount and accu-
racy of the label information that a consumer can retrieve from
long-term memory after an initial reading. A consumer may
not re-read the label when the time comes to use the drug, rely-
ing instead on his or her recollection of what the label had said.
Although specific circumstances might dictate another meas-
ure, a free-recall task following a distraction task ("recall
whatever you can from the label as it comes to mind") has four
virtues. First, a several-minute distraction task prior to the
recall effort ensures that a respondent is retrieving information
from long-term memory rather than from short-term memory.
Second, a free-recall task provides a measure of recall that
does not depend on question comprehension in the way that
multiple-choice or true­false questions do. Third, what con-
sumers recall and do not recall provides useful information
about their attention strategies. Finally, adjacent items in a
free-recall protocol will frequently belong to whatever subjec-
tive category an individual has used to organize label informa-
tion in long-term memory (Friendly, 1977). Such "category
clustering" provides invaluable information about the subjec-
tive organization of drug-label information.
Perceived label characteristics. Label comprehension studies
often rely on consumer perceptions in evaluating drug
product labels (e.g. preferences for different label formats).
Self-reports and subjective ratings are no substitute for
behavioral assessment (e.g. label-scanning speed or free
recall of drug facts). Nonetheless, a drug product may fail
in its mission if it does not have a positive impact on key
consumer perceptions. For example, consumers are likely
to read a label with greater care if they perceive it to be well
organized and easy to read (FDA, 1999: 13255). Standard-
ized rating scales provide an efficient way to collect infor-
mation about consumer perceptions that are likely to
increase their willingness to attend to label directives.
Re-assessing medication-specific beliefs.A posttest using rat-
ing-scale assessments of consumers' preconceptions about
a medication provides a useful index of the effectiveness of
a label in confirming and correcting drug preconceptions
(Ryan, 2011). One aspect of "knowledge updating" is the
degree to which readers use label information to strengthen
pretest beliefs that accord with that information. A second
aspect of knowledge updating is the degree to which read-
ers use label information to weaken pretest beliefs that con-
tradict that information. The two measures reflect different
ways in which readers modify their beliefs to accord with
the authoritative text of the label.
A demonstration study
In order to provide a detailed illustration of our label com-
prehension procedure, we examined the degree to which
the DFL (FDA, 1999) for aspirin achieves its design objec-
tives. We discuss below the four distinguishable objectives
identified at different points in the FDA's 1999 Final Rule.
Objective 1: Enhancing the appeal of nonprescription drug
labels. The DFL was designed to increase reading motiva-
tion and reading confidence by reducing the cognitive
demands of reading drug facts information. The simplified
wording of drug facts and the use of a highly legible visual
format were intended to reduce those cognitive demands
(FDA, 1999: 13255).
Objective 2:Increasing the ease of finding information on a non-
prescription drug label.The organization of the DFL was
designed to help consumers quickly locate and read impor-
tant drug information in order to permit fast and effective
product comparisons. An ordered set of standard headings
(Active Ingredients, Purposes, Uses, Warnings, Directions,
Other Information, Inactive Information, and Questions) is
used on the DFL to organize label information to facilitate
that scanning process (FDA, 1999: 13254).
Objective 3: Improving the comprehension and recall of drug
facts information.The layout, format, and headings of the
DFL were designed to improve consumers' ability to read,
understand, and recall label information. The DFL format
was thought to offer "a more structured, organized, and
compact presentation" that would reduce memory demands
in promoting a level of comprehension and recall sufficient
for the safe and effective use of a nonprescription drug
(FDA, 1999: 13254­13255).
Objective 4: Providing a model for the organization of drug
facts information. The nature and ordering of headings in
the DFL were designed to develop in consumers a deci-
sion-making process for selecting and using nonprescrip-
tion drugs. The standardized ordering of headings in the
DFL was meant to help consumers learn and use a deci-
sion-making schema for organizing drug facts informa-
tion (FDA, 1999: 13258).
4 Health Psychology Open 
Label readability and cohesion
The DFL was designed to achieve its objectives through the
organization, layout, and simplification of critical drug
information. An implicit assumption is that a highly reada-
ble prose version of those facts would not serve the purpose
as well. We could find no reports of the relative effective-
ness of prose versions of drug-label information. Therefore,
we seek in this study to use our modified label comprehen-
sion procedure to test the hypothesis the DFL is more effec-
tive than highly readable prose in achieving the FDA's four
design objectives.
We defined a highly readable prose version of drug facts
information as one that is both readable and cohesive.
Readability as it is conventionally measured assesses word
difficulty and sentence complexity by computing, respec-
tively, the average number of word strings in a sentence and
the average length of word strings in a text. Different reada-
bility formulae combine these two values in different ways to
obtain an estimate of reading level (Benjamin, 2012). The
FDA(2010) recommends that a DFLbe written to a readabil-
ity standard of "no higher than an 8th grade reading level" (p.
5). The Flesch­Kincaid Reading Level for our aspirin Drug
Facts Label (DFL) facsimile (see Appendix 1), for example,
is just at the 7th grade reading level with a value of 7.2. In
contrast, cohesiveness is a measure of the degree to which
the sentences in a text can be readily linked to each other.
Cohesiveness can be roughly estimated as the percentage of
sentences in a text that include a word-concept from a prior
sentence. Britton and Gülgöz (1991) have demonstrated that
reading cohesive text results in the recall of more text propo-
sitions per unit reading time than text not so interconnected.
Cohesive text is also likely to produce in the reader a mental
representation of the relationships among key text concepts
that more closely resemble the mental representation of the
text author than do less cohesive texts (Britton and Gülgöz,
1991: Exp. 2). Liu and Rawl (2012) have shown that high
levels of text cohesion in colorectal cancer screening infor-
mation are associated with decreased reading time and
increased comprehension performance. In addition, Smith et
al. (2011) found small but nonsignificant effects of text cohe-
siveness on the comprehension of research and clinical infor-
mation about diabetes mellitus effects.
In order to test the hypothesis that the DFL is superior to
highly readable prose, we first created a prose equivalent of
the DFL for aspirin by expressing the drug facts on that label
in simple sentence form. For example, "Active Ingredient
(in each tablet): Aspirin 325
mg aspirin NSAID" was re-
written as "The active ingredient in each regular-strength
tablet is aspirin. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID). There is 325
mg of aspirin in each tablet."
Bulleted items were expressed as full sentences. For exam-
ple, "Uses:  headache  muscle pain  toothache ..." was
re-written as "You can use aspirin to relieve headache. You
can use aspirin to relieve muscle pain. You can use aspirin to
relieve toothache pain ...." The headings used on the DFL
for aspirin were used as paragraph headings in our Cohesive-
Prose Label. We ensured that the text of this label was highly
cohesive by including a word from a prior sentence in each
new sentence (see Appendix 2). We also created a scram-
bled-prose version of the aspirin drug facts (seeAppendix 3)
as a comparison label that included all of the drug facts in
sentence form, but had little cohesion. Morrow et al. (1996)
made use of a similar logic in comparing the drug facts
recall of those who read an organized-prose label for a fic-
tional drug with the recall of those who read a scrambled-
sentences label for the same drug. Our SPL contained the
same sentences as the organized-prose label, but arranged
them in one of two random orders. No paragraph headings
were included in this scrambled-prose equivalent of the
drug facts for aspirin.
Experimental design and hypotheses.Each participant read
only one of the three facsimile labels we prepared; all label
assessment tasks were administered to every participant.
Label condition (DFL, CPL, or SPL) is our only between-
subjects treatment variable. The subject variable Verbal
Ability is used as a covariate in all of our analyses, and
adjusted means are reported whenever that covariate was
significantly correlated with a dependent measure. We use
throughout a mixed-model analysis of covariance with
Label Condition serving as a between-subjects variable,
Verbal Ability serving as a covariate, and one or more task
measures serving as within-subjects variables.
We used the SPL to create a content-control condition in
which participants would be able to read the complete set of
aspirin drug facts in the absence of any organizational
structure. We hypothesized that a reading of either the Drug
Facts Label or the Cohesive-Prose Label would allow par-
ticipants to perform significantly better on all of our design-
objective measures than would a reading of the
Scrambled-Prose Label. The question of primary interest,
however, is whether the layout and format of the DFL are a
more effective way to organize drug facts information than
is a cohesive-prose presentation of that information. If that
layout and format are uniquely suited to the task of label
comprehension then a reading of the Drug Facts Label
should allow participants to perform significantly better on
all of our design-objective measures than would a reading
of the Cohesive-Prose Label. We test that hypothesis by
examining measures of (a) the rated appeal of a drug label,
(b) the ease of finding information on a drug label, (c) the
comprehension and recall of drug facts, and (d) the organi-
zation of drug facts information in memory.
Methods
Participants
In total, 55 female and 39 male undergraduates between
the ages of 18 and 25 participated in hour-long group ses-
sions in order to satisfy a research requirement; all were
Ryan and Costello-White 5
native English speakers. Confirming our expectation that
aspirin is not commonly used by undergraduates (see
Ellen et al., 1998), only eight students reported having
used aspirin in the 30
days prior to their participation in
the study. In contrast, 66 reported having used ibuprofen;
51, acetaminophen; 22, naproxen. Participants reported
taking some care in reading label information for their
preferred analgesics (7
=
extreme care: M=3.38,
SEM=0.39), but they were confident that they could use
aspirin safely and effectively (7
=
extremely confident:
M=4.78, SEM
=
0.18). The mean ERVT verbal ability
score out of a possible 24 was 8.27 (SEM=0.36), with
scores ranging from 2 to 18. These scores did not vary
significantly as a function of the label condition to which
participants had been randomly assigned, F(2, 91)=2.22,
p>.10.
Label facsimiles
Drug Facts Label.Our DFL was a two-page, letter-sized
simulation of an aspirin label, with a cover page replicating
the Principle Display Panel for a brand name aspirin. We
used the exact wording from the then-current aspirin label.
The order of information and headings mirrored that DFL
order (i.e. Active Ingredient, Uses, Warnings, etc.). Bar-
lines, hairlines, indenting, bulleting, and white-space
matched those of the actual label. We increased font size to
make the DFL more legible, using 16-point, 14-point, and
12-point Arial font for headings, subheadings, and text.
The use of boldface and italics also matched the DFL.
Cohesive-Prose and Scrambled-Prose Labels. Our CPL was a
three-page, letter-sized prose version of the DFL made by
expanding each telegraphic DFL phrase into a complete
sentence. The sentence for any bulleted item included an
explicit cohesive link to its heading (e.g. the sentence "You
can use aspirin to reduce menstrual pain" was included in
its appropriate position in the Uses paragraph; each bul-
leted use followed as a separate sentence). Additional cohe-
sive links were added as necessary to ensure that each
sentence repeated a word from the previous sentence or
from the governing heading. These explicit lexical links aid
the reader by eliminating the need to link adjacent sen-
tences by recalling or re-reading earlier sentences or by
making language- or knowledge-based inferences (cf. Brit-
ton and Gülgöz, 1991; Lesgold et al., 1979). The FDA-
mandated headings and subheadings appeared as indented
paragraph headings in bold, italicized font. All headings
and text were in 12-point Arial font. We created our SPL by
eliminating all paragraph headings from our CPL and then
preparing two random orderings of those CPL sentences to
counterbalance any order effects. We created an artificial
paragraph structure with sequences of indented sentence
strings that paralleled the length and ordering of paragraphs
in the CPL.
Assessing text cohesion. The DFL, CPL, and SPL had com-
parable Flesch­Kincaid reading grade levels of 7.4, 7.5,
and 7.8, respectively.As would be expected, the word count
for the CPL and SPL was higher at 1017 and 993, respec-
tively, than the count for the DFL at 613. We computed
cohesion values for the CPL and the SPL using the follow-
ing logic. The CPL is comprised of 94 sentences (counting
paragraph headings as sentences). The total number of CPL
sentence pairs is then 93 minus the 17 pairs composed of
the last sentence on one paragraph and the first sentence of
the next--for a final count of 76 CPL pairs that could be
lexically linked. We then divided 67--the number of adja-
cent CPL sentence pairs that were directly linked with a
shared word or phrase--by 76 to obtain a lexical cohesion
value of 88percent. Similarly, the total number of SPL sen-
tence pairs that could be lexically linked is then 78 minus
the 14 paragraph-transition pairs--for a final count of 64.
We found only 12 sentence pairs in the SPL that were
directly linked with a shared word, so the value of our lexi-
cal cohesion index was 19percent.
Calculating a cohesion index for the DFL is problematic
because it is not true prose. We made two assumptions in
order to make an estimate. Because each drug fact in the
DFL had given rise to a separate sentence in the CPL and
each DFL heading had given rise to a separate paragraph,
we again estimated the possible number of lexical links as
76. We obtained an indirect and very liberal estimate of the
number of direct lexical links in the DFL by counting the
number of bulleted items and subtracting that value from
76. By this logic, each bullet reflects the absence of a cohe-
sive link and calls for a concept in the bulleted heading to
be reinstated by a reader (cf. Kieras, 1978). Given a bullet
count of 40, we estimated the number of direct cohesive
links in the DFL as 36. Dividing that estimate by the total
number of idea pairs, we obtained a lexical cohesion index
of 47
percent for the DFL. By our estimate, therefore, the
cohesiveness value of the DFL is about half that of the
CPL.
Label attentiveness.We needed a measure of label attentive-
ness to control statistically for individual differences in read-
ing style and motivation in our analyses. Following Ryan
(2011), we inoculated our DFL, CPL, and SPL texts with
obvious spelling errors (e.g. pan rather than pain or doctar
rather than doctor). Although the spelling errors are shown
only for our Drug Facts Label facsimile in Appendix 1, the
same spelling errors were included in the Cohesive-Prose
Label and the Scrambled-Prose Label actually used by par-
ticipants in those two label conditions. The spelling errors in
all three facsimile labels were distributed at roughly equal
intervals throughout the label texts. No error occurred in any
word that was central to the meaning of an aspirin drug fact.
The DFL, the CPL, and the SPL texts contained the same 26
errors. We told participants that there were at least 20 spelling
errors to be found and circled as they read their label. In
6 Health Psychology Open 
addition, we emphasized that it was important that they pay
careful attention to all of the information in the label so that
they could perform as well as possible on the recall and com-
prehension tests that would follow their reading of the label.
We verified that our attentiveness task was a nonreactive one
by examining the correlation between attentiveness scores
and the subsequent recall of drug facts from the label. Any
shallow processing induced by the error-detection task should
impair recall, resulting in a negative correlation between the
two measures; in contrast, any deep processing induced by
the error-detection task would facilitate recall, resulting in a
positive correlation (cf. Craik and Lockhart, 1972). In fact,
the overall correlation between error detection and subse-
quent free recall is close to 0, Pearson's r(80)=+.09, p>.20,
demonstrating that the task neither impaired nor facilitated
drug facts recall.
Outcome measures
Objective 1: Enhancing the appeal of nonprescription drug
labels.After completing the label-scanning task, partici-
pants rated five subjective characteristics of our labels--the
labels were not available for inspection as they made these
ratings. Four sets of items were rated with a 7-point scale
(1=very much disagree; 7=very much agree). Three items
contributed to a Perceived Readability subscale ("The Drug
Facts were very clearly written and extremely easy to
understand."), Cronbach's 
=
.73. Four items contributed
to a Perceived Cognitive Load subscale ("It was hard to put
all of the information together"), 
=
.76. Four items con-
tributed to a Perceived Organization subscale ("The label
information was very well organized"), =.81. Three items
contributed to a Perceived Authoritativeness subscale
("The label information is authoritative with directions that
should be carefully followed"), =.83. Finally, four items
contributed to a Perceived Recallability subscale. Here, we
asked for perceived efficacy ratings (1
=
not at all confi-
dent; 7=extremely confident) for the recall of drug facts ("I
can list from memory all of the reasons one should not use
this drug without first consulting a doctor"), =.80.
Objective 2:Increasing the ease of finding information on a nonpre-
scription drug label.We constructed 23 sentence-completion
items (e.g. "Vomiting blood is a sign of _________ bleeding")
to probe for information from throughout the text of each
label. None of these items involved drug facts from which we
had drawn the aspirin claims described below. Two different
orderings of these items were prepared with the constraint that
each missing target word was on a different page than the pre-
vious target word. In order to prevent participants from simply
recalling the information when they could, participants had to
locate and circle each target word on a clean copy of their aspi-
rin label. They also recorded that word or phrase on the
response form. We defined "scanning efficiency" as the num-
ber of target words correctly circled in 5minutes.
Objective 3a: Improving the comprehension of drug facts.We
used 30 aspirin drug facts from throughout the DFL to con-
struct aspirin claims that were plausibly true or false. Fifteen
of these claims were paraphrases of facts directly stated on
the label (e.g. "You should drink a full glass of water each
time you take aspirin"). We refer to this set of aspirin claims
as Label-Congruent (LC) claims because each such claim is
explicitly confirmed in each version of the aspirin drug facts
(e.g. "drink a full glass of water with each dose"). The
remaining 15 aspirin claims were incorrect paraphrases of
drug facts directly stated on the label (e.g. "Aspirin should be
kept in the refrigerator in order to maintain its potency"). We
refer to this second set of aspirin claims as Label-Discrepant
(LD) claims because each such claim is directly contradicted
in each version of the aspirin drug facts (e.g. "store at room
temperature"). We created two different orderings of the 30
claims, with each block of six claims including three LC and
three LD claims. In order to encourage participants to rely on
their intuitions in rating the perceived validity of each claim,
we ask them to use a 6-point Likert scale with anchor-point
labels that emphasized intuitive validity (1
=
definitely feels
false; 6=definitely feels true).
Objective 3b: Improving the recall of drug facts.As their last
task in the study, participants had 5minutes to write down as
many facts as they could recall from the aspirin information
they had read. We encouraged them to write down any label-
related information as it occurred to them--without trying to
recall the drug facts in order and without worrying about
whether they were completely correct or not. We asked them
to write down enough information about each recalled drug
fact to allow us to score the recalled item as true or false.
When we coded recall, we used gist scoring to give full credit
to any fact correctly recalled from the text. We gave partial
credit to any fact that referenced specific information from
the label even if it was incorrect, distorted, or vague. This
scoring scheme allowed us to use a strict or lenient standard
for recall in our analyses. Using a strict standard, we counted
only drug fact reports that had received full credit; using a
lenient standard, we added to our full-credit count any facts
that had received partial credit. In order to determine whether
our recall measure was biased by the post-label ratings of
aspirin claims or by the label-scanning task, we also coded
recall reports for any of a new set of 30 aspirin drug facts that
were not included among the aspirin claims or among the
targets of the scanning probes.
Objective 4: Providing a model for the organization of drug facts
information. One virtue of a free-recall measure of memory
is that the order in which information is recalled can reveal
how that information is organized in memory (Friendly,
1977). If the DFL imposes a "decision-making" category
structure upon consumers' organization of drug facts infor-
mation, then drug facts presented under the same DFL head-
ing would likely be adjacent to each other in our participants'
Ryan and Costello-White 7
free-recall protocols. We tested this hypothesis by classify-
ing every label-specific item reported in each recall protocol
using a seven-category schema defined by the headings in
the DFL. We included only the major categories of aspirin
drug facts in the DFL schema: (a) Uses, (b) Reye's Syn-
drome, (c) Allergy Alert, (d) Stomach Bleeding, (e) Ask
Doctor Before Use, (f) Stop Use If, and (g) Directions. We
coded all information recalled by our participants, including
any incorrect, distorted, or vague information traceable to
specific label phrases. We also classified all label-specific
items reported on our recall form using a variation of the
three-category "naïve medication schema" Morrow et al.
(1996) identified for short prescription drug labels. We
modified those schema categories to make them more suit-
able for classifying the kinds of drug facts found on nonpre-
scription drug labels: (a) Purpose, (b) Warnings, and (c)
Directions. This dual-coding system allowed us to examine
whether the organization of aspirin drug facts in memory is
governed by the authorized medication schema embodied in
the DFL or by a pre-existing naïve medication schema. We
used the adjusted ratio of clustering (ARC: Roenker et al.,
1971) to measure the degree to which the formal DFL
schema was more successful than Morrow's naïve medica-
tion schema in accounting for the order in which drug facts
were recalled.
Procedure
After providing informed consent, participants received a
folder from which they removed and replaced forms as
directed by the experimenter. Because reading the DFL
required about 4
minutes and reading the CPL and SPL
about 7
minutes, separate group sessions were conducted
for each label condition. Although the additional reading
time accorded the two prose labels might have advantaged
participants in those conditions, we show in our analyses
that reading time per se is not critical: the CPL and SPL
groups differ in important ways even though participants
spent the same amount of time reading each label.
We asked our participants to rate the 30 aspirin claims
before they actually read their facsimile label. We told them
to read each claim as carefully as necessary to be certain of
its meaning and then to take no more than 2 or 3seconds to
circle a number indicating how true it seemed. We explained
that we wanted them to base their ratings on their "gut feel-
ings" rather than relying on anything they might have heard
or read about aspirin. We also informed them that their rat-
ings would be more reliable if they made "snap judgments"
after they had taken the time to understand each claim. Our
assumption in providing these instructions was that any
preconceptions they had would be rooted in their enduring
intuitions rather than in their conscious and deliberate anal-
ysis of the claims. We paced them through the claims at a
rate of 10
seconds per claim to allow a careful reading of
each claim prior to rating its intuitive validity.
We then asked our participants to read their aspirin label as
carefully as possible, circling any inserted spelling errors as
they found them. After participants had read their labels, they
had 6
minutes to complete the 24-item ERVT. Immediately
afterward, we asked them to complete the aspirin claims form
as a posttest. We again emphasized the importance of rating
their "gut feeling" about the truth of a claim after reading it
carefully. We also cautioned participants not to try to recall
their pretest ratings or specific label information as they made
their judgments. We told them that making spontaneous, non-
reflective judgments would improve the likelihood that their
truth ratings would accurately reflect their enduring intuitions
in future days or weeks. As on the pretest, we gave them
10seconds to read and rate each claim.
Next, we guided participants through the 5-minute scan-
ning task. Afterward, they evaluated the label they had read
by completing the 18-item label-evaluation form. The label
was not available to them as they made these ratings.
Finally, 3
minutes after completing the scanning task, our
participants had 5minutes to recall as many aspirin facts as
they could, recording each fact on a different line on the
response form. We strongly encouraged them to write down
any idea as it occurred, even if they were not certain that it
had appeared on the label. After completing this task, each
participant received a debriefing form and had the opportu-
nity to ask questions about the study.
Results
Preliminary analyses showed that error-detection scores
were not a significant covariate in any analysis. Therefore,
we treat our attentiveness scores as an additional outcome
measure. We omitted from all analyses data from 12 partici-
pants who did not carry out the label-scanning task as
instructed.
Aspirin-specific preconceptions. Verbal ability was not a sig-
nificant covariate in the analyses of truth ratings for LC
and LD aspirin claims, F(1, 78)=1.03. Prior to reading any
label information, participants rated LC claims as signifi-
cantly more true (M=4.42, SEM
=
0.05) than LD claims
(M=3.60, SEM=0.05), F(1, 78)=20.13, MSE=0.19,
p<.001, 2
=
.21. The mean rating of 4.42 for the 15 LC
claims is well above 3.50 (the mathematical midpoint of
our 6-point rating scale), t(81)=17.34, p<.001, suggesting
that our participants were generally certain that our LC
claims were valid. The mean rating of 3.60 for the 15 LD
claims is just above that scale midpoint, t(81)=2.02,
p
<
.05, suggesting that our participants were generally
uncertain about whether our LD claims were valid or
invalid.
Label attentiveness. Verbal ability did not influence how
many of the 26 inserted spelling errors our participants
detected and circled, F(1, 78)=2.47, p>.10, but the effect of
8 Health Psychology Open 
label version was significant, F(2, 78)=4.56, MSE=18.45,
p<.05, 2
=
.09. The number of inserted errors circled by
participants as they read the DFL was 15.04 (SEM=0.74);
by participants as they read the CPL, 18.26 (SEM=0.80); by
participants as they read the SPL, 17.17 (SEM=0.78). Bon-
ferroni comparisons showed that the label version effect
was due to a lower error-detection rate in the DFL condition
as compared to the CPL condition, p<.05. This result may
reflect the difficulty of detecting spelling errors in the DFL's
telegraphic text.
Objective 1: Enhancing the appeal of
nonprescription drug labels
We used a multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the
mean ratings on the five label-evaluation scales. Verbal abil-
ity did not affect any of the five scale ratings, Wilk's =0.95,
F(5, 73)
<
1.00. The overall effect of label version on sub-
scale scores was significant, Wilk's 
=
0.47, F(10,
148)=5.78, p<.001, 2
=
.31. Follow-up univariate tests
showed that label version significantly affected ratings of
Perceived Organization, F(2, 77)=29.57, MSE=1.18,
p<.001, 2=.43, Perceived Cognitive Load, F(2, 77)=5.22,
MSE=1.25, p<.007, 2
=
.12, and Perceived Authoritative-
ness, F(2, 77)=5.51, MSE=1.30, p<.006, 2=.13. However,
label version did not affect ratings of Perceived Readability,
F(2, 77)=2.07, MSE=1.42, p>.10, or Perceived Recallabil-
ity, F(2, 77)=1.32, MSE=1.25, p>.20.
As can be seen in Figure 1, the DFL was rated signifi-
cantly more organized than the SPL, DM
=+2.04, SEDiff
=0.30,
p
<
.001, as was the CPL, DM
=+1.90, SEDiff
=0.30, p<.001.
Both the DFL and the CPL also had significantly lower cog-
nitive-load ratings than the SPL, DM
=­0.85, SEDiff
=0.31,
p<.01, and DM
=­0.86, SEDiff
=0.31, p<.01, respectively. In
addition, the DFL and the CPL were both judged as signifi-
cantly more authoritative than the SPL, DM
=+ 0.81,
SEDiff
=0.31, p<.01, and DM
=+0.96, SEDiff
=0.31, p<.01,
respectively. Bonferroni-adjusted comparisons at .05 level
showed that the DFL and the CPL did not differ in Perceived
Organization, Cognitive Load, or Authoritativeness ratings.
Objective 2: Increasing the ease of finding
information on a nonprescription drug label
Scanning ease was measured as the number of target drug-
facts phrases found and circled on a facsimile label within a
fixed amount of time. These scores were adjusted for verbal
ability effects because that covariate had a significant effect
on scanning performance, F(1, 78)=11.88, MSE=12.64,
p<.001, 2=.13. Label version significantly affected scan-
ning scores, F(2, 78)=15.31, MSE=12.64, p<.001, 2=.28.
Of the 23 label targets, those reading the DFL found and
circled 10.83 (SEM
=
0.67) within the allotted 5-minute
interval; those reading the CPL found and circled 9.97
(SEM=0.70); those reading the SPL found and circled 5.85
(SEM=0.68). Scanning success was significantly greater for
those reading the DFL than for those reading the SPL,
DM
=4.98, SEDiff
=0.96, p<
.001. Those reading the CPL
were also significantly more successful than those reading
the SPL, DM
=4.12, SEDiff
=0.98, p<.001. However, a
Bonferroni comparison showed that those reading the DFL
did not locate significantly more targets than those reading
the CPL, p>.10.
Objective 3a: Improve the comprehension of
drug facts information
Because pretest ratings of LC and LD claims did not differ
significantly across label conditions, we subtracted the ini-
tial rating of each claim from its final rating to obtain an
index of the degree to which reading the label appropriately
updated claim ratings. A positive value of this knowledge-
updating index for LC claims reflects confirmatory updat-
ing; a negative value of the index for LD claims reflects
corrective updating.
Participant-by-participant knowledge updating. We entered
claim type (LC and LD) as a repeated-measures variable
and label version (DFL, CPL, or SPL) as a between-
subjects variable. We did not adjust this index for verbal
ability because it was not a significant covariate in this
analysis, F(1, 76)>1.00. The mean updating scores in
each label condition are shown in Figure 2. Label ver-
sion had no main effect on updating scores, F(2,
79)=1.44, MSE
=
0.13, nor did it interact with claim
type, F(1, 78)<1.00. However, the value of the knowl-
edge-updating index was significantly greater for LC
claims (M=+0.62, SEM
=
0.06) than for LD claims
(M=+0.04, SEM=0.06), F(1, 79)=58.96, MSE=0.23,
p<.001, 2=.43. Because both updating indices should
have changed as a result of reading the aspirin drug
Figure 1. Ratings of label perceptions for Drug Facts Label (DFL),
Cohesive-Prose Label (CPL), and Scrambled-Prose Label (SPL).
Ryan and Costello-White 9
facts, we also tested whether the two indices were sig-
nificantly different from the no-change value of 0.
While the knowledge-updating index for ratings of LC
claims was significantly different from 0, t(80)=11.24,
p
<
.001, the updating index for ratings of LD claims
was not, t(80)<1.00.
Claim-by-claim knowledge updating. We also conducted a claim-
by-claim analysis. The mean updating indices for each of the
15 LC claims and the 15 LD claims were treated as two levels
of a between-claims factor, with label version treated as three
levels of a within-claims factor. There was no main effect of
label version, F(2, 56)=2.56, p
<
.10, and no label ver-
sion×claim type interaction, F(2, 56)=1.32, MSE=0.10,
p
>
.20. The effect of claim type on the knowledge-updating
index was highly significant, F(1, 28)=15.85, MSE=0.17,
p<.001, 2
=
.36. As was the case in the individual-subject
analysis, a significant increase in the updating index was found
for LC claims (M=+0.61, SEM
=
0.11), but no significant
decrease was found for LD claims (M=+0.01, SEM=0.11).
Here too, the updating index for ratings of LC claims was sig-
nificantly different from 0, t(80)=5.55, p<.001, and the index
for ratings of LD claims was not, t(80)<1.00. As can be seen
in Figure 2, the knowledge-updating effect sizes are nearly
identical for both the individual-subject and the individual-
claim analyses. In both analyses, ratings for LD claims were
unchanged by any of the three labels.
Objective 3b: Improving the recall of drug facts
In our scoring of participants' free-recall responses, we
gave full credit to any response that correctly paraphrased
label information (e.g. "you should see a doctor if you have
trouble hearing"). We gave partial credit to any response
that included specific information from the label--even if it
was incorrect (e.g. "don't take more than 3 drinks a day"),
distorted (e.g. "you should not take aspirin if you have
Reye's syndrome"), or vague (e.g. "stomach ulcers or
bleeding problems"). This scoring scheme allowed us to
use a strict or lenient standard for recall in our analyses.
Using a strict standard, we counted only drug facts reports
that had received full credit. Using a lenient standard, we
added to our full-credit count any fact that had received
partial credit. The DFL, CPL, and SPL did not differ sig-
nificantly in their ERVT-adjusted recall scores using either
a strict criterion, F(2, 78)<1.00, or a lenient criterion, F(2,
78)<1.00. We report lenient recall scores as Total Recall in
Figure 3 because we wanted a sensitive measure of the
impact of the label on memory. Our reasoning was that any
item of information that bore the imprint of specific word-
ing in the label text demonstrated the impact of the label on
memory--even if it was not strictly correct. This lenient
standard also ensured that we had a large enough pool of
responses to use in our category-clustering analyses.
A further analysis showed that label version did not dif-
ferentially affect the amount of Purpose, Directions, or
Warnings drug-facts recall. These three categories reflect
those in the naïve medication schema identified by Morrow
et al. (1996). Here too, verbal ability was a significant
covariate, F(1, 78)=6.19, MSE=4.32, p=.015, 2=.07.
Neither label version, F(2, 78)
<
1.00, nor its interaction
with drug-fact category, F(4, 156)
=
1.02, was significant.
The significant main effect of drug-fact category, F(2,
156)=13.19, MSE=4.25, p<.001, 2=.15, is due to differ-
ences among the categories in the frequency with which
they appear among the drug facts on the aspirin label. The
relative differences in the ERVT-adjusted means in each
category approximate the relative frequencies of each kind
of fact in the label itself. Figure 3 displays the ERVT-
adjusted recall scores for each category of label content.
We also conducted an analysis of the free-recall data in
which we counted only correctly recalled aspirin facts that

and Label-Discrepant (LD) beliefs by participants (P) and by
individual claims (C).

had not been among those we included in our set of aspirin
claims nor in our set of label-scanning targets. This scoring
procedure allowed us to assess whether either task had biased
our measure of recall performance. However, we still found
that the labels did not differ in their recall effectiveness, F(2,
78)
<
1.00. Recall of this restricted set of 30 drug facts was
marginally greater for the DFL (M=4.16, SEM=0.39) than
for the CPL (M=3.64, SEM
=
0.47) or the SPL (M=3.43,
SEM=0.45).
Objective 4: Providing a model for the
organization of drug facts information
Using the order in which each participant had recorded
aspirin drug facts on the response sheet, we counted the
number of pairs of adjacent items that belonged to the
same schema category. We did separate counts for the DFL
seven-category schema and Morrow's three-category
schema. Roenker et al.'s (1971) ARC index computes the
ratio of same-heading pairs observed to the total number of
possible pairs; it also corrects for the number of same-
heading pairs that would occur by chance. In addition, it
includes a k value that corrects for individual differences
in the number of categories from which two of more items
are reported. For coding using Morrow et al.'s naïve medi-
cation schema, our participants' k values were 2 or 3; for
coding using the authorized DFL schema, their k values
were 2, 3, or 4. Computed ARC values can range from
-1.00 to +1.00, but negative scores are not interpretable
(Roenker et al., 1971). We followed the common practice
of replacing all negative ARC values with a zero to indi-
cate that a given recall protocol involved only a chance
level of category clustering. An ARC score of .30 repre-
sents a moderate degree of clustering, but the best use of
the index is to determine which of two or more classifica-
tion schemes is associated with the highest ARC score. For
the DFL, CPL, and SPL aspirin texts, 26, 19, and 23 par-
ticipants, respectively, recalled enough aspirin information
to permit the computation of an ARC score for both sche-
mas and the use of a repeated-measures analysis.
We analyzed the two ARC scores for each participant as
a within-subjects medication-schema factor and label ver-
sion as a between-subjects factor, including verbal ability
as a covariate. Verbal ability significantly influenced ARC
scores, F(1, 64)=3.90, MSE=0.06, p=.053, 2=.06, but
label version did not, F(2, 64)
<
1.00. Medication schema
had a significant impact on ARC scores, F(1, 64)=8.10,
MSE=0.03, p=.006, 2
=
.11, but the medication
schema×label version interaction did not, F(2, 64)<1.00.
Overall, the degree of category clustering was almost twice
as high for Morrow et al.'s naïve medication schema
(M=0.30, SEM=0.03) as for the DFL's authorized medica-
tion schema (M=0.17, SEM=0.02). Bonferroni compari-
sons showed the ARC values for Morrow et al.'s naïve
schema to be significantly greater than those for the
authorized schema for each version of the aspirin drug
facts, ps<.05 (see Figure 4 for mean ARC values for each
label version and each category scheme). However, it is
also the case the ARC values for the authorized medication
schema are significantly greater than zero for the DFL, the
CPL, and the SPL label texts, t(24)=5.33, p<.001,
t(17)=3.50, p<.005, and t(21)=5.00, p<.001, respectively.
The pattern of results suggests that both medication sche-
mas play a significant role in organizing aspirin informa-
tion in memory, but the naïve medication schema is the
more influential.
Discussion
Summary of findings
The Drug Facts Label performs and fails to perform
much as its Cohesive-Prose counterpart on every meas-
ure we used. Participants rated aspirin drug facts as sig-
nificantly more organized, less cognitively demanding,
and more authoritative when presented in a Drug Facts
Label or in a Cohesive-Prose Label than in a Scrambled-
Prose Label. Perceptions of readability and recallability
did not differ across the three label conditions. Label-
scanning performance was significantly and comparably
better for both the DFL and the CPL as compared to the
SPL. Unexpectedly, the free recall of drug facts was no
greater for the DFL than for our CPL or our SPL. Morrow
et al.'s (1996) categories of Purpose, Warnings, and
Directions accounted for the organization of drug facts
in recall to a significantly greater extent than did the
seven major headings of the DFL in all three label condi-
tions, but this effect did not vary as a function of label
condition. Most importantly, all three labels were equally
effective in promoting the confirmatory updating of LC
claims. In contrast, all three labels were equally ineffec-
tive in promoting the corrective updating of LD claims.

Interpretation
We interpret our findings by evaluating the degree to which
the DFL meets its design objectives (FDA, 1999).
Objective 1: Enhancing the appeal of nonprescription drug
labels. Participants reading the DFL for aspirin did perceive
the reading process to be less demanding cognitively than
reading the SPL. They also perceived the text to be more
organized and the information to be more authoritative than
did those reading the SPL. However, the CPL was equally
superior to the SPL on those three dimensions. In contrast,
participants did not judge the aspirin information on the DFL
or the CPL to be significantly more understandable or more
memorable than that on the SPL. We believe that this latter
finding reflects the challenge participants face in monitoring
comprehension or predicting recall. Perceptions of compre-
hension were not correlated with either confirmatory updat-
ing, Pearson's r(80)
=
­.15, or corrective updating,
r(80)=+.00, respectively, nor were perceptions of recallabil-
ity correlated with lenient gist recall, r(80)=+.18. In sum-
mary,theDFLmeetstheobjectiveofmotivatinglabel-reading
efforts by reducing Perceived Cognitive Load, increasing
Perceived Organization, and increasing Perceived Authorita-
tiveness. However, it is no more effective in doing so than
the CPL (see Figure 1).
Objective 2:Increasing the ease of finding information on a non-
prescription drug label.Those scanning the DFL for target
words or phrases found significantly more in a 5-minute
period than did those scanning the SPL. However, those
scanning the CPL found as many targets as those scanning
the DFL. Kools et al. (2008) varied the number of headings
included in three different versions of a five-page health
education text and asked their undergraduate participants to
search for 10 information targets in the text. They found
that all versions of the text that included headings were
searched more quickly than a control text version that had
no headings. Our CPL used as paragraph headings the same
headings as the DFL, and our SPL had no headings.
Although the DFL does achieve the objective of helping
readers quickly locate information, the scanning advantage
of the DFL over the SPL may arise simply from the use of
headings rather than from any other feature of the label.
Objective 3: Improving the comprehension and recall of drug
facts information.Our comprehension measure focuses on
the degree to which reading a set of drug facts modifies
one's preconceptions about aspirin--increasing truth val-
ues for facts confirmed by a label and decreasing values for
facts refuted by a label. Neither the DFL nor the CPL pro-
duced significantly greater confirmational change or refu-
tational change than did the SPL (see Figure 2). We used
recall as a surrogate measure of a reader's ability to apply
label information because drug facts that are not recalled
cannot influence the safe and effective use of a nonpre-
scription drug. Neither the DFL nor the CPL produced sig-
nificantly more recall on any of our four indices than did
the SPL (see Figure 3). These findings indicate that the
DFL may not fully achieve its comprehension and applica-
tion objectives.
Objective 4: Providing a model for the organization of drug facts
information.Our analysis of category clustering indicates
that neither the DFL nor the CPL has any greater effect on
the mental organization of drug facts than does the SPL.
Although DFL categories significantly influenced recall
clustering for all three labels, a simpler naïve schema using
only the categories of Purpose, Warnings, and Directions
(Morrow et al., 1996) was significantly more effective in
accounting for the order in which drug facts were recalled
(see Figure 4). These findings strongly suggest that the
DFL does not achieve its objective of influencing the way
in which consumers organize drug facts information.
Limitations
Our data indicate that the DFL was no more effective than
its cohesive-prose equivalent in achieving any of its design
objectives. Our findings are limited in the following ways.
Cohesiveness manipulation. Although we were able to estab-
lish a high degree of lexical cohesiveness in our cohesive-
prose version of the drug facts, free recall was no greater
than in the scrambled-prose version. We believe the failure
of our cohesiveness manipulation is due to the specialized
nature of the drug-label discourse itself. Text comprehen-
sion research has shown that causal connections are partic-
ularly effective in improving the comprehension and recall
of narrative texts (cf. Trabasso and Van den Broek, 1985).
Because our CPL, like the SPL and the DFL, is simply a
categorized listing of aspirin drug facts, the cohesive links
we created established lexical links between adjacent sen-
tence pairs rather than the causal links that Britton and Gül-
göz created for their narrative text. The recall of drug facts
information in both the DFL and our CPL might be
improved by inserting causal links that explicitly organize
the drug facts as steps in a decision-making process.
Choice of nonprescription drug.Our findings are limited to
the DFL for aspirin. Because aspirin is not commonly used
by undergraduates (Ellen et al., 1998), they are unlikely to
have read the label and will be biased largely by their pre-
conceptions about the drug rather than by their actual expe-
rience in using the drug. Because the aspirin drug facts are
FDA-approved and appear on all product labels for aspirin,
our facsimile label is authoritative in a way that a fictional
drug label (cf. Morrow et al., 1996) would not be. The fact
that our young adult college students are not likely to be
familiar with aspirin as an analgesic nor with the DFL for
12 Health Psychology Open 
aspirin does not threaten the internal validity of our study,
but it does mean that the effects we report here may be qual-
itatively different for other more commonly used nonpre-
scription analgesics or for other classes of nonprescription
drugs (e.g. antacids, antihistamines, and anti-diarrheals).
Nature of the label-processing task. Our label-reading task is
not designed to simulate the label inspection process that
occurs when a consumer is comparing one product with
another in the same class at the point-of-purchase or when a
consumer subsequently self-medicates with that drug. In
both situations, the reading process is likely to be less sys-
tematic and thoughtful than the task we posed our partici-
pants. Prior to reading their assigned label, our participants
were asked to rate the perceived truth of 30 different claims
about the information to be found on an aspirin drug label.
They were then told that they would have a chance to read
the actual drug facts for aspirin before rating these claims a
second time and recalling what they could from the label.
The label-reading instructions they were given encouraged
participants to read all of the label information very care-
fully.As a check on the care they took in inspecting the label
information, we asked them to circle any of the typographi-
cal errors we had inserted into the drug facts text. In sum-
mary, we have every reason to believe that our participants
read the aspirin drug facts much more closely than the aver-
age consumer would in making his or her drug purchase or
in referring to the label for guidance in using the drug for
symptomatic relief. Our intention was to ensure that partici-
pants performed as well as possible on our dependent meas-
ures. For that reason, we believe that under everyday reading
conditions, consumers would not perform nearly as well as
our participants on the tasks we posed them. Future studies
are needed to determine the generality of our findings across
a range of more ecologically valid conditions.
Particpant sample.We must also limit our conclusions
about label comprehension to young adult college students.
Different consumer populations might vary in their precon-
ceptions about aspirin, their familiarity with the DFL, and
their general knowledge of nonprescription drugs. In addi-
tion, our procedure focuses on a knowledge-updating
measure of comprehension. This measure is a critical one
for assessing label effectiveness, but there are many other
ways to define and measure comprehension (White, 2011).
Clearly, conceptual replications of our findings using other
dependent measures should be conducted.
Carry-over effects. Given the number of tasks in our procedure,
it is possible that carry-over effects bias some of our measures.
The drug-facts recall task, for example, was preceded not only
by the label-reading task but also by the intervening vocabulary
test, the post-label aspirin belief ratings, the label-scanning
task, and label-evaluation ratings. The vocabulary test does not
share any content with the DFL, and the label-evaluation
ratings were based on participants' recollection of the label,
rather than on a re-inspection of the label. However, the aspirin
belief statements may have reminded participants of specific
drug facts on the label, and the label-scanning task necessarily
involved a selective inspection of the label. We corrected for
potential contamination effects by scoring recall protocols only
for drug facts that were not included in the aspirin beliefs scale
and not included among the label-scanning targets. Scores on
this ancillary measure showed the same effect as the other
measures of recall. In addition, any contamination effects on
drug facts recall would have affected each label condition in the
same way. It is also possible that pre-label belief ratings influ-
enced the reading of the DFLs and the post-label belief ratings.
Once again, any contamination effects would have been con-
stant across the three label conditions.
Implications
Although further refinements of our procedure may be neces-
sary, two important insights about label comprehension
emerge in this study. First, the impact of consumers'domain-
specific drug preconceptions and their domain-general medi-
cation schemas on the label comprehension process deserves
much more examination. Second, nonprescription drug labels
may require major modifications in order to ensure that they
correct consumers' drug preconceptions and to facilitate the
development of valid medication schemas.
Prior-knowledge effects. In this study, we define label compre-
hension as the degree to which consumers can use a nonpre-
scription drug label to modify their knowledge of a drug so
that they can use that drug safely and effectively. This defini-
tion assumes that consumers have their own preconcep-
tions--however vague and ill informed--about how they
can make best use of a given drug to treat the symptoms that
concern them. Our definition also assumes that label com-
prehension is a mental representation that arises from the
interaction of readers' preconceptions about a drug with the
text of the drug label (cf. Jungermann et al., 1988; Morris
and Aikin, 2001). We use changes in truth ratings for a set of
aspirin drug-facts claims to measure the degree to which a
label is effective in modifying drug-specific preconceptions
about aspirin. Existing measures of health literacy (Davis
et al., 1993; Parker et al., 1995) do not serve this purpose.
Because such measures seek to assess a consumer's general
health and medical literacy, they provide no specific infor-
mation about consumers' knowledge of a given drug. Meas-
ures of verbal ability or text readability are useful for
determining how challenging a given consumer will find a
given drug label, but they too provide no information about
consumers' knowledge of a given drug. Measures of the
recall of label information provide an index of what drug
facts were read and encoded, but in and of themselves, they
offer no information about how consumers understand the
drug facts they recall.
Ryan and Costello-White 13
Furthermore, our category-clustering analyses indicate that
participants appeared to be using Morrow et al.'s (1996) naïve
medication schema--Purpose, Warnings, and Directions--
rather than the schema dictated by the major headings of the
DFL--Uses, Reye's Syndrome, Allergy Alert, Stomach
Bleeding,Ask Doctor Before Use, Stop Use If, and Directions.
Morris and Aikin (2001: 515) argue that a medication schema
for nonprescription analgesics, for example, may serve as a
template to guide a consumer's reading of the DFL for a new
analgesic. However, the categories of "Ask Doctor Before Use
..." and "Stop Use If ..." call for very different consumer
actions, and those who classify them only under the broad cat-
egory of "Warnings" may fail to make distinctions that are
critical for the safe use of aspirin. Further research on the role
played by naïve medication schemas in the processing and
application of drug facts information is clearly necessary.
Label redesign.Our findings also have implications for the
design and development of drug warning labels. Although the
FDA promulgates Primary Communication Objectives for
each nonprescription drug, it is notable in the present context
that the FDA sets forth no Primary Refutation Objectives.
Morgan et al. (2002) have identified detailed procedures for
eliciting misconceptions that individuals may have about the
safe and effective use of a nonprescription drug. Conceptually
based misconceptions are not easily changed, but refutation
texts have been shown to be effective in producing those
changes (Kendeou, Walsh, Smith et al., 2014; Tippett, 2010;
Van Den Broek and Kendeou, 2008). In general, refutation
texts identify a misconception, label it as incorrect, and explain
why it is incorrect. Modifying the DFL to make it serve as a
refutation text for significant misconceptions about nonpre-
scription drugs would require a dramatic change in the product
labels for those drugs. However, a label that fails to correct
significant misconceptions about the safe and effective use of
a drug most certainly should be viewed as a defective label.
The need for refutational nonprescription drug labels calls for
a fundamental reconsideration of the primary communication
objectives of a drug label: those objectives should include
ideas to be dispelled as well as ideas to be instilled.
In addition to developing drug labels that are more effec-
tive in refuting misconceptions, it is also important to mod-
ify the text structure of those labels so that they more
explicitly reflect the "decision-making process" originally
envisioned by the FDA (1999: 13258­13259). Cook and
Mayer (1988) report that only 22percent of their undergrad-
uates could pick out and label a set of four short sequence-
of-events passages from among sets of four other kinds of
text passages. Their study indicates that young adults will
not likely be able to discern the decision-making sequence
implicit in a Drug Facts Label. However, if the headings of
the DFL are explicitly identified as steps in a process, and
the causal links among those steps are clearly stated (see
Kendou, Smith and O'Brien, 2013), consumers may be bet-
ter able to build a mental model of how to use
nonprescription drugs safely and effectively (cf. Bostrom et
al., 1994; Britton and Gülgöz, 1991).
