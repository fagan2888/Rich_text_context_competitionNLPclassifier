ABSTRACT
TUDOR-LOCKE, C., W. D. JOHNSON, and P. T. KATZMARZYK. Accelerometer-Determined Steps per Day in US Adults. Med.
Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 7, pp. 1384­1391, 2009. Introduction: The 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) released, for the first time, the ActiGraph AM-7164 accelerometer-defined step data in addition to time in intensity
(defined by activity counts). This accelerometer is known to have a lower sensitivity threshold than accepted pedometers, leading to
relatively higher step estimates. Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to provide the population- and sex-specific epidemiology of
accelerometer-determined steps per day with and without censoring steps detected at the lowest end of the activity spectrum (i.e.,
inactivity). Methods: The analysis sample represents 3744 participants Q20 yr who had at least one valid day (i.e., at least 10 h) of
monitoring. Means (SE) for steps per day were computed using all steps (i.e., uncensored) and again after censoring those steps taken at
an intensity G500 activity counts per minute (indicative of inactivity intensity). Results: On average, US adults took 9676 T 107
uncensored steps per day or 6540 T 106 censored steps per day. Conclusions: The results of this nationally representative survey
indicate that US adults take approximately 10,000 uncensored accelerometer-determined steps per day, which is improbable considering
other studies of free-living physical activity in the United States. Until a more valid conversion factor is ascertained for translating
accelerometer and pedometer-determined steps, our use of the G500 activity count per minute threshold holds considerable merit.

Physical activity assessment has benefited greatly from
the swift growth and development of body-worn
technologies, including accelerometers and pedome-
ters, which allow precise and objective quantification of
day-to-day physical activity patterns and volumes. Accel-
erometers in particular provide an output (e.g., activity
counts), which is typically interpreted using established cut
points to classify time in escalating intensities of physical
activity (i.e., from light to vigorous intensity) (7). In turn,
these outputs can be used to estimate levels of adherence to
intensity-based physical activity recommendations (16). For
example, the US National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) uses the ActiGraph AM-7164
(formerly distributed as CSA/MTI AM-7164; manufactured
by ActiGraph, Fort Walton Beach, FL) to objectively
capture free-living physical activity behaviors. On the basis
of these data, Troiano et al. (21) reported that less than 5%
of monitored adults obtained 30 minIdj1 of moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity. More recently, Matthews et al.
(13) used these data to present time spent in sedentary
behaviors.
The accelerometer model used in NHANES also has a
step counter function that provides another objective
measure of physical activity. The assessment and the
interpretation of the number of steps people take during
the course of a day are becoming more acceptable to
researchers and practitioners alike (3,17). Specifically,
distilling step data as steps per day offers a simple means
of expressing habitual daily volume of physical activity.
Previous studies have documented the validity of the
NHANES accelerometer model in terms of both intensity
(7) and step outputs (10); however, it is also known to be
more sensitive to low threshold accelerations (e.g., slow
walking) compared with highly revered research-quality
pedometers (11,22). For example, in one study of free-
living adults (22), the ActiGraph (then distributed as the
CSA) detected approximately 1800 more steps per day than
the Yamax (Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) pedometer,
suggesting that values of steps from one instrument cannot
be easily compared with the other. Unfortunately, current
dialogues revolving around ``how many steps are enough?''
have been largely reflective of pedometer-determined steps
per day, using research-quality pedometers like the Yamax
model (27). In a proof of concept study, the ActiGraph
detected approximately 17-fold more erroneous steps than
the Yamax pedometer when both were worn concurrently
during a 20-mile car drive (11). The actual manufacturer-
released sensitivity threshold (over which a step is detected)
of the ActiGraph is 0.30g compared with 0.35g of the

Yamax (22). In a manner, the higher-intensity threshold of
the Yamax pedometer censors out lower-intensity accel-
erations (i.e., does not count these as steps), effectively
capturing only the faster walking paces. An exact transla-
tion of this sensitivity threshold in terms of the ActiGraph
accelerometer steps output is not known.
The unique ability of the ActiGraph to capture both steps
and intensity data simultaneously minute by minute allows
exploration of the ``quality'' of steps taken (i.e., the number
of steps taken at each intensity level). Further, it is possible
that post hoc censoring of low-intensity steps (e.g., by using
current cut points reflective of such intensity levels) in the
NHANES data will produce an output more congruent with
pedometer-assessed expected values previously collected in
American samples (26,29). The 2005­2006 data release
represents the first NHANES opportunity to examine these
step data; previous releases did not make this particular
variable available. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis of
the 2005­2006 NHANES physical activity monitoring data
is to provide the population- and sex-specific epidemiology
of accelerometer-determined steps per day in the United
States with and without censoring steps detected at the
lower end of the activity spectrum (i.e., inactivity).
METHODS
NHANES 2005­2006. NHANES was originally de-
signed as a periodic survey of the nation's health profile.
Since 1999, it has been rolled out on a continuous basis with
related data releases in 2-yr increments. NHANES is collected
year-round and practices standardized data collection methods
to minimize the potential for error. Initially, households are
identified for inclusion and a NHANES interviewer visits the
home. Once the household interview is completed, par-
ticipants are asked to attend a mobile examination center
(MEC) to receive a health examination. Like preceding
surveys, 2005­2006 contains data from individuals selected
under a complex, multistage probability design to be a
nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized US population.
The physical activity monitor (PAM) component was
added to NHANES in 2003, and 2005­2006 is the first
release of accelerometer-determined step data in addition to
the more commonly collected and reported intensity and
duration data based on accelerometer-determined activity
counts. Participants Q6 yr were recruited for this component
in the MEC. Those who had walking impairments or other
limitations that prevented wearing an accelerometer were
excluded. The device was worn on the right hip using an
elasticized fabric belt. The accelerometers were programmed
to record information in 1-min intervals (epochs). Partic-
ipants were instructed to wear the accelerometer during
waking hours for 7 d, to remove them during any water
activities (e.g., swimming, showering, and bathing), and to
return them by prepaid mail in return for a $40 remuneration.
The 2005­2006 raw data file was released in June, 2008,
and consists of multiple records of sequential minute-by-
minute activity count and step data for each participant.
NHANES data processing and editing included review for
outliers and unreasonable values based on published litera-
ture and expert judgment. In addition to flagging data from
devices that were out of calibration upon return, a variable
was added to indicate whether data were deemed reliable or
not. Examples of data flagged as not reliable were records
containing 910 min with 1) zero steps and 9250 activity
counts per minute, 2) 9200 steps per minute, and 3) 32,767
(maximum value possible) activity counts per minute
(Captain Richard P. Troiano, personal communication).
The National Center for Health Statistics ethics review board
approved the original survey protocols, and informed
consent was obtained for all NHANES participants. The
Pennington Biomedical Research Center's institutional re-
view board approved of this secondary analysis.
Data treatment. This analysis is limited to NHANES
adult participants Q20 yr (individuals older than 85 yr were
top coded as 85) with designated reliable accelerometer data.
Time worn (hours and minutes) was computed using a SAS
macro provided by the National Cancer Institute at http://
riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/. Keeping with pre-
vious analyses (13,21), a valid day was defined as Q10 h of
wear. Previous analyses also required at least four valid days
of monitoring for determining an average value of steps per
day (21). Before accepting this threshold condition, we
analyzed the data to ascertain potential for bias. Figure 1
displays obvious bias: mean steps per day vary with valid
days worn. To emphasize, those with less than four valid
days of monitoring (n = 731) took significantly fewer
(8873 T 205 vs 9857 T 111 steps per day; independent t-test
= 5.73, P G 0.0001) steps per day than those who had four or
more valid days of monitoring (n = 3013); that is, the most
active people tended to wear the accelerometer for more days
than the least active people. We determined that by deleting
those participants with less than four valid days, the sample

mean would be inflated by approximately 1000 steps per
day. We therefore decided that it was more appropriate to
base this descriptive analysis on the 3744 participants who
had at least one valid day of monitoring. Other analyses have
also included those with at least one valid day (13).
Intensity of steps taken was anchored using activity count
cut points previously used to analyze NHANES 2003­2004
data (21). Specifically, each monitored day produced 1440
minute of records for each individual, and the activity
counts recorded in each minute were accordingly classified
based on 2020 activity counts per minute (indicating
moderate intensity equivalent to 3­5.99 METs) and 5999
activity counts per minute (indicating vigorous intensity
equivalent to Q6 METs). For these analyses, we further
stratified the lower-intensity categories (i.e., G2020 activity
counts per minute) into inactive (0­499 activity counts per
minute) and light (500­2019 activity counts per minute)
intensities in agreement with earlier analyses (22). Finally,
we adopted the Matthews et al. (13) cut point of G100
activity counts per minute to define sedentary behaviors;
which also required that we adjust the inactive intensity to
100­499 for this analysis.
Step data were recorded concurrently minute-by-minute.
Steps per minute were summed over the 1440-min day to
produce a cumulative daily record. We linked the step data
with the activity count data to identify steps taken at each
accelerometer-defined intensity. Daily steps were summed
and divided by the number of days the accelerometer was
worn to derive average steps per day. We used established
pedometer-determined physical activity cut points for healthy
adults (23) to organize steps per day­defined activity levels:
1) G5000 steps per day (``sedentary''); 2) 5000­7499 steps
per day (``low active''); 3) 7500­9999 steps per day
(``somewhat active''); 4) Q10,000­12,499 steps per day
(``active''); and 5) Q12,500 steps per day (``highly active'').
These categories were reinforced in 2008 (27). For this
analysis, we further segmented the sedentary category
into G2500 steps per day (``basal physical activity'') and
2500­4999 steps per day (``limited physical activity''). This
strategy also helped to keep the pedometer-defined sedentary
level (which encompasses basal and limited physical activity
levels) distinct from the accelerometer-defined sedentary
intensity (i.e., G100 activity counts per minute).
Analysis. All analyses were performed using procedures
for sample survey data that are readily available in the
SASÓ System for Windows Version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, 2004) to account for the complex sampling
design of NHANES. All analyses included sample weights
to account for oversampling and nonresponse to provide
nationally representative results. Sex-specific means, SE,
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for steps per day were
computed using all steps (i.e., uncensored) and again after
censoring out those steps taken at an intensity G500 activity
counts per minute. We examined the proportion of
uncensored and censored steps taken at each of the
accelerometer-determined intensities by sex. Finally, we
report the proportion of the population who were catego-
rized at each of the step-defined activity levels described
above, considering both uncensored and censored steps.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics (i.e., sex, age group, and race or
ethnicity) of adult NHANES respondents who participated
in the 2005­2006 PAM and who met the inclusion
requirements for this analysis are presented in Table 1.
The analyzed sample included 3744 (86%) of the eligible
sample of 4372 adults. Three hundred and fifty-six were
excluded based on NHANES reliability flags; 272 were
excluded because they did not meet the threshold condition
of at least 1 day with the minimum of 10 h of wear time.
Table 2 shows the mean wear time and uncensored and
censored steps per day. On average, the US sample took
9676 T 107 uncensored steps per day or 6540 T 106
censored steps per day. On average, males wore the device
30 min longer than females during the monitoring day and
took 1696 more uncensored steps per day and 1675 more
steps per day when lower-intensity steps were censored.
Figure 2 displays uncensored and censored steps per day
for males and females, segmented to show the proportion of
steps (relative to the sex-specific total) that are taken within
each accelerometer-defined intensity category. The greatest
proportion of daily steps are taken at light intensity for
males (47% of uncensored and 66.9% of censored) and
females (46.7% and 69.5%, respectively). As expected,
extremely few steps are taken at sedentary intensity, and no
steps are taken during nonwear time (which therefore does
not appear in Fig. 2). Because both sedentary and inactive
steps are not considered with censoring, these steps do not
appear under this condition, increasing the relative percen-
tages of all other intensities.
Figures 3­5 present the proportion of the population, and
by sex, who were categorized at each of the step-defined

activity levels described above, considering both uncen-
sored and censored steps. As anticipated, censoring shifts
all of the curves to the left. The modal frequency in the total
sample for uncensored steps is ``somewhat active,'' whereas
it is ``limited activity'' for the censored steps. Censoring
also attenuates the predominant peak of highly active males
that the uncensored data suggest.
DISCUSSION
The results indicate that US adults in this nationally
representative sample took approximately 10,000 uncen-
sored accelerometer-determined steps per day. This is
considerably higher than at least two US samples: Colorado
(;6800 steps per day) (29) and South Carolina (;5900 steps
per day) (26). Further, it approximates a level of steps per
day that is used to identify active individuals (23,27) and
therefore suggests that physical activity intervention is
unwarranted in this country. In reality, however, evidence
continues to accumulate that the American obesity epidemic
persists and is actually growing in magnitude unthwarted
(4,15). Further, other NHANES accelerometer estimates
(based solely on time in intensity, not steps taken) conclude
that G5% of adults adhere to public health recommendations
for physical activity (21). These incompatible results from
the same instrument administered using highly controlled
and systematic measurement protocols demand explanation.
The measurement of ``step'' is inexact and unregulated by
any authoritative body with a single exception: pedometer
quality is regulated by Japanese industry standards to a
maximum permissible miscounting error of 3% (9). It has
been previously noted that Japanese-manufactured pedome-
ters are among the most accurate instruments available to
measure steps per day (5). Outside of Japan and lacking
industry standards to guide instrument performance, manu-
facturers are independent to operationally define a step for
their own purposes. Unfortunately, enduring continued
lowering of sensitivity thresholds in a dogged pursuit of
``every step'' results in a predictable sensitivity/specificity
trade-off that blurs the more important focus on health-related
physical activity. Further, manufacturers' attempts at stan-
dardization are inevitably constrained by patents protecting
their unique designs. There are also concerns that models
within the same brand are discrepant in measurement
mechanism; new evidence derived from mechanical oscilla-
tions suggests that a newer generation of the ActiGraph

(GT1M model) than that used in NHANES is actually less
sensitive to lower force activities (18). This implies that fewer
low-intensity steps would be detected and that population
estimates of steps per day would also be lower if this newer
model were to be adopted. A head-to-head comparison of the
different generations of the ActiGraph under free-living
conditions has not yet been conducted, so again, no con-
version factor is available at this time. A solution to these
measurement issues is not straightforward and also not
within the scope of this manuscript. However, because

current steps per day recommendations (23,27) and cut
points (6,24,28) are based on the output of similarly
performing research-quality pedometers, it behooves us to
attempt to interpret the NHANES accelerometer-determined
steps per day output accordingly.
Although instrument sensitivity thresholds are known
to differ between the ActiGraph 7164 and the Yamax pe-
dometer, for example, there is not an exact method of
converting the output of one to the other. Although we pre-
viously demonstrated that the ActiGraph (then distributed as
the CSA) detected approximately 1800 more steps per day
than the Yamax pedometer in a small free-living sample (22),
we felt it was too simplistic to apply this single strategy
uniformly to all NHANES PAM participants in a broad-
handed attempt to make their accelerometer-determined
steps per day appear more congruent with that of research-
quality pedometers. A more acceptable strategy would
consider each individual's unique activity patterns and
would attempt to censor out excessive low-force acceler-
ations that are more likely to be picked up by this
accelerometer (11,22). Obviously, our decision to censor
those steps taken G500 activity counts per minute was
arbitrary. However, faced with no exact conversion factor,
we believe that it was a logical choice. Extrapolating from
work done by Barnett and Cerin (2), 500 activity counts per
minute is approximately equal to walking at 2.7 kmIhj1 or
1.7 milesIhj1. Interpreting a figure provided by Matthews
(12) gives a good indication of the types of ambulatory
activities that would fall below 500 activity counts per
minute, for example, steps undertaken while cooking,
ironing, washing dishes, grocery shopping, laundry, and
light cleaning. We did consider censoring those steps taken
at G100 activity counts per minute, following the study of
sedentary time by Matthews et al. (13). However, using this
cut point reduced total estimates by only 557 steps per day
(because very few steps are detected when sitting is
implied). We also considered censoring out all those steps
taken at less than moderate intensity (i.e., at G2020 activity
counts per minute); however, this drastically reduced steps
per day estimates to 1828 T 64, which was not plausible
either. Until a more valid conversion factor is ascertained
for translating accelerometer and pedometer-determined
steps, our use of the G500 activity count per minute
threshold holds considerable merit.
It is important to disclose here that the previous acceler-
ometer analysis focused on time in moderate to vigorous
intensity (21), indicating that G5% of US adults were
achieving recommended amounts of physical activity. As
indicated above, even our conservative use of censored steps
leaves us with an estimate of 31% taking Q7500 steps per
day (``somewhat active'' to ``highly active''). It is apparent
that the decision rules that count only minimal 10-min bouts
above set activity counts per minute are much more re-
strictive than the allowance for accumulation of a volume of
steps taken over the course of a day. Perhaps the literal trans-
lation of a recommendation primarily based on self-report
(21) is too narrow to reflect what may truly be healthful
physical activity. This is, of course, pure speculation in an
attempt to reconcile vastly discrepant conclusions. Continued
research using multiple instruments and/or cross-tabulated

examination of different outputs (e.g., step and activity count)
within the same instrument will likely provide additional
insight into these measurement conundrums.
Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, like
other waist-mounted motion sensors, the ActiGraph is most
sensitive to ambulatory activity (i.e., walking), missing
upper body movements, load carrying, and water activities
(the latter of which requires removal of the instrument).
However, walking is the most prevalent form of leisure time
physical activity in the United States (20) and is a
functional part of daily life (25). Further, those activities
most likely to be missed (e.g., swimming, aqua-fitness,
bicycling) or underestimated (e.g., weight-training, yoga)
by waist-mounted motion sensors are infrequently per-
formed (8). Attempts to adjust for nonambulatory steps
taken for these types of activity are unwarranted in terms of
population estimates (14).
Second, there are many different activity count cut-point
values that have been used to ascertain moderate and/or
vigorous physical activity using this particular accelerometer.
For example, the choice of cut point will affect classification of
moderate-intensity steps; a lower cut point (e.g., 1952 (7) vs
2020 used herein) will shift more light-intensity steps into the
moderate-intensity category. We decided it was most appro-
priate to use the same cut points that had been previously used
with the NHANES data (21).
Third, the question of ``how many days'' should a motion
sensor be worn to achieve a valid and reliable estimate
of habitual activity continues to be debated (1). Before
accepting a previously implemented threshold of 4 d (21),
we examined the relationship between steps per day and
days monitored and discovered a pattern suggesting a self-
selection bias. As indicated above, the most active people
tended to wear the accelerometer for more days, and the
least active people wore it for fewer days. Although it is
tempting to eliminate those at the lower end, basing the
argument on presumed lack of compliance, this act inflates
physical activity estimates by screening out the most
sedentary individuals. Wearing a physical activity monitor
is not a blind experience. We speculate that it is plausible
that those who are most active enjoy showing this and are
therefore readily compliant with the regimen. In contrast,
the most sedentary can easily realize that this is a physical
activity monitor, and because they do not typically do any
physical activity, they may grow weary of the whole point
of wearing the instrument at all and therefore give up ear-
lier. Put another way, fewer days of wear may be a reason-
able proxy estimate for a sedentary lifestyle.
Finally and along these lines also falls the question
concerning minimal time worn: how long must a PAM be
worn to capture a valid day of physical activity? The worry
is that we will miss physical activity performed when the
motion sensor is not attached. Schmidt et al. (19) performed
a thorough examination of this question in regards to
pedometer time worn. They assessed alternative methods
for adjusting for wear time and also evaluated the
relationship between steps and associated biological mea-
sures (e.g., BMI, waist circumference, and systolic blood
pressure) to determine whether any manner of adjustment
improved correlations observed using the raw data. None of
the adjustment methods used produced substantially stron-
ger associations. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that
error related to wear time is dependent on participants'
activity level when not wearing the pedometer; if those
people who wear it for a short time also do little physical
activity when it is off, then the magnitude of error is
minimal. They also asserted that adjusting for wear time
using a stepping rate (e.g., steps per hour) might actually
overestimate physically activity in those individuals with a
short wear time who are not active after they take off the
pedometer. It is our speculation that those who are
physically active are reluctant to remove a motion sensor
that is able to capture their lifestyle. Further, those who are
more physically inactive are likely to remove the device
early if they believe that it has nothing more to assess (i.e.,
it is not relevant) in their typically sedentary day.
In summary, the ActiGraph AM-7164 used in the 2005­
2006 NHANES offers both accelerometer-defined step data
in addition to time in intensity (defined by activity counts).
Because this accelerometer is known to detect more low-
force movements than accepted research-quality pedome-
ters, this analysis examined population- and sex-specific
descriptive epidemiology of accelerometer-determined steps
per day with and without censoring steps detected at
the lowest end of the activity spectrum (i.e., inactivity).
The uncensored values obtained are almost 3000 steps per
day more than what might be expected compared with other
pedometer-based studies of free-living physical activity
in the United States. Censoring these accelerometer data
using a defensible activity count per minute cut point
provides a distribution that is more in line with current
understanding. Further cross-examination of these robust
objectively monitored data is warranted to advance under-
standing of patterns of physical activity and inactivity in
the United States.
