Introduction
Outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
(OHCA) has markedly improved in the past
years.1­3 While the overall mortality rate is still con-
siderable, the patients who do survive tend to have
a good neurological outcome.4­6 Many studies have
focused on short-term outcome after OHCA,7­11
and studies on the elderly have increased during the
past years.12­18 Since older studies reported dismal
outcomes in elderly patients after cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR),19 there still may be reluctance
to institute maximal treatment in all patients for
fear of only generating a greater number of survi-
vors with poor functional outcomes.20,21

Abstract
Background: Over the past decade, prehospital and in-hospital treatment for out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA) has improved considerably. There are sparse data on the long-term
outcome, especially in elderly patients. We studied whether elderly patients benefit to the
same extent compared with younger patients and at long-term follow up as compared with the
general population.
Methods: Between 2001 and 2010, data from all patients presented to our hospital after
OHCA were recorded. Elderly patients (75 years) were compared with younger patients.
Neurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital
discharge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival
rates of the general population.
Results: Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return
of spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 ± 5
years. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with
rates of 33% versus 57% (p < 0.001). A CPC of 1 was present in 73% of the elderly patients
versus 86% of the younger patients (p = 0.031). In 7.3% of the elderly patients, a CPC >2 was
observed versus 2.5% of their younger counterparts (p = 0.103). Elderly patients had a median
survival of 6.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0­7.9] years compared with 7.7 (95% CI 7.5­7.9)
years of the general population (p = 0.019).
Conclusions: The survival rate after OHCA in elderly patients is approximately half that
of younger patients. Elderly patients who survive to discharge frequently have favorable
neurological outcomes and a long-term survival that approximates that of the general
population.

Several recent studies show that with increasing
age, short-term survival decreases but survivors
display a good neurologic outcome.13­15 Long-
term survival after OHCA seems to approach the
general population,22­25 but little is known on the
long-term survival of elderly patients who survive
until hospital discharge.16­18 To what extent
elderly OHCA patients benefit from early treat-
ment as compared with younger patients and the
general population was investigated in the current
study.
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
The University Medical Center Groningen
(UMCG) is the main tertiary referral hospital for
the north-eastern part of the Netherlands, which
provides 24/7 emergency care in a region with
750,000 inhabitants.26 It operates in combination
with multiple emergency medical services (EMS)
in this area. A driver with a paramedical back-
ground and a nurse staff each ambulance, and
both are trained and qualified to perform
Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) accord-
ing to the European Resuscitation Council guide-
lines, such as advanced airway interventions,
administration of inotropic drugs and use of a
defibrillator.27 In case of resuscitation, a backup
ambulance is always sent. The nurse staff always
commences CPR but has the discretion to dis-
continue if the patient has a `do not attempt CPR'
decision or a nonshockable rhythm present for
more than 20 minutes. Except for these patients,
all other OHCAs including EMS-witnessed
arrests are transported to our center where resus-
citation is continued or postresuscitation care is
given following ACLS guidelines.27 When patients
present with an ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) after OHCA we perform per-
cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients
with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),
including elderly patients.28 Patients requiring
continuous mechanical ventilation were trans-
ferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postre-
suscitation care. Treatment was left at the
discretion of the attending physicians. If brain-
stem reflexes (i.e. absent pupillary light response
and corneal reflexes) and motor scores were
absent, no further life-sustaining treatment was
delivered. In all other cases, additional soma-
tosensory-evoked-potential (SSEP) monitoring
was done and in the case of absent bilateral nega-
tive 20 (N20) SSEPs, active treatment was also
withdrawn. Electroencephalography (EEG) anal-
ysis was performed when seizures or myoclonus
was present. Seizures were treated with antiepi-
leptic drugs; in the case of myoclonus status epilep-
ticus, treatment was also stopped.29,30 In these
patients, active therapies were discontinued, and
treatment was altered to comfort care. The insti-
tutional review board [Medisch Ethische
Toetsingscommissie (METc) of the UMCG]
approved the study and waived the need for
informed consent due to the observational nature
of the study (METc 2011.374).
Patients
We studied all adult ( 18 years) patients who
were transferred to our hospital after OHCA dur-
ing the years 2001­2010. Data were collected ret-
rospectively from the medical records of the
Ambulance System. During the study period,
mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) was initi-
ated if patients had a Glasgow Coma Score < 8.
These patients were cooled to 32­34°C for 24 h
and thereafter, passively rewarmed to 36°C.
In this cohort, we defined patients with an age of
 75 years as elderly and used the younger patients
for comparison of outcomes in both categories.
Data on prehospital characteristics, medical his-
tory, electrocardiography (ECG), SSEP, EEG
and laboratory values were gathered from the
hospital information system. Neurological status
was classified using the cerebral performance cat-
egory (CPC) from the clinical patient notes made
during outpatient follow-up assessments by cardi-
ologists, rehabilitation specialists or, when indi-
cated, neurologists. Survival status of patients
discharged alive was obtained from the municipal
personal records database on 20 December 2017,
with a maximum follow up of 16.4 years.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are presented as either means ±
standard deviation for normally distributed varia-
bles or medians and interquartile ranges for
skewed data, or as group percentages with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables.
We determined outcome in subgroups dependent
on initial rhythm [ventricular fibrillation (VF) ver-
sus no-VF] and implemented treatment (PCI ver-
sus no PCI, MTH versus no MTH). We recorded
age, sex and known factors associated with out-
come: initial rhythm and in-hospital treatment
(PCI and MTH) and left ventricular function.
B Hiemstra, R Bergman et al.

Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-
square test for categorical and the Mann­
Whitney U test or Student's t test for skewed
continuous and normally distributed variables,
respectively. Kaplan­Meier survival analysis was
used to assess long-term survival and the log-
rank test was used to compare survival across
subgroups. For each OHCA patient, the actual
survival was compared with the predicted sur-
vival rates of the general population standard-
ized for age, sex and calendar year. These
predicted survival rates were obtained from the
Dutch Census Bureau, which predicts general
population survival annually.31 We identified
independent predictors of in-hospital mortality,
coronary angiography (CAG), PCI and MTH
using multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Univariable analyses were conducted on all
known predictors for mortality, which were
added without any transformation. A p < 0.25
was used for inclusion in the multivariable
model. Calibration of the multivariable models
was checked with Hosmer­Lemeshow tests and
by plotting observed proportions against the
predicted risks of 10 equally sized groups. We
used complete-case analyses because all variables
in our multivariable models had fewer than 5%
missing values.32 Statistical significance was
defined as a two-sided p value of < 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed with Stata version 15.1
(StataCorp, 2017, College Station, Texas:
StataCorp LLC).
Results
Prehospital characteristics of all admitted
patients
From 2001 to 2010, a total of 810 patients were
admitted after OHCA (Figure 1). Of these, 188
(23%) patients were  75 years with a mean age
of 81 ± 5 years. Baseline and clinical character-
istics of patients aged < 75 years and  75 years
are presented in Table 1. The location of arrest
differed between both groups and elderly
patients less frequently had an initial rhythm of
VF. There was no difference between the two
age groups in the fraction of patients who

achieved ROSC, although upon arrival at the
emergency department, younger patients more
often had achieved ROSC. Elderly patients also
had an increased incidence of prior cardiovascu-
lar disease and risk factors. More specifically,
elderly patients were more frequently known
with a previous myocardial infarction, cerebro-
vascular accident, hypertension, diabetes and
concurrent malignancy.
In-hospital characteristics of patients who
achieved return of spontaneous circulation
Table 2 summarizes the clinical characteristics,
angiography data and outcome of the patients who
achieved ROSC. After ROSC, the initial Glasgow
Coma Scores were equally low in the elderly and
younger cohort, with median scores of 3 (3­5) and
3 (3­6), p = 0.358, respectively. Elderly patients
underwent fewer primary CAGs, were less often
diagnosed with a STEMI, had smaller creatine
kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin T
levels and presented with higher N-terminal pro-
hormoneofbrainnatriureticpeptide(NT-proBNP)
levels (p < 0.001 for all). There were no
differences in glucose, lactate, pH, and base
excess between these groups. Among the elderly,
CAG was associated with an initial rhythm of
VF, an ST-segment elevation on the ECG and
higher arterial pH levels at admission
(Supplementary Table 1).
Treatment
Only 31 patients (25%) from the elderly group
underwent PCI versus 184 patients (43%) in the
younger group (p < 0.001). In both younger and
elderly patients, independent predictors of PCI
were the presence of ST-segment elevation on the
ECG and higher serum CK-MB levels
[Supplementary Table 2(a), 2(b)]. MTH was
similarly used in the elderly (32%, 95% CI 24­
41%) and younger (38%, 95% CI 33­43%)
patients (p = 0.277). In the elderly, an initial
rhythm of VF and higher serum CK-MB levels
were independently associated with institution of
MTH (Supplementary Table 3). There were no
statistically significant differences in the use of an
intra-aortic balloon pump and mechanical venti-
lation between both groups (Table 2).

Outcome
Survival to hospital discharge was lower in
elderly patients with only 33% (95% CI 25­42%)
surviving compared with 57% (95% CI 52­62%)
in the younger group (p < 0.001; Table 2). Being
elderly was independently associated with in-hos-
pital mortality when adjusted for known prognos-
tic factors [i.e. sex, initial rhythm, bystander CPR,
witnessed arrest, arterial glucose and pH levels,
and prior CVD (Supplementary Table 4)]. Of the
41 elderly patients who survived to hospital dis-
charge, 24 (59%, 95% CI 42­74%) had VF versus
17 (41%, 95% CI 26­58%) patients with non-VF
(p = 0.600). In younger patients, survival in the
VF group was 207 (86%, 95% CI 81­90%) versus
35 (15%, 95% CI 10­20%) in the non-VF patients
(p < 0.001). Only Glasgow Coma Score at admis-
sion was independently associated with mortality
in the elderly (Supplementary Table 5). Length of
hospital stay was shorter in the elderly patients
(Table 2), but length of hospital stay was similar
for hospital survivors in both groups.
After hospital discharge, survival in elderly
patients was worse in comparison with younger
patients (Figure 2). The 1-year survival in the
overall OHCA group after hospital discharge was
94% (95% CI 91­97%) and 5-year survival was
Therapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 00(0)

still 85% (95% CI 80­89%). In contrast, in the
patients aged  75 years, 1-year survival was only
76% (95% CI 60­88%) and 5-year survival
dropped to 59% (95% CI 42­74%). However,
when standardized for sex, age and calendar year,
long-term survival approached that of the general
population (Figure 3). The median survival of the
elderly patients was 6.5 (95% CI 2.0­7.9) years
compared with 7.7 (95% CI 7.5­7.9) years for a
matched general population (p = 0.019).
Neurological outcome at hospital discharge
The younger cohort had a better neurological
outcome, as scored by the CPC (Table 2). In
the elderly, 73% (95% CI 57­86%) had a CPC
of 1 compared with 86% (95% CI 81­90%) in
the younger patients (p = 0.031). The inci-
dence of poor outcome (CPC > 2) was 7.3%
(95% CI 1.5­20%) in the elderly versus 2.5%
(95% CI 0.9­5.3%) in the younger cohort (p =
0.103).

Cause of death
Causes of in-hospital death did not vary substan-
tially between age groups (Table 2). The major
cause of death was neurological damage that was
deemed not compatible with survival. Other
important causes of death were secondary circu-
latory failure and multiorgan failure (Table 2). Of
the 35 patients with a known malignancy, only
one survived until end of follow up (p = 0.003).
Discussion
From the long-term follow up of a cohort of 810
patients after OHCA, two main observations
emerged. First, despite similar percentages of
patients regaining spontaneous circulation, in-
hospital mortality was considerably higher in
elderly compared with younger patients. Second,
we add to the current literature, that elderly
patients who were discharged alive had a median
survival of 6.5 years compared with 7.7 years in
matched controls in the general population.
Moreover, in these elderly patients, the neuro-
logical outcome was good in a high percentage of
patients, with less than 10% with a poor neuro-
logical outcome.
Our findings confirm that elderly patients have
worse outcomes than younger patients: Funada
and colleagues studied 334,730 elderly ( 75
years) and 23,520 very elderly ( 95 years)
patients,12,33 and in 2017, five more studies
described worse outcomes of elderly patients after
1 month: Aissaoui and colleagues (n = 464,  65
years),34 Andrew and colleagues (n = 14,678,
 65 years),18 Segal and colleagues (n = 18,249,
> 65 years),14 Sulzgruber and colleagues (n =
1315,  65 years),15 and Wiel and colleagues
(n = 4347, > 65 years).13 In a study with 34,291
patients Wong and colleagues showed in 2014
that over time, the survival of the elderly at 1 year
has increased.36 The favorable outcome trend for
functional outcome reflected by good CPC scores
at 1 month was recently shown in large Japanese
cohort studies.12,37,38 Beesems and colleagues
showed worse survival and equally favorable
functional outcome in survivors compared with
our study.39 In 1332 patients aged  70 years,
1-year survival in patients discharged alive was
88% and neurologic outcome, as defined by a
CPC of 1 or 2, was good in 90% of patients.
Winther-Jensen and colleagues showed that 70%
of the very elderly patients (i.e.  80 years) had
CPC scores of 1 or 2 at 30-day follow up, which
is comparable with the observed 70% elderly with
a CPC score of 1 in our cohort.17 Studies are
unanimous on the worse short-term outcome of
elderly after OHCA, but we observe that healthy
aging among the survivors seems possible.
In our study, several factors were associated with
both mortality and unfavorable neurological out-
come. In line with observations of others, the
elderly have a higher cardiovascular risk profile and
more comorbidities.39­41 We also observed a higher
incidence of an initial rhythm other than VF, which
is associated with a poor outcome, in the elderly
patients.42 Similar to Sulzgruber and colleagues,
the initial rhythm and other known prognostic fac-
tors such as witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, arte-
rial glucose, base excess and lactate levels were not
associated with outcome in the elderly.15 More
data are needed to identify early prognostic varia-
bles, as other cohort studies did find associations
between these variables and outcome.6,42­44
Compared with other studies, the incidence of
ROSC in the elderly in our population was high
and almost equal to younger patients.47,48 A selec-
tion bias could be present as referral to our hospi-
tal may have been considered futile in patients
with very poor early prognostic variables or a non-
shockable rhythm present for more than 20 min-
utes. Like in the study of Winther-Jensen and
colleagues, CAG and PCI were employed less
frequently in the elderly patients.17 Our data show
that in elderly patients, OHCA less frequently has
an acute cardiac origin. Elderly patients less often
suffer from a myocardial infarction, initial rhythm
of VF and have lower cardiac biomarkers. Also,
the higher incidence of previous myocardial
infarction in the elderly might underlie secondary
rhythm disturbances that cause OHCA. The dif-
ferent underlying pathology makes them less suit-
able for treatment such as PCI.6,49,50 Another
reason could be that elderly patients tend to
receive a less aggressive diagnostic work up com-
pared with younger patients.13,51­53 MTH was
employed equally in both groups in our cohort.
Treatment decisions can be particularly difficult
for clinicians caring for elderly patients. CPR for
older patients is a controversial issue.16,54,55 Initiating
CPR in the elderly is a decision that is affected by
sometimes conflicting opinions for what is best
for the patient, and these opinions may vary from
country to country. It involves not only medical,
but also ethical decisions, especially when there
are important associated comorbidities that
directly affect the patient's prognosis.21 As shown

in our study, the incidence of malignancies is sig-
nificantly higher in the elderly. Since long-term
survival of elderly hospital survivors is reasonable
with a median survival of 6.5 years, our data thus
do not support the withholding of resuscitation
based on age only.16
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, it was per-
formed retrospectively on data of patients admitted
to our hospital. Detailed data are lacking on the
personwhowitnessedthearrest(EMSorbystander)
and time frames of initial treatment, such as time to
CPR, ACLS and ROSC for instance. Second, not
all treatment was standardized; various potential
sources of unidentified bias such as confounding by
indication in the care of older and younger patients
may be present. However, highlighting this poten-
tial bias is also an important finding in this study.
Finally, these results only relate to patients present-
ing to the emergency unit of a single center. This
limits the external validity of our findings. Some
patients who were resuscitated during the study
period in our region may not have been referred to
our hospital, since PCI was not deemed necessary
for some patients. This may explain differences in
our patient population in comparison with other
studies.10,56 As such, the outcome data we present
do not pertain to the total population of patients
suffering OHCA in our region.
Conclusion
Despite similar rates of ROSC after OHCA in
elderly and younger patients, hospital survival for
elderly patients was approximately half that of
younger patients. However, the majority of elderly
patients who survived initial treatment had a CPC
score of 1 and a lifespan that approximates that of
the general population.
