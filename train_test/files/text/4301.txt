Introduction
This article is based on a study done by a team of Biology
and Lower Secondary Science teachers of a public secondary
school in Singapore with a student population of about 1,120.
The Lower Secondary Science course is offered to Secondary
1 and Secondary 2 (Grades 7 and 8 equivalent) students. A
major component of the Lower Secondary Science course is
designed around developing inquiry through engaging in sci-
entific investigations and processes (Ministry of Education,
Singapore, 2012). Besides engaging in hands-on science
laboratory work, most pen-and-paper science questions are
crafted along experiments (Figure 1).
A core facet of science is the ability to construct explana-
tions from interpreting evidences or texts and assessing
claims (Driver, Newton, & Osborne, 2000). The ability to
derive proper scientific explanations encompasses the goal
of inquiry learning because it involves understanding the
phenomena and convincing others of the same understanding
(Sandoval & Reiser, 2004). Students' engagement in con-
struction of scientific explanation may promote a positive
outlook on science as well as increase their understanding of
scientific content (Bell & Linn, 2000; Zohar & Nemet, 2002).
We noticed that our lower secondary students find it chal-
lenging to interpret experimental data. Generally, students
have a few challenges in answering data-based questions: (a)
inability to describe the data (Figure 2) and (b) inability to
infer and interpret the data (Figure 3).
For the first challenge (Figure 2), our students tend to
generalize loosely and prematurely in their written answers.
Most students fail to put in effort to describe the pattern(s)
offered by the data in a given question (Sandoval, 2003).
Instead of using the data provided, students often rely on
their personal views, textbook knowledge, and beliefs to
draw conclusions (Hogan & Maglienti, 2001). For instance,
as depicted in Figure 2, the student answered by using
"affects" to describe the effect of increasing water tempera-
ture on the amount of solute that can be dissolved in the
water without clear mention of what exactly the effect was.
In the case of the second challenge, our students were
unable to understand the intention of the data. As illustrated
in Figure 3, the student was neither able to provide a reason-
ing nor make a reference to a taught theory; the student failed

Expanded Understandings of the
Connective Approach in Helping
Students Construct Scientific
Explanations
Deborah Goh1
Abstract
The connective approach is developed by Sir Peter Strawson, emeritus professor of philosophy at Oxford University, as an
effective way to understand the fundamental structure of human thinking in the field of analytical philosophy. This article
provides insights for extending the work of Strawson, Tay, and Tay et al. to education, in particular, how we can equip
students with the requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions for answering science questions. The connective approach uses
three dimensions, namely, ontology, epistemology, and logic. The scaffolding strategy that we have developed, consisting of
DINE (whereby "D" is describe, "IN" is interpret, "E" is evaluate), the logic dimension; Bite-Size Teaching, the epistemological
dimension; and focal lesson, the ontological dimension, is an integrated network of connected concepts that enable students
to construct arguments and explanations needed for phenomena at a higher level of complexity. This article also extends the
use of the connective approach to learning in social constructivist classrooms.

to link the question to the concept of air pressure in the inner
and outer ear. As pointed out by Chinn and Brewer (2001),
our students' understanding of content knowledge and data
evidence in question affects whether they are able to provide
appropriate evidence for a particular task. Students are also
likely to ignore data that contradict the theoretical knowl-
edge they already know, and they are more likely to take data
into account if they can visualize the concept behind the data
pattern. Therefore, the need for stronger content knowledge
and exposure to data patterns may help students improve
their understanding for the underlying intention of a given
science question.
Scaffolding, as described by Wood, Bruner, and Ross
(1976), consists of an adult manipulating the elements of
task that are beyond the learner's ability, so that the learner is
able to focus on and achieve competence in the fundamentals
within his or her capacity. A number of researchers (Brown
& Palincsar, 1987; Stone, 1993) have made the connection
that scaffolding allows learners to reach a higher level of
understanding for task within their zone of proximal devel-
opment (ZPD). According to Vygotsky's (1978) theory, the
ZPD defines the area where a learner is able to solve prob-
lems independently and attain a potential level of problem-
solving capabilities with guidance. For a scaffold to serve its
function well, it should reside within the learner's ZPD. If
the scaffold provides too much assistance, the learner will
not be challenged to inquire more. Hence, the scaffold should
provide just enough assistance so that the learner will be able
to progress independently and achieve a higher level of
understanding (Vygotsky, 1978).
In the past, we have tried to explain the answering of
experimental-based questions on a question-by-question
basis. This may have led to some students memorizing
answers to specific questions. There are studies indicating
that the ability to craft scientific explanations does not come
naturally to most individuals; instead, it is mostly assimilated
through practice (Osborne, Erduran, & Simon, 2004).
Therefore, students should be explicitly taught the skill on
how to craft accurate scientific explanations, and this should
be practiced regularly in science lessons.
Connective Approach in Construction
of Scientific Explanations
The connective approach is developed by Sir Peter Strawson,
emeritus professor of philosophy at Oxford University, as an
effective way to understand the fundamental structure of
human thinking in the field of analytical philosophy. At the
heart of the connective approach are the three distinct dimen-
sions of ontology, epistemology, and logic (Strawson, 1992;
Tay, 2003; Tay et al., 2010). These dimensions are identified
by Strawson (1992) as the three dimensions of a unified
enquiry. Figure 4 shows how epistemology, ontology, and
logic can be represented.
The meaning of the three dimensions is described by Tay
et al. (2010) as follows:
Ontology [sic] is defined by Reber (1995) and Zuber-Skerritt
(2001) as an aspect of metaphysical inquiry concerned with the
question of existence apart from specific objects and events. It is

one's assumptions about the nature of being and reality. As
pointed out by Nita (1999), ontology takes on two meanings.
The first meaning takes reference to the real world, where
experience is characterized in terms of what is "out there." The
second meaning includes belief in the existence of the things in
question such that these things are separated and related in time
and space. (p. 2)
Epistemology [sic] is defined by Reber (1995) and Zuber-
Skerritt (2001) as the branch of philosophy that is concerned
with the origins, nature, methods and limits of human knowledge.
It is our assumptions about the nature of knowledge and
knowing. As pointed out by Nita (1999), epistemology is either
something objective, to be accumulated independently of the
perceptions of any particular observer or something subjective,
a product created by the observer. In other words, epistemology
is the use of concepts in judgement or belief. It refers to the
personal and subjective phenomenon. The experience is
characterized in terms of what is "in the head" of humans. (p. 2)
In Strawson's view [sic], logic is the study of the general forms
of the proposition and of their relations of logical dependence
and independence. It has no concern with the internal structure
of uncompounded propositions that enter into its compounds.
It has nothing to say about the content of logically simple
propositions. It has nothing to do with an ontological order.
According to Bench-Capon (1990), the main concern of logic
is with the soundness and unsoundness of arguments. Its goal
is to represent an argument in such a way that it will be
uncontroversial as to whether that argument is acceptable or
not. (p. 3)
The above literature prompts us to develop an adopted
collective approach consisting of aspects to the three
domains: ontology, epistemology, and logic. The ontological
dimension can be represented by experiential focal lessons.
The epistemological dimension can be represented by the set
of pre-requisite knowledge taught to students in class. The
logic dimension refers to the instructional method to scaffold
students in crafting scientific explanations.
In addition, as pointed out by Strawson (1992), the con-
cepts to be included in the connective approach must be
highly general, irreducible, and non-contingent.

First,theterm"general"isdescribedbyReber(1985/1995)
and Tay (2003) as a judgment or decision that is applicable to
an entire class or category of objects, events, or phenomena.
For example, the word "flower" can be used as a general
term to refer to the bud, the stalk, the leaves, and the root.
The three dimensions adopted in this research study are gen-
eral in nature. The experiential "Focal Lesson" is based on
the general theory of being. It applies the notion of ontology
by ensuring all its phenomena take reference to the real
world. All the phenomena observed by students must be
found in the physical setting associated with that focal les-
son. The set of pre-requisite knowledge adopts the general
theory of knowledge. It represents the collective body of
information where students can use the underlying nouns,
verbs, phrases, or sentences to construct their concepts or
explanations. The instructional method uses the general the-
ory of proposition. It is concerned with what is true or false.
Second, as pointed out by Tay (2003), the term "irreduc-
ibility" does not mean or imply "simple." A concept may be
complex, in the sense that its elucidation requires the estab-
lishment of its connections with other concepts. At the same
time, it is also irreducible, in the sense that it cannot be
defined away, without circularity, in terms of those other
concepts to which it is necessarily related. All the three
dimensions in this research study are irreducible. This is
based on the fact that against judgments or beliefs derived
from pre-requisite knowledge is the natural world or the
physical setting associated with a respective focal lesson to
which the judgments or beliefs relate. To determine whether
the judgments or beliefs are true or false, the instructional
method is required by students to process the states gathered
from the relations of judgments or beliefs derived from pre-
requisite knowledge with that of the natural world associated
with the focal lesson.
Third, the term "non-contingency" is defined by Reber
(1985/1995) and Tay (2003) as something strengthened by
an event. It is considered to be the learned response of a bond
between that response and stimulus. It occurs independently
of any behavior. It has a role to play in the development and
maintenance of that behavior. Beyond that, the very concept
of experience itself would be lost. The adopted three dimen-
sions are non-contingent. Each element contains a distinct
feature that is non-contingent. The focal lesson is concerned
with things that are "out there." A pre-requisite knowledge is
concerned with things that are "in the heads" of humans. The
instructional method is only concerned with the reasoning
process. It interprets neither the content of the things in a
focal lesson nor the concepts derived from pre-requisite
knowledge.
Therefore, during the processing of applying our derived
approach, the students traverse through an elaborate network
of connected objects and concepts that enables students to
construct an explanation concisely and comprehensively and
also to be able to interpret observed phenomena systemically
and at higher level of complexity.
This article focuses on the feasibility of implementing the
connective approach in helping lower secondary science stu-
dents construct scientific explanations for experimental-based
questions in science. The concepts and theories relevant to
this study are presented in the following sections:

Derivation of Scaffolding Strategy
First Aspect: Developing the Appropriate
Instructional Method for Crafting Scientific
Explanations
Prior to our research study, the art curriculum in Singapore
has already adopted Feldman's (1967) method of art criti-
cism as a simple four-step method for evaluating a work of
art. It comprises the following:
1. Description: Listing what an art object seems to
include
2. Formal analysis: Describing the relationship among
the things that were listed
3. Interpretation: Deciding what all your earlier obser-
vation means
4. Judgment: Deciding the value of an art object
We noticed the similarities behind the Feldman thinking
model of art criticism and constructing scientific explana-
tions. Hence, we decided to adapt Feldman's model instead
of using it directly, with a view to make it more accessible to
lower secondary students for learning science. Besides, we
also intentionally reduced the complexity of experimental-
based questions for students with a view that students can
collaborate among themselves in deriving valid scientific
explanation (Wood et al., 1976).
As a result, we created an instructional model (DINE)
consisting of three elements for thinking:
1. Describe--State what you have observed (adapted
from 1 of Feldman's method). For example, what
general trends does the graph show? What are the
highest and lowest points on the graph? What changes
were seen in the set-up?
2. Interpret--What does your observation mean?
(adapted from 2 and 3 of Feldman's method). For
example, explain the relationship between the vari-
ables. How does the dependent variable (y-axis) vary
with the independent variable (x-axis)? How does one
variable affect the other variables to cause changes?
Goh 5
3. Evaluate--How does your observation relate to the-
ory/scientific concepts? (adapted from 4 of Feldman's
method). For example, justify the decision, or explain
the concept using theories you have learnt. Why does
the graph show such a trend? Why do the changes
happen in the setup? Are the results expected accord-
ing to concept?
In addition, a DINE poster (Online Appendix A) was
printed for every science classroom and exhibited on the
classroom walls. It is a step toward making DINE more vis-
ible in classrooms that hopefully increases the frequency of
its use. Students were taught the use of DINE directly in
classrooms through exemplars of experimental-based ques-
tions (Online Appendix A).
Second Aspect: Preparation of Bite-Size Notes for
Teaching Pre-Requisite Knowledge
Student epistemology influences the learning experiences
students have and affects student learning (Hogan &
Maglienti, 2001). As such, we took into consideration the
prior knowledge of our target students who had just gradu-
ated from primary school and incorporated additional infor-
mation on a "need-to-know" basis, with focus on context that
can help students move forward in their inquiry during the
scaffolding lesson. For example, pre-requisite knowledge for
Focal Lesson 1 includes the concept of osmosis, relevant
practical skills, laboratory safety procedures, and use of an
online platform like Google documents for collaboration.
Third Aspect: Design of Focal Lessons
We designed two laboratory-based science experiments as
focal lessons where students were able to collect their own
data and derive their explanations to data. We were mindful
that the tasks in the focal lessons were pitched at the right
level for the students--tasks that are too difficult are outside
the students' ZPD, and tasks that are too easy will leave the
students unmotivated. The core difference between the two
focal lessons is that the first focal lesson is a laboratory
experiment largely based on a scientific concept of osmosis
where students develop explanations based on divergence
from accepted scientific theory, while the second focal les-
son allows students to design their own experiment and
develop their own scientific explanations. These lessons will
be elaborated in the next section.
Fourth Aspect: Developing Domain Pre-Test and
Post-Test
Pen-and-paper assessment tests based on domain knowledge
were developed and administered to students before the
administration of DINE instructional strategy and after the
administration of DINE instructional strategy, respectively.
These assessments included data-based questions in both mul-
tiple-choice questions and structured questions (Figures 1-3).
Through this, we wanted to assess how the preparation and
teaching of domain knowledge together with the logic dimen-
sion, DINE instructional strategy, affect learning science.
Fifth Aspect: Adaptation of University of New
South Wales (UNSW) Non-Domain Pre-Test and
Post-Test
We adapted 10 multiple-choice questions extracted from the
International Competitions and Assessments for Schools
(ICAS) science papers administered by the UNSW from
years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2007 (Online Appendix
B). The ICAS questions were chosen because the questions
assess students' skills in the key scientific areas of interpret-
ing data, applying data, and higher order skills (http://www.
eaa.unsw.edu.au/forms/pdf/icas/subjects/science-frame-
work.pdf). We administered this test before the explicit
teaching of DINE to understand their pre-analytical ability
for experimental data-based questions and administered the
same test after the DINE implementation period to check for
improvement in their post-analytical ability. It is important to
note that we did not conduct any pre-knowledge lessons to
students for these extracted UNSW questions. This fifth
aspect was introduced to find out whether students were able
to use DINE alone to analyze scientific data beyond their
epistemological and conceptual knowledge.
Intervention of Scaffolding Strategy
The two focal lessons were carried out accordingly in chron-
ological order and administered to all four Secondary 1
express stream classes comprising of 40 students each (total
160 students), over a period of 8 months.
Stage 1: Conduct UNSW non-domain pre-test and domain
pre-test before DINE is taught to students.
Stage 2: Students were taught directly and explicitly the
use of DINE prior to focal lessons in the following for-
mat: Describe--What do you observe? Interpret--What
does your observation mean? Evaluate--How is your
observation related to theory/scientific concepts? Guiding
slides on DINE and examples can be found in Online
Appendix A.
Stage 3: Conduct of Focal Lesson 1 (Online Appendix C).
Stage 4: Conduct of Focal Lesson 2 (Online Appendix D).
Stage 5: Conduct UNSW non-domain post-test and
domain post-test after the implementation of DINE and
focal lessons.
The activities of Stages 3 and 4 are described in detail in
the remaining parts of this chapter.

Stage 3: Focal Lesson 1
In the selected laboratory experiment on diffusion and osmo-
sis (Online Appendix C), students were tasked to carry out
the experiment and obtain their own tabular data through the
practical session. Via Google document, students worked in
groups of four and used DINE to answer the two questions
posed in the practical session.
Step 1: Students participated in the practical session and
collected the tabular data on their own (Figure 5). Practical
skills and laboratory safety were taught prior to this focal
lesson.
Step 2: After completing the practical and clearing up the
laboratory benches, students worked collaboratively in
groups of four and used DINE to answer the two ques-
tions at the end of the practical exercise: Explain what
happens to the potato strip when placed in distilled water?
And explain what happens to the potato strip when placed
in 20% sucrose solution? They answered the questions in
a Google document that was created and shared among
classmates. The Google document allowed students to
collaborate and share answers with a view to help each
other develop a better understanding of construction of
scientific explanation.
Step 3: Each student was allocated one part of explanation
done by another group to critique; that is, Student A cri-
tiqued on the "Describe" statement done by Group 1,
Student B in turn would critique on the "Interpret" state-
ment done by Group 1. Some students were observed to
have gone on to critique the entire explanation (D, IN, E
parts) done by a group (Online Appendix E).
Step 4: Teacher does a general feedback for the class.
Stage 4: Focal Lesson 2
The second focal lesson was carried out in two separate les-
son periods--exploration of school eco-garden and generat-
ing inquiry questions (Part 1) and using DINE strategy to
construct scientific explanations to the students' inquiry
questions (Part 2; Online Appendix D).
Step 1: In Focal Lesson 2 Part 1, students worked in
groups of four. They were brought down to the school
eco-garden to observe the biodiversity there and came up
with their own inquiry questions and hypotheses using the
worksheet provided. In groups, they designed a simple
experiment to test out their hypotheses and included the
type of data they were collecting. At the end of the Focal
Lesson 2 Part 1, the teacher collected the worksheets.
Step 2: The teacher looked at each experiment and hypoth-
esis selected by each group and came up with fictitious
data in tabular form for the groups to analyze. The ficti-
tious data were customized to the hypotheses and experi-
ments of each group (Figure 6). This fictitious data
generation was performed between Parts 1 and 2 of Focal
Lesson 2.
Step 3: In Focal Lesson 2 Part 2, the teacher returned to
the classroom with fictitious data generated for each
group. Using the guided worksheet (Online Appendix D),
students worked in their own groups and used DINE
instructional strategy to construct scientific explanations
for their hypotheses. During the session, each group had
to use the data provided to Describe, "What are the high-
est and lowest readings?" Interpret, "What do these read-
ings signify? Is the trend of the data increasing, decreasing,
or constant and what does it mean?" and Evaluate--"Give
a conclusion to your hypothesis, stating whether it was
possibly true or possibly false, and why." The teacher col-
lected the worksheets and assessed students' ability to
construct scientific explanations.
Data Collection and Interpretation
Quantitative Analysis of Domain Pre-Test and
Post-Test
We conducted a paired-sample t test to understand if there is
a significant improvement in students structuring scientific
explanations using DINE, in assessment tests that require
domain knowledge.
The null hypothesis (H
0
) is that DINE instructional strat-
egy has no impact in improving students' understanding and

construction of scientific explanations in content-based sci-
entific concepts. With regard to the test results listed in
Figure 7, the p value obtained for a one-tail t test is .027 (p <
.05), and the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, we
can conclude that DINE has a significant impact on students'
ability to construct scientific explanations if scaffolding
occurs within their ZPD.
Comparing the individual classes in Figure 8 using a
paired-sample t test as above (null hypothesis [H
0
] is that
DINE has no impact in improving students' construction of
scientific explanations), the p values obtained and respective
implications are collated in Figure 9.
A possible explanation to qualitatively explain why DINE
may not have a positive impact on Class S will be the English
language ability of the class. A comparison of the English
language examination scores in the same time frame of this
project showed that Class S had the lowest mean score
among all four classes. The command of the English lan-
guage may have an important role to play in helping students
understand what Describe, Interpret, and Evaluate entail and
the science concepts taught during the period. This would be
in line with Jacob, Alexander, and Shola (2013) who found
that there was a correlation between proficiency in English
language and academic performance of students in science
and technical education.
However, as depicted in Figure 8, Class P that performed
the best in the domain pre-test among the four express classes
obtained a slightly lower overall mean for the domain post-
test. Our act of "intentional reduction of complexity of
experimental based questions" may have caused some
students to lose their interest during the focal lessons. This
offers the explanation on why the null hypothesis for Class P
is not rejected.
Therefore, the results in Figure 9 explicate two important
facts: The weaker Class S needs pre-knowledge teaching,
and the stronger Class P needs a more complex ZPD.
Besides, the positive results offered by Figures 7 and 9
explicate the fact that we need to apply three aspects collec-
tively for our scaffolding strategy.
Quantitative Analysis of UNSW DINE Pre-Test
and Post-Test
One mark was allocated per correct answer, with a maximum
scoring of 10 marks. We conducted a paired-sample t test to
examine whether there is a significant improvement in the
mean marks of post-test compared with the mean marks of
pre-test of all the four classes (Figure 10).
Only for Class Q, the absolute value of the t stat was
smaller than the t critical two-tail and the probability that the
null hypothesis is true is smaller than alpha (p = .0012). For
Classes P, R, and S, there was no significant statistical differ-
ence between the mean pre-test and post-test scores.
The adapted UNSW pre-test and post-test assesses stu-
dents'ability to analyze data-based questions without a com-
mon understanding of the assessed scientific concepts and

domain knowledge (usually taught by the teacher). With
these findings, we realized that equipping students with just
DINE approach alone is not sufficient for students to learn
science; instead, it reinforces that learning science occurs in
context, and students need to have a connected epistemologi-
cal and ontological domain that functions in tandem with the
logic dimension. These results also provide the grounding
for the need of shared epistemologies and ontologies that can
be achieved through proper argumentation when learning in
groups.
Qualitative Feedback of Student Survey
Using an online survey platform, we created a survey for the
students after the implementation of DINE instructional
strategy to gather feedback on the usefulness of the strategy.
The following questions were asked:
Question 1: Do you find the DINE method (Describe,
INterpret, Evaluate) taught to you earlier to answer struc-
tured or essay questions effective?
--Yes
--No
Question 2: What can be improved on for DINE?
For Question 1, on the effectiveness of DINE instruc-
tional strategy in constructing scientific explanations for
data-based questions, the results are shown in the graph
below (Figure 11). In all, 85% majority of students do see the
need for a structured approach to help train skills for con-
struction of scientific explanations.
For Question 2 on the possible improvements for the
DINE action strategy, the students' comments are collated
and listed in Figure 12 below.
Comparative Observations of Students' Products
in Focal Lessons 1 and 2
Focal Lessons 1 and 2 were two different approaches that
allowed students to use DINE to construct their scientific
explanations. Both lessons enabled students to work collab-
oratively in groups where spaces were provided for argumen-
tation. The approach for Focal Lesson 1 focused more on
students'ability to construct scientific explanations to explain
their data coherence to or divergence from the accepted scien-
tific theory of osmosis that was taught prior in lessons. The
approach for Focal Lesson 2 enabled students in groups to
formulate their own scientific explanations and theories based
on the given data. Focal Lesson 1 also allowed for both indi-
vidual and shared expressions of their understanding in con-
structing scientific explanations; Focal Lesson 2 allowed for
a shared expression of their understanding.
Focal Lesson 1. In Focal Lesson 1, where groups collaborate
in discussing explanations of data divergence to accepted
theory (osmosis) using DINE, their answers showed a more
complete analysis of data as seen in (a), as compared with
answers in (e) and (f) discussed below.
a. "The potato strip increased in length. The water mole-
cules had moved from the water which has higher water
potential to the potato which has lower water potential of
water molecules through osmosis through the partially
permeable membrane." (Online Appendix E)
It was also noticed that when students were given the
ownership to critique the work of their peers, it seems that
individually, they were better at pointing out the missing
gaps.
b. " . . . although all three statements are correct, the
whole explanation does not make sense. In the `E' col-
umn, how did the process of osmosis cause the potato
strip to increase in length? The group only provided the
definition of osmosis and even the explanation is incom-
plete (what does the water molecules pass through?).
They also did not explain how the process relates to the
potato strip's increase in length." (Online Appendix E)
In the above comment (b) from a student on a group's
answer, he or she accurately pinpoints the mistakes that stu-
dents have been making over the years--they are able to
reproduce theoretical knowledge, but unable to link that
domain knowledge to the context in the question given.
c. "You should be more specific and state it as `potato
strip' instead of potato as there's a difference between a
whole potato and just a strip." (Online Appendix E)
d. "The definition is incomplete, they should have men-
tioned "osmosis" in their answer as it is a key word . . . "
(Online Appendix E)
In the critiques (c) and (d) above, individual students echo
the common mantra of teachers for students to be more spe-
cific in writing their scientific explanations--students tend
to be careless with keywords and use of scientific terms in
their daily work.
Focal Lesson 2. In Focal Lesson 2 where there is no evident or
shared understanding of a scientific theory to evaluate coher-
ence to, or divergence of theory from, data, it was observed that
students were more general in their scientific explanations.

e. "The readings signify that the water quality is bad . . . If
there are dead fishes in the water, it means that the water
quality is not good. Our hypothesis is possibly false. As
stated in the reading that when the pH level is high, there
are dead fishes, when the pH level is low, there are lesser
dead fishes." (Online Appendix F)
f. "The readings signify that the plant grow taller with
support than without support. The trend of the data is
increasing. The support enable the plant to grow taller.
Thus, enables the plant to get more sunlight and make
food. So the plant will grow healthily. Our hypothesis is
true. The plant without support grew slower than the plant
with support even though they were given the same
amount of time." (Online Appendix F)
In Example (e), the students used vague words, "bad"
and "not good," to describe the water quality when data on
pH were provided. It implies that not only are the students
unclear about how pH can affect water quality for fish
survival, it also shows that they do not comprehend the
scientific measurement of pH. Their conclusions implied
that as the pH level increases, the number of dead fish
increases although the readings given ranged between pH
= 2 and pH = 3.
In Example (f), the students were able to describe that
"the support enable the plant to grow taller" and added the
consequence of how height "enables the plant to get more
sunlight and make food." The consequence did not explain
how the support enabled the plant to grow taller. These
examples fully support the importance of role of domain
knowledge in applying scaffolding strategies as substanti-
ated by Vygotsky (1978). Without sufficient domain knowl-
edge, the scaffolding is not within their ZPD; hence, it is
not effective, and it does not help to extend their potential
of constructing proper scientific explanations. The differ-
ence between Focal Lessons 1 and 2 is that domain knowl-
edge is shared by the teacher in Focal Lesson 1 but common
domain knowledge has to undergo group processes of argu-
mentation in Focal Lesson 2 before there is a shared
understanding.
In Focal Lesson 1, where data were interpreted based
on divergence from theory, students were taught the pre-
requisite theoretical knowledge of osmosis prior, and their
argumentation in groups was based on a similar shared
understanding among students. This could possibly have led
to more constructive argumentation and refinement of their
construction of scientific explanations. In Focal Lesson 2,
where students had more space to develop their own theories
and consequently scientific explanations, we observed that
there was more variation in quality of responses to construc-
tion of explanations. This could be due to the lack of a strong
shared epistemology of theoretical knowledge among the
group members due to weak argumentation skills in group
work. Because of the lack of a common theoretical under-
standing, students have to rely more on the argumentation
process that occurs in collaborative group work to create a
shared understanding to construct better scientific explana-
tions for their theories.
These observations have led to an expanded understand-
ing of the use of the connective approach in constructing
scientific explanations. From the quantitative analysis of
domain scores and UNSW non-domain test scores and the
qualitative feedback of the student survey, it is evident that
the collective use of epistemology, ontology, and logic is
necessary in developing scientific explanations in students.
However, the observations of the group processes in con-
structing shared understandings of scientific explanations
may point to an expanded understanding of the connective
approach, where learning occurs both in context and in cre-
ating shared understandings in groups.
Expanded Understandings of the
Connective Approach
Because learning occurs in context and within communities
of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991), it is necessary to look
at the connective approach in social learning environments.
The individual cognitive aspects of the connective approach
have expanded meanings when studied in the perspective of
learning in social classroom settings where knowledge is
Positive Areas for improvement
·
· Nothing; it is good enough
·
· Outdoor experiments makes questions related/requires the
DINE method makes it more easy and fun to do.
·
· DINE has already covered all the question needed for
explanation question as long as we follow the DINE
approach there shouldn't be any other things to add on hence
i think the DINE approach is good enough.
·
· Teachers can explain the way of answering questions using this method
better as students may not know when and how to use this method when a
question is given to them to answer. They can also give some examples of
students answering the questions correctly using the DINE method.
·
· For example the IN in DINE, the meaning is to INterpret. It is not really
clear what to interpret when you already describe your answer.
·
· Use it more often for most questions and also expand its use to elaborate
answers longer.
·
· The DINE method can be improved by adding on extra information about
the method and tips on how to answer the questions with better answers
when using the DINE method.

socially constructed. Ontology has expanded meanings in
"realist ontology" where scientific knowledge is socially
constructed but restricted by ontology of natural phenom-
ena (as cited in Driver, Asoko, Leach, Scott, & Mortimer,
1994, p. 6); individual epistemology can be re-conceptual-
ized as epistemology as a social practice (Kelly, McDonald,
& Wickman, 2012) where sociocultural norms can affect
one's conceptions; individual logic can be viewed as shared
logic formation through argumentation that can be affected
by persuasive goals and ethnographic norms (Bricker &
Bell, 2008). Building on to Hewson and Hewson's (1984)
work that focused on the cognition aspects of conceptual
change, Pintrich, Marx, and Boyle (1993) pointed out the
motivational constructs of the learner that can affect the
state of conceptual change. This perspective takes into
account the idea that teachers teach learners with complex
goals, values, and beliefs, not just the logical subject mat-
ter. Factoring the inclusion of both individual motivational
and social constructs that are present in learning based on
current understandings, Figure 13 aims to represent how
the connective approach looks like in social constructivist
classrooms.
Ontology
Driver et al. (1994) contend that it is important to realize that
scientific knowledge is "both symbolic in nature and also
socially negotiated" (p. 5). What we know are constructs of
phenomena of nature that are interpreted and accepted by the
scientific community (Driver et al., 1994). Yet, a view that
scientific knowledge is socially constructed does not equate
to relativism. Harre (as cited in Driver et al., 1994, p. 6) pro-
posed a realist ontology, where scientific knowledge though
socially negotiated, is still constrained by natural phenomena
in the world and the empirical data that scientists gather from
it. Pickering (as cited in Lehrer, Schauble, & Lucas, 2008)
describes science as a process that "forms a dialectic of
resistance (by nature) and accommodation (by humans)"
and the "outcome of this dialectic cannot be determined a
priori" (p. 515). Driver et al. (1994) continue to argue that
learning science is more than just extension of an individu-
al's knowledge about natural phenomena, more than chal-
lenging prior conceptions through discrepant events, more
than a reorganization of "commonsense reasoning" (p. 8);
learning science had to involve learners in ways of thinking
and explaining the world by becoming socialized into the
ways of the scientific community.
Epistemology
From a psychological perspective, an individual can have
more than one epistemology; for instance, formal and prac-
tical epistemologies (Sandoval, 2005), personal epistemol-
ogy, and epistemology as social practice (Kelly et al., 2012).
The study of students' epistemology helps us comprehend
the origins, scope, nature, and limitations of their under-
standings of scientific knowledge. Epistemology as social
practice sees "epistemology as constituted through situated
interaction" (Kelly et al., 2012, p. 285). Social practices in
classrooms like ethnography and sociocultural norms can
affect how learners participate in learning and meaning-
making. In this view of sociocultural epistemology, "knowl-
edge is seen as a competent action in a situation rather than
as correct, static representations of the world" (Kelly et al.,
2012, p. 286). Knowledge is continually generated and
enacted upon rather than being absorbed. Through discourse
and interactions in classrooms, a teacher or a more knowl-
edgeable other can influence the conversations to what is
valued as knowledge.
Logic
One of the science practices central to the study of science is
engagement with argument from evidence. Formal logic
ignores the power of scientific persuasion; social construc-
tion of scientific facts through history, anthropology, and
sociology (Latour & Woolgar, 1979); the cultural milieu of
the scientific community; and effects of ethnography and
cognitive psychology in the formation of arguments (Bricker
& Bell, 2008). Conceptualizations of argumentation show
the gradual shift of viewing logic formation internally in the
minds of individuals, to shared logic formation expressed
externally that takes social and cultural factors into account
and is developed together in communities. For instance,
argumentation theory focuses on the persuasive goal of argu-
ments. Here, argumentation is "social" (as cited in Bricker
& Bell, 2008, p. 477) and "rational" (Bricker & Bell, 2008,
p. 477) because it involves two or more people often aimed

classrooms.

at defending their personal standpoints until it becomes
acceptable to one another. "Reasonableness" (as cited in
Bricker & Bell, 2008) is dependent on context and can be
judged by "target audiences" or "criteria specific to specific
groups" (p. 478) like scientists. Argumentation can appear in
various forms like verbal, written, and visual argumentation
(Bricker & Bell, 2008).
Summary and Future Directions
At the end of this research study, it became apparent that
there are three factors that must converge to affect the devel-
opment of an individual student's ability to construct scien-
tific explanations and consequently, better understanding of
scientific concepts. They are as follows:
1. DINE instructional strategy (Logic)
2. Domain knowledge through bite-size classroom
teaching (Epistemology)
3. Focal lessons within ZPD (Ontology)
Statistical results through the measurement of domain
pre-test and domain post-test scores have shown a significant
improvement in student performance in two out of four
classes. This means that to develop a successful scaffolding
strategy for answering experimental-based questions, we
need a collective approach of "DINE," "Bite-size Learning,"
and "Focal Lesson" via the connective approach. From our
student survey feedback, most of the students have found the
DINE instructional strategy helpful in the construction of
scientific explanation.
The observations of student products derived from the
different approaches in Focal Lessons 1 and 2 also suggested
that the connective approach can be and should be applied to
learning within social contexts. They are as follows:
1. Argumentation (Logic)
2. Epistemology as a social practice (Epistemology)
3. Realist/personal ontologies (Ontology)
The ontology, epistemology, and logic of students' think-
ing and learning of science in social contexts should be
understood together because of the relatedness to each
domain. The understanding of personal ontologies relies on
an understanding of students' epistemologies; the logic of
scientific argumentation in classroom relies on an under-
standing of students' epistemologies; different epistemolo-
giescanelicitdifferentreasonsthatwillmodifyanontological
view (Gupta, Hammer, & Redish, 2010). An understanding
of epistemologies alone is incomplete to guide science teach-
ers in developing "reality" within natural phenomena, con-
ceptual changes, and scientific argumentation in classrooms.
These three domains each have expanded views that include
ideas of socially constructed knowledge that is consistent
with current science education understandings of learning in
classrooms.
The interplay of the three domains of connective approach
in socially negotiated spaces can also be observed in scien-
tific modeling practices (Passmore & Svoboda, 2012) and
other science pedagogies like project-based science instruc-
tion. The role of teacher in social constructivist classrooms
is important. The teacher not only facilitates students' co-
construction of shared knowledge, but he or she also needs to
have a well-structured classroom environment that provides
space for development of the three domains. These include
taking into account group dynamics for argumentation, scaf-
folding structures to elicit epistemic aims of models, and
experiential learning experiences. Structures in managing
group dynamics need to be in place to engage the silent
learner, provide room for individual accountability (Barron
et al., 1998), and prevent a marginalization of the alternative,
to have full participation and co-construction of knowledge
while satisfying all three domains in each student.Assessment
of learning is needed to provide feedback to students on epis-
temic, ontological, and logic dimensions for development
(Duschl, 2008). The conclusions from this research study
have benefited our teachers in understanding how students
learn via the dimensions of the connective approach and will
allow us to direct our future studies on learning science in
social constructivist classrooms.
