Abstract
Background: Limited knowledge on the prevalence and distribution of risk factors impairs the planning and
implementation of cardiovascular prevention programs in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region.
Methods and Findings: Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abnormal lipoprotein levels, obesity, and smoking
were estimated from individual-level patient data pooled from population-based surveys (1998­2007, n = 31,009) from eight
LAC countries and from a national survey of the United States (US) population (1999­2004) Age and gender specific
prevalence were estimated and age-gender adjusted comparisons between both populations were conducted. Prevalence
of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in LAC were 5% (95% confidence
interval [95% CI]: 3.4, 7.9), 20.2% (95% CI: 12.5, 31), and 53.3% (95% CI: 47, 63.4), respectively. Compared to LAC region's
average, the prevalence of each risk factor tended to be lower in Peru and higher in Chile. LAC women had higher
prevalence of obesity and low HDL-cholesterol than men. Obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were
more prevalent in the US population than in LAC population (31 vs. 16.1%, 16.8 vs. 8.9%, and 36.2 vs. 26.5%, respectively).
However, the prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was higher in LAC than in the US (53.3 vs. 33.7%).
Conclusions: Major cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in LAC region, in particular low HDL-cholesterol. In
addition, marked differences do exist in this prevalence profile between LAC and the US. The observed patterns of obesity-
related risk factors and their current and future impact on the burden of cardiovascular diseases remain to be explained.

Introduction
For the last two decades cardiovascular diseases have been the
main cause of death in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
[1] Cardiovascular mortality rates continue to increase in most
LAC countries, and in those countries where rates have declined
the blunting of the trend has been considerably lower than in the
United Sates (US). [2].
Data on the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in LAC
region are limited, and the few studies available show significant
variation in the levels of prevalence. For instance, the CARMELA
study, [3] conducted in seven major urban cities from LAC,
reported markedly different hypertension levels. For instance,
hypertension prevalence in Santiago (Chile), Buenos Aires
(Argentina), and Barquisimeto (Venezuela), ranged from 24% to
29%, whereas in Quito (Ecuador), Bogota
´ (Colombia), Mexico
City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru) varied from 9% to 13%. Yet,
diabetes prevalence in these cities was similar to world's estimates,
around 7%. [3] Differences in rural-urban residence, socioeco-
nomic development, and internal migration patterns could partly
explain the contrasting profiles of cardiovascular risk factors, but
knowledge on this regard is also very limited. This scarcity of data
on the distribution of risk factors and, in turn, on their impact on
incidence and mortality hampers efforts to curtail the growing
epidemic of cardiovascular disease in LAC. In fact, national and
regional health policies have been customarily based on estimates
of the burden of risk factors and disease that rely heavily on
demographic profiles. [4].
Here we report the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors
using data from population-based studies from eight LAC
countries. We also compare the distribution of cardiovascular risk
factors in LAC and the US, as a way to illustrate the current stage
of LAC in the process of the epidemiological transition. Insight
into the specific differences in the distribution of risk factors in the
LAC and US populations is important to foresee future trends in
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the region.
Methods
We analyzed data from the Latin American Consortium of
Studies in Obesity (LASO), [5] and from the US National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004. [6] In total, LAC data from eight
studies based on multi-stage random sampling and three studies
based on single-stage random sampling were pooled. Only
individuals $20 years old and non-pregnant women were
included in our study.
Details on the LASO aims, methods and measurements have
been previously published. [5,7] Briefly, population's size from the
eight LAC countries included were as follow: Argentina (urban
sample, n = 1076), Chile (national sample, n = 3461), Colombia
(two studies, both urban samples, n = 4817), Costa Rica (national
sample, n = 2826), Dominican Republic (national sample,
n = 6117), Peru (three studies: national sample, n = 4201; urban/
rural samples, n = 2868), Puerto Rico (urban sample, n = 865), and
Venezuela (state sample, n = 4778). Details of each individual
study, including year of study, location, sample, age ranges and sex
distribution are available elsewhere [5]. Institutional Review
Boards (IRB) in each country approved the individual studies
and LASO was approved by IRB of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison. All participants provided their informed consent.
Standing height and weight were measured with the participants
wearing light clothing and no shoes. Waist circumference (WC)
was measured at the umbilical level in three studies, [8,9,10] at the
midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest in four studies,
[11,12,13,14] at the high point of the iliac crest in one study, [15]
and was not measured in another. [16] Hip circumference was
only measured in six studies, at the maximum extension of the
buttocks. [8,9,10,11,14,15] Blood pressure measurements were
conducted at least twice in all but one study [12] following
standard recommendations. [17] Blood samples were obtained
after $8 hours of fast and serum glucose, total cholesterol, and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured enzymatically
by automated methods.
In NHANES, WC circumference was measured at the high
point of the iliac crest and hip circumference was measured at the
maximum extension of the buttocks. Three to four blood pressure
measurements were taken following standard procedures [18,19]
and fasting blood glucose and lipids were also measured by
automated methods. [20,21].
Following standard practice, hypertension was defined as
systolic blood pressure (SBP) $140 mm Hg, diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) $90 mm Hg or self-reported current antihyper-
tensive treatment. [22,23] Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting
blood glucose $7.0 mmol/L ($126 mg/dL) [24] or self-reported
current pharmacological treatment for diabetes, i.e. insulin, oral
hypoglycemic agents or both. High total cholesterol was defined as
a serum total cholesterol level $6.15 mmol/L ($240 mg/dL).
High LDL-cholesterol was defined as $4.10 mmol/L ($160 mg/
dL), and low HDL-cholesterol as ,1.03 mmol/L (,40 mg/dL) in
men and ,1.28 mmol/L (,50 mg/dL) in women. Hypertriglyc-
eridemia was defined as a serum triglyceride level $1.69 mmol/L
($150 mg/dL). [25] Current cigarette smokers were those who
had smoked $100 cigarettes over their lifetime and smoked at the
time of the interview in NHANES and two LASO studies, and
those who smoke at least one cigarette per day at the time of
interview in the remaining LASO studies. [11,14] Overall obesity
was defined as a body mass index (BMI) $30 kg/m2 and
abdominal obesity as WC $88 cm in women and $102 cm in
men. [26] In addition, we used alternative definitions for overall
obesity (BMI $27 kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (WC $94 cm in
women and WC $91 cm in men) based on cut-offs previously
derived by our group for the LAC population. [7].
We used multivariate-chained equations to impute missing data
and minimize selection bias due to the exclusion of participants
with incomplete data in LASO (see Supplementary Materials S1).
[27,28] The imputation model was stratified by gender and
included post-stratification weights, sociodemographic variables,
anthropometric indicators, cardiovascular risk factors, and medical
history of cardiovascular events. Ten complete datasets were
generated and the parameters of interest were averaged across the
imputed datasets using Rubin's formula. [29].
We used post-stratification by age and gender distribution of the
whole population of LAC countries included in the analysis as a

way to lessen potential bias due to non-response and sampling
frame under-coverage. [30] Post-stratification weights were
constructed using the gender-by-age (10-year groups) distribution
of the year 2000 population totals in each country. Individuals in
the 70­79 and $80 years old strata were grouped together due to
the reduced number of observations. Population size data were
taken from the US Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov) for
Puerto Rico and from the Centro Latinoamericano y Cariben
~o de
Demografi
´a - CELADE (http://www.cepal.org.ar/Celade) for all
other countries.
We used multiple weighted linear and log-binomial regressions,
clustering by country, to estimate the average level and the
prevalence of each risk factor, as well as age and gender mean
differences and prevalence ratios (PR). We used censored normal
regression to estimate average blood pressure, as a way to correct
for the bias that would have resulted from lower blood pressure
levels among individuals receiving antihypertensive treatment (9%
of the whole population). [31] We also explored potential age-
dependent gender differences in the distribution of risk factors and
adjusted for study to account for potential differences in study
design and methods. Finally, we estimated age- and gender-
adjusted PRs for each risk factor to compare each country to the
whole LAC region.
The average level and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk
factors in the US population were estimated in NHANES
participants who attended to the mobile examination. We used
the medical examination sampling weights to account for
differential non-response and sampling frame under-coverage,
and to adjust for over-sampling of some sociodemographic groups.
[6] In order to compare the prevalence of risk factors in LAC and
the US, we standardized the estimates from LASO and NHANES
by the direct method to the age and gender distribution (20­29 to
$70 years) of the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the
US at the midpoint between 1999 and 2000. PRs were calculated
from the standardized estimates and CIs were estimated using
simulation. [32] Stata/MP 11 (Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas, US) was used for all analyses.
Results
Our study included 31,009 individuals from LASO (mean age
39.9 years; age range 20­109; 95% CI: 38.2, 41.6; 49% men) and
13,441 individuals from NHANES (mean age 46.5 years; age
range 20­85; 95% CI: 45.9, 47.1; 48.8% men).
Distribution of Major Cardiovascular Risk Factors in LAC
Blood pressure. Mean SBP was 123.7 mm Hg (95% CI:
117.1, 130.3) in men and 119.0 mm Hg (95% CI: 113.6, 124.3) in
women (p = 0.003). SBP increased with age in both men and
women, but the rise was steeper among women (p-value for
gender-by-age interaction: 0.003; Figure 1). As a result, before age
60, age-adjusted SBP was 5.6 mm Hg higher in men than in
women (95% CI: 2.1, 9.0), whereas in participants $60 years men
tended to have lower SBP than women (mean difference:
23.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: 27.6, 0.3).
Average DBP in men (76.9 mm Hg; 95% CI: 73.8, 80.0) was
higher than in women (73.4; 95% CI: 70.5, 76.2; p = 0.005). DBP
increased with age in both men and women, and was higher
among men at all ages (Figure 1). However, the mean difference in
DBP in men and women decreased with age, being 3.7 mm Hg
(95% CI: 1.4, 6.0) in participants ,60 years old and 0.2 (95% CI:
21.2, 1.7) in those $60 years old (p-value for gender-by-age
interaction: 0.005).
The average prevalence of hypertension was 20.2% (95% CI:
12.5, 31.0), but varied considerably with age: from 5% in 20­29
years old to 70.9% in $70 years old (Figure 2). Overall, men were
slightly more likely to be hypertensive than women (21.1% vs.
19.4%; Table 1). However, this gender disparity was considerable
stronger among younger individuals. In fact, the PR was 1.68
(95% CI: 1.06, 2.65) in 20­29 years old but only 1.06 (95% CI:
0.98, 1.15) in those $70 years old (p-value for gender-by-age
interaction = 0.027).
Blood glucose. Mean fasting blood glucose was slightly but
consistently higher in men (5.2 mmol/L; 95% CI: 4.8, 5.5) than in
women (5.1 mmol/L; 95% CI: 4.8, 5.4; p = 0.052) across all age
groups. The average prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 5% (95%
CI: 3.4, 7.9; Table 1), but increased from 0.9% in 20­29 years old
participants to 16.4% in those $70 years old. Across all age
groups, men were slightly more likely to be diabetic than women,

but not significantly so (age-adjusted PR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.32;
Figure 2).
Serum lipoproteins. Mean total, HDL- and LDL-cholester-
ol were 4.73 (95% CI: 4.49, 4.96), 1.14 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.19), and
2.85 mmol/L (95% CI: 2.59, 3.11), respectively. Total cholesterol
and both HDL- and LDL- fractions increased with age. After
adjustment by age, total cholesterol was similar in men and
women ,50 years old. However, among participants $50 years,
older women had significantly higher total cholesterol than men
(mean difference: 0.25 mmol/L, p = 0.042). Likewise, LDL-
cholesterol was higher in women than in men but only among
individuals $70 years old (mean difference: 0.20 mmol/L,
p = 0.020). In contrast, HDL-cholesterol was consistently higher
in women than in men across all age groups (mean difference:
0.07 mmol/L, p = 0.016). On the other hand, average triglyceride
levels were 1.70 mmol/L (95% CI: 1.53, 1.88) in men and
1.49 mmol/L (95% CI: 1.40, 1.58) in women (p = 0.028). This
difference persisted after adjustment for age (mean difference:
0.22 mmol/L, p = 0.023).
The prevalence of high total cholesterol was about 9% (Table 1)
and increased with age (Figure 2). High total cholesterol tended to
be higher among young men and among older women than in
corresponding groups of the opposite sex. PRs of elevated total
cholesterol in men compared to women were 1.22 (95% CI: 0.97,
1.54), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.33), 1.02 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.16), 0.93
(95% CI: 0.86, 1.06), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.01) and 0.78 (95% CI:
0.62, 0.97) in participants 20­29, 30­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­69,
and $70 years old, respectively (p-value for gender-by-age
interaction = 0.030). A similar pattern was observed for high
LDL-cholesterol. Over one half of the population had low HDL-
cholesterol (Table 1), but the prevalence was considerably and
consistently lower in men (32.8%) than in women (76.9%), across
all age groups (PR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.75; Figure 2). About a
quarter of the population had hypertriglyceridemia (Table 1). Men
had higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly at
younger ages (p-value for gender-by-age interaction = 0.004). PRs
for hypertriglyceridemia in men compared to women were 1.85
(95% CI: 1.36, 2.53) in participants 20­29 years old, 1.66 (95%
CI: 1.28, 2.17) in 30­39 years old, 1.49 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.85) in 40­
49 years old, 1.34 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.59) in 50­59 years old, 1.20
(95% CI: 1.05, 1.37) in 60­69 years old, and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.97,
1.20) in $70 years old.
Smoking. One out of four members of the LAC population
were current smokers (Table 1). Smoking was considerably more
prevalent in men than in women (32.2% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.006)
regardless of age (p-value for gender-by-age interaction = 0.627;
Figure 2). After adjustment for age, men were 1.59 times more
likely to be current smokers than women (95% CI: 1.13, 2.23).
Smoking prevalence decreased from 28.2% in 20­29 years old to
9.9% in $70 years old (Figure 2). Compared to 20­29 years old
individuals, the gender-adjusted PRs for smoking were 0.95 (95%
CI: 0.81, 1.11) in participants 30­39 years old, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.76,
1.22) in 40­49 years old, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.11) in 50­59 years
old, 0.49 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.79) in 60­69 years old, and 0.33 (95%
CI: 0.17, 0.65) in $70 years old.
Overall and abdominal obesity. Mean BMI was 26.2 kg/
m2 (95% CI: 25.1, 27.3) in men and 26.7 kg/m2 (95% CI: 25.9,
27.5) in women (p = 0.046). BMI increased with age, reaching
maximum values at 50­59 years in both men (26.7 kg/m2) and
women (28.0 kg/m2). BMI differences between women and men
increased significantly with age from 0.6 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.2, 1.1)
in participants 50­59 years old to 1.4 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.9, 1.9) in
those $70 years old (p-value for gender-by-age interac-
tion = 0.001). Correspondingly, the prevalence of overall obesity
(BMI $30 kg/m2) was higher in women than in men: 18.4% vs.
13.8% (Table 1). Although the PR of obesity (women/men)
seemed to increase with age (Figure 2) a gender-by-age interaction
was not statistically significant (P = 0.444).
Mean WC was 90.8 cm (95% CI: 86.8, 94.8) in men and
87.2 cm (95% CI: 83.2, 91.2) in women (p = 0.015). After

adjustment by age, the difference between men and women was
3.7 cm (95% CI: 1.2, 6.2), with no significant gender-by-age
interaction (P = 0.273). The prevalence of abdominal obesity as
defined by the World Health Organization (WC $88 cm in
women and $102 cm in men) was more than three times higher in
women than in men (55.5% vs. 15.4%) and the PR did not change
significantly by age (age-adjusted PR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.54, 8.35; p-
value for gender-by-age interaction: 0.158). Gender-adjusted PRs
for abdominal obesity were: 1.31 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.69), 1.58 (95%
CI: 1.12, 2.22), 1.81 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.59), 1.94 (95% CI: 1.45,
2.61), and 1.77 (95% CI: 1.31, 2.39) for participants 30­39, 40­49,
50­59, 60­69, and $70 years old, compared to those 20­29 years
old. When the definition of abdominal obesity was based on the
ethnic and gender specific cut points derived from LASO (WC
$94 cm in women and WC $91 cm in men) [7] the prevalence
was higher in men than in women (37.1% vs. 22.8%) and the PR
did not change significantly by age (age-adjusted PR = 1.67; 95%
CI: 1.35, 2.06).
Comparison between Each Country and the LAC Region
When compared to all the countries included in this analysis,
Argentina showed similar prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol,
and smoking, but significantly lower prevalence of hypertension
(PR = 0.61; Table 2). Chile had significantly higher prevalence of
hypertension (PR = 1.48) and smoking (PR = 1.82). Colombia and
Costa Rica, had significantly higher prevalence of high total
cholesterol (PRs: 1.67 and 1.86), but significantly lower prevalence
of smoking (PRs: 0.65 and 0.76, respectively). In turn, Peru had
significantly lower prevalence of hypertension (PR: 0.65) and
diabetes (PR: 0.41), while Puerto Rico had a significantly higher
prevalence of diabetes (PR: 2.89). In general, the prevalence of
each risk factor tended to be lower in Peru and higher in Chile
compared to the region.
Comparison between the LAC and the US Population
Age-specific levels of SBP were slightly, but consistently higher
in LAC than in US men and women (Figure 3). Interestingly,
while in the US population SBP became higher in women than in
men around age 50, in the LAC population this cross-over
happened around age 60. This seems to be the result of a steeper
age-related increase in SBP among US as compared to LAC
women. DBP was also higher in LAC men and women for all age
groups. However, DBP declined significantly starting at age 40 in
US men and women, while in LAC men DBP flattened after age
50 and continued to increase among LAC women. Nevertheless,
age and gender adjusted prevalence of hypertension was similar in
the US and the LAC populations (Table 3).
Age and gender-specific levels of total cholesterol were
consistently higher in the US population than in the LAC
population (Figure 3). Also, the gender-specific patterns of age-
related changes in total cholesterol were similar in both
populations. Accordingly, the age and gender-adjusted prevalence
of high total cholesterol was about 25% lower in the LAC
population (Table 3).
Regardless of age, HDL cholesterol was higher in men and
women from the US than in men and women from LAC (Figure 3).
HDL cholesterol level was higher in women than in men in both
the US and the LAC populations, but the magnitude of this gender
differences was considerably larger in the US. This was consistent
with an age and gender-adjusted 63% higher prevalence of low
HDL cholesterol in the LAC population (Table 3).
In contrast, age-specific levels of blood glucose were higher in
US men, but lower in US women than in the corresponding LAC
groups. Also, the age and gender-adjusted prevalence of diabetes
was lower, but not significantly so, in the LAC population.
Moreover, US men and women had higher BMI than LAC men
and women, across all age groups (Figure 3). Accordingly, the age
and gender-adjusted prevalence of overall obesity and abdominal
obesity were significantly lower in the LAC population (PR: 0.58
and 0.79, respectively). Finally, the prevalence of smoking was
similar in both populations (Table 3).
Discussion
Our results indicate that the prevalence of major cardiovascular
risk factors in the LAC region is within the range observed in
developed countries, varying from 5% for diabetes to 30% for
overall obesity. [33] We also found that after accounting for
differences in the age distribution, the prevalence of hypertension,
diabetes, and smoking were similar in the LAC and the US
populations. [33] In contrast, the prevalence of obesity and high
total cholesterol were significantly higher in the US, but the
prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was significantly higher in the
LAC population. We also found considerable between-country
heterogeneity within the LAC region. The most striking depar-
tures from regional averages were a higher prevalence of
hypertension and smoking in Chile, a lower prevalence of all risk
factors in Peru, and a very high prevalence of diabetes in Puerto
Rico, as compared to the whole group of countries included in this
analysis.

In general, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the
LAC population was within the range of prevalence observed in
the US. Specifically, gender and age-adjusted prevalence of
hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and smoking were
only 10­20% lower in LAC, while the prevalence of total and high
LDL-cholesterol, and abdominal obesity were 20­40% lower. The
most striking differences between these two populations were a
42% lower prevalence of obesity and a 63% higher prevalence of
low HDL-cholesterol in Latin Americans. An additional important
finding was that despite very similar levels of SBP, LAC men and
women had higher DBP levels than their US counterparts. Such
finding was most evident among participants $50 years old. A
marked age-related decline in DBP was observed in this age group
in participants from the US but not in those from LAC; indeed,
women from LAC demonstrated a continued increase in DBP
after age 50. These findings generalize previous observations from
a Peruvian population [34] to LAC and hint to important
differences in the underlying hemodynamic determinants of blood
pressure between the US and LAC populations. However, due to
the cross-sectional nature of the data, it cannot be excluded that
survival bias was at least partially responsible for these differences.
The cardiovascular implications of a different pattern of age-
related changes in blood pressure in LAC need to be addressed in
longitudinal studies.
The prevalence of hypertension found in our study (20.2%) was
similar to that reported by CARMELA (18%), [3] even though
our study included individuals from non-urban settings. In
contrast, our estimate of the prevalence of hypertension was only
half that from a worldwide study on the burden of hypertension,
that included reports from 1980 to 2002 (44% in men and 40% in
women). [35] The prevalence of diabetes mellitus estimated in our
study (5%) was within the range of that found in CARMELA [3],
as well as that reported by the International Diabetes Federation.
[36].
LAC women, particularly those in older age groups, were found
to have a worst profile than men for several risk factors. This was
most notorious for obesity-related traits such as overall and
abdominal obesity indicators as well as low HDL-cholesterol.
Furthermore, approximately one out of three post-menopausal
women was obese, and prevalence of hypertension and low-HDL
in older women were around 60%.
In age-adjusted analysis, despite the fact that overall and
abdominal obesity were substantially less frequent in LAC than in
the US, the prevalence of obesity-related traits such as hyperten-
sion and diabetes mellitus was similar in both populations, whereas
the prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was much higher in LAC
(53.3% vs. 33.7%). This finding is unlikely explained by differences
in the use of statins, as these drugs have only a minor effect on
HDL-cholesterol. These observations suggest that metabolic
disturbances associated with atherosclerosis arise at lower levels
of adiposity in the LAC as opposed to the US population. Further
investigation is required to ascertain whether genetic, environ-
mental, or behavioural factors account for these differences,
particularly those in HDL-cholesterol levels.
The prevalence of smoking in LAC population was 25.8%
(19.5% in women and 32.2% in men). In both men and women,
higher prevalence were observed in younger age groups, with a
decline seen after age 50. The LAC pattern of smoking clearly
contrasts with that observed in other low- and middle-income
countries such as India, where higher prevalence of smoking is
seen with increasing age. [37] This finding may reflect a birth-
cohort effect, and has important implications, as it points to the
need to develop and maintain anti-smoking campaigns that
particularly target younger age groups in the LAC region.
Recent international reports have noted the limited availability
of good quality surveillance data in most low- and middle-income
settings. [33,38,39] Given that some surveys take longer, or do not
make it to scientific reports, we had the advantage of collaborating
closely with our colleagues from LAC region to expand the

availability of data and provide more precise estimates for the
LAC region. Indeed, about half (4/9) contributing studies to
LASO published their results as local reports or publications in
Spanish. We acknowledge that our findings may not apply to the
whole LAC region, since several LAC countries, with large
populations or with very unique set of prevention policies such as
Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay, were not included in our study.
Nevertheless, ours is the most comprehensive and representative
regional study to date.
A particular strength of our study is the pooling of individual
data from thousands of subjects, obtained from similar studies
based on random samples of the population. Although the LASO
studies did not share the exact same protocol, methods to measure
anthropometric indicators, blood pressure, and blood glucose and
lipids were similar, and should be a minor source of variability,
which was partly accounted for by adjusting for study in all
analyses. [5] By using multiple imputation we likely decreased the
potential for selection bias and the loss of power that would have
resulted from excluding from the analysis those individuals with
missing values in one or more study variables. [28] Moreover, by
post-stratifying by age and gender we were able to obtain
prevalence estimates that are more representative of the whole
population of LAC. Although single country estimates are
desirable, they would have been unstable. Therefore, we gave
preference to obtaining accurate regional estimates that should be
useful in characterizing global health status and defining regional
cardiovascular health policies. This is one of the few studies that
included rural population and, therefore, provides a better picture
of the cardiovascular risk profile in the LAC population. [40].
Although more detailed information is needed, particularly at
the country level, our results provide further insights into the
specific differences in the distribution of risk factors in the LAC
and US populations. They should be useful for monitoring
regional trends, as well as for defining and implementing more
effective preventive strategies in the whole Americas region.
