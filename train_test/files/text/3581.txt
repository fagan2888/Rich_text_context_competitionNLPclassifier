Big Data in food and agriculture
Kelly Bronson1 and Irena Knezevic2
Abstract
Farming is undergoing a digital revolution. Our existing review of current Big Data applications in the agri-food sector has
revealed several collection and analytics tools that may have implications for relationships of power between players in
the food system (e.g. between farmers and large corporations). For example, Who retains ownership of the data
generated by applications like Monsanto Corproation's Weed I.D. ``app''? Are there privacy implications with the data
gathered by John Deere's precision agricultural equipment? Systematically tracing the digital revolution in agriculture, and
charting the affordances as well as the limitations of Big Data applied to food and agriculture, should be a broad research
goal for Big Data scholarship. Such a goal brings data scholarship into conversation with food studies and it allows for a
focus on the material consequences of big data in society.

Farming is undergoing a digital revolution. For example,
even small-scale farmers are gathering information pas-
sively collected by precision agricultural equipment, and
many farmers are using information from large datasets
and precision analytics to make on-farm decisions. John
Deere fits all of its tractors with sensors that stream data
about soil and crop conditions and the corporation
invites farmers to subscribe (and pay) for access to infor-
mation that can help them decide, for example, where to
plant crops. John Deere tractors are proprietary and the
data they collect are not openly accessible to farmers. We
can see from this one example that the use of large infor-
mation sets and the digital tools for collecting, aggregat-
ing and analysing them ­ together referred to as Big Data
­ has the potential to wade in on long-standing relation-
ships between players in food and agriculture (e.g.,
between farmers and agricultural corporations). Despite
a solid body of critical data scholarship, there has been
no attention given to Big Data's implications in the realm
of food and agriculture. In this commentary, we argue
that current understandings of Big Data would benefit
from a focus on their material consequences in food and
agriculture, and we lay out suggestions as to how a line of
inquiry across the fields of data studies and food studies
could facilitate such an improved understanding.
Big Data in agriculture?
Arguably, farming has been empirically driven for over a
century but the data collected was not digital.
Agriculture Canada's family of research centres (circa
1920s) meticulously accounted for wheat yields across
farms and weather patterns in order to increase efficiency
in production. Big Data is different from this historic
information gathering in terms of the volume and the
analytical potential embedded in contemporary digital
technologies. Big Data proponents promise a level of
precision, information storage, processing and analysing
that was previously impossible due to technological limi-
tations (see Datafloq, 2015). Compare a notebook
wherein a farmer might log information about his or
her crop performance with a digital phone `app' used
to predict and direct future production practices.
Logging information using the application can be done
more efficiently (even by voice recognition) and the
volume of information the farmer may access is pro-
found: agricultural management tools provide access to
interacting with datasets that stretch way beyond the
individual farm. Still, the nature of the distinction
between historic farm monitoring and Big Data is an
open research question; systematically tracing the digital
revolution in agriculture and charting the affordances as

well as the limitations of Big Data-driven decisions
should be a broad research goal for Big Data scholarship
in the realm of food and agriculture.
Our existing review of current Big Data applications
in the agri-food sector has revealed several Big Data
collection and analytics tools that may have implica-
tions for relationships of power between players in
the North American food system. Under a platform
called Integrated Field Systems (IFS), Monsanto
Corporation has a suite of digital tools for collecting
and analysing farm data. Farmers are being encouraged
to use Monsanto's IFS tools to collect information
about soil conditions, weed varieties and weather.
This information, they are told, will help them minim-
ize risk and streamline decision-making. IFS raises
questions, however, about the relative benefits of the
collection and use of Big Data in farming. In the case
of Weed I.D., which helps farmers to identify weeds and
map weed pressures in a digital mapping tool, there are
likely also benefits to the corporation, namely, promot-
ing proprietary chemicals and identifying new chemical
needs and therefore areas of possible investment in
research and development. That there are corporate
benefits attached to Big Data in agriculture seems evi-
denced by the recent purchasing habits of Monsanto,
which bought the digital tool developer Climate
Corporation in 2013. Climate Corp. itself is acquiring
`start-ups' (640 Labs and Solum) who are focused on
tools for collecting farm-level information.
The acquisition of these companies by Monsanto
suggests that Big Data has implications not just for
farmers but also for stakeholders throughout the agri-
food system. For instance, food processors are
monitoring social media data in an effort to predict
consumer sentiment and secure social approval or
`license' (Prno and Slocombe, 2012). Sysmos
Corporation has developed an analytics tool called
Heartbeat, which combs social media for patterns rele-
vant to food marketing trends and consumer interests.
The use of social media data to steer corporate priori-
ties is useful for food producers and retailers but it is
potentially problematic, not least because social media
data is necessarily selective (e.g., only 18.5 million rela-
tively young Canadians use Facebook, Oliviera, 2013).
It may be that the implications of Big Data relate
directly to their context of development, namely, for-
profit, non-profit or public. The Agroclimate Impact
Reporter (AIR) is an application built by government,
specifically Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's
National Agricultural Information Services (NAIS).
Climate data from volunteers, farmers and media
reporting is gathered using this tool and then the data
is anonymized and mapped by NAIS, which maps can
then be used by anyone interested in information about
current/historical weather conditions municipally,
regionally or nationally. The tool is explicitly intended
to help producers mitigate weather-related risks but it is
also used to support them when they make claims to the
Canadian Drought Monitoring and Livestock Tax
Deferral program.
Thinking carefully about Big Data in
agriculture: New directions in critical
data studies?
Thinking carefully about the context of the production
and use of Big Data is precisely what critical data studies
scholars do when they highlight Big Data as actively
framed and interpreted by people, in particular social
and technical contexts (Bowker, 2005; Edwards, 2010;
Gitelman and Jackson, 2013; Hacking, 1992; Porter,
1995). `Data [do] not just exist', Lev Manovich explains,
they have to be `generated' (2001: 224). Critical social
scientists have suggested that Big Data cannot be treated
as a technical accomplishment separable from the social,
and in particular from questions of justice and ethics
(Busch, 2014; Couldry and Turow, 2014; Crawford
et al., 2014; Elmer et al., 2015; Kitchin, 2014). Scholars
have, for example, revealed how much `crowd-sourced'
information is primarily benefitting marketers and other
elite interests, rather than the crowd (Qualman, 2009).
Facebook has been accused and legally tried for the
unauthorized collection of user data, from which it is
said to profit handsomely (Matlack, 2012).
The critical data studies framework therefore allows
for the careful examination of the possible ethical impli-
cations that appear to be arising from particular config-
urations and uses of Big Data in the realm of food and
agriculture. Some possible research questions for future
work in this area are as follows: Who retains ownership
of the data generated by applications like Weed I.D.?
Are there privacy implications with the data gathered
by precision agricultural equipment? Who ought to
have access to the data generated by John Deere's pre-
cision agricultural equipment? How are corporate scien-
tists and consultants interfacing with data gathered by
tools like Weed I.D. and are they doing so in service of
profit-generating innovations (like new chemicals)?
Exploring the ethical implications of Big Data in food
and agriculture not only builds on critical data studies
but it also extends food studies scholarship, which has
historically focused on the effects of technologies on
farmers and food systems (Clapp, 2012; Friedmann,
2009; Friedmann and McMichael, 1987; Koc et al.,
2012; McMichael, 2009). Food studies scholarship on
the development of genetically modified seeds, for
instance, has revealed that these technologies further
inequities between farmers and large chemical corpor-
ations, not least because of a legal regime that limits
farmers' access to the technology (Bronson, 2015).
2 Big Data & Society
We predict that particular agricultural systems may
be perpetuated not just in the design and use of Big
Data--say, for the disproportionate gain of powerful
agri-food corporations--but also in the marketing of
Big Data technologies. It is obvious that the imagined
typical user for John Deere's Big Data analytics is a
farmer who unproblematically adopts the newest tech-
nologies. In the promissory images of the Farm
Forward marketing video (see John Deere, 2012), the
farmer is pictured using digital weather apps and living
in a completely automated or `smart' house. The ima-
gery of John Deere's Farm Forward marketing cam-
paign is imbued by a long-standing cultural bias
towards farming that can be `rationally managed' as
technology-maximizing, profit-oriented businesses ­
this is called a `productivist' model for farming
(Kneen, 1995). Food studies scholars have revealed
productivism as a model of over-production of inex-
pensive low-nutrient food that has brought great com-
mercial gain to a handful of agri-food conglomerates,
but for the rest of the world it has resulted in serious
ecological (Moore Lappe, 1971), economic (Lang and
Heasman, 2003; Patel, 2007), health (Albritton, 2009)
and sociocultural consequences (Esteva, 1996; Kneen,
1995), without notably alleviating hunger and malnu-
trition in the long term (De Schutter, 2015, para. 6).
The marketing pitches for Big Data applications ­
along with sensors, meters and other data-generating
tools ­ arguably promise farmers the same thing that
tractors and genetically modified seeds were and still
are promised to do: `make the farm pay' (Kneen,
1995). John Deere is said to be `revolutionizing' farm-
ing with Big Data. One description of their Big Data
tools suggests that they will enable farmers to `enhance
productivity and increase business efficiency' (Datafloq,
2015). Similarly, Monsanto's IFS is described online as
integrating `innovations in seed science, agronomy,
data analysis, precision agriculture equipment and
service to provide farmers with hybrid matches and a
variable rate planting prescription to improve corn
yield opportunity' (Monsanto, 2014). These are not
new promises; rather, they reflect a long-standing pair-
ing between the good life and the effective application
of new technologies to labour (Marx and Roe-Smith,
1994). They arguably also reflect a bias against farming
methods that forgo high technologies by implicitly
painting them parochial, folksy and backward, which
begs for critical reflection on Big Data in agriculture. A
key research question here is: In what ways do the
images circulating in the promotion of Big Data tools
normalize hegemonic farming systems?
While many concerns in the area of Big Data in food
and agriculture may have to do with data ownership
and the furthering of inequity between food system
players, we suspect that the issues are even more
complex. While crowdsourcing Big Data tools rely on
farmers' knowledge, they do not necessarily invite
farmers to shape the context in which that knowledge
is collected. Some possible research questions here are:
Who has a role in deciding on the context for the data
production, storage and use of particular data tools
used in food and agriculture? Who decides which
kinds of data are to be collected, given the functioning
of current big digital collection and analytics tools? Are
there farming systems (like holistic farm management
systems) whose material realities cannot be captured by
applications for collecting quantitative information
(Hacking, 1992; Porter, 1995)?
Now is the time for critical data
scholarship in food and agriculture
Big Data is poised to reproduce long-standing relation-
ships between food system players ­ between farmers
and corporations, or between organic and conventional
farmers ­ and thus it deserves scholarly attention by
both critical data and food studies scholars. Big Data
is an important field of study, for `the era of big data
has begun' (boyd and Crawford, 2012: 662). Now is the
time for scholarly intervention into Big Data because
the consequences of Big Data and its social infrastruc-
ture (laws, mores) are not yet fixed. It is a technology's
interaction with the social ecology that determines its
environmental, social and human consequences (Bijker
et al., 2012; Bronson, 2015; Kranzberg, 1986: 545).
Once in place, the social system surrounding technolo-
gies is notoriously difficult to analyse (Bowker and Star,
1999: 33; Bronson, 2015). As farmers, agricultural cor-
porations and government scientists clamour for access
to large datasets in order to drive their decision-
making, significant questions are emerging about how
these data ought to be understood and managed. Big
Data scholarship ought to add to this understanding by
asking questions about the context of data shaping and
use in agri-food ­ about how datasets are being con-
structed and used, by whom they are being used and for
whose benefit, and the potential limitations or biases of
the datasets under use.
Critically examining Big Data in food and agricul-
ture provides a new site of scholarship for critical data
theorists and one that allows for the probing of the
links between Big Data and the material aspects of
data use. Current enthusiasm for the material effects
of social processes ­ the new materialist turn in social
science ­ has focused less on digital shifts, perhaps
because `things always seem to be disappearing'
(Chun, 2011: 11). In the case of food systems, examin-
ing the material consequences of digital tools for
generating and analysing agricultural information can
raise questions of survival if it turns out that Big Data
Bronson and Knezevic 3
developments are supporting particular agricultural
systems of production, and thus particular farmer live-
lihoods, at the expense of others.
We have raised questions that carry cultural, polit-
ical, ecological and material significance. A deliberate
and sustained dialogue between data scholars and food
scholars on the topic of Big Data in food and agricul-
ture seems a pressing research priority.
