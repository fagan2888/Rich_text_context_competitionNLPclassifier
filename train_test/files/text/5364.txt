The Physical and Psychological Health of
Migrants in Guangzhou, China: How Does
Neighborhood Matter?

Abstract
This study analyzed the health of migrants in 4 types of neighborhood in the city of Guangzhou in China. The research shows
that the health of internal migrants in urban villages and private housing neighborhoods is much better than those living in
older inner city neighborhoods (which are known as jiefang shequ) and unit neighborhoods (which are known as danwei). The
reasons behind this are the facts that the migrants in urban villages tend to be relatively young and there tend to be better
social and economic conditions in the private housing neighborhood. Moreover, among the 4 kinds of neighborhood, the
gap between psychological health and physical health is the largest in urban villages. In addition, migrants who are younger,
have better working conditions, and have higher levels of education have better health scores, and they tend to have more
friends in the city, larger houses, better insurance, and more satisfaction with their neighborhood relationships, and they
tend to be better adapted to urban life. As for the determinants of health, individual characteristics, community factors, and
insurance are the most important factors. Specifically, individual age and age of housing have negative influences on physical
health while insurance has a positive effect. This study shows that the type of neighborhood that migrants live in has a great
impact on their psychological health, which can be improved by promoting neighborhood environments. Last, we propose
that it is necessary to implement different strategies in different communities.

Introduction
Since the implementation in 1978 of the program of eco-
nomic reforms known as the "Reform and Opening Up"
policy, China has experienced massive population mobility
from rural to urban areas. However, after 30 years, the living
conditions of internal migrants in China are often poor.1,2
Subject to urban and rural dual structure, which was formed
during the period of the planned economy, although there is
a large number of migrants moving to cities, most of them
lack basic social protection.3 Most of these migrants live in
urban villages and the run-down older inner city neighbor-
hoods, which lack public facilities.4 Poor living environ-
ments and a lack of government support have a negative
impact on the health of migrants.5,6 Therefore, it is important
to carry out research into the health issues faced by China's
migrants.
Qi et al7 used data from the Chinese Mobility and Health
Survey and found that the health of migrants is better than
the health of the rural population that did not migrate.
However, the authors also found that the health of the
migrants who return home is lower than before, which leads
to the poorer health seen in the rural population compared
with that seen in the urban population. After moving to cit-
ies, migrants tend to face more health risks than the local
population, as they tend to work in jobs that are more diffi-
cult and more dangerous.8 Many migrants from rural areas
are young and healthy, but when they get older or become
ill, they return to the rural areas. Therefore, the health risks
and disease burden is transferred to rural areas, which exac-
erbates the demand for health resources in rural areas.9 In
addition, studies have suggested that the health of migrants

in China is affected by intergenerational effects, ie, migrants
whose parents have poorer health or greater levels of work
pressure are more likely to have poor physical health.10
Therefore, narrowing the expanding gap between the rich
and poor and reducing health inequity is an important task
for modern China.
Regarding the factors that influence health, socioeconomic
status (SES), living and working conditions, and other regional
development disparities are important determinants.11,12
Lynch et al13 found that children's family environments have
a large impact on their health behaviors and psychological
characteristics in adulthood. In addition, Robert and House14
found that there is a significant positive correlation between
liquid assets and the health status of those who are middle-
aged and elderly. Lynch et al15 studied data from 282 metro-
politan areas in the United States and found that the greater
the income gap in each area, the higher mortality rate. Many
individuals with high SES experience health problems
largely in the later stages of life, but those with lower SES
often suffer from a rapid decline in health in middle age.16
With increasing age, the differentiation between the health of
people from different socioeconomic backgrounds becomes
more obvious. Therefore, Lynch et al13 believe that the gov-
ernment and society in the United States should recognize
the need to improve public health as part of the economic
policy, which would be an important measure to enhance the
health of the population.
Work status is also an important factor that helps to
explain the health of individuals. For example, unemploy-
ment has a negative impact on people's health.17 Grayson's
study in Canada found that, when people have the same
level of exercise, the unemployed have poorer health com-
pared with the working population.18 Stuckler et al19 found
that for every 1% increase in unemployment in Europe,
there was a 0.79% rise in suicides among those aged below
65 years, and every $10 per person invested in labor market
programs reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides
by 0.038%.
Housing and community both have a direct impact on the
health of residents, for example, damp and moldy living con-
ditions have an adverse effect on health.20,21 Housing tenure
also has an effect on the health of residents. Ellaway and
Macintyre22 found that different types of housing tenures
expose people to different levels of health hazards. Gabe and
Williams23 found that there is a J-shaped relationship between
housing density and psychological symptoms, ie, low as well
as high levels of crowding are detrimental to psychological
health. In addition, the health of residents in different com-
munities can be very different. The health of residents living
in poor communities is generally lower than that of those
living in affluent communities. High crime rates and chaotic
living conditions in poor communities are important factors
that affect the health of residents.24 Aneshensel and Sucoff25
analyzed a community-based sample of 877 adolescents in
Los Angeles County and found that youth in low-SES
neighborhoods perceived more hazards in their local envi-
ronment than those in high-SES neighborhoods.
It should be noted that the impacts of social and economic
conditions and the impacts of the physical environment on
health do not only act in a single direction. People often take
proactive measures to change their poor living environments
in order to improve their health and that of their families.
Kearns and Parkes26 found that dissatisfaction and annoy-
ance with a given neighborhood significantly increases the
likelihood of residential mobility. Areas that attract migrants
from other areas will, in the long run, develop healthier
populations.27
Building healthy spaces is an important way to maintain
or enhance the health of individuals and families.28 Several
studies have found that transnational migrants often maintain
their original customs in order to provide healthy living
spaces for their families.29 Dyck and Dossa30 found that
migrant women from India and Afghanistan in Canada con-
tinued to practice their customs related to food preparation
and consumption, traditional healing, and religious obser-
vance, which enhanced the physical, social, and symbolic
dimensions of their living environment for their families.
Overall, migrant is one of the main research objects of the
researches on health. And the existing research on factors
that affect health has largely been carried out in the West and
in China. From the above, we can see that personal factors,
work-related factors, housing factors, medical and pension
insurance factors, community factors, and urban life factors
are the main factors, which affect migrants' health. Still, it is
valuable to analyze the health of migrants from geographical
and urban planning perspective in China's context. In this
article, our focus is on the neighborhood. We try to answer
the following questions: How is the status of health of
migrants in different neighborhoods? and What are the influ-
ences of neighborhood on the health of migrants? This article
contributes to the literature on health of migrants in China by
first investigating the impact of neighborhood. The next sec-
tion introduces the data collection and methods. Third sec-
tion is empirical findings from the Guangzhou survey. The
article concludes with a summary of key findings and a
discussion.
Data and Methods
In this article, we analyzed data from the urban areas of the
Chinese city of Guangzhou. The data concerned the health
of migrants, where migrants refer to those who were regis-
tered as temporary residents in Guangzhou. The main data
set used in this article was collected via a questionnaire sur-
vey that was conducted in Guangzhou from September to
November 2015.
We explored data from 4 types of neighborhood: older
inner city neighborhood (which are known as jiefang shequ),
unit neighborhoods (which are known as danwei, or "work
units," which used to be integrated work and living spaces
Hongsheng et al 3
that acted as the basic unit of urban organization for the
state), urban villages, and private housing neighborhoods.
Figure 1 shows the locations of the 18 sampled neighbor-
hoods. Among them, we collected 61 valid questionnaires
from migrants in older inner city neighborhoods, 67 from
migrants in unit neighborhoods, 115 from migrants in urban
villages, and 84 from migrants in private housing
neighborhoods.
We collected data on migrants' self-assessed physical and
mental health scores, which were measured on a scale of 1 to
5, with 1 representing the worst health and 5 representing the
best health. To reflect the health of migrants more accurately,
we also took the average value between physical health
scores and mental health scores as "overall health score."
Based on the reviews and analysis, data were collected on the
following variables:
·
· Personal factors: gender (male or female), age (years),
length of residence (years), marital status (unmarried,
married, or others), education level (primary school
and below, high school, or college and above) and
annual household income
·
· Work-related factors: satisfaction with work score,
daily working hours, number of days of work per
month, type of workplace (government department,
private enterprise, or self-employed), farming dura-
tion, frequency of changing jobs, and type of work
(agricultural work or nonagricultural work)
·
· Housing factors: size of housing (m2), age of housing,
type of household (family household or nonfamily
household), housing ownership (owned housing or
nonowned housing), and age of housing (years)
·
· Medical and pension insurance factors: urban work-
ers' basic medical insurance, new rural cooperative
medical insurance, private enterprise employees'
basic pension insurance, and new rural social pension
insurance
·
· Community factors: community attachment score,
satisfaction with neighborhood score, community
awareness score, and community quality of life score
·
· Urban life factors: urban lifestyle fitness score, qual-
ity of diet score, satisfaction with Guangzhou score,
number of close friends in the city, and wishes to
return home
We used logistic regression models to quantify the effects
of personal factors, work-related factors, housing factors,
community factors, insurance factors, and urban life factors
on the migrants' health.
Results
Health of Migrants in Different Neighborhoods
As shown in Table 1, migrants in urban villages and private
housing neighborhoods had higher self-assessed physical
health scores, which were 4.51 and 4.46, respectively, and
migrants in older inner city neighborhoods and unit neigh-
borhoods had lower levels of health, with scores of 4.15 and
4.27, respectively. Regarding self-assessed mental health
scores, a similar pattern was exhibited, with migrants in
urban villages and private housing neighborhoods having
higher scores compared with migrants in older inner city
neighborhoods and unit neighborhoods. Regarding the over-
all health scores, migrants in urban villages and private hous-
ing neighborhoods had higher scores (both had scores of
3.99) compared with those in older inner city neighborhoods
and unit neighborhoods (both had scores of 3.76).
Using the sample mean of the overall health score (3.90)
as a threshold for good health, we calculated the proportions
of migrants in each of the 4 neighborhoods who had health
scores of greater than and less than the sample mean, which
were used to define those in "good health" and "poor health,"
respectively. The highest percentage of those with good
health was 61.7%, which was for migrants in urban villages.
The second highest percentage was 58.3%, which was for
migrants in private housing neighborhoods. The lowest per-
centage, 37.7%, was for migrants in older inner city
neighborhoods.
The association between various factors and the migrants'
health were analyzed, as shown in Table 2. Regarding gen-
der, the health score for males was higher than that for
females. The proportion of males with good health was 62%,
while that for females was 43%. Regarding marital status,
the proportion of unmarried individuals with good health

districts of Guangzhou.
4 INQUIRY
was 61%, while that for married individuals was 52%. There
were also health differences by age and length of residence.
For those in poor health, the mean age was 38 years and the
mean length of residence was 13 years, and for those in good
health, the mean age was 35 years and the mean length of
residence was 13 years. In addition, the higher the migrants'
education level, the higher the health scores. For migrants
who had primary education and below, 41% had good health.
For migrants who had college education and above, 61% had
good health.
Regarding work-related factors, for those migrants with
poor health, the mean of their daily working hours was 8.76
h, while those with good health worked a mean of 9.25 h.
Regarding the type of workplace, 55% and 57% of migrants
who worked in government departments and those who were
self-employed had good health, respectively. Migrants who
worked in private enterprises had comparatively lower health
scores.
A higher proportion of migrants who had social security-
related insurance had good health, apart from those who had
new rural social pension insurance, which indicates that a
sound social security system can improve migrants' health.
Migrants with good health had mean house sizes of 49.37 m2
and those with poor health had mean house sizes of 42.82 m2.
In addition, migrants who had good health had larger num-
bers of friends, better urban lifestyle fitness scores, and
higher satisfaction with neighborhood scores.
Factors That Influence Migrants' Health
First, using the overall health score as the dependent variable
and the personal factors as control variables in each of the
models, the following 6 regression models were estimated: a
personal factors model, a work-related factors model, a hous-
ing model, a community model, an insurance model, and an
urban life model. Subsequently, the statistically significant
independent variables in each of the 6 models were com-
bined in a comprehensive model, and the determinants of the
migrants' health scores were explored.
As shown in Table 3, in the personal factors model, gen-
der and age were statistically significant. The males' health
scores were higher than females', which may indicate that
males have more adaptability to urban life and work pres-
sure. In contrast, age had a statistically significant negative
relationship with health scores. Except in the work-related
factors model, the gender and age variables had similar
effects in the other 4 models.
In the work-related factors model, the number of days
worked per month and farming duration were statistically
significant, and they both had negative associations with the
health scores. The effect of the number of days worked per
month reveals that work intensity influences health, while
the variable on farming duration reveals that there may be
adaptability issues when migrants transfer from agricultural
to nonagricultural employment.
In the housing model, size of housing and age of housing
were important factors. The smaller the housing and the
older the housing, the greater the negative impact on
migrants' health scores. As research in the West has shown,
improvements to people's living situations can improve their
health.31 Similarly, the community has also been confirmed
to be an important dimension that can influence migrants'
health.32
In the community model, community awareness and com-
munity quality of life had a positive impact on migrants'
health scores. Therefore, enhancing community awareness
(e.g., by setting up community bulletins, other community
notification systems, and community events) and the quality
of life in the community may contribute to improving
migrants' health. In the insurance model, the variables con-
cerning urban workers' medical insurance and new rural
cooperative medical insurance were statistically significant,
as medical insurance promotes health. In the urban life
model, the degree of lifestyle adaptation score had a statisti-
cally significant impact. Adaptation to urban life tends to
help to improve health.
In the comprehensive model, gender, age, community
quality of life, and rural cooperative medical insurance were
the most important factors. That is to say, personal character-
istics, community factors, and insurance are the most promi-
nent factors that influence migrants' health.
Subsequently, physical health scores and mental health
scores were used as the dependent variables in 2 regression
analyses which tested the effects of the 27 variables from the
6 dimensions (i.e., personal factors, work-related factors,
housing factors, community factors, insurance factors, and
urban life factors).Aforward selection method was employed
in the regression analyses.

In the physical health score model, migrants'health scores
were statistically significantly influenced by age, age of
housing, pension and medical insurance, and type of
workplace. Among these, age and housing completion time
had a negative impact on the physical health scores, while
the new rural social pension insurance and the urban work-
ers' basic medical insurance each had a positive impact on
the physical health scores. Compared with those working in
government departments, migrants who worked in private
enterprises had lower health scores, which is likely to have
been due to the work intensity.
In the mental health score model, community quality of
life and community awareness were important factors that
influenced migrants' mental health scores. Therefore,
enhancing the quality of communities may improve migrants'
health. The length of residence and the new rural social pen-
sion insurance have negative impacts on health. For migrants
who had lived in Guangzhou for a long period of time, the
willingness to settle down in Guangzhou was very high, but
there are high levels of economic pressure in Guangzhou so
migrants often face high levels of psychological pressure.
Meanwhile, although the new rural social pension insurance
is handled, willingness to return home is not high, which
resulted in the negative impact of this variable. Moreover, in
terms of migrants mainly engaged in labor-intensive indus-
tries, their daily working hours are proportional to their
income and greater income helps to relieve life pressures.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study measured and analyzed older inner city neighbor-
hoods, unit neighborhoods, urban villages, and private hous-
ing neighborhoods in Guangzhou. Regarding self-assessed
physical and mental health scores, the scores of migrants in
urban villages and private housing neighborhoods were higher
than those of migrants in older inner city neighborhoods and
unit neighborhoods. The migrants in the urban villages tend to
be young, and in the private housing, neighborhoods tend to
have better SES, which are important reasons behind these
phenomena. Urban villages and private housing neighbor-
hoods located at prosperous areas of cities are emerging resi-
dential communities after the reform and opening up, while
older inner city neighborhoods and unit neighborhoods mostly
formed in the planned economy era. The health level of
migrants in the former neighborhoods is higher than that of
migrants in the latter neighborhoods, which partly reflects that
the growth and the development of economy influence the
health level of migrants in a positive way.
Regarding the different dimensions of health, migrants'
self-assessed mental health scores were far lower than their
self-assessed physical health scores. Migrants in urban vil-
lages had the largest gap between the 2 scores, and the gap
between the scores in different neighborhoods decreased
from unit neighborhoods to private housing neighborhoods
to older inner city neighborhoods.
Males had better health than females, and there was a
higher proportion of younger people with good health com-
pared with older people. The migrants' education levels had

a positive correlation with their health scores. Migrants who
worked in government departments and those who were self-
employed had higher health scores than migrants who
worked in private enterprises. Compared with private enter-
prises, social welfare of governmental agency unit is better.
In the period of the planned economy, the social welfare of
employees in China is mainly affected by their work units or
the related rules and institutions. The social status of differ-
ent employees with different social welfare varied a lot.
However, in the marketization reform process, social welfare
of employees in different employment sectors still has a large
difference. Narrowing the welfare gap between different
employment sectors is still an important part of China's
reform.
Migrants whose health scores were higher tended to have
more comprehensive insurance, larger housing, larger num-
bers of friends, better urban lifestyle fitness scores, and
greater levels of satisfaction with their neighborhoods.
Personal characteristics, community factors, and insurance
are the most prominent factors that influence migrants'health
scores. Among the influential factors associated with physi-
cal health scores, age, size and age of housing, pension insur-
ance, and medical insurance are important. Age of housing
had a negative impact, while insurance had a positive impact
on health scores. Among the influential factors associated
with mental health scores, community was an important fac-
tor. Health insurance is one of the important influence factors
on health of migrants. In the context of China's current spe-
cial background, registered residence (known as hukou) is a
threshold for migrants to become urbanite.33 In this case,
improving migrant's health insurance means a lot for nar-
rowing social welfare between urban and rural migrants.
Most of the rural migrants in city are at the bottom of the
heap. Because the social welfare system is not perfect, when
they get injured or are suffering from diseases such as pneu-
moconiosis, they will lose the ability and opportunity to con-
tinue to work in urban area. They have to return to the rural
areas (their hometown), thus lowering the health level of
rural places. It should be noted that rural areas where the
social welfare system is less developed face the biggest
health risk. Cities have better welfare system, while the gov-
ernment investments of the public services in rural areas are
far from enough, which is also the current controversial
China's dualistic urban-rural structure.
The findings show that, in order to improve migrants'
health, strategies should be targeted to the different types of
neighborhood. Enhancing the quality of communities and
the environment may improve migrants' health. Migrants in
private housing neighborhoods have relatively high SES,
and the market-oriented approach in these neighborhoods
may help to protect and improve their health. However,
migrants in the other 3 neighborhoods, especially in the
urban villages and the older inner city neighborhoods,
should be given more support from the government and the
wider community. The quality of housing, the environment,
and the public facilities need to be gradually upgraded. In
addition, improvements to the insurance systems and the
promotion of social integration are important ways to
enhance migrants' health. In this article, we use subjective
variables to study the health of migrants from the perspec-
tive of migrants. This study reflects the respondents' own
subjective understanding of their own health. Of course, we
can also see the differences between this subjective evalua-
tion and objective evaluation. Subjective evaluation may
not be a true reflection of the real health of the respondents.
Taking health assessment index like body mass index, blood
pressure, lipids, etc, as evaluation criteria may reflect a
more scientific reflection of migrants' health. But as a self-
health evaluation research, this study is worth trying. In the
future, based on the research, we will use objective indica-
tors to conduct more objective studies of the migrants'
health. In addition, there are a lot of health issues that still
need to be explored, especially regarding the effects of dif-
ferent neighborhood and environments. The effect of envi-
ronmental strategies on migrants' health should be studied
further using specific neighborhood case studies.
