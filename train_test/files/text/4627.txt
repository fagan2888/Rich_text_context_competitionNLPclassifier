Abstract
Objective: To identify the demographic patterns of mortality, the time spent before death in the
emergency department (ED), and the causes of fatal outcomes.
Methods: We performed a 5-year (01/01/2011 to 01/01/2016) retrospective analysis of all non-
traumatic deaths in the ED of the UMHAT ­ Pleven. To extract the necessary information, we used
the registers in the ED until the patients' death.
Results: Among 156,848 patients in the study period, 381 died and the mortality rate was 2.4/
100000. The male:female ratio was 1.48:1. The 71­80 years age group was the most affected. The
mean (SD) age of patients who died in the ED was 69.9 Æ 8.4 years. Most non-traumatic deaths
(222 cases) were due to cardiovascular disease. Most patients (70.9%) died within 2.3 h after
arrival. The factors contributing to mortality included poverty, transporting the patient to hospital
too late, and a lack of developed care centres for terminally ill patients.
Conclusion: Most patients die within approximately 2 h after arrival at the ED. The main cause of
death is acute myocardial infarction. Pulmonary embolism remains unrecognized in most patients
(69%). Oncological pathology is among the main causes (7.4%) of mortality.

Significance of the problem
The emergency department (ED) is the
`face' of any hospital and it provides details
on the quality of patient care in the institu-
tion. The University Hospital for Active
Treatment, ``Dr Georgi Stranski'', which is
located in the city of Pleven, is the main
healthcare centre in the Northwest region of
Bulgaria. The population in this region
at the end of 1998 was 593,546 people or
7.2% of the population of Bulgaria. The
latest data released by the World Health
Organization show that cardiovascular dis-
ease is the leading cause of death world-
wide.1 Data from the National Statistical
Institute shows a similar trend for Bulgaria.2
In 2010, approximately 110,000 deaths were
registered in Bulgaria, of which 74,000 were
caused by diseases of the cardiovascular
system. In the emergency aid system, analy-
sis of epidemiological indicators is one of the
essential tools for process management.1,2,3
Outpatient and inpatient mortality have
been studied,2­10,16 as well as mortality in
EDs.12­14 However, there have been no
studies on the causes of death in EDs in
Bulgaria using data from autopsy reports
and the definite cause of death.
Aim: This study aimed to identify the
demographic patterns of mortality, the time
spent before death in the ED, and the causes
of fatal outcomes in an ED in Bulgaria.
Methods: We performed a 5-year retro-
spective analysis from 1 January, 2011 to 1
January, 2016 of all non-traumatic deaths in
the ED of the University Hospital for Active
Treatment in Pleven. To extract the neces-
sary information, we used the registers in the
hospital information system, outpatient
journals, outpatient sheets, consultation
sheets, and autopsy reports. From these,
we collected information on the demographic
indicators, causes of death, and the length of
time from a patient's admission in the ED
until death. To analyse the data, we performed
descriptive, variational, and graphical analysis
methods, as well as tests for identifying
dependencies using MS Excel (Data Analysis
Tool Pack) and SPSS software products.
Outcomes and discussion
From 1 January, 2011 to 1 January, 2016 a
total of 156,848 people were registered in the
ED of the University Hospital ``Dr. Georgi
Stranski'' in Pleven (Figure 1). Among
these, 381 of them died, despite conducting
resuscitation. The mortality rate was 2.4/
100,000 people who were registered, which is
a similar rate (2.7/100,000) to that in other
studies.9,13
In 350 deaths, an autopsy was performed,
and then each case was discussed at a clinical
meeting in the ED to eliminate errors and
optimize the protocols of behaviour. No
autopsy was performed in only 31 people at
the insistence of relatives.
In the 350 people who died and had an
autopsycarriedout,distributionbysexshowed
a prevalence of men. According to admission
records, more than 2/3 of the patients were
brought to the ED by Emergency Medical Aid
Centre (EMAC) teams.
A total of 139 people died of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI was the
most common cause of sudden death in the
ED and represented 39.7% of the total
mortality in this department.
The mortality rate of AMI ranged from
20 to 35 deaths per year or approximately
three per month (Figure 3). The average age
of people who died from AMI was 73.1
years, with a male prevalence. The number
1554 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
of people brought to the ED by the EMAC
team was almost twice that of those who
sought help themselves. The average stay of
these patients in the resuscitation area was
1:56 h. A total of 77 of these patients died
after staying in the ED for shorter than 1 h
and 28 who were brought by EMAC teams
were in a state of clinical death.
Compared with the total mortality in the
department there was a direct correlation
(p=1). The number of deaths due to AMI
was constant (35%39% of deaths in the ED)
in each year of the 5-year period ( figure 3.)
The second leading cause of death in
the 350 people who were autopsied was
pulmonary embolism (PE). A total of 44

(12.6%) people died because of PE during
the study period (Figures 2 and 4).
Patients with PE were mainly brought
to the ED by EMAC teams (n ¼ 34). Ten
patients with PE sought help by their own
means.
Unlike patients who died from AMI, in
patients with PE, there was no significant
difference in the distribution of sex. A total
of 52% of patients with PE were men. The
average age of patients who died from PE
was 71 years. The youngest patient with PE

was 37 years old and the oldest was 92 years.
The average stay in the resuscitation area
was 1:44 h. In 26 patients with PE, the visit
to the ED was less than 1 h, and 20 of them
were brought in a state of clinical death with
immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. In analysis of the autopsy
reports and outpatient sheets, we observed
that the teams in the ED suspected PE
for only 14 deaths. In the other patients,
the clinical diagnosis (observation) was dif-
ferent (Table 2).
This finding suggested that there is
an ineffective mechanism for recognizing
the symptoms of the second most common
cause of death in the ED. Non-use of some

modern, fast, and non-invasive diagnos-
tic methods, such as ultrasound, in the
ED leads to confusion and misdiagnosis.
The Canadian Emergency Ultrasound
Society recommends that all emergency phys-
icians take a course in emergency ultrasound.
To obtain a certificate, they are required to
perform at least 50 scans in each of the
following four categories: the heart, for
exclusion of pericardial tamponade; the
aorta, for measuring its diameter to exclude
aneurysm/dissection; the abdomen, to detect
freely flowing liquid; and the uterus, to
exclude ectopic pregnancy.11 Indirect ultra-
sound signs for right ventricular volume
overload are important for diagnosing PE,
and misapplying them indirectly leads to the
results found in our study.
Generally, the group of cardiovascular
diseases (Table 3), including AMI, PE,
aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade, and
ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, was
found in 222 (63%) patients among all
deceased and autopsied patients in the
ED during the study period. These
data are similar to data from other
studies that investigated the causes of
death4,5 in EDs.

cause of death in the ED in our study.
Despite all efforts, acute respiratory failure
that occurred due to an inflammatory lung
disease was the cause of death of 38 people
over the 5-year period, or nearly 10% of all
deaths in the ED.
The mortality rate of patients with
community-acquired pneumonia ranged
between 5 and 9 people per year, and the
average age of death was 67.3 years. There was
a high prevalence of male sex in these patients,
comprising 29 men and only nine women. The
average stay of a patient in the resuscitation
area until the time of death was 2:18h.
Among the main causes of mortality,
7.4% of the deaths in the ED were due to
advanced carcinomas (Table 4). A lack of
comprehensive care for patients with cancer
in Bulgaria forces the relatives of these
patients to seek help in the ED.
During the 5-year study period, 40 people
died of acute diseases of the gastrointestinal
tract, comprising 11% of the total mortality.
The most common cause of this mortality
was GI bleeding in 24 patients. The average
age of these patients was 70.4 years, with a
female prevalence (58%). The average stay
in the resuscitation area was 1:34 h.
A total of 0.9% to 4.6% of deaths were
due to other causes.
Aortic dissection, ischaemic and haemor-
rhagic stroke, and sepsis were relatively
similar in prevalence, with 10 to 16 cases in
the 5-year study period.
The least common causes of death in the
ED were frostbite in one patient (man, 75
years old) who died in 2011, and cardiac
tamponade in one patient (woman, 83 years
old) who died in 2013 with the clinical
picture of cardiogenic shock.

The monthly distribution of deaths in the
ED showed a peak of deaths in the spring
and autumn to winter seasons. This finding
is similar to a study of mortality in the EDs
in Bulgaria.4
Conclusions
(1) Most patients (70.9%) died within 2.3 h
after arrival at the ED, with the majority
(77%) being brought to the ED by
EMAC teams.
(2) The observed mortality shows similar
results to some previous studies.7,13
(3) Mortality among older patients is
prevalent in the ED, and men are more
vulnerable.
(4) The leading cause of death is cardiovas-
cular disease, and the most common
cardiovascular disease is AMI.
(5) Pulmonary embolism remains unrecog-
nized in the majority of cases.
(6) Not using some modern, rapid, and
non-invasive diagnostic methods, such
as ultrasound, in EDs leads to confu-
sion and misdiagnosis. The Canadian
Emergency Ultrasound Society recom-
mends that all emergency physicians
take a course in emergency ultrasound.
To obtain a certificate, they are
required to perform at least 50 scans
in each of the following four cate-
gories: the heart, to exclude pericardial
tamponade; the aorta, to measure its
diameter to exclude aneurysm/dissec-
tion; the abdomen, to detect freely
flowing liquid; and the uterus, to
exclude ectopic pregnancy.
(7) One of the main causes of mortality is
oncological pathology. A lack of com-
prehensive care for patients with cancer
in Bulgaria forces the relatives of these
patients to seek help in the ED where
they die.
(8) Discussing cases at clinical meetings
in the ED, and comparing the clinical
and pathological-anatomical diagnosis
contribute to eliminating errors and
optimizing the protocols of behaviour.
