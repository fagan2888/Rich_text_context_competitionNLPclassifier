Assignment of nutrient values to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) items does not usually account for partic-
ipant characteristics (besides age or sex) that may influence eating patterns. For the Southern Community Cohort
Study, the authors developed and assessed results from a nutrient database system incorporating sex-, race-, and
census-region-specific food lists, using 24-hour recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III, NHANES 1999­2000, NHANES 2001­2002, and NHANES 2003­2004) and the Continuing
Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals that permitted estimation of nutrients tailored to participants' characteristics.
For each of 15 nutrients, comparisons were made to a ``standard'' nutrient scoring system based on nationwide
race-blind 24-hour recalls from these same sources. Using FFQ data from 67,926 Southern Community Cohort
Study participants (47,038 African-American, 20,888 non-Hispanic white) aged 40­79 years who enrolled in the
study during 2002­2008, the region- and race-informed system tended to produce increased estimated intake
for most nutrients for black women, particularly for saturated fat (7.1%), monounsaturated fat (8.3%), and
polyunsaturated fat (7.2%); smaller but significant changes (<5%) were also observed for nutrient intake for
men and white women. These types of refinements in nutrient databases can be considered a means of enhancing
the accuracy of dietary estimation using FFQs.

Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are a cost-effective,
widely used means of dietary assessment in epidemiologic
studies and are a virtual necessity within the largest studies
(e.g., prospective cohort studies) when the goal is to elicit
a comprehensive estimate of subjects' average diets. At
a minimum, FFQs determine how often a subject consumes
foods that fall within a defined category, such as ``pizza'';
but unlike a detailed 24-hour dietary recall or diet record,
the investigator will often not know the type of pizza, how
it was prepared, or the serving size. To approximate those
details and ``score'' the FFQ (i.e., calculate nutrient intakes
for each participant), investigators may rely on a source of
24-hour dietary recalls from which to estimate an average
(1). Using external sources for these recalls (such as the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture's
Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII))
is an approach taken with widely used FFQs in the United
States (including the Block FFQ (2) and the National Can-
cer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire (3), versions of
which have been used in numerous studies). Implicit in this
approach is the assumption that the dietary habits of the
population providing the 24-hour recalls are a reasonable
representation of those of the study population; the less
true this assumption, the less reliable one would expect
the scoring to be. Studies such as NHANES and CSFII
aim to be nationally representative, but few US cohort
studies or other types of epidemiologic studies of diet

and disease are themselves comprised of a nationally rep-
resentative sample.
For the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) (4),
we developed an FFQ to be administered to a racially di-
verse group of adult participants from the southeastern
United States. In designing the questionnaire (described
elsewhere (5)), we aimed to include all pertinent food items
to allow comprehensive dietary assessment for both African
Americans and non-African Americans in the cohort. In
considering the assignment of nutrients to these food items,
we sought to develop a nutrient database that would incor-
porate the elements of race and geographic region and to test
the effect of these refinements on our final nutrient estima-
tion. We report herein on the development of this database
and the resulting nutrient indices for the cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The institutional review boards of the participating insti-
tutions approved SCCS activities and the manner in which
written informed consent was obtained from participants.
Study population
The SCCS is a prospective cohort investigation of racial
disparities in cancer occurrence in a 12-state area across the
southeastern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) (4).
Enrollment takes place via in-person recruitment at commu-
nity health centers and via mass mailings (84% and 16% of
participants to date, respectively). At the time of enrollment,
participants complete a baseline survey that includes the
SCCS FFQ. Most SCCS participants report their race as
being either non-Hispanic black/African-American (66%)
or non-Hispanic white/Caucasian (28%).
The present analysis was based on FFQ data obtained
from the baseline surveys of 67,926 SCCS cohort members
(47,038 black, 20,888 white) who enrolled in the study be-
tween March 2002 and April 2008. Participants were aged
40­79 years, spoke English, and had not been under treat-
ment for cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within
the past year.
The SCCS FFQ
The SCCS FFQ was empirically constructed using the
Third NHANES (NHANES III) 24-hour recall database to
include an optimal number and selection of foods that would
capture the main sources of energy and key nutrient intake
for African Americans and non-African Americans in the
South, as has been previously described (5). This FFQ was
both pilot-tested in a group of over 200 African-American
and white residents of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida
aged 40­79 years and evaluated in 2 subsequent focus
groups to arrive at the final version (5). It comprises 89
``items'' under the major headings ``fruits and fruit juices,''
``breakfast foods,'' ``vegetables,'' ``rice, beans, and pota-
toes,'' ``pasta, pizza, and soup,'' ``meat,'' ``breads,''
``spreads and dressings,'' ``dairy foods,'' ``desserts and
snacks,'' ``beverages,'' and ``seasonings and flavorings.''
An additional section elicits information on both the fre-
quency and quantity of consumption of alcoholic beverages.
The FFQ also contains 11 questions about the use of
vitamin/herbal supplements (although the present analysis
was restricted to nutrient estimation from nonsupplement
sources) and a variety of questions about behaviors (e.g.,
removing skin from chicken, using fats to cook vegetables)
that affect nutrient values.
The FFQ items sometimes represent a single food (e.g.,
``bananas''), but most are comprised of sets of commonly
associated foods (e.g., ``oatmeal, cream of wheat, or other
hot cereals''). For each FFQ item, participants could select
from the following 9 frequency categories: ``never,''
``rarely,'' ``1 time per month,'' ``2­3 times per month,''
``1 time per week,'' ``2­3 times per week,'' ``4­6 times per
week,'' ``1 time per day,'' and ``2 or more times per day.''
The FFQ does not elicit information about portion size (6).
Source files of 24-hour dietary recalls and construction
of the nutrient databases
We compiled the data files from the 24-hour dietary re-
calls conducted within NHANES III (1988­1994), CSFII
(1994­1996; day 1 recalls) (7), NHANES 1999­2000,
NHANES 2001­2002, and NHANES 2003­2004 (day 1
recalls). The combination of these files was necessary in
order to obtain a sufficient number of subjects (particularly
African Americans) for robust calculations. Demographic
files contained an indicator for the age, race, sex, and US
Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West) of the
respondent. The southern census region is defined as
Alabama, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Delaware,
Florida,Georgia,Kentucky,Louisiana,Maryland,Mississippi,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. We restricted these data
sets to subjects in the age range 30­84 years who reported
their race as non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black and
whose records were not coded as being unreliable or
incomplete.
From the combined records meeting these criteria, we
used 24-hour recall data from 23,398 persons (4,485 from
the Northeast, 5,845 from the Midwest, 9,488 from the
South, and 3,580 from the West) who contributed 375,890
reports of 6,016 unique food codes. We assigned the major-
ity (5,245; 87%) of these food codes to our FFQ items, with
the remainder referring to foods that were not captured on
our FFQ. For example, the NHANES food code 57111000
(``bran chex'') was assigned to our FFQ item ``bran or high-
fiber cereals,'' the food code 24198740 (``chicken nuggets'')
to our FFQ item ``fried chicken or chicken nuggets,'' etc.
These assignments determined the individual foods that
would contribute to the nutrient averaging for each SCCS
FFQ item.
The individual food records obtained from the NHANES
and CSFII included the nutrient composition of the reported
food (sourced primarily from the US Department of Agri-
culture, although a subset of nutrient values from the orig-
inal NHANES III files was derived from the University of
Using Race and Region for Dietary Estimation 105
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:104­111
Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center). The nutrient
composition on a given record corresponded to the amount
of food (in grams) reported by the NHANES and CSFII
respondents. For each SCCS FFQ food item, we estimated
the average amount of food consumed (grams), the average
total energy intake, and the average intake of a set of macro-
and micronutrients by computing the mean of the values for
the individual foods assigned to that item. These were
weighted means in that individual foods contributed to the
average in proportion to the frequency (and gram weight)
with which they were reported. Using NHANES/CSFII rec-
ords from the southern region only, the median number of
food reports available for averaging within an FFQ item was
391 for white males, 371 for white females, 167 for black
males, and 200 for black females.
The resulting nutrient databases (arrays of the SCCS FFQ
items 3 nutrient values) were constructed using the com-
plete set of 24-hour recalls, as well as separately for strata
defined by sex, race, and census region. For example, for the
FFQ item ``bran or high-fiber cereals,'' we calculated an
overall average portion size and nutrient content based on
the list of cereals reported in the set of 24-hour recalls of all
women nationwide, of black women in the South, etc. In this
way, we constructed stratum-specific nutrient databases, al-
lowing the system to select the appropriate nutrient value for
an FFQ item based on the race, sex, and geographic region
of the participant.
While the use of older source files such as NHANES III
and CSFII provided a larger base of records with which to
enumerate foods that people eat, we thought their nutrient
values might be outdated in relation to the SCCS enrollment
period (2002­present), particularly for foods subject to for-
tification, processing, preservation, selective breeding, or
recipe changes. Therefore, we replaced the nutrient values
for earlier files with those taken from the NHANES 2003­
2004 file (if the food code was present in that file), or else
with the NHANES 2001­2002 values. Using this approach,
we updated the nutrient values for 94% of the food codes
present in NHANES III or CSFII (while keeping the original
portion size information). We used the same approach to
supply nutrient values to food codes that existed in earlier
files prior to a particular nutrient's being made available by
the US Department of Agriculture.
Statistical analysis
The FFQs for 72,891 SCCS participants were evaluated
and were scored if no more than 10 of the 89 items were
missing (n ¼ 71,559; 98%). After the scoring, we excluded
subjects (the approximate top and bottom 2.5%) whose total
energy intakes were outside the range of 600­8,000 kcal/
day, which left us with a final study population of 67,926
(27,822 black females, 19,216 black males, 12,709 white
females, and 8,179 white males).
The SCCS FFQ scoring system currently estimates intake
for 62 nutrient indices, including total energy intake. How-
ever, for clarity of this demonstration, we present results for
15 of these: total energy intake, the major macronutrients
(carbohydrate, protein, total fat, saturated fat, monounsatu-
rated fat, and polyunsaturated fat), and a selection of other
nutrients key to our planned future studies of diet and
chronic disease (cholesterol, calcium, dietary fiber, folate,
vitamin A, vitamin C, a-tocopherol, and lycopene). We
scored the FFQs first using sex-specific nutrient values ob-
tained from the nationwide race-blind 24-hour recalls (here-
after referred to as the ``standard'' scoring system) and then
from sex-specific values obtained from race-concordant 24-
hour recalls in the South (hereafter referred to as the ``re-
gion/race'' system) and assessed the difference in the mean
estimations from the former to the latter, using a paired t test
to determine statistical significance. Although the absolute
differences between the scoring of the 2 systems were of
primary interest to us, we also calculated energy-adjusted
differences by performing a linear regression analysis for
each nutrient with the change in nutrient intake as the de-
pendent variable and the change in total calories as an ad-
justment factor.
Because we plan to evaluate racial differences in dietary
intake and their potential relation to health disparities in the
SCCS, we also calculated black-white differences in nutri-
ent intake that would have resulted from the standard system
and those that resulted from the region/race system. We
evaluated variation between the scoring systems by compar-
ing the 95% confidence intervals around the black-white
difference.
FFQs are best used for ranking subjects' intakes, rather
than estimating absolute intakes. Therefore, for each nutri-
ent under investigation, we determined each participant's
quintile of intake based on the distribution of the entire
study population, first using the standard system and then
the region/race system. Agreement of quintile assignment
between the 2 systems was evaluated using the kappa (j)
statistic, with values being interpreted as follows: j ¼
0.00­0.20, slight agreement; j ¼ 0.21­0.40, fair agree-
ment; j ¼ 0.41­0.60, moderate agreement; j ¼ 0.61­
0.80, substantial agreement; and j ¼ 0.81­1.00, almost per-
fect agreement (8, 9). In this paper, we report nonweighted
j's (as opposed to weighted j's, which were uniformly
higher) because we do not intend misclassification into ad-
jacent quintiles to be credited with partial agreement.
The Statistical Analysis System, version 9.1, was used for
all analyses (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina), and
all P values are 2-sided.
RESULTS
Using the standard scoring system, the estimated mean
daily total energy intake was 2,228 kcal for black women,
1,958 kcal for white women, 3,154 kcal for black men, and
2,776 kcal for white men (generally higher than noted for
other prospective cohort studies) (10­12). Use of the region/
race system resulted in an increase in estimated energy in-
take for African Americans and a decrease for whites, al-
though, except for black women (with a 6% increase), the
total energy estimates between systems differed by less than
2% (Table 1). For black women, the region/race system
yielded higher average estimated intakes across all 15 nu-
trients, with the largest relative changes being observed for
fats (7.5% for total fat, 7.1% for saturated fat, 7.2% for
106 Signorello et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:104­111
polyunsaturated fat, and 8.3% for monounsaturated fat). The
values in Table 1 show differences in the group mean for
black women, and these were the result of broad individual
increases rather than the effect of a small proportion of black
women experiencing large increases: For all nutrients ex-
cept folate, vitamin A, a-tocopherol, and lycopene, nutrient
values increased for more than 85% of black women, and
there was an increase in total energy intake and fats for more
than 98%. Energy adjustment lessened the differences be-
tween the 2 scoring systems, but the region/race system still
produced significantly higher carbohydrate, vitamin A, and
vitamin C estimates among black women (data not shown).
The differences noted above were observed despite general
stability in the estimated amount of food consumed per day
in grams for black women (1.2%).
For black men, differences in mean nutrient values be-
tween the region/race and standard systems were small (less
than 5%), with the exception of vitamin C (11.9 mg, or
8.2%). For white men and women, the region/race system
resulted in slightly lower estimates for most nutrients as
compared with the standard system (Table 1). For white
women, there were decreases for all nutrients except cal-
cium (18.4 mg, or 2.4%), and for white men, there were
decreases for all nutrients except calcium (16.4 mg, or
1.7%) and lycopene (234.7 lg, or 3.4%).
Using the standard scoring system, black women were
estimated to consume 269.8 (13.8%) more kilocalories per
day than white women, despite consuming 11% less food by
gram weight (Table 2). When the FFQ was scored using the
region/race system, black women were still seen to consume
11% less food by gram weight, but the black-white differ-
ence in energy intake expanded to 436.5 kcal. Corres-
pondingly, the female black-white difference for the
macronutrients also increased 1.5- to 2-fold (from 12.6%
to 21.2% for carbohydrate, from 13.5% to 19.3% for pro-
tein, and from 11.9% to 22.9% for total fat). Similar relative
changes were seen for the individual types of fats, dietary
fiber, and a-tocopherol, and the difference for lycopene
changed directions when the region/race system was em-
ployed. For 13 of the 15 nutrient indices presented for
women, the 95% confidence intervals for the black-white
difference showed no overlap, indicating distinctly different
estimates resulting from the 2 systems. In contrast to these
findings for women, black-white differences for men re-
mained relatively stable using the standard system versus
the region/race system (Table 2), and most of the confidence

3,074 white males).

intervals for the racial difference were overlapping--the
exceptions being carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and vitamin
C (where the racial difference increased using the region/
race system).
Table 3 shows j values estimating the level of agreement
between nutrient quintile assignments for the standard sys-
tem and the region/race system. All of the j's showed sub-
stantial or better quintile agreement between the 2 systems
(j > 0.73). Within each race group, agreement tended to be
slightly lower for most nutrients among women compared
with men.
DISCUSSION
We found that using a nutrient database informed by
geographic region and race to score the SCCS FFQ re-
sulted in modest but meaningful differences in the esti-
mated intake of several nutrients. The changes were most
pronounced for black women, with the standard scoring
system tending to underestimate nutrient intake. The dif-
ferences between the 2 systems tended to be small for
black men and for whites. We had expected that changes
induced by the region/race system would be stronger for
African Americans than for whites, because the standard
system was based on an underlying population (NHANES
and CSFII) that was mostly (73%) white. The high level of
agreement we observed for nutrient quintile assignments
between the systems indicates that ignoring race and re-
gion would not preclude a valid categorical analysis within
our study, although other uses of the data that rely on
absolute values would be affected.
In supplemental analyses (results not presented), we re-
scored the FFQs after omitting region from consideration to
estimate what proportion of the effects noted in Table 1
could be achieved using race alone. Using the region/race
system as the ``gold standard,'' the region-blind scoring ap-
peared to be highly effective for black women with regard to
total energy intake and the macronutrients (where more than
90% of the change for each index would have been cap-
tured), but it would have over- or underestimated the true
values for most micronutrients for black women and for
most of the nutrient indices overall for men and white
women. Thus, we conclude that region is a necessary com-
ponent of our scoring system.
Our finding that caloric and nutrient intakes for black
women increased using the region/race system without an
appreciable increase in the amount of food consumed indi-
cates that the types of foods reported by black women in the
southern 24-hour recalls were preferentially calorie- and
fat-dense. This is observable in the food lists contributing to
the nutrient averaging. For example, for the SCCS FFQ item
``broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, or cauliflower,'' the food
reported most frequently in the 24-hour recalls for black
women in the southern region was ``cabbage, green, cooked,
fat added in cooking,'' as compared with ``broccoli, raw'' for
women of all races nationwide (the basis of the standard
system). Thus, the total fat grams attributed to this vegetable
item are higher (3.1 g vs. 1.7 g) for black women using the

region/race system than using the standard system, as is the
case for approximately 55% of the FFQ items. It is possible
that the region/race system overestimated nutrient intake for
black women (rather than the standard system's underestimat-
ing it). However, the region/race system relies on the principle
that black female participants in the SCCS, for example, have
eating habits closer to those of other black women in the
South than to those of groups heavily comprised of white
women from the Northeast, Midwest, and West. This is, we
believe, a reasonable judgment. The assignment of values
from any FFQ nutrient database is based on a set of such
judgments, although they are not always explicitly or publicly
examined. Aiming for concordance on race, sex, and geo-
graphic area would also be expected to produce better con-
cordance (between the NHANES and CSFII participants and
our SCCS population) on factors such as body size, socioeco-
nomic status, cultural and culinary practices, and activity pat-
terns that influence the types and amounts of food eaten.
Despite its wide use in epidemiologic studies, the FFQ is
subject to criticism (13, 14). Kristal and Potter (15) recently
pointed out the challenging nature of estimating dietary intake
from an instrument that by its nature does not elicit informa-
tion on foods actually consumed. With regard to the example
``beef, pork, or lamb as a sandwich or mixed dish, e.g., stew,
casserole, lasagna, etc.,'' they asked, ``How could one sensi-
bly assign a single nutrient composition to this item given the
enormous number of nutritionally dissimilar foods commonly
consumed. . . which could be included?'' (15, p. 1759). This is
a valid concern, and our goal was to effect an incremental
improvement, however small, that would result in nutrient
estimation more closely reflecting foods actually consumed.
A number of previous studies have reported poorer perfor-
mance on FFQs for blacks than for whites (based on correla-
tions between FFQ estimation and gold-standard food records
or 24-hour recalls) (16­19), with discussions of the need for
increasing attention to participant instructions or improving
instrument content/presentation. However, based on the re-
sults of our analysis, a contributing factor may also be un-
derlying FFQ nutrient databases that inaccurately represent
the distribution of foods eaten by African Americans.
Although we are aware of several examples of investiga-
tors' developing or adapting FFQ content to be functional
across racial/ethnic groups with different eating patterns
(16, 20­22), it is not the norm to use the same FFQ but
assign different nutrient values to individuals depending
on their race or other variables. Dreon et al. (23) previously
explored this question using an approach similar to ours
(race-specific weighting of foods) and concluded that there
was little advantage to race-specific nutrient estimation for
total fat, saturated fat, and vitamin A. Aside from differ-
ences in methods (i.e., they used a single, older source file,
the Second NHANES (NHANES II; 1976­1980), that
included fewer African Americans, combined sexes and re-
gions, and investigated only 3 nutrients), an important rea-
son why our results may differ pertains to the FFQ itself,
because various ways of constructing combined food items
can either increase (if nutrient densities are heterogeneous)
or decrease (if nutrient densities are homogeneous) the pos-
sibility of racial differences' being relevant. Tucker et al.
(24) have previously taken an intermediate approach, select-
ing weighting patterns that fell between those determined
from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

and the original weighting for their FFQ (from NHANES
II), with the resulting nutrient database then being applied in
a standard fashion to both Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
Tucker et al. found that this substantially improved the
validity of their FFQ for Hispanics without sacrificing
validity for non-Hispanic whites (24). Investigators in the
Multiethnic Cohort Study used a similar method to apply
ethnicity-specific weights for just a few of their FFQ com-
posite items (16). The approach we have implemented in the
SCCS (to be used for all participants) goes a step further and
allows fully race-dependent weighting for all FFQ items.
The SCCS FFQ scoring system relies on a very large set
of 24-hour recalls. We overcame the issue of the source file
time frame (for NHANES III and CSFII) not being coinci-
dent with the SCCS enrollment period through backwards
replacement of current nutrient values into older reports on
the same foods. In this way, we were able to make use of the
reports without using outdated nutrient values. Our esti-
mates would have been affected, however, by changes in
eating patterns over time. To maximize the available sample
size and to attain comparable mean ages between the study
populations (as the SCCS age distribution is skewed towards
younger ages), we allowed a somewhat broader age range
(30­84 years) for the NHANES/CSFII participants than for
the SCCS enrollees (40­79 years). We believe this is a minor
issue, and previous research has indicated that an age-based
scoring system does not improve FFQ nutrient estimation
(as long as portion size and sex are accounted for) (3). The
12 SCCS-area states are contained within the 17 states com-
prising the southern census region. To the extent that eating
habits differ in the 5 nonoverlapping states (particularly
Texas), we have not optimally refined our geographic re-
striction. Because we did not have information about indi-
vidual states, we cannot know how many NHANES and
CSFII participants came from these non-SCCS states or
whether their inclusion effected much change in our nutrient
estimation, but we also believe this is a minor issue.
In summary, investigators using FFQs, whether in diverse
populations or in homogeneous populations, may benefit
from incorporating specific characteristics of the study pop-
ulation into nutrient algorithms to refine estimation for in-
dividual groups. For the SCCS, these characteristics were
race and geographic region, but other pertinent factors (e.g.,
age, socioeconomic status, body size, health status) may
apply. The data necessary to construct stratum-specific nu-
trient databases are available (though not always publicly, as
was the case for census region for the NHANES files post-
1999). For investigators who use internal sources of 24-hour
recalls to construct databases (i.e., from their own study
participants), efforts could be made to collect recalls from
a sufficient number of persons within each group of interest
to achieve the same end. These refinements should be con-
sidered an additional way to enhance the accuracy of dietary
estimation using an FFQ.
