Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for hypertension.1 Since
the late 1970s, obesity has increased substantially in the United
States.2,3 The prevalence of hypertension, which decreased
from 1976­1980 to 1988­1994, subsequently increased by
1999­2000.4­6 It is very likely that people with hypertension
gained weight during this period of a rapid increase in obes-
ity in the United States, but this increase has not been shown.
An understanding of this issue is important for clinical rea-
sons because weight management is a key approach to the
treatment of people with hypertension.7,8 To shed light on the
trends in body mass index, waist circumference, and obesity
among US adults with hypertension, we examined data from
three national surveys spanning the period from 1976 to 2004.
In addition, we examined whether gender and ethnic differ-
ences existed in the prevalence of obesity and abdominal obes-
ity among adults with hypertension.
Methods
Study population. We used data from National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II (1976­1980),
NHANES III (1988­1994), and NHANES 1999­2004.9­11
Participants were selected using a stratified multistage prob-
ability sample design. After an interview in the home, partici-
pants were invited for an examination in the mobile exami-
nation center, where they were asked to complete additional
questionnaires, to undergo various examinations, and to
provide a blood sample. Each survey yields estimates that are
representative of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US popu-
lation. Experimental protocols and the process for obtaining
informed consent for NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002
were approved by institutional review committees of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For NHANES II,
internal human subject review was conducted.
Measurements. Hypertension was defined as a systolic
blood pressure 140mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure
90mmHg or the self-reported current use of antihyperten-
sive medication. Details about blood pressure measurements
can be found elsewhere.12,13 Two blood pressure record-
ings in the seated position were attempted for participants

Trends in Obesity and Abdominal Obesity Among
Hypertensive and Nonhypertensive Adults in the
United States

Background
As the prevalence of obesity has increased in the United States,
it is likely that the prevalence of obesity among people with
hypertension has increased as well. Because little is known about this
issue, our objective was to compare secular trends in the prevalence
of obesity and abdominal obesity among hypertensive and
nonhypertensive adults in the United States.
Methods
We used data from adults aged 18­74 years who participated in
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs)
during 1976­1980, 1988­1994, and 1999­2004.
Results
Among adults with hypertension, the age-adjusted mean body
mass index increased from 27.5kg/m2 during 1976­1980 to 31.2kg/
m2 during 1999­2004 (P < 0.001), and the age-adjusted prevalence
of obesity increased from 25.7­50.8% (P < 0.001). Among adults
without hypertension, mean body mass index increased from 24.2­
27.1kg/m2 (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of obesity increased from
8.4­25.1% (P < 0.001).The prevalence of obesity among women with
hypertension exceeded that among men with hypertension during
all three surveys (P < 0.05 for all three surveys). During 1999­2004,
56.4% (s.e. 3.4) of women with hypertension were obese compared
with 46.9% (s.e. 2.1) of men. During this same time period, the
prevalence of obesity was highest among Mexican-American women
with hypertension (63.8%; s.e. 4.2) and lowest among African-
American men with hypertension (43.8%; s.e. 2.5).
Conclusions
Over half of people with hypertension are currently obese.
The large increase in obesity among people with hypertension
presents clinicians with a serious challenge in the management of
hypertension.

in NHANES II, up to three readings in NHANES III, and
up to four readings in NHANES 1999­2004. For NHANES
II, we used the second systolic and diastolic blood pressure
measurements for participants who had two measurements
and used a single measurement for participants who had
one systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement. For
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004, we used the average
of the last two measurements of blood pressure for partici-
pants who had three measurements, the last measurement
for participants with only two measurements, and the only
measurement for participants who had one measurement
to establish hypertension status. For all three surveys, we
counted participants who reported currently using an anti-
hypertensive medication from the following questions as
having hypertension:
NHANES II: Are you now taking any medicine prescribed
by a doctor for your (high blood pressure/hypertension)?
NHANES III: Because of your (high blood pressure/hyper-
tension), have you ever been told by a doctor or other health
professional to take prescribed medicine? Are you now taking
prescribed medicine?
NHANES 1999­2004: Because of your (high blood pres-
sure/hypertension), have you ever been told to take prescribed
medicine? Are you now taking prescribed medicine?
Body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated from measured
height and weight. Obesity was defined as a body mass index
30kg/m2. Waist circumference, which was assessed only
in NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004, was measured at
the high point of the iliac crest at minimal respiration to the

nearest 0.1cm. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist cir-
cumference >102cm in men and >88cm in women.14
Statistical analysis. We examined trends in obesity and
abdominal obesity among adults with and without hyperten-
sion, among men and women, and among whites, African
Americans, and Mexican Americans (for NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2004 only). We limited the analyses of the sur-
veys to men and nonpregnant women aged 18­74 years who
attended the medical examination. The analytic samples for
participants with hypertension numbered 4,990 in NHANES
II, 3,644 in NHANES III, and 3,554 in NHANES 1999­2004. To
age-adjust statistics, we directly adjusted to the US-projected
population aged 18­74 years in the year 2000.15 We tested
the statistical significance of the changes in mean body mass
index, mean waist circumference, and the prevalence of obes-
ity and abdominal obesity between two surveys by using a
t-test or 2-test. The pooled standard error for the difference in
means or percentages was calculated by taking the square root
of the sum of the squared standard errors. We used SUDAAN
(Software for the Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data) for
analyses to account for the complex sampling design.
Results
The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 35.4% in
NHANES II, 20.8% in NHANES III, and 25.4% in NHANES
1999­2004. The age-adjusted mean body mass index increased
by 3.8kg/m2 among all adults with hypertension (from 27.5 to
31.2kg/m2), by 3.7kg/m2 among men (from 26.9 to 30.5kg/
m2), and by 3.7kg/m2 among women (from 28.6 to 32.4kg/
m2) (Figure 1). Of note, is that the mean body mass index
value surpassed 30kg/m2 for men and women during the
1999­2004 period. Mean body mass index increased sig-
nificantly (P < 0.05 for all three surveys) in all major ethnic
and sex groups except Mexican-American men (Figure 2).
Among participants without hypertension, the age-adjusted
mean body mass index increased by 2.9kg/m2 (men: 2.5kg/m2
women: 3.2kg/m2) (all P < 0.001). Significant increases rang-
ing from 0.6kg/m2 in Mexican-American men to 4.2kg/m2 in
African-American women were noted in all major ethnic and
sex groups except Mexican-American women.
Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity doubled
approximately from 25.7% during 1976­1980 to 50.8% during
1999­2004 (Figure 1). The change in the prevalence of obes-
ity was particularly striking among men where the prevalence
escalated from 20.1 to 46.9%. For each survey, the age-adjusted
prevalence of obesity among women with hypertension sig-
nificantly exceeded that among men with hypertension (P <
0.001 for NHANES II; P = 0.001 for NHANES III; P = 0.018 for
NHANES 1999­2004). Among white men, African-American
men, and African-American women, obesity increased progres-
sively over the three surveys (Figure 2). Among white women,
obesity increased strongly between 1976­1980 and 1988­1994
but did not increase further. Among Mexican Americans, obes-
ity increased from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004. The prevalence of
obesity was significantly higher during 1999­2004 than during
1976­1980 among white men (P < 0.001), African-American
men (P < 0.001), and white women (P = 0.018). In addition,
it was significantly increased during 1999­2004 than during
1988­1994 among Mexican-American men (P = 0.036) and
among Mexican-American women (P = 0.022).
Among participants without hypertension, the age-adjusted
prevalence of obesity increased from 8.4 to 25.1% (P < 0.001).
The prevalence increased from 6.9 to 23.4% (P < 0.001) among
men and from 9.6 to 26.8% (P < 0.001) among women. From
1976­1980 to 1999­2004, the prevalence of obesity increased
significantly among white men (P < 0.001), among African-
American men (P = 0.041), white women (P < 0.001), and
African-American women (P < 0.001). From 1988­1994 to
1999­2004, the prevalence of obesity also increased signifi-
cantly among Mexican-American men (P = 0.049) but not
women (P = 0.293).
The age-adjusted mean waist circumference increased from
101.3 to 103.7cm among all hypertensive adults (P = 0.037),
from 101.9 to 105.7cm among hypertensive men (P = 0.002), and
from 101.2 to 101.4cm among hypertensive women (P = 0.923)
(Figure3). Although the mean waist circumference was higher in
1999­2004 than in 1988­1994 in all major racial and sex groups
except white women, the increases were significant only among
white (P = 0.009) and African-American men (P = 0.027) and
nearly so among Mexican-American men (P = 0.078) (Figure 4).
Among participants without hypertension, the age-
adjusted
mean waist circumference increased by 3.9cm (P < 0.001)

among all participants, 3.5cm among men (P < 0.001), and
4.0cm among women (P < 0.001). Waist circumference
increased by 3.9cm among white men (P < 0.001), 2.6cm
among African-American men (P < 0.001), 2.0cm among
Mexican-American men (P = 0.001), 4.4cm among white
women (P < 0.001), 4.2cm among African-American women
(P < 0.001), and 1.8cm among Mexican-American women
(P = 0.058).

Obesity Trends in Hypertension
The age-adjusted prevalence of abdominal obesity
increased from 56.4% in NHANES III to 65.7% in NHANES
1999­2004 (P = 0.005) and was particularly pronounced
among hypertensive men (from 44.9 to 58.6%; P = 0.001)
(Figure 3). The prevalence of abdominal obesity among
hypertensive women significantly exceeded that among men
in each survey (P < 0.001 for NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2004). The prevalence of abdominal obesity increased
significantly among white men (P = 0.005) and African-
American men (P < 0.001). Among Mexican-American
men and white, African-American, and Mexican-American
women, no significant changes in the prevalence of abdomi-
nal obesity were noted.
Among participants without hypertension, the age-adjusted
prevalence of abdominal obesity increased from 31.5% during
1988­1994 to 41.2% during 1999­2004 (P < 0.001). The prev-
alence increased from 23.5 to 32.4% among men (P < 0.001)
and from 38.9 to 50.3% among women (P < 0.001). Significant
increases were observed in all major ethnic and sex groups
except for Mexican-American women.
Discussion
Since 1976­1980, the age-adjusted prevalence of obes-
ity among people with hypertension increased significantly
among US adults. Thus, during the period of 1999­2004,
approximately half of all adults with hypertension were obese
representing a near doubling of the prevalence of obesity over
an ~25-year period. Similarly, the age-adjusted prevalence of
abdominal obesity has increased since 1988­1994, and almost
two-thirds of adults with hypertension had abdominal obesity
during the period of 1999­2004. Although the prevalence of
obesity among men with hypertension was significantly higher
at each survey (P < 0.001 for 1988­1994 vs. 1976­1980 and P =
0.029 for 1999­2004 vs. 1988­1994), a significant increase in
the prevalence of obesity among women occurred only from
1976­1980 to 1988­1994. The prevalence of obesity among
women was higher during 1999­2004 than during the preced-
ing survey, but this increase was not statistically significant
(P = 0.844). For each of the three surveys, the prevalence of
obesity in women with hypertension exceeded that in men
with hypertension and was especially high among Mexican-
American women.
Compared with participants who did not have hypertension,
those with hypertension had a higher age-adjusted mean body
mass index and a higher age-adjusted prevalence of obes-
ity. From 1976­1980 to 1999­2004, the prevalence of obesity
increased by an absolute 25.2% among adults with hyperten-
sion and 16.7% among those without hypertension. However,
because the baseline prevalence of obesity was much higher
among adults with hypertension than among those without
hypertension, the relative increase in the prevalence of obesity
among adults with hypertension (98%) was smaller than that
among those without hypertension (199%). Among men and
women, the gap in mean body mass index between participants
with hypertension and those without it tended to widen from
1976­1980 to 1988­1994, but the gap did not widen further
thereafter. Among African-American men, however, the gap
in mean body mass index between participants with hyperten-
sion and those without it progressively widened whereas the
gap among African-American women narrowed during the
study period.
These trends in the prevalence of obesity are troubling
because weight management is a key strategy in controlling
hypertension. Some patients with adequate weight control
could potentially free themselves of having to use antihyper-
tensive medication. Others could reduce the number and doses
of medications.16 A recent meta-analysis estimated that for
every kilogram of weight loss, systolic blood pressure would
decrease by 1.05mmHg (95% confidence interval: 0.66­1.43)
and diastolic blood pressure would decrease by 0.92mmHg
(95% confidence interval: 0.55­1.28).17
Although the ultimate responsibility for achieving a healthy
weight rests with the patient, the patient's family, clinicians, and
others can play major supportive roles. For those who should
lose weight, negative energy balance must be accomplished
through limiting energy intake, increasing energy expendi-
ture in the absence of contraindications, or both. The National
Weight Loss Registry demonstrated that those who were suc-
cessful in maintaining long-term weight loss tended to consume
low-fat diets, monitor their body weight and food intake fre-
quently, engage in high levels of physical activity, and minimize
watching television.18,19 Clinicians can make major contribu-
tions to the welfare of their hypertensive patients by assessing
their patients' dietary habits and physical activity habits as well
as by providing appropriate counseling and referrals. When
nonpharmacologic approaches fail to achieve desired results,
clinicians can judiciously prescribe medication to help promote
weight loss. Bariatric surgery for patients with an appropri-
ate indication can have a major beneficial impact not only on
body weight but on hypertension as well.20 For those who are
employed, worksite health promotion programs can provide
opportunities for weight control.21 On a societal level, making
the physical environment conducive to the promotion of ade-
quate physical activity provides opportunities for all, including
those who have hypertension, to help manage their weight.22
The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High
Blood Pressure (JNC7) recommends that patients with hyper-
tension have a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.9kg/m2.23
This recommendation is supported by a statement from the
American Heart Association.24 For patients who are unable to
achieve a body mass index in this range, however, weight loss on
the order of magnitude of 10% can result in favorable changes in
blood pressure. Furthermore, weight stabilization is an appro-
priate initial goal for those patients whose weight is increasing.
In conclusion, sizeable increases in obesity from 1976­1980
to 1999­2004 and in abdominal obesity from 1988­1994
to 1999­2004 occurred among adults with hypertension in
the United States. Given the adverse impact of excess weight
on blood pressure levels and control, the increase in obesity
among adults with hypertension suggests that many of them
will require additional, and perhaps to some degree avoidable,

pharmacological treatment. The increases and the magnitude
of obesity among adults with hypertension argue that the treat-
ment of obesity should be a major focus in the management of
hypertension.
