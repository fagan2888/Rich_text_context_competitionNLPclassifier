Indigenous Customs and Colonial Law:
Contestations in Religion, Gender, and
Family Among Matrilineal Mappila Muslims
in Colonial Malabar, Kerala, c. 1910-1928

Abstract
This article looks at the contesting articulations of gender, family, and religion in colonial South India. The article discusses
the encounter between matrilineal customs and the Anglo-Muhammadan law in the site of Mappila Muslim matrilineal
practices in colonial Malabar, of the Madras Presidency during c. 1910-1928. Young male members of the joint family used
the language that matriliny is un-Islamic, and passed laws in the Legislative Assembly to demand that joint family property
requires to be inherited in the patrilineal line. Three legislations were passed during the period of 1910-1940 to bring
Muslim families in accordance with the ideal notions of familial organization existed in that period. The ideal notions were
set up by the precepts of the Anglo-Muhammadan law, the orientalist knowledge of Islam, ideologies of colonial modernity,
and dreams of caste and religious reform movements among the people of Malabar, and other neighboring states, Cochin
and Travancore. In response to that, there was a re-articulation of customs and familial practices by using legal provisions
available in the Islamic law, and an effort for justifying the practices to avoid the ruin of matriliny. Subsequently, the
matrilineal Mappilas of Malabar retained matrilineal customs rather intact, though the gender relations and religious
practices were re-articulated in the idioms of patriarchy and textuality.

Introduction
This article will discuss the encounter between matrilineal
customs and the Anglo-Muhammadan law in the site of
Mappila Muslim matrilineal practices in Colonial Malabar,
of the Madras Presidency during c. 1910-1928. Law and
customs had a social life in Malabar. There were debates in
the realm of family and on the inheritance of property.
These debates always informed religious beliefs and rituals.
They also influenced the modes of gendering among
Muslims. Three legislations were passed during the period
of 1910-1940 to bring Muslim families in accordance with
the ideal notions of familial organization existed in that
period. The ideal notions were set up by the precepts of the
Anglo-Muhammadan law, the orientalist knowledge of
Islam, ideas of social progress, and dreams of caste and
religious reforms movements in Malabar, and in other
neighboring states of Cochin and Travancore (see Arunima,
2003; Devika, 2005; Velayudhan, 1998).
There were three legislations that covered regions of
Malabar, a district of Madras presidency, and some areas of
South Kanara (Balakrishnan 1981; Benaseer 2005). The
matriliny was called as marumakkathayam and
aliyasanthanam customs, respectively, in these regions.
There were three acts enacted particularly on Muslim
matriliny: Mappila Succession Act of 1918, Mappila Wills
Act of 1928, and Mappila Marumakkathayam Act of 1939.
The Act of 1939 sanctioned the partition of the joint family
property with the agreement of the majority of the members
of the family. It also took away the customary right of the
joint family head over the property and members. Prior to
this Nayar tharavadus, and Nayar matriliny had undergone
transformation. This is the backdrop of the article. Malabar
Marriage Report was passed in the year 1886; The Malabar
Act of 1898 and the Madras Marumakkathayam Act of
1933 were followed (see Arunima, 2003).
Having said this, in this article, we will concentrate on a
particular legislation, the passage of Mappila Succession
Act of 1918. While discussing the historical context of this
Act, we will look at the ways in which gender relations in
Malabar underwent radical transformations during 1910s.
We will also see how the interests of male junior members

of the Mappila matrilineal joint family on the joint family
property were expressed through the idioms of religion and
morality. In 1920s, matriliny was referred to as "un-
Islamic" in the discourses of the courts, reform movements,
and Mappila youngsters who received Western education.
These discourses on family practices emerged from
multiple sites like the court, the state, and orientalist texts. It
was also the time when ideas proliferated in Malabar
though print media. Books in English and Arabic were
translated into vernacular after the advent of the print
technology in South India. Christian missionaries as well as
local Islamic scholars invariably engaged with their content.
Hence, in the context of Malabar, we will see that there was
an advent of new forms of "religious truth." With reference
to Islam, there were new discussions on existing practices.
They always referred back to the contents of certain
religious texts (Razak, 2007). However, what one can see in
Malabar is how in response to these debates matrilineal
Mappila Muslims negotiated with any unilateral
construction of "Islam." At that particular time, matrilineal
practices were very widespread among Muslims, especially
among cosmopolitan Muslims of coastal areas of the Indian
Ocean. In response to the emerging debates, they tried to
"re-articulate" the matrilineal customs in the idioms of
"correct" ways of practicing Islam. This was to retain the
basic structure of matrilineal customs. For this purpose,
they modified many aspects of gender relations and equally
negotiated with religious practices that were in coming to
be in vogue those days. They also attempted to read many
of their customary practices in new ways to negotiate with
idioms of patriarchy and textuality. Yet, the gender
relations underwent a shift. This article looks how "re-
articulation of matriliny" resulted in the loss of power, and
authority for Mappila women in first decades of 20th
century in the coastal regions of Malabar.
Matriliny Among Muslims in Malabar,
Kerala
First, let us briefly discuss on the matrilineal practices
among Muslims in Malabar. The nomenclature "Mappila"
in general is used for Muslims of Malabar, Kerala (Koya
2004).1 Initially, it was used to denote a community born
through the encounter between Arab merchants in the
Indian Ocean and the local people. These Arab traders
dominated the merchantile activity in the Indian Ocean
before they lost out with the Dutch colonial endeavors
(Pearson, 2003). During the colonial time, the term became
associated with the local people. Then onward, the term
"Mappila" denotes a broader community consisting of
various heterogeneous populations that practice Islam. The
organization of family, kinship systems, and customs of
inheritance are different among Mappilas to such an extent
that Mappilas of interior southern Malabar follow
patrilineal kinship, whereas their Mappilas in the coastal
regions ranging from South Malabar to North Malabar, and
South Canara predominantly followed matrilineal descent
and inheritance or marumakkathayam (D'souza, 1978;
Logan, 1885/1951; 1885/1951a); Wigram, 1882;
Abdurahiman 2004).2 These differences in practices can be
understood in context of different phases of conversion to
Islam. Our focus is on the matrilineal Muslims of Malabar
who converted to Islam with the influence of Arab trading
merchants in the Indian Ocean. The similarities between of
Muslim customs and the Nayar matrilineal practices are
strikingly similar in term of kinship terms, and practices.
Behind this, there is a history of conversion, political
dynamics within small kingdoms, and trade in the Indian
ocean.
Matriliny among Mappilas (henceforth, Mappila
matriliny) is specific in their practice of matriliny and
matrilocality. Matriliny implied that relationships were
traced through the mother, and inheritance is traced through
women; while men of the household had rights to a share of
the family property only while living in it (cf. Arunima,
2003). Matrilocality implies that puthiyapla (husband)
would visit a Mappila woman at night, in similar way to the
practice in Lakshadweeps (Dube, 1969), or he would visit
her at day time or night in her ara (bridal chamber) without
permanently staying there (Gough, 1961, p. 415).
The fourth decade of the 20th century witnessed a great
churning in the history of matriliny in general, which is the
focus of our discussion. There were simultaneous changes in
the normative concept of family in the ambit of the court, and
in the minds of educated elites who were at the helm of
socio-religious reform efforts. A shared norm was established
as the "correct" and the "true" practice. The norm solidified
to become normative. The norm influenced the empirical
practices and led to structural changes. They set up what can
be called in Durkheim's (1964) terms as "dogmas."
To understand matrilineal customs, let us begin with
the discussion of the institution of tharavadu or
matrilineal joint family. A tharavadu consists of
individuals who claim descent from a common female
ancestor. This entity in 20th century consisted of a female,
her children, and her daughter's children. Mappila
tharavadus functioned as an exogamous community held
together by the relations of real or fictive kinship.
Members are related to each other through two ties called
mudhalsambandham and pulasambandham ties.
Pulasambandham implied the observance of common
rituals at the event of birth and death. The kin bound
through pulasambandham are called attaladakkam heirs or
the heirs who inherit the property at last in the absence of
immediate female heirs. Mudhalsambandham implied
common rights over property; and that consists of the
kindred community. First, women were central to the
inheritance in matrilineal families; and they did not sever
their affective and economic ties with their natal homes.
Second, children irrespective of sex belonged to the
mother's joint family. Third, women inherited the
matrilineal joint property (Ali, 1933).
Kottakkunnummal 3
As told in the beginning, there was a re-definition of
tharavadu authority in terms of gender and generation by
the early 20th century (Arunima, 2003, p. 56). As noted by
Arunima (2003) in the case of Nayars, tharavadu became a
corporate and impartible structure among Muslims as well.
Women's importance and active role in the various ways of
social reproduction, like in rituals, customary exchange of
cooked food between families, and the management of the
tharavadu was reduced to their role of sexual reproduction
(Arunima, 2003, p. 53). The responses regarding property
became the preserve of the karanavan--the male head of
the family (Arunima, 2003, p. 72). When tharavadu became
what Arunima (2003) called "a corporate unit" with
impartible property by early 20th century, it discredited the
individual properties of women. In the case of the Nayars,
individual properties of the women were mainly the land set
aside by lovers or husband for their maintenance and
normally passed in the female line (Arunima, 2003, p. 73).
Disputes Over Land and Judicial
Interventions in the Late 19th Century
We will discuss the Mappila Succession Act of 1918 and
look at the ways in which intervention of the judiciary had a
strong impact on marumakkathayam practices, especially to
those properties owned separately or exclusively by
women. Before going into some of the court decisions of
property, I will give a description of the ways in which
court dealt with a late 20th century invention for the
transfer of property among matrilineal communities. It is
called transfer by "will." The majority of the property
among matrilineal Muslims was joint family property. Both
men and women had right over the property and also for
maintenance out of that in their lifetime; while women only
inherited the property. However, individuals could acquire
private property of their own. Initial years women received
landed property as gifts to be owned individually at the time
of marriage. Later, men increasingly started to acquire
landed individual property. Resultantly, the dissolution of
the individual property became a matter of dispute.
According to the logic of matrilineal customs, the self-
acquired property also reverted to the matrilineal joint
property in the case of men being the owner, and to the
branch of the joint family in the case of women after their
death; and nobody could alienate the property by sale, gift,
or will (Ali, 1933; Kumari, 2003). Many individuals wanted
to transfer the ownership of property to their children and
wife after their death. One of the mechanisms for this was
carried out by employing the will.
The will implied the gifting of the property during the
owner's lifetime. Malabar Wills Act of 1898 enabled
individuals following matriliny to gift their property by way
of the will according to their wish (Kumari, 2003). The
legal back-up for the execution of the will was provided by
the Malabar Wills Act of 1898. It was general law for
Hindus as well as for Muslims. The history of "will" shows
the coming into being of the concept of self-acquired
property.
This in itself could have carried the seeds for the demand
for a law which enabled the dissolution of the property to
spouse and children (both male and female) of the owner
leading to a threat to the integration of the joint family.
However, the law per se did not cause a total ruin of the
joint family, because the gifted property was mainly used
for the formation of a new branch of matrilineal family
consisting of mother and her children. Yet, the increase in
private property gradually set up the male authority,
especially of the father. Colonial court failed to resolve the
disputes between male and female children. Over time, one
could see that the precepts of Anglo-Muhammadan law
gaining momentum against the customary practices of
matriliny. While the lower courts recognized the custom in
the judgments, the higher court had an easy resort in the
codified Anglo-Muhammadan law. The court had an
abstract idea of the "correct" Islamic familial practice. The
normative ideal of Anglo-Muhammadan law led to the
legislation of the Mappila Succession Act in 1918 (Kumari,
2003).3
Let us discuss some examples that demonstrate the
ambiguity that surfaced in the courts, and reveals the
interface of Anglo-Muhammadan law with matrilineal
customary norms in the late 19th century. In Pathumma
versus Abdulla Haji case, a patrilineal Mappila made a gift
to his wife. The wording of the will ensured that wife held
the property in the same way as he held it. Court ruled that
the property gifted would take the incidents of tharavadu
property and not as the private property of those who
received it (Kumari, 2003, p. 337) This decision was
repeated in Kunchacha versus Kutti Maami Hajee case in
1892 as well (Lakshmi 2012, p.50).23 In another case, the
second husband of a matrilineal woman gave some property
to her and his children by her. Husband wanted his children
and wife to form a tavazhi (branch of tharavadu), so as to
exclude children from the first husband. In the first
instance, the court agreed to this deed.4 However, in a
subsequent period, court held on Pathumma versus Abdulla
Haji case that a gift of the property to mother and children
does not enable mother and her children to form a separate
thavazhi.5 Moreover, the court held that she could not
establish a tavazhi by excluding some of her children, to the
inclusion of some; also that in the case of such a gift, the
receivers would become only as tenants in common and
each have absolute rights equal to private property. Court
stated that tavazhi or tharavadu as "corporate unit" could
not constitute out of one's own will (Kumari, 2003, p. 339).
In another case, court held that gift by complete transfer of
property would become puthravakasam property or the
property gifted by the husband to the wife.
The tharavadu as a "corporate unit" meant that it was
treated as a corporate, impartible, co-residential and
property owning structure that rendered the tharavadu into
a manageable and cohesive unit. Puthravakasam is a kind
4 SAGE Open
of property that a man gives a tavazhi (branch) consisting of
wife and children held jointly according to
Marumakkathayam law (Ali, 1933, p. 91). In other words,
husband's grant of property leads to the establishment of a
sub-branch. It is beyond doubt that there was a rule against
compulsory partition of the property and hence formation of
sub-branches was common. These judgments show shift in
the attitude of colonial courts toward joint family and how
various branches were formed leading to the disintegration
of joint family. The disintegration into branches
constituting a unit with wife and children followed the logic
matrilineal kinship, but it established the role of the
husband and his private property. They also illustrate the
disturbance in the early custom by which tharavadu
appropriated the private properties of men and women as
common property. The changes in the customs thus
established the authority of the father; he then had a great
influence in the determination of the structure of matrilineal
family. The court, due to its lack of knowledge of
customary rules, failed to understand and resolve the
disputes.
To elaborate on the ways in which the court dealt with
the category of "gifted property" in legal disputes, and it led
to the ruin of female rights more specifically, I will discuss
the case of Sthrisothu tharavadus or families of exclusive
female collective ownership and management of the
property. Some Mappila tharavadus were strisothu
tharavadus. The strisothu tharavadu have the eldest female
member as the karanavathi (head) of the tharavadu. The
female members exclusively own and manage the property.
Male members, however, had only the right to avail
expenses for maintenance. In other words, though both
male and female members have equal rights over property,
the later have exclusive rights of management over the
tharavadu property (Ali, 1933, p. 92).
In a dispute over what is called as the strisothu nature of
property, court held that a deed granted to the female
descendants alone could not find acceptance. In this
instance, a matrilineal man executed a deed of gift in favor
of his wife and three daughters under which they and their
female descendants could enjoy the properties hereditarily,
to the exclusion of males. Subsequently, the last surviving
daughter made a gift of the properties to her own female
descendants; and the gift was objected by the other female
members of the line through a suit as she excluded male
members. The court held that the exclusion of males was
invalid. The observation was that the property does not vest
with wife and daughters as joint tenants. The court added
that the property have the incidents of tharavadu property,
because males have the right of survivorship over
tharavadu property, and they cannot be excluded from
enjoying it (Kumari, 2003, pp. 335-336). In 1910, the court
validated the above-mentioned practices of customs and
held that the descendants of the property to the female line,
excluding males and prohibiting partition, belongs to the
class of gifts known as strisothu or henumule and the
intention of such a gift is to pass the property to a class of
females jointly belongs to a tavazhi (Ali, 1933, p. 93).
However, in a later dispute of the same nature, court held
that the institution of strisothu tharavadu is "unknown" to
marumakkathayam custom (Ali, 1933, p. 93). By and large,
strisothu became a non-existent institution by the third
decade of the 20th century. Even in the above-mentioned
variety of the matrilineal families, the male and female
members got equal rights in erstwhile strisothu tharavadus.
There was, however, an exception that only the eldest
female member had the right to manage the tharavadu, as
karanavathi (Ali, 1933, p. 92). In many of the strisothu
Mappila tharavadus in Malabar, such a right is reserved to
females by a family karar signed by all the adult members
of the tharavadu.6 Ali (1933) argues that the shifts in
strisothu explain the harmful intervention of judiciary to the
customary practices of Mappilas. Strisothu did not
contradict customary law of Malabar. Yet, court intervened
in the practices and invented new customs. According to
this institution, the eldest female had greatest authority and
rights whereas male had only right to maintenance (Ali,
1933).
In this way, the court was one of sites from which
discourse on a correct familial practice could proliferate.
The court, a secular institution, shared the similar notion of
ideal family and inheritance along with religious
interlocutors in that era. The court could not accept the fact
that Mappila women could exclusively hold property. For
the court as well as for educated modern Mappilas, the
customs posed a threat. Matriliny existed in the zone in
which everything "dangerous" of the "impure" past existed.
As shown in the case of strisothu taravadus, the judiciary
adhered to an abstract idea of what constituted natural sex
roles in the legal framework of Islam. The colonial state
constructed Hindus and Muslims as distinct and attempted
to employ different legal procedures. The underlying
assumptions were provided by the orientalist scholarship.7
By early 20th century, there could be no individual
property and the entire earnings belong to tharavadu by
custom in matrilineal law. Yet, self-acquired properties
other than tharavadu property were increasingly acquired by
the individuals. In customary marumakkathayam practice,
especially in North Malabar, the self-acquired property
devolved on to the tharavadu in the case of male. In the
case of female die without making a will, it goes to the
tavazhi. It would contribute and additional income to the
tharavadu or tavazhi (Ali 1933, p. 93). This was the
practice in a large majority of cases in the two northern
taluks of Chirakkal and Kottayam. And it was similar in
places like Badagara and Quilandy, also in North Malabar.
There was no uniformity in the norms of succession in the
interiors of North Malabar where Mappilas were minority:
while some families followed marumakkathayam custom
the other followed Muhammadan law (van der Veer, 1996,
p. 94). However, in South Malabar and Lakshadweep
islands, there was dual system of inheritance. The private
Kottakkunnummal 5
property of member of the tharavadu devolved according to
the Sharia line of inheritance. In Lakshadweep, private
property is tingazhcha swoth or Monday property that
differentiated from tharavadu property with the term Friday
property or velliazhcha property (Ali, 1933, p. 94;
Vijayakumar, 2006, p. 129). Monday property or
thinklazhcha property is divided according to the customary
Sharia law, while Friday property is impartible
(Vijayakumar, 2006, p. 129).
As seen above, in the case of strisothu family property,
the courts had considerable ambiguity regarding the
resolution of Mappila disputes. Lewis Moore (1905), who
dealt with the laws governing inheritance by the Mappilas
observed that those who follow marumakkathayam treated
the "self-acquisition" of a man as transferred to his wife
and children under the Muhammadan law in patrilineal
line (pp. 323-351). He also held that it was not unusual for
a father and sons to have community of property and the
property to be managed by the father, and after his death,
the eldest son. It can be argued that, this perception of
allowing the Muhammadan law for inheritance was a
product of longstanding debate. In 1851, the custom of
"double inheritance" went before the consideration of the
Privy Council. The council judged that it was not
sufficiently established.8 In 1855, a sudder court
questioned the prevalence of two laws of inheritance
prevailing in the same family and in 1861, Tellicherry
judge showed dissatisfaction over this law; he described it
as a "piebald system of descent" (Moore, 1905, p. 324).
Still two decisions in 1880 sanctioned the existence of
both forms of laws of inheritance in one family. In a case
in 1880, the issue was that a women belonging to a family
governed by a marumakkathayam law had married to a
man belonging to family governed by Muhammadan law;
and after his wife's death, the husband declined to return
the property given to his wife on the occasion of her
marriage by her tharavadu (Wigram, 1882, p. 153). The
lower court decided that the property to revert to
tharavadu and it therefore become unnecessary to divide
it; it would have come under Muhammadan law if the
property had been the self-acquisition of the wife
(Wigram, 1882). These developments are exemplary of
the transformations and continuities happened in
matriliny.
Transformations in the Structure of the
Matrilineal Joint Family
Gough (1961) in her ethnography on Mappilas observed
that there happened what was called "modern disintegration
of matrilineal descent groups." She observed that long-term
structural changes in the economy induced by the British
government led to the changes in the pattern of matrilineal
kinship. There were changes in technology and
communication; and introduction of cash cropping.
Arunima (2003) in her study of the Nayar matriliny in
Malabar observes the varying reasons ranging from the
legal re-definition of the family by the colonial court and
the state, to economic and ideological pressure in Malabar
during that period. She also underlines the interplay
between colonial land revenue policies and legal measures,
and cultural adaptation in response to colonial modernity in
the context of structural changes in the production relations.
Vijayakumar (2006) in the context of the transformation of
Muslims matrilineal customs in Lakshadweep islands,
India, argues that the interplay between the implanting of
mainland law in the island, establishment of legal
institutions, land reforms, and the emergence of the new
ideas of religious practices in the post-independent period,
along with the economic transformations lead to the
changes in customary law. In the case of Muslim matriliny
in Minangkabau, Indonesia, Abdullah (1985) looks at the
ways which in the legalistic textual interpretations of Islam
contradicted adat (customary practices) from 19th century
onward. He describes the ways in which the society
attempted to re-examine the inherent greatness of adat law
and to strengthen the validity of adat as a system of
conduct. He calls this process "Islamization" to refer to the
situation in which the customs were defended by the
practitioners, but the meaning of the practices underwent a
shift. Holy (1996) observes that disintegration in matrilineal
groups starts with the tendency for matrilineal groups to
breakdown to small groups composed of uterine siblings
and their immediate descents in the female line. He further
postulates that the changes in matriliny account for the
change in the descent, changes in the conceptualization of
the descent, and changes in the ways of the transmission of
the property.
With reference to the transformation of Muslim
matriliny in Colonial Malabar, we will look at the interplay
between the economic factors, ideological factors, legal
measures, and the state policies in the realm of the Muslim
family. As mentioned above, there were transformations in
the ownership of land among matrilineal Muslims. Advent
of individual ownership of land, along with the
transformation in the hitherto existing modes of landholding
by the tharavadu was visible.9 The interests over the
collective land of the matrilineal joint family were
expressed through an attack on the matrilineal practices
with religious undertone saying that it was "un-Islamic" in
nature. Young junior members were at the forefront of the
campaign against matriliny. The reference point for the
demand for legislations for the transformation of the
ownership of land was the Anglo-Muhammadan law and
the ideological attack on Nayar matrilineal customs by the
caste-reform movements in Kerala. Anglo-Muhammadan
law was the Islamic legal system formed in British India in
the 19th century. The law adapted the Sharia law into the
frame of modern English jurisprudence. Sayed Rashid
argues that the British courts relied upon the legal texts of
the distant past for the purpose of authentication, and also
that they ignored contemporary interpretations. Thus, the
6 SAGE Open
law was codified as a conservative law and rigid set of rules
(Rashid, 1998).
In fact, various discursive practices happened during the
period of c. 1910-1940 that could explain the context of the
debates that contributed to the transformations in
matrilineal family. There were rise of nationalist
sentiments, dissemination of colonial governance and
power and the rise of the abstract idea of the "individual."
These historical happenings presented Malabar with a new
spatial, and political imagination. Yet, the most out-
standing and overt discourse on Mappila matriliny
happened with reference to religion: From the beginning of
20th century, there was a sensibility that matriliny was "un-
Islamic" by nature. This peculiar form of religious
imagination, at least by the first half of the 20th century
gained similarities of Islamic imagination in North India in
terms of its quest for a political identity based on a notion
of the ummah, a religious notion that has acquired a
political denotation (Kandiyil, 1992; Razak, 2007). Prior to
this period, matrilineal tharavadu was a site of power, and a
realm of negotiations between men and women.
The relationship between matriliny and Islam lingered in
the limbo of ambiguity in the worldview of young Mappilas
from 1910 onward. They wanted to locate the system with
reference to what they understood as "correct" practices of
Islam. Hence, one of the central ideological motivation
behind the legislation was to abolish matrilineal customs
and bring in the "correct Islamic practices." The demand
also enhanced effort toward community formation based on
religious and political identity among Muslims in Malabar
(cf. Menon 2002). Now, we will look at the transformations
in the meaning of religion among Muslims.
Advent of New Debates on Islam in
Malabar
An idea of "true Islam" emerged in Malabar by the 20th
century. The debates on Islamic practices and traditions
invariably informed the texts during the period. The abstract
ideas of religious truth became pertinent in the realm of the
family; and the discussions on family were simultaneous
with the spread of Anglo-Muhammadan law as legal code.
One of the early instances of the expression of the idea of
"true" Islamic practice can be found in the Colonial reports
and narratives. C. A. Innes (1908), the author of Madras
District Gazetteers observed that Mappilas engage in
heretic and corrupt practices, though he felt that they were
"strong" observers of the religion. He observes that they
engaged in witchcraft despite "Quranic condemnation";
"canonize" Tangals (spiritual leaders or Sufis mainly
consist of Arab geneaology) and make shrines on their
tombs (called as Meukham, Jaram). He also observes that
the Mappila notion of jins and shaitans (evil powers)
correspond to the Hindu demons and were propitiated in the
same way; Mappilas use wooden figures in magic; and also
believe in the evil eye and its bad effects (Innes, 1908, p.
196); and the principal social ceremonies have similarities
with Hindu rituals. He draws shared cultural practices of
Mappilas as borrowings from Hindus, mainly those of
lower castes' ritual tying of tali (symbol of marriage), use
of music, tom-toms, and exchange of betals (tobacco) in
ceremonies. However, he also adds that there were certain
"orthodox sections" who refrain from all these things
(Innes, 1908). Barring the reference to Catholic beliefs like
"canonization," the author attributes the causality of
adulteration to the acceptance of Hindu customs in the
cultural fabric of Islam, and he is also harping on an
abstract idea of "the correct Islam."
This perspective or view has to be seen as a product
orientalist scholarship on Islam (van der Veer, 1996, p. 51).
There was a protestantization and therefore a greater
significance given to the text after the emergence of
translation and religious writings in the print and a
subsequent assimilation of these dialogues for the
articulation of the daily life practices (van der Veer, 1996,
p. 220). "The truth" lied in the text; believers have to study
religious texts to lead a proper moral and spiritual life (van
der Veer, 1996, p. 215). Anthropological and historical
understanding of Islam is useful for the analysis of the
interface between Islam, matriliny, and gender relations
among the Mappilas in Malabar. Talal Asad propounds the
idea of Islam as "a discursive tradition." The discursive
nature of Islam means that every where Islam is concerned
with defining what is allowable (halal) and what is not
(haram) (Asad, 1986; Lukens-Bull, 2007). Discursive
practice of religion according to him incorporates the
qualities of the specific events of speaking, commenting,
and reflecting on the texts (Asad, 1986, p. 7). In a historical
context, there can be divergent ways of talking about
religion. In the context of Malabar, one has to look at the
interplay between law, oriental texts, vernacular print,
public debates, socio-religious and caste reforms, public
speeches, songs, and transformation in the economy and the
development of state apparatus to look at the articulations
of Islam.
The new reading of the Islamic texts in the light of
colonial modernity set up new norms for the authentication
of religious belief and familial norms among Mappilas in
Malabar. Thus, power becomes central in the understanding
of the construction of religious piety and moral practices. In
the coming sections, we will discuss the re-articulation of
the Mappila matrilineal customs with reference to the
Anglo-Muhammadan law and the abstract idea of "the
correct Islam."
Encounter Between Muslim Matrilineal
Customs and Anglo-Muhammadan Law
and the Passage of the Act of 1918
Now, we will look at the social life of the encounter
between Muslim matrilineal customs and the Anglo-
Muhammadan law. We will focus on the event of the
Kottakkunnummal 7
legislation of Mappila Succession Act and the social
dynamics around the passage of the Act. One of the central
concerns of junior members of the matrilineal joint family,
who were in the forefront demanding legislation, was the
rights over property. They wanted to pass their self-
acquired property, which was a separate from the joint
family property to their spouse and children. As mentioned
above, in the beginning of the 20th century, even the self-
acquired property of individuals reverted to their matrilineal
property after their death; and thus became the part of the
collective property. Young men had interest in acquiring the
joint family property being a junior member and his wife's
property as the husband.
The first eruption of the demand for the abolition of
Mappila matrilineal customs of inheritance was with respect
to the conceptualization of the succession of the collectively
owned property by matrilineal joint family or tharavadu.
According to Anglo-Muhammadan law, there is no joint
family; thus, it was held that there was no provision for the
existence of matrilineal joint family property.10 As a result,
there was a worry about the mismatch between the
"Islamic" notion of the inheritance of property and the
existence of tharavadu property. Young, educated Mappilas
wanted bringing matrilineal inheritance in "accordance with
the spirit and teaching of Islam" to resolve this mismatch.
The second demand for abolition was explicitly in
response to the newly emerged demand for the changes in
the customary rules regarding the inheritance of privately
owned land according to the provisions of the Anglo-
Muhammadan law. Anglo-Muhammadan law recognized
individual property, while in matrilineal customs, the
individually owned property reverted to the tharavadu after
the death of the individual. In response to this, there was
growing demand for a legislation of an Act that legally set
up the Anglo-Muhammadan law of inheritance over
customary matrilineal customs. The Mappila Succession
Act was passed in the year of 1918. The Act marked a shift
in the conceptualization of inheritance of the property of
matrilineal Mappilas. The inheritance was conceptualized in
accordance with Anglo-Muhammadan law.
Mappilas Succession Act was enacted in the year of
1918. The central focus of the Act was a provision for the
inheritance of self-acquired property by the provisions of
Anglo-Muhammadan law. Muhammadan law enabled a
Muslim to succeed, to gift, and to own individual property.
The Succession Act of 1918 brought those properties of
which a Mappila who follow marumakkathayam or
aliyasanthanam law, and has not made any testamentary
disposition to devolve upon his heirs in the order and
according to the rules of Muhammadan law even if he dies
without making a clear will.
Now, we will look at the social life of the debates on
matriliny vis-a-vis Islam starting from the inception of the
idea that matriliny as system of familial organization need
to be abolished owing to its "un-Islamic" character. Second,
we will discuss the implication of the passage of the
Mappila Succession Act with reference to inheritance of
property. Third, we will see how 1920s become a liminal
period in which the gender relations among Mappilas were
re-defined in the idiom of male domination.
The Demand for the Succession Act c.
1914-1918
Male, educated members lead the demand for the passage
of the Succession law. They stressed that matriliny was
"un-Islamic." However, it can be seen that the junior
members expressed their vested interest to acquire the
property of matrilineal joint family in the idioms of
religion. In one of the first incidents among the demand for
the bill, "Mappila residents of Cannanore and its suburbs"
submitted a memorial to the collector. The letter explicitly
marked their quarrel on matrilineal inheritance in
juxtaposition to the legal perspective. The litigators had a
problem with the fact that Mappilas transferred their
property to the children of their sisters and not to their own
children as enjoined by the holy Quran11 and expounded by
the Sharia.12 They also cited the example of Mappilas of
South Malabar to argue that customs in North Malabar was
an aberration from the normal:
The Mappilas of South Malabar did not follow
Marumakkathayam customary law. Mappilas of South Malabar
were the brethren who "strictly follow Muhammadan law of
inheritance."13
The demand for the changes in the rules of inheritance of
the matrilineal property surfaced in front of the authorities
soon. In a letter dated December 18, 1914, the collector of
Malabar sought opinions from the Mappilas in the district
of Malabar. 13 The responses to the various provisions of the
Mappila Succession Bill, according to official record found
a "general" acceptance, especially in North Malabar and
South Canara. The report of the Tahsildar of Chirakkal
states that in meetings that held at 13 places had local Kazi
as president. In Cannanore, the number of people present in
the meeting was as high as 3,000.24 One of the statements
that conclude the outcome of the meetings can be quoted
here:
At some meetings, the Kazis and the learned maulavis14 who
addressed the meetings went so far as declaring that if any one
were to say that he does not want that his self-acquired
property should devolve according to the Muhammadan Law,
he would turn a kafir (infidel).15
This statement, however, exaggerates the acceptance of
the bill and under-represents the reaction against the bill.
For instance, Tahsildar of Kurumbranad, North Malabar,
reported that in many places in the taluk, the idea of
legislation found opposition from the common people. They
had the view that the provisions in the Succession Act were
8 SAGE Open
"in the least interest of the Mappila tharavadu and that it
could cut the very root of existing system of
marumakkathayam."16 More interestingly, even those who
agreed with the legislation did not want the abolition
matrilineal customs. While many of the Mappilas were
apprehensive about the repercussions of the bill, they were
ambivalent about the "un-Islamic character" of the customs.
Social Impacts of the Debates on Mappila
Succession Act
The debates on the bill on succession had a huge impact on
the customary practices of inheritance, and it did create a lot
of reactions from the society. The bill instilled fear among
Mappila because one of the provisions in the bill took away
the right to succeed the indisposed properties of a deceased
karanavan (the eldest male member of the joint family) by
the joint family, as the right would "invariably be contested
by his sons." They anticipated that it would become a
perennial source of litigation.25 Many even argued that the
Act was unnecessary because a Mappila already had
adequate time to gift their individual properties during their
lifetime by way of executing a will. In fact, the reality till
that period was such that Mappilas did not take much
advantage of provisions of Malabar Bill to pass ownership
of the property as gift to those heirs prescribed by the
Anglo-Muhammadan law by writing a will.17
In the official compilation of various "opinions
collected" from the selected people, some of them
apprehended that the Act posed a threat to the very
foundations of the matrilineal system. Thus, they opposed
the legislation of the Act. Some sections of the educated
males could only officially express it. In fact, nobody could
even imagine practically abolishing matriliny though many
anadiravans or the junior members of the tharavadu wished
so. It is worth to mention that, the Act left out those
properties that were jointly held; the acquisition by the
karanavan; and the property gifted by matrilineal father.
These properties devolved to the matrilineal joint property.
Furthermore, the option of "the gift" by will was used by
Mappilas to transfer the ownership of their private property
also to the matrilineal kin even after the passage of the
Mappila Succession Act in 1918. For doing this, Mappilas
used the provision in the Malabar Wills Act, which enabled
them to give away their property during their "lifetime."
Eventually, Malabar Succession Bill was passed in the
Madras Legislative Assembly. The Succession Act led to
the destruction of tharavadu-based economy because
tharavadu did not receive any additional property by way of
availing the private property of the male members; while
tharavadu had to give maintenance for more number of
members.18 The decline in trust or embeddedness granted
by the ties of affective relations further ruined the economic
stability of the tharavadu (see Granovetter, 1985).
Third, the Succession Act in essence asserted that the
father­son bond and the wife­husband bond were "natural."
This sensibility was new for Mappilas. This idea established
that the spouse and children become the normative heirs to
the self-acquired property of Mappilas. The era, thus,
witnessed the emergence of the "individual" who give or
receive property over and above the control of the
matrilineal joint family. However, the construction of the
individuality was highly gendered. Male individual
Mappilas as junior members of the family were more
"individual" than female members as sisters. Male
Mappilas acquired private property; attempted to pass them
by using Muhammadan law; and looked forward for
claiming entry into the public sphere as an "individual."
The individual invariably claimed to transgress the sphere
of the private. However, the claim could have been rootless
without the structural support of matrilineal joint family,
which still survived much longer. Family gave economic,
social, and cultural resources to imagine the "being" of a
modern Muslim individual. Now, we will look at the
survival of matriliny among Muslims of Malabar. One of
the central aspects of the negotiation of Muslims with
dominant discourse of family in 20th century was the re-
definition of the familial customs in the idioms of newly
emerged notions of the "correct Islam."
Religion, Law, and Family: Alteration of
the Mappila Matriliny in Malabar, c. 1910-
1928
The alteration of the Mappila matrilineal customs meant
that there was a re-conceptualization of the customs for the
purpose of defending them against the threat posed by the
new abstract idea of the "correct Islamic" practice of
inheritance (cf. Abdullah, 1985). The first process in the
alteration Mappila matrilineal customs of inheritance was
with respect to the conceptualization of the succession of
the collectively owned property by tharavadu.
According to Muhammadan law, there is no joint family;
thus, it was held that there was no provision for the
existence of a joint family property.19 As a result, there was
a worry about the mismatch between the "Islamic" notion
of the inheritance of property and the existence of joint
family property. As a solution to resolve the incompatibility
of matriliny with the Muhammadan law and to rescue the
division of joint family property, it was suggested that one
can bring in the customary practice of inheritance of
collective property in the female line in agreement with the
Muhammadan law. For that purpose, one had to find out
some provisions in the Islamic jurisprudence, which
allowed succession in the female line. As result of this
pursuit, it was agreed that the tharavadu property could
partake "the nature of properties known as `wakf.'"
The provision of the "wakf" or charity in practice there
was that of "wakf-alal-aulad" or charity in succession either
in male or female line. This provision was in accordance
with Islamic law, especially Shafi school of law that
allowed a person to endow one's properties to children or
Kottakkunnummal 9
relatives to enjoy in perpetuity in a particular line of
descent.20 This provision was known as private charity. The
provision also had the condition that the property could
potentially devolve to an institution of charity like mosque
in the absence of a female member in a family to inherit the
same. Thus, we can see that the Succession Act on
inheritance of collective joint family property did not
receive support from the society. Mappilas, especially
orthodox landowning sections of the Mappilas, could not
afford re-distribution of tharavadu property to individuals.
And by altering the meaning of the customs local people
defended the customs and it happened that "the tharavadu
property will become impartible and inalienable and the
whole system could be brought in accordance with . . .
religion."21 The alteration rescued the tharavadu house from
the vested interest of the male members who demanded
partition of the collective property (Shankaran, 1932).
The second process of alteration happened by the passage
of Mappila Succession Act of 1918. It was explicitly in
response to the newly emerged demand for the changes in the
customary rules regarding the inheritance of privately owned
land according to the provisions of the Anglo-Muhammadan
law. Anglo-Muhammadan law recognized individual
property; the Mappila Succession Bill stood for allowing the
same for the self-acquired property of matrilineal Mappilas.
The Act marked a shift in the conceptualization of
inheritance of the property of Mappilas.
The alteration in the meaning of the matriliny tended to
"clarify" the ambiguity around religious nature of the
practice. Let us elaborate on what it meant by the ambiguity
by giving a specific example. One of the early documents to
look at this factor is the letter in response to a suggestion
for the legislation of the Malabar Partition Bill of 1910,
written by Ahmed Ali Rajah of Cannanore to the district
court of Tellicherry on September 30, 1910. The matrilineal
joint family properties of the entire committees who
practice matriliny in Malabar came under the discretion of
the Partition Bill. Ali Rajah opposed the Bill due to its
reference to Mappila matrilineal tharavadu and its
suggestion for the partition of the tharavadu into branches.
According to him, the conceptual pre-suppositions in the
Bill violated the principles laid down in the Quran and the
Muhammadan law in their original form. However, his
letter also shows the difficulties of making any easy
argument as well:
Of course, I am bound to admit that marumakkathayam law of
inheritance observed by the Moplah Mahomedans of Malabar
is opposed to the teachings of Islam, but at the same time I beg
to point out that in the present days, no single Mapla
Mussalman leaves his self-acquisition to his nephews and
nieces to form a tavazhi or tharavadu.
He felt that a practical resolution to this confusion will
be to regard these properties as wakf properties; and hence
would not be "un-Islamic" in nature. Thus, the re-
conceptualization of matrilineal customs in accordance with
the principles of wakf in 1920s was a pragmatic solution to
take away the ambiguity regarding the Islamic sanction of
the customs. However, these debates with reference to
Islam and family were produced particularly in the
discursive field of South India. This re-definition was
central to formation of Muslims as political community.
The imagination of a modern political community called
"Mappila" community was found in concrete forms by the
third decade of the 20th century. Young Mappilas organized
meetings and public talks at various towns in Malabar.
They debated political, religious, and social issues in these
gatherings (Kandiyil, 1992). The reverberation of Khilafat
movement in 1920s coupled with the occurrence of the
biggest riot in 1921 caused havoc in Malabar due to
massive incidents of the state repression (Panikkar 1989).
The atrocities of the suppression forced many Mappilas to
flee and to live in exile; they had interface with the Muslims
of North India and other parts of South Asia (Razak, 2007).
Khilafat movement also engendered Mappilas to the fold of
"universal brotherhood"--an underlying assumption of
what is called "Pan-Islamism." For instance, associations
for socio-religious reform and the well-being of the
community were formed among the Mappila diaspora
located in the countries like Sri Lanka22 simultaneously
with the formation of youth associations in various part of
Malabar (see Kandiyil, 1992). Imagination of Mappila
community underscored the reference to a "correct Islamic
practice" and these sacred imaginations transgressed the
limitations of space and time (cf. Eliade, 1987) to claim
entry into ummah, the universal community of Muslims
throughout the world. The community formation surfaces
into the debates on matriliny, because, notion of family and
debates around women central those imaginations. For
social reformers, women were emblematic of the pride of
the community and family was the microcosm of the
community (cf. Chatterjee, 1999). It is, however, important
to see that the imagination of Mappila "community" and the
attack on matriliny calling them un-Islamic derived energy
from same discursive field of late 19th century Kerala
where matrilineal practices among Nayars (Arunima, 2003)
and Ezhavas of Travancore (Velayudhan, 1998) were
attacked as "non-Hindu" practices and were radically
transformed or ruined.
Contextualizing the Mappila Succession
Act in the Discourse on Gender and Islam
From Late 19th Century Onward
Matrilineal family inherited even the self-acquired properties
of individuals before the passage of the Succession Act of
1918. The Malabar Wills Act further restricted the possibility
of the transfer of property to daughters by putting limits on
the nature of the gift by way of making will. Finally, the
Mappila Marumakkathayam Act of 1939 was passed in the
Madras Legislative Assembly. This Act marked the decline
of the institution of "karanavan" (the male head) or
10 SAGE Open
"karanavathi" (the female head) in the matrilineal joint
family. While in the early 20th century, the family by
authority possessed all movable and immovable property. He
had right to manage or mortgage them in the interest of the
tharavadu and to lease Ottis--a contract to the tenants. Head
of the family maintained the expenses of the joint family
house, and distribute income for the maintenance of the
junior male members of the family called melchilav (pocket
money; Arunima, 2003, p. 52). One example is that of Beevi
of Arakkal family of Cannanore, where the eldest member
irrespective of sex became the family head. The Act
restricted the powers of the head. By the early 20th century,
male and female members of the family become co-owners
to the tharavadu property. karanavan or karanavathi had to
show the accounts of the expenses and income to the
members. There was also a decline in the ritual, spiritual, and
customary status of the family head. The alteration of the
matrilineal customs and the loss of affective relations
contributed to the subjugation women to their husband (Ali,
1933, pp. 57-61). However, structural re-location of women
did not surface in the discourse on Muslim matriliny until
1930s, despite the churning happened during the period of
1910-1928. The women were the central concern of the
debates only in 1930s, when Mappila men grew apprehensive
about the "protection" of women who were already alienated
from the system. By then, socio-religious reform movements
imagined men and women in the idioms of modern
individuality.
Conclusion
The collective ideas and norms lead to formation of law and
customs in society. And in turn, law influences the
constructions of collective ideals (Durkheim, 1964). The
interplay between law and society can lead us to the
exploration of the collective imaginations that set up
worldviews. In the historical context of Malabar, one can
observe that the imaginations in the realm of the religion
permeate to what is commonly understood to be the realm
of the secular, the court, and the state. In other words, the
boundary between what is generally understood as the
secular morality and the religious truth blur in the social
milieu, the state and the judiciary shares the norms and "the
truth" as if they also constitute a religion. The junior
member of the Mappila joint family expressed their interest
over the landed property of joint family using these idioms.
It was an easy strategy, as that historical era was witnessing
churning among all matrilineal communities in Kerala, and
there were transformations in the economy that helped them
to acquire private property. Yet, they were by and large
depended on the existing institutions of matrilineal kinship.
In that sense, only by using the idioms religion and
morality, they could severe the affective relationship and
challenge existing customary practices. However, the social
history of this era also shows how Mappila elders and
women retained matrilineal kinship structure and negotiated
with breakage of affective relations by using the provisions
in the customary practices, and moral economy sanctioned
by family and religion such as the institution of wakf and
the creation of branches through female line. The history of
the transformation of matriliny shows how Mappila
Muslims of Malabar negotiated with colonial legal
principles, and Islamic laws, and attempted to retain their
matrilineal familial customs. First, the legislations, and
directions of the courts, failed to impose transformation in
the familial practices. Second, the textual and legal notion
of Islam could not dictate the articulation of Mappila
rituals, beliefs, and customs in their daily life. It does not,
however, mean that the customary matrilineal practices and
gender relations seldom underwent transformations. There
were constant processes of re-articulations of the family, re-
construction of the role of women, and re-conceptualization
of religious concepts. The court, religious experts, and
common Mappilas always encountered one another in the
site of the family. Thus, the history of matriliny also tells us
about the changes in Mappila daily life in the context of
colonial modernity; as indeed, the ways in which Mappilas
negotiated with threats on their customary practices by way
of incorporation, alteration, and negation. Mappila matriliny
escaped radical transformations unlike Nayar matriliny in
Kerala. Mappilas re-created their customs by re-locating
those practices within the fabric of "correct" Islamic
practices.

1. The term is also spelt as Mappilla or Moplah in early records.
2. The Muslim community in contemporary Kerala does not exist
with these strictly delineated differences. The movement of
Kottakkunnummal 11
people became more feasible after the improvements in the
inland public transport facilities. In the case of the coastal
cosmopolitan town of Ponnani, a bridge constructed during
1950s made the interaction between the interior South Malabar
and the coast possible. The construction of the bridge enabled
marriage relations between matrilineal and patrilineal
Mappilas. Prior to that, people of Ponnani commuted through
the Arabian sea or Ponnani river and contracted relations with
coastal matrilineal Mappilas in Calicut, or Chavakkad
(Thrissur, Kerala).
