Injury death excesses in smokers: a 1990­95
United States national cohort study
B N Leistikow, D C Martin, S J Samuels
Abstract
Objectives--Assess injury death relative
risks (RR), dose-response, and attribut-
able fractions for current cigarette smok-
ers (smokers) in a recent representative
sample of the United States population
without and with adjustment for (a)
demographic and (b) additional behavio-
ral risk factors.
Setting--United States.
Methods--National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS) adult (ages 18+ years) inter-
viewees from 1990 or 1991 were followed
through 1995. Referents had never smoked
a total of 100 cigarettes. Relative risks
were estimated with Stata software's Cox
proportional hazard regressions, using
NHIS final weights and primary sampling
units. The resulting RR and published
data were used to estimate population
smoking attributable fractions of injury
deaths in the United States.
Results--The crude, age-race-gender ad-
justed, and fully (demographic plus edu-
cational attainment, marital status,
alcohol use level, and seat belt use)
adjusted RRs for injury death in smokers
were 1.86 (95% confidence interval (CI)
1.30 to 2.66), 1.60 (CI 1.12 to 2.29), and 1.42
(CI 0.99 to 2.05) respectively. Those RRs
correspond to United States injury death
smoking attributable fractions of 18%,
13%, and 9%, respectively. Those smoker/
injury death RRs each showed a signifi-
cant dose response relationship (p<0.030).
Smokers' unadjusted unintentional in-
jury, motor vehicle crash, and suicide RRs
were 1.87 (CI 1.22 to 2.86), 2.14 (CI 1.12 to
4.11), and 2.17 (CI 1.02 to 4.62), respec-
tively.
Conclusions--Smokers in the United
States have significant dose-response ex-
cesses of injury death, independent of age,
race, gender, alcohol use, seat belt use,
education, and marital status. This sup-
ports earlier studies suggesting that
smoking may be a leading contributor to
injuries and injury may be a leading
burden from smoking, both nationally and
globally.

Keywords: smoking; mortality; cohort
Together, injuries and tobacco illnesses ac-
count for about 30% of deaths in the United
States and nearly a fifth (in 1990) to a third (in
the year 2020) of the estimated global burden
of disease.1 Measures to reduce injuries and
smoking are needed.
Understanding the full contributions of
smoking to injuries may supply additional
means of reducing injury, and additional
reasons for reducing smoking. Smoking causes
risk factors for injury including fires, depressed
reflexes, incoordination, impaired fitness, and,
possibly, depressed moods.2­4 Smoking is dis-
proportionately common, and associated with
high injury risks in narcotics addicts.5 Addicts
may have been disproportionately omitted
from the employment or volunteer based
populations in whom smoking related injury
risks have previously been assessed.
Studies of smoking related injury risks lack
1990's data, nationally representative samples,
and adjustment for risk taking behaviors such
as non-use of seat belts.2 3 Therefore, we will
assess the prospective association between
smoking and injury death in the 1990s in a
nationally representative sample of Americans,
without and with adjustment for demographic
factors and behavioral risk factors.
Methods
United States National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS) adult (ages 18+) interviewees from
1990 and 1991 were followed up for vital status
through 1995 using the National Death Index
(NDI).6 The NHIS, NDI, and linkage methods
have been described in previous studies.7 8 This
provided an average of five years of virtually
complete9 follow up on a nationally representa-
tive cohort of Americans. The lack of seat belt
and alcohol use data precluded use of NHIS
data from years other than 1990 and 1991.
Participants were classified as never smokers
(fewer than 100 lifetime cigarettes), ex-
smokers, and current smokers (smokers), by
baseline self report. For smokers, cigarettes per
day were recorded into 1­14, 15­24, and 25+
cigarettes/day categories.
Injury deaths include International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) codes
from E800­E999. Injury deaths were further
categorized into unintentional injury (ICD-9
E800­E949), motor vehicle crash (ICD-9
E810­E825), suicides (ICD-9 E950­E959),
and homicides (ICD-9 E960­E969).
We adjusted for several injury risk factors.
Demographic risk factors included age (five
year age groups), race (white, black, or other),
and gender. Behavioral risk factors were
education (0­11, 12, 13­15, or 16+ (college
graduate or more) years), seat belt use (always,
sometimes, or never), marital status, body mass
index, and alcohol use (0, 0.01­4.9, 5.0­14.9,

13.4 g of alcohol/drink).
Stata software's Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was used to estimate relative
risks of injury death among current smokers.10
NHIS final weights and primary sampling units
were incorporated into the calculations. Sex
was stratified in the demographic and fully
adjusted calculations. The test for trend was
calculated using 0 cigarettes/day (never +
ex-smokers), 1­14 cigarettes/day, 15­24
cigarettes/day, and 25+ cigarettes/day.
The smoking attributable fraction of injury
death equals ((RR-1)*Prevalence)/
(1+((RR-1)*Prevalence)); RR = relative risk.
The estimated smoking prevalences were 70%
for the homeless11 12 and 24.7%13 for household
members.
Results
Compared with never and ex-smokers, smok-
ers were younger, less educated, less consistent
users of seat belts, more often divorced, and
consumed more alcohol (table 1). Compared
with never smokers, smokers' crude RR of
injury death was 1.86 (95% confidence inter-
val (CI) 1.30 to 2.66) (table 2). After
adjustment for sex, age, and race, the RR was
1.60 (CI 1.12 to 2.29). The fully adjusted
smoker injury RR was 1.42 (CI 0.99 to 2.05)
with a significant dose response trend
(p<0.030). The above crude, demographi-
cally, and fully adjusted RR correspond to
smoking attributable fractions for injury death
of 18%, 13%, and 9%, respectively, for the
estimated 99.8% of Americans who have
homes.14 The overall (homeless + housed)
American smoking attributable fractions are

the same as the above housed smoking attrib-
utable fractions, unless smoker injury death
RRs are higher for homeless (v housed)
Americans and/or there is a 13-fold higher
injury death risk averaged across the homeless
compared with the housed. Assuming the
homeless and housed have the same crude and
adjusted injury mortality RR, the smoking
attributable fractions of homeless injury
deaths are 38%, 30%, and 23%, respectively.
Table 2 shows a crude increased risk of death
among smokers for unintentional injury, motor
vehicle crashes (crashes), and suicide. In the
fully adjusted analysis smoker RRs of uninten-
tional injury, crash, and suicide were 1.56 (CI
1.01 to 2.41), 1.83 (CI 0.97 to 3.44), and 1.36
(CI 0.60 to 3.12), respectively.
Discussion
We find that in the early 1990s, smokers in the
United States had dose-response excesses of
injury death, independent of smokers' excesses
of divorce and heavy alcohol use and deficits of
education and seat belt use. Smokers also had
significantly raised unadjusted RRs of fatal
unintentional injury, crash, and suicide, though
the adjusted RR were not statistically signifi-
cant due to low numbers of cases studied, due
to lack of association, or confounding. These
associations are consistent with published sug-
gestive (p=0.10 to p<0.20) associations be-
tween smoking and injury, unintentional in-
jury, and suicide death seen in randomized trial
data.3
In this national sample, smokers' risks of
injury death are similar to the relatively high
RRs seen in Norwegian or Swedish general
population samples.2 15 16 Those injury risks are
modestly higher than smokers' injury, suicide,
or violence death RR seen in socioeconomi-
cally advantaged populations such as the
United States Cancer Prevention Study-I
(CPS-I) volunteers,17 British physicians, nurses
in the United States, or Northern California
Kaiser Permanente health examinees.2 It seems
possible that smoking confers a higher injury
death RR in poor or addicted5 people included
in general population samples. The NHIS may
underestimate the United States smoking/
injury RR since the NHIS is based on
households and thus omits homeless people
who may be very prone to smoking and
injury.18 19 Correctly estimating national and
global RR of injury caused by smoking is
important since each 0.25 added to the global
smoking attributable injury RR, means an
additional about 1% of the global burden of
disease is due to smoking.2
This study has strengths. Inference from this
study is strengthened by the multiple demo-
graphic and behavioral factors we adjusted for,
and the recent data representative of house-
holds of a large and diverse nation.
This study has weaknesses. A modest
number of injury deaths, and even lower num-
bers of suicide, unintentional, and homicide
deaths were available for study. Our methods
may substantially overestimate smoking's real
injury risks due to our lack of adjustment for
drug use, biochemically determined alcohol
use, binge or similarly risky patterns of alcohol
use, personality, and other possible explana-
tions for the smoking/injury association. How-
ever previously reviewed forensic,20 rand-
omized trial, challenge-rechallenge, animal,
and some cohort and cotwin control evidence
suggests a smoking/injury association is likely
to exist, independent of those factors.2 3 21
Alternatively, we may have substantially
underestimated United States smoking attrib-
utable injury risks. That could result from
omitting the homeless from our sample, count-
ing baseline smokers who quit during follow up
as smokers; adjusting for divorce and possible
eVects of nicotine addiction, and ignoring
smoking's roles in fires,22 massive explosions,23
crashes,24 and other threats to bystander never
smokers. Given the high levels of substance
abuse seen in the homeless,25 their smoking
injury death RR could be over 2.5, as was seen
in substance addicts.5
Additional research is merited. The various
smoking/injury associations should be assessed
in other nations, especially from Asia, Latin
America, and Africa, at other stages of the
tobacco epidemic. The smoking/injury associ-
ation may be assessed in the homeless and then
included in national estimates of smoking/
injury associations. The role of smoking's fires,
crashes, and stressors (illnesses from second-
hand smoke and smoking attributable bereave-
ments) in injuries in never smokers may be
assessed. Smoking involved crashes may be
studied in the same manner as alcohol involved
crashes.26 The contributions of smoking or
nicotine addiction to behavioral risk factors for
injury such as alcohol use,27 drug use,5 28 social
isolation,29 and inability to advance in school30
may be assessed. This would help assess
whether it is appropriate to adjust the smoking/
injury association for such possible eVects of
tobacco use.
Implications for prevention
In summary, there is a very substantial risk that
smoking is contributing to many injuries and
resulting costs in the United States and
globally. Taxes, cigarette pack graphic warn-
ings,31 and other methods of reducing smoking
may be highly cost eVective32 or possibly cost
saving20 33 ways of reducing injury. Further
studies and warnings of smoking's injury risks
are merited. Smokers, physicians, policy mak-
ers, taxpayers, and non-smoking bystanders
may benefit from warnings about the risks of
injury associated with smoking.
