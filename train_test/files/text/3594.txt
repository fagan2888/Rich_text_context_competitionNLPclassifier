Introduction
In her seminal study for the United Nations, "The Impact of
Armed Conflict on Children," Graça Machel (United Nations,
1996) drew international attention to the devastating physical,
psychological, social, and cultural effects of war on the lives
of children. In the same year, United Nations Children's
Fund's (UNICEF; 1996) "State of the World's Children"
report estimated that two million children were killed and six
million children were injured or disabled in conflicts in the
decade previous to its publication. Although we have since
advanced our understanding of the experiences of children
affected by war, they continue to face significant trauma dur-
ing and after war. Both a10-year strategic review of the
Machel study (UNICEF, 2009) and the recent 2013 "Annual
Report on Children and Armed Conflict" (United Nations,
2014) identify ongoing abuses of children in armed conflict,
including sexual assault, abduction, forced participation in
conflict, attacks on schools, and deprivation of food, basic
health care and education. Such experiences fall within cur-
rent understandings of traumatizing events which include
actual or threatened events, including death, serious injury, or
sexual violence though direct experience, witnessing, hearing
about a loved one, or repeated extreme exposure to details
(American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). These
reports underscore the fact that, globally, almost two decades
later, many children continue to experience massive physical
and psychological threats to their well-being.
Despite this dismal picture, not all children exposed to
mass violence and trauma develop psychopathology.
Multiple individual, social, and contextual factors are recog-
nized as influencing a child's psychosocial response to trau-
matic experiences. These include the nature and timing of the
experience, social preparation, personality, coping skills,
social and familial support, and secondary stressors. This
recognition has resulted in calls to examine trauma and psy-
chosocial adaptation of war-affected children from ecologi-
cal perspectives, that is, from the vantage of children's
developmental level and life contexts (Boothby, 2008;
Gabriano & Kostenly, 1996; Walton, Nuttall, & Nuttall.,
1997), larger socio-cultural context (Rousseau, Drapeau, &
Corin, 1997; Wessells, 1999), individual and social risk and
protective factors (Betancourt & Khan, 2008), and time and
context-dependent variables (Attanayake et al., 2009; Tol,
Song, & Jordans, 2013). However, currently, we do not have

Applying the ADAPT Psychosocial
Model to War-Affected Children
and Adolescents
Sophie Yohani1
Abstract
Multiple individual, social, and environmental factors have long been recognized as influencing a child's response to traumatic
experiences. However, there remain few socio-ecological frameworks to guide researchers and practitioners working with
war-affected children. This article examines Silove's psychosocial model of adaptation and development after trauma and
persecution (ADAPT model) in relation to war-affected children. The utility of the model is explored by examining whether
the systems of safety, attachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning described in the ADAPT model are represented
in a narrative review of research from the last 20 years on the experiences of war-affected children and adolescents. Results
suggest that research with war-affected children has covered all five psychosocial pillars in the model, but with overemphasis on
the safety, followed by the attachment, domains. This review highlights that need for research and psychosocial interventions
that focus on adaptation of war-affected children's identity development, sense of justice, and meaning systems.

a unifying ecological framework to guide psychosocial
research and practice with children in conflict, post-conflict,
and resettlement settings. Although some studies refer to
Bronfenbrenner's (1979) socio-ecological framework (e.g.,
see Betancourt & Khan, 2008; Saile, Ertl, Neuner, & Catani,
2014; Yohani & Larsen, 2009), it was not developed for
childhood trauma. Similarly, research that utilizes develop-
mental psychopathology models (e.g., see Pynoos, Steinberg,
& Piacentini, 1999) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM)/International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) classification systems do not adequately
address collective or mass trauma.
One model that shows promise as a general guide or meta-
model in the field of refugee mental health is the adaptation
and development after trauma and persecution (ADAPT)
model. With its focus on how individuals and society adjust
to new information and experiences (i.e., adaptation), this
psychosocial model provides an explanation for both resil-
ient and psychopathological responses to traumatic events. It
is built on the idea that stability at the individual psychic and
social levels interact and reflect each other through supports
from key psychosocial pillars represented in institutions,
practices, and culture (Silove, 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006). In
the aftermath of war trauma, individuals and communities
actively defend and maintain these systems of psychosocial
stability, which include safety, bonds and attachment, justice,
identity and roles, and existential meaning. Individual and
collective mental health disorders reflect a failure to adapt
both individually (i.e. biologically) and in the psychosocial
environment in the aftermath following trauma. Although
this model has been presented with adults, it may have poten-
tial for application to children.
This review article examines whether the systems found in
the ADAPT model (Silove, 2000) are represented in the body
of knowledge on the psychosocial experiences and needs of
war-affected children and adolescents through an analysis of
research literature from the last 20 years. The goals are to
explore whether this framework applies to a pediatric popula-
tion and to identify patterns and gaps in the scientific litera-
ture as reflected in the five psychosocial domains of safety,
attachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning. The
model's broad perspective on psychotrauma has potential to
inform psychosocial practice with children affected by mass
violence. Using a narrative review approach, searches were
conducted in major database (e.g., PubMed, medline, pscy-
INFO, PILOTS) using key words covering the five domains
in the model (i.e., safety, attachment, justice, identity, and
meaning) and terms relating to war, conflict, trauma, resil-
ience, and adaptation in children ages 5 to 18 years in con-
flict, post-conflict, and resettlement settings. A total of 118
representative journal articles and book chapters covering
qualitative and quantitative studies were selected and a
research assistant worked with the author to analyze and cat-
egorize information into the five domains described. A sec-
ond research assistant served as an external auditor, and the
final categories were determined through consensus. After a
brief explanation of the model, each domain is illustrated by
using a case incident, examples of major research findings
relating to the domain, and, consistent with the model, an
analysis of both adaptive and maladaptive responses to war-
trauma. Finally, avenues for further research, practice, and
policy implications are presented.
The ADAPT Psychosocial Model
The ADAPT model is an integrative psychosocial frame-
work for connecting the multiple issues, stressors, and
resources facing war-affected individuals (see Silove, 1999,
2000, 2005, 2006). Silove (1999) proposed five universal
adaptive systems believed to subsume the functions of
safety, bonds and attachment, identity and roles, justice, and
existential meaning in all societies. Under normal circum-
stances, these systems are understood to have evolved to
promote personal and social homeostasis between individu-
als and their community. Although these systems are
described separately, they are believed to interact within and
between individuals in a community in "a synergistic and
mutually supportive way" (Silove, 2005, p. 41). As such,
these systems evolve dynamically as different stressors face
individuals and their community, creating differing needs
and warranting different responses.
The hypothesis underpinning the ADAPT model is that
extreme trauma fundamentally challenges one or more of
these major adaptive systems which sustain "a state of psy-
chosocial equilibrium in individuals and their communities"
(Silove, 1999, p. 203). Focusing on adaptive mechanisms for
individuals and communities is built upon several prior
understandings. First, as a highly adaptable species, human
beings likely share universal methods of survival in the face
of adversity, even though cultural and contextual differences
may shape the expression of these adaptive mechanisms
(Silove, 2000). Second, these universal adaptive systems
have reciprocal representations in both psychobiological and
socio-cultural structures created to foster the group's survival
and growth. Underlying Silove's model is the belief that
human reactions to trauma are driven by an evolutionary need
for survival and psychosocial development that mobilize "the
inherent capacities of individuals and groups to repair their
own institutions, given favourable support and judicious
external assistance" (Silove, 2000, p. 341). Reemphasizing
individual and community contributions to the adaptation
process following trauma underscores the capacity communi-
ties have to actively adapt following adverse situations. In
this sense, the ADAPT model can be situated within resil-
ience literature (Rutter, 2003) but with more emphasis on
individual and collective experiences after mass violence.
Silove's five adaptive systems are outlined below. Each of
the five sections begins with a case incident illustrating the
pertinent issues related to that system. These cases are drawn
from the author's clinical experience and critical incidents
Yohani 3
collected during research examining cultural brokers and
mental health practitioners' roles in facilitating refugee chil-
dren's adaptation in resettlement countries (Brar-Josan &
Yohani, 2014; Yohani, 2013). It should be noted that case
incidents sometimes involve issues related to more than one
system, as an individual's experience might involve a threat
to multiple systems simultaneously.
Safety
Unbridled attacks on civilians and rural communities have
provoked mass exoduses and the displacement of entire
populations who flee conflict in search of elusive sanctuaries
within and outside their national borders. Among these uprooted
millions, it is estimated that 80 per cent are children and women.
(United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 10)
While living in Afghanistan during the civil war, 14-year old
twins brothers witnessed the murder of their sister and her
husband. One boy was also stabbed during the altercation.
After resettling in Canada, both children saw a psychologist
to address symptoms of trauma. Initially, both children were
doing well, but then the boy who had been stabbed began
using drugs and engaging in criminal activity. It was later
discovered that he was being bullied while in school.
Although he appeared adjusted to most people, he had devel-
oped a strong sense of paranoia and was coping by using
substances. The boy started to respond to treatment after the
bullying was addressed in school.
Description.Defining the absence of safety, Silove (2000)
described events that threaten the survival or integrity of an
individual or those close to the victim. In war, infringement
on the safety system often involves experiencing traumatic
events. Examining threat-based definitions, safety can be
broadly outlined as the relative assurance of the physical,
psychological, and spiritual integrity of individuals and their
community. Attending to issues of safety and security is par-
amount for adaptation and survival (Silove, 2005).
Examining the research literature on war-affected children
and adolescents, the safety system appears to draw the most
interest from researchers. As seen in the case vignette, both
directly witnessing violence (e.g., see Dyregrov, Gjestad, &
Raundalen, 2002; Henley & Robinson, 2011; Heptinstall,
Sethna, &Taylor, 2004; Husain et al., 1998; Pacione, Measham,
& Rousseau, 2013; Thabet & Vostanis, 2000) and personally
experiencing violence (e.g., see Allwood, Bell-Dolan, &
Husain, 2002; Derluyn, Broekaert, Schuyten, & Temmerman,
2004; Goldstein, Wampler, & Wise, 1997; Mirza, 2006;
Pacione et al., 2013; Papageorgiou et al., 1999; Qouta,
Punamäki, & El-Sarraj, 2003; Schaal & Elbert, 2006; Servan-
Schreiber, Le Lin, & Birmaher, 1998) are common occurrences
reported by war-affected children and their parents. Violence
includes events like physical or sexual assault, shootings, and
bombings. Indirect exposure to violence, through television or
radio broadcasts, is another source of trauma (e.g., see Hadi &
Llabre, 1998; Macksoud & Aber, 1996; Thabet, Ibraheem,
Shivram, Winter, & Vostanis, 2009). Children and adolescents
are also involved in the hostilities (e.g., see Amone-P'Olak,
2005; Bayer, Klasen, & Adam, 2007; Betancourt, Borisova,
et al., 2013; Derluyn et al., 2004; Macksoud & Aber, 1996;
Robinson, 2013; Sack, Him, & Dickason, 1999), either training
with armed forces, patrolling, or being forced to commit acts of
violence or subterfuge. In some conflicts, girls are abducted by
rebel forces and forced into marriage or other types of sexual
abuse as reported among girls abducted in Northern Uganda
(Amone-P'Olak, 2005). Resulting from these experiences,
many children in these studies described fearing further acts of
violence (e.g., seeAllwood et al., 2002;Al-Mashat,Amundson,
Buchanan, & Westwood, 2006; Dyregrov, Gupta, Gjestad, &
Mukanoheli, 2000; Goldstein et al., 1997; Hadi & Llabre,
1998; McFarlane, Kaplan, & Lawrence, 2011; Servan-
Schreiber et al., 1998; Thabet, Abed, & Vostanis, 2002; Thabet
& Vostanis, 2000).
To escape the dangers of war, children and their families
may leave their homes, either becoming internally displaced
within their own countries or by moving to other, safer coun-
tries (e.g., see Adam & van Essen, 2004; Gupta & Zimmer,
2008; Kuterovac-Jagodic, 2003; Robinson, 2013; Sack et al.,
1999). However, relocation poses its own dangers, including
starvation, assault, and exposure to further violence. In a study
of Tibetan refugees living in India (Servan-Schreiber et al.,
1998), one child lost half of her traveling companions in an
avalanche, while another was captured and imprisoned for a
month. In another study by Bates, Luster, Johnson, and Rana
(2013), Sudanese youth who were forced to relocate to
Ethiopia witnessed the death of more than half of their peers.
Displacement has been found to have a negative impact on
children's well-being, with mothers of displaced Croatian
children indicating a substantial increase in a variety of physi-
cal, behavioral, and emotional symptoms, as well as more con-
centration difficulties (Ajdukovic & Ajdukovic, 1998). Even
for children who have relocated to a safe country, post-migra-
tion experiences have been linked with children's psychologi-
cal symptoms as noted in the case vignette (Heptinstall et al.,
2004; Pacione et al., 2013). In a longitudinal study of adoles-
cent Middle Eastern refugees residing in Denmark, post-
migration adaptation and stressors (such as discrimination)
were stronger predictors of psychological problems than pre-
migration trauma (Montgomery, 2008). This demonstrates the
significance of the refugee experience post-migration.
Adaptive responses. Responses to trauma need to be viewed
in the context of their circumstances. After experiencing war
violence, a period of arousal, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance
of stimuli associated with the trauma can be considered
adaptive behavior, especially if danger may reoccur (Silove,
1998). For example, the previous case illustrated how hyper-
vigilant behavior in a youth alerted the presence of new
threats to safety in his resettlement environment. Similarly,
4 SAGE Open
in a study of internally displaced Bosnians living in the midst
of war (Goldstein et al., 1997), an increased startle reflex and
fears of going outside, common indicators of post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), were actually considered protective
for children.
Responding adaptively to war experiences may also
involve children remaining at or returning to their previous
level of functioning before the trauma. Standardized mea-
sures of intelligence are one potential way to assess changes
in children's cognitive functioning, over time. In a study of
Kuwaiti children using a translated version of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R; Hadi &
Llabre, 1998), mean changes in children's WISC­R scores
from pre-crisis to post-crisis were actually positive. While
this change was partially attributed to practice effects, it may
also be a sign of resiliency following trauma. Likewise, a
decrease in psychological symptoms of trauma among young
Middle Eastern refugees resettled in Denmark (Montgomery,
2010) may be viewed as an indicator of resiliency.
By managing day-to-day stressors and tasks, children can
also show how they can adapt following trauma. For a group
of Cambodian refugees living in America (Sack et al., 1999),
almost all were able to carry out daily responsibilities, such
as employment or schooling, despite their previous traumatic
experiences.
In a study of Iraqi children following war, children dis-
played a tough bravado and detached emotionality, which
appeared to increase the children's sense of strength when
feeling vulnerable (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Toughness was
seen as a good characteristic in this context.
Maladaptive responses. Intense emotions of anger, grief, sad-
ness, and fear are expected in the face of the tragedy and
destruction caused by war. However, when these feelings
and behaviors persist, they can interfere with daily function-
ing. Reported feelings of sadness or depression (e.g., see
Ajdukovic & Ajdukovic, 1998; Betancourt, Newnham, et al.,
2012; Dyregrov et al., 2002; Heptinstall et al., 2004; McFar-
lane et al., 2011; Paardekooper, de Jong, & Hermanns, 1999;
Sezibera, Van Broeck, & Philippot, 2009; Thabet, Abed, &
Vostanis, 2004) and anxiety (e.g., see Allwood et al., 2002;
Goldstein et al., 1997; Hadi & Llabre, 1998; Mollica, Poole,
Son, Murray, & Tor, 1997; Papageorgiou et al., 1999;
Punamäki, 1996; Thabet, Tawahina, El-Sarraj, & Vostanis,
2008; Werner, 2012) are common in studies of children
exposed to war. While these feelings are understandable,
their strength and pervasiveness may interfere with chil-
dren's ability to heal and develop following trauma.
From the perspective of the ADAPT model, PTSD-related
symptoms of arousal and hyper-vigilance can be protective
in dangerous environments (Silove, 1998) but can signifi-
cantly interfere with normal functioning once children enter
a safer environment. Symptoms of PTSD are common in
studies of war-affected children and adolescents (e.g., see
Attanayake et al., 2009; Betancourt, Newnham, et al., 2012;
Elklit, Østergård Kjær, Lasgaard, & Palic, 2012; Husain
et al., 1998; Kia-Keating & Ellis, 2007; Laor et al., 1997;
Macksoud &Aber, 1996; McMullen, O'Callaghan, Richards,
Eakin, & Rafferty, 2012; Mirza, 2006; Neugebauer et al.,
2009; Schaal & Elbert, 2006; Sezibera et al., 2009; Werner,
2012), with severity of post-traumatic symptoms ranging
from mild to severe. Several studies report that the severity
of children's post-traumatic symptoms is linked to the
amount of violent exposure children experienced (Heptinstall
et al., 2004; Lavi, Green, & Dekel, 2013; Neugebauer et al.,
2009; Schaal & Elbert, 2006; Solomon & Lavi, 2005).
Among refugee children living in London with their fami-
lies, a correlation was also found between the number of
post-migration stressors (e.g., financial difficulties, insecure
asylum status, language problems) and children's PTSD and
depression scores (Heptinstall et al., 2004). In particular,
Heptinstall et al. found that experiencing the violent death of
a family member and insecure asylum status were associated
with higher PTSD scores. Insecure asylum status and severe
financial difficulties were associated with higher depression
scores (Heptinstall et al., 2004).
Retaining post-traumatic symptoms in a safe environment
is a maladaptive, yet common, response for children exposed
to war (Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg, 1997; Sack et al.,
1999). Prevalence and severity of PTSD and depression were
measured in a 12-year longitudinal study of Cambodian refu-
gee adolescents living in America (Kinzie, Sack, Angell,
Manson, & Rath, 1986; Sack, Clarke, & Him, 1993; Sack
et al., 1999). Four years after leaving Cambodia, 50% of 46
students exhibited PTSD (Kinzie et al., 1986) and twelve
years later, 35% of 31 students met criteria for PTSD (Sack
et al., 1999). In a study by Betancourt, Newnham, et al.
(2012), 30.36% of a sample of 60 refugee children showed
PTSD symptoms even after resettlement. Bronstein,
Montgomery, and Dobrowolski (2012) found similar results
in a case of Afghan unaccompanied refugee minors with 34%
reporting PTSD symptoms, post-resettlement. According to
the ADAPT model, these symptoms are maladaptive because
they persisted for a long period of time and disrupted the reg-
ular functioning of these individuals. In a study of Iraqi chil-
dren following the Gulf War, children's post-traumatic
symptoms had reduced 2 years after the war (Dyregrov et al.,
2002). However, the overall scores remained high leading to
conclusions that children's post-traumatic "symptoms persist,
with somewhat diminished intensity over time" (Dyregrov
et al., 2002, p. 59). Ten years after the 1994 genocide against
the Tutsi in Rwanda, many Rwandan youth living in orphan-
ages and youth-headed households who had been exposed to
extreme levels of violence were still significantly distressed,
with 44% meeting criteria for PTSD (Schaal & Elbert, 2006).
Conversely, Punamäki, Qouta, and El-Sarraj (2001) reported
a significant decrease in Palestinian children's neurotic symp-
toms 3 years following political violence, especially among
those children exposed to the most traumatic events, indicat-
ing that some symptoms may decline over time.

The safety system and its relationship to PTSD tend to
attract the majority of researcher attention. However, several
other maladaptive responses are potentially linked with
safety violations. Psychosomatic complaints (McFarlane
et al., 2011; Paardekooper et al., 1999; Sezibera et al., 2009),
guilt (Goldstein et al., 1997; McFarlane et al., 2011), neuroti-
cism (Punamäki et al., 2001), underreporting of post-trau-
matic symptoms due to fear of stigma (Anstiss & Ziaian,
2010; Colucci, Minas, Szwarc, Paxton, & Guerra, 2012;
Servan-Schreiber et al., 1998; Thabet & Vostanis, 2000), and
developing an external locus of control (Kuterovac-Jagodic,
2003) are also described in groups of children following war-
trauma. In total, these maladaptive responses likely contrib-
ute to adjustment difficulties for children and adolescents as
they seek to begin new lives following war.
Bonds and Attachment
Children seek protection in networks of social support, but these
have been undermined by new political and economic realities.
Conflict and violent social change have affected social welfare
networks between families and communities. Rapid urbanization
and the spread of market-based values have also helped erode
systems of support that were once based on the extended family.
(United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 9)
A 15-year old Somali girl was having relationship problems
with her father while living in Canada. Before migrating, the
girl and her family lived in a refugee camp in Kenya. To sup-
port the family, the girl's father travelled to an urban area to
make some money, during which time the girl's mother died.
The girl had difficulty coping with her mother's death and
considered it her father's fault. She felt that if her father had
done more and remained close to the family, her mother
would still be alive. Over time, the relationship between the
girl and her father deteriorated, and she left home and moved
in with a group of peers. The girl's attendance at school was
poor so a community cultural broker arranged a meeting
with the girl and her father. While initially challenging, the
relationship between father and daughter improved slowly
with the assistance of community cultural supports and grief
counselling for both father and daughter.
Description.Attachment is a bond based on the need for
safety, protection, and comfort (Prior & Glaser, 2006) that
begins in infancy between a child and their caregiver(s)
(Bowlby, 1969). This attachment need is paramount in child-
hood, when individuals are the most vulnerable. For children
and adolescents facing war-trauma, this need for protection
and comfort is highly salient. Research in Uganda (Bowlby,
1969), Kenya (Kermoian & Leiderman, 1986), Mali (True,
Pisani, & Oumar, 2001), Israel (Fox, 1977), Nigeria (Marvin,
Van Devender, Iwanaga, LeVine, & LeVine, 1977), Botswana
(van Ijzendoorn & Sagi, 1999), and Zambia (Morelli & Tron-
ick, 1991) supports the premise that attachment theory is
applicable across cultures (Prior & Glaser, 2006).
As illustrated in the case vignette, one of the most devas-
tating disruptions caused by violence, displacement, and
other war-related traumas is the impact on the survivors'
interpersonal bonds (Silove, 1999). Separations and losses
can be either actual or symbolic. For example, a child may be
separated from a parent while fleeing a war-ravaged area or
lose a favorite toy which represents her comforting feelings
of home. As a symbol of familiarity and intimacy, the loss of
a home has a deeply personal impact on children (Klingman,
2002a). In the surveyed literature, war-affected children and
adolescents frequently reported attachment-related threats,
including witnessing violence against family or friends (e.g.,
see Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg, 1997; Ellis, MacDonald,
Lincoln, & Cabral, 2008; Macksoud & Aber, 1996; McBrien
& Day, 2012; Qouta et al., 2003; Schaal & Elbert, 2006),
separations from caregivers (Amone-P'Olak, 2005; Bates
et al., 2013; Derluyn et al., 2004; Durà-Vilà, Klasen,
Makatini, Rahimi, & Hodes, 2013; Heptinstall et al., 2004;
Hilker, 2009; Kia-Keating & Ellis, 2007; Kuterovac-Jagodic,
2003; Mirza, 2006; Papageorgiou et al., 1999), damaged
community supports (Dyregrov et al., 2000), loss of close
friends (Dyregrov et al., 2002), and a lack of social support
(Bates et al., 2005; Paardekooper et al., 1999; Punamäki,
1996). Even after conflict has ceased, children may continue
to worry about attachment-related threats. For example, 2
years after the Gulf War, more than 80% of Iraqi children
reported fear of losing their family sometimes or always
(Dyregrov et al., 2002). Examining the impact of separation
from caregivers, Klingman (2002a, 2002b) found that chil-
dren experienced greater distress from separations than from
witnessing death, destruction, injury, or bombings.
Lacking a parent or caregiver may place children at
greater risk for psychological difficulties. A study by
Derluyn, Mels, and Broekaert (2009) found that separated
refugee youth have an increased risk of facing multiple trau-
matic incidences, along with an increased risk for developing
mental health problems. In a study of unaccompanied refu-
gee minors seeking asylum in Norway (Batista Pinto Wiese
& Burhorst, 2007), unaccompanied children were more
likely to experience regulation difficulties, somatic com-
plaints, depressed feelings, and hallucinations or delusions
than children with family members. Similarly, in the United
Kingdom, higher levels of psychological distress was
observed in recently arrived young refugees, who had also
experienced separation from immediate family (Durà-Vilà
et al., 2013). As children's ability to self-regulate draws
greatly from their caretaker's emotional state, it seems likely
that unaccompanied minors run a greater risk of mental
health problems following trauma exposure (Huemer et al.,
2009; Loughry & Flouri, 2001; Lustig et al., 2004; Sourander,
1998). Similarly, psychiatric symptoms of PTSD and depres-
sion were more common and severe in groups of Cambodian
refugees who did not live with a family member when they
moved to America (Kinzie et al., 1986). Seglem, Oppedal,
and Raeder (2011) found that unaccompanied refugee minors

have elevated levels of depressive symptoms even after
resettlement. However, unaccompanied minors also experi-
enced, on average, more traumatic events than children liv-
ing with their families (Batista Pinto Wiese & Burhorst,
2007), highlighting the increased danger for children who
are separated from their caregivers. A literature review by
Huemer et al. (2009) concluded that being separated from
family greatly increased refugee adolescents likelihood of
experiencing traumatic events.
Youth-headed households are another outcome of war and
the loss of caregivers. For example, many children lost their
parents during the 1994 genocide against Tutsi of Rwanda
and/or subsequently from AIDS. As a result, it was estimated
that 10% of households in Rwanda were headed by children a
decade after the war (Mirza, 2006). Children in youth-headed
households were more "susceptible to disease, exploitation,
poverty, inability to attend school, and displacement from
their homes" (Mirza, 2006, p. 179). In addition, these youth
often felt marginalized and unsupported by their community
(Mirza, 2006). Another study found that Rwandan youth liv-
ing in child-headed households were more likely to report
PTSD symptoms than youth living in an orphanage (Schaal &
Elbert, 2006). These studies give emphasis to the psychologi-
cal and social sequel of threats to children's attachment sys-
tems in the context of war.
In families, children are not the only members exposed to
the effects of war. Caregivers may also be traumatized by
violence, injustice, and instability (Klingman, 2006; Saile
et al., 2014). Reports of traumatized and emotionally unavail-
able caregivers are found in studies of war-affected children
(Al-Mashat et al., 2006; Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg,
1997; Anstiss & Ziaian, 2010; Dyregrov et al., 2002; Hadi &
Llabre, 1998; Henley & Robinson, 2011; Laor et al., 1997;
Paardekooper et al., 1999; Qouta et al., 2003; Saile et al.,
2014; Thabet et al., 2008). Various studies have found that
there is a higher rate of mental health problems within refu-
gee parent populations as opposed to civilian populations
(McFarlane et al., 2011). Psychological unavailability of
caregivers, due to traumatization or physical absence, may
contribute to long-term psychological challenges in children
(Cicchetti, Toth, & Lynch, 1997). Studies have shown that
the mental health of caregivers is a key predictor of the men-
tal health of children (Betancourt & Khan, 2008). In a study
of families living in the Gaza Strip during periods of vio-
lence, the emotional responses of children and their parents
were found to be interrelated (Thabet et al., 2008). Parents'
PTSD scores predicted their children's PTSD symptoms.
Likewise, parents' anxiety scores predicted their children's
anxiety symptoms. Similarly, Ajdukovic and Ajdukovic
(1998) found that the number of children's adjustment diffi-
culties correlated with their mother's post-traumatic stress
reactions. More recently, Saile and colleagues (2014) shed
light on the complex interaction between child and caregiver
mental health in post-conflict settings. This study examined
distal and proximal risk factors for child victimization by
caregivers in Northern Uganda. Results indicate that aggres-
sive parenting behaviors by caregivers was predicted by their
own experiences of childhood maltreatment, female caregiv-
ers victimization in intimate partner relationships, and male
caregivers symptoms of PTSD and alcohol use.
Caregivers also play an important role in accessing help
for traumatized children, as caregivers usually possess the
most intimate knowledge of their children's well-being.
Unfortunately, caregivers are sometimes unaware of their
children's mental health issues (Henley & Robinson, 2011;
Miller, Mitchell, & Brown, 2005; Papageorgiou et al., 1999).
This lack of awareness may be due to lack of attention from
caregivers (Klingman, 2006), the caregiver's own debilitation
from trauma, or children's attempts to shield or protect their
caregivers. At other times, caregivers may fail to notice or
even discourage children's attempts to process traumatic
events through re-experiencing play, hoping that children will
simply forget the trauma (Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg,
1997). For example, Dyregrov et al. (2002) reported that it
was common practice in Iraq for parents to tell their children
to forget what had happened. Furthermore, refugee parents
may be unwilling to utilize mental health services for their
children because of the stigma associated with mental health
issues (Anstiss & Ziaian, 2010; Henley & Robinson, 2011).
Adaptive responses.Support is vital for children and adoles-
cents to recover from traumatic experiences. Social (Barber,
2001; Bates et al., 2005; Hek, 2005; Kovacev & Shute, 2004;
Kuterovac-Jagodic, 2003; Stewart, Simich, Shizha, Makumbe,
& Makwarimba, 2012; Werner, 2012), familial (Barber, 2001;
Betancourt, Salhi, et al., 2012; Hadi & Llabre, 1998; Hek,
2005; Laor et al., 1997; Punamäki et al., 2001; Servan-Sch-
reiber et al., 1998; Thabet et al., 2009; Werner, 2012;Yohani &
Larsen, 2009), peer (Barber, 2001; Bates et al., 2013; Correa-
Velez, Gifford, & Barnett, 2010; Dyregrov et al., 2000; Hek,
2005; Kovacev & Shute, 2004; Yohani & Larsen, 2009), and
community supports (Yohani, 2008) are identified as signifi-
cant resilience factors for the adaptation of war-affected chil-
dren and adolescents. For children, the school environment is
of major importance as they adjust. Schools can make a differ-
ence in refugee children's ability to settle, build a sense of
belonging, develop socially and emotionally, and regain a
sense of structure and routine (Humphries & Mynott, 2001;
Rana, Qin, Bates, Luster, & Saltarelli, 2011; Rousseau & Guz-
der, 2008; Rutter, 2003; Yohani, 2013).
Positive familial relationships and parental support
appear to be particularly important for children to respond
adaptively following war. In a qualitative study by Kanji
and Cameron (2010), Afghani refugee children resettled in
Canada frequently mentioned the importance of family and
how being united with their family gave them strength, sup-
port, and a sense of security. Iraqi children reported main-
taining physical closeness with their parents as a way of
coping with their trauma (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Similarly,
Correa-Velez et al. (2010) found that there was a significant
Yohani 7
correlation between living at home with parents and
increased well-being within refugee children resettled in
Melbourne, Australia. According to Thabet et al. (2009),
greater parental support was related to lower levels of expo-
sure to traumatic events among Palestinian children living
in the Gaza Strip. Parental support was also found to be
associated with lower post-traumatic symptoms scores
(Thabet et al., 2009). Harmonious parenting, in which chil-
dren felt loved and accepted by both parents, was linked to
better adjustment among Palestinian children (Punamäki
et al., 2001). Catani et al. (2010) conducted cross-sectional
studies that focused on the impact of the Asian tsunami and
domestic violence on youth living in Sri Lanka who had also
experienced civil war in their country. Positive adaptation
was measured by analyzing the sample's post-traumatic
stress symptoms, somatic complaints, psychosocial func-
tioning, and reports of their schoolwork. It was found that
family support was a predictor of positive adaptation. These
findings indicate that it is imperative to protect parents after
adversity to help their children recover. Conversely, discrep-
ant parenting, where children perceived their mothers but
not their fathers as loving and caring, was characteristic of
children with higher levels of PTSD. Punamäki et al. (2001)
also reported that Palestinian children who felt loved and
accepted at home were more likely to fulfill their intellec-
tual and creative potential.
The quality and supportiveness of the recovery environ-
ment following trauma contributes to the outcome of early
PTSD reactions (Steel, Silove, Bird, McGorry, & Mohan,
1999). In a study of children and adolescents living in a
Rwandan unaccompanied center (Dyregrov et al., 2000), the
psychosocial environment of the center, including camara-
derie with other children, basic needs being met, education,
and trained staff, was believed to have a healing effect on
the children. Compared with children in the community,
children living at the center actually exhibited lower levels
of distress, even though "children living at centers initially
experienced more losses and greater violence exposures
than children in the community" (Dyregrov et al., 2000, p.
16). Similarly, refugee children and staff of an early inter-
vention program in Canada both identified hope as a per-
sonal resource that was engendered when children felt
supported by adult staff and other important caregivers
(Yohani, 2008). According to Durà-Vilà and colleagues
(2013), the delivery of mental health services in schools and
being able to consult with teachers are highly beneficial for
refugee children's adjustment after trauma. Alternatively,
loss of social connections and separation from family mem-
bers appear to maintain symptoms of depression and PTSD
(Bates et al., 2013; Gorst-Unsworth & Goldenberg, 1998;
Hauff & Vaglum, 1995).
The needs of children and adolescents without families need
to be handled sensitively in the aftermath of war. Dyregrov
et al. (2000) cautioned that within-country adoptions of war-
affected children need to be conducted with discretion, and
Hek (2007) outlined the advantages and disadvantages of fos-
ter-care programs in resettlement countries. Although most
societies have traditions to care for parentless children in the
absence of blood relations (Mirza, 2006), communities may be
less able to care for children in the immediate aftermath of
widespread destruction, like the Rwandan genocide (Dyregrov
et al., 2000; Mirza, 2006). Instead, group care may be an option
while communities rebuild and recover, as it can foster social
and cognitive development, as noted by research with Eritrean
orphans (Wolff, Tesfai, Egasso, & Aradom, 1995), and meets
basic needs, as noted in Rwanda (Dyregrov et al., 2000). For
unaccompanied minors moving to settlement countries, care-
giving arrangements vary depending on host country and can
range from placement in group homes, shared apartments, to
foster homes. In a study of asylum seeking adolescents from
Afghanistan in the United Kingdom (Bronstein et al., 2012),
foster care was found to be negatively associated with PTSD.
Highly committed foster parents are also crucial, as noted in
studies of unaccompanied refugee youth in foster care in
United Kingdom (Wade, Sirriyeh, Kohli, & Simmonds, 2012)
and the United States (Luster, Qin, Bates, Johnson, & Rana,
2009). The relationship between caregivers and unaccompa-
nied minors appears to be the crucial element in the success of
these various care arrangements, providing evidence for the
role of attachment/bonds domain of the ADAPT model. Bates
and colleagues (2005) advocated specifically for the impor-
tance of open-minded and flexible foster-care placements that
take into account the unique pre- and post-migration experi-
ences and needs of the children in care.
Rebuilding community and social structures in the wake
of conflict may offer avenues for children to restore their
bonds with the larger community. In a study of Israeli pre-
schoolers, "reconstitution of the socio-cultural layer of the
protective matrix may have promoted adaptation of the chil-
dren and facilitated a reduction in stress symptoms" (Laor
et al., 1997, p. 354). Active community involvement was
also identified by children and school officials as both pro-
tective and healing for Tibetan refugee minors (Servan-
Schreiber et al., 1998). Afghan refugee children resettled in
Canada expressed how support from their Ismaili commu-
nity and their involvement in community-related activities
greatly helped them to adjust (Kanji & Cameron, 2010).
Conversely, neighborhood disorganization was linked to
behavior problems among Palestinian youth (Barber, 2001).
Maladaptive responses. As previously identified in the safety
system, symptoms of PTSD (e.g., see Attanayake et al.,
2009), sadness or depression (e.g., see Thabet & Vostanis,
2000), anxiety (e.g., see Werner, 2012), guilt (e.g., see
McFarlane et al., 2011), and shame (Al-Mashat et al., 2006),
occur frequently in studies of war-affected children and ado-
lescents. Clearly, traumatic events and responses to trauma
are multifaceted. Viewed within the ADAPT model, these
affective and behavioral responses likely arise from trau-
matic events that affect both children's sense of safety and
8 SAGE Open
attachment. Safety and attachment are highly salient, inter-
connected needs for children and do not function in isolation.
For example, Schaal and Elbert (2006) reported that the two
events most strongly related to PTSD symptoms in Rwandan
youth were witnessing the murder of a parent and the belief
that they themselves would die. However, theoretically,
Silove notes that maladaptive responses to losses accumu-
lated from threats to attachment systems involve grief and
depressive reactions. In a study of Croatian refugee children,
depression was correlated with deteriorating family rela-
tions, poorer relationships with mothers, and the child's per-
ceived rejection by the mother (Ajdukovic & Ajdukovic,
1998). It was also reported that children who lacked a sup-
portive family environment had higher levels of stress-
related symptoms and were at special risk for developing
further psychological difficulties.
In the face of war-related trauma, families may lose their
ability to function in a healthy and adaptive manner. When
parents and children both experience trauma, family cohesion
and parental capacity may be impacted (Almqvist & Brandell-
Forsberg, 1997). In response to war-related stress, approaches
to parenting may alter, evoking more authoritative parenting
styles, less supervision of children, or less positive communi-
cation (Klingman, 2006). Similarly, the results of a study by
van Ee, Kleber, and Mooren (2012) showed that asylum
seeker and refugee mothers experiencing post-traumatic
stress are at a higher risk for insensitive or unstructured inter-
actions with their infants. Ajdukovic and Ajdukovic (1998)
reported that as Croatian refugee children exhibited more
stress reactions, maternal gentleness decreased. Difficulties in
relationships with others may spread beyond the family, as
well. In a group of internally displaced Bosnians, children
reported being unwilling or unable to play with others
(Goldstein et al., 1997).
Justice
War violates every right of a child-- the right to life, the right to
be with family and community, the right to health, the right to
the development of the personality and the right to be nurtured
and protected. (United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 10)
During war in his country of Uganda, an 11-year old boy
witnessed his mother being murdered. In addition, the boy
and his family were unable to provide an appropriate burial
for his mother's body. These experiences troubled the boy for
a long time. The boy believed he could never forgive the
crimes he had witnessed and considered joining the army to
seek revenge. However, over time he came to realize that he
would be shooting and killing innocent people. Seeking
revenge would have caused others to go though what he was
going through. Recognizing this, the boy decided to break the
chain of violence and walk away from it. At age 19, he
decided to study law, with the hope of making a difference in
his country's judicial system.
Description.Common definitions of justice tend to include
(a) the quality of being just, (b) fairness, (c) conforming to
moral rightness in action or attitude, and (d) the upholding of
fair treatment and due reward in accordance with honor,
standards, or law (Houghton Mifflin, 2006). Experiences that
threaten an individual's sense of justice include torture,
human rights violations, dehumanization, corruption, exploi-
tation, and the presence of perpetrators living with impunity
in the community (Silove, 2000). These experiences are psy-
chologically traumatizing due to their propensity to humili-
ate and shame the individuals and communities. In response
to these justice violations, Silove (2000) argued that "one
pathway of adaptation to injustice is therefore to struggle for
the creation of social structures that will prevent similar
abuses in the future" (p. 344). In addition, Silove notes that
"many great humanitarian leaders of this century themselves
suffered persecution at some point in their careers" (p. 344),
including Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Interest-
ingly, the boy in the previous case followed a similar path-
way to these great leaders.
Justice-related threats can happen to children in their
country of origin or following the conflict in a settlement
country. Children may experience persecution (Almqvist &
Brandell-Forsberg, 1997) for religious beliefs or cultural
identity. Being prevented from helping wounded individuals
during conflict (Qouta et al., 2003) may also affect children's
beliefs about justice. Following war, perpetrators of violence
and destruction sometimes remain in their community with
impunity (Dyregrov et al., 2000), continually reminding chil-
dren of the unpunished atrocities that were committed. In
settlement countries, threats to justice can occur at an indi-
vidual or societal level. For example, children may be dis-
criminated against because of their refugee status (Bates
et al., 2005; Ellis et al., 2010) or they may be marginalized
by legislation regarding refugees (Hek, 2005). These experi-
ences may leave children and adolescents feeling powerless
to impact their environment (Paardekooper et al., 1999) leav-
ing them with unresolved anger and shame. Acts of discrimi-
nation toward refugee students can also lead to PTSD and
depressive symptoms (Correa-Velez et al., 2010).
Adaptive and maladaptive responses.Respect and empower-
ment are central to just responses to war violence. At the
forefront, service delivery and interventions should be con-
veyed in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner for
children and their families (Thabet & Vostanis, 2000; Yohani,
2008). These practices involve consultation with community
members and development of culturally sensitive practices
(Bates et al., 2005). Measures used to evaluate intervention
effects should also be culturally sensitive as symptoms can
be expressed in a variety of ways depending on the social and
cultural context (Betancourt, Meyers-Ohki, Charrow, & Tol,
2013).
Responses that encourage and empower children and
adults to take a stand against injustice offer adaptive ways to
Yohani 9
address war-related atrocities. Although it may seem coun-
terintuitive, from the ADAPT model's perspective, remain-
ing distressed because perpetrators remain unpunished in the
community (Dyregrov et al., 2000), is actually a healthy
response for children and adolescents. Their distress sug-
gests that children have not given up and accepted that these
situations are inevitable. For Tibetan refugee children, par-
ticipating in their nation's struggle against oppression was
identified as a healing and protective factor (Servan-
Schreiber et al., 1998). Similarly, Iraqi children spoke about
their resentment toward the occupying Americans and their
desire to help remove the occupying army (Al-Mashat et al.,
2006). Specifically, continuing engagement in political
activities has been associated with a good prognosis of PTSD
symptoms (Allden et al., 1996). Palestinian children who
responded actively to political violence had fewer traumatic
symptoms and less emotional disorders compared with pas-
sive children (Punamäki et al., 2001). Israeli children
exposed to war with strong ideological commitment did not
report as many psychological impacts as those with weak
ideological commitment (Punamäki, 1996). Finally, adults
can also advocate on behalf of the rights of children in con-
flict situations. Goldstein et al. (1997) encouraged profes-
sionals, like pediatricians, to publicize the effects of war on
children and bring public attention to injustices and specific
needs of children. There is a need to further examine the
nature of children's involvement in justice-related activities
as such engagement can be dangerous or contribute to further
distress, depending on context.
Promoting a sense of justice and fairness in schools can
assist children and adolescents as they resettle during post-
conflict. For example, in resettlement countries, anti-bullying
policies can contribute to students developing feelings of
belonging in new schools (Hek, 2005). According to Montero,
Ibrahim, Loomis, and Newmaster (2012), anti-bullying pro-
grams must address "anti-immigrant sentiments" that many
refugee students face to further increase feelings of belonging.
In the United Kingdom, Blackwell and Melzak (2000) encour-
aged schools to understand and work with the behavior of refu-
gee students in ways that cause children to feel neither
disadvantaged nor specially privileged. However, this may be a
difficult task, as noted in one study whereby some Sudanese
students viewed educational assistance to address gaps in their
educationas"punishment"(Milleretal.,2005,p.28).Likewise,
educational researchers (Derwing, Decorby, Ichikawa, &
Jamieson, 1999; Seat, 2003) have noted that some children
report feeling marginalized and stigmatized by being placed in
English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. Furthermore,
teacher misunderstandings toward newcomer students because
of lack of cultural awareness (McBrien & Day, 2012) and low-
ered expectations from teachers (Rana et al., 2011) can lead to
increased feelings of marginalization. These perspectives can
be understood in light of other studies that suggest newcomer
children are often rejected by their peers and are discriminated
against for not being able to speak English (Anisef & Kilbride,
2000; Rummens & Dei, 2010). In these contexts, children's
responses can be viewed as attempts to resist systems that
threaten to contribute to isolation and marginalization.
Exposure to violence also seems to affect children's
beliefs regarding appropriate responses to war. Former child
soldiers in Uganda and the Congo with more PTSD symp-
toms were less open to reconciliation and had more feelings
of revenge than those with fewer PTSD symptoms (Bayer
et al., 2007). In a study of Israeli youth, greater exposure to
violence tended to be related to more negative attitudes
toward peace (Solomon & Lavi, 2005).
Silove notes that unlike other affective responses, like
depression or anxiety, the DSM classification system does
not contain primary anger syndromes (Silove, 2000). He pro-
poses that further research is necessary to examine the pos-
sibility of a traumatic anger disorder for survivors of human
rights injustices. This may be particularly relevant for under-
standing the behaviors of older children and adolescents.
Aggressive behavior is often found in children and adoles-
cents who survive war-trauma (Belsky, 2008; Miller et al.,
2005; Paardekooper et al., 1999; Qouta et al., 2003).
Although some might argue that aggression and anger should
be placed as responses to safety violations, others may view
them as responses to unfair and unjust treatment. The per-
ceived source of the maladaptive response affects the inter-
ventions proposed to address the behavior. For example, if
aggressive behavior is postulated to stem from fear, interven-
tions may involve managing physiological hyper-arousal
using cognitive and behavioral approaches. However, if
aggressive behavior is thought to stem from justice viola-
tions, interventions may include social justice activities
aimed at empowering youth to make positive changes.
Identity and Roles
All cultures recognize adolescence as a highly significant period
in which young people learn future roles and incorporate the
values and norms of their societies. The extreme and often
prolonged circumstances of armed conflict interfere with
identity development. (United Nations, 1996 (Machel Report),
p. 40)
A 14-year-old Iraq-born boy, arrived in Canada with his
single-parent mother and was placed in a junior high school
after less that four years of formal schooling during the war
in his home country. At school he struggled academically
and socially. His attendance was poor and he had conflicts
with his teachers and other school personnel. When the boy
began high school the following year, his attendance contin-
ued to be sporadic. The boy's neighbourhood had high rates
of criminal and gang activity, and he started to move toward
these activities. The school recommended that he enroll in a
reform school, but the boy did not want to go. The boy's
mother tried to discipline him, but nothing seemed to work.
The boy's involvement with gangs made him appear "cool"
10 SAGE Open
among his peers. Some youth in the community were
impressed that he appeared to be providing for his family,
even if he was doing so using illegal means. The boy became
a role model for other vulnerable students, some who fol-
lowed his example and joined gangs.
Description.A major developmental task for adolescents is
identity formation (Erikson, 1959). As children grow and
develop toward adulthood, they must cultivate "a firm and
coherent sense of who they are, where they are heading, and
where they fit into society" (Shaffer, Wood, & Willoughby,
2002, p. 460). War severely disrupts a child's sense of conti-
nuity, where day-to-day routines and expectations like
attending school or playing with friends are lost (Klingman,
2006). Children's roles, and subsequently their identity, may
be forced to alter drastically. Children may change roles from
students to soldiers, being cared for by parents to caring for
siblings after the loss of both caregivers, or citizens of their
own country to outsiders in a new country. Because of the
plasticity of the brain, adolescents forge new identities in
relation to the experiences they encounter. This could explain
how the young boy in the case vignette easily identified with
a local gang and how children recruited by armed groups
grow to view themselves as part of armed groups.
Having one's social position, roles, possessions, and
school stripped away may seriously threaten a child's "sense
of empowerment, efficacy and individuality" (Silove, 2005,
p. 345). As when children move to a new country, they are
often faced with roles and expectations differing from those
in their country of origin. Fantino and Colak (2001)
explained, "the uprooting, disruption, and insecurity inherent
in migration affect psychological and social development,
making the process of identity formation a more difficult bal-
ancing act between two or more sets of cultural notions and
values" (p. 591). Bates et al. (2005) examined resettlement
experiences for unaccompanied Sudanese refugee youth
placed in foster care in America. Differences in gender roles
and behaviors caused confusion. In foster homes, cultural
differences regarding household roles created difficulties
when boys resisted cooking as "women's work" and feared
mockery for working in the kitchen. At school, boys also
found female assertiveness very different in dating relation-
ships. Similarly, two studies in Australia found Afghan
(Iqbal, Joyce, Russo, & Earnest, 2012) and Burmese (Koh,
Liamputtong, & Walker, 2013) female refugee youth faced
difficulties in negotiating their identity because of differing
gender roles and expectations between their culture of origin
and mainstream Australian culture.
In some wars, individuals are targeted on the basis of their
ethnic identity. For example, during the 1994 genocide
against the Tusti in Rwanda, approximately 800,000 Tutsis
were killed by Hutus (Mirza, 2006). Hilker (2009) studied
Rwandan youth about 10 years after the genocide. Although
political attempts have been made to de-emphasize ethnicity,
Hilker found that discussions about ethnicity had become a
taboo and moved underground. Ethnic stereotyping was still
pervasive among Rwandan youths who continuously catego-
rized important others by perceived ethnic identity. This pro-
cess of categorization is complex, uncertain, and often
contradictory; it fails to capture the lived reality, which is
more complex than the ethnic categories largely based on
stereotypes. Hilker also explains that the war affected young
Rwandans' trust of others, especially those in other ethnic
groups. For reconciliation to be most effective among
Rwandans, Hilker argues for the need to challenge ideas
about the "conceptual Tutsi" and "conceptual Hutu." Hilker
explains that,
a first step would be to encourage "concrete" Hutus, Tutsis and
"mixed" Rwandans to discuss their views and experiences
openly, to acknowledge the plurality of their identities and to
foster affiliations with others based on other common experiences
and interests. (p. 97)
Adaptive and maladaptive responses.As school occupies a
central part in a child's world, it makes sense that school
experiences would strongly affect identity and role develop-
ment for war-affected children and adolescents. However,
discrimination is a reoccurring theme among refugee chil-
dren in school settings (J. Stewart, 2012). Perceived discrim-
ination and resulting stress have an impact on identity
formation in children due to the internalization of negative
messages (Derluyn & Broekaert, 2008), activation of pre-
migration traumatic reminders (Derluyn & Broekaert, 2008),
and correlation with depressive symptomology (Ellis et al.,
2010; Ellis et al., 2008). Yet the literature also suggests chil-
dren and adolescents actively resist such threats to their iden-
tity by concealing their ethnic identity (Khanlou, Koh, &
Mill, 2008; Shakya et al., 2010), using humor, or confronta-
tion (Montero et al., 2012; Oikonomidoy, 2007). Ultimately,
institutions such as schools play a key role in protecting chil-
dren from ongoing threats to identity. Hek (2005) examined
the role of education in the settlement experiences of adoles-
cent refugees in the United Kingdom. Allowing refugee
minors to bring pieces of their personal and cultural identity
were important factors in school settlement, including creat-
ing links between home and school, employing teachers with
similar cultural-linguistic backgrounds, and the promotion of
first languages. In addition, being allowed to self-identify as
refugees and feeling that their experiences and contributions
were valued by staff and students instilled a sense of belong-
ing in adolescent refugees.
Developing a sense of one's own identity and establishing
attitudes toward other groups are typical developmental
activities in adolescence (Branch, 2001). Fantino and Colak
(2001) explained that these normal developmental tasks are
complicated for refugee children in Canada, who face the
challenge of meaningfully integrating "their history with the
present and future realities of Canada" (p. 595). As young
refugees relocate to new countries, they are faced with the
Yohani 11
tasks of navigating cultural differences and acculturation.
Berry (1984) developed a four-part model of acculturation
based on the level at which individuals participate in the host
culture (high/low) and retain their previous cultural identity
(high/low): assimilation, integration, separation, and margin-
alization. In a study of adolescents from the former Republic
of Yugoslavia resettling in Australia (Kovacev & Shute,
2004), an integration approach to acculturation positively
correlated with measures of psychosocial adjustment, includ-
ing global self-worth and peer-social acceptance. Integration
occurs when individuals' maintain their native cultural iden-
tity and actively participate in the new country (Berry, 1984).
As such, Kovacev and Shute suggested encouraging refugee
youth to both build bridges with their host society and sus-
tain connections with their culture of origin. Conversely,
youth who rejected either their own culture of origin (assimi-
lation) or the host culture (marginalization) had the lowest
adjustment ratings. Both assimilation and marginalization
seem to equally endanger adolescents' ability to become
group members and, consequently, their ability to develop a
stable identity (Kovacev & Shute, 2004). In a study by
Luster, Qin, Bates, Rana, and Lee (2010), interviews focus-
ing on factors that contributed to successful adaptation
among Sudanese unaccompanied refugees were conducted,
7 years after their settling in the United States. Participants
cited their ability to have an integration approach to accul-
turation, by combining the best of their Sudanese culture
with the best of American culture, as one of the reasons for
their successful adjustment.
Existential Meaning
All sectors of society must come together to build "ethical
frameworks," integrating traditional values of cooperation
through religious and community leaders with international
legal standards. (United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 58)
A 17-year-old girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo
related that at age 13-years, she was separated for two years
from her family during the war in her country. Her family
were devout Christians and members of their local religious
community. During the two years she lived alone in a dis-
placed people's camp and experienced sexual and physical
abuse. These experiences caused her to question the exis-
tence of God and to denounce her religion--even after being
reunited with some members of her family. At age 17-years
she started to attend church and was slowly exploring her
belief system again.
Description.In instances of war, entire populations and
regions are disrupted on multiple levels, including personal,
familial, and societal, through violence and the destruction of
physical property and infrastructure (Klingman, 2006). Fol-
lowing war, children and adolescents are left striving to re-
establish their basic human needs for equilibrium (Kahana,
Kahana, Harel, & Rosner, 1998; Williams-Gray, 1999) and to
find reasons for the pain and suffering they experienced. War-
fare exposes children to information and experiences which
may dispute their central beliefs that people are trustworthy;
that the world is meaningful, predictable, and safe; and that
the self is worthy (Janoff-Bulman, 1992). Silove (1999) wrote
that "exposure to inexplicable evil and cruelty can shake the
foundations of the survivor's faith in the beneficence of life
and humankind" (p. 204). In a study of Israeli youth, both
objective and subjective measures of exposure were associ-
ated with PTSD symptoms (Solomon & Lavi, 2005), but sub-
jective measures made a greater contribution to the variance
of symptoms. This finding suggests that, in addition to actual
exposure, how youth interpret violent exposure affects their
psychological well-being. Examining the research literature
on war-affected children and adolescents, little information
exists on children's meaning-making during and after expo-
sure to mass violence.
Religion and spirituality are one significant source from
which individuals draw and create meaning. This has been
found to be a protective factor in moderating the effect of
war trauma in youth (Werner, 2012). Seeing places of wor-
ship destroyed (Dyregrov et al., 2000) and being prevented
from burying loved ones with dignity, according to religious
traditions (Qouta et al., 2003), are two threats to existential
meaning for children and adolescents. Religion and spiritual-
ity can offer children and adolescents support (Bates et al.,
2005; Kanji & Cameron, 2010) through rituals, shared
beliefs, and spiritual advisors or leaders. When these institu-
tions and practices are threatened, it may strip away chil-
dren's ability to make sense of pain and suffering.
Adaptive and maladaptive responses.Adaptive responses to
trauma offer ways for individuals to begin making sense and
dealing with the atrocities of war. To cope effectively with pro-
longed traumatic situations, children need to be able to con-
struct new metaphors and personal narratives to replace
fragmented understandings shattered by war experiences
(Punamäki, 2002). Symbolizing can help children diminish
anxiety-driven behavior (Kaplan, 2006). Punamäki (1996)
studied Israeli children's ideological commitment, explaining
that this is "psychologically important because people strive to
find a meaning for traumatic events and incorporate them into
their life experiences" (p. 55). She found that the more chil-
dren were exposed to political violence, the more they
expressed ideological commitment. Punamäki (1996) also
reported that children with a strong ideological commitment
had lower levels of psychological problems, as long as their
exposure to war was not overwhelming, compared with those
with a weak commitment. Children with a weak ideological
commitment reported more anxiety and insecurity, depression
and failure, lack of social support, and bad family relations.
Punamäki concluded that "children's responses are based, at
least in part, on the interpretations and meanings they attribute
to these events" (p. 67). Similarly, for Palestinian youth
12 SAGE Open
involved in the Intifada movement, political violence was not
associated with youth problems (Barber, 2001). Barber
ascribes this to the meaning youth appeared to attribute to the
conflict and their commitment to the social and political prin-
ciples underlying it.
Dreaming and playing games may also play a role in help-
ing children to process their traumatic experiences. In a study
of Palestinian children who recorded their dreams, different
characteristics of dreams were associated with the presence
or absence of psychological symptoms (Punamäki, 1998).
For example, children who reported more repetitious,
unpleasant, and aggressive characteristics in their dreams
also reported more psychological symptoms. Conversely, for
children whose dreams were bizarre, vivid, active, and
involved joyful feelings and happy endings, their traumatic
exposure was not associated with psychological symptoms.
These findings led Punamäki (1998) to conclude that "the
protective role of dreaming means that traumatic events are
not associated with mental health symptoms if children's
dreams incorporate beneficial and/or lack dysfunctional
characteristics" (p. 580). Results from a study by Helminen
and Punamäki (2008) also demonstrate how "high intensity
and low negative, and high positive" images in dreams may
protect the mental health of children exposed to trauma.
Children who had been exposed to trauma had less post-trau-
matic symptoms when their dreams included images that
were intensive and positive. Correlations between exposure
to military trauma and anxiety and aggressiveness were not
found in children who had low negative images in their
dreams. A major theme in interviews with Iraqi children was
their interest in war games (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). This
may demonstrate a way children attempt to process and make
sense of the trauma they have experienced.
Both Tibetan child-refugees and school officials spoke of
strong religious beliefs as a protective and healing factor
essential for recovery from stress-related, post-traumatic
symptoms (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1998). Newcomer refu-
gee youth resettled in Canada after escaping war in their
home country of Afghanistan spoke of seeking strength from
God in times of difficulty (Kanji & Cameron, 2010). South
Sudanese children living in a refugee camp in Uganda identi-
fied praying as a coping behavior (Paardekooper et al., 1999).
Likewise, Iraqi children identified prayer and reading the
Koran as giving them a sense of comfort and strength, help-
ing to minimize their fears (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Even in
the face of violence, poverty, and destruction, two thirds of
internally displaced Bosnian children still believed life was
worth living (Goldstein et al., 1997). This statistic suggests
that these children were able to hold onto the belief that good
things in life were still possible. Likewise, refugee children
were able to articulate a sense of hope and sources of hope
during early years of adjustment in Canada (Yohani &
Larsen, 2009).
Sadly, not all war-affected children are able to maintain a
positive outlook on life. Approximately half of surveyed
internally displaced Bosnian children reported feeling pessi-
mistic about the future after the civil war in formerYugoslavia
(Goldstein et al., 1997). Some children develop a sense of
foreshortened future (Al-Mashat et al., 2006), believing they
would not survive until adulthood (Al-Mashat et al., 2006;
Dyregrov et al., 2000; Dyregrov et al., 2002). Conversely, in
a study of Israeli youth, future orientation was not found to
be associated with exposure to terror (Solomon & Lavi,
2005). Interestingly, the most optimistic youth in this study
had experienced the most intensive terror and reported the
highest PTSD symptomatology. Feelings of fear and hope-
lessness are a paradoxical situation for war-affected children
and adolescents. Although loss of hope is not a helpful
response to trauma, it is also representative of a possible real-
ity for children in war-torn areas. Even if children escape the
initial violence of bombings, shootings, and assault, they
must still contend with the lack of food, clean water, sanita-
tion, shelter, and health services - which often follow war.
Summary
This article examined whether the psychosocial systems of
safety, attachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning
found in theADAPT model (2006) are represented in a review
of research from the last 20 years on the experiences and
needs of war-affected children and adolescents. The intention
was to explore whether this model has potential to serve as a
guide for research and practice with war-affected children
given its attention to adaptive and maladaptive responses to
war-trauma. The review is limited by its "wide-net" approach
incorporating literature on war-affected children in conflict,
post-conflict, and resettlement settings. While this was cho-
sen to capture studies addressing adaptive and maladaptive
responses in all five domains, it resulted in an overemphasis
of literature on refugees. Future reviews can utilize a more
focused approach by conducting systematic reviews of one
domain and sub-population of war-affected children.
Results suggest that research with war-affected children
has covered all five psychosocial pillars in the model thereby
showing promise as a meta-theory for conceptualizing the
psychosocial experiences of war-affected children. However,
the review highlighted the research community's emphasis
on the safety domain with most studies focusing on the iden-
tification of PTSD in children and adolescents. This mirrors
the fact that much of the research on war-affected individuals
is conducted by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists whose
instruments rely on the respective clinical manuals (ICD or
DSM). The focus on safety is followed by research within the
attachment domain. Research in this area emphasizes the
role of social supports and caregivers as protective factors
and resources for children's adaptation after mass violence
and familial losses. Maladaptive responses to such losses are
similar to those found within the safety domain and include
PTSD, depression, and anxiety as the main outcomes of
threats to attachment systems. Safety and attachment are
Yohani 13
highly salient, interconnected needs for children that do not
function in isolation, and it may be difficult to tease apart
whether disorders such as PTSD are responses to safety vio-
lations, attachment violations, or both. However, from a
theoretical point of view, the ADAPT model suggests that
grief and depressive reactions are maladaptive responses to
losses accumulated from threats to attachment systems.
Future research with war-affected children may clarify this
further with the recent expansion of criteria for PTSD and
inclusion of other trauma-related disorders in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;
APA, 2013).
This review shows that the least amount of research was
found within the domains of identity, justice, and meaning.
Given the significance of these areas in child and adolescent
development, future research and interventions should exam-
ine adaptive and maladaptive responses in these three areas
to expand our knowledge base of children's experiences
beyond the emphasis on safety and attachment. For example,
are conduct and severe anger problems in war-affected ado-
lescents a maladaptive response to threats to injustice? If so,
what types of interventions can be implemented to ensure
adolescents experience resolution and positive adaption in
the aftermath of such threats? How do we address young
people's meaning-making systems in conflicts involving
threats to religious ideologies and places of worship? Finally,
it is worth noting that the areas covered in the ADAPT model
and this review were equally covered in Machel's (United
Nations, 1996) Impact of Armed Conflict on Children report
almost 20 years ago. Although children and adolescents con-
tinue to be adversely affected in war, the research commu-
nity has now amassed substantial empirical evidence giving
us insight into the nature and impact of trauma and of mass
violence on children. Going forward, there is also a need to
place emphasis on researching interventions that build on
such evidence. Research that explores institutional policies
and practices that support interventions for children and fam-
ilies in post-conflict and resettlement environments should
also consider socio-ecological frameworks. As such, as the
ADAPT model can be a guide to ensure psychosocial
domains of safety, attachment, human rights/justice, identity,
and existential meaning are equally addressed.
