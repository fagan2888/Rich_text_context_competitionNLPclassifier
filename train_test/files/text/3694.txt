Information and knowledge are literally the lifeblood of
policing (Gottschalk, 2010; Ratcliffe, 2012), yet maladaptive
information behaviors, values, and cultures along with inef-
fective structures, technologies, policies, and practices
within policing continue to impede information and knowl-
edge sharing within and across police units and organizations
in North America. Support for this statement, from the
American perspective, is illustrated by a recent review into
the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States by Best Jr.
(2011). Within his report, Best Jr. suggested that the paradox
of sharing secret information and risk management as well as
disparate information cultures, technologies, and policies
blinded law enforcement and intelligence agencies to "con-
nect the dots" (p. ii). Similarly, Canadian law enforcement
and intelligence agencies received scathing critiques for their
information and knowledge sharing policy and practice fail-
ures, as illustrated by the Bernardo Investigation Review
(Campbell, 1996); the Commission of Inquiry into the
Bombing of Air India Flight 182 (Government of Canada,
2010); and the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry in
British Columbia (Oppal, 2012). Within these three inci-
dents, police were critiqued for their failure to communicate
and cooperate across jurisdictions, their deficient knowledge
and information support systems and structures, and for per-
sonal and organizational values and biases that blocked
effective and efficient information and knowledge sharing
within and without the police intelligence arena.
The idealized and normative notion of democratic knowl-
edge sharing suggests that information should flow freely
within and across all levels of civil society and that every
person would have access to the information (Veld, 2010).
However, this free flow of information, within the context of
contemporary policing, must be grounded within the realities
and influence of information and knowledge accessibility,
politics, need for information security, values, and organiza-
tional context. Whereas much attention in recent years has
been focused on the criminal intelligence aspects of informa-
tion and knowledge sharing in police organizations, the
broader and more common day-to-day impediments to infor-
mation and knowledge sharing within the larger body of rank
and file officers have largely been overlooked.
Despite the broadly reported business management tenet
that organizational information and knowledge resources are
key assets to be exploited to support better organizational
decision making, policies and practices, innovation and out-
comes, many police organizations do not have explicit
knowledge management (KM) strategies and/or persistently

Impediments to Information and
Knowledge Sharing Within Policing:
A Study of Three Canadian Policing
Organizations
Douglas Edward Abrahamson1,2 and Jane Goodman-Delahunty2
Abstract
Information sharing is the lifeblood of policing, yet information/knowledge sharing within and across organizations remains
problematic. This article elaborated on previous research on organizational information culture and its impact on information
use outcomes in policing by examining perceived impediments to information sharing of 134 officers in three Canadian
police organizations. Inductive qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed seven mutually exclusive impediment
themes: processes/technology, individual unwillingness, organizational unwillingness, workload/overload, location/structure,
leadership, and risk management. When viewed from the knowledge management infrastructure perspective, organizational
structure was the single most common impediment identified, followed closely by organizational culture. Each organization
had unique constellations of information sharing impediments. Recommendations for policy and practice are discussed.

fail to recognize that management of knowledge resources
involves factors above and beyond the requisite technologi-
cal support systems (Chávez, Pendleton, & Bueerman, 2005;
Gottschalk, 2008; Seba & Rowley, 2010). This issue is not
unique to policing, as public and private sector organizations
often ignore organizational structure, process capabilities,
culture and/or organizational context factors when imple-
menting KM systems or considering the overall health of
their information and knowledge sharing environments
(Alavi, Kayworth, & Leidner, 2005; Detlor et al., 2006;
Gold, Malhotra, & Segars, 2001). In addition, many police
organizations fail to fully explore or understand the underly-
ing information and KM context, structures, and processes,
each of which may act either as barriers or enablers to infor-
mation and knowledge acquisition, organization, control,
dissemination, and use within the organization (Ekblom,
2002; Gottschalk, Filstad, Glomseth, & Solli-Saether, 2011).
When examined from a North American policing perspec-
tive, such oversights are far from trivial and must be addressed
for three important reasons: First, the political, social, eco-
nomic, and information sharing context in which police orga-
nizations operate has become increasingly complex and
inter-dependent (Ratcliffe, 2012). At the same time, stake-
holders have become more demanding for public sector
reforms, which include the need for improved accountability,
efficacy, and efficiency (Stone & Travis, 2011; Walsh &
Conway, 2011). Second, police organizations are knowledge
intensive and rely on a deep and broad information and
knowledge base to support organizational administrative,
operational, and strategic initiatives (Dean & Gottschalk,
2007). Third, all contemporary North American policing
models rely on information and knowledge to feed and sup-
port their crime prevention and enforcement innovations and
models, including, but not limited to intelligence-led
(Ratcliffe, 2012), evidence-based (Haberman & King, 2011),
Compstat (Willis, Mastrofski, & Kochel, 2010), problem-
oriented, and/or community-based policing models (Braga &
Weisburd, 2007). Information and knowledge sharing best
practices, as they relate to North American intelligence-led
policing and related policing models and as a means to effec-
tively and efficiently manage limited police resources, have
strong ties to the British National Intelligence Model (Bureau
of Justice Assistance, 2008; Maguire & John, 2006). In 2006,
Canada chose to develop and implement a "made-in-Canada"
criminal intelligence model, which also had a strong focus on
"effective intelligence-led policing by establishing standards
for intelligence-related structures, processes and practices"
(Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, 2008, p. 1).
Despite the importance of individual police officers in the
process of information and knowledge sharing, across all
police endeavors, few empirical studies of the effectiveness
of information sharing within police organizations have been
conducted. Accordingly, little is known about potential barri-
ers that may impede knowledge and information sharing at
the individual police officer and organization level.
The aim of the present study was to identify the informa-
tion sharing impediments within this policing context, to
identify potential policy and practice misalignment(s), and to
gain a better understanding of the information barriers faced
by the rank and file officers so that police leaders will be
empowered to take appropriate steps to lower and/or elimi-
nate those barriers in the future. A brief overview of KM
practice, theory, and its connection to organizational infra-
structures, as they apply to policing policy and practice,
serves to highlight areas that may become barriers or enablers
to information sharing.
KM
Management and information science studies have docu-
mented a continued evolution toward a knowledge society
where public and private organizations are no longer viewed
as merely processing or using information for problem solv-
ing but also as creating new information and knowledge in a
dynamic process that involves interaction and adaptation to a
changing and turbulent environment (Bason, 2010; Nonaka,
1994; Wiig, 1997). Included within this evolution has been
the advent of knowledge management, whereby knowledge,
in explicit and tacit forms, is an organizational resource to be
captured, created, transferred, and utilized within that orga-
nization (Alavi & Leidner, 2001; Jennex, 2008).
Since the 1990s, organizations have invested significant
time, financial, and other resources in KM systems and prac-
tices in the hopes of achieving increased performance, inno-
vation, and improved decision making (Davenport & Prusak,
1998; Liebowitz, 2011; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). The out-
comes of many of these initiatives within policing have
failed to meet organizational expectations as governmental
support has been mixed and mere information passing does
not constitute collaboration or knowledge creation within
this context (Gottschalk, 2007; Hughes & Jackson, 2004).
In addition, a number of academics have challenged the
notion that knowledge, or "what we know," can in fact be
"captured" or embedded within an information technology
(IT) process (Wilson, 2002) or whether it can be "objecti-
fied" due to the nature of interpretation and the divergent
"world views" of those knowing and those receiving (Butler,
2011). Butler (2011) poignantly noted,
. . . if information technology is to be utilized to give voice to
organizational narratives, then it must be recognized that it will
be a conduit for data only. And, because gaps in comprehension
will always exist, no matter how sophisticated the technology
and its power of representation, IT must enable a dialectic to
take place between social actors and the phenomena they wish to
understand. (p. 7)
In essence, IT is not the panacea for effective information
and knowledge creation and management within policing but
merely a system that facilitates the dialectic process between
individuals, organizational units, and external partners. The
Abrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 3
end goal is to create a system that facilitates the conversion
of intelligence into a form that can be operationalized.
Within this individual, organizational, and external dia-
lectic, apparently competing and opposing concepts and
positions are brought to light as police leaders and organiza-
tions respond to policy and practice issues within their com-
munities. Two broad examples of these include budget
constraints and increased public expectations (Police Sector
Council, 2006) and public and private policing (Law
Commission of Canada, 2006). Both examples illustrate two
competing realities that are at the forefront of contemporary
North American policing policy and practice. Therefore, the
dialectic process is important as it is a dynamic process that
allows the reconciliation of what often appear to be compet-
ing and/or polar opposite ideas, concepts, or positions. In
their explanation of paradox and its relation to knowledge,
Takeuchi and Nonaka (2004) posited that in times of com-
plexity, leading organizations must not only face opposing
and paradoxical positions but also embrace a number of
these paradoxes at the same time. Furthermore, instead of
thinking of opposing concepts and positions as "either or"
statements or "this versus that" Takeuchi and Nonaka sug-
gested that mutually inclusive perspectives be taken where
concepts such as "control and independence" (p. 6), "micro
(individual) and macro (environment)" (p. 9), and "top-down
and bottom-up" (p. 9) are considered simultaneously. They
provided an explanation of how these opposing concepts are
actually inter-dependent, inter-penetrating, and unifying:
To complicate matters, we need to understand that opposites are
actually not really opposites; hence the use of terms such as
"what appears to be opposites" or "seemingly opposite" thus far.
For one thing, opposites are interdependent, meaning that
opposites depend on each other. It wouldn't make sense to talk
about darkness if there were no such thing as light. Each member
of a polar opposite seems to need the other to make it what it is.
Second, opposites are interpenetrating, which means that
opposites can be found in each other. There is some light in
every darkness, and some darkness in every light. If we look into
one thing hard enough, we can find its opposite right there.
Third, opposites can turn into the same thing if we take an
opposite to its very ultimate extreme and make it absolute. Thus,
if we make darkness absolute, we are blind--we can't see
anything. And if we make light absolute, we are equally blind
and unable to see. (Takeuchi & Nonaka, 2004, p. 9)
Keeping Takeuchi and Nonaka's (2004) explanation of
paradox in mind, we can see how paradoxes might present
themselves when police leaders try to balance the competing
needs of the police organization, the local community, key
stakeholders, and individual police officers. Having served
more than 30 years in policing and personally observed para-
doxes in various policing contexts in that time period, the
primary author offers a series of seven paradoxical goals
within policing for consideration: secure and open, struc-
tured and flexible, individual and group, conformity and
diversity, innovation and stability, certainty and risk, and
loose and connected. Further elaboration on this topic is pro-
vided in the Conclusion section of this article.
Underpinning these ostensible contradictions are three
KM infrastructures that support the KM process: structural
(Hendriks, 2006), technical (Gold et al., 2001), and cultural
(Jacobson, 2006). Each of these infrastructures may act
either as barrier or enabler to information and knowledge
acquisition, organization, control, dissemination, and use
within police organizations.
The current study extended previous quantitative findings
on organizational information culture and its impact on
information use outcomes in three Canadian policing organi-
zations (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013), by
examining the impediments to information and knowledge
sharing perceived by 134 sworn officers working in these
organizations. This study complements the quantitative study
by providing a rich, complex, and multi-dimensional "insid-
er's" and "ground-level" view of the perceived impediments
to information and knowledge sharing within policing as
identified by the end-users of that information, the officers.
By asking an open-ended question about perceived barriers
to information sharing, we were able to explore the partici-
pant's experiences, values, and behaviors, which would not
be evident or available in the aggregated quantitative data.
KM Infrastructures
Where the resource-based theory of an organization recog-
nizes the importance of the behavioral and social context in
which organizations operate as resources, capabilities, and
competencies (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011), the knowl-
edge-based theory of the organization builds on that platform
by conceptualizing the ability to transfer and utilize knowl-
edge as an organization's greatest asset and competitive
advantage (Nonaka, Toyama, & Hirata, 2008; Spender &
Grant, 1996). This knowledge transfer and utility within the
organization cannot be accomplished without appropriate
infrastructures to support the process. The integral nature of
these support principles within North American policing was
illustrated by quantitative findings showing that information
policies, strategies, and systems (structure and technology),
and information values, norms, and behaviors of the organi-
zation (culture) affected the information use outcomes of
problem solving, creating work that is beneficial, and infor-
mation sharing (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty,2013).
To better understand potential sources of barriers or
impediments to information sharing within police organiza-
tions, a brief account of the three KM infrastructures, as con-
ceptualized by Gold et al. (2001), is provided, namely, the
structural, technical, and cultural components of KM.
KM structures.Organizational KM structures provide the
backbone for power, coordination, and control within an
organization and essentially serve to guide and coordinate
4 SAGE Open
the tasks and activities of individuals as they work toward a
common organizational goal (Liao, Chuang, & To, 2011).
These structures, whether at the unit or organizational level,
serve to align and coordinate lines of responsibility, author-
ity, communication as well as implement institutional rules,
policies, practices, and processes. In addition to the organi-
zational rules and roles that guide individual action, structure
also includes the configuration, placement, and physical
location of individual organizational units, which "can influ-
ence knowledge management processes through shaping pat-
ternsandfrequenciesofcommunicationamongorganizational
members, stipulating locations of decision-making, and
affecting efficiency and effectiveness in implementing new
ideas" (Zheng, Yang, & McLean, 2010, p. 765).
Therefore, the transfer and utility of knowledge within the
organization may be helped or hindered by organizational
structures that are in place at any given point in time, thereby
affecting, positively or negatively, the desired goals and out-
comes of the organization. Within the context of policing,
such structures include rank, roles, and the location and coor-
dination of organizational units, divisions, and/or agencies
among others. By way of example, a prior study of the impact
of information management and information behaviors and
values within three Canadian police organizations revealed
that the structures and processes associated with information
management and information sharing were moderately cor-
related with the achievement of the information use out-
comes (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). This
correlation can be increased by the presence of more effec-
tive structures and processes within the organization.
Information processes and structures, however, do not stand
alone nor operate in isolation and must be supported by a
technical infrastructure.
Technical KM infrastructure. The technical infrastructure pro-
vides technical support for rapid knowledge creation, storage
and retrieval, transfer, and application within the organiza-
tion and may include IT systems such as data warehouses,
Internets, intranets, knowledge directories, and/or portals
(Alavi & Leidner, 2001). This same technology is used to
facilitate communication as well as consolidate what other-
wise would be fragmented flows of information and knowl-
edge within the organization. Accordingly, the technological
structure plays a key role within the KM process (Lee &
Choi, 2003; Teece, 1998).
Technology, as it relates to policing, has profoundly
shaped policing practice over the past 50 years. It was not
that long ago that police officers were given truly "mobile"
police radios. Now, with current technologies, including
mobile data terminals (MDTs) and powerful local, provin-
cial, and national information databases, communication net-
works, and KM systems, police organizations constantly
create, store, retrieve, transfer, and apply knowledge for the
organization's benefit and to improve policy, practice, and
performance. The current study explored whether
technology, along with two other infrastructures, was seen to
facilitate or hinder the information and knowledge sharing
process within three municipal law enforcement agencies.
The technological aspect of KM, however, has had its
critics. Some described it as a management consulting fad
(Wilson, 2002) or as creating a technological dependency
(Huysman & de Wit, 2004) that ignores existing work or
group needs (Malhotra, 2004). Notwithstanding such criti-
cisms, KM technology support systems continue to be used
within the public and private sectors as knowledge transfer
remains a goal for many organizations that wish to improve
performance within their market and local context.Therefore,
the technical infrastructure needs and application must be
given careful consideration in relation to the KM needs and
goals of each policing organization. This perspective was
supported by recent findings indicating that information
management, comprised of information policies, strategies,
and systems within an organization, was one of five factors
that collectively accounted for 41% of the outcome variance
in three Canadian policing organizations (Abrahamson &
Goodman-Delahunty, 2013).
Organizational culture.Organizational culture has consis-
tently been recognized as a primary factor in the success or
failure of information and knowledge sharing within organi-
zations (De Long & Fahey, 2000; Ipe, 2003) and has played
a central role within the findings of this study. Simply put,
organizational culture is defined as the shared assumptions,
beliefs, values (establishing priorities), and norms (establish-
ing appropriate attitudes and behaviors) within an organiza-
tion (Schein, 2004) and includes the sub-cultures that exist
within the various units, sections, or departments within the
organization (Hofstede, 1998). Individuals are not only
guided by their own sets of values but are also governed by
the socially legitimated standards and norms set within the
organization. Corporate cultures can be generally classified
as either weakly or strongly functional (supportive) or
weakly or strongly dysfunctional (not supportive), depend-
ing on how clearly the organizational culture is defined,
communicated, understood, and managed on a day-to-day
basis in relation to the organizational goals (Flamholtz &
Randle, 2011).
A supportive culture is one in which employees not only
understand and articulate the espoused values and standards
of performance but also puts them into action each and every
day. By contrast, a dysfunctional culture is one in which
organizational values, even though they may be known by
employees, are left for personal interpretation and imple-
mentation, with little to no "management" or follow-up by
leaders within the organization (Flamholtz & Randle, 2011;
Schein, 2010). For this reason, leadership is important in
"setting the tone" and facilitating the socialization, external-
ization, combination, and internalization of knowledge and
innovation within and across organizations (von Krogh,
Nonaka, & Rechsteiner, 2012; Wilson, 1997). Knowledge
Abrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 5
and innovation, however, are not organizational assets unless
shared and integrated into practice. Not only does a culture
of knowledge and innovation sharing have practical implica-
tions for policing, it has been recognized as of paramount
importance within all aspects of police operations and strate-
gic management (LeBeuf & Paré, 2005; Murphy & McKenna,
2007).
It is critical that organizational leaders not only identify
the larger technological, structural, and cultural issues that
have supported or impeded the achievement of specific orga-
nizational goals, but they must also specifically identify
which of these factors has the greatest impact on the organi-
zation's ability to achieve its goals. For example,Abrahamson
and Goodman-Delahunty (2013) demonstrated that two
information management and information behavior and
value factors consisting of (a) information management,
integrity, and transparency, and (b) information sharing and
proactiveness collectively accounted for 71% of the variance
in the achievement of specific information use outcomes. By
examining the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
information sharing experiences within these three police
organizations, a broader and deeper understanding can
be gained of the actual and perceived impediments to infor-
mation sharing and how these impediments affect the
achievement of organizational goals and outcomes.
Information Sharing and Use
Human and organizational information use has been viewed
from a variety of perspectives within the discipline of infor-
mation studies. These perspectives include seven informa-
tion use elements/principles that were synthesized from the
broader information studies literature, namely (a) informa-
tion practices, (b) information search, (c) information pro-
cessing, (d) information production, (e) the application of
information, (f) knowledge construction, and (g) the effects
of information use (Kari, 2010). An organization-focused
and pragmatic information use perspective was provided by
Choo (2006), who stated that an organization uses informa-
tion "to make sense of change in its environment; to create
new knowledge for innovation; and to make decisions about
courses of action" (p. 329).
This explanation is particularly important to knowledge
intensive organizations such as police agencies, because a
nexus exists between an organization's information/KM,
information behaviors, values, beliefs, and the organization's
information use outcomes and performance (Abrahamson &
Goodman-Delahunty, 2013; Choo, Bergeron, Detlor, &
Heaton, 2008; Marchand, Kettinger, & Rollins, 2001).
Notably, recent research conducted within police organiza-
tions identified positive correlations between the information
integrity, management, transparency, sharing, and proactive-
ness constructs and the information use outcomes of problem
solving, creating work that is beneficial, and information
sharing (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). Within
the policing organization, these constructs not only affect
information use outcomes but also assist the organization in
making sense of the changes in the larger environment.
Making Sense of Change in Policing
Policing in the modern era is complex, costly, time-consum-
ing, and pluralistic in nature. Police do not merely enforce the
law or maintain the peace within the communities they serve.
There is an expectation that they will reduce crime and disor-
der, reduce fear of crime, solve community issues, and
encourage cooperation within the communities (Gallagher,
Maguire, Mastrofski, & Reisig, 2001). Adding to this com-
plexity is the recognition that organized crime, technological
crime, and terrorism know no boundaries, and these issues are
of local concern as well (Murphy, 2007; Sansfaçon, 2006).
It is within this volatile and equivocal environment that
organizations and their agents wrestle with the discontinuous
nature of reality and attempt to make sense of and manage
the gaps between what was once known, where they are now,
and an unpredictable future through information and knowl-
edge sharing. The nature of this organizational "sense mak-
ing" process was aptly described by Dervin (1998):
Humans, sense making assumes, live in a world of gaps: a reality
that changes across time and space and is at least in part "gappy"
at a given time-space; a human society filled with difference
manifested in madness, culture, personality, inventiveness,
tentativeness and capriciousness; a self that is sometimes
centered, sometimes muddled, and always becoming. In this
view, the sense making and sense unmaking that is knowledge is
a verb, always an activity, embedded in time and space, moving
from a history toward a horizon, made at the juncture between
self and culture, society, organization. (p. 36)
Key within this description is the notion that humans are
not always rational, that they live in social environments, are
influenced by personality and culture, and that the state of
their knowledge is always in flux. Organizations, as human
social constructs, also exist within social environments, are
rationally intended, embody norms, values and beliefs, and
seek and use information to solve problems across time and
space as they strive to achieve future goals and outcomes
(Thompson, 2007; Weick & Sandelands, 1990). Sense mak-
ing, whether at the individual or organizational level, allows
individuals and organizations to acquire new insights into the
problems at hand in new and innovative ways.
Creating New Knowledge for Innovation in
Policing
Organizational knowledge creation and innovation is critical
to all organizations as it is "a continuous process through
which one overcomes the individual boundaries and con-
straints imposed by information and past learning by acquir-
ing a new context, a new view of the world and new
6 SAGE Open
knowledge" (Nonaka, von Krogh, & Voelpel, 2006, p. 1182).
Organizational knowledge creation and innovation within
organizations are neither static nor mechanistic processes,
but dynamic social activities grounded within the history,
relationships, rules, norms, and values of the people within
the organization. It is for this very reason that this study was
interested in the qualitative responses of participants, as they
are indeed grounded in the technical, cultural, and structural
history and values of the organization and affect how infor-
mation is used, whether new knowledge is created, and
whether new innovations are nurtured.
The application or mobilization of new knowledge and
innovation within organizations is traditionally done for eco-
nomic, strategic, and operational advantage, which requires
making decisions between possible courses of action. In con-
trast to the traditional private sector need to apply knowledge
to enhance competitive advantage, public sector organiza-
tions must mobilize new information and knowledge to
enhance administrative, operational, and strategic effective-
ness and efficiencies to better adapt to the changing external
social, political, and economic environments. Without an
understanding of the organizational information sharing
issues that exist at the individual officer level and become
impediments, police leaders will be less effective in reaching
organizational goals and outcomes. This study aids organiza-
tional leaders by providing richer insights into the informa-
tion behaviors and values of their officers and how these may
positively or negatively affect organizational performance.
Method
Participants
Of the 212 respondents who responded to a larger survey,
134 police officers responded to this research study question.
Demographically, participants comprised 84% (n = 113) men
and 16% (n = 21) women, 50% (n = 67) of whom were line
personnel (Constable), 44% (n = 59) were supervisors
(Corporals, Sergeants, or Staff Sergeants), 4% (n = 6) were at
command level (Inspector), and two people (1%) reported
their rank as "other." Reported education indicated that
approximately one half of the respondents (49%) had some
college education, 42% had completed a 4-year college or
university degree, and a small number of officers (3%) had
completed a graduate degree. The remainder (6%) had com-
pleted high school/general education development.
Within each of the three rank/role categories, the educa-
tion levels were reported thusly: Of line personnel, 4%
(n = 3) completed high school/general education develop-
ment, 54% (n = 36) had "some" college, 39% (n = 26) had a
4-year degree, and 3% (n = 2) had a graduate degree. Of
supervisors, 8% (n = 5) completed high school/general edu-
cation development, 49% (n = 29) had "some" college edu-
cation, 41% (n = 24) had a 4-year college/university degree,
and 2% (n = 1) reported a graduate degree. Of the
six command personnel, 17% (n = 1) had "some" college
education, 67% (n = 4) had a 4-year college/university
degree, and 17% (n = 1) reported having a graduate degree.
Materials
This study analyzed responses to an open-ended question
contained within a larger survey questionnaire administered
to three diverse municipal police agencies in Canada
(Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). The question
asked, "In my agency, the greatest impediment(s) to the shar-
ing of valid information and knowledge is/are . . . "
Sampling Procedures
Police Chiefs of four municipal police organizations within
Canada were sent letters of introduction, invitations to par-
ticipate in this study, and research information sheets. Three
agencies agreed to participate in the study: one medium-
sized independent municipal agency (MED-IND), one
medium-sized Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
municipal police agency (MED-RCMP), and one large-sized
independent municipal agency (LRG-IND). All sworn offi-
cers within these agencies (n = 1,850) were eligible to par-
ticipate and received individual email invitations with
web-based survey links. Survey completion was voluntary
and constrained by the operational needs of each organiza-
tion within the data collection period. Therefore, participants
were self-selecting. Within the 4-week data collection period,
a total of 134 valid responses were received with respect to
this research question (MED-IND [n = 29], MED-RCMP
[n = 29], LRG-IND [n = 76]).
Analysis
Responses were analyzed using inductive qualitative meth-
ods (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). This inductive approach
allows "research findings to emerge from the frequent, domi-
nant, or significant themes inherent in the raw data, without
restraints imposed by structured methodologies" (Thomas,
2006, p. 238). Thus, the developed themes were not only
data-driven but were also theoretically bottom-up versus top-
down driven, and presented an "accurate reflection of the
entire data set" (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 83) while allowing
a rich description of the data.
The survey responses were initially close read, re-read,
and then open-coded using qualitative data analysis software
(QDAS). NVivo 8 software was utilized to code the unstruc-
tured textual data and develop and compare emergent themes
and concepts between and across demographic groups
(Bazeley, 2007).
Very few participants (7%) reported that they were
unaware of any impediments to information and knowledge
sharing or that no impediments to information sharing
existed. Most respondents were aware of information sharing
Abrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 7
impediments within their organization and were willing to
share their thoughts on this subject. A recursive and iterative
approach was used in developing the themed categories. On
collapsing all overlapping or otherwise redundant sub-cate-
gories, a total of seven impediment themes emerged. Two
additional categories were created to encapsulate responses
indicating that there were (a) no perceived impediments to
information sharing and (b) miscellaneous responses that
were either blank, ambiguous, or inappropriate in response
to the question. Four responses were excluded from further
analyses as they did not fit any of the final categories due to
ambiguity in the participants'wording. A multi-coder system
was implemented to establish shared interpretative validity
(Maxwell, 1992).
Inter-rater reliability.To assess coding reliability, all open-
ended responses were dual-coded by two trained raters who
identified the theme(s) contained within each response.
Cohen's kappa coefficients were calculated for each category.
The Kappa coefficients yielded good inter-rater results, with
agreement percentages at or above the 90% acceptable level
(Miles & Huberman, 1994). All disparities between raters
were resolved by follow-up discussions to reach consensus.
Results
Definitions of the seven themes or types of impediments to
information sharing that were distinguished, and examples of
each, are displayed in Table 1.
Figure 1 displays the rounded aggregated data on seven
types of impediments to sharing information and knowledge
distinguished by participants across all three Canadian polic-
ing agencies. The percentage of the total for each impedi-
ment and its ranking relative to the other noted impediments
revealed three dominant themes regarding impediments to
information and knowledge sharing across the three police
agencies: processes-technology (24%), individual unwilling-
ness (21%), and organizational unwillingness (15%).
Collectively, these three impediments accounted for 60%
of the barriers to information and knowledge sharing within
the three police organizations. Fewer participants mentioned
"workload-overload" (12%), "location-structure" (10%),
"leadership" (6%), and "risk management" (4%).
A closer inspection of the seven core information and
knowledge sharing impediments was conducted within each
of the three participant organizations to assess what, if any,
differences or similarities were present across organizations.
The seven perceived impediment themes were plotted in
terms of their frequency, and as an individual organizational
value, as shown in Figure 2.
Variability between organizations was most apparent
among the five top-ranking impediments. Accordingly, simi-
larities and differences between the three participating police
agencies regarding these five impediments are briefly
summarized.
Top-Ranked Impediments to Information and
Knowledge Sharing
Processes and technology.Overall, "processes-technology,"
which represents internal and external information sharing
processes, systems, policies, and technologies (e.g., informa-
tion portals, police records information management systems
such as PRIME,1 email) within the organization, was identi-
fied by many participants as the greatest single impediment to
information sharing across the three police organizations. This
barrier was perceived to exist by more than two fifths (43%) of
the MED-RCMP participants, more than a quarter of the
sworn officers (28%) employed by the LRG-IND agency, and
about one in five police (18%) in the MED-IND agency. In the
latter agency, this theme was ranked as the second most sig-
nificant impediment to information sharing, accounting for
16% fewer responses than the impediment characterized by
"individual unwillingness" to share information.
When specifying the aspect of process that created the
impediment, several participants blamed organizational
incentives for individual merit as opposed to teamwork: " . . .
a promotional system which embraces singular deeds thereby
leading to information hoarding and stealing" (LRG-IND,
supervisor). Another police supervisor stated,
Iseethisprimarilyasanissueinvolvingtheartofcommunication.
As long as we hire/employ human beings and not machines, we
are at the mercy of those who wish to hoard information and not
share same. We can establish a myriad of systems to disseminate
information/facts, unless the will is there to share it, to ensure it
is broadcasted, we will continue to struggle with this. (MED-
RCMP, supervisor)
Both comments reflect the often-discussed but often-
neglected need to address the social aspect of information
sharing and the formal and informal organizational reward
systems that exist within organizations creating incentives
and disincentives to share information (Bartol & Srivastava,
2002).
Participants from independent and national police agen-
cies suggested that technology policies and systems were the
primary impediments: "Our information technology section
and their overly restrictive policies" (LRG-IND, supervisor)
and "Various systems that do not talk to one another through
portals. Various levels of encryption that one agency would
follow but not another" (MED-RCMP, supervisor).
Individual unwillingness. The impediment ranked as the sec-
ond most significant barrier to information sharing was
"individual unwillingness," or a reluctance to share due to
personal attitudes, values, beliefs, and/or actions. In two of
the three organizations, the LRG-IND agency and the
MED-RCMP agency, one in five participants perceived
this as a problem, but in the MED-IND agency, the fre-
quency was one in three (34%), substantially more than
"process-technology."
8 SAGE Open
Comments made by several officers captured the larger
issue: " . . . empire building can protect and help many offi-
cers achieve their personal goals" (MED-IND, line officer);
"Individuals keeping information to themselves to act upon
themselves" (MED-IND, line officer); " . . . to beat out
everyone else" (LRG-IND, line officer); and "Holding
information gives me the `hero' factor. Meaning I will be the
officer writing the warrant and getting the credit" (LRG-
IND, line officer). These responses reflected rational self-
interest, marked by an emphasis on personal goals versus
collective priorities and interests, and influenced by their
agency's unique social and organizational context. Such
individual values and behaviors are not conducive to infor-
mation and knowledge sharing.
The issue of real or perceived competition between indi-
viduals was further illustrated by the comments by several
officers: " . . . internal competition and information hoard-
ing" (MED-IND, line officer), "Officer hoarding of informa-
tion and empire building" (LRG-IND, supervisor), and "The
individual silos of information and competition between
units" (MED-IND, command officer).
The degree to which this type of behavior was condoned
and/or rewarded within these organizations was of interest,
because individual unwillingness behaviors are contrary to
the fundamental policing goals of information sharing, inter-
operability, and achievement of organizational goals. Logic
dictates that at some point, individual unwillingness will
become organizational unwillingness if left unchecked,
because organizational culture is essentially a shared view

ceive, think, and feel . . . " (Schein, 2010).
Organizational unwillingness.
The third impediment to
sharing information most frequently identified was "organi-
zational unwillingness," manifested by a unit, department, or
agency level unwillingness to share information and knowl-
edge with other units or departments, internally and/or exter-
nally. Results showed that this impediment was perceived as
more common in the LRG-IND agency (16%) and the MED-
IND agency (15%) than in the MED-RCMP agency (10%).
Competition within a unit and/or department for notori-
ety, resources, or public recognition was shown in several
comments: "The individual silos of information and compe-
tition between units" (MED-IND, command officer);
"Boundaries between outside agencies . . . unwilling to share
information because they are competitive and seeking glory
within public perception" (MED-IND, line officer); and
"There is a sense that knowledge is power, and many do not
want to relinquish power. They are not special if others have
the info. From the executive level, there is a sense of `we
can't share info with the membership, the minions would not
understand'" (LRG-IND, line officer).
A recent study conducted by the RCMP examined police
information sharing practices in Canada. Findings indicated
that police relied heavily on personal interactions, relation-
ships, and trust-based information transactions when dealing
with sensitive information; that police trusted, overall, the
security of the technology systems that are in place; that out-
side access to individual agency information databanks was
very limited; and that a large portion of the sharing was built
on "personal initiative or judgement" and not on purely
"secure and systemic" information sharing protocols (LeBeuf
& Paré, 2005, p. 23). The foregoing comments from partici-
pants in the current study generally supported these findings,
particularly those statements that related to limited access to
outside agency databanks, information sharing was based on
trust, and that systemic information sharing protocols are
required.
Workload-information overload.The role that IT plays in
the facilitation of the storage, retrieval, and dissemination
of information and knowledge within the organization is
an important one. However, one of the unintended conse-
quences of that automation and re-arrangement of informa-
tion flows is an overabundance of information and a need for
the individual recipient to sort out what is important, what
can wait, and what can be ignored. This overabundance of
information, coupled with the need to sort and evaluate each
new item of information for relevancy, creates an increased
workload and/or overload for end-users of this automation. A
fourth impediment identified by participants was "workload-
information overload." This impediment was perceived as a
barrier to information sharing to a similar and more extensive
degree by the MED-IND agency (16%) and the MED-RCMP
agency (15%), whereas workload-information overload was
not perceived as a significant barrier to information and
knowledge sharing in the LRG-IND agency (2%). Supervi-
sors and line officers alike experienced this pressure: " . . .
time constraints, I don't have time in the day in order to
properly disseminate all the information" (RCMP, supervi-
sor); " . . . sharing information or knowledge often results in
more work" (RCMP, supervisor); " . . . information overload
through too many mediums" (LRG-IND, supervisor); and
"Time is a large factor, people are too busy. Motivation is
another due to workloads and limited time" (MED-IND, line
officer). All of these officers felt overloaded by information
and compelled to "do something" with information that they
acquired, whether it was to assess its worth, disseminate it,
record it, and/or take action.

The foregoing examples disclosed an issue of absorptive
capacity at the individual and collective organizational lev-
els.Absorptive capacity was defined by Cohen and Levinthal
(1990) as the ability to fully value, assimilate, and apply
new knowledge. Unless sufficient time and/or resources are
dedicated to mitigating information and work overload,
much information will be lost, overlooked, and/or ignored
to the detriment of the organization and the achievement of
target goals and outcomes. More importantly, the increased
workload caused by the massive influx of information
defeats the information sharing goal by creating disincen-
tives for officers to use and contribute to the information
systems and information flow. Because of this potential for
backlash, it is important that organizations develop appro-
priate structures that facilitate and do not hinder the flow of
communication between individuals, groups, units, and/or
organizations.
Location-structure. The fifth impediment mentioned by a sub-
stantial proportion of participants was "location-structure,"
which related to the way the organization is internally struc-
tured or generally located in the applicable policing area or
region. This was perceived as more of an issue by partici-
pants from the LRG-IND agency (14%) and the MED-IND
agency (13%), whereas fewer participants in the MED-
RCMP agency (8%) cited this factor as an impediment. The
following comments illustrated this information sharing
impediment succinctly: "The compartmentalization nature
of policing" (MED-IND, line officer); "Too large a service
and too spread out throughout the city to spread the informa-
tion throughout. Too many specialty units that are too spe-
cialized and retain their information because they are
segregated from the rest of the service" (LRG-IND, line offi-
cer); and " . . . too many different police agencies in a very
small geographic area" (MED-IND, supervisor).
Each of the foregoing comments identified the presence
of information "silos," which may be vertical within or hori-
zontal between units, sections, or agencies. This lack of com-
munication and information sharing within and across
organizations is aggravated by the location and structure of
organizational units, different roles and responsibilities,
accountabilities, budgets, and boundaries. Traditional
bureaucratically focused hierarchies do not always lend
themselves to substantive information sharing due to policies
and boundaries, however, there has been a greater recogni-
tion of the need for and value of increased informal contact
with peers and colleagues and the development of collabora-
tive network structures in the transferring of knowledge
within and across organizations (Agranoff & McGuire,
2004). A key role of leaders and managers in creating oppor-
tunities for knowledge sharing and integration within and
across organizations is to eliminate or reduce barriers that
produce physical or psychological distance (Argote,
McEvily, & Reagans, 2003).
Two additional impediments to information and knowl-
edge sharing that emerged in the responses from participants
were "leadership" (lack thereof) and "risk management."
Leadership.Leadership within organizations, positively or
negatively, drives the values, behaviors, commitment, and
cooperation of employees toward the achievement of a com-
mon goal. Relative to the other two agencies, the LRG-IND
agency stood out as more than 1 in 10 (13%) of the partici-
pants perceived that a lack of direction, feedback, or support
by the senior management or executive management team
was problematic. Illustrative of the perception that the lack
of leadership or management support were impediments
were these responses by officers: "Management failure to
take appropriate action unless the issue is topical, sexy or in
their individual political interest" (LRG-IND, supervisor);
" . . . lack of organization and direction. Confusion based on
who does what and what goes where due to a system top
heavy in bureaucracy" (RCMP, supervisor); and "lack of rec-
ognition" (LRG-IND, supervisor). In each of these instances,
the impediments to information and knowledge sharing can
be significantly addressed through the leadership function,
whether at the supervisory or at the senior management level.
In comparison, participants employed by the MED-RCMP
agency and the MED-IND agency perceived that leadership
issues with respect to information and knowledge sharing
were minimal or non-existent (3% and 0%, respectively).
Risk management. The final impediment identified was "risk
management," suggesting that information and knowledge
sharing was hindered by the overarching need for organiza-
tional or investigative level information and knowledge risk
management. This issue was slightly more predominant
within the LRG-IND agency (5%) than the MED-IND
agency (2%) and was perceived as a non-issue within the
MED-RCMP agency (0%).
Two issues of significance to policing were encompassed
by this theme: maintaining investigative integrity and limit-
ing agency liability in relation to lawsuits. Although there
were comparatively few responses within this category, the
responses reflected these concerns: "loose lips sink ships, if
you have an important investigation, only want the investi-
gating officers to know in order to complete invest without
hiccups" (LRG-IND, line officer); "may jeopardize a case"
(LRG-IND, line officer); and " . . . fear that the information
may get in the wrong hands" (LRG-IND, supervisor). Police
must, for legal and operational reasons, protect sensitive
investigative information and data from being inappropri-
ately collected, accessed, disclosed, copied, or destroyed. It
is within this legal and operational framework that police
must carefully consider, develop, and/or comply with data
sharing protocols to effectively work within the community-
policing, intelligence-led, problem-oriented, or Compstat-
based policing models.
Abrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 11
Within this policing context, it was unsurprising that this
theme emerged, but what was surprising was how infre-
quently this issue was identified as an impediment to infor-
mation and knowledge sharing within these three agencies,
possibly because this issue has been adequately addressed
through each of the agency's policies, procedures, and
culture.
Connecting Impediments to KM Infrastructures
To conceptualize and illustrate the connection between the
seven perceived information and knowledge impediments
and the three major organizational KM infrastructures, a dia-
gram was created using NVivo 8 software analysis. The three
organizational KM structures of technology, structure, and
culture are depicted in Figure 3.
This diagram revealed a clear pattern in these data
indicating, overall, that in this sample, the perceived
impediments to sharing information and knowledge fell
well-within the KM technical, cultural, and structural
infrastructure components of the three participating orga-
nizations. Some overlap was observed on issues that had
a technical and a structural component (e.g., email over-
load). Consideration of the themes in light of these three
infrastructures identified that although "processes-tech-
nology" was rated overall as the single highest ranking
impediment to sharing across the three organizations
(Figure 1), the three most substantial infrastructure
impediments to information sharing were "organizational
structure" (39%; n = 88) followed by "organizational cul-
ture" (33%; n = 75) and "processes-technology" (28%;
n = 63).
Discussion
Similarities Between KM in Policing and Other
Organizations
A recent study of obstacles to KM and information sharing
yielded a ranked list of the top 10 organizational impedi-
ments (Croteau & Dfouni, 2008). Although the rankings dif-
fered, six of the seven impediments identified within the
current study appeared on that list, namely, processes and
technology, individual unwillingness, organizational unwill-
ingness, workload-overload, location and structure, and lack
of leadership. A comparison of the findings is summarized in
Table 2.
This corroboration provided further validation of out-
comes of the thematic coding conducted in this study and
that there are commonalities between non-policing agencies
and police agency/organizations on this issue.
Organizational Context and Impact on
Information Behavior
Analysis of the perceived impediments to information and
knowledge sharing at the organizational level (Figure 2)
revealed unique differences between the three Canadian
policing agencies in terms of the magnitude and rankings of
the impediments. These organizational differences under-
scored the importance of context as a moderating factor
when examining extant KM practices within organizations.
For example, in their review of organizational information
environments, Detlor et al. (2006) suggested that an organi-
zation's technology systems, politics, and culture
Figure 3. Relationship between impediments and organizational infrastructure.
12 SAGE Open
. . . constrain and shape the degree to which people in
organizations can access, create, share, find, browse, create and
use information. That is, an organization's information
environment has a direct effect on both employee and
organizational information behavior. (p. 119)
This impact of culture on organizational context was
echoed by De Long and Fahey (2000):
By defining the context for interaction, culture determines how
all types of knowledge will be used in a particular situation. It
does this primarily by dictating the norms--the rules,
expectations, and penalties--that govern social interactions
between individuals and groups, and by shaping people's
perceptions of their range of options acceptable to the
organization. (p. 120)
The findings in the current study demonstrated how varia-
tions in organizational culture, structure, and technology can
affect the successful integration of information and knowl-
edge sharing within the three police organizations. These
findings were further substantiated in quantitative analyses
of additional data gathered regarding these organizations
(Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty,2013) demonstrating
that information quality control and proactive collaboration
accounted for 71% of the variance in a police organization's
ability to attain specific information use outcomes.
Limitations of the Study
This research highlighted important organizational informa-
tion and knowledge sharing issues and impediments within
three police organizations. However, these perceptions were
not necessarily representative of the larger police population
due to sample size and the tactical versus strategic focus of
the research question. Despite the limited samples, remark-
able consistencies and consensus emerged across these three
organizations with respect to the nature of the perceived
impediments to information and knowledge sharing and the
relative frequency or importance of each of these impedi-
ments (Figure 2). These outcomes indicated diffuse
informant reliability. Follow-up studies, conducted at the
tactical and strategic levels of the organization that include
civilian and sworn police personnel and intelligence special-
ists, will be required to corroborate or otherwise validate the
perceptions reported in this study by rank and file officers
within three Canadian police organization.
Policy and Practice Implications
This study isolated some of the information and knowledge
sharing barriers facing North American police organizations
at this point in their history and provided insights into the
sometimes fickle foundation on which all contemporary
policing is based: information and knowledge sharing. The
rank and file groups sampled form the bulk of personnel in
every police organization and, therefore, exert a direct and
indirect influence on all operations within those organiza-
tions and the achievement of any and all goals and outcomes
within the organization. In light of recent public sector
reforms to improve accountability, efficiency, and effective-
ness, it is surprising that little time has been devoted to
understanding this important, relevant, and influential group
in terms of their ability to support or impede organizational
decisions, actions, and outcomes through information and
knowledge sharing.
Singularly, the three most significant discrete impedi-
ments to information and knowledge sharing within all three
police organizations were processes and technology, indi-
vidual unwillingness, and organizational unwillingness.
Collectively, when specific impediments identified were
grouped within their associated organizational KM infra-
structures, the relative order of the issues changed. Most per-
ceived impediments were aspects of organizational structure
and organizational culture, not processes and technology.
Within the core information and knowledge sharing
impediments, a number of critical sub-themes emerged that
have implications for police policy and practice. Specifically,
these sub-themes identified negative consequences of infor-
mation silos, information hoarding, internal/external compe-
tition, personal versus collective goals, lack of absorptive

capacity, lack of incentives, existence of disincentives, and
lack of trust within and/or across units, sections, and agen-
cies. The practical implications of these issues on police
organizations cannot be underestimated. Table 3 itemizes
the organizational consequences of the presence of these
impediments.
In addition, no matter which individual model or combi-
nation of policing models each of the three participating
police agencies may ascribe (e.g., community-policing,
problem-oriented policing, intelligence-led policing, evi-
dence-based policing, reactive and/or proactive policing),
each of the impediments identified above conflict directly or
indirectly with contemporary police models either culturally,
technically, and/or structurally. For instance, a description of
the community policing partnership element as provided by
the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS; 2009)
states that,
Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve
publicsafetyproblemsalone,encouragesinteractivepartnerships
with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is
large and these partnerships can be used to accomplish the two
interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through
collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. (p. 5)
Using the impediments listed in Table 3 as a point of
departure, we see that the "interactive partnerships," "col-
laborative problem-solving," and "improving public trust"
elements of community policing cannot be truly realized
within a policing environment that is characterized by inter-
nal processes that impede information sharing, individual or
organizational unwillingness to share information or
knowledge, or lack of trust among others. Similarly, the
Intelligence-led policing model would be hampered by these
same information and knowledge sharing impediments.
The Intelligence-led policing model has developed sig-
nificantly over the past decade and is now conceptualized as
an integral part of the community-oriented policing and
problem-solving process, as was noted in a U.S. Department
of Justice report on intelligence-led policing:
Intelligence-led policing is a collaborative enterprise based on
improved intelligence operations and community-oriented
policing and problem solving, which the field has considered
beneficial for many considered beneficial for many years. To
implement intelligence-led policing, police organizations need to
re-evaluate their current policies and protocols. Intelligence must
be incorporated into the planning process to reflect community
problems and issues. Information sharing must become a policy,
not an informal practice. (Peterson, 2005, p. vii)
Once again, using Table 3 as reference, we see that any or
all of the negative information and knowledge sharing behav-
iors, values, and processes described by the sworn officers
within the three participating agencies would inhibit police
organizations' ability to effectively implement the intelli-
gence-led policing model. At the core of the intelligence-led
policing model is "collaboration" and "information sharing."
It is within this context that "information silos," poorly
designed "processes and technology," and/or "lack of absorp-
tive capacity," for example, fail to philosophically or practi-
cally support the intelligence-led policing model.
A review of the responses of the sworn officers from each
of the three policing organizations revealed that police

organizations, not unlike organizations in general, are highly
complex and adaptive social systems that can become mal-
adaptive and dysfunctional, if allowed, through lack of gov-
ernance, management, and effective learning (Andreadis,
2009; Matthews, Ryan, & Williams, 2011; Van Fleet &
Griffin, 2006). Many of the issues identified by the partici-
pants in this study are indeed rooted in lack of governance/
leadership, management, and/or effective learning. For the
sake of illustration, only a few of the many available exam-
ples are cited: processes and technology (lack of leadership
and management), individual unwillingness (lack of leader-
ship, management, effective learning), presence of disincen-
tives (lack of leadership, management, learning), and lack of
trust (lack of leadership, management, learning). Despite the
presence of a number of dysfunctional or otherwise maladap-
tive behaviors within these three police organizations, these
issues are not irreconcilable. Therefore, possible avenues for
policy and practice improvement are provided.
Conclusion
Each of the impediments identified represents an opportunity
for each organization to review and reflect on its current
information/knowledge sharing policies, practices, as well as
the culture and context in which these issues arose. Although
there is no prescriptive answer to solve all of the informa-
tion/sharing dilemmas within organizations, a number of
options are available to mitigate the impediments by improv-
ing coordination mechanisms and the context in which shar-
ing occurs. These options include, but are not limited to,
improve organizational identity and connectedness (Kogut &
Zander, 1996), align organizational culture with information
and knowledge sharing goals and needs (De Long & Fahey,
2000), develop information and knowledge sharing values
(Nonaka, 1994), create incentives for information and
knowledge sharing (Hung, Durcikova, Lai, & Lin, 2011),
promote boundary spanning (Tushman & Scanlan, 1981),
control information overload (Savolainen, 2007), and
improve levels of trust within and across units, sections, and
departments (Chowdhury, 2005; Willem & Buelens, 2007).
Such remediation efforts, however, fail to address one last
issue: paradoxes.
Earlier in our discussion of dialectics and its relation to
organizational learning, we proffered seven paradoxes:
secure and open, structured and flexible, individual and
group, conformity and diversity, innovation and stability,
certainty and risk, and loose and connected. Each of these
are germane to information and knowledge sharing within
North American policing as they represent potential sticking
points for polarized debate on issues that are actually inter-
dependent and inter-penetrating (Takeuchi & Nonaka,
2004). Simplifying the dialectic stages of thesis, antithesis,
and synthesis, each of the paradoxes presented essentially
create tensions between the two apparently opposing posi-
tions, which would necessitate discussion and debate within
the respective police organization. This eventual debate
would create a dynamic that incorporates aspects of the the-
sis (the first idea or position) and the antithesis (the second
idea or position), thus forming the synthesis or resolution,
which reveal themselves as new perspectives, patterns, atti-
tudes, or structures. This synthesis process is a learning pro-
cess. Thus, the paradox of secure and open suggests that
within the thesis of secure and the antithesis of open, there
is room for synthesis, where aspects of both concepts are
present while yet creating an opportunity for a new perspec-
tive, attitude, or structure. The same is true for each of the
six other paradoxes.
The foregoing insights into the information and knowl-
edge sharing barriers faced by the rank and file officers
within the participating agencies and the concepts of dialec-
tics and paradox will enable police leaders to better under-
stand the needs of their respective organizations and officers,
and better appreciate that information and knowledge shar-
ing cannot simply be accomplished through technology
alone. A more reflective, systematic, and engaged KM and
use approach that recognizes the linkage between the techni-
cal, cultural, and structural infrastructures must be under-
taken so that police organizations may achieve the goals
placed before them.
