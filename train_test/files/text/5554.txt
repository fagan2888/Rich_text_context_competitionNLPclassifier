Any institution of higher learning or business whose goals
are to survive and prosper in this present day diverse and
regressed economy has found it imperative to invest in ongo-
ing training and development to improve proficiencies in
production as well as to acquire the greatest return in invest-
ment of human capital (Knoke & Kalleberg, 1994).Although
this area of training effectiveness seems paramount, and
although training is an integral part of the employer­
employee relationship, Knoke and Kalleberg (1994) suggest
direct evidence about company training practices based on
representative samples of diverse employing organizations is
almost non-existent. Furthermore, several authors have sug-
gested that training is most extensive only in establishments
which operate in complex market environments (Rowden &
Conine, 2005; Sahinidis & Bouris, 2008). In addition, Row-
den and Conine (2005) indicate that there is limited research
on human resource development in small and midsized busi-
nesses. According to these authors, most people believe that
small businesses do little, if any, development of their work-
ers. Moreover, Rowden and Conine cite Training Magazine,
which annually conducts research on the training industry in
the United States, as not even attempting to contact busi-
nesses with fewer than 100 employees. In addition, in their
annual research sample, only 16% consisted of companies
between 100 and 500 workers. In general, little human
resource development occurs in small businesses (Hill &
Stewart, 1999). In summary, a slowly growing number of
authors are currently doing more research in the areas of
training and development and its effects on employees that
we have not seen in past literature.
Months of research failed to locate objective evidence in
support of connecting training and attitude, its impact on job
proficiencies, and the employee's perception that lack of
meaningful training directly affects proficiencies and atti-
tude. The objective of this study is to gather and provide
empirical data for training relationships that are not currently
available.
Cheng and Ho (2001) also discuss the importance of
training and its impact on job performance:
While employee performance is one of the crucial mea-
sures emphasized by the top management, employees
are more concerned about their own productivity and
are increasingly aware of the accelerated obsolescence
of knowledge and skills in their turbulent environment.
As the literature suggests, by effectively training and
developing employees, they will become more aligned
for career growth--career potential enhances personal
motivation. (p. 22)

The Effect of Training and Development
on Employee Attitude as it Relates
to Training and Work Proficiency
Debra L.Truitt1
Abstract
It is incumbent on training and development professionals to design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of their
programs in reducing disputes in workplace performance.This study explores the relationships between training experiences
and attitudes and attitudes about perceived job proficiency.In a sample of 237 full-time salaried/exempt and hourly/nonexempt
employees from one academic institution and three businesses in the states of Maryland, Delaware, and Arizona, the author
finds a direct relationship between one's positive training experiences and attitudes and one's proficiency. In this study, 86.8%
of those who had updated training had the most positive attitudes toward training ( = .293, p < .05). Furthermore, 80% of
those who had negative training attitudes also had negative views on their proficiency ( = .465, p < .000).

To illustrate Cheng and Ho's (2001) position, Constantino
and Merchant (1996) comment that "both training and educa-
tion are necessary components for a successful conflict man-
agement system " (p. 22). One might clearly imagine how
failure to provide training and education by the organization
could result in conflict between employer and employee.
Such conflict could potentially lead to any number of compli-
cated scenarios, including but not limited to formal com-
plaints by the employee which eventually become actual law
suits against the organization, all of which could cost the
industry time, energy, and money. When universities or busi-
nesses withhold opportunities for training and development,
they also fail to demonstrate an understanding of how to iden-
tify organizational conflict. According to these same authors,
all organizations should have a conflict management system
in place (Constantino & Merchant, 1996). When conflict is
manifested in the organization by clusters of employees who
are dissatisfied, this group dissatisfaction state of mind can
result in frenzied chaos, dissatisfaction, grievances, and tur-
moil in the organization. Again, having a conflict manage-
ment system in place would potentially be able to short circuit
such a disruptive process. Clearly, it is extremely important
that employees benefit from ongoing employer provided train-
ing. "One of the most frequently encountered human capital
development interventions is training" (Campbell & Kuncel,
2001, p. 278). To enhance job performance, training skills and
behaviors have to be transferred to the workplace, maintained
over time, and generalized across contexts (Holton & Baldwin,
2000). Consequently, specific job training is a complicated
matter and has been the focus of much of the training literature
(Chiaburu & Teklab, 2005). More specifically, in addition to
the exact nature of job training, training is seen as relevant to
fostering a positive relationship between learning satisfaction
and the effectiveness of applied learning (Liu, 2002; Wang,
2001). As an aside, even though authors have suggested that
training programs are vital to organizations (Knoke &
Kalleberg, 1994; Liu, 2002; Wang, 2001), training programs
are often the first to go (Young, 2008). This trend to cut train-
ing programs during poor economic times seems short-
sighted, if in fact, training does affect job proficiency and
relieves workplace conflict. The definition of results and
empirical data included in this study demonstrates that
employee do, in fact, perceive that training directly effects
job proficiency is an indicator which many employers inter-
ested in sound business management and growth in the mar-
ketplace should subscribe to initiating and maintaining
offerings of soft skill (leadership, effective communica-
tions, and coaching) and technical proficiency training.
Moreover, several authors have also written about the
importance of staff development. Both formal and informal
training opportunities are thought to provide a forum for the
development of talent. When talent is fostered and nur-
tured, competitive advantages in performance are untainted
(Becker & Gerhard, 1996; Bowling, 2007; Davenport, 2006;
Peters & Waterman, 1982). Furthermore, the organizational
commitment or "the relative strength of an individual's iden-
tification and involvement in a particular organization"
(Pool & Pool, 2007, p. 353) depends on effective training and
development programs.According to these authors, organiza-
tions demonstrating keen insight make provisions for satis-
fying the training needs of their current workforce. Cheng
and Ho (2001) indicate that adequate training produces
marked improvements in employee communication and pro-
ficiency of performances as well as extending retention time.
Moreover, when programs target communication skills with
coworkers, there are significant increases in profit as well as
a greater number of reported positive working relationships
that are formed. Employees with good communication skills
gather more information concerning procedures and tech-
nologies related to job performances, thus assuming greater
accountability and subsequent responsibility, both of which
effect improve proficiency (Adams, 1989; Gordon, 1977).
Also, training and education have been shown to have a sig-
nificant positive effect on job involvement, job satisfaction,
and organizational commitment (Karia & Asaari, 2006).
Similarly, Ahmad and Karia (n.d.) have emphasized the
relationship between training and attitude as it relates to
working with others. Employees with positive attitudes
become stakeholders in the process and job accomplishment
is of a higher priority. Furthermore, successful organizations
achieve a partnership between workers and management.
The partnership includes participation in teamwork activities
and continuous learning application. The reported findings
further suggest that an employee's participation in decision
making and problem solving develops organizational trust
(Anschutz, 1995).
Corporations and businesses need to grow and innovate
continuously, pursue sustained development, and cope with
rapid changes in their external environments as well as
increasingly competitive international markets. Hence, orga-
nizations need to strengthen or expand the knowledge base,
skills, and abilities of their employees. For this purpose, edu-
cation and training must be incorporated into a systematic
and formal system if the goals of employees and corporation
are to be attained (Liu, 2002; McGehee & Thayer, 1961).
Training, as defined in the present study "is the planned
intervention that is designed to enhance the determinants of
individual job performance" (Chiaburu &Teklab, 2005).
Training is related to the skills an employee must acquire to
improve the probability of achieving the organization's over-
all business and academic goals and objectives. Positive
training offered to employees may assist with reduction of
anxiety or frustration, which most employees have experi-
enced on more than one occasion during their employment
careers (Cheng & Ho, 2001).
According to Tsai, Yen, Huang, and Huang (2007),
employees who are committed to learning showed a higher
level of job satisfaction that has a positive effect on their
performance. Moreover, Locke defined job satisfaction as a
pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from a
Truitt 3
positive appraisal of the job or job experiences (Locke,
1976). The literature suggests that commitment results from
adequate training and development for successful job com-
pletion and an increase in job performance (Tsai et al., 2007).
In addition, the larger the gap between the skills required
to perform a task and the actual skills available for perform-
ing a task, the greater the lack of job satisfaction and the
greater the increase in employee turnover within the organi-
zation. Conversely then, not having the skills to perform a
job correctly can set up employees for failure and put the
business at a less-than-competitive disadvantage. The result-
ing high turnover would predict the need for even more
training that would then have a direct impact on the bottom
line of any business.
Moreover, poor performance reviews due to inadequate
job training can produce employee dissatisfaction and con-
flict. Although there is no direct link in the literature between
training and job satisfaction, Rowden and Shamsuddin
(2000) and Rowden and Conine (2005) argue that the most
thoroughly trained employees will better satisfy the needs of
their customers and employees.
In summary, although the literature strongly suggests a
direct relationship between job training and job perfor-
mance as well as job training and employee attitudes, there
is little empirical support for this suggestion. Clearly, there
is a need to provide such empirical support. The purpose of
the present study was to explore the relationship between
training and development and its perceived impact on
employee attitudes and perceived job performance profi-
ciencies. The empirical data suggest a perceived gap by the
employees between training attitudes and job proficien-
cies. This gap could then result in conflict between the
employee and employer relationship. The present study
elaborates and extends previous research by exploring par-
ticipant attitudes in an academic institution as well as in
three businesses, one of which is a small-to-moderate size
business that is usually overlooked in other research stud-
ies. The hypotheses in this study specifically address the
relationship between employees with training experiences
who have positive attitudes about training (training atti-
tudes), and those positive training attitudes are perceived
to improve job proficiency.
Method
Procedures
Using convenience sampling, four organizations were
recruited through personal contacts with business profession-
als, including one university and three for-profit businesses.
Participation by the academic institution was approved by the
Director of Human Resources. The approving and granting
authority for the companies was respectively the Director of
Operations, Executive Advisory Board Committee, and
President.
The strategy behind the choice of this particular target
population was to determine cultural variations between aca-
demic and for-profit businesses by assessing attitudinal dif-
ferences in relation to training and development and by
comparing the result of these assessments. The exempt/
salary and nonexempt/hourly staff at the academic institu-
tion was selected based on past history of training and devel-
opment if the Human Resources Department had offered
training opportunities. The university's Human Resource
Department provided the primary investigator a list of all
exempt/salary and nonexempt/hourly employees. A survey
developed by the primary investigator, along with other sup-
porting documents, was sent to each employee on the list.
Each company that was contacted also reported ongoing
training initiatives and offerings similar to those offered by the
academic institution in the past. The participants representing
the three companies were determined by their availability and
willingness to volunteer to participate in the survey. In accor-
dance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Committee,
participant anonymity was maintained.
Participants were provided a packet containing a partici-
pant instruction sheet, a risks/benefits analysis sheet, a disclo-
sure form, a consent form, a survey form, and a self-addressed,
stamped envelope addressed to the primary investigator.
Once data were returned to the primary investigator, all
consent forms were separated from the original survey, placed
in a designated folder, and locked in a file cabinet housed in
the primary investigator's locked office. All returned surveys
were coded and the results entered into a statistical system
package (PASW). All data had been run and completed, and
the results of the surveys are made available on request.
The initial sample for this study totaled 487 full-time
exempt/salaried and nonexempt/hourly employees. The total
number of surveys returned was 237, yielding a response rate
of 48.6%. Each participating business had ongoing training
initiatives and offerings similar to those of the academic
institution. All participants for this study were selected based
on their availability and willingness to participate. No com-
pensation was given in exchange for participation. This
study was approved by the university's Institutional Review
Board (IRB; see Appendix A)
The sampled organizations include a university in Maryland
with 380 exempt and nonexempt employees, an Arizona
Corporation's subdivision of 50 employees, a Delaware
company's department with 34 employees, and a Maryland
Corporation with 60 employees. Random sampling tech-
niques were employed to arrive at a representative sample of
each division of interest.
Survey Development andTesting
The survey for this study was created by the author as part
of a graduate course requirement. The survey was composed
of 20 items, 16 of which were rated on a 4-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 1= fully disagree to 4 = fully agree. Three
4 SAGE Open
remaining items were demographic information (gender,
age, and job status). The final item was an open-ended ques-
tion that asked participates about preferred training proto-
cols. This final item was analyzed separately and did not
directly address the hypotheses.
Two different reliability measures were generated to test
the survey instrument used for this research. A Cronbach's
alpha test of reliability was used to establish the internal reli-
ability of the scaled variables as a whole. The Cronbach's
alpha score derived was .915 (see Table 1), surpassing the
minimum of .70 recommended by Nunnally (1978).
Asecond reliability measure called the Guttman Split-Half
Reliability Coefficient Statistic was computed to assure reli-
ability of the scale items. The test is designed to compare the
items in the first half of the scale with the items in the second
half of the scale. The obtained Guttman value was .815, sug-
gesting strong reliability of the instrument (see Table 1).
Instrument validity tests were conducted using experts and
hypotheses testing. A psychologist, human resources repre-
sentative, business vice president, and business employee
reviewed the survey to establish face validity. All four agreed
that the questions on the survey appeared to measure what
they were intended to measure. Construct validity using
hypothesis testing assesses the correspondence between
the concept itself and the empirical indicators of the con-
cept. Concurrent validity also uses hypothesis testing to show
differences between groups about whom we know differences
exist. Each of the hypotheses below was tested using chi-
square and gamma statistical procedures.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Those employees with training
experiences have positive attitudes about training
(training attitudes).
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Positive training attitudes are per-
ceived to improve job proficiency.
Data Overview

bution between the four groups that participated in this
study. The largest participating group in this study was
composed of the university in Maryland with a 56.22%
response rate. The second participating group in this study
was the Maryland Corporation with a response rate of 15.02%.
The third participating group of this study was the Delaware
Division with a response rate of 14.59%, and the last par-
ticipating group of this study was the Arizona Corporation
with a 14.59% response rate (see Figure 2).
IndependentVariables
To best discover demographic factors that may affect one's
training attitudes and perceptions on job proficiency, it is
necessary to look at whether or not gender, work status, and
type of business are related to the dependent variables.
In addition, several single survey items were identified as
potentially affecting one's views on perceived job profi-
ciency. These are the following: Updated Training--Item 6
on survey instrument, Effective Coaching--Item 8,
Meaningful Coaching--Item 9, Solicits Input--Item 12.
Training Attitudes is a scale created using Questions 1 to 5
on the survey instrument (see items listed below).
Question 1: Effective Tools--On-the-job training is an
effective tool for learning new skills.
Question 2: Communications--Developmental train-
ing should include effective communications, team
building, and coaching.
Question 3: Levels--Development training should be
afforded to all levels and/or positions.
Question 4: Growth and Advancement--Training and
development is important for job growth.
Question 5: Advancement--Training and develop-
ment is important for potential advancement.
DependentVariables
The following two variables, training attitudes and profi-
ciency, that are described above were identified in the
hypotheses as the dependent variables in this study.
Proficiency is also a scale using Items 6, 8, 9, and 12 from
the survey.
Question 6: Updated Training--I receive updated
training which is required for my position.
Question 8: Adequate Training--My supervisor con-
ducts effective coaching sessions with me.
Question 9: Meaningful Coaching--My coaching ses-
sions are meaningful and motivational.
Question 12: Solicits Input--My supervisor solicits
my input on issues and opportunities.
In terms of construct validity, the results of Tables 4 and 5
suggest that the concepts (training attitudes and perceived
job proficiency) do in fact measure what they are intended
to measure.
Table 4 on updated training by training attitudes has a
moderately strong gamma score of .293 that is statistically
significant at p < .05 (H1).

Table 5 on training attitudes and perceived job proficiency
also has a moderate gamma of .465 with a p < .000 (H2).
Both tables also provide evidence for achieving concur-
rent validity. In H1, it was expected that those with more
updated training would favorably view more training. (See
Table 4 to confirm this and see details above.)
H2 predicted that those with strong positive attitudes
toward training would also have greater perceived job profi-
ciency. This was confirmed in Table 5 (see details above).
Results
Analysis of gender by training attitudes, work status by pro-
ficiency, and business by proficiency were computed. In
Table 6, gender by training attitudes resulted in the finding
that women (73.6%) had significantly greater positive train-
ing attitudes than did men (60.0%) with 2 = 6.519, df = 2,
p < .05. The results of the work status by proficiency (see
Table 7) resulted in the findings that 25.6% of nonexempt/

hourly employees disagreed that they received adequate job
training compared with 12.4% of the exempt/salaried
employees (2 = 6.310, df = 2, p < .05). The results of the
business by proficiency (see Table 8) showed that the
Delaware Division (71.9%) compared with Arizona
Corporation (31.2%) and the Maryland Corporation (53.3%)
had significantly more participants who often agreed that
training provided enhanced job proficiency (2 = 20.757, df
= 6, p < .005).
Gamma tests assessing the strength of the association of
the cross-tabulated data between the following eight com-
parisons were measured: updated training by training atti-
tudes, updated training by job proficiency, effective coaching
by job proficiency, meaningful coaching by job proficiency,
meaningful coaching by training attitudes, solicits input by
job proficiency, solicits input training attitudes cross-tabulation,
and training attitudes proficiency cross-tabulations.
Table 4 shows the relationship between updated training
and training attitudes of those who were fully updated on
training, 86.8%, had positive training attitudes compared to
only 65.06% of those who disagreed with being up-to-date
on training. Gamma = .293, p < .05 reveals that there is a
moderate, significant relationship between the variables.
The cross-tab of updated training by proficiency shows
(see Table 9) a significant and high strength of association
between updated training and proficiency. In all, 83.3% fully
disagreed that they had updated training and disagreed that
they are proficient, compared with the 7.7% that fully agreed
to having updated training and disagreed to being proficient.
This shows a significant and strong relationship between
updated training and proficiency ( = .592, p < .000).
Table 10 shows that 71.4% of those who fully agree that
they had effective coaching also fully agree that they feel pro-
ficient compared with 13.0% who fully disagreed that they
had effective coaching. This shows a high and significant cor-
relation between effective coaching variables and effective
coaching ( = .619, p < .000).
The cross-tab between meaningful coaching by profi-
ciency (see Table 11) reveals that 88.9% fully agree they had
meaningful coaching and also fully agree that they felt profi-
cient compared with 6.7% who fully disagreed that they had
meaningful coaching and fully agreed that they were job pro-
ficient. This shows a very strong significant relationship
between meaningful coaching and perceived job proficiency
( = .728, p < .000).
Table 12 shows that those who fully agreed that they had
meaningful coaching (94.1%) also revealed experienced
positive training attitudes compared with 64.9% of those
who disagreed to experiencing meaningful coaching, yet had
positive training attitudes, which reveals a moderate and sig-
nificant relationship (y = .252, p < .10).
Table 13 of solicits input by proficiency demonstrates that
82.4% fully disagreed that their supervisor solicits input from
them which lead to less agreement (disagree) on proficiency

compared with 1.6% who fully agreed that supervisors solic-
ited their input and disagree that it positively impacted on
proficiency. This shows a significant and very strong relation-
ship between bosses who do not solicit input and employees
who do not feel proficient ( = .845, p < .000).
The cross-tab of solicits input and training attitudes (see
Table 14) reveals that 83.1% fully agreed that having supervi-
sors solicit input effects training attitudes. Moreover, 52.9%
who fully disagreed with solicits input, however, fully agreed
that it impacts on training attitudes. This shows a moderate
and significant relationship between employers who solicit
input and employee attitude about training ( = .344, p < .005).
The training attitudes and perceived proficiency cross-tab
(see Table 5) showed that 80.0% disagreed that they feel
positive about training and also disagreed that they feel pro-
ficient compared with 13.9% who fully agreed that training
was positive and disagreed that they felt proficient. The rela-
tionship between training attitude and perceived proficiency
showed a moderate and significant correlation ( = .465, p <
.000; see Table 5).
The final analysis analyzed the responses to the open-
ended question that solicited requests for potential training
topics. A total of 87 participants (22.89% of the total sample)
answered the open-ended question: "I would like to have the
following training offered." Common themes were soft skill
(i.e., leadership, effective communication, mentoring, etc.)
and technological training. Out of 87 responses, 47
participants (54%) requested more soft skill training such as
leadership, effective communications, and mentoring. A
total of 36 participants (41.3%) requested more technological
training such as computer programming and software applica-
tions. Two participants (2.29%) responded as not having the
available time for training due to budget cuts/constraints.
One participant (1.14%) requested "any form of training,"
and 1 (1.14%) participant indicated the need for more "real-
world" training. Some participants provided more than one
response and others did not indicate a preference, so the per-
centages will not add up to 100%.
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the first
hypothesis, those employees with training experiences have
positive attitudes about training (training attitudes), and the
second hypothesis, positive training attitudes are perceived
to improve job proficiency. The results of this study support
the hypotheses. The gamma calculations found strong sig-
nificant associations between those employees who fully
agreed that they had updated training and subsequent posi-
tive training attitudes, as well a feeling of increased job
proficiency. The results also showed that those employees
who fully agreed that they received effective coaching and
those who fully agreed they received meaningful coaching
felt they demonstrated an increase in job proficiency.

These results agree with those of Becker and Gerhard,
(1996), Bowling (2007), and Davenport (2006), who also
suggest that the quality of training has a lot to do with
employee's feelings of importance concerning the job.
The results of the questionnaire demonstrated a strong
and significant relationship between bosses. This finding
also supports the literature that discusses the impact of job
training on psychological variables such as motivation and
commitment (Cheng & Ho, 2001; Liu, 2002; Pool & Pool,
2007; Wang, 2001), organizational trust (Anschutz, 1995),
and willingness to go above and beyond to meet their job
requirements (Rowden & Conine, 2005).
Although this study did not directly assess organizational
"conflict," it seems clear that because training is seen to be
so important in forming positive attitudes that it may further
lead to job proficiency, and not receiving adequate training is
associated with a feeling of reduced competency, it seems
very reasonable to predict that poor training could result in
poor attitudes about performance, which then could lead to
poor performance. This finding opens up employees to an
entire set of potential consequences; one such consequence
is conflict in the workplace environment. Other conse-
quences could include poor performance review, lack of
organizational trust (because the employee feels unfairly
evaluated due to not receiving adequate training for job func-
tions), and the beginning of a downhill spiral leading to
possible termination and subsequent loss of resources for the
organization.
Clearly, where job training is concerned, poor fits between
employee and the job/organization may result in eventual
performance gaps (Harrison, 2005) emphasizing the need for
conflict management systems to be in place at all levels of
the organization.
Surprisingly, the research did not find significant dif-
ferences in attitudes between the younger and older
employees. However, the research did find significant dif-
ferences between men and women with respect to overall
positive training attitudes. Women, significantly more often
than men, indicated positive attitudes toward training. It
was not known if these results suggest that women felt that
training is more beneficial because of the technical nature
of current job demands being placed on women(who may
not feel prepared for these demands), or if women are more
supportive in general of extra educational offerings than
are men. Future research may address this gender-related
disparity when developing future training programs.
Although exempt/salary and the nonexempt/hourly
employees fully agreed that training was related to job profi-
ciency, when they disagreed, they significantly disagreed.
Specifically, nonexempt/hourly employees disagreed more
strongly that attitudes were related to job proficiency.
Although an interesting finding, more interesting is the

finding that both groups fully agreed at equal levels that atti-
tudes were related to job proficiency, again supporting the
original hypotheses.
The finding that the Delaware Division significantly more
often agreed that attitude leads to proficiency than did the
other three organizations may be explained by the fact that
those employees had just completed a job training, which
may have affected their position.
Interestingly, in Table 8, the highest fully agreed ratings
that attitudes affect proficiency come from the university in
Maryland and the Arizona Corporation. This author was told
that in the Arizona Corporation, job training occurs very
regularly, and for the first three probationary years, employ-
ees are expected to pass proficiency tests following each
training session to stay employed with the company. An
excellent study for future research might investigate whether
job training requiring passing proficiency tests as a condition
of employment is more valuable than training without the
conditional testing criteria.
In summary, this author researched the hypotheses that
adequate job training is related to positive attitudes about job
proficiency and that having adequate job training is related
to positive attitudes about job training. The results have sup-
ported the hypotheses. However, given the nature of the
research, there are several limitations to this study.
Survey research has many problems associated with its
use. Surveys are self-reported instruments and, as such, may
not be completely valid or reliable. However, it can be
reported that a strong internal consistency of the instrument
was confirmed by using both Cronbach's alpha and
Guttman's split-half coefficient. Both of these measures pro-
vide reliability information when instruments use formats
that generate ordinal data.
A major limitation to the interpretation of the results has
to do with the instrument (see Appendix B). A close exami-
nation of Appendix B shows the direction provided between
Questions 5 and 6, "If you have not had training, please skip
Questions 6-12." This directive probably should not have
been included on this questionnaire because it may have
eliminated all those respondents who have never been
trained, leaving only respondents who have had some train-
ing, effective and ineffective, meaningful and nonmeaning-
ful. Given that industry trains very often, and given that the
return rate for the three for-profit organizations was 100%,
the missing data came from the Maryland university sam-
ple. Only 130 questionnaires out of 380 were returned from
the Maryland University. Omitting this directive may have
extended the sample from those who had some type of train-
ing to include a category for those who had never received
training, making the comparison more meaningful. Based
on the present finding, one may never know how those
"never having training" felt about their competence.
Moreover, it may have been better to have used a true
7-point Likert-type scale, allowing the author to make finer
discriminations in the findings.
In addition, the survey could have included more useful
demographic information questions as well as questions
related to conflict. Specifically, respondents could have been
asked if they felt they received the right amount of training,
and if that having the right amount of training ever resulted
in a negative performance consequences. Respondents could
also have been asked questions related to how conflict is
mediated in their workplace and how important it was to
them to have an actual conflict management system in place
in their place of work.
Even though the study could have been methodologically
improved in several ways, it is still important to state that
this study is one of only a few attempting empirically to
answer questions related to the importance of job training.
Furthermore, this study is also a first attempt at trying to
assess the real importance of job training to the employee
and the far-reaching complications of the ensuing conflict in
our present day work environments where the employee
perceives that meaningful job training is unavailable. Chris
Young of Rainmaker Group, Inc. has noted that the "training
and development budget is often the first to go and the last
to come back" (Young, 2008). Organizations undergoing
fiscal challenges may target employee training as the first
cost-cutting measure. If we follow the collective wisdom of
successful businesses, conflict management system pro-
fessionals, and the results of this empirical research, one
must conclude that effective and ongoing training and
development should be the final cost-cutting measure.
Training and its positive effects on employee attitude and
proficiencies create long-lasting stakeholders and could
serve as the binding force for business success during trou-
ble times.
When understanding the connection between employee
attitudes about competence and potential organizational con-
flict, a conflict management system may be the first line of
defense to assess and assist in the analysis of the fits and
gaps when dealing with the organizational culture of attitude
and training.
Cheng and Ho (2001) claim that as a result, "ungraded"
employees look for improving their job performance as well
as enhancing their future career prospects. Obviously, when
employees transfer their positive learning content to their
job, a win­win solution for organizations and employees can
be accomplished. Therefore, when employees are provided
better and more intensive training, the result is an increase in
self-worth and greater job performance proficiency. If the
employee's perception is one of having sufficient training
and development, it may also serve as a catalyst for enhanc-
ing the employee teaming effect.

Future research could build on this study's results by
measuring quantitatively the actual increases in job perfor-
mance as well as the actual changes in job proficiency atti-
tudes.This could be accomplished in a simple pretest­posttest
design using a control group not having had the training as a
comparison group. It would be valuable to connect percep-
tion to actual changes in job performance that can be quanti-
fied and measured. Attitude studies like this one are limited
to representing what the person would be feeling should he
or she be in that position, or try to recall what he or she felt
when she actually was in that position. More actual behav-
ioral data of this nature might convince upper level manage-
ment to invest in employee development programs. It is
important for employers to provide relevant and meaningful
training for the employees, which supports and enhances
employee attitude. When training is perceived by the
employee to be relevant and meaningful, the results may be
demonstrated through improved proficiencies.
When examining the open-ended question on the survey
that asked about preferred training programs to be offered,
most responders requested training on soft skills, such as
leadership, values, effective communications, and so on, and
technology training such as, computer literacy, computer
updated software programs, and so on. These results of the
open-ended question strengthen our position that employees
require and desire training that will make them competitive
in this highly demanding market.
The present survey was conducted to assess a relationship
between attitudes about training and perceived subsequent
job proficiency. The data that were collected supported our
hypotheses that job training is correlated with positive feel-
ings about job training and that positive job training predicts
positive attitudes about job proficiency. Limitations to this
study have been considered and suggestions for future
research have been provided. Clearly, empirical research in
the area of expected job training and resulted job proficiency
and potential organizational conflict is only in its infancy.
This study has been an important first step in this line of
research.
