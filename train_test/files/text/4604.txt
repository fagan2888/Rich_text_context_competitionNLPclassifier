Abstract
Sexual responses are thought to be controlled by a brain module called the sexual module. Sexual strategies of males and females
vary to a great extent, and sexual responses of males and females may be affected by their sexual strategies. However, the current
view of the sexual module is that of a unisex module. This might be questionable since brain modules are defined as evolved
cognitive mechanisms to solve adaptive problems which are different for males and females. We hypothesize that the sexual
module responds differently in the presence of complex (high-order) contextual cues that are related to gender-dimorphic sexual
strategies in males and females.
We conducted a priming experiment in which stimuli related to sexual strategies were disentangled from their sexual meaning.
Nonsexual priming pictures related to either economic resources or social interactions preceded a sexual-target picture in order
to test whether the primes were able to modulate the subjective sexual response to the sexual target. In a control condition,
priming pictures without relation to mating preferences but with similar emotional impact were presented. In males, sexual
responses were similar in the experimental and control conditions. In females, however, primes related to economic resources or
social interactions modulated sexual arousal significantly more than the control primes. Our findings suggest that brain modules
dedicated to process the experimental primes were functionally connected with the sexual module in females more than in males,
making females' sexual responses more prone to the impact of high-order cultural cues than males' sexual responses. A gender-
dimorphic connectivity of the sexual module may be the way in which gender-dimorphic sexual strategies are implemented in the
human mind.

Parental investment theory states that in species with
sex-specific differences in obligatory parental investment, the
higher investing sex (typically the female) will be more selec-
tive in its choice of mating partners (Trivers, 1972). If in these
species males sometimes contribute resources to offspring,
females' selection will be based in part on the ability and
willingness of males to invest in their offspring (Buss &
Schmitt, 1993). Accordingly, in humans, sexual strategies are
found to differ between sexes to a great extent, with females
showing a higher preference than males for mates who possess
resources and are willing and interested in investing
in children, and males showing a higher preference for physi-
cally attractive and young mates than females (Brase, 2006;
Conroy-Beam, Buss, Pham, & Shackelford, 2015; Janssen &
Bancroft, 2007; N. P. Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsenmeier,
2002; Roney, Hanson, Durante, & Maestripieri, 2006).
Furthermore, women are repeatedly found to be less prone to

2011; Schmitt, 2005; Voracek, Hofhansl, & Fisher, 2005).
Female-typical choosiness is an adaptation to sex-typical
selection forces.
At the level of individual brain function, sexual behavior is
controlled by an evolved cognitive mechanism, the sexual
module (Spiering & Everaerd, 2007). Several studies showed
a functionally specialized, automatic, and adaptive processing
of sexual stimuli (Both et al., 2008; Gillath, Mikulincer, Birn-
baum, & Shaver, 2007; Janssen, Everaerd, Spiering, & Janssen,
2000; Ponseti & Bosinski, 2010; Spiering, Everaerd, Karsdorp,
Both, & Brauer, 2006), which is in accordance with the concept
of an evolved cognitive mechanism (Barrett & Kurzban, 2006;
Carruthers, 2006; Fodor, 1983; Sperber, 2005). In the follow-
ing, we will shortly describe how sex research currently
describes at a proximate level the functioning of the sexual
module and what, from an evolutionary psychology point of
view, is missing in that model.
Consistently, influential models of sexual stimulus process-
ing assume that an internal representation of a (potentially
sexual) stimulus undergoes several stages of pattern recogni-
tion (Janssen et al., 2000; Spiering & Everaerd, 2007; Stoleru,
Fonteille, Cornelis, Joyal, & Moulier, 2012). Essentially, this
process is seen as a stimulus-driven process (bottom-up). How-
ever, any type of meaning cannot be activated unless the sti-
mulus representation matches a memory code. So far, some
type of top-down processing has always been assumed when
meaningful stimulus processing takes place. Memory codes
can represent either explicit knowledge or implicit knowledge
such as response tendencies. Successful matching between
encoded stimulus representations and memory codes is also
referred to as stimulus appraisal. If the activated memory codes
are "sexual," sexual responses are activated. Generally, sexual
responses comprise motivational, emotional, and autonomic
(genital and endocrine) aspects.
The current theory of a sexual module is an important
achievement for various reasons: First, it comprises descrip-
tions of stimulus processing that are in accordance with basic
theories of emotional processing (LeDoux, 1996; O
¨ hman,
Flykt, & Lundqvist, 2000); second, it is compatible with
detailed neurofunctional (Georgiadis & Kringelbach, 2012;
Stoleru et al., 2012) and neuroendocrine characterizations
(Pfaus, 2009); and third, it acknowledges its evolutionary foun-
dation. However, the multiplicity of sex-dimorphic responses,
behaviors, and preferences in the realm of mating is not
accounted for in the current characterization of the sexual mod-
ule. This appears to be a theoretical contradiction, or at least a
major gap, given that a sexual module is assumed to solve
adaptive problems of reproduction that are of course different
for males and females. Thus, it is questionable whether males
and females process sexual stimuli by means of a unisex sexual
module.
To be more specific, particularly in females, the sexual
attractiveness of a potential mate can be altered by additional
information regarding his status or his fondness for children
(Dunn & Searle, 2010; La Cerra, 1995; Townsend & Levy,
1990) or by the potential risk of male­female aggression
(Y. Li et al., 2014). Females' attitudes toward sexual stimuli
can even be altered by a context of luxuriousness (Vohs,
Sengupta, & Dahl, 2014). With regard to sexual stimulus
processing, these examples suggest (1) that the sexual salience
of a stimulus can be modulated by complex contextual cues and
(2) that this modulation can be influenced by the sexual stra-
tegies of the observer. Neither of these assumptions is
accounted for by the current view of the sexual module. And
in fact, these assumptions are not easy to reconcile with the
conceptualization of brain modules, in particular with the
assumptions of domain specificity and encapsulation (i.e., its
relative imperviousness to cognitive control). If the sexual
module is activated preferentially by sexual stimuli, sexual
stimulus processing (including response generation) should run
relatively independently of contextual stimuli. Similarly, a
snake might trigger more or less the same fear response inde-
pendently of whether a person is confronted with the snake in a
forest or in a modern shopping mall. One possibility to recon-
cile the contextual modulation of (female) sexual responses
with the assumption of an evolutionary-shaped sexual module
could be to assume that the processing of the sexual module is
somehow modulated by the processing of other brain modules,
for instance, modules dedicated to object recognition or social
processing. The impact of other brain modules on the sexual
module could be realized by varying, and possibly
sex-dimorphic, degrees of connectivity.
In order to better understand the functioning of the sexual
module in regard to sexual strategies, we wanted to test two
assumptions: First, that sexual responses can be modulated by
nonsexual contextual cues, and second, that such a modulation
can be sex dimorphic. To this end, we disentangled cues that
are relevant for mating preferences from sexual meaning and
tested their impact on sexual stimuli by means of a priming
experiment. We used pictures depicting either abundant
resources (economic primes positive [EPþ]) or a lack of
resources (EPÀ) as priming stimuli to test whether the response
to a subsequent sexual-target picture could be modulated. Simi-
larly, we tested the impact of priming pictures that showed
either opposite-sex adults who were friendly looking or care-
taking toward children (social primes [SPþ]) or aggressive
looking or aggressive behaving (social primes negative [SPÀ])
on the response to sexual-target pictures. For females, the facial
expression of an adult male has been found to be a proxy for his
fondness for children (Roney et al., 2006).
We expected the priming pictures to modulate the response
to the sexual-target pictures in females more than in males
because we assumed that a positive economic or social context
would trigger functional connections to the sexual module of
females in particular. However, emotionally positively valued
circumstances might enhance sexual response independently
from evolutionary-selected, sex-dimorphic mating preferences
simply because a positive mood might be more compatible
with a sexual response than a negative mood (Klauer & Musch,
2003). To control for such unspecific priming effects, we addi-
tionally used priming stimuli without the social or economic

in terms of emotional valence and arousal.
Material and Method
Stimulus Preparation
For each of the four priming conditions, 21 colored images
were preselected by the experimenters: (1) pictures indicating
an abundance of resources, such as expensive houses, expen-
sive cars, and jewelery (EPþ); (2) pictures indicating a short-
age of resources, such as barracks, humble furniture, and
broken cars (EPÀ), with no persons visible in either the EPþ
or EPÀ images; (3) pictures depicting either one friendly
looking or caretaking adult or two (male and female) friendly
looking or friendly behaving adults (sometimes taking care of
a child; SPþ, social primes positive); and (4) pictures depict-
ing either one aggressive-looking or -shouting adult or two
adults (male and female) fighting or aggressively shouting
(sometimes with a child visible; SPÀ). None of the (21 Â
4 ¼) 84 images of the four priming conditions displayed any
sexual content.
Although most of the images were used equally for male and
female participants in the main experiment, some images var-
ied according to the gender of the participant. In pictures in
which only one adult was visible (in the SPþ or the SPÀ
condition), participants were exposed to images of an
opposite-sex adult. In some images of the SPÀ condition that
displayed fighting adults, one adult was depicted as the aggres-
sor while the other appeared rather as the victim of the aggres-
sion. In these cases, participants in the main experiment were
exposed to images with an opposite-sex aggressor and same-
sex victim. While all images in the EPÀ condition were iden-
tical for male and female participants, five of the EPþ images
were different for the male and female participants (showing in
these cases gender-typical luxuries--e.g., shop for expensive
clothes for women or shop for expensive clothes for men,
respectively). Taken together, a male and female stimulus set
of 84 priming stimuli was used, which was largely identical
and, in those cases where it was not identical, it was analogous.
Thirty-one males rated the 84 images of the four priming
conditions (male set) and an additional 298 images in terms of
valence and arousal (Bradley, Greenwald, & Hamm, 1993). We
preselected the 298 images with the aim that they would not be
perceived as related to one of the four priming conditions
(EPþ, EPÀ, SPþ, and SPÀ). The 298 images depicted a multi-
plicity of topics, like animals, landscapes, and objects, but not
humans. Of the 298 images, we aimed to select 84 images that
closely matched the valence and arousal ratings of the 84 prim-
ing images in order to serve as control stimuli. However,
because we did not find enough images that closely matched
the 84 priming stimuli, we did a second rating with 20 males
who rated an additional 130 images. By this, we finally gath-
ered 84 images that matched the priming stimuli. These 84
matched images served as control stimuli (EPCþ, EPCÀ,
SPCþ, and SPCÀ). Similarly, 24 females rated the 84 images
of the four priming conditions (female set) and an additional
300 images (again, preselected, aiming not to relate to the four
priming conditions) to serve as control images in terms of
valence and arousal. Of the 300 images, we selected 84 images
that closely matched the 84 priming images with regard to the
female valence and arousal ratings. Two-sided paired t tests
revealed no significant differences between the valence and
arousal ratings of the experimental primes and corresponding
control primes. Mean valence and arousal ratings of the prim-
ing stimuli of the four experimental and the four control con-
ditions and p values are listed in Table 1.
Finally, we preselected 15 sexual-target images. These
images depicted heterosexual coitus. In order to prevent any
social or face processing, in these images neither faces, heads,
nor any meaningful background was visible. The visible back-
ground was mostly blank in light grey.
After the main experiment, all priming images (EPþ, EPÀ,
SPþ, SPÀ, EPCþ, EPCÀ, SPCþ, SPCÀ, and male and female
sets) were presented to nine additional raters (three males) in
order to validate whether the experimental priming stimuli
were perceived according to the intended priming conditions
and to exclude the possibility that the control priming stimuli
were perceived according to the experimental priming stimuli.
To this end, raters were asked to indicate whether a depicted
image displayed "economic abundance" (EPþ), "economic
shortage" (EPÀ), "friendly looking or caretaking adults"
(SPþ), "aggressive looking or behaving adults" (SPÀ),
"destruction," "mourning," "death," or "something else." The
experimental priming images were rated in almost all cases
according to the stimulus category (confirming ratings per cate-
gory: EPþ ¼ 99.6%, EPÀ ¼ 96%, SPþ ¼ 99.2%, and SPÀ ¼
96.1%). Similarly, control priming stimuli were rated in 92.4%

Participants
A total of 93 participants participated in the experiment. The
study was performed in three parts with three groups (Group I:
30 females; Group II: 34 females; and Group III: 29 males).
Groups were matched for age, Group I: M ¼ 23.5, SD ¼ 2.6
years; Group II: M ¼ 23.6, SD ¼ 4.3 years; Group III: M ¼ 25,
SD ¼ 4.2 years; one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) F(2,
92) ¼ 1.45, p ¼ .24, and education level (indicated on a 5-point
scale with 1 ¼ no degree and 5 ¼ high school; highest aca-
demic degree: Group I: 90% high school, 10% college; Group
II: 91% high school, 9% college; Group III: 76% high school,
24% college; Kruskal­Wallis test, p ¼ .17). Oral contracep-
tives were used by 18 participants of Group I and 19 partici-
pants of Group II.
Recruitment was accomplished through announcements on
the campus of the Kiel University (Germany) and in the com-
munity that asked for participation in a study on the psycho-
logical processing of sexual stimuli. The participants of our
mixed student-community sample received payment or course
credits for their participation. We prescreened the partici-
pants by means of an inventory to verify that they were not
mentally distressed (Lo
¨we, Spitzer, Zipfel, & Herzog, 2002).
By means of a self-constructed questionnaire, we verified that
the participants were heterosexual (i.e., Kinsey rating of fan-
tasy and behavior of 0 and 1; Kirk, Bailey, Dunne, & Martin,
2000) and had no history of sexual dysfunction or any other
sexual disorder.
Procedure
Participants were assessed individually or in small groups of up
to five individuals. Following a general introduction and com-
pletion of the questionnaires, participants were seated in front
of a computer monitor and keyboard.
One experimental trial consisted of 10 priming pictures (of
the same stimulus condition) and a sexual-target picture pre-
sented consecutively. Each priming picture was visible for 1.2 s
with no gaps in between. Five seconds after the target picture
onset, a visual analog scale appeared on the computer screen
(ranging from 0% to 100%) and prompted the subject to rate his
or her actual sexual arousal by means of a mouse click on the
visual analog scale. Three seconds after the mouse click, the
sexual-target picture disappeared and was followed by a fixa-
tion dot (3 s) indicating the beginning of the following trial.
Figure 1 shows the general design of the priming experiment.
In the first part, the females of Group I were exposed to the
priming conditions EPþ, EPÀ, SPþ, and SPÀ (female set). In
each trial, 10 primes of one condition were randomly selected
(of 21 primes), followed by one of the 15 sexual-target stimuli.
Each condition was repeated 15 times, each time with a differ-
ent target stimulus. Correspondingly, each target picture was
shown in every condition once. Priming conditions were
presented in random order. In total, one subject was exposed
to 15 Trials Per Condition Â 4 Conditions ¼ 60 trials, corre-
sponding to about ([12 s þ 5 s þ 3 s] Â 60 ¼) 20 min' stimulus
exposure time and the additional time the subject needed to rate
her actual sexual arousal after each target. In the second part,
the females of Group II were exposed to the priming conditions
EPCþ, EPCÀ, SPCþ, and SPCÀ (female set). The remaining
experimental conditions (number of trials, trial order, stimulus
exposure times, target stimuli, and rating of sexual arousal)
were identical to the first part. In the third part, the males of
Group III were exposed to the priming conditions EPþ, EPÀ,
SPþ, SPÀ, EPCþ, EPCÀ, SPCþ, and SPCÀ (male set). In
order to shorten the total duration time of the experiment in
the third part (given the double number of conditions in com-
parison to the first and second parts), we made some minor
changes to the third part. While the total number of trials per
condition, the number of priming stimuli within one trial, the
presentation time of each prime (1.2 s), and the intertrial inter-
val (3 s) remained unchanged, the visual analog scale appeared
immediately with the sexual-target stimulus and disappeared
immediately together with the sexual target after the subject
indicated his actual arousal with a mouse click. The male par-
ticipants in the third part were exposed to a total of 120 trials,
corresponding to about ([12 s þ 3 s] Â 120 ¼) 30 min' stimulus
exposure time and the additional time the subject needed to rate
his actual sexual arousal after each target. The eight priming
conditions of Part III were presented in random order. For each
participant, mean response values were calculated for each
priming condition to which he or she was subjected.
The effects of the experimental conditions on the dependent
variable (subjective sexual arousal) were calculated by means
of two mixed-model ANOVAs. The first mixed-model
ANOVA tested the effect of the EPs relative to the control
condition. It was built by entering the following factors: a
subject variable, gender (male vs. female) as a between-
group factor, prime type (EP vs. control primes [EPC]), prime
valence (positive primes [þ] vs. negative primes [À]), and a
covariable of no interest (total sexual arousal). The second
mixed-model ANOVA tested the effect of the SPs relative to
the control condition. It was built by entering the following
factors: a subject variable, gender (male vs. female) as a
between-group factor, prime type (SP vs. control primes
[SPC]), prime valence (positive primes [þ] vs. negative primes
[À]), and a covariable of no interest (total sexual arousal).
Results
Over all conditions, male and female participants were
moderately sexually aroused by the sexual targets. The three
groups did not differ significantly in their reported sexual
arousal, Group I: M ¼ 43.1, SD ¼ 16.8; Group II: M ¼ 40.7,
SD ¼ 15; Group III: M ¼ 42.7, SD ¼ 22.8; one-way ANOVA
F(2, 92) ¼ .16, p ¼ .85.
Mixed-model ANOVAs revealed a significant main effect
of prime valence in both the EP' analysis, F(1, 235) ¼ 28.3, p <
.001, and the SPs' analysis, F(1, 235) ¼ 70.4, p < .001,

and SPCþ) triggered increased sexual arousal relative to the
corresponding negative prime conditions (in both males and
females). Both mixed-model ANOVAs revealed a two-way
interaction between prime valence and prime type, EPs'
ANOVA: F(1, 235) ¼ 8.5, p < .01; SPs' ANOVA: F(1, 235)
¼ 7.4, p < .01, indicating that the experimental prime condi-
tions (EPþ, SPþ) were associated with an elevated sexual
response relative to the corresponding control conditions
(EPCþ, SPCþ). However, this effect appeared to be driven
by an increased response of the female participants, as indi-
cated by a three-way interaction: With regard to the EPs and the
corresponding control condition, the mixed-model ANOVA
revealed a significant 3-fold interaction among Gender Â

nomic priming condition (EPþ) relative to the negative eco-
nomic priming condition (EPÀ) and that this response
difference was not seen in the control conditions (EPCþ vs.

relative to SPÀ and that this effect did not happen in the control
conditions.
Discussion
We conducted a priming study aimed at drawing inferences
about the functional implementation of sex-dimorphic sexual
strategies in the human mind. To this end, we tested whether
priming stimuli that are nonsexual but relevant for sexual
strategies can alter responses to core sexual stimuli (i.e., the
functioning of the sexual module). To control for unspecific
emotional effects, we additionally used priming stimuli with-
out any relevance for sex-dimorphic sexual strategies but with
similar emotional characteristics in terms of valence and arou-
sal. As predicted, we found that the experimental primes
(EPþ and SPþ) enhanced sexual responses beyond an unspe-
cific effect in females but not in males. Additionally, we
found that an emotionally positively valued context (as rep-
resented by the EPCþ and SPCþ) promoted sexual
responses. We found that the effect of these nonspecific
primes was similar for males and females.
Consistent with the predictions of the parental investment
theory and with many findings about sex-dimorphic mating
preferences in humans, here we found that females' but not
males' sexual responses were particularly enhanced in a con-
text of high economic resources and social attachment. In real
life, contextual cues often coincide with sexual stimuli and it is
therefore difficult to draw clear conclusions about the way
these stimuli are processed. By disentangling contextual sti-
muli from sexual meaning and by using core sexual stimuli
that bear neither contextual information nor facial cues, some
inferences about sexual processing can be drawn. Since the EP
and SP lacked any sexual cues, it is not likely that the percep-
tion of these stimuli activated sexual stimulus processing (i.e.,
the sexual module). The EP and SP will rather have activated
other brain modules designed to process emotions like fear,
anger, social affection, or reward including functions of pattern
recognition and memory recall that are required to process
these stimuli. Most probably, the sexual module was activated
in our experiment the moment the sexual target appeared on the
screen (and the EP and SP had already disappeared). The
enhanced sexual response of females to the core sexual-target
stimuli (after being exposed to the SPþ and EPþ) cannot be
explained by the sexual module as it is currently described.
Following the current concept of the sexual module, the
response to the sexual-target stimuli would be expected to be
similar in the experimental conditions and the control condi-
tions and furthermore expected to be similar for males and
females. Our data rather support the two hypotheses we made
regarding the functioning of the sexual module: First, that the
processing of the sexual module can be modulated by the out-
put of other brain modules; and second, that this modulation
can be sex dimorphic. This interpretation is in accordance with
the view that brain modules may have inhibitory or enhancing
effects on some other modules, thereby allowing the mind to be
context sensitive (Barrett & Kurzban, 2006; Buss, 2008, p. 57;
Sperber, 2005). We suppose that the brain modules that were
activated by the EPþ and SPþ were functionally connected
with the sexual module in females more than in males and that
these connections provide processing resources that can be
used for enhanced sexual responding in case of a succeeding
sexual stimulus. The same holds for brain modules activated by
EPÀ and SPÀ which could be connected by inhibiting connec-
tions to the sexual module in females more than in males.

6 Evolutionary Psychology
With respect to the control primes, we interpret the enhancing
effect of the EPCþ and SPCþ stimuli within the context of affec-
tive priming and automatic sexual stimulus processing: Positively
valued primes preactivate memory codes of the sexual-target sti-
muli because they are affectively related (Janssen et al., 2000;
Klauer & Musch, 2003). Although the co-occurrence of positive
affect and subjective sexual arousal has been shown previously
(Peterson & Janssen, 2007), we are not aware of studies to date
that demonstrate the enhancing effect of positive affect on sexual
arousal,asitwasfoundinthepresentstudy.Itisofinterestthatthis
basic effect is similar for males and females, as it could reflect a
"unisex" aspect of the sexual module's functioning.
Our data suggest that the sexual module's processing is
more controlled by nonsexual brain modules in females than
in males, or, stated conversely, that sexual processing is less
context-dependent and more stimulus-driven in males than in
females. However, there might be contexts that would impact
the sexual responses of males and females differently from
what was found in the current study. For instance, in the case
of long-term mating, males might evaluate complex behavioral
aspects of their mates too. Similarly, differing impacts of con-
textual cues can be also expected in females, depending on
whether short-term mating or long-term mating is involved.
Effects of the menstrual cycle are also possible. Both genders
pursue mixed reproductive strategies and perform cost-benefit
analyses regarding whether short- or long-term mating will
maximize their reproductive success (Davies & Shackelford,
2008). In our study, we used sexual stimuli that lacked facial
cues, aiming to avoid identification of a potential mate in order
to keep things as simple as possible and to enhance the potency
of the preceding primes. Under these circumstances, without
any information regarding long- or short-term mating, females'
sexual responses were found to be more context dependent.
Roughly speaking, when everything else is equal, females'
sexual responses tend to be more context dependent (at least
with respect to the context we provided with our priming sti-
muli). This view is in accordance with a recent two-level model
of sexual processing that states low-level "straightforward
(automatic) matching between the stimulus and an adaptive
reaction" more in males, and high-level complex cognitive
stimulus processing that "involves extrapolation beyond sen-
sory input" more in females (Toates, 2017).
We only assessed subjective sexual arousal. Therefore, our
findings cannot be generalized to genital responses. Genital
responding of (heterosexual) females is puzzling, since it is
less correlated with subjective sexual arousal (Chivers, Seto,
Lalumiere, Laan, & Grimbos, 2010) and because it is less
gender specific as it is in males (Chivers, 2017). There is evi-
dence supporting our notion of an increased context depen-
dency in female genital responding. For instance, female
orgasm frequency was found to be positive related to the male
partner's family income (Gallup, Ampel, Wedberg, & Pogos-
jan, 2014). However, there is conflicting evidence as well. In
two studies, Chivers and Timmers (2012) and Timmers and
Chivers (2017) exposed their participants to auditory narratives
of sexual interactions that varied by relationship context
(stranger, friend, and long-term relationship). The genital
responses of both male and female participants were increased
in the stranger and in the long-term relationship context relative
to the friend context. In contrast to the present study, Chivers
and Timmers did not vary the context independently from the
sexual stimulus. It is therefore not possible to rule out the
possibility that the participants imagined in case of the friend
context less sexually attractive partners than in the other con-
texts (stranger, long-term relationship). Beside this limitation,
Chivers and Timmers findings limit the notion that males'
sexual responding is less context depended as females'. Com-
plex partner characteristics (e.g., the ability to provide
resources) might be evaluated by females more than by males
and therefore be able to modulate the sexual salience of a
potential mate in females more than in males. Such evaluations
reflect the sexual strategies of a person. Our findings indicate
that these evaluations are realized at the proximate level by a
network of varying connections between the sexual module and
other brain modules. A certain relationship context, such as the
one of "no relationship" (stranger) might be a context that
preactivates sexual meaning in males and in females because
it fits with the sexual strategies of both males and females
(because of the male typical strategy of indiscriminative sex
and females' pursuit for "good genes" in case of an attractive
stranger). The central aim of the present study was not to test
whether high-order contextual cues modulate sexual responses
in females more than in males in general but to provide a more
detailed model of how sex-dimorphic mating strategies could
be implemented in the human mind.
Recommendations for Future Research
The current paradigm could be used also to study clinical man-
ifestations of human sexuality. Prevalences of sexual dysfunc-
tions are highly sex dimorphic with sexual dysfunctions that are
related to a decreased sexual response being elevated in
females, like female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-
pelvic pain/penetration disorder, or female orgasmic disorder.
In contrast, sexual dysfunctions that are related to increased
sexual response, like premature orgasm or hypersexual disor-
der are elevated in males (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999).
This sex-dimorphic distribution of hyper- and hyposexual func-
tioning is in accordance with differences in selectivity of mates
as predicted by the parental investment theory (note: small
differences between the means of male and female sex drive
can lead to extended differences in outer parts of the distribu-
tions). That is, the elevated female selectivity might be realized
at the expense of an elevated number of females suffering from
sexual dysfunctions that are related to decrease sexual
response. In light of our findings, we would suppose that in
hyposexual females the functional connections between brain
modules that process EPþ and SPþ and the sexual module
would be less active than in sexually functioning females.
Thus, after a successful replication of these preliminary find-
ings, the current paradigm could be used to study particular
Ponseti et al. 7
manifestations of female sexuality and thereby enhance our
understanding of sexual dysfunctions.
To sum up. Our experimental paradigm appears to be sensitive
for sex-typical differences in sexual processing, with females'
sexual responses being more context dependent than males'
sexual responses. Our findings are in accordance with parental
investment theory that predicts females' mating behavior to be
more selective than males. Furthermore, this study adds to the
findings from numerous field studies in that females have
stronger preferences for mates who possess resources and are
willing to invest their resources in children. We replicated these
findings under restricted laboratory conditions that allowed us,
by disentangling nonsexual and sexual meaning, to study how
sexual strategies impact sexual responses. Our findings are
compatible with the concept of a core unisex sexual module.
The activity of this sexual module however is most likely
influenced by the output of other nonsexual modules in a
sex-dimorphic manner.
