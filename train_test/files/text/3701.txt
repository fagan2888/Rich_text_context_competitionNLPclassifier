The latter decades of the twentieth century witnessed two
dramatic transformations across Latin America: a univer-
sal, if uneven, adoption of economically liberalizing
reforms and a near complete replacement of the region's
autocracies with more democratic regimes. Not surpris-
ingly, the relationship between these two processes has
been intensely debated (see, e.g., Huber and Solt, 2004;
Walton 2004). Many have argued that economic liberaliza-
tion, by shifting decision-making power on a wide variety
of matters from state to market, has limited and undercut
democratic governance and so worked to demobilize civil
society (see, e.g., Kurtz, 2004). Others have contended that
the hardships imposed by liberalization have in fact rein-
vigorated democracy by spurring a variety of societal actors
to organize themselves and mobilize against neoliberal
reforms (see, e.g., Silva, 2009). Determining which of these
perspectives more accurately depicts the relationship
between economic liberalization and collective political
action in Latin American democracies is central to under-
standing if market liberalism has successfully redefined
citizenship rights as exclusively political or if instead col-
lective actors are broadening the concept of democratic
citizenship to include social and economic rights. It speaks,
in other words, to the question of which side of Polanyi's
(1944) `double movement' has gained the upper hand
across the region (see, e.g., Roberts, 2008).
Bellinger and Arce (2011), in their article entitled
`Protest and democracy in Latin America's market era',
provide the broadest empirical examination yet conducted
on this question, examining the impacts of economic liber-
alization on protest in seventeen Latin American countries
from 1970 to 2003. It argues for the second view outlined
above, the repoliticization thesis, maintaining that griev-
ances resulting from economic liberalization provide strong
framing opportunities for diverse social actors to overcome
their collective action problems and that, in the favorable

Abstract
Do neoliberal economic reforms in Latin American democracies mobilize citizens to overcome their collective action
problems and protest? A recent addition to the scholarship on this crucial question of the relationship of markets and
politics, Bellinger and Arce (2011), concludes that economic liberalization does have this effect, working to repoliticize
collective actors and reinvigorate democracy. We reexamine the article's analyses and demonstrate that they misinterpret
the marginal effect of the variables of theoretical interest. Thus, the article's optimistic claims about the consequences
for democracy of economic liberalization in the region are not supported by its own empirical results. It is argued here
that its results suggest instead that protests became more common in autocracies when they moved away from markets.
Rather than speaking to how people have mobilized to protest against liberal reforms in Latin America's democracies,
the work's analyses illuminate only when people protested against the region's dictatorships.

political opportunity provided by democracy, the result will
be more protest. After presenting a series of unconditional
fixed effects negative binomial regression models, the arti-
cle concludes that `collective political activity rises with
economic liberalization in democratic and semidemocratic
contexts' (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 699). Consequently, it
maintains that fears that market-oriented reforms have
eroded democracy across the region are unwarranted. On
the contrary, it contends, there is reason for optimism: eco-
nomically liberalizing reforms `are extending and deepen-
ing democracy' (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 700).
The article makes several important contributions to the
ongoing debate. Scholarship on the question had been pre-
viously dominated by case studies of positive examples of
mobilization, with the result that `although it is indisputa-
ble that much of the social protest in contemporary Latin
America is explicitly directed against neoliberal policies',
the relationship between reform and protest had `not been
subjected to rigorous empirical tests across cases and over
time' (Roberts, 2008: 338). Further, Bellinger and Arce
(2011) examines trends in protest in the region over more
than three decades, ensuring the inclusion of both the full
process of economic liberalization and that of democratiza-
tion. The article is also an exemplar of sensitivity analysis,
operationalizing both regime type and protest in a number
of different ways and demonstrating similar results across
all specifications. Finally, it usefully sharpens the concept
of economic liberalization to better match the theories sug-
gested by qualitative studies on the topic. In contrast to ear-
lier cross-national work, which investigated whether protest
was associated with the level of liberal economic policies,
Bellinger and Arce (2011, 692) examines how collective
actors `respond to changes in economic policy' because
arguments regarding the phenomenon focus `on the societal
effects of economic reforms, not the level of economic lib-
eralization generally'.
Despite these important contributions, our re-analysis
reveals that the claims by Bellinger and Arce (2011) are
based on an incorrect interpretation of its statistical results.
Specifically, the study runs into two pitfalls often encoun-
tered in the use of multiplicative interaction terms: it incor-
rectly interprets the coefficients separately and fails to
calculate correctly the marginal effect of the variable of
theoretical interest (see, e.g., Braumoeller, 2004; Brambor
et al., 2006). Remedying these issues demonstrates that
there is no support for the contention that economic liber-
alization produces higher rates of collective political pro-
tests in democratic or semidemocratic settings, dampening
hopes that unfettered markets and democracy are proving a
felicitous combination in Latin America.
Replication, results and
reinterpretation
According to the repoliticization theory, protest in Latin
America results from a confluence of motive and opportunity
(Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 691­692). Economic liberaliza-
tion, in this view, always generates grievances that motivate
people to collective action. These grievances are more likely
to actually cause protests to occur, however, when democracy
is present to provide a favorable political opportunity struc-
ture. The implication is that, at least in democracies, protests
should increase as liberalizing reforms increase. The article
claims that the evidence it presents supports this argument.
This claim is incorrect.
The faulty claim stems from the interpretation of multi-
plicative interaction terms. The analyses presented use
negative binomial regression ­ a method that logarithmi-
cally transforms the dependent variable to account for the
skewed distributions commonly found in count data ­ to
estimate the following equation:

In this equation, 3
and 5
, the coefficients for the two
multiplicative interaction terms, allow the effect of eco-
nomic liberalization on protest to vary with regime type:
democracy, semidemocracy, or autocracy.1 These multipli-
cative interaction terms are completely appropriate. That
protests should become more common as economic reforms
intensify and especially so in democratic (and, perhaps,
semidemocratic) settings is, of course, a conditional hypoth-
esis, and it is `well established that the intuition behind con-
ditional hypotheses is captured quite well by multiplicative
interaction models' (Brambor et al., 2006: 64).
It is equally well established that models containing
multiplicative interaction terms require particular care in
interpretation (see, e.g., Braumoeller, 2004; Brambor et al.,
2006). Here, the article's conclusions were justified on two
foundations: first, that `the interaction terms ­ Economic
Liberalization × Democracy and Economic Liberalization
× Semidemocracy --are positive and significant' and, sec-
ond, that the conditional `coefficients for Democracy and
Semidemocracy grow larger, more positive, and statisti-
cally significant when economic liberalization increases'
(Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 695). We reproduce the relevant
Bellinger and Arce (2011) results in Table 1.
Neither of these two foundations is up to the task. The
former is insufficient to support the conclusion: as Brambor
et al., (2006: 74) note, the `analyst cannot even infer whether
X has a meaningful conditional effect on Y from the magni-
tude and significance of the coefficient on the interaction
term'. We show below that the coefficient of the interaction
Solt et al. 3
term is only one component of the effect being examined
here. The latter is not directly relevant to the question at
hand. Given that the study is `primarily concerned with how
collective actors respond to economic liberalization in vary-
ing political contexts' (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 695), it is
the coefficient of Economic Liberalization for each regime
type that is much more to the point.
A reinterpretation of these results is therefore needed.2
The marginal effect of economic liberalization on the
logged number of protests (recall that negative binomial
regressions directly estimate the effects of independent
variables on the log of the dependent variable) is found by
taking the partial derivative of Equation 1 with respect to
economic liberalization:

That is, the estimated effect on logged protest of a
change in economic liberalization equals the sum of (1) the
estimated coefficient of economic liberalization, 1
, (2) the
product of the coefficient of the interaction between liber-
alization and democracy, 3
, and the indicator variable for
democracy, and (3) the product of the coefficient of the
interaction between liberalization and semidemocracy, 5
,
and the indicator variable for semidemocracy. This simpli-
fies to the sum 1
+ 3
for democratic regimes, to the sum 1
+5
for semidemocracies, and to just 1
for autocratic
regimes. This last point makes clear the only appropriate
interpretation of 3
and 5
: they represent not the effects of
Economic Liberalization in democracies and semidemocra-
cies, as asserted in Bellinger and Arce (2011, 695), but
rather only the difference in the effect of Economic
Liberalization from its effect in the reference category,
autocratic regimes.
Calculating the magnitude of the effect in each of the
three regime types is straightforward, but the standard error
(and statistical significance) of only the reference category,
autocratic regimes, can be determined from the information
provided in the article's tables. The formula for the stand-
ard error for democratic regimes is:

Similarly, the standard error for semidemocratic regimes
is calculated as:

Although the variances of 1
, 3
, and 5
are easily found
in the article's tables ­ they are the squares of the standard
errors for these coefficients ­ the covariances between the
coefficients are not available from the information provided
in a regression table: instead, the full variance-covariance
matrix is needed.
As a practical matter, the most straightforward approach
to finding these standard errors is a trivial re-specification
of the model: the choice of reference category for a categor-
ical variable is arbitrary, and the standard error of the coef-
ficient for the reference category chosen is directly available
in the regression results (see, e.g., Braumoeller, 2004: 815;
Brambor et al., 2006: 74). Here, replacing the dummy vari-
able for democracies in Equation 1 with a dummy variable
for autocratic regimes ­ that is, making democracy the ref-
erence category ­ makes no substantive change in the
model, but the reported coefficient and standard error of
Economic Liberalization in this re-specified model (corre-
sponding to 1
in the equations above) represent its effect in
democracies. The standard error and statistical significance
of the effect of Economic Liberalization in semidemocra-
cies can be found similarly, by including dummy variables
for autocracies and democracies and so making semidem-
ocracy the reference category.
Using a dot-and-whisker plot (see Kastellec and Leoni,
2007), Figure 1 depicts graphically the estimates and 95%
confidence intervals of the effect of economic liberalization
on the logged number of protests for each regime type when
countries are classified according to Freedom House data.3

4 Research and Politics 
We follow Bellinger and Arce (2011: 693) in emphasizing
the Freedom House results because `Freedom House argu-
ably provides the closest match to [the] conceptualization of
political opportunity' employed in that piece. As Bellinger
andArce (2011) demonstrate, and our replication confirmed,
a variety of other measures of regime type yield substan-
tively similar results; we therefore relegate these results to
the appendix. Figure 1 displays how the results of the nega-
tive binomial regressions indicate that economic liberaliza-
tion does not have a statistically significant effect on protest:
this is true whether we look at the total number of protests
(Model 1 of Bellinger and Arce (2011)), or strikes (Model
9), or riots (Model 12), or anti-government demonstra-
tions (Model 15). The results show that in autocracies the
liberalizing reform variable was statistically significantly
associated with fewer protests, with the exception of dem-
onstrations. In light of this finding, the fact that 3
and 5
are
estimated to be positive and statistically significant reveals
only that more liberalizing reform in democracies and semi-
democracies did not have the negative association with pro-
test that it did in autocracies, not that it served as a focal
point for the formation and mobilization of collective actors
as the repoliticization theory would have it.
We, of course, are more directly interested in the effect
of economic reforms on the number of protests, not on the
log of protests and, as noted above, the latter is the quantity
estimated by the negative binomial regression employed in
Bellinger and Arce (2011). Figure 2 presents the number of
protests in autocracies, semidemocracies, and democracies
predicted by the four models across the observed range of
economic liberalization when all other variables are fixed
at their mean values. In each case, the solid lines indicate
the predicted number of protests and the shaded regions
correspond to the 95% confidence intervals of these predic-
tions. For autocracies, the numbers of total protests, strikes
and riots (but not demonstrations) are predicted to be statis-
tically significantly lower as liberalizing reform increases.
For semidemocracies and democracies, the wide
confidence intervals in every panel can easily encompass a
horizontal line representing no change at all in protest
activity over the range of economic liberalization. In fact,
under these conditions, in semidemocracies the point pre-
dictions of all four measures of protest decline with rising
liberalization, and in democracies riots are also predicted to
fall as economic liberalization rises. None of this supports
the interpretation that `collective political activity rises
with economic liberalization in democratic and semidemo-
cratic contexts' offered in Bellinger and Arce (2011: 699).
An extension: Protest and liberal
economic reform
The results of Bellinger and Arce (2011) do not support the
interpretation offered in that article. Liberalizing economic
reforms in democracies do not in fact predict that more pro-
tests occur. The conclusion that they do, as we have shown
above, was based on common misinterpretations of multi-
plicative interaction terms. The confusion regarding the
application of multiplicative interaction terms is com-
pounded by the article's measure of liberalizing reform.
Asecond look at Figure 2 reveals that liberalizing reform
only has statistically significant effects on protest in auto-
cratic settings and that these effects occur largely, if not
entirely, across only the negative values of the variable. As
discussed above, however, the Bellinger and Arce (2011)
measure of liberalizing reform represents change in the
level of economic liberalization. Positive values represent
reforms that increase the role of free markets and reduce the
role of the state in the economy. Negative values, in turn,
represent moves away from free markets; that is, statist
reforms. Including both liberal reforms and statist reforms
in the same measure in this way constrains them to have
equal and opposite effects on protest. Given that changes in
either direction may generate losers with incentives to
mobilize, to assume that reforms in one direction increase
protests and reforms in the other reduce them would seem
unwise. Further, nothing in the repoliticization theory sug-
gests that the effect of liberal reforms is the opposite of
statist reforms.
Removing this constraint is easily accomplished by
splitting the measure into two variables. The first measures
the magnitude of liberal reforms and takes on a value of
zero when statist reforms are adopted; the second measures
the magnitude of statist reforms and takes on a value of
zero when liberal reforms are adopted. Table 2 presents the
relevant results when these two variables are substituted for
the original liberalizing reforms measure in the Bellinger
and Arce (2011) models.
The coefficients for the interaction term between liberal
reform and democracy indicate that there is no statistically
significant difference between autocracies and democracies
in the coefficient of liberal reform for total protests, strikes,
or antigovernment demonstrations. There is a statistically

significant difference in the coefficient for riots, but as we
noted earlier, because the effect in democracies of liberal
reform on the logged number of riots is equal to the sum of
this coefficient and the coefficient for liberal reform, this is
insufficient to support the conclusion that riots increase
with liberal reform in democracies. Figure 3 displays the
coefficients and standard errors of liberal and statist eco-
nomic reforms in all three regime types.
It reveals that the estimated coefficient for liberal reforms
in democracies on riots is in fact negative and not distin-
guishable from zero. The only statistically significant coef-
ficient for liberal reforms in democracies is on
demonstrations. Any support this finding might provide for
the repoliticization theory is more apparent than real, how-
ever. This coefficient is not statistically significantly differ-
ent from those for semidemocracies and autocracies,

providing no evidence that the more favorable political
opportunity structure in democracies yields a more vigorous
protest response. Moreover, the predicted difference in the
actual quantity of interest, the number of demonstrations,
between a country with no liberal reform and one with the
largest observed liberal reform is small and not statistically
significant: 0.9 ± 1.0 demonstrations, as can be seen in
Figure 4. Like those for the other measures of protest, the
confidence interval for the predicted number of demonstra-
tions in democracies can accommodate a horizontal line
representing no change at all over the full observed range of
liberal reform.
If, as we have demonstrated, the results of Bellinger and
Arce (2011) and our extension to it do not support the repo-
liticization theory, what do they show? A re-examination of
Figure 2 reveals that liberalizing reform, measured as a sin-
gle variable, only has statistically significant effects on pro-
test in autocratic settings and that these effects occur
largely, if not entirely, across only the negative values of
the variable. This point is confirmed in Figure 3: when lib-
eral and statist reforms are measured separately, the posi-
tive and statistically significant coefficients for statist
reforms in autocracies stand out as the only consistent
results. Figure 5 confirms these effects on the actual quanti-
ties of interest, the number of protests, over the observed
range of statist reform.
Rather than speaking to how people have mobilized to
protest against liberal reforms in Latin America's democra-
cies, then, these results illuminate when people protested
against the region's dictatorships. Latin American autocra-
cies frequently pursued a two-pronged strategy of depoliti-
cization, pairing free market reforms of the economy with
harsh repression of civil society. It was when these regimes
backed away from free market policies ­ a signal that divi-
sions had arisen in the authoritarian coalition of the mili-
tary, domestic business, and foreign capital ­ that
emboldened citizens went to the streets to protest.
Chile under Pinochet is the paradigmatic example on
both counts. When its program of nearly complete financial
deregulation led to financial crisis in 1982, the military
government abruptly reversed course and intervened exten-
sively in the Chilean economy. Dubbed by critics the
`Chicago Road to Socialism' in mocking reference to the
Via Chilena that the Pinochet government had worked to
eradicate, the statist reforms in Chile in 1983 are second in
size in the Bellinger and Arce (2011) data only to those that
marked the return of Peronism to Argentina in 1973.
Massive demonstrations followed this sign of the

Conclusion
Despite the important contributions made by Bellinger
and Arce (2011) to the debate on the relationships of eco-
nomic liberalization, democracy and protest, there is no
support for the article's conclusions in its empirical
results. The repoliticization theory suggests that liberal-
izing reforms should, in democratic settings, provoke pro-
tests. In a critical re-analysis of the empirical evidence
offered, we reveal that they do not. There is no support for
the conclusion that liberalizing reforms produce political
protests in Latin America's democratic or semidemocratic
regimes. Instead, this evidence indicates only that protests
were only triggered by statist reforms in Latin American
autocracies.
That economic liberalization may not consistently pro-
voke protest in democracies should not come as a surprise.
Roberts' (2008: 337) survey of the case-oriented scholar-
ship on resistance and acquiescence to neoliberal reforms
in Latin America concludes, `Liberalization does not create
homogeneous interests, hardships, or insecurities among
subaltern groups, and neither does it generate a uniform
response'. Future work on the issue should focus on eluci-
dating the conditions in which liberalizing reform by demo-
cratic governments generates collective protest.
One particularly important facet of this research will be
the collection of higher quality data on protest across the
region. The analyses replicated above, like previous cross-
national research, rely on data drawn from Banks (2008)
for protest counts (see Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 692). As
Herkenrath and Knoll (2011: 164) document, for Latin
American countries these data are based solely on protest
coverage in the New York Times. One might argue with
some justification that events covered by the NYT `are pre-
cisely the type of events that affect national political

Notes: Solid lines indicate predicted values, and shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals. Regimes are classified using Freedom House data;
see text for details. Results of Bellinger and Arce (2011) Model 1 (Total Protests), Model 9 (Strikes), Model 12 (Riots), and Model 15 (Demonstra-
tions), but substituting separate variables for statist and liberal reforms in place of the single measure of economic reform employed in that study.
All other variables are fixed at mean values.

outcomes' (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 692). However, a
meticulous comparison of protest coverage in the NYT and
local media sources, though limited to just three Latin
American countries in one year, found that `there are sig-
nificant country differences in the magnitude of the respec-
tive distortions' in coverage even when a host of protest
characteristics are taken into account (Herkenrath and
Knoll, 2011: 164). These distortions in the Banks data, of
course, make it more difficult to discern whatever effects
liberalizing reforms may have on protest.
The issue of the relationship between liberalizing
reforms and collective protest across Latin America's
democracies is crucially important. By bringing more and
better quantitative data to the examination of the problem
than previous work, Bellinger andArce (2011) made impor-
tant contributions to the debate. As we have shown, how-
ever, the article's results are far from conclusive. Whether
markets are undermining or reinvigorating democracy in
the region remains an open question.

Notes
1. X in this equation refers to the matrix of included control vari-
ables, namely lagged GDP growth, lagged logged GDP per
capita, lagged logged inflation, lagged imports plus exports
as a percentage of GDP, lagged net inflows of foreign invest-
ment as a percentage of GDP, logged population, the level of
economic liberalization, the regional mean of the dependent
variable, and country dummies to capture fixed effects; the lag
of the dependent variable was also included to control for any
temporal dependence (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 693­694).
2. The replication process was straightforward. Bellinger and
Arce kindly and promptly supplied their data and command
files at our request, and we were able to quickly and easily
reproduce the results that they reported. This remains note-
worthy given the unfortunate difficulty that these tasks fre-
quently pose (see, e.g., Gelman, 2011; Janz, 2013).
3. By this classification, countries were considered democra-
cies if determined by Freedom House to be `free'that is, they
had an average score of 2.5 or lower on the seven-point indi-
ces of civil liberties and of political rights. Countries were
considered semidemocracies if they had an average rating of
3 to 5 and so were labeled as `partly free'. All others were
classified as autocracies (Bellinger and Arce, 2011: 692).

Figure 6. Re-analyses of models included in `Table 1. Economic liberalization and protest using categorical measures of democracy'
(Bellinger and Arce 2011, 694).
Notes: The points indicate coefficient estimates from negative binomial regressions, and the whiskers trace 95% confidence intervals. Replicated
results of Bellinger and Arce (2011) Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, and Model 4. Model 4 uses a dichotomous measure of democracy and so no
coefficient for semidemocracy is estimated. Coefficients for control variables are not depicted. All of the confidence intervals for semidemocracy
and democracy (as indicated by the vertical whiskers) cross zero on the y-axis, indicating that the results are not statistically significant.

Notes: Solid lines indicate coefficient estimates from negative binomial regressions, and dotted lines trace the bounds of the 95% confidence inter-
vals. Replicated results of Bellinger and Arce (2011) Model 5, Model 6, Model 7, and Model 8. Coefficients for control variables are not depicted.
The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval never crosses zero on the y-axis of any of these graphs, indicating that the positive coefficients for
economic liberalization estimated at higher, more democratic levels of these indices fail to reach statistical significance.
