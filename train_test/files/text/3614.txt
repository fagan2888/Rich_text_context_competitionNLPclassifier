Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common
forms of secondary hypertension. The reported preva-
lence of PA varies widely, ranging from 1.4­32%, due to
varying study design and screening criteria. However,
autonomous aldosterone secretion may be present in more
than 30% of hypertensive patients, according to recent
findings.1 The recently investigated prevalence of PA in
the Chinese population is 7.1% within refractory hyper-
tension, and within this the proportion of hypokalemia is
up to 52.54%.2
PA comprises a wide spectrum of conditions ranging
from a solitary unilateral nodule producing aldosterone to
bilateral diffuse or nodular hyperplasia, with several inter-
mediate phenotypes. Two major causes of PA are recog-
nized: idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA), accounting
for 60­70% of patients with PA, and aldosterone-producing
adenoma (APA), accounting for 30­35%.3
The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) mediates several
classical physiological processes, including body water
and electrolyte homeostasis, blood pressure (BP) regula-
tion and aldosterone generation, based on the angiotensin
II type 1and type 2 receptors (AGTR1, AGTR2) subtype
system. Genetic or environmental factors may affect the

Abstract
Hypothesis: Polymorphisms in angiotensin II type-1/2 receptor genes (AGTR1/AGTR2) may be involved in the
pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism. The present study aims to reveal some loci susceptible to the disease on the
genes in a group of Chinese Han nationality.
Materials and methods: A case-control study was conducted in 202 patients and 188 controls. Ten tagging SNPs
on AGTR1/AGTR2 were genotyped for all subjects via the method of multiplex PCR-ligase detection reaction. Statistical
analysis was performed with chi-square test and logistic regression analysis.
Results: rs3772616 on the AGTR1 gene was a factor for susceptibility to primary aldosteronism (p<0.001), and the
TT genotype significantly decreased the risk of primary aldosteronism compared with the CC homozygote (p=0.008,
adjusted OR=0.13; 95%CI: 0.03­0.59). The rs3772616 polymorphism was associated with primary aldosteronism under
the additive and dominant models. The female carriers of the G allele in rs5193 showed a significant difference compared
with the T allele.
Conclusions: The AGTR1 rs3772616 polymorphism can be considered as a hereditary marker for primary aldosteronism,
and in the Chinese Han population the rs5193 G allele seems to predispose to it only in women.

expression and activity of AGTR1 and AGTR2, which
may impair their regulatory functions and eventually lead
to the development of related diseases.
The AGTR1 gene is located on chromosome 3q21-25
with a length of about 45 kb, containing five exons and four
introns. Its expression product ­ AGTR1 ­ plays an integral
role in BP, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyper-
tension. The association between AGTR1 gene polymor-
phisms and essential hypertension has been widely studied,
but the results remain controversial.4 Otherwise, AGTR1
expression was reported repeatedly to be correlated with the
functional status of adrenocortical tumors, including APA.5
The gene encoding AGTR2 is located on chromosome
Xq22-q23, which contains a limited number of 15 known
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. For its part,
AGTR2 mainly plays a role in cardiovascular function and
programmed cell death. It has also been demonstrated that
expression of AGTR2 in APA tissue was lower than that in
normal adrenal gland tissues. Our previous research showed
that the rs5194 SNP in the AGTR2 gene was significantly
associated with the risk of APA.6 On the basis of our previ-
ous study and other relevant literature, we decided to fur-
ther investigate the associations of multi-polymorphisms in
two AGTR genes with the risk of PA.
Materials and methods
Subjects
Through screening thousands of suspicious patients from
the Han population from Fujian Province of China with the
aldosterone plasma renin activity ratio, our study enrolled
202 sporadic patients who were hospitalized and diag-
nosed with PA after endocrinal confirmatory tests, mostly
the saline infusion test and Captopril Challenge test.
Computed tomography scanning of the adrenal glands and
adrenal vein sampling were undertaken for subtype diag-
nosis according to the latest guideline for PA. Another 188
healthy Chinese volunteers without hypertension or any
adrenal disease were recruited as the control group from
the health examination center of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Xiamen University. The study was approved
by the Institutional Ethical Committee (EC-ZD-002·02) of
the hospital, and written informed consent forms were
obtained from each participant before any examination or
data collection.
Selection of SNPs loci
Based on public SNP databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/SNP/ and http://www.hapmap.org/) of CHB popula-
tions and published literature, data for SNPs in theAGTR1/
AGTR2 genes were selected for our study. We then applied
Haploview software version 4.2 to choose the tagSNPs,
which enabled us to capture all common SNPs within the
entire AGTR1/AGTR2 gene sequences according to r2
linkage disequilibrium (LD) (threshold 0.8) and a minor
allele frequency (MAF) 0.05. The 10 tagSNPs were
rs12695877, rs2638360, rs1492100, rs37726216 and
rs2675511 in intron 2, rs385338, rs275649, rs6801836 in
intron 3 of the AGTR1 gene and rs5193 in 3'-UTR exon 3,
rs1403543 in intron 1of the AGTR2 gene.
DNA extraction
Venous blood of each individual was sampled into sterile
anticoagulation tubes and cryopreserved. Genomic DNA
was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the
TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing,
China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Genotyping
The SNPgenotyping work was performed using an improved
multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique
developed by Genesky Biotechnologies Inc. (Shanghai,
China). A multiplex PCR-ligase detection reaction method
was used in the iMLDR. For each SNP, the alleles were dis-
tinguished by different fluorescent labels of allele-specific
oligonucleotide probe pairs. Different SNPs were further dis-
tinguished by different extended lengths at the 3'end. A ran-
dom sample accounting for ~5% (n=20) of the total DNA
samples was directly sequenced using Big Dye-terminator
version 3.1 and an ABI3730XL automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) to confirm the results of iMLDR.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical data between groups were com-
pared using the 2test or Student's t-test. Quantitative vari-
ables were expressed as the mean ±SD. Multiple
comparisons were made using one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA), and Bonferroni correction was applied to
avoid false positives.
The allele and genotype frequencies of both groups were
comparedusing2 statisticsorFisher'sexacttest.Compliance
with Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium in each group was subse-
quently assessed using the Haploview. An expectation maxi-
mization algorithm was used for all haplotype analysis on the
SHEsis, a web-based program which also helped to manage
the calculation of LD and genetic association.7,8 Odds ratios
(ORs) and their adjustment for relevant variables (gender,
age, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol consump-
tion) were calculated as estimates of risk relative to disease,
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained by logistic
regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS version 13.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA). A p-value less
than 0.05 or OR equal to 1.00 not in the range of 95% CI
indicated statistical significance.

Results
Basic characteristics of the study population
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups
are listed in Table 1. There was no significant difference in
gender, age and BMI; controls were matched for age and
gender. Significant differences in PA-related parameters
and some blood lipid levels were observed between
groups.
Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
There was no deviation of genotype frequencies from the
Hardy­Weinberg expectation in all SNPs, which indicated
that the subjects were representative in the field (all
p>0.05, data not shown).
Analysis of AGTR1/AGTR2 gene polymorphisms
The C allele of rs3772616 in AGTR1 was more prevalent in
the patients with PA compared with control subjects
(p<0.001). Other allelic distributions of SNPs between
groups were statistically insignificant (Table 2). Table 3
shows the genotypic distributions and their association anal-
yses under the assumed co-dominant model. The TT geno-
type of rs3772616 showed a significant difference (p=0.008,
adjusted OR=0.13; 95%CI: 0.03­0.59) compared with the
CC homozygote, whether considering the confounding fac-
tors or not. A small difference was observed in the GA geno-
type of rs1403543 in AGTR2 between groups, which without
including the influence of other covariates would be a false
positive (p=0.04). Meanwhile, in rs5193, a significant
difference was seemingly revealed in GT versus GG after
adjustment for the mixed effects of gender, age, BMI, smok-
ing and alcohol consumption (p=0.03, adjusted OR=0.45;
95%CI: 0.22­0.93).
Furthermore, four common genetic models were
assumed in order to verify their possible hereditary

characteristics (Table 4). The rs3772616 polymorphism in
the AGTR1 gene was significantly associated with PA in
additive (OR=0.52, 95%CI: 0.35­0.78, p=0.001) and
dominant (OR=0.54, 95%CI: 0.35­0.86, p=0.008) pat-
terns. Regarding the rs5193 polymorphism under a hete-
rozygous advantage model, individuals with the GT
genotype had a 0.37-fold decreased risk of developing PA
after adjusting for the known risk factors (p=0.009;
95%CI: 0.179­0.79). Given that rs5193 is located on the
X chromosome, to which sex-linked inheritance belongs,
stratification analysis based on different gender was sub-
sequently adopted. As a result (Table 5), the T allele
showed a significant difference compared with the G
allele in female subjects, meaning that the G allele in
rs5193 may reflect a genetic predisposition to PA in
women (p=0.016).

Haplotype analysis
As the selected eight tagSNPs in the AGTR1 gene are suf-
ficient to construct most of the haplotype structures in this
genomic region, we explored further to identify the most
significant one to explain the hereditary susceptibility of
PA. Seven haplotypes of the AGTR1 gene with frequen-
cies above 3% either in cases or controls are shown in
Table 6. Hap4 TATCACGC had a lower incidence in the
cases group (0.009) than in the controls group (0.032), but
the p-value did not reach the significant level after
Bonferroni correction (p=0.027 > 0.05/7). No significant
difference in frequencies of AGTR2 haplotypes was
observed between two groups (data not shown).
Discussion
As a pathogenetically heterogeneous disease, the etiology
of PA is still elusive and vague. Based on several basic
investigations the intra-adrenal RAS, which is a major
regulator of aldosterone generation, was extensively
focused on in investigating the mechanism of excessive
aldosterone secretion.9,10 To date, the pathophysiological
role of the RAS in PA has been elucidated and compo-
nents of the RAS such as AGTR1, AGTR2, CYP11B1,
CYP11B2 and mineralocorticoid receptor have been
reported to be widely involved in the regulation of auton-
omous aldosterone. It is known that the activation of
AGTR1 can trigger the synthesis and secretion of aldos-
terone. The increased expression of AGTR1 mRNA in
APA has long been confirmed.11 Previous research has
suggested that AGTR2 may partially contribute to the
overproduction of aldosterone in angiotensin II (AT II)-
responsive APA,12 which may derive from its antagonistic
effect towards the AGTR1-mediated function of AT II
including cell growth, vasoconstriction and cardiovascu-
lar fibrosis. Otherwise, a pathological continuum between
APA and IHA featuring a transition from hyperplasia to a
nodular phase has been proposed, suggesting that patho-
genic mechanisms common to these conditions exist.13
Our earlier study preliminarily demonstrated that down-
regulation of AGTR2, leading to a deficiency in counter-
balancing the effects of angiotensin II mediated by
AGTR1, could finally promote adrenal zona glomerulosa
cell proliferation and aldosterone hypersecretion.14
According to a series of investigations concerning the
connections between AGTR1/2 and the pathology of the
adrenal cortex, we speculate that the overexpression of
AGTR1 and reduced expression of AGTR2 may be asso-
ciated with the pathophysiological processes of PA and

the relative gene risk variants inevitably involved in this
disease, by altering the activity of genes and affecting
their transcription and post-transcription. Although such
an assumption needs more studies for clarification,
AGTR1 and AGTR2 could be presumed to be factors in
association with the susceptibility of PA.
The aim of the present pilot study was to explore
whether genetic variants of AGTR constitute associated
factors for the hereditary susceptibility of PAin the Chinese
population. To date, very few epidemiological studies have
been published related to the predisposition to PA, mostly
focused on APA, and these have analyzed few SNPs. In
this sense, our study is novel and takes us one step further
in finding the genetic risk of developing this disease.
Based on the LD patterns and empirical genome-wide
data from the international HapMap project, we obtained a
set of informative SNPs (tagSNPs) which are representa-
tive of the remaining SNPs, so that the genotyping burden
can be reduced without much loss of power for disease
association studies.15,16 In this context, eight tagSNPs
within the intron of AGTR1 were selected to cover all the
genetic information of this region. Another two tagSNPs
located in intron 1 (rs1403543) and 3'UTR exon3 (rs5193)
identically shared information in their vicinity. However,
such a method inevitably misses some rare SNPs associ-
ated with this disease since MAF0.05 was used to select
the tagging SNPs based on the limited sample size.
In relation to our results, the rs3772616 polymorphism
has been investigated elsewhere to study the relationship
between genetic variants in RAS and assumed salt-related
BP. This study reported that rs3772616 was associated
with diastolic BP(DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).
In particular, the number of T alleles was associated with
an increased mean DBP response to low-sodium interven-
tion.17 Considering that the mineralocorticoid aldosterone
can regulate the level of sodium in the body and may inter-
act with sodium loading to induce hypertension as well as
cardiac injury,18 PA and sodium intake probably share
some genetic pathways or markers in multiple environ-
mental­genetic interactions, which may play an important
role in salt-sensitive hypertension and aldosterone modu-
lation.19 Our findings that carriers of the C allele in
rs3772616 were found more frequently among patients
with PA raised an issue that the major allele corresponded
to the risk allele. Such a phenomenon is not rare in genome-
wide association studies, especially in complex disease.
Carriers of the major allele have a higher risk of develop-
ing some less prevalent disease, indicating that the muta-
tion makes the locus protective in terms of its own
susceptibility. However, it is more likely that this locus
represents only a small increment in risk together with
some main causative variants near or far from this region
which have the main genetic effect on the association. The
underlying rationale of this inconsistency derives from the
complexity of the genetic architecture, and must be
explained in terms of heredity, variation and evolution. In
addition, Gu et al.20 found that a potential interaction of
CYP11B2-AGTR1 is involved in the etiology of hyperten-
sion. Against the background that the pathogenesis of
essential hypertension is undefined, the question of
whether secondary hypertension caused by PA follows a
similar gene­gene interactive model is worthy of further
research. If this is the case, AGTR1 interacting with other
genes may constitute a disease locus of secondary hyper-
tension caused by hyperaldosteronism.
With regard to rs5193, the GT genotype seemed to pro-
tect against PA, with a p-value of 0.009 (adjusted OR=0.37;
95%CI: 0.18­0.79) under the heterozygote advantage or
overdominance model. However, such a tiny difference in
statistics and the insignificant difference in the distribution
of corresponding alleles drove us to analyze in more depth,
since only a small proportion of loci had polymorphisms
maintained by heterozygote advantage.21 After stratifica-
tion by sex, we found that a significant difference only
occurred in the female subgroup (p=0.016), and not in
males (p=0.169). Knowing that females originally showed
a higher prevalence of PA than males, this result could be
interpreted that polymorphisms of rs5193 may rooted in
this sex-linked disease. Otherwise, Min Zhang et al.22
reported that the T allele of rs5193 linking with the A allele
of rs5194 had cardioprotective effects on essential hyper-
tension.As we know, an excess of autonomous aldosterone
secretion causes great cardiovascular damage independent
of secondary hypertension. Interestingly, our finding that

the T allele of rs5193 protected against PA was consistent
with its cardioprotective role to some degree. Thus, we
wonder whether the rs5193 gene polymorphism is associ-
ated with cardiovascular events caused by hypertension
secondary to PA, although more targeted research is
required to prove this in the future.
In our study, no haplotype was found to be significantly
different between cases and controls. The one with most
potential ­ Hap4 TATCACGC ­ failed to show signifi-
cance after Bonferroni correction. However, there is con-
siderable controversy about adjusting the p-value after
multiple tests in clinically orientated studies.23 With this in
mind, whether a truly important difference was hidden by
the increased likelihood of type II errors remains unknown.
In addition, our effort to explore any gene marker to distin-
guish IHA and APA found no significant difference, which
may be mainly due to the small sample size ofAPApatients
(n=57), despite their intrinsic similarity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
exploreAGTR-associatedlociinPApathogenesis.Therefore,
some limitations of the study must be taken into account for
correct interpretation of our data. First, as a retrospective
case-control study, the number of patients is relatively small
because of the very low prevalence of PA, and the statistical
power is accordingly reduced. Larger case-control studies,
as well as independent cohorts of patients, are suggested to
validate our findings. Second, more data in Chinese, espe-
cially in other ethnic groups, are necessary in future studies
in order to make results more representative, since all our
subjects are confined to the Han people of Fujian Province,
southeast of China. Third, the confounding factors between
groups are not limited to those mentioned above. It is diffi-
cult to adjust for other environmental factors, such as diet,
physical activity and metabolic level. Last but not the least,
it should be emphasized that the genetic pathways underly-
ing this complex disease remain largely elusive due to
unpredictable factors such as polygenic inheritance, genetic
heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, gene­environment
interaction and others.24 Thus, the variations of AGTR may
be related just to risk factors, inducing factors or impact fac-
tors, rather than directly to the disease itself.
Conclusions
The current study suggests that the rs3772616 polymorphism
in AGTR1 may play a role in susceptibility to PA in the Han
Chinese population, with the C allele predisposing to it.
Meanwhile, females carrying the G allele on rs5193 of
AGTR2 may be also susceptible to PA. Due to the complexity
of definite diagnosis of PAand our limited number of patients,
the present results require confirmation in larger studies.
