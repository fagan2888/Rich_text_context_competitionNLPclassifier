Abstract
Objectives
Little is known about patterns and correlates of Complementary Health Approaches (CHAs)
in chronic pain populations, particularly in rural, underserved communities. This article
details the development and implementation of a new survey instrument designed to
address this gap, the Complementary Health Approaches for Pain Survey (CHAPS).
Design
Following pilot-testing using pre-specified criteria to assess quality and comprehension in
our target population, and after feedback regarding face-validity from content experts and
stakeholders, the final cross-sectional self-report survey required 10­12 minutes to com-
plete. It contained 69 demographic, lifestyle and health-related factors, and utilized a Trans-
theoretical Model (TTM) underpinning to assess short- and long-term use of 12 CHAs for
pain management. Twenty additional items on pain severity, feelings, clinical outcomes,
and activities were assessed using the Short-Form Global Pain Scale (SF-GPS); Internal
reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.
Settings/location
Investigators conducted consecutive sampling in four West Virginia pain management and
rheumatology practices.

Results
Response rates were high (88% ± 4.1%). High quality and comprehension deemed the
CHAPS an appropriate measurement tool in a rural population with pain. Missing data were
unrelated to patient characteristics. Participants predominantly experienced chronic pain
(93%), had five or more health conditions (56%, Mean = 5.4±3.1), were white (92%), female
(57%), and middle-aged (Mean = 55.6 (SD = 13.6) years). Over 40% were disabled (43%)
and/or obese (44%, Mean BMI = 33.4±31.5). Additionally, 44% used opioids, 31% used
other prescription medications, and 66% used at least one CHA for pain, with 48% using
CHAs for greater than 6 months. There was high internal reliability of the SF-GPS (alpha =
.93) and satisfactory internal reliability for each of the five TTM stages across (all) twelve
CHAs: precontemplation (0.89), contemplation (0.72), preparation (0.75), action (0.70), and
maintenance (0.70).
Conclusions
The CHAPS is the first comprehensive measurement tool to assess CHA use specifically for
pain management. Ease of administration in a population with pain support further use in
population- and clinic-based studies in similar populations.
Introduction
Chronic pain, defined as pain persisting beyond normal tissue healing time of 3­6 months[1],
affects over 25 million adults in the U.S. each year[2]. Unrelieved pain results in decreased phys-
ical function, longer hospital stays, and increased rates of re-hospitalization and outpatient vis-
its[3], leading to lost employment, income, and insurance coverage. Although measurement
tools exist to enable physician-patient communication regarding specific components of pain
(e.g., frequency and severity)[4, 5], there is a need to assess the reliability of existing, brief mea-
surement tools such as the Short-Form Global Pain Scale (SF-GPS), which incorporate quality
of life factors often impacted by the presence of chronic pain[6].
People with some pain conditions have increased risk for comorbid pain disorders [7], which
may add complexity to pain management plans. Current treatment methods for pain are largely
inadequate, and non-opioid medications such as Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
(NSAIDs) carry side effects for as many as 25% of long-term users[8]. In addition to the potential
harm induced by NSAIDs and other non-opioids, a worrisome trend of increased prescription
and utilization of opioid treatment for chronic nonmalignant pain has emerged over the past
decade[9], despite accompanying physical and psychological dependence. Further, age-adjusted
deaths involving opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999[10]. In particular, West Virgin-
ia's overdose death rate has been climbing (2010 and 2014: 28.9 and 35.5 per 100,000, respec-
tively), and was more than double the national rate, which has also been rising over time (2010
and 2014: 12.4 and 16.1 per 100,000)[11, 12]. A 2010 Pain Report from The Institute of Medicine
stresses the importance of increased research regarding the translation of effective treatments for
chronic pain into practice[3], and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends

non-opioid pharmacologic therapy be combined with non-pharmacologic therapy to reduce
pain and improve function to provide greater benefit[13]. Thus, the potential of non-pharmaco-
logical therapies for chronic pain management has garnered recent research interest[14­16].
Pain-related disorders are the most commonly reported conditions for which patients use
Complementary Health Approaches (CHAs)[17­19]; these include natural products (e.g., vita-
mins, herbs, probiotics, etc.) and Mind-body practices (e.g., yoga, meditation, etc.), as well as
Naturopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and others. Although their use is considered some-
what controversial, at least 30% of the U.S. population uses CHAs[20]. Further, most people use
CHAs with conventional treatments[21­23]. The most comprehensive economic review to date
(N = 28 trials) concluded that substituting a CHA in place of usual care had better health out-
comes and lower costs than usual care alone for a variety of chronic health conditions[24]. How-
ever, studies regarding patterns and correlates of CHA use in chronic pain populations remain
relatively few, as does research regarding the overlap of CHA use and/or conventional treatments
among those with pain conditions[25]. Further, little is known regarding the relation of specific
demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors to CHAs used specifically for pain; epidemio-
logic research is particularly sparse in Appalachian and other underserved communities. Many
of these communities have the highest rates of pain conditions in the nation, including arthritis
[26], yet have a rich anecdotal history of using natural products for pain management[27­30].
Numerous measurement tools have been developed to collect information regarding popula-
tion-level CHA use in the U.S.[31­44]. However, only two have assessed CHAs used specifically
for pain; of these resource-intensive telephone-based surveys, one lacked the identification of dif-
ferent CHA categories in item design[40], while another lacked temporal specification [39]. Fur-
ther, no measurement tools have assessed short- and long-term concurrent use of CHAs, which is
an important consideration due to the heterogeneity of potential effects for individual approaches
among those with one or more pain conditions. Existing, available tools measure use of CHAs,
including intake of dietary supplements alone[45­50], and those using a variety of CHAs for any
purpose but not specifically for pain within 30 days[33, 34], 3 months[35], 12 months[31­37, 41­
44], and at any point in an individual's lifetime[33, 34, 36]. Though otherwise helpful, these assess-
ments do little to provide differentiation between pain-related and non-pain use; attributing the
overall use of CHAs to those with diagnosed pain conditions alone likely results in the misclassifi-
cation of outcomes, resulting in biased estimates regarding the prevalence of CHAs used specifi-
cally for pain and related symptoms. In addition, participant use of CHAs for specific health
conditions is captured by the largest ongoing national survey [33, 34]. However, participants may
perhaps be less likely to report their CHA use for one or more specific complex pain conditions
and more likely to report only for associated individual symptoms. The resulting variability to
pain-specific prevalence estimates, coupled with a lack of short and self-administered tools to
assess CHA use specifically for pain rather than by disease or overall use, indicates a gap in our
knowledge regarding CHA use for pain. Because the utilization of CHAs for pain may be associ-
ated with potential behavior change regarding the use of opioids, a short measurement tool which
utilizes a behavioral theoretical underpinning and assesses distinct stages of behavior change
regarding CHAs used specifically for pain is warranted.
The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is a behavioral theory which proposes that changes in a
health behavior consist of movements between sequences of discrete, qualitatively distinct
stages, characterized by distinct mindsets. Stage progression of behavior change occurs through
6 separate `Stages of Change,' for which specific social-cognitive factors influence stage progres-
sion[51]: Precontemplation (a person has no intention to change a health behavior), Contempla-
tion (they begin to consider changing a health behavior), Preparation (they intend to change
this behavior), Action (initiation of the new health behavior), Maintenance (execution of the
health behavior, sometimes for more than 6 months)[52], and the recently added Termination

(desired health behavior complete)[53]. The `Stage of Change' construct is central to the TTM
[54], and has demonstrated success in cross-sectional research on diet[55, 56], the use of health
care proxies[57], exercise in pain patients[58], physical activity/body satisfaction[59], and can-
cer prevention behaviors[60]. The Stages of Change serves as an ideal framework to consider as
development guidance for the measurement of CHAs used for pain, since differing stage status
may indicate varying levels of influence on conventional treatment and may also reflect differ-
ent risks to patient safety. Differing stage status, which may be obtained by asking participants
about health behaviors by differing lengths of time (each corresponding to a specific stage), may
aid in understanding distinctions between short- and long-term use of CHAs for pain, an area
which has been largely unexplored.
Information on patient CHA use is not routinely or systematically collected in the clinic set-
ting [61, 62], and patients often do not disclose concurrent use of CHAs to their physicians[63,
64], although such CHA use may influence conventional treatments and pose risks to patient
safety [65]. Thus, adverse events may be under-reported to relevant databases (i.e., the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System). Alternatively, the potential
therapeutic benefits of short- or long-term use of certain CHAs as primary or adjunctive treat-
ments for pain management may remain largely unrecognized. Thus, improved understanding
regarding not only the patterns of CHA use in patients with chronic pain, but the risks and
benefits associated both with short- and long-term CHA use and with concurrent use of spe-
cific CHAs and medications is clearly needed. An easy to use, validated instrument that cap-
tures key information on patient CHA use, which can be readily administered by health care
staff in a clinical setting, would provide an effective way to address the challenges of patient
non-disclosure [66­77] and aid physicians in better assessing the risks and benefits of CHA
use in patients with chronic pain. A validated instrument capturing short- and long-term
CHA use would improve understanding and therapeutic potential in this population, and ulti-
mately, help reduce risk for adverse events and optimize pain management. Due in part to its
demonstrated success measuring changes in various health behaviors, the TTM Stages of
change serves as an ideal underlying theoretical framework to gauge the prevalence and pat-
terns of short- and long-term CHA use for pain management, and perhaps further assess the
"readiness" or receptivity of a patient with respect to non-pharmacologic therapies for pain
management.
The overall aim of this study was to create and validate the first systematically-designed
instrument to assess sociodemographic and health factors by CHA use for pain. This aim was
achieved by accomplishing the following objectives:
1. Design a new measurement tool to capture short- and long-term use of CHAs used specifi-
cally for pain among adult patients seeking conventional care for pain management;
2. Assess face validity of this tool among content experts and stakeholders, followed by pre-test-
ing and implementation of survey in an Appalachian population experiencing pain; and,
3. Implement and assess reliability of the SF-GPS and the CHAs by TTM stage.

Scope of Project
This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June 2014 through March 2016 in a sam-
ple of 301 English-speaking adult (!18 years) patients in four Northern WV pain and rheuma-
tology clinics (Fig 1). We conducted primary data collection using a new measurement tool, the

and codebook are freely available as S1 Dataset and S1 Codebook), and included use of the
SF-GPS[6] to measure pain severity and related characteristics. The CHAPS was implemented
using consecutive sampling (response rate across 343 patients in all clinics = 88.0%) to investi-
gate the associations between a variety of demographic, lifestyle, and health factors with 12 sepa-
rate CHAs for pain management in a population seeking conventional care for pain. This study
was deemed exempt by the West Virginia University IRB (#1403248198). Details regarding sur-
vey development and content, study population, and survey administration are below.

Underpinning: Transtheoretical Model. Patient engagement of CHA use may be consid-
ered as a health behavior [78]. Thus, we employed the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) as a
guide for survey development with regard to CHA-specific questions. As far as we know, the
TTM Stages of Change have not yet been applied to measure the health behavior of CHA use.
Because chronic pain is defined as pain lasting from 3­6 months [1], and many CHAs likely
have long-term rather than short-term (e.g., two weeks) effects [79], a 6-month cutoff was
established as an appropriate collective short-term and long-term cutoff which could be used
for each separate approach. Further, the 6-month cutoff has been used in previous TTM-based
survey development for other health behaviors as described [55­60].
We adapted each stage to represent differing lengths of time participants used each CHA
[54, 80] for pain based on previous literature[81]: "I do not know what this is;" "No, and I do
not intend to within 6 months (Precontemplation);" "No, but I intend to within 6 months
(Contemplation);" "No, but I intend to within 30 days (Preparation);" "Yes, and I have for less
than 6 months (Action; i.e., short-term CHA use);" and, "Yes, I have for more than 6 months
(Maintenance; i.e., long-term CHA use)." Additionally, researchers have indicated projects
applying the TTM should include investigation of problem severity[80]; our approach to mea-
suring problem severity of pain was through the administration of the SF-GPS[6] alongside
our TTM-based CHA tool. Ideally, the CHAPS was designed to accompany a variety of pain
measurement tools, since their use is not uniform in practice across disciplines.
Survey Development. Initial development of the CHAPS incorporated input from a panel,
including: CHA researchers, survey methodologists, a clinical therapist specializing in opioid-
dependence, a psychologist, and members of the WV population. The CHAPS included 2
closed-ended items regarding past and present chronic pain, with an accompanying definition
as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks; demographics and lifestyle questions (10 and 6 items,
respectively); previous diagnosis of 24 health conditions (including nine known to cause pain)
and other health factors (3 items); 12 separate CHAs using the TTM underpinning as described,
and, open-ended questions regarding specific herbs and other CHAs we may have inadvertently
omitted (2 items). Our list of CHAs was derived by visually scanning the National Institutes of
Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NIH NCCIH) website[82]
and existing cross-sectional surveys on overall CHA use [31­44] to create a master list of rele-
vant terms, followed by the elimination of CHAs we believed would not be accessible in some
rural settings (i.e. Ayurvedic treatments, Naturopathy) or those which may be easily misinter-
preted (i.e., inclusion of a commercial caloric restriction program such as Weight Watchers1
as `special diets'). Previous psychometric testing of NHIS CHA categories in a national sample
using CHAs determined that overlap of individual approaches into broader categories (i.e.,
Mind-body) was present[83]; when further considering our list was already limited to individ-
ual approaches for which accessibility was likely to be an issue, we concluded that we would not
create broader definitions for separate group classifications. We inquired about natural prod-
ucts `Herbs/Botanicals' (also using a definition from the NIH NCCIH), `Vitamins/minerals,'
`Probiotics,' and `Other Natural products,' as well as `Acupuncture,' `Massage therapy,' `Spinal
manipulation/Chiropractic,' `Tai Chi/Qi Gong,' `Yoga,' `Meditation,' `Other relaxation prac-
tices,' and `Movement therapies.' Accompanying examples (e.g., "Herbs. . .such as Echinacea,
Black Cohosh, etc.") were also included to minimize potential misclassification and ensure the
incorporation of many self-administered and all core practitioner-based CAM therapies recom-
mended for inclusion by the Members of the International Society for Complementary Medi-
cine Research[84]. We did not incorporate specific questions about marijuana use due to
sensitivity concerns. For conciseness, we did not ask about energy healing or specific religious

practices, for which a wide variety of types exist. Twelve optional, nested questions regarding
perceived efficacy of CHAs were also included.
Data Collection Protocol. CHAPS data collection protocols were standardized before
implementation, and team members were given opportunities to practice engaging in dialogue
before approaching patients. A cover page was attached to every survey, indicating the intent
of the research study and ensuring anonymity; return of the survey served as implied informed
consent. The CHAPS was designed to be a ninth grade reading level or below according to the
Automated Readability Index[85], and require no more than 15 minutes to complete. Study
personnel observed the timing of !75% administered surveys; the average time for survey
completion of CHAPS and the SF-GPS among clinic patients was approximately 12 minutes.
This was shorter than our anticipated response time, which may have been attributed to the
recurring item format and underutilization of optional efficacy questions within the
questionnaire.
Measurement of Pain. The SF-GPS was developed from the previously-validated Global
Pain Scale (GPS) by its original authors[6] to meet the need for a simplified instrument for use
by clinicians and researchers, while incorporating key elements of many existing pain assess-
ments; these scales were created to capture the multidimensional effects of pain. The original
33-item GPS and 20-item SF-GPS[86] use a variation of the Visual Analog Scale; numbers
0­10 are spaced equidistant from one another on a horizontal line, both ends are defined as
the extreme limits of the parameter (pain severity, etc.), and orientation is from the left (best)
to the right (worst), indicating the impact each measure has had in a participant's life. The
SF-GPS contains 5 items each on pain (`No Pain' = 0 to `Extreme Pain' = 10 for each: Current
pain; best, worst, and average pain in past week; and, average pain in past 3 months), feelings
in past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly Agree' = 10 for each: Afraid, depressed, tired,
anxious, and stressed), clinical outcomes in past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly
Agree' = 10 for each: Trouble sleeping, trouble feeling comfortable, was less independent, was
unable to work, and needed to take more medication), and inability to engage in activities dur-
ing past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly Agree' = 10 for each: Go to store, do chores
at home, enjoy friends and family, exercise (including walking), and participate in favorite
hobbies). In a population of adults with chronic pain, the GPS demonstrated high internal reli-
ability (alpha = .89), appropriate factor loadings within subscales (>.40), and moderate-strong
correlation with similar subscales of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (GPS Pain
subscale with `Present Pain Intensity' = .65), the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain
Inventory (GPS Pain subscale with `Pain Severity' = .79 and `Interference' = .54; GPS Emotions
subscale with `Negative Mood' = .67 and `Self Control' = -.53; GPS Clinical Outcomes subscale
with `Pain severity' = .41), and the Perceived Stress Scale (GPS Emotions subscale = .62)[6].
The SF-GPS is freely available and has been described in greater detail elsewhere[6].
Survey implementation
Pilot testing period. After obtaining provider permission and obtaining exemption status
from the West Virginia University IRB, we piloted the survey in a convenience sample of pain
patents attending the WVU Medicine Pain clinic in Morgantown, WV (June 2014 through
March 2015). We placed a stack of surveys, pens, and a survey drop box in the waiting room;
during the following 9 months, we visited every 2­3 weeks to collect surveys, and ensure sur-
veys and pens were replenished. A total of 66 patients completed surveys during this period,
including 28 during one in-person visit, where we solicited patient participation in the survey.
This preliminary version of the CHAPS was also pilot-tested in 11 patients by two investiga-
tors to assess comprehension and quality, including clarity and recall[87]. Items and survey

formatting were evaluated during a 5-minute interview using nine pre-determined questions
pertaining to five fundamental components of the effectiveness of a survey[88]. These incl-
uded: 1) attractiveness, 2) comprehension, 3) acceptability, 4) self-involvement, and 5) persua-
sion (Table 1). Based on responses and other feedback, and after learning more about the
patient experience through a 20-hour clinical immersion (accompanying a lead physician in
patient rooms at the WVU Medicine Pain clinic), we made minor formatting changes to the
CHAPS to improve clarity, and included (each) an additional question about prescription
drug use, medical diagnoses we may have overlooked, perceived CHA efficacy, and military
status. We then piloted this final survey version (described below) in 11 additional patients at
the same clinic location.
Final Version. Panel members who provided initial input regarding CHAPS development
were re-approached to assess face validity of the final survey version. The final CHAPS survey
comprised 69 self-report items and used an easily-identifiable response pattern. Commensu-
rate to the preliminary version, items included demographic, lifestyle, and health factors (10, 6,
and 25-items, respectively) and questions regarding CHAs used for pain; the latter were struc-
tured in a manner consistent with surveys utilizing a Stages of Change approach[55, 57­59,
81]. Additionally, the CHAPS incorporated 4 open-ended questions regarding additional
CHA use, diagnoses, and prescriptions used for pain. The final survey version was

vey administration required 10­12 minutes.
Target study population and identification of sampling locations. Site selection is
described in Fig 1. Our target study population was comprised of adult patients seeking con-
ventional care for pain, and attending WV pain management or rheumatology clinics within a
100-mile radius of Morgantown, WV. Rheumatology clinics were selected for inclusion due to
their high prevalence of patients with chronic pain[89]. Pain and rheumatology clinics were
identified by conducting internet searches for physicians within 100 miles of the CHAPS office
(May through July 2015). Due to rurality and limited resources, it would not have been feasible
to stratify sampling of clinics from specific areas in WV.
Of the 15 and 91 rheumatology and pain management practices identified, respectively, non-
pain specializing physicians were excluded, as were multidisciplinary practices including special-
ties other than pain or rheumatology; also excluded were opthamologists, podiatrists, neurosur-
geons, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and weight centers, leaving 9 and 30 eligible rheumatology
and pain clinics, respectively. After exclusion of duplicates, we engaged clinic managers or lead
physicians from each clinic in an effort to describe the study, secure permission to visit, and
administer the survey to patients in waiting rooms. A total of 4 eligible clinics (1 rheumatology
and 3 pain management) located in 4 West Virginia counties agreed to participate. Managers
from each participating clinic signed a consent form which briefly described the study purpose,
stated study investigators would neither disrupt clinic practice nor provide any medical advice,
and provided IRB information (#1403248198) and the primary contact information for the
CHAPS study coordinator. Our resources allowed for 24 total clinic visits throughout the study.
Clinic visits. Our presence was not advertised in clinics. All surveys were self-adminis-
tered with the exception of 14 (4.7%), which were completed by a proxy; we also assisted with
personal interview format requests (n = 6, 2.0%). Upon return, each survey was stored in a
locked filing cabinet in our research coordinator's office. During all phases of data collection,
we also engaged with clinic administrative staff, ensuring they were familiar with our study
objectives; this facilitated return of surveys taken back into the patient rooms.
Statistical analysis
Feedback from nine pre-determined questions relating to quality/comprehension of both survey
versions was elicited, and Fisher's chi-square tests were used to examine differences in responses
across versions and clinic location. We did not conduct internal reliability or factor analysis for
all the Stages of Change-based CHA items combined due to inherently distinct differences bet-
ween stages[81]. However, we were able to use Cronbach's alpha to establish internal reliability
on each Stage of Change subscale, each with 12 CHA items, for whether a participant was in that
particular Stage of Change (coded yes/no). Cronbach's alpha was also used to establish the inter-
nal reliability of the total SF-GPS, in addition to each 5-item subscale Pain, Clinical outcomes,
Activities, and Feelings as described above.
In order to assess if our tool was appropriately written to discourage systematic item-miss-
ing patterns, we examined the final dataset for missing data patterns (PROC MI; SAS 9.4,
Cary, NC) using the missing data indicator matrix for missing data patterns[90, 91]; We did
this in order to examine the most- to least-common missing data patterns by item for patterns
consistent with non-response, sensitive item(s), and attrition. Consistent missing data patterns
would indicate a missing data mechanism such as missing not at random (MNAR) data, which
would indicate multiple imputation (MI) to be inappropriate for recovering missing informa-
tion. Missing data indicators were also examined in conjunction with present demographic
data, again to assist in determining presence of MNAR data. Once we determined the presence

of missing at random or completely at random data instead of MNAR data, we conducted sen-
sitivity analyses in order to determine whether there were differences in data with MI in the
relationships between all sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors with CHA use using
logistic and linear regression using PROC MI ANALYZE.
Results
Response rates were high (88% ± 4.1%) ranging from 84 to 94% in the four sites sampled. Spe-
cific reasons for refusal included reluctance to fill out paperwork (18.8%), hand pain (12.5%),
or visual impairment (12.5%).
Overall, quality/comprehension of both survey versions was strong (Table 1). The only
changes which occurred between versions were simple font format changes (i.e., darker, bolder
print) to ensure readability, and the addition of new questions to capture information we
believed we initially overlooked (Veteran status, etc.); there were no changes to the content or
wording of questions themselves. Further, there were no differences in overall CHA use by sur-
vey version, (pilot) test sample, or clinic location (Fisher's p's > .05). Based upon the positive
feedback from our subsamples, and the vast similarity of preliminary and final CHAPS ver-
sions on all other factors assessed in the survey (i.e., age, sex, race, etc.; p's ! .05), data were
pooled for analysis.
Qualitative data
Scale development and assumptions. Despite our high response rates, some items had
relatively high rates of missing data, including herbal use (18.3%), BMI (11.6%), alcohol (11%),
and income (12.3%). However, there were no consistent visual subgroup patterns of missing
data, suggesting missing data were likely missing at random or missing completely at random.
Further sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of missing data on the rela-
tionships of many potential correlates with CHA use for pain; we compared estimates using
non-imputed data with multiple imputed data using the Fully Conditional Specification
method[92]; estimates were unchanged (not shown), further demonstrating that no factors
assessed in the survey were associated with systematic missing data, thus suggesting the appro-
priateness of MI.
Results indicated very high internal consistency for the SF-GPS[6] (Cronbach's alpha over-
all = .93); the internal reliability of each (5-question) subscale was also high (Cronbach's alpha
for the Pain subscale = .89; Feelings subscale = .87; Clinical Outcomes subscale = .83; Activities
subscale = .91). There was satisfactory internal reliability for each of the five TTM stages for all
(twelve) combined CHA measurements: precontemplation (0.89), contemplation (0.72), prep-
aration (0.75), action (0.70), and maintenance (0.70).
Descriptive statistics
Sample Characteristics are displayed in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Study participants were predomi-
nantly white (92.0%), female (56.9%), and married or cohabitating (57.5%) (Table 2). Partici-
pant age ranged from 22 to 88 years, averaging 55.6 (SD = 13.6) years (Table 2). Over 40% of
participants were disabled (43%; Table 2) and/or obese (44%, mean BMI = 33.4±31.5; Table 3),
and over 55% reported no exercise during the last month (Table 3). Nearly half did not con-
sume alcohol within the past year (46.8%) (Table 3). The majority of our sample (93%) was
experiencing (chronic) pain for twelve weeks or more at the time of survey completion, and
had five or more health conditions (56%, Mean = 5.4±3.1) (Table 3). Additionally, 44% used
opioids and 31% used other prescription medications (Table 3), while 66% used at least one
CHA for pain, with 48% using at least one CHA for greater than 6 months (Table 4). Although

within 6 months (Table 4).
Challenges to data collection
Our team faced many challenges in data collection. Difficulty in cancellations due to inclement
weather, broken clinic equipment, clinic lockdown, and those related to litigation/suspension
of physician licensure resulted in low sampling on a number of scheduled days. We

often expressed concern regarding limited waiting room time. However, the majority of those
indicating concern were willing to complete our survey after we told them they could continue
completion in patient rooms, if that was their preference. Although we made every effort to
avoid sampling from the same patient population, 4/347 patients approached stated they had
completed the survey previously.
Discussion
Although overall CHA use has been examined in a variety of populations[93­101], the CHAPS
is the first concise measurement tool designed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of
CHA use specifically for pain, by length of use. The CHAPS is flexible in that it may be used
alongside different pain measurement tools by clinicians and researchers, in addition to other
tools designed to measure patient expectations of CHAs[102]. Individual patient pain out-
comes vary greatly, propelling efforts toward precision medicine[103]; the CHAPS may serve
as a time-saving approach to assess patient CHA use for pain. This may be of particular interest
for clinicians possessing openness in identifying individual patient response for non-pharma-
cological approaches as adjuncts to conventional pain management strategies, as the limited
evidence base for these approaches is mostly positive but remains inconclusive[79]. Further,
clinicians unfamiliar with several types of CHAs may particularly benefit from use of the
CHAPS, since information regarding (evidence-based) CHA practices are not consistently
integrated into medical school curricula despite their wide use by a variety of patient popula-
tions[104, 105]. For example, nearly half of our rural sample were long-term users of CHAs
specifically for pain.
Findings of this pilot study suggest that the CHAPS was readily understandable, acceptable,
and feasible to implement in chronic pain patients in WV, and that the SF-GPS, a measure-
ment tool designed to capture the multidimensional experience of pain, was reliable for gaug-
ing the impact of pain. The GPS, from which the SF-GPS originated, is a valid measurement
tool with high internal reliability; interestingly, reliability coefficients for the SF-GPS in the
current study were higher than those previously reported in a sample of college students[6],
perhaps reflecting in part differences in population characteristics. In addition, we only
assessed approaches believed available in Appalachian rural settings. However, future use of
the CHAPS may benefit from the addition or substitution of other CHAs available in different
settings.
Although selection bias due to non-response is possible, our use of consecutive sampling,
coupled with the high survey response rates, render non-response bias less likely. As in many
studies using self-report data, there is also a possibility of recall bias. Researchers wishing to
implement the CHAPS or similar surveys should explore barriers to survey implementation
present at specific clinics, partially by considering attitudes of the clinic staff and working
together to facilitate involvement, as well as considering the available physical space.
Conclusions
The CHAPS is the first measurement tool to assess correlates of CHA use specifically for pain,
and was successfully pilot-tested and implemented in a population with pain. The CHAPS
included comprehensive information on a range of factors and constructs, yet required only
12 minutes to complete, and may thus be appropriate for use in future population- and clinic-
based survey studies assessing CHA use in patients with chronic pain. Robust survey response
rates and high face validity further support use of the CHAPS as a measurement tool in rural
populations with chronic pain.
