Special Issue - Ethnogerontology
Florence, a Latinx elderly patient, is grieving the recent loss
of her husband. She is taking care of her teenage grandchild,
identifies herself as a member of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay,
bisexual, trans, and questioning) community, suffers from
numerous health challenges, is economically vulnerable,
lives in an increasingly gentrified multi-ethnic neighbor-
hood, and is in the early stages of dementia.
More than likely, even the best health care professional
will not be able to fully meet Florence's multiple needs.
Limited resources exacerbated by the restrictions of overly
specialized knowledge, fragmented services, compounded
social stigma, underprepared and culturally unresponsive
health professionals, and confounding Medicare and
Medicaid policy directives make effective treatment under
these circumstances nearly impossible (Hill, 2015; Turner,
Hinton, Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2015; Urbaska,
Szczeniak, & Rymaszewska, 2015). In the case of an eco-
nomically vulnerable elder like Florence, the marginalizing
effects of compounded stigma are known to have serious
consequences, especially when her sexually underrepre-
sented identity is considered (Jones, 2002; Merton, 1968;
Robinson-Wood & Weber, 2016). Marginalization leads to
depression and depression may increase suicide ideation
(Almeida, Flicker, & Rees, 2014; see also Collier, 2005;
Robinson-Wood & Weber, 2016).
Less than responsive social service environments, perme-
ated by ageism and discrimination based on sexual orienta-
tion, are known to further exacerbate the hardships of elderly

Abstract
This article highlights social work, critical thinking, and an ethic of care in geriatric teamwork to promote generativity
and the well-being of LatinX elderly. We offer the tripartite paradigm of cultural humility, transformative complicity, and
empowerment to reduce power imbalances between service providers, elderly persons, and their communities. A force
field analysis considers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPAC) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACO)
to understand the restraining and driving forces affecting the institutionalization of inter/transdisciplinary teams. Effective
evidence-based models that humanize geriatric services are offered to counter the current biomedical emphasis of Medicare/
Medicaid policies and less-than-responsive geriatric institutional and educational systems. We highlight Bloom and Farragher's
Sanctuary Model of compassionate and democratic practices to address the negative effects of moral entrepreneurship and
ageism. The case of Florence, an LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and questioning) grandparent with multiple health
issues, is analyzed from biomedical, person in the environment, and a strength-based perspective.

persons and their families (Bloom & Farragher, 2013;
Hodgins & Greve, 2004; Pasupathi, Carstensen, Tsai, Lott, &
Maluso, 1995). These circumstances often foster increased
misunderstanding, neglect, and elder abuse in the home and
in social service agencies more generally (Phelan, 2008).
Florence, in effect, experiences cumulative disadvantage
which, if not dealt with systemically, can lead to deeper and
highly serious repercussions (Merton, 1968).
To effectively address these concerns, we discuss the need
for cultural humility (Ortega & Duntley-Matos, 2014; Ortega
& Faller, 2011; Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998), transfor-
mative complicity (Duntley-Matos, 2014; Newberry,
Duntley-Matos, Shiery, Brass, & Beu, 2014), and a system-
based empowerment approach (Gutiérrez & Ortega, 1991).
We review the changing age-based demographics of LGBTQ
and Latinx elderly populations, the history and present cir-
cumstances of geriatric teams from a force field analytical
perspective, the shift in cost as we move to team-based home
care, the relevance of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (PPAC), and its policy of Accountable Care
Organizations (ACO). Finally, we discuss Bloom and
Farragher's (2013) Sanctuary Model to reframe Florence's
journey with a strength's based, person in the environment
(PIE) perspective that is caring, democratic, and culturally
responsive. The STAR-VA, Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors
(MSVD) community-based inter/transdisciplinary dementia-
focused programs, and the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian
Center's Senior Services Program are discussed as cost- and
clinically- effective examples of culturally responsive and
empowering care for Latinx LGBTQ elderly persons.
The Elderly: National Demographics
and Changing Health Care Needs
The current and future influx of Baby Boomers (babies born
after World War II, approximately between 1946 and 1964,
continues to impose new challenges and changes in health
care services. According to Szwabo (2012),
[T]he frail elderly [are] growing the fastest. In the United States,
the 85+ age group will triple to 19 million by 2050. Worldwide,
the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that . . . there
are 4 million elders over the age of 85 years. (p. 44)
Within this population, Latinx elderly are of special concern,
given their rapid growth and the heightened rate of dementia.
Turner et al. (2015) alert us to these concerning trends:
Latinx elderly patients are particularly vulnerable . . . as they are
1.5 times more likely than non-Hispanic [European Americans]
to be diagnosed.
LGBTQ elderly are known to suffer additional social stigma,
health disparities, and human rights violations. There are
2,000,000 older adults in the United States that self-identify
as LGBTQ, and 4.3% of them are Latinxs (Harley, 2016).
They are expected to reach 4,000,000 by 2030 (Zelle &
Arms, 2015). From a social exchange perspective (Sabatelli
& Shehan, 1993), the value and worth of this population is
underappreciated and often leads to a breakdown in self-
esteem exacerbated by unresponsive elder care.
As demonstrated in the case of Florence, symptoms and
conditions exhibited by Latinx elderly are multiple, co-mor-
bid, and require an exhaustive assessment of medical, behav-
ioral, and social supports. Some of the physiological and
social symptoms experienced by persons like her include
visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and/or financial diffi-
culties that can significantly affect quality of life. Latinxs are
predisposed to diabetes. In addition, they can experience
environmentally induced illnesses and disabilities from
dehumanizing labor conditions such as excessive noise and
chemical toxicity from inhumane work environments that
may have promoted hearing loss and other problems (Hong,
Chin, & Kerr, 2015).
Because of society's emphasis on status, economic inde-
pendence, and employability, the elderly are often victims of
discrimination, invisibility, and dependence within a national
culture that ignores the social cohesion and collective wis-
dom they offer the community and younger generations
(Butler, 2013; Carr, Fried, & Rowe, 2015). Although Latinxs
tend to experience greater longevity due to strong family and
community networks of support, their use of health services
often occurs in contexts of marginalization and disregard
compounded by provider-induced ageism and ethnocen-
trism. Ill-informed and deficit-based policies negatively tar-
get Latinxs, and minimize their sense of worth, normalcy,
and "productivity" (Abela, 2015; Bullock, 2004; Carr et al.,
2015; Hayslip, Maiden, & Dolbin-MacNab, 2015; Hayslip &
Smith, 2013; Hou, 2015; Kelly & Damato, 1995; Turner
et al., 2015).
Humanizing social and health care services implies
addressing the needs of elderly patients from their perspec-
tive (and that of their loved ones) in a kinder and more
responsive way (Newberry et al., 2014). Given the complex-
ity of their socio-psychological and health profiles, health
care teams are crucial to elderly well-being. Despite the long
history of such arrangements, however, instituting inter/
transdisciplinary teams has yet to become standard practice.
History of Geriatric Teams
In the United States, the use of geriatric health care teams
dates back to WWII (Behm & Gray, 2011). These teams
gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s as a response to
the bed blockages that transpired in hospitals. Large numbers
of debilitated elderly patients, who no longer required acute
care, remained awaiting nursing home placements (Wieland,
Kramer, Waite, & Rubenstein, 1996). Common geriatric
teams of that era arose in Veterans Administration facilities,
teaching hospitals, and later in skilled nursing arenas. Known
as Geriatric Consultation Teams or Geriatric Evaluation and
Management Teams, they evolved as a response to the
Duntley-Matos et al. 3
incapacity of hospitals to address the rapidly growing elderly
population.
Different models of geriatric teamwork have developed
that vary in organizational structure and roles, levels of com-
munication, and interaction between members. The models
used for teamwork are important as they can make a substan-
tial difference in how care is approached and administered
and how it can affect the overall outcome of treatment for
older adults. Treatment teams of any sort are commonly
referred to as multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary, but these
are two among several approaches used in geriatric care. A
multidisciplinary team, for example, is composed of differ-
ent professionals that work independently performing disci-
pline-specific assessments, plans of care, and goals (Behm &
Gray, 2011; Galvin, Valois, & Zweig, 2014). Team members
have limited communication with each other, share findings,
and progress with other members in formal team meetings or
in writing (Behm & Gray, 2011; Galvin et al., 2014; Wieland
et al., 1996).
Interdisciplinary teams, however, are more common in
rehabilitation settings where various professionals are on
staff and come together on predetermined dates to discuss
the case of a client from each perspective. Team members
inform each other about how they are addressing an issue
while minimizing overlap. The level of client engagement
within team decisions varies from context to context, and
collaborative efforts are more common when there is a need
to agree on behavioral interventions across professional/cli-
ent interactions. In both multidisciplinary and interdisciplin-
ary team approaches, hierarchies between professionals can
be more or less evident through the differential use of titles,
predominance/privilege of voice of some professionals over
others, and the ultimate power over treatment decisions (eth-
nographic data, Duntley-Matos, 2014).
A more recent team approach is referred to as transdisci-
plinary. This model offers a more integrated and ideal col-
laborative structure. (Behm & Gray, 2011; Galvin et al.,
2014; Wieland et al., 1996). In transdisciplinary teams, pro-
fessional boundaries flow together to share goals and discuss
client progress (Ellington, 2002; Galvin et al., 2014). Some
team functions may be shared with others, but the ultimate
responsibility belongs to the members with the specialization
needed to address the primary concern (Wieland et al., 1996).
This approach allows independent and collaborative assess-
ments to work in conjunction, while sharing formal and
informal information. Treatment plans are developed
together to address all areas and diagnoses. These teams
require much trust, respect, and confidence in all participants
to be effective. Relationships between members develop
over time from well-functioning and mature practitioners
and represent the most patient-centered, integrated, cultur-
ally responsive, and transformative of the three geriatric
approaches. At times, however, the overlapping roles may
become a source of conflict (Ellington, 2002), especially
when there is a discrepancy between the team and broader
institutional philosophies. It is important to note, however,
that although the team types seem to be distinguished by
clear definitions, the concepts are sometimes used
interchangeably.
Force Field Analysis: Exploring the Driving and
Restraining Forces of Health Care Teams
Using the Force Field Analysis Framework developed by
Kurt Lewin in the 1940s, H. M. Young et al. (2011) list sev-
eral factors that drive and restrain the effective implementa-
tion of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams. In their
discussion, the elderly, their families, "sub-groups [who
share] complexity and risk," and professional organizations
are primary driving forces. In an effort to control costs, busi-
ness and political interests have begun to promote inter/
transdisciplinary health teams in this manner. The PPAC of
2010 is an example of this effort in the political arena. PPAC
emphasizes quality care at reduced cost but, ironically,
reimbursement restrictions have tended to hinder team cre-
ativity by denying payment for the coordination of services
and communication expectations required in these models.
The Affordable Care Act has established beginning attempts
to integrate hospital services in its efforts to reduce costs. It
has instituted disciplinary measures in Medicare reimburse-
ment through its Accountable Care Organizations to pro-
mote proactive prevention of ailments such as falls,
bedsores, and urinary tract infections in hospitals and long-
term care facilities.
Given this, these quality control measures have led to
important improvements in hospital care and cost reduction
(Casalino, Erb, Joshi, & Shortell, 2015; Ellison, White, &
Farrar, 2015; Kessell, Pegany, Keolanui, et al., 2015). More
research is needed, however, to assess their financial and
other consequences on elderly who do not have access to
higher quality hospitals. According to recent qualitative
and focus group-based research, a person such as Florence,
due to her low socioeconomic status (SES), might fall into
this category. Latinx focus group participants have
described how dismissed they can feel by medical practitio-
ners and health professionals when seeking services for
their elderly family members. In addition, compounded
stigma resulting from ethnic and LGBTQ identity is often
sufficient to keep the clients themselves from seeking med-
ical attention. Their difficulties are further exacerbated
when health care professionals are ignorant about the com-
plex needs of multiple subjugated identities (Gratwick,
Jihanian, Holloway, Sanchez, & Sullivan, 2014; Oswald, &
Masciadrelli, 2008; Pasupathi et al., 1995; Turner et al.,
2015). It is for this reason that the Partnership for Health
and Aging sponsored by the American Geriatric Society
(Young et al., 2011) has convened 20 participating organi-
zations to improve elder care. They hope to "coordinate
(end-of-life care), interdisciplinary team care; caregiver
support; and healthcare systems and benefits" (Young,
et al., 2011, Driving and Restraining Forces in
Interdisciplinary Collaboration, Chart).

Addressing Cost by Shifting to Interdisciplinary
and Transdisciplinary Teams
When implemented appropriately, teams have been found to
have the potential for being more cost-effective (Little,
2010). At this time, however, given the disparate fee-for-
service reimbursement structure of Medicare and Medicaid,
and the high cost of medical treatment and supplies, team
interventions have not reached broad implementation. For
this reason the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
(CCMI) has been seeking strategies to offer bundled pay-
ments that will support interdisciplinary and transdisci-
plinary teams to improve cost and clinical effectiveness with
elderly patients who remain in their homes (Davis et al.,
2015). However, at this point, the bundled payments are
often not sufficient to cover the costs of the specialists
(Newberry, ethnographic interview, June 13, 2016). In spite
of this, well-coordinated client-centered home care, based on
interdisciplinary treatment, is beginning to reveal positive
results that move away from the less effective biomedical
model.
The Bio-Psycho-Social and PIE Approaches
As is apparent, collaborative teams contrast dramatically
with the traditional physician directed model where doctors
are considered the primary "experts" (Ellington, 2002; Little,
2010) and where the costs of care become a substantial
stressor. In the medical field, the biopsychosocial psychiatric
model (Engel, 1977) has been an effective alternative to the
biomedical model (Carr et al., 2012). Its integrated focus
allows for a holistic understanding of the physiological and
environmental variables affecting a person's health. From a
social work perspective, the PIE approach is rooted in sys-
tems theory and promotes the integration of paradigms from
several disciplines. Role theory, an important component of
PIE, addresses the person's behavior, interpersonal relation-
ships, sense of self, the impact of social norms, structures,
and the broader environment in an ongoing process of mutual
transaction and influence (Granucci Lesser, 2011). In this
sense, moving away from a focus on isolated ailments (gen-
erally within the context of fragmented services) improves
client care through a team of professionals who address the
whole person in an integrated fashion.
Evidence-Based Interdisciplinary Programs That
Work
As in the 1940s, there is presently a renewed awareness of
veteran needs that has led to an expanded support for inter-
disciplinary teamwork specifically related to geriatric
dementia.Arecent study with positive results is the STAR-VA
multisite and multicomponent psychosocial program for
managing the challenging behaviors associated with this ill-
ness (Karel, Teri, McConnell, Visnic, & Karlin, 2016). This
interdisciplinary team-based program has proven to reduce
behaviors such as "resistance to care, agitation, violence/
aggression, vocalization, wandering . . . depression, anxiety,"
and others (Karel et al., 2016, Abstract). STAR-VA attributes
part of its success to its use of a simultaneous top-down and
bottom-up approach. The top-down approach includes "high
level organizational and interdisciplinary program leadership
support . . ." The bottom-up mechanism involves "local facil-
ity, [community living center] leadership support, interest
and [aid] from frontline staff and local champions" (Karel
et al., 2016). In effect, this program reduces the need for dan-
gerous and often lethal antipsychotic medications among
elderly veteran patients.
Another successful example is the MSVD program. The
MSVD is composed of physicians, nurse practitioners,
social workers, and administrative assistants. Its interven-
tions have increased the physician's capacity to see patients
by 40%, leading to an estimated revenue increase of
$46,000 that, with the regular charges of the nurse practitio-
ner, offsets the latter's salary. Here, the nurse practitioner
manages complex cases proactively with home visits. The
social worker, because of increases in caseload, handles
part of the intake visits via phone. Weekly team meetings
enable members to address program difficulties and to
make changes leading to better communication and struc-
tural support.
MSVD program researchers observed that satisfaction
with the team approach has remained equally positive despite
the increase in client load per physician. Nonclinical staff
members were able to address concerns that did not require
physician intervention and which were welcomed by patients.
Due to its success, the MSVD is in the process of adopting
this model for its entire practice (Reckrey, Soriano,
Hernández et al., 2015). These incipient efforts, however, do
not offset, at this time, the significant and broader systemic
forces that restrain or prevent the effective implementation
of transdisciplinary teams on a larger scale or in the micro-
practices of individual institutions.
Common and powerfully insidious dynamics within teams
often include turfism among specialists who are uncomfort-
able with blurring professional boundaries, a lack of commu-
nication skills, ineffective teamwork, lack of conflict
resolution skills, and a dearth of training in geriatrics. Such
difficulties not only affect the climate of health care facilities
but also negatively affect the training of students and future
professionals in their higher education institutions (Duntley-
Matos & Newberry, ethnographic data 2013-2016). An addi-
tional problem addressing the needs of the elderly is the
dearth of geriatric concentrations in professional develop-
ment programs. According to Young et al., in 2011, only 4%
of health service practitioners held certificates in this field. At
the present time, there continues to be a substantial shortage.
although there is an increasing number of advertisements in
social work associations and social work programs offering
certificates in geriatrics. However, the gap between the curri-
cula, educational climate, and system restructuration priori-
ties continues to be of serious concern.
Duntley-Matos et al. 5
Important barriers to promoting inter/transdisciplinary teams
include inadequate academic infrastructures, disparate curri-
cula, and schedules characterized by varying student levels in
clinical training. Parallel rather than integrated curricular for-
mats, and budget and building constraints, have also preempted
integrated teaching. Currently, a culture of traditional values
that reward individual exceptionality, competition, and distrust,
rather than openness, dialog, problem-based learning, and col-
laborative teaching, is most common in health service provision
(Young, 1998, Duntley-Matos, 2013-2016 ethnographic data).
Thus, in the United States, the use of geriatric interdisci-
plinary and transdisciplinary teams has been slow to evolve.
Today, with short hospital stays, there is an increasing need
for outpatient clinics and care in home settings. This has led
to the development of outpatient teams that provide nonacute
care (Burns, Nichols, Graney, & Cloar, 1995; Donald,
Baldwin, & Bannerjee, 1995; Wieland et al., 1996), but
which require a collaborative emphasis to be effective. Such
options continue to be explored and, in some cases, man-
dated to address the restraining forces discussed thus far.
From a Force Field Analysis then, it has become evident
that there continue to be more restraining than driving forces
geared toward change. This explains why transdisciplinary
teamwork is struggling to take hold on a broad scale. Working
in collaborative teams to improve geriatric care requires a
willingness to leave egos at the door, to be open to continu-
ous learning, to focus on trust building, and to develop the
ability to adapt and compromise. Above all, however, it
requires the political prioritization of our elderly, the valida-
tion of their different cultural and identity needs, a change in
health service provision values, and creative institutional
funding and support.
It is in this context, where most health and social service
agencies experience difficulty serving someone like Florence,
that the paradigms of cultural humility, transformative com-
plicity, and systems-based empowerment become relevant.
Cultural Humility, Transformative Complicity, and
Empowerment in Interdisciplinary Teams
The implementation of the team approach in medical care
takes effort and time, but is highly effective in the long run
for the institution and the client. Although the transdisci-
plinary team is the ideal model for working with a geriatric
population (Little, 2010), our previous discussion on driving
and restraining forces, considered in the context of pervasive
discriminatory ideologies, reveals why actual implementa-
tion is difficult. It is clear that interdisciplinary teams (Behm
& Gray, 2011; Wieland et al., 1996) are the most common
and closest model to transdisciplinarity under current bio-
medical institutional, structural, and ideological constraints.
Effectiveness with Latinx geriatric patients can be improved
substantially, however, if a cultural humility approach
(Duntley-Matos et al., 2015; Ortega & Faller, 2011; Tervalon
& Murray-Garcia, 1998) becomes the guiding framework.
Cultural humility values the experiential knowledge of
the service recipient and family system, as well as the view-
points of fellow health providers working collaboratively to
reduce power imbalances in the caring relationship. A cultur-
ally humble approach is keenly aware of how personal biases
and cultural stereotypes influence caring practices, are often
presumptive of cultural competence, and may result in detri-
mental therapeutic interventions. Cultural humility enables
team members to transcend from a position of "expert knowl-
edge" to one of ongoing mutual exploration and learning.
The multidimensional appreciation of the team via cultural
humility enables collaborators to work together for the good
of the whole person rather than limiting understanding to the
most apparent medical symptoms. In the case of Florence
and her grandchild, engaging in mutually open teamwork
and valuing the multidimensionality of all identities enables
all team members, including the service recipients, to become
collaborators.
Transformative complicity (Duntley-Matos, 2014;
Duntley-Matos et al., 2015; Newberry et al., 2014) requires a
careful analysis of the structural, ideological, and behavioral
participation of each member (and of the health service orga-
nization itself) in the social oppression of vulnerable groups.
It seeks to address the political, cultural, and economic ide-
ologies that target these populations within the daily func-
tioning of the health care system. As highlighted by Cousins
(2009), such ideologies are often based on moral entrepre-
neurship leading to serious political, institutional, and inter-
personal repercussions. Reductive elder care policies, for
example, promote the cognitive shortcuts that lead to damag-
ing stereotypes, marginalization, and neglect.
[Moral entrepreneurship] . . . define[s] the parameters of
policymaking in the context of [institutions] and communities . .
. [It] often dominate[s] . . . public processes and discourses . . .
In the bargain, society gets a simple, sturdy understanding of
social problems and morality to which all (but in reality mostly
those with little power and cultural capital) must adhere or risk
being excluded, treated and or punished. (p. 95)
As discussed in the STAR-VA and MSVD programs,
community-based interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
teams that strive to reduce costs, hospitalization, readmis-
sions, and to promote a higher quality of life are potentially
powerful mechanisms for deconstructing and reducing the
effects of moral entrepreneurship. Through tracking harms
(Robison & Reeser, 2000), practicing patient impatience
(Freire, 1970), and engaging in shared calculated risks
(Duntley-Matos, 2014), complicity can be decreased in the
stigmatization of Latinx LGBTQ elderly as team collabora-
tors navigate the gray areas of bureaucratic practices and
policies.
Transformative complicity moves team members from
guilt and denial into positive change and action by requiring
critical self and institutional awareness to address the contra-
dictions between client-centered discourses and oppressive
6 SAGE Open
practices. Team members are able to detect harmful dis-
courses and to address them proactively and reactively rather
than remaining silent to appease institutional authoritarian-
ism that perpetuates ignorance. Ongoing open dialog is more
likely to reduce institutional harms and promote positive cli-
ent- and family-centered adaptations. As a result, empower-
ment at the personal, interpersonal, and political levels,
within and beyond the institution, is more probable (Gutiérrez
& Ortega, 1991).
The Social Worker Role in Transdisciplinary
Teams
Each discipline participating in a health care team has a spe-
cific role to fulfill even when boundaries are more fluid in
nature. According to the National Association of Social
Workers (2013, as defined by Barker, 2003),
Social workers help people increase their capacities for problem
solving and coping . . . [to] obtain needed resources, facilitate
interactions between individuals . . . people and their
environments . . . [T]hey may work at a systems level on
regulations and policy development, or as administrators and
planners of large social service systems. (http://www.naswdc.
org/practice/intl/definitions.asp)
Social workers, ideally, work to humanize all needed aspects
of treatment by helping individual clients and communities
maintain an acceptable quality of life through the reduction
of oppression, marginalization, and social injustice.
The reality, however, is that the shortage of health care
providers who possess geriatric training and the concerning
deficit-based views held by many professionals about the
elderly, Latinxs, and LGBTQ populations plague the social
work field. For example, ageist attitudes of social work stu-
dents, faculty, and practitioners are not uncommon. A study
by Allen, Cherry, and Palmore (2009) found that "undergrad-
uate and graduate social work students and practicing social
service providers in the nursing home and mental health set-
ting . . . readily admit[ed] to positive ageist behaviors"
(Abstract). Similarly, Woodford, Brennan, Gutiérrez, and
Luke (2013) discussed patterns of behavior seen in graduate
social work faculty that may have "negative, positive, but not
very positive" attitudes toward LGBTQ populations. Patterns
of not including LGBTQ content in the curriculum, and
treating students and colleagues as invisible or in verbally
hostile ways, are all examples of how health service and
social work attitudes can influence professional practice and
client treatment (Woodford et al., 2013).
These hidden negative attitudes must be considered along
with the primary functions and roles of social workers in inter-
disciplinary and transdiciplinary teams as their influence can
be insidious and seriously harmful (Hafferty & O'Donnell,
2015). Social workers commonly provide diagnosis and assess-
ment (bio-psycho-social), care/case management, individual
counseling, group work in psychotherapy and psychoeduca-
tion, liaison services (patient/family/professional community),
and advocacy. They also serve as community resource guides
(Mellor & Lindeman, 1999). Social workers also play a role in
interdisciplinary teams:
[They focus] on memory loss and caregiver issues . . . referrals
for concrete services (transportation services, assistance in the
home, meal delivery and adult day programs) . . . assistance with
transition to alternate care settings . . . psychotherapy and
counseling services (billable services) . . . support programs for
patients and/or caregivers, [collaboration] with local agencies
and organizations, [and provision of] educational resources and
materials. (Galvin et al., 2014, p. 459)
The consequences of not taking a culturally responsive
approach seriously can be devastating for elderly Latinxs and
their caregivers when social workers are not appropriately
educated to develop a culturally humble approach. This is
more so the case when the stigma toward LGBTQ identities
plays a role in institutional discrimination and when social
workers are not taught to think critically about their work. In
fact, Dr. Jean Anastas (2012), former President of the
National Association of Social Workers, published her grave
concerns over the lack of critical thinking skills promoted in
the professional curriculum. A case in point is the stirring
account of Latinx caregivers who have felt neglected by
social workers and other health service professionals (Turner
et al., 2015). The following quote by a focus group partici-
pant reveals detriment to family well-being due to underedu-
cated and experientially underexposed social workers, and to
the lack of critical thinking skills that are necessary to obtain
information for effective care.
"I've told you about the experiences with social workers . . . I've
felt that they know nothing of the illness. They don't get training
[about Alzheimer's disease] . . . they fill out a paper and they do
this and that and then they make notes and comments . . . one
[even] said to me `look I know nothing about [Alzheimer's
disease]. The same caregiver added[:] "I feel [that] they don't
even take the trouble to train the social workers" (p. 458).
As revealed in this quote, in addition to developing the
ability to problem solve, it is important that health service
professionals explore their own values as well as those pre-
sented by their clients. The research of Turner et al. (2015)
revealed a focus on family, patience, tolerance, and love as
common values in the narratives of their focus group partici-
pants. These caregiving priorities are relevant to altruism and
the transgenerational sharing of history in broader LGBTQ
elderly community family networks (Oswald & Masciadrelli,
2008). Interestingly, however, Turner et al. point to a positive
role of the often-criticized biomedical model. In essence, by
separating the illness from the person, the cultural emphasis
on patience, tolerance, and love can remain a strong unifying
caregiving force in the family and community system.
Duntley-Matos et al. 7
At least one social work program responds to these values to
address the specific needs of LGBTQ Latinx elderly by pro-
moting political advocacy and addressing heterosexist dis-
courses in social service intake forms. The Los Angeles Gay
and Lesbian Center's Senior Service Department is advocating
for a change in SB 1729 to include provisions that will ensure
that health professionals working with sexual and gender
minority elders comply with training expectations to promote a
discrimination-free environment (Gratwick et al., 2014).
The program is based on a three-pronged approach:
socialization activities, case management, and cultural safe
spaces training. The activities incorporate shared meals,
computer classes, and social media. They include fall pre-
vention and stress management (yoga, dance, chair Tai Chi),
storytelling and writing, and art and theater. Case manage-
ment includes behavioral management, housing assistance,
food security, referrals, end-of-life planning, and mental
health and legal resources. The program works creatively to
lower costs for this population. It is partnering with the
University of California, Los Angeles, and other California-
based universities to provide energetic and creative social
work intern experiences with LGBTQ populations while
enhancing the Center's LatinX programming for their
Comunidad Latinx group (p. 896). Finally, their cultural safe
spaces training addresses history, barriers to service, chal-
lenges in aging, and practical steps to promote responsive-
ness (Gratwick et al., 2014).
With the aid of programs like the Los Angeles Gay and
Lesbian Center's Senior Services, in collaboration with pro-
grams such as MSVD and STAR-VA, Florence, her family,
and her chosen LGBTQ community can have a stronger
recourse for political advocacy and become active partici-
pants in collective well-being. This increased social capital
can promote empowerment at the personal, interpersonal,
and political levels (Gutiérrez & Ortega, 1991). This is more
likely to reduce the elderly's propensity for isolation and
depression, enhancing, in this way, cognitive abilities while
limiting the need for pharmacological interventions.
Unfortunately, the present reality is that few programs
effectively address the cultural needs of Latinx LGBTQ
elders. This highlights the importance of culturally respon-
sive communication requiring transdisciplinary engagement
with the democratic and empathic emphasis of the Sanctuary
Model (Bloom & Farragher, 2013). This model enables
social workers to be critically aware of pejorative preconcep-
tions and discriminatory structural barriers that undermine
their professional values of emancipation and ethics of care
(Hamington, 2001).
Bloom and Farragher's Trauma Informed System
Sanctuary Model
Bloom and Farragher's (2013) Sanctuary Model of organiza-
tional behavior is based on an extrapolation of clinical work
with patients who suffered institutionally inflicted emotional
trauma. Through ongoing exploration, the researchers dis-
covered that rather than helping patients, the institutional
assumptions about oppositional patient behavior, the puni-
tive interventions, and the isolation of clients from their nat-
ural social networks were, in fact, retraumatizing. This led
them to help clients build networks of support through demo-
cratic, transparent, and caring interactions.
The relevance of the Sanctuary Model to geriatric care is
its humanizing and collaborative intent. It addresses organi-
zational climate difficulties and focuses on stronger caring
social networks to promote bio-psychosocial well-being.
The Sanctuary Model is a powerful way to decrease beliefs
and behaviors that stigmatize older adults. It offers a basis
for preventing the abuse, neglect, and fragmented services
that often compromise the health of elderly patients. More
importantly, however, this model strives to include, in every
way possible, the equal and central participation of clients in
their own care.
The goal of the Sanctuary Model is to define stress as a
public health issue and to reduce toxic dynamics within insti-
tutions (Bloom & Farragher, 2013). In this context, interper-
sonal defense mechanisms characterized by "denial,
coercion, avoidance of conflict, and scapegoating" (p. 16)
parallel equally traumatizing dynamics that cause harmful
climates with serious repercussions on staff relationships and
client care.
A perceived lack of safety erodes trust relationships. Under
these conditions health service organizations see threat rather
than opportunity, pathology rather than strength, and risk rather
than reward. (p. 16)
The Model highlights the difficulty experienced by pro-
fessionals in managing emotions due to constant demands of
empathy, concern, caring, and tolerance resulting from
excessive emotional labor. These are the circumstances that
more likely lead to poor or negligent services. Organizational
toxicity promotes organizational amnesia (p. 17), frag-
mented service delivery, reactive decision making, silencing
of dissent, administrative abuse, lowering of morale,
increased miscommunication, and overall conflict (p. 17).
An empowering organizational culture, on the contrary,
parallels the attachment relationships exhibited in healthy
human development where mental and social well-being are
the rule, not the exception (Bloom & Farragher, 2013). Well-
being implies resilience and the ability to adapt to changing
circumstances while maintaining a purpose that is significant
to the person and their social/institutional context. Healthy
organizations use risk when necessary to promote changes
that benefit workers and clients. They address feelings of
grief and loss openly and empathically while embracing the
real need for growth, change, and creativity. In the case of
the elderly and their staff, they promote well-being while
valuing diversity through democratic interactions. Trust is
promoted through transparency, collaborative decision

making, an ethic of care, and an alignment between stated
values, procedures, and practices. Psychological, moral, and
physical safety are prioritized in the process of building com-
munity. Power is used to advance collective and client goals
rather than to promote personal administrative desires.
Healthy organizations create space to discuss and manage
emotions on a regular basis. They value continued knowl-
edge development gained from open communication. Finally,
healthy organizations emphasize social responsibility, for-
giveness, and social justice. The STAR-VA, MSVD pro-
grams, and the LosAngeles Gay and Lesbian Center's Senior
Services are good examples of a Sanctuary Model approach
that uses cultural humility, transformative complicity, and
system's based empowerment.
Now that we have addressed the implications of organiza-
tional culture, transdisciplinary teamwork, and the greater
good for Latinx geriatric LGBTQ populations, it is important
to revisit and deconstruct Florence's initial biomedically
centered representation. This enables us to appreciate the
value of a PIE perspective and helps us demonstrate how
healthy organizational culture is of essence in the promotion
of teamwork that leads to system's based empowerment for
the elderly.
First, we offer a more detailed description of Florence
from a biomedical perspective, then, as a contrast, we offer a
cultural humility and transformative complicity perspective.
Florence's life is based on a reformulated/composite repre-
sentation based on Wieland et al.'s (1996) work influenced
by the experiences of our co-authors'in geriatric scholarship,
care, and minimalist social work curricula and educational
expectations.
Florence and the Biomedical Perspective From a
Multi-Disciplinary Team Approach
Florence is an 86-year-old Latinx diagnosed with macular
degeneration, heart disease, neuropathy, depression, limited
mobility, dementia, and anxiety. Her husband of 62 years
died 6 months ago. Her only child passed away. She is the
caregiver of her teenage grandchild and is currently living
independently. She has recently disclosed to her neighbors
that she is a member of the LGBTQ community. She is expe-
riencing increasing challenges as time progresses that include
physical limitations, adverse medical conditions, a psychiat-
ric disorder, and loss and grief issues. In addition, she has
experienced ridicule and marginalization from acquaintances
due to her sexual identity.
Florence's team is composed of a nurse, physician, geria-
trician, psychologist, psychiatrist, pharmacist, occupational
therapist, physical therapist, chaplain, dietician, and social
worker, which receive "cultural competency" continuing
education credits once a year. Their training is composed of
vignettes of "racially ascribed" ethnic, class, and gender dif-
ferences within geriatric populations. Practitioners are told
that they may encounter variations, but knowledge of cul-
tural consistency is nevertheless emphasized, expected, and
evaluated in training assessments.
Of Florence's team members, the nurse has the most con-
tact with her. She is kind and responsive toward her needs
given her multiple health concerns. Her other therapists see
her once or twice a week with the exception of the pharma-
cist and dietitian whose communication is more sparse. The
pharmacist does not see Florence in person, and the dietitian
does an assessment once a month unless otherwise needed.
Florence's cultural preferences are addressed by providing
services that respond to her family-reported religious affilia-
tion. The chaplain, who speaks with her in Spanish, visits her
once a week unless her family requests additional visits.
Florence's concerns and progress are noted by each spe-
cialist and placed in her electronic file for her various service
providers to prescribe treatment. Despite this communica-
tion, and the group recreational activities offered by her geri-
atric services, Florence continues to exhibit depression, lack
of motivation, and isolationist behavior. All of Florence's
health care professionals describe her care as "client cen-
tered" and believe that they are being responsive to her cul-
tural, medical, and emotional needs despite her apparent
inability to thrive . . .
Florence's lack of communication is attributed to her
incipient dementia. In the meantime, the standard profes-
sional hierarchy takes place with the physician having pri-
mary voice in her assessment. Disagreements between
practitioners, due to communication difficulties and areas of
expertise, occur repeatedly and resentment between profes-
sionals is sometimes noticeable even when not stated directly.
Power differentials become evident as medical decisions are
made.
In the biomedical multidisciplinary team model depicted
in this description, it is clear that Florence's experience of
pathology and medical interventions take a primary role in
her care. Her cultural needs are peripherally addressed
through secondary sources such as family members, cultural
competence trainings, or through the cultural assumptions of
the institution.
Her sexual identity is mentioned in the case notes, but not
addressed as an area of importance to Florence. In fact, her
lack of communication is defined as a cognitive deficit rather
than explored as an effect of staff and institutional cultural
assumptions. Now, let us view her case via the lens of the
Sanctuary Model, an ethic of care, and the PIE approach.
Florence, Transformative Treatment, and Client
Engagement Through Transdisciplinary Teams
Florence's team members are the same, but the culturally rel-
evant training they receive focuses on cultural humility,
transformative complicity, and empowerment. Decreasing
the power differential between service providers and clients
Duntley-Matos et al. 9
is a primary goal for the team. The practitioners are taught to
question their biases and assumptions about their clients and
about each other, to use exploratory communication strate-
gies from a position of openness, critical self-awareness,
active and empathic listening, and from an understanding
that they know very little about all that there is to be known
about Florence, her history, and social circumstances.
From a cultural humility perspective, Florence is defined
primarily by her strengths and her abilities are prioritized to
better address her bio-psychosocial concerns. Team mem-
bers, including Florence and her family, meet weekly to
communicate and problem solve collaboratively with the
goal of moving toward a transdisciplinary model of interven-
tion where professional boundaries are intentionally crossed
to address all diagnoses more effectively. The social worker
is a crucial liaison. She regularly meets with Florence to gain
a deeper appreciation of her cultural ancestry, family history,
community support network, socio-cultural multidimension-
alities, cultural preferences, and personal strengths. Because
Florence is considered the central source of information
about herself, she is the primary reporter of her experience:
her needs, desires, and social reality. The social work team
member participates as an advocate to strengthen Florence's
problem-solving abilities and to reduce anxiety and depres-
sion related to her incipient dementia, grief, and health care
needs. She also helps her obtain needed resources by facili-
tating mutual aid community and health networks given
Florence's grandparenting responsibilities and sexual
identity.
Team members contextualize all of Florence's treatment
from multi-cultural and intersectional perspectives based on
how she understands her economic, ethnic, gender, sexual,
spiritual and political orientations, as well as her class ascrip-
tions (among other identities) in relation to each other and to
her needs at the time of each meeting. Her team members
actively struggle to transcend their own epistemic privilege
to validate her self-worth and to accept that they play a small,
but important part in her universe.
During this process, the practitioners will use transforma-
tive complicity by continuously analyzing how institutional
protocols, policies, and practices hinder or promote effective
and responsive care for Florence. They analyze structural,
behavioral, and ideological barriers by considering assump-
tions of privilege that may go unnoticed when consciously
focused critical reflection is not part of the teamwork pro-
cess. Team members continuously assess their own commu-
nication patterns to ensure empathy and a reduction of power
imbalances between them, between them and the institution,
and between them and Florence.
For instance, if Florence has a desire to remain indepen-
dent, team members who succumb to restrictive risk man-
agement processes exacerbate complicity in Florence's
failure to thrive. To promote positive transformation in her
life, calculated shared risks must be taken to reduce restric-
tive interactions, structures, and policies at the interpersonal,
organizational, and broader political levels. Concrete exam-
ples include offering fall prevention programs that increase
independence, providing dementia informed education for
Florence, her loved ones, and the wider community, facilitat-
ing access to more responsive living options, teaching com-
munication techniques to help redirect Florence when she
experiences confusion and anxiety, including her in advo-
cacy that supports payment for holistic and integrated ser-
vices, and identifying collaborative community activities for
her and her grandchild.
Shattering Ageist Stereotypes: The Importance of
Generativity and Altruism
There is a growing body of literature emphasizing the life-
enhancing effects of pro-social activities for the elderly that
improve quality of life, positive affect, and longevity (Kahana,
Bhatta, Lovegreen, 2013). Silverstein, Conroy, and Gans
(2012) emphasized moral capital as transgenerationally
transmitted altruistic values through social institutions such
as schools, churches, and social service agencies. These can
help children and family members develop norms of filial
responsibility (p. 1259). Similarly, Oswald and Masciadrelli
(2008) provide an insightful discussion of Erik Erikson's
work on generativity and ritual in extended rural LGBTQ
families. Their work stresses the empowering effect of gen-
erativity through extended/fictive kin relationship in reen-
acted or newly created rituals. These strengthen community
ties while defying the sometimes marginalizing effects of bio-
legal kinship expectations.
Studying lesbian or gay (LG) generativity may facilitate theory
development by bringing our attention to human caring that is not
expected within a normative life course. It is common for adult
lesbians and gay men to define their families by received support
and chosen obligation rather than normative roles within biolegal
kinship systems. (Oswald, 2002, p. 1061, column 1, para. 2)
This is an area where transdisciplinary teamwork can have
positive effects for someone like Florence through advo-
cacy efforts that bridge the community/social service
divide.
Generativity and altruistic activities can help the elderly
support others as they strengthen their own networks and
areas of influence. Such integrative community-based strate-
gies decrease the highly concerning effects of isolation such
as feelings of victimization, marginalization, and psycho-
logical vulnerability (Morley & Tumosa, 2012). They
increase independence by fostering personal, family, and
community dignity and worth. Even in cases of beginning
dementia, it has been found that increasing validating net-
works may reverse or reduce cognitive deterioration, espe-
cially when accompanied by consistent physical activity that
is motivating and life enhancing. According to Fiatarone
Singh and Morley (2012),
10 SAGE Open
Physical activity, is "associated with more positive psychological
attributes and a lower prevalence and incidence of depressive
symptoms (p. 110) . . . Walking significantly reduce[s] the risk
of dementia . . . Exercise also protects against the neurotoxicity
of ageing stress (p. 111) . . .
Szwabo (2012) informes us that "[I]nformation process-
ing and motivation are [positively] affected by the mood of
the individual" and promote healthy risk taking (p. 43).
Sachs-Ericsson and Blazer (2012) add that; "Social support
may serve as a buffer against disability while social disen-
gagement may be a risk factor for [increased] cognitive
impairment" (p. 1005). By emphasizing the social needs of a
patient like Florence, team members are better able to pro-
vide life-enhancing supports while tracking and preventing
institutional and service provider harms. Institutions also
profit by managing client time and resources more effec-
tively while improving the working environment.
A Community-Based Strength's Perspective:
Reframing Florence's Initial Biomedical
Representation
Florence is a warm and friendly 86-year-old woman who,
prior to her family losses, was described by her community
members as having a lively sense of humor, sharing with oth-
ers and loving her grandchild. Although she has experienced
increased marginalization after loosing her only child and
husband of 62 years, and after identifying with the LGBTQ
community, her church members, niece and nephew have
come to her support. They have identified themselves as
extended family members who are willing to be educated in
cultural humility and dementia reductive approaches.
Florence's niece and nephew value her as the family histo-
rian who, prior to her depression, actively sought to share her
long-term memories. During times of lucidity, Florence
states that she is eager to maintain as much of an active life-
style as possible and that she is enthusiastic about her ener-
getic past. She is able to ambulate on a walker, she likes the
company of others, and she is proud of being described as
having a heart of gold. Her strong values of caring for others
and her own challenges finding acceptance for her sexual
orientation facilitate her willingness to forgive and be accept-
ing of others.
It is apparent that, although living independently, Florence
has networks in her community and her extended family that
are willing to be supportive. Several are validating of her
grief and journey of self-discovery and are able to buffer
countering ideological, behavioral, and structural forces that
negatively affect her well-being and social integration. The
process of gentrification affecting her neighborhood, ironi-
cally, has spurred community organization activities that can
benefit from Florence's keen historical knowledge of the
area. It is in this context that Florence meets younger mem-
bers who identify as LGBTQ for mutual support.
Her interdisciplinary team, trained in active listening
skills, an ethic of care, and critical self-reflection at the indi-
vidual and institutional levels, consistently practices power
reduction strategies with its members, Florence, and the
institution. The difficult challenges of promoting a demo-
cratic and community-centered agency environment are
embraced in a structured and consistent manner. This effort
enables team members to improve their understanding of
how best to respond to Florence's multidimensional needs
while helping her understand the benefits of her existing and
burgeoning support networks.
Florence's health challenges, physical limitations, and
mood difficulties are prioritized, but reframed by including
her in altruistic and generative community engagement that
is protective of her energy and physical and cognitive abili-
ties. Her dignity and worth are emphasized even when these
seem to counter the cultural preconceptions enforced by the
institution charged with her care. Thus, the geriatric center
and team provide her with the dignity of risk to counter pro-
tocols that augment her alienation and depression, but which
due to being the norm, often go unperceived.
To address her cultural and sexual identity preferences,
after consulting with her, her team makes an effort to include
decor of Latinx LGBTQ families among those of other
groups. Through humor and the inclusion of topics that are
pleasing to Florence, the team encourages her to expand her
social relationships and to offer her talents and services to
her community. Her communication needs are monitored
more carefully and addressed more effectively. The team
members are careful to respond to her use of English and
more limited use of Spanish from context to context rather
than assuming that they must speak to her in formal Spanish.
In essence, Florence and her transdisciplinary team have
been able to co-develop strategies that address her cognitive,
physical, emotional, and social health in ways that enable her
to contribute to herself, to her family, to the greater good of
the agency, and to her community.
Conclusion
Geriatric patients will soon make up the majority of the U.S.
population and are in dire need of policies, institutional, and
integrated team-based health care services that focus on their
needs from a cultural humility, transformative complicity,
and empowerment perspective. In geriatric care, the strength-
ening of socio-cultural networks through altruistic and gen-
erative activities is offered as a necessary means to address
elderly clients, family systems, and community-relevant
needs. From a political empowerment perspective, we advo-
cate for the deconstruction of moral entrepreneurship
(Cousins, 2009) and the reduction of marginalizing social
values that stigmatize vulnerable populations for the purpose
of political and economic gain. Policies that promote ageism
(Morley & Tumosa, 2012), enforce normative cultural mores
to the exclusion of diversity, and which permeate our health
Duntley-Matos et al. 11
care system, are examples of areas that need rapid redress
through transdisciplinary team advocacy. The Los Angeles
Gay and Lesbian Center's Senior Services, the MSVD, and
STAR-VA models have shown that this approach is not only
more therapeutic for the patient but also more cost- and goal-
effective for the institution.
Transforming deficit-based representations of our ageing
populations to portrayals of wisdom, productivity, strength,
and mutual nurturance can help decrease national patterns of
social marginalization (Kahana et al., 2013). The potential
and actual contributions of our elderly are many.
One positive example is the Hope Clinic in Ypsilanti,
Michigan, which uses volunteer services carried out by car-
ing retired physicians who provide free medical treatment to
low-income and indigent community members. This is an
example of how practice contradicts political mystification.
Definitions of human disposability are socially constructed,
disseminated, and embraced to fulfill the needs of, often-
times, unscrupulous market priorities. However, volunteer
clinics and related social services demonstrate how altruism
and social connectivity are promoters of continued physical
activity and community inclusion that are often ignored. Not
only do altruistic and culturally relevant generative activi-
ties improve the health of the general population, but they
also enhance the overall quality of life of our culturally var-
ied geriatric patients (Fiatarone et al., 2012; Morley &
Tumosa, 2012).
Thus, the call for inter/transdisciplinary teamwork in
health care is crucial from a transformative complicity per-
spective that hopes to reduce our participation in the margin-
alization of our aging populations. As stated by Cousins's
(2009) in "It Ain't as Simple as it Seems . . ."
[O]ppressions and inequalities are [often] stealthily built into
our therapies, interventions, programs, and procedures--
activities we feel certain are necessary and fair representations
of our good will, humanity, and sense of social justice . . . people
labeled as "risky" [however] too often bear the burden of this
reproduction of inequality . . . Legislative acts and policies
founded on simplistic, stigmatizing, or inaccurate assumptions
shape the social services that flow from them (p. 96) . . . [As
social workers and health service providers] we must identify,
challenge, question, and otherwise expose the incomplete,
narrow, and harmful logic and reasoning that mystify too many
of us into lockstep formations on behalf of a common moral
definition of, and answer to, social problems. (p. 106)
Carefully considering the needs of our growing Latinx
elderly populations, their rich national and ethnic diversity
and, within that, their complex multidimensional embodi-
ment of sexual orientation, class, gender, abilities, and other
identities, will not only help us promote longevity, but greater
health and spiritual fulfillment for those who came before us
and continue to offer us the wisdom of their histories, experi-
ences, and cultural insight.
