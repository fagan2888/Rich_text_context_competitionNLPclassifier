Objective: This paper describes the development and ef®cacy of a diet quality index (DQI) for China.
Design: The Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents motivated the selection of 10 DQI components. These
components were weighted and assigned cut-offs and point schemes based on the Chinese Food Guide Pagoda,
Chinese andaor international dietary reference values. The ef®cacy of resulting DQI scores was assessed relative
to a priori expectations.
Subjects: The Chinese DQI was evaluated using cross-sectional 3 day diet record and anthropometric data on
7450 adults from the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey.
Methods: For each individual, a DQI total score was calculated as the sum of components, and DQI pattern
scores calculated to re¯ect the underlying composition of diet quality problems. The DQI scores were compared
with component scores, food and nutrient intake, weight status and sociodemographic variables.
Results: The total DQI score simultaneously represented all component aspects of diet quality as well as
micronutrients not explicitly built into the index. The total DQI score was signi®cantly correlated with food and
nutrient intakes, BMI, urban residence and income. The DQI pattern scores correlated with DQI components and
weight status as expected.
Conclusions: The China DQI captures variation along several components of diet quality, appears sensitive to
under- and overnutrition, as well as sociodemographic variables. The China DQI may prove useful for
monitoring the nutrition transition and epidemiologic trends in China.

Introduction
Related to nutrition transitions worldwide, there is a shift in
concern from nutrient de®ciency towards dietary excess,
chronic disease morbidity and overall diet quality. This
shift forces researchers to abandon single-factor paradigms
of disease etiology in favor of paradigms involving multi-
ple and interrelated risk factors. Nutrition researchers
worldwide are increasingly faced with understanding and
teasing apart the effects of several causative agents and
multicollinear nutrients. Strong correlations between
energy and macronutrients and between micronutrients
make conceptualizing and estimating independent effects
of speci®c nutrients dif®cult. To keep pace with nutrition
transitions and adjust policy appropriately, developing as
well as developed countries need measures of overall diet
quality that capture diets as a whole and avoid problems
associated with food- or nutrient-speci®c measures (WHO,
1996).
In developing countries, including China, nutrition and
epidemiologic transitions have begun and are proceeding at
extremely accelerated rates (Drewnowski & Popkin, 1997;
Mondini & Monteiro, 1997; Monteiro et al, 1995; Popkin
et al, 1993,1995; Popkin, 1994,1998). Changes which took
50 y to occur in the US have been compressed into periods
as short as 7 y in China. In addition to overall declines in
food scarcity and increases in the prevalence of overweight,
the speed and unequal distribution of economic and demo-
graphic change typically create pockets of undernutrition
among at-risk groups (Popkin et al, 1993,1995; Chen & Xu,
1996). Due to the coexisting pockets of under- and over-
nutrition, developing countries require measures of diet
quality that are sensitive to both under- and overnutrition.
Indeed, the Chinese Nutrition Society highlight this two-
dimensional need in their Dietary Guidelines for Chinese
Residents (SBCNS, 1999).
The ®rst objective of this paper was to describe the
development of diet quality index (DQI) measures for
China, and illustrate methods for DQI development that
accommodate coexisting problems of under- and overnutri-
tion. The proposed DQI measures are intended to examine
current diet quality in China and guiding the Chinese diet
towards better overall nutrition. The goal was to create a
¯exible measure for research and policy-making purposes
that re¯ects both under- and overnutrition, identi®es groups
with poor diet quality, and differentiates between different
types of poor diet quality. The key ingredients for this
process, namely national dietary guidelines, dietary intake
references, and detailed multilevel dietary data are
available for China.
Development of the DQI for China began with concepts
from existing DQI for the US (Haines et al, 1999; Patterson
et al, 1994), and went further to incorporate the

two-dimensional (de®ciency and overconsumption) con-
cerns of the Chinese Nutrition Society. The following
paragraphs present the DQI components, structure and
rationale for a total DQI score, and introduce a strategy
for evaluating DQI patterns in China. DQI components
were selected, and a scaling system generated based on
world reference values, the Chinese Recommended Daily
Allowances (RDA, see Table 6; INFH-CAPM, 1991) and
Food Guide Pagoda (see Figure 1; SBCNS, 1999). The DQI
components were summed to create a total DQI score that
positions diets along a spectrum of under- to overnutrition.
The components were also combined into DQI patterns that
provide qualitative information on the relative combination
of under- and overnutrition problems.
The second objective of this work was to assess the
ef®cacy of the Chinese DQI total score and DQI patterns
based on a priori expectations of how the DQI should
perform. We applied the DQI to data from the China Health
and Nutrition Surveys and tested for expected correlations
between the DQI scores, food and nutrient intakes, as well
as sociodemographic and anthropometric variables. We
expected the DQI scores to correlate with food and nutrient
intakes. Given previous research, we also expected the
Chinese DQI to correlate with urbanarural residence,
income and weight status (Popkin et al, 1993,1995).
Methods
The Standing Board of the Chinese Nutrition Society
proposed qualitative Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Resi-
dents that re¯ect the multi-dimensionality of diet as well as
the nutrition and epidemiologic transitions in China (see
Table 1) (SBCNS, 1999). The proposed guidelines expli-
citly aim to reduce both extremes of poverty and excess,
promote good health, enhance immunity, reduce the risks
of stunting and rickets, and prevent cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, osteoporosis and some cancers.
Choice of components for the Chinese Diet Quality Index
To develop a DQI for China we followed the same general
strategy used to develop the UNC-CH DQI and revised
version of this DQI (Haines et al, 1999; Patterson et al,
1994). DQI components were selected to represent aspects
of diet quality highlighted by the Dietary Guidelines for
Chinese Residents. The 10 components re¯ect the food
group-, food-, macronutrient- andaor micronutrient-level
evidence that motivated the Dietary Guidelines (SBCNS,
1999). With the exception of the last guideline, `Avoid
unsanitary and spoiled foods', all elements of the Dietary
Guidelines were incorporated into the Chinese DQI.
Table 1 describes how each DQI component corre-
sponds with one or more of the Dietary Guidelines for
Chinese Residents. The diet variety and total carbohydrate
components were chosen to evaluate compliance with the
dietary guideline `Eat a variety of foods, with cereals as the
staple'. Since grains and cereals are the main sources of
carbohydrate in the Chinese diet, percentage of energy
from carbohydrate was considered a reasonable indicator
of staple food consumption. The fruit and vegetable
component was selected to match the second guideline
`Consume plenty of vegetables, fruits and tubers'. The
protein component corresponded with the third and fourth
dietary guidelines. Considering that the third guideline,
regarding the consumption of bean products and animal
foods, was motivated by low nationwide calcium intakes
and increasing rates of osteoporosis (SBCNS, 1999; Ge &
Cheng, 1999), a separate calcium component was included
in the DQI. In addition to the protein component, total fat
and saturated fat components were included in the DQI to
address the fourth dietary guideline, `Consume appropriate
amounts of ®sh, poultry, eggs and lean meat; reduce fatty

meat and animal fat in the diet'. The total fat and saturated
fat components index over consumption of fatty meat and
animal fat. The sodium and alcoholic beverage components
re¯ect the sixth and seventh dietary guidelines,
respectively.
Relative weights and score values for the DQI components
The DQI components and scoring scheme are described in
Table 2. To re¯ect the relative importance of foods over
nutrients as dietary components, greater weight was given
to food-level components in the China DQI. The diet
variety and fruit and vegetable components, both food-
level components, were each allowed 12 points. The
nutrient-level components were weighted equally such
that each component was worth a maximum of 10 points.
Due to minimal alcoholism in China, the alcohol compo-
nent was assigned a maximum of only 6 points. Score
values were chosen so that a diet that met all of the Dietary
Guidelines for Chinese Residents received a total DQI
score of zero points. Components indexing aspects of
undernutrition only received negative scores. Components
indexing aspects of overnutrition only received positive
scores. Components indexing aspects of under- or over-
nutrition received either positive or negative scores. Since
the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents emphasize
more undernutrition-related than overnutrition-related pro-
blems, we proposed more DQI components with negative
scores than positive scores. Continuous point scales were
employed for the diet variety and fruit and vegetable
components, where obvious cut-offs were not readily
available. Cut-offs were chosen and categorical point
schemes were used for the remaining components.
Rationale for component cut-offs and scoring
Diet variety. To ensure a balanced diet that satis®es all
nutrient requirements, the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese
Residents recommend consumption of a variety of foods
from several categories, including cereals and tubers,
animal foods, beans and bean products, as well as vege-
tables and fruit. These four main food categories were used
to create the diet variety component of the DQI. Food sub-
categories were used as the level of analysis, instead of
individual foods, since broader food aggregates are more
likely to capture true dietary variability. There was surpris-
ingly little variance in the number of major food groups
consumed. Several food sub-categories, which may differ
somewhat in nutrient composition (corn and coarse grains,
organ meats and meat products, ®sh and shell®sh), were
combined to increase the variance of the diversity score.
Scaling for this component followed the approach used
for the diet diversity component of the revised UNC-CH
DQI (Haines et al, 1999). As in the UNC-CH DQI, within
each of the four main categories (see Table 3), points were
awarded for consumption of greater than 25 g of foods
belonging to nutritionally distinct sub-categories. The 25 g
cut-off was arbitrarily chosen by Haines et al (1999) for the
UNC-CH DQI to ensure that quantities in each subcategory
were large enough to be nutritionally meaningful. For each
main food category, points were calculated as the percen-
tage of the maximum possible score. For example, assume
a main food category contains four distinct sub-categories.
If more than 25 g of foods belonging to only two (of the
possible four) sub-categories were consumed, the score for
that main category would be calculated as 2a4. Due to the
wider variety of fruit and vegetables compared with other
food categories, points for each main category were
weighted such that the fruit and vegetable category
accounted for 40% of the total diversity score (maximum
worth 12 points). The remaining three main categories each
contributed 20% to the total. Weighted points from each of
the four main food categories were next summed to
calculate the total diet variety score. Since low food
diversity is an inadequate aspect of dietary intake, the
total diversity score was assigned a negative scale, such
that the diversity score ranged from À12 to zero.
Fruit and vegetables. The fruit and vegetable component of
the DQI evaluated both total consumption of fruit and
vegetables as well as speci®c consumption of carotene-
rich vegetables (carotene content exceeds 90 Rea100 g).
The aggregate food group was chosen to match the Dietary
Guidelines, which explicitly combine vegetable and fruit
consumption, as well as indexing bene®cial components of
these foods, such as ®ber. Special attention was given to
carotene-rich vegetables, since greater carotene intakes are
recommended to reduce vitamin A de®ciency, improve
overall health and possibly protect against cancer and
atherogenesis (Mahan & Escott-Stump, 1996; Thomas,
1991; NRC, 1989).
Total fruit and vegetable intake was evaluated based on
the Food Guide Pagoda recommendation to consume 500 ±
700 g of fruit and vegetables daily (SBCNS, 1999). As
quantitative recommendations for consumption of caro-
tene-rich vegetables were unavailable for China, we

adapted the procedure used in the development of the US
National Food Guide (Welsh, 1994) to estimate an optimal
intake of this food group. Brie¯y, using dietary data for
adults aged 20 ± 59 from the China Health and Nutrition
Surveys (described below), we calculated the 3-day average
amount of carotene-rich vegetables (g) consumed per meal
per consumer (raw Ð before cooking). The resulting
amount (134 g) was rounded to an easy to use number
(150 g). Next, we estimated the carotene content of this
group by calculating the weighted average content of the 20
most frequently consumed carotene-rich vegetables
(242 Rea100 g). Our calculations indicated that consump-
tion of approximately twice the average amount per meal
(300 g) of carotene-rich vegetables could meet 90% of the
Chinese RDA for retinol equivalents (800 Re). Given that
twice the average amount consumed at a single meal is (1)
a logistically reasonable amount to consume in one day,
and (2) it allows moderate to high carotene intakes as
de®ned by the RDA, we set optimal intake of carotene-rich
vegetables at 300 g.
In order to identify fruit and vegetable-dense diets (as
opposed to high absolute intakes), separate standards were
developed for higher and lower energy intake categories.
The energy intake cut-off of 2600 kcal represents the
Chinese RDA for male adults assuming light physical
activity and approximates the energy RDA for females
assuming moderate activity (2700 kcal). For individuals
with energy intakes above 2600 kcal, optimal intake was
de®ned as 700 g of total fruit and vegetable consumption
including 300 g (or 40% of the total) of carotene-rich
vegetables. For individuals with energy intakes below this
threshold, optimal intake was de®ned as 500 g of total fruit
and vegetable intake, including 200 g (40% of the total).
Scores for the fruit and vegetable component of the DQI
were calculated as follows and capped at 12 points:
Higher energy intake: fruit and vegetable score
 6[(TVFa700)  (CVa300)]
Lower energy intake: fruit and vegetable score
 6[(TVFa500)  (CVa200)]
where TVF is total vegetables and fruit (g) and CV is
carotene-rich vegetables (g).
Since low fruit and vegetable intake is an inadequate
aspect of dietary intake and poor diet quality, this score was
assigned a negative scale, ranging from À12 to zero.
Total energy. Cut-offs for the energy intake component of
the DQI were chosen to distinguish between differences in
energy intake that may result in weight loss or gain over
time. Optimal energy intake was determined to be within a
range around the age-, sex- and physical activity-speci®c
RDA (see Table 4). The ability of the DQI to meaningfully
rank individuals in the CHNS sample also in¯uenced our
decisions for these cut-offs. A score of zero was awarded
for 3-day mean energy intakes within 80 ± 120% of the age-,
sex- and physical activity-speci®c RDA. Mean energy
intakes between 70% and 80%, below 70% of the RDA,
were considered low and given negative scores of À5 and
À10 points, respectively. Mean intakes between 120%
and 130%, and above 130%, in contrast, were considered
high, and given positive scores of 5 and 10 points,
respectively.
Total carbohydrate. The American and Canadian Dietary
Guidelines recommend that the percentage of energy from
carbohydrate should exceed 55% of energy or 138 ga1000
kcal (Thomas, 1991; Wardlaw & Gordon, 1993). Due to
circumstances in China, where subsets of the population (eg
poor and rural groups) are at risk from over-consumption of
carbohydrate and underconsumption of protein and fat,
both minimum and maximum targets for carbohydrate
consumption were deemed necessary. For this DQI com-
ponent, the cut-off for minimum optimal intake was set at
55% of energy. A cut-off for maximum optimal intake was
arbitrarily set at 69% of energy. Total carbohydrate intakes
between 55 and 69% of energy received zero points. Lower
intakes between 50 and 55% and less than 50% received
positive points, 5 and 10, respectively. Higher intakes
between 70 and 75% and over 75% received negative
points, À5 andÀ10 points, respectively.
Total Fat. According to the China National Nutrition
Survey, the mean total fat intake is 22% of energy (Ge
et al, 1996). In keeping with the WHOaFAO recommenda-
tions (WHO, 1990; WHOaFAO, 1995), the Chinese Nutri-
tion Society recommends a minimum total fat intake of
15% of energy (personal communication). Although many
Western countries and the World Health Organization
recommend that total fat intake should not exceed 30%
of daily total energy intake (Thomas 1991; Wardlaw &
Gordon, 1993), evidence suggests that greater health ben-
e®ts may be achieved with further reductions (Thomas,
1991).
Since the level of fat consumption in China is low relative
to other countries, a lower maximum recommended intake
may not only be bene®cial, but practical. In 1989, The
Chinese Nutrition Society proposed that optimal total fat
intake should range from 20 to 25% energy (CNS, 1990).
Greater than 15%, but less than 25% of energy from fat was
chosentorepresentoptimaltotalfatintakeforthe DQI.Three-
daymeantotal fatintakeswithinthisrange were awardedzero
points. Mean total fat intakes between 25 and 30% of energy
received a score of 5, while intakes over 30% received a score
of 10. Mean fat intakes between 10 ± 14% and under 10%
were scored À5 and À10, respectively.
Saturated fat. Suf®cient evidence suggests that greater
bene®ts might be achieved if saturated fat intake is reduced
to 7 or 8% of energy intake, less than the 10% of energy
currently recommended in North America (Thomas 1991;
Wardlaw & Gordon, 1993; NRC, 1989). Following this
rationale, saturated fat intakes of less than 7% of energy
received the maximum score of zero points for this DQI
component. The upper limit of intake was considered to be
10% of energy intake. Saturated fat intakes above this level
received 10 points.
Protein. Cut-offs for the protein component of the DQI
were based on the proportion of energy derived from
protein intake. Optimal protein intake was considered the
amount relative to energy intake required to avoid protein
energy malnutrition. Optimal protein intake was arbitrarily
de®ned as above 10% of energy from protein. Protein
intakes between 8 and 10% of energy receivedÀ5 points.
Negative points (À10) were awarded for mean protein
intakes less than 8% of energy.
Calcium. Considering both the greater within-person varia-
tion for calcium vs macronutrient intakes and the low
Measuring diet quality in China

calcium intakes in the population, a cut-off of 67% was
arbitrarily chosen for optimal intake. Calcium intakes over
67% of the Chinese RDA (800 mg; see Table 4, INFH-
CAPM, 1991) were assigned zero points. Calcium intakes
between 50% and 66% of the RDA received À5 points.
Intakes below 50% of the RDA were assigned À10 points.
Sodium. Sodium intake cut-offs for the DQI re¯ect the
Chinese Nutrition Society recommendation to reduce salt
intake to a maximum of 10 g per day (CNS, 1990). An
upper limit for sodium intake of 4000 mg was calculated to
re¯ect consumption of 10 g of salt. Sodium intakes above
this level were scored 10 points. Optimal intake was
de®ned according to the World Health Organization recom-
mendation of 6 g of salt, equivalent to 2400 mg of sodium
(Thomas 1991; Wardlaw & Gordon, 1993). Intakes below
this cut-off received the optimal zero points. Sodium
intakes falling between 2400 and 4000 mg received 5
points.
Alcoholic beverages. The Standing Board of the Chinese
Nutrition Society recommends a maximum limit of 50 g (1
liang) of 38% alcohol for both men and women (personal
communication, unpublished proceedings, June 1998). This
amount is equivalent to approximately 19 ml of pure
alcohol, 160 ml of 12% wine, and 475 ml of beer. To
assign points for the alcohol component of the DQI,
reported alcohol intakes (g) were ®rst expressed as a
percentage of the beverage-speci®c standard. Consumption
of alcohol above 100% of the recommended maximum
amount received 6 points. Consumption of less than half of
the recommended maximum amount received zero points.
Lastly, individuals consuming between 50 and 100% of the
recommended amount received 3 points.
Calculating the Chinese DQI total score and pattern score
As described above, the DQI components were scored to
re¯ect aspects of undernutrition and overnutrition, respec-
tively. The undernutrition-related components have nega-
tive scores; conversely, those re¯ecting aspects of
overnutrition have positive scores. This paper proposes
two ways to combine the component scores, each offering
different information.
The ®rst way of looking at average total diet quality is to
create a DQI total score by summing the component scores.
Analogous to the USDA HEI and UNC-CH DQI, the DQI
total score provides information on the position of the diet,
how the diet looks, on average, tending more towards
under- or overnutrition. A negative total DQI score repre-
sents a diet that is overall undernourishing, while a positive
score represents a diet which overall appears overnourish-
ing. A zero score meets all component criteria for diet
quality.
Given the emphasis of the Dietary Guidelines for Chi-
nese Residents on aspects of undernutrition, there are more
negative-scoring components than positive-scoring compo-
nents. More negative-scoring components together with
equally weighted nutrient-level components (above ideal
fat intake scores  5 points, below ideal fat intake scores
À5 points) mean that the resulting DQI total score is a
continuous variable that ranges from À74 to 56 points.
More explicitly, the total DQI score does not have a range
from À50 to  50, because to create such a range we
would have had to contradict the Guidelines for Chinese
Residents by weighting overnutrition-related components
more than undernutrition-related components.
The second way of evaluating the DQI components is to
look at the range of problems affecting the diets. A DQI
score of zero could re¯ect a diet that meets all component
criteria for diet quality, or a diet with under- and over-
nutrition problems that appear to cancel each other out. We
have combined the DQI component scores into two con-
tinuous variables: a lower bound score (the sum of the
negative scores) and a diet-quality distance (sum of the
absolute values of each DQI component) to get at this issue.
The DQI distance re¯ects the types or combination of diet-
quality problems in a particular diet. While a DQI distance
equal to zero would indicate no under- or overnutrition
dietary problems, a non-zero DQI distance would indicate
some combination of dietary problems. The DQI lower
bound positions the DQI distance along the spectrum from
under to overnutrition. Together the DQI lower bound and
DQI distance re¯ect the distribution of under- and over-
nutrition problems in a particular diet. The DQI lower
bound and distance can be used as continuous variables
in analyses or converted into pattern types according to cut-
offs speci®ed by the researcher. Below we present exam-
ples of why and how the DQI total score, continuous and
categorical pattern variables might be used in analyses.

scores against a priori expectations of how the DQI should
perform. If researchers are interested in positioning a diet
along the spectrum of undernutrition to overnutrition, they
might want to use the DQI total score. The DQI total score
was intended and expected to re¯ect the shift from under-
to overnutrition by correlating negatively with total carbo-
hydrate intake (as a percentage of energy), and positively
with other food and nutrient intakes. The DQI total score
was expected to be signi®cantly higher for urban residents
and higher income groups, since urbanization and devel-
opment are primary engines of the nutrition transition
towards overnutrition in China (Popkin et al, 1993,1995).
Finally, a direct association was expected between total
DQI score and body mass index (BMI), since underweight
status would be more likely among those who are under-
nourished and overweight status more likely among those
who are overnourished.

An example question that researchers might want to
address with the continuous DQI lower bound and distance
variables involves the overall number of diet-quality pro-
blems. How do diets with only undernutrition-related
problems differ from diets with both under- and over-
nutrition problems? Holding the DQI lower bound constant,
as the DQI distance (absolute number of component pro-
blems) increases, we would expect positive DQI compo-
nent scores, food and nutrient intakes, and the risk of
overweight status to increase.
To provide an example of the utility of categorical DQI
patterns, suppose researchers wish to compare subjects
whose diets meet all component criteria for diet quality
with subjects whose DQI component scores cancel each
other out (making them only appear to have zero total DQI
scores). The subjects whose component scores cancel out,
by de®nition, experience both undernutrition- and over-
nutrition-related problems. Thus, these subjects would be
expected to score higher on overnutrition-related compo-
nents (eg total fat intake), lower on undernutrition-related
components (eg protein or calcium intake), and to be more
likely to be overweight andaor underweight than subjects
with `truly' optimal diet quality. Sociodemographic
correlates of each DQI pattern could also be explored.
Sample. Data on adults aged 20 ± 59 y of age (n  7450)
from the 1991 panel of the China Health and Nutrition
Survey were used for this analysis. The China Health and
Nutrition Surveys cover eight provinces that vary substan-
tially in geography, economic development, public
resources and health indicators (Guangxi, Guizhou,
Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong).
The sampling procedures and data used in this survey are
described elsewhere in detail (eg Popkin et al, 1993;
Paeratakul et al, 1998).
Detailed household- and individual-level food consump-
tion data were collected for three consecutive days, ran-
domly allocated from Monday to Sunday. Household food
consumption was determined on a daily basis by calculat-
ing changes in food inventory. Chinese scales with a
minimum and maximum limit of 20 g and 15 kg, respec-
tively, were used. All foods in stock at the initiation of the
survey (including edible oils, sugar and salt), foods pur-
chased andaor produced at home during the survey period,
and food preparation waste (including spoiled rice or food
fed to animals) were weighed and considered in the
calculation of household food consumption.
Individual-level dietary intake data for all household
members for each of the three survey days were obtained
via a 24 h diet recall interview. Composite dishes were
recorded in terms of their raw ingredients. Individual
consumption of fat and seasonings, added during cooking,
was estimated from the household-level oil and condiment
data. The 1991 Food Composition Table for China (INFH-
CAPM, 1991) was used to calculate mean energy and
nutrient intakes.
Analysis. Food group, energy and nutrient data were used to
calculate a score for each DQI component for each indivi-
dual. The sample distribution across each component was
examined.
To determine if the DQI total score met the aim to
position diets with respect to diet quality de®ned along a
spectrum from under- to overnutrition, the DQI total score
was compared with food and nutrient intakes. Pearson
correlation coef®cients were calculated to evaluate the
correlation between the total DQI score and food group,
energy or nutrient intakes. To determine if the DQI total
score re¯ected expected relationships between diet and
sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, we ®t an
OLS regression model with total score as the outcome and
urban residence and income as the independent variables,
as well as logistic regression models with total DQI score
predicting risk of underweight or overweight status. A
pearson correlation coef®cient was also calculated between
DQI total score and BMI.
With respect to the continuous DQI lower bound and
DQI distance variables, we used OLS and logistic regres-
sion models to test the hypothesis that positive DQI
component scores, food and nutrient intakes, and weight
status would increase with increasing DQI distance, con-
trolling for DQI lower bound. No other covariates were
included in the OLS and logistic regression models.
As an example of how researchers might categorize DQI
patterns to identify and characterize different types of poor
diet quality, we classi®ed individuals into six diet quality
patterns (A, B, C, D, E, F), arbitrarily de®ned based on: a
DQI distance above or below 30, and the proportion of the
DQI distance in the positive range ` 40, 40 ± 60, or b 60%
(see Figure 2). We chose the ®rst cut-off, considering that
subjects with DQI distances of less than 30 would have
optimal scores (zero) for 5 ± 7 out of the 10 DQI compo-
nents. The second set of cut-offs was used to classify diets
Figure 2 DQI patterns (A ± F) differ with respect to their underlying
combination of under- and overnutrition problems, position along the
spectrum from under- to overnutrition, and overall number of diet-quality
problems. Mean DQI lower bound (the sum of the negative DQI compo-
nent scores) and DQI distance (sum of the absolute values of each DQI
component score) were calculated for each of the six DQI Patterns (A ± F)
for the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey sample (n  7450 adults).
Patterns A ± F were arbitrarily de®ned based on: a DQI distance above
or below 30, and the proportion of the DQI distance in the positive
range ` 40, 40 ± 60, or b 60%. Patterns A ± F were ordered to re¯ect the
shift from predominantly undernutrition- to predominantly overnutrition-
related problems. Pattern A describes diets with DQI distances greater than
30 points (eg subjects who scored À10 or 10 on more than three out of 10
components, or 5 or À5 on six out of 10 components) with the majority of
diet quality problems on the undernutrition side (46% of the sample).
Pattern B describes diets with a majority of undernutrition problems, but
fewer overall problems (less than the 30 point distance cut-off) (6% of the
sample). Pattern C describes diets which have many problems which are
equally distributed in under- and overnutrition (24% of the sample).
Pattern D represents the situation with few diet-quality problems, equally
distributed between under- and overnutrition (4% of the sample). Patterns
E and F, together accounting for 19% of the sample, represent fewer vs
many overnutrition-related problems, respectively.

according to how much of the DQI distance range falls to
one side of zero. We decided that a diet with more or less
equal proportions of undernutrition and overnutrition pro-
blems should have no less than 40% and no more than 60%
of the DQI distance on one side of zero. These pattern cut-
offs were intended for illustrative purposes only. Research-
ers are encouraged to de®ne diet patterns according to their
hypotheses of interest.
To test our example hypothesis concerning diets approx-
imating the diet-quality ideal vs diets with diet-quality
problems that appear to cancel each other out, we used
t-tests to compare the mean DQI component scores of
patterns D and C. Logistic regression models with over-
weight status, underweight status, or urbanarural residence
as the outcome, pattern C as exposure of interest, and
pattern D as reference group were also ®t to test for
expected differences by diet pattern. No covariates were
included in the logistic regression models.
Results
Components of the diet-quality index
Table 3 shows the proportion of the sample who consumed
foods belonging to major food groups included in the diet
variety component. While over 70% of the sample con-
sumed rice, wheat, or their products during the 3 day survey
period, relatively few subjects (20%) consumed corn,
coarse grains or starchy roots. Red meat was the most
consumed animal food in this sample. Approximately 65%
of the sample consumed red meat or a red meat product
during the survey period. Consumption of other animal
foods was much lower. Roughly a third of the sample
consumed some ®sh during the 3 day survey. Just over half
of the sample consumed legumes or legume products. Only
a tiny minority (3% of the sample) consumed milk or dairy
products. Although close to 100% of the sample consumed
light-colored vegetables with lower carotene content, only
55% and 15% of the sample consumed carotene-rich dark-
colored vegetables and fruit, respectively.
The sample distribution across categories of each DQI
component and the mean scores for each DQI component
are presented in Table 2. Over 50% of the sample had
optimal intakes for the alcohol, protein, energy and satu-
rated fat components. At the other extreme, a majority of
the sample received the worst possible scores (À10 or 10)
for the calcium and sodium components. Diet variety and
fruit and vegetable intake were less than optimal for over
80% of the sample. As might be expected, the mean
component scores for the components indexing both
under- and overnutrition appeared close to zero Ð or indi-
cative of good diet quality. These mean scores concealed
the fact that only 30 ± 40% of the sample had optimal
carbohydrate and total fat intake. For the energy, carbohy-
drate and total fat components, 10 ± 15% of the sample had
very low intakes, while 10 ± 30% had very high intakes.
Overall, it appears that the greatest current problems for the
present sample are high sodium, low calcium, variety, and
fruit and vegetable intake. Moderate problems include
modest underconsumption of protein, and both under- and
overconsumption of total fat and carbohydrate.
The DQI total score correlates with food and nutrient
intakes
The mean (s.d.) value for the DQI total score was À8.7
(19.8). Variation in the total DQI score appeared related to
variation in each of the component aspects of diet quality.
Table 5 presents the mean intakes of fruit and vegetables,
energy and nutrients by total score groups. As expected, the
total DQI score appeared positively and signi®cantly cor-
related with fruit and vegetable, carotene-rich vegetable,
energy, protein, calcium, sodium and alcohol intakes. Mean
fruit and vegetable and calcium intakes more than doubled
between the bottom and top DQI total score groups.
Energy, total fat and protein intakes increased by 50%, 5-
fold and 15%, respectively, from the bottom to top total
score groups. Carbohydrate intake decreased signi®cantly
with DQI total score. The DQI total score was also
positively and signi®cantly related to nutrients not expli-
citly covered by the DQI, namely retinol, vitamin C, iron,
niacin, ribo¯avin, zinc, mono- and polyunsaturated fat
intakes (data not shown, but P-values all ` 0.001). The
results indicate that with this DQI structure, the more food
consumed, the higher the total DQI score (the further from
undernutrition, the closer towards overnutrition).
The DQI total score covaries with urban residence and
income
Major determinants of dietary change in China are urbani-
zation and development. If urbanization and development
are linked with the nutrition transition, we might expect
urban areas and higher income groups to have higher DQI
total scores than rural areas and lower income groups. This

is indeed what we observed. The crude mean (s.d.) DQI
total scores in urban and rural areas were 0.0 (18.5) and
À12.9 (19.0), respectively. The crude mean (s.d.) DQI total
scores in higher and lower income groups (above and
below the median income) were À1.2 (18.4) and À15.3
(18.7), respectively. In an OLS regression model, urban
residence and income were signi®cantly (P ` 0.0001) and
positively associated with DQI total score.
The DQI total score correlates with weight status
As a diet moves from one extreme along the spectrum to
the other, we might also expect the risk of underweight to
decrease, and the risk of overweight to increase. In keeping
with this expectation, the mean DQI total scores for under-
weight, normal weight and overweight subjects, respec-
tively were: À10.1 (20.0), À8.7 (19,7) and À5.1 (20.0).
In logistic regression models the risk of underweight
decreased signi®cantly (OR  0.995, 99% CI: 0.991 ±
0.999, P-value  0.02) and the risk of overweight increased
signi®cantly (OR  1.008, 99% CI: 1.005 ± 1.013,
P ` 0.0001) with each unit increase in DQI total score. A
signi®cant pearson correlation coef®cient was observed
between the continuous BMI and DQI total score variables
(r  0.05, P ` 0.0001).
DQI lower bound and DQI distance
We combined the DQI component scores into two contin-
uous variables: a lower bound score (the sum of the
negative scores) and a diet-quality distance (sum of the
absolute values of each DQI component). Together the DQI
lower bound and DQI distance describe the distribution or
combination of under- and overnutrition problems in a
particular diet. As expected, signi®cant linear associations
were consistently observed in OLS models with the con-
tinuous DQI lower bound and DQI distance variables as
independent predictors of food and nutrient intakes (see
Table 6).
For each unit increase in DQI lower bound, fruit and
vegetable, energy, total fat, saturated fat, MUFA and
PUFA, sodium and calcium intakes increased signi®cantly,
while carbohydrate and intake decreased signi®cantly,
independent of the DQI distance. As expected, the DQI
distance re¯ected the overall extent of both under- and
overnutrition-related diet-quality problems. Increases in the
DQI distance were signi®cantly associated with increasing
energy, total fat, saturated fat, MUFA and PUFA, and
sodium, and decreasing fruit and vegetable intake, carbo-
hydrate, calcium, ®ber and vitamin C. For any given level
of undernutrition-related poor diet quality (the lower
bound), the greater the overall number of diet quality
problems (the DQI distance) for a particular diet, the
more overnutrition-related problems.
In OLS models, urban residence was signi®cantly and
positively associated with the continuous DQI lower bound
(b  5.5; s.e. (b)  0.3, P ` 0.0001) and distance (b  1.8,
s.e. (b)  0.3, P ` 0.0001) variables. Although urban resi-
dents tended to have fewer undernutrition-related problems,
for a given level of undernutrition, they had more over-
nutrition-related problems and more overall problems of
diet quality. The continuous lower bound and DQI distance
were each independent predictors of overweight status.
Each one unit increase in the lower bound was associated
with a signi®cant 2% increase in odds of being overweight.
Each one unit increase in the DQI distance was associated
with a signi®cant 1% increase in the odds of being over-
weight.
Diet-quality index pattern
The DQI pattern variables were created to provide informa-
tion on underlying patterns of poor diet quality that might
not be observed with the DQI total score. A DQI lower
bound and DQI distance were calculated for each subject,
with sample means (s.d.) of À27.3 (11.5) and 45.9 (12.8),

respectively. Using the lower bound, distance, and cut-offs
described in the methods section, subjects were classi®ed
into one of six pattern types. Figure 2 shows the mean DQI
lower bounds and distances for the six pattern types.
DQI pattern C vs pattern D
Table 7 provides mean DQI component scores for each of
the DQI pattern types. Patterns C and D had mean total
DQI scores approximating zero, suggestive of optimal diet
quality. We compared pattern D, the DQI pattern with
optimal diet quality, with pattern C, the pattern with
components scores that cancel each other out. As expected,
pattern C scored signi®cantly higher on the energy, total
fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate and alcohol scores, and
signi®cantly lower for the protein and calcium DQI com-
ponents than pattern D. Pattern C diets provided signi®-
cantly lower intakes of carotene-rich vegetables, retinol,
®ber, vitamin C, niacin, ribo¯avin, thiamin and zinc then
pattern D diets (data not shown). In keeping with more
problems of overnutrition, compared with pattern D, pat-
tern C diets were associated with signi®cantly increased
risks of overweight status (OR  1.59, 99% CI: 1.04 ± 2.45,
P-value  0.03) in a logistic regression model. No signi®-
cant differences were observed between patterns C and D
with respect to risk of underweight.
Discussion
This paper had two objectives: (1) to describe the devel-
opment of DQI measures for China that are relevant for
developing country contexts with simultaneous under- and
overnutrition problems; and (2) to explore the ef®cacy of
these tools for research and policy-making. A DQI for
China is needed to understand the causes and consequences
of shifts in whole diets, as opposed to singular nutrients or
food groups. Unlike nutrient de®ciency syndromes, chronic
diseases, which are increasingly prevalent in China, are
thought to involve multiple risk factors and whole pro®les
of nutrient intake, rather than single nutrients. Measures of
overall diet quality capture diets as a whole, and avoid
colinearity problems associated with food- or nutrient-
speci®c measures.
The development of the DQI for China began with
existing DQI methodology for the US (Kant, 1996),
which maximizes information on both macro- and micro-
nutrients, as well as relying on national guidelines to insure
applicability across population sub-groups and easy-inter-
pretation by policy makers. The DQI for China differs from
the US DQI and USDA HEI (Kennedy et al, 1995;
Patterson et al, 1994; Popkin et al, 1996; Haines et al,
1999) by explicitly de®ning diet quality in terms of both
under- and overnutrition, as well as by incorporating
information about the direction, in addition to the distance,
strayed from ideal diet quality. Both the USDA HEI and
UNC-CH DQI provide a composite score showing the
relative distance of a given diet from an ideal: overall,
where is the diet with respect to where it should be? Both
indexes are additive and monotonically related to most
nutrient intakes, such that a medium score re¯ects
a medium intake of most nutrients. While the structure of
the US DQIs is informative and readily interpretable,
these indexes do not provide information on underlying
combinations of dietary problems. When diet quality is
two-dimensional, de®ned to exclude both under- and over-
nutrition, the restriction to direct relationships inherent
in existing DQI structures may be too limiting. Important
information about different patterns of diet quality may be
missed. This DQI was designed to capture whole diet
exposures among adult groups living in China. Adult
RDAs, which are intended for evaluating the diets of
groups, as opposed to individual dietary intake, were used
to determine several of the DQI component scores.
Researchers using this tool should be aware that this DQI
may be inappropriate for individuals, children, adolescents
or elderly groups.
Can the China DQI be used for research or policymaking?
Research and policy-making depend on tools that success-
fully identify and characterize exposures of interest. The
proposed DQI is a ¯exible tool in that it can address
different types of questions with different exposures of
interest. We have shown that the DQI can be used to
position diets along the spectrum from under- to ovenrutri-
tion andaor classify individuals with different combinations
of diet-quality problems. If the interest is in determining
where a diet falls on average, the total DQI score would be
appropriate. If, on the other hand, comparisons between
types of diets are warranted, the DQI pattern approach
would be more useful.
The continuous DQI distance and categorical DQI
patterns provide a quick sense of the range and types of
nutritional problems to tackle. Given that, in the present
analyses, various combinations of under- and overnutrition
problems were apparent, this new methodology may offer
important new information. Using the DQI distance vari-
able, for example, we saw that urban residents have more
problems overall, related to both under- and overnutrition,
than rural residents.
This ®nding is qualitatively different from the ®nding
that urban residents are further along the spectrum towards
overnutrition than rural residents Ð the conclusion
researchers would draw from using the total DQI score.
Knowing that rural residents have bothamore problems can
better inform policy and interventions.
The total DQI score is ef®cacious in that it captures
desired whole diet exposures and covaries with known
correlates of dietary intake. The DQI components each
re¯ected expected dietary patterns, corresponding with
previously reported results. Together the proposed compo-
nents provide an index that allows us to address major
problems in China, including inadequate intake of calcium
and excessive salt intake (related to public health problems
such as hypertension, rickets and osteoporosis) (Ge et al,
1996; Chen & Xu, 1996; Popkin et al, 1993). The total DQI
score was signi®cantly correlated with food and nutrient
intakes, and directly associated with BMI. The DQI total
score correlated as would be expected with urbanarural
residence and income. The DQI pattern scores correlated
with DQI components and weight status, as expected.
Since the purpose of these analyses was to demonstrate
the meaning of the DQI scores by con®rming expected
correlations, the observed associations were unadjusted.
These analyses in no way attempted to establish causal
relationships between the DQI and anthropometric or
sociodemographic variables. Further work is needed to
evaluate the causes and consequences of DQI exposures.
Measurement of dietary data is highly problematic
(Willett, 1998). A comparison of the results from the
1991 CHNS survey with results using identical measure-
ment but more in-depth probing for salt intake suggests that
the 1991 CHNS results do not adequately measure salt

intake. They do, however, capture the remarkably low
variation of salt intake across individuals in China
(Popkin et al, 1997). Despite lowered con®dence in the
available estimates of absolute salt intake, we believe the
1991 CHNS data are adequate for relative ranking of
subjects. The present application of the China DQI to this
data may have misclassi®ed subjects in a way which could
affect the overall DQI scores. Optimal performance of the
China DQI depends on valid multi-level dietary data.
The China DQI captures variation along several compo-
nents of diet quality, as well as complex relationships
between these multiple dimensions.* Considering that the
index appears sensitive to both diet and weight risk factors
for under- and overnutrition, it constitutes a useful tool for
studying the nutrition transition and epidemiologic trends
in China. More speci®cally, this tool allows monitoring of
overall dietary change and exploration of the effects of
whole-diet exposures de®ned according to current Dietary
Guidelines for Chinese Residents. The development of
similar DQI could inform nutrition monitoring and
epidemiologic research in other developing countries.
