Background: Hearing loss affects health and quality of
life. The prevalence of hearing loss may be growing
because of an aging population and increasing noise
exposure. However, accurate national estimates of hear-
ing loss prevalence based on recent objective criteria are
lacking.
Methods: We determined hearing loss prevalence
among US adults and evaluated differences by demo-
graphic characteristics and known risk factors for hear-
ing loss (smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascular
risks). A national cross-sectional survey with audiomet-
ric testing was performed. Participants were 5742 US
adults aged 20 to 69 years who participated in the
audiometric component of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. The main
outcome measure was 25-dB or higher hearing loss at
speech frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) and at high
frequencies (3, 4, and 6 kHz).
Results: In 2003-2004, 16.1% of US adults (29 million
Americans) had speech-frequency hearing loss. In the
youngest age group (20-29 years), 8.5% exhibited hearing
loss, and the prevalence seems to be growing among this
agegroup.Oddsofhearinglosswere5.5-foldhigherinmen
vs women and 70% lower in black subjects vs white sub-
jects. Increases in hearing loss prevalence occurred earlier
among participants with smoking, noise exposure, and
cardiovascular risks.
Conclusions: Hearing loss is more prevalent among US
adultsthanpreviouslyreported.TheprevalenceofUShear-
inglossdiffersacrossracial/ethnicgroups,andourdatadem-
onstrate associations with risk factors identified in prior
smaller-cohort studies. Our findings also suggest that hear-
ing loss prevention (through modifiable risk factor reduc-
tion) and screening should begin in young adulthood.

Hearing loss is a societal problem. It is
known to be highly prevalent,13-16 and the
costs of increased needs and diminished
autonomy associated with hearing loss are
shared by society.17 The prevalence of hear-
ing loss in the United States is predicted
to rise significantly because of an aging
population and the growing use of per-
sonal listening devices.18-21 Indeed, there
is concern that we may be facing an epi-
demic of hearing impairment.22
Despite this concern, we lack a rigorous
estimate of the current national prevalence
of hearing loss. The best estimate (28 mil-
lionAmericans)isbasedonself-report,which

We herein report the prevalence of
hearing loss among US adults aged 20 to
69 years based on data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 1999-2004. We evalu-
ated the effects of demographic charac-
teristics on hearing loss prevalence. The
effect of noise exposure was also consid-
ered,25-27 as were cardiovascular risks that
have been shown to have a role in hear-
ing loss.28-30 Such epidemiological infor-
mation can facilitate the delivery of gen-
eral health care and preventive, screening,
and rehabilitative services to individuals
with hearing impairment.

METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The NHANES is an ongoing cross-sectional survey of the ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Ev-
ery 2 years, 12 000 to 13 000 individuals who are representa-
tive of the US population are selected at random based on
demographic distributions. The participation rate in the past
several cycles has ranged from 79% to 84%. Further details of
the NHANES sampling process are available.31
The 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004 NHANES col-
lected audiometric data on a nationally representative sample
of adults aged 20 to 69 years. We combined these 2-year cycles
of data to analyze 6 years of data per National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) recommendations.31 A total of 31 126 sub-
jects of all ages took part in the NHANES from 1999 to 2004;
12 056 participants were aged 20 to 69 years. Half of those aged
20 to 69 years were selected to participate in an audiometry
component (described herein). Participants using hearing aids
who were unable to remove them for testing were excluded from
audiometric testing. Participants were also excluded if they had
sufficient otalgia to prevent the use of test headphones. The
NHANES documentation did not report how many individu-
als were excluded for these reasons. Sign language interpret-
ers were available if individuals with deafness were encoun-
tered during recruitment. The eligible sample size was 5742
participants. Sample weights for the combined 6-year sample
were computed per NCHS guidelines.31 These sample weights
accounted for individual nonparticipation and preserved the
national representativeness of the subsample.
AUDIOMETRIC MEASURES
Audiometry was performed by mobile examination center health
technicians trained by a certified audiologist from the Na-
tional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Testing was
conducted in a mobile examination center sound-isolated room.
Instrumentation for the audiometric component included an
audiometer (AD226; Interacoustics AS, Assens, Denmark) with
standard headphones (TDH-39; Telephonics Corporation, Farm-
ingdale, New York) and insert earphones (EarTone 3A; Ety-
motic Research, Elk Grove Village, Illinois).

abilityofthesubject'sresponses.Pure-toneaudiogramswerenot

mentedreasons;thenonresponseswerecodedasmissingvalues.
Further details of the audiometric testing procedures are avail-
able online (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/au.pdf).
Hearing loss at the speech frequencies was defined as a pure-
tone mean of 25 dB or higher at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in either
ear. We subdivided speech-frequency hearing loss into mutu-
ally exclusive unilateral and bilateral categories. High-
frequency hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone mean of 25
dB or higher at 3, 4 and 6 kHz in 1 ear (unilateral) or both ears
(bilateral). Using data from large population studies showing
that frequencies of 3 kHz or higher are the earliest and most
severely affected,32 we assessed the prevalence of high-
frequency hearing loss, which is sometimes concomitant with
speech-frequency hearing loss. We evaluated for possible dif-
ferences in pathogenesis or progression patterns of speech-
frequency and high-frequency hearing loss.
DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEARING-RELATED
VARIABLES
Trained interviewers administered detailed questionnaires.33
Age at interview was binned by decade. Race/ethnicity was
grouped as non-Hispanic white (hereafter, white), non-
Hispanic black (hereafter, black), Mexican American, or
other. Education was grouped as less than high school, high
school diploma (including general equivalency diploma),
and beyond high school. Four participants had missing edu-
cation data.
Exposure to recreational noise was determined by a ques-
tion asking if the subject had ever been exposed outside of work
to loud noise (eg, power tools or loud music) for a mean of at
least once a month for 1 year (8 participants had missing data).
Exposure to weapon noise was defined as exposure outside of
work to the noise of a firearm a mean of at least once a month
for 1 year (6 participants had missing data).
A complete smoking history included the number of years
and the current number of cigarettes smoked per day. Pack-
years of smoking were computed, and participants were di-
vided into smoking categories (nonsmoker, 20 pack-years of
smoking, or 20 pack-years of smoking). There were substan-
tial missing data (n=467) on the quantity of tobacco smoked,
so a separate category was made for persons who were ever
smokers with unknown pack-years of smoking (14 partici-
pants had missing data). Hypertension was defined as self-
reported physician diagnosis, the use of antihypertensive medi-
cation, or a mean systolic blood pressure exceeding 140 mm Hg
or a mean diastolic blood pressure exceeding 90 mm Hg at the
time of examination (7 participants had missing data). Diabe-
tes mellitus was defined as self-reported physician diagnosis,
the use of antihyperglycemic medication, an 8-hour fasting glu-
cose level of 126 mg/dL or higher (to convert glucose to mil-
limoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), or a nonfasting glucose
level of 200 mg/dL or higher.
Self-reported hearing status was determined by direct ques-
tioning. Those who reported "good hearing" were coded as not
self-reporting hearing loss, whereas those who reported "a little
trouble hearing," "a lot of trouble hearing," or "deafness" were
coded as self-reporting hearing loss. Participants usually re-
sponded on their own behalf. Only in rare situations were proxy
respondents used.34
Exposure to occupational noise was defined as noise expo-
sure in the workplace (requiring speaking in a raised voice) for
at least 3 months. Occupational noise exposure data were un-
available for the 2003-2004 NHANES, so all analyses involv-
ing occupational noise were based on 4 years of data from 1999
to 2002 and used 4-year sample weights. From 1999 to 2002,
there were 21 004 participants, 8143 of whom were aged 20 to
69 years. The eligible sample size for the audiometric compo-
nent from 1999 to 2002 was 3853 participants. No occupa-
tional noise exposure data were available for 6.3% of the au-
diometrically assessed subsample. No differences in the
prevalences of speech-frequency or high-frequency hearing loss
were noted between participants with and without occupa-
tional noise exposure data.
Of the initial sample of 5742 adults who underwent audi-
ometry, participants were excluded if there were unreliable
audiometric measurements (ie, there was a 10-dB difference
between the 1-kHz test-retest thresholds [n=444]) or if there
was a nonresponse code to audiometric testing (n=10), yield-
ing a final sample size of 5288 participants. No significant dif-
ferences were noted between included and excluded partici-
pants for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. In the 4-year sample of
3853 adults (for analyses involving the occupational noise ex-
posure variable), 326 participants were excluded (6 for non-
response and 320 for unreliable testing), yielding a final sample

age, and race/ethnicity.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We estimated the prevalence of speech-frequency and high-
frequency hearing loss among the overall population and as
stratified by noise exposure, cardiovascular risks, and demo-
graphic characteristics. Analyses were performed for unilat-
eral and bilateral hearing loss. For ease of interpretation, we
herein present analyses of unilateral and bilateral loss at speech
frequencies and at high frequencies only in the first reported
result. Thereafter, we distinguish between unilateral and bi-
lateral hearing loss only in the speech-frequency response.
We explored the progression in hearing loss prevalence with
age by sex and race/ethnicity categories. Within each age cat-
egory, we used the 2 F statistic to evaluate whether preva-
lence levels differed across demographic groups.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate
the odds of having hearing loss associated with demographic
characteristics, adjusting for noise exposure and cardiovascu-
lar risks. We evaluated the validity of self-reported hearing loss
against a criterion standard of audiometric measurement. The
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive val-
ues of self-reported hearing loss were considered as measures
of validity. We also assessed whether the validity of self-
reported hearing loss differed across demographic groups.
All analyses were adjusted for the survey design using sta-
tistical software (SURVEY procedures in SAS; SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, North Carolina). Sample weights were incorporated into
all analyses by using NCHS instructions (WEIGHT statement
in SAS). All prevalences, odds ratios, and variance estimates
are from weighted analyses unless otherwise specified. P.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The overall prevalence of unilateral and bilateral hearing
loss among the US population aged 20 to 69 years in 2003-
2004 (the most recent dataset) was 16.1% (7.3% bilateral
and 8.9% unilateral), corresponding to 29 million Ameri-
cans (Table 1). Thirty-one percent of participants (equiva-
lent to 55 million Americans) had high-frequency hearing
loss. The prevalences of unilateral and bilateral high-
frequency hearing loss were 12% and 19%, respectively.
We observed pronounced differences in hearing loss
prevalence by demographic characteristics. Prevalences
of speech-frequency and high-frequency hearing loss (uni-
lateral and bilateral) were higher among men and among
white, older, and less educated participants (Table 1).
Hearing loss, particularly at high frequencies, was present
in the third (8.5% prevalence) and fourth (17% preva-
lence) decades of life. Participants with exposure to oc-
cupational, leisure-time, and firearm noise had more uni-
lateral, bilateral, and high-frequency hearing loss
compared with participants without those noise expo-
sures. Hearing loss prevalences were higher among par-
ticipants with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heavy
tobacco use (20 pack-years).
We evaluated whether the pattern of increasing preva-
lence with age differed by sex or race/ethnicity (Table 2).

White and Mexican American men had the highest preva-
lences of bilateral and high-frequency hearing loss, and this
difference was first noted in the third decade of life, par-
ticularly among white men. The prevalence of high-
frequency hearing loss was 15% among white and Mexi-
canAmericanmenaged20to29yearscomparedwith6.8%
among black men and 2.1% to 4.1% among women of the
same age. Differences by sex and race/ethnicity in hearing
loss prevalence (particularly high-frequency hearing loss)
became pronounced among subjects aged 40 to 49 years:
57% of white men had high-frequency hearing loss com-
pared with 23% of black men and 13% to 20% of women.
White men aged 60 to 69 years had a 93% prevalence of
high-frequency hearing loss; men generally had higher
prevalencesofbilateral,unilateral,andhigh-frequencyhear-
ing loss across the age range compared with women, and
white women generally had greater hearing loss than black
and Mexican American women. Overall tests for differ-
ences among demographic groups showed statistically sig-
nificant differences in high-frequency hearing loss preva-
lence at all age levels.
We explored the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity,
smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascular risks on the
most prevalent form of hearing loss assessed (high-
frequency hearing loss) (Figure). We show separate
graphs for male, female, white, and black participants;
graphs could not be created for Mexican Americans and
for groups of other races/ethnicities because of a scar-
city of observations within data subsets. Prevalence trends
were similar for bilateral and high-frequency hearing loss;
graphs of high-frequency hearing loss are shown be-
cause prevalences were higher and the trends easier to
discern. Among white participants (male and female;
Figure, D) and male participants (all races/ethnicities;
Figure, A), the prevalence of hearing loss increased as a
function of age and with increasing risk factors. This re-
lationship was most apparent in white male participants
(Figure, C), among whom high-frequency hearing loss
was almost 100% prevalent among those aged 60 to 69
years at all risk factor levels. However, steep increases
in hearing loss prevalence occur earlier among partici-
pants with smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascu-
lar risks (at age 40-49 years) compared with partici-
pants without these risk factors (at age 60-69 years).
We evaluated whether the observed differences in hear-
ing loss prevalence by demographic characteristics could
be explained by differences in noise exposure and car-
diovascular risks (Table 3). In multiple regression analy-
sis, male subjects and white, older, and less educated par-
ticipants had significantly higher odds of bilateral and
high-frequency hearing loss, even after adjustment for
noise exposure and cardiovascular risks. We subse-
quently restricted analyses to participants without noise
exposure (n=2293), without cardiovascular risks
(n=1395), and without noise exposure or cardiovascu-
lar risks (n=926). Significant associations among age, sex,
and race/ethnicity with bilateral and high-frequency hear-
ing loss persisted (data not shown). The associations be-
tween demographic characteristics and unilateral hear-
ing loss were generally weaker.
Given that the most widely cited national estimate of
hearing loss prevalence is based on self-report,22 we evalu-

ated the accuracy of self-report as a measure of hearing
loss compared with a criterion standard of audiometric
measurement (Table 4). Overall, the sensitivity of self-
reported hearing loss was low (range, 41%-65%). The sen-
sitivity of self-report was significantly higher for bilat-
eral hearing loss (65%) than for unilateral hearing loss
(46%) or high-frequency hearing loss (41%).
Finally, in light of concern that hearing loss is grow-
ing, particularly among young people, we explored
whether hearing loss prevalences changed between 1999-
2000 and the 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 datasets
(Table 5). As already reported, the overall prevalences
of speech-frequency and high-frequency hearing loss
among the population changed little. However, in analy-
ses stratified by age, we observed an increase in high-
frequency (3, 4, and 6 kHz) pure-tone (8.9-10 dB) means
among subjects aged 20 to 29 years from 1999 to 2004.
This difference was statistically significant between the
1999-2000 and 2001-2002 datasets; no other differ-
ences achieved statistical significance. We observed simi-
lar trends for speech-frequency hearing loss (data not
shown).
COMMENT
Findings from this study suggest that hearing loss is more
common among US adults than previously reported. Our
estimate of 29 million Americans was among subjects aged
20 to 69 years and exceeds the often-cited estimate of 28
million Americans among all ages who were found (in
1989) to have hearing loss based on self-report.22 This
increased prevalence may in part reflect a true increase
in prevalence driven by the aging population (repre-
sented as a skew toward the older age groups in our data)18
and a heightened risk posed by exposure to damaging
noise.20,21
The difference in prevalence estimates may also re-
sult from differences in the method used to assess hear-
ing loss. Estimates based on self-report may be inaccu-
rate given the observed tendency of some individuals to
deny or minimize their hearing loss. Indeed, our find-
ings corroborate that the sensitivity of self-reported hear-
ing loss for identifying audiometrically confirmed hear-
ing loss is poor. Therefore, estimates based on self-
reported hearing loss may underestimate the true extent
of the prevalence of a disorder. Comparisons of our preva-
lence findings with other national estimates are difficult
because of differences in the age distributions of the popu-
lations surveyed. As would be expected, the present preva-
lence estimate of 16.1% (based on US adults aged 20-69
years) is lower than national estimates derived from adults
of all ages (eg, 27% in Norway,35 35% in the United King-
dom,36 and 22% in Australia37). In addition, our preva-
lence may be an underestimate given that the audiomet-
ric instrumentation used in the survey had a hard upper
limit of hearing level, possibly causing a downward bias
in pure-tone means.
Hearing loss is highly prevalent among persons older
than 70 years.13,16 However, few studies35,38 have evalu-
ated when hearing loss first develops among large popu-
lations of adults and whether prevalences increase gradu-
ally or nonlinearly with age. The degree to which trends
in the prevalence of hearing loss differ by sex and race/
ethnicity has not been shown, to our knowledge. We
found that hearing loss, specifically high-frequency hear-
ing loss, was present in 8.5% of the youngest age group
(20-29 years) and in 17% of the group aged 30 to 39 years.
Our data suggest that the prevalence of hearing loss is
increasing among these younger age groups. In addi-
tion, a disproportionate burden of hearing loss is expe-
rienced by male and white (and to a lesser extent Mexi-
can American) participants and is manifest in the third
decade of life. Discrepancies in hearing loss prevalence
by sex and race/ethnicity have been noted among chil-
dren as well,39 suggesting that divergences in hearing level
are set in motion at earlier life stages.
The results of our study also suggest that hearing loss
develops first at high frequencies. Because high-
frequency hearing loss alters the reception of consonant
sounds (or phonemes), it reduces speech recognition.40
In addition, high-frequency hearing loss may be a pre-
cursor of further significant hearing loss affecting mid-
and lower-spectrum speech frequencies. We found that
individuals are substantially less likely to report or be
aware of high-frequency hearing loss compared with bi-
lateral hearing loss. Therefore, audiometric screening is

critical to capture the true prevalence of hearing loss, par-
ticularly at an early pathogenetic stage among young
adults.
These data show that the prevalence of hearing loss
increased with age among all demographic groups and
at all levels of smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovas-
cular risks. Hearing loss prevalence progressed at an ear-
lier age among participants with smoking, noise expo-
sure, and cardiovascular risks. Smoking cessation,
reduction of noise exposure, and effective treatment of
diabetes mellitus and hypertension may delay the onset
of hearing loss. Addressing some of the modifiable health
risks associated with aging could result in further hear-
ing loss prevalence reductions.
In this study, approximately 50% of speech-
frequency hearing loss was unilateral, and 50% was bi-
lateral. Age had a markedly smaller association with uni-
lateral hearing loss prevalence, and male, white, and less
educated participants had a modestly increased risk of
unilateral hearing loss. These findings suggest that uni-
lateral and bilateral hearing losses may be mediated by
distinct pathophysiologic processes among susceptible
populations with different risk factors. Unilateral hear-
ing loss may be associated with more focal processes, in-
cluding thromboembolic phenomena, infections (eg, oti-
tis media and mumps), local tumors (eg, vestibular
schwannoma), and certain types of noise exposure (eg,
firearm noise).41 Bilateral hearing loss may be associ-
ated with more diffuse or systemic exposures such as oc-
cupational noise exposure or microvascular disease. Risk
factors for unilateral hearing loss seem not to segregate
as closely with age, sex, or racial/ethnic factors.
The NHANES data are comprehensive and nation-
ally representative; nevertheless, there are several poten-
tial sources of bias in the data that must be considered.
Participants were selected at random based on demo-
graphic criteria; it is possible that medically unwell in-
dividuals were more (or perhaps less) likely to partici-
pate. Approximately 8% of individuals had missing
audiometric data, which was not accounted for by the
sample weights; this may also have introduced bias.
It is important for health care providers (ie, primary
care physicians, specialists, and other medical person-
nel and allied health professionals) to fully appreciate the
manifold and nuanced effects of hearing loss. Mild hear-
ing loss can impair speech processing, particularly if
speech is rapid or delivered with an unfamiliar accent or
voice42 or if multiple talkers in large rooms generate re-
verberant noise.43 Therefore, verbal communication dif-
ficulties are most prominent in settings where people
gather. Reduced social connectivity likely mediates the
observed associations between hearing loss and depres-
sion, cognitive decline, reduced quality of life, and in-
creased morbidity and mortality.5-8,10-12
The public health implications of our findings are un-
derscored by the dramatic projected increases in the preva-
lence of hearing loss. Although these data are cross-
sectional, they offer some insight into the progression of
hearing loss and identify particularly vulnerable groups.
The results of our study suggest that prevention (through
risk factor reduction) and screening must begin at least
in young adulthood and that efforts should be intensi-
fied among white and Mexican American men. Hearing
loss reduces health-related quality of life9 and access to
heath care.11 Minimizing this morbidity through hear-
ing loss prevention and management programs may pro-
duce substantial public health benefits.
