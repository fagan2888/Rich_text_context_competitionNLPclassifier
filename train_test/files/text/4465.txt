Introduction
The development of peer relationships during early and mid-
dle childhood has been extensively studied, both at a group
level (e.g., Gifford-Smith & Brownell, 2003; Hay, Payne, &
Chadwick, 2004) and at a dyadic level, with siblings (e.g.,
Dunn & Kendrick, 1982) and friends (e.g., Berndt, 2004;
Bukowski, 2001). However, there is a type of relationship
that has been rarely addressed in pre-pubertal youth: chil-
dren's "romance" (see Furman & Rose, 2015, for a discus-
sion about this relationship in adolescence). An obvious
reason for this neglect is the common idea that young chil-
dren, being sexually immature, cannot have real love emo-
tions and, a fortiori, they cannot form relationships based on
an emotion they do not feel.
In contrast with this notion, Hatfield, Schmitz, Cornelius,
and Rapson (1988) proposed that virtually all children can
experience not only "companionate love" (with feelings of
fondness, liking, and interpersonal commitment) but also
"passionate love," that is, an intense desire for union with
another person. In a study conducted by these scholars with
336 children and adolescents 4 to 18 years old, none of the
participants found it difficult to understand the terms "boy-
friend" or "girlfriend," to remember children in their entou-
rage who had a partner of this sort or to name a peer of the
opposite sex they would like for a romantic engagement. To
assess the extent to which passionate love was present at the
various ages, the authors devised the Juvenile Love Scale, an
instrument subsequently included in the Handbook of
Sexuality-Related Measures (3rd ed.; Fisher, Davis, Yarber,
& Davis, 2011) that requires rating the subject's agreement
with sentences such as "I'd feel bad if I thought that [name of
subject's girlfriend or boyfriend, real or desired] liked some-
body else better than me" and "When [name] is around I
really want to touch him/her and be touched." Using this
scale, the authors found that the intensity of love in younger
participants was comparable with that of the older partici-
pants; girls older than 6 years tended to receive higher scores
than boys.
More recently, Brechet (2015) has demonstrated that chil-
dren from 6 to 10 years of age are able to represent the emo-
tion of love in their drawings. The author asked the
participants to draw a person as a basic reference, and then
compared this drawing with a second figure portraying "a
person who is very much in love" ("amoureux" in the origi-
nal task, a word specifically referring to romantic love).
Children used various pictorial devices to distinguish the

Friendship and Romantic Relationships
During Early and Middle Childhood
Eleonora Cannoni1 and Anna Silvia Bombi1
Abstract
Ideas about romantic relationships have been studied in adolescents. This article extends this study to younger children.
We asked two hundred seventy 5- to 11-year-olds to draw "two children who have a romance" and "two children who
are friends," and we subsequently interviewed each participant about the characters' relationships. The drawings were
coded with three scales of Pictorial Assessment of Interpersonal Relationships (PAIR), an instrument by Bombi, Pinto, and
Cannoni. Interviews were categorized by the characters' age and identity and by the distinguishing features of romance and
friendship: location, intimacy, activity, personal characteristics, and emotions. Scale scores were compared with variance
analyses, whereas the categories frequencies were submitted to chi-square. Results showed that all participants were able to
distinguish the two relationships, even if the descriptions increased in detail with age. Girls provided more information than
boys about romance, but were less inclined to talk about their own romantic experiences.

person in love from the reference figure: the symbol of heart
(60% of the drawings), the presence of another person (39%),
words of love (28%), metaphoric indices of a pleasant envi-
ronment such as blue sky or little birds (18%), reddened
cheeks (18%), heart-shaped eyes (17%), and sophisticated
outfit (15%). The mean number of indicators increased sig-
nificantly with age (from 1.62 at 6 years to 1.91 at 8 years to
2.37 at 10 years), but it is noteworthy that all children, even
the youngest, included at least one indicator.
Taken together, the two above studies propose an image
of "love-competent" young children, even if the source and
extent of this competence remains speculative.
In fact, the seminal work of Hatfield et al. (1988) was
repeated neither systematically, nor cross-culturally, so that
we do not have a great deal of information concerning young
children's ideas about romance generally (Neeman, Hubbard,
& Masten, 1995).
The literature about early romantic experiences typically
focus on adolescents (see Furman, Brown, & Feiring, 2009,
for a comprehensive review), and even the studies about
early adolescence only take into account ages 11 (e.g.,
Brendgen, Vitaro, Doyle, Markiewicz, & Bukowski, 2002)
and 12 years (e.g., Giordano, Longmore, & Manning, 2006).
The few researches including younger participants we
were able to find were concentrated on children at the thresh-
old of puberty and were mainly sociological or ethnographic
explorative reports based on in-depth study of small numbers
of children. For instance, Thorne and Luria (2004), observing
fourth and fifth graders in two schools of California and
Massachusetts during the less supervised moments of the day
(in the playground, hallways, lunchroom), found that children
engaged in "hetherosexually charged rituals" such as a chase-
and-kiss game, or teasing somebody for liking a peer of the
opposite sex; sometimes, a child revealed to a friend of hav-
ing a crush, but according to the authors, these romances were
more often imagined than real. Experiences of exchanging
"Valentines" as indices of romantic socialization were also
examined by Bright (1997). Mention of romantic relation-
ships emerged, even if not explicitly requested, in a study by
Walton, Weatherall, and Jackson (2002) who collected writ-
ten accounts of conflict episodes from fourth, fifth, and sixth
graders in some U.S. public schools; in a small number of
cases (33 out of 689), the stories of conflict were focused on
problems arising in the context of romantic relationships.
Also, Renold (2003, 2006), who conducted a year-long eth-
nographic study in two primary school classes in England,
found that children between 10 and 11 years old spontane-
ously talked about cross-gender interactions and relationships
of romantic nature. Recently, a work by Holford, Renold, and
Huuki (2013) took into account younger children (5-6 years
old); their article provides an ethnographic report of some
games involving children's kissing, sometimes accompanied
by proposals of marriage, but--as far one can gather from the
described examples--this behavior did not happen in the con-
text of dyadic relationships.
The studies summarized in the previous paragraph agree
in considering the reference to romance more a way of rein-
forcing the distinction between the separate social worlds of
boys and girls, than genuine loving experiences of some sort.
However, the children's romantic talk, teasing and play, is
not irrelevant for the subsequent adolescent experiences, set-
ting the stage for the different perspectives with which teen-
agers will approach their relationships to the opposite sex.As
Thorne and Luria (1986) clearly stated,
Children draw on sexual meanings to maintain gender
segregation--to make cross-gender interaction risky and to
mark and ritualize boundaries between "the boys" and "the
girls." In their separate gender groups, girls and boys learn
somewhat different patterns of bonding--boys sharing the
arousal of group rule-breaking; girls emphasizing the
construction of intimacy, and themes of romance. (p. 188)
A more systematic psychological study, involving 1,664
participants from 8 to 14 years old, was conducted by Carlson
and Rose (2007) in six U.S. Midwestern school districts;
58.4% of third graders and 49.7% of fifth graders reported to
have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, which was not simply a
friend who happened to be a boy (for girls) or a girl (for
boys). It may seem surprising that figures are lower for older
children (seventh grade: 37%; ninth grade: 39.5%). However,
this might be explained by the high proportion of younger
children who made non-reciprocal nominations. In fact
(excluding children with out-of-class romantic relationships
for whom reciprocity could not be assessed), the percentages
of unilateral naming was 65.4% in third grade, 54.6% in fifth
grade, 40.6% in seventh grade, and only 10% in ninth grade.
According to the authors, young children could attribute a
romantic meaning to friendly behaviors, which would imply
that their idea of romance is not well defined, and at least
partially overlapping with cross-gender friendship.
This issue, however, had been examined in another psycho-
logical study by Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, and Pepler (1999)
with different conclusions. These authors asked 1,755 children
from 9 to 14 years to explain the difference between cross-sex
friendship and romance, providing the boys with the following
sentence stems: "A female friend is . . ." and "A girlfriend is
. . ." (for girls, the stems were "A male friend is . . ." and "A
boyfriend is . . ."). Only 1% of the participant denied the exis-
tenceofdifferencesbetweencross-sexfriendshipandromance.
Descriptions of both friends and romantic partners were coded
into four categories: passion (including references to special
liking, intense caring, love, crushes, romance, physical attrac-
tion, sexual contact), affiliation (liking, friendship, compan-
ionship, dating), intimacy (trust, self-disclosure, closeness,
support), and commitment (long-term alliance, exclusivity).
Passion and commitment were almost uniquely associated
with romance, while intimacy was equally present in romance
and friendship, increasing for both relationships with age.
Because affiliation was preeminent in the descriptions of
Cannoni and Bombi 3
friends, but was mentioned quite often also for boyfriends or
girlfriends, the subcodes of this category were analyzed sepa-
rately, showing that in cross-sex friendships, affiliation
referred only to companionship, while in romantic relation-
ships affiliation referred to both companionship and dating.
Similarly, the few mentions of passion in the context of cross-
sex friendship consisted of intense liking and caring, whereas
physicalandsexualcontactswerementionedonlyforromance.
Interestingly, the ability to differentiate the two types of rela-
tionships did not depend on direct experience, which was quite
low for both romance and cross-sex friendship; the amount of
interaction with friends of the opposite sex and with romantic
partners, however, was related to the frequency of reference to
intimacy.
The Rationale for Our Study
The available literature, while pointing to the relevance of
romantic love for young children, leaves almost unexplored
the representation of romantic relationships before late
childhood.
Our study follows the lead of Hatfield et al. (1998) and
Brechet (2015) who suggested that even very young chil-
dren know what "passionate love" is. Our approach, how-
ever, differs from both of these studies in that we consider it
necessary to begin with an in-depth descriptive account not
only of romance but also of friendship. One reason is that
we have only two systematic studies about the children's
ability to distinguish the features of these two relationships
(Carlson & Rose, 2007; Connolly et al., 1999), and they are
about older children; moreover, they produced different
results. Another reason is that we lack completely young
children's spontaneous accounts of what romance is,
although the systematic study of friendship was developed
on the basis of detailed descriptive reports (e.g., Selman,
1981; Youniss, 1980). Our study is aimed precisely at pro-
viding a descriptive account of children's representation of
both relationships, to verify if and how young children are
able to distinguish them. To this end, we used a combination
of methods: drawing and interview.
Drawing has the capacity to facilitate children's reflec-
tion and subsequent verbal expression, as is well known by
clinicians (see Davis, 2011, as a recent example of this clini-
cal use of drawing); however, drawing as a complement of
verbal expression has been used also in research contexts
(e.g., Yuen, 2004). One reason for the drawing efficacy in
facilitating the child's verbalization could be its function of
emotion regulation, as recently demonstrated by Drake and
Winner (2013). Thanks to this function, drawing opens the
way to talk about emotionally laden topics, which children
tend to keep to themselves, as could be the case for romantic
relationships.
Pictorial representations of relationships can be interesting
per se, and have been traditionally used in clinical settings
(Madigan, Ladd, & Goldberg, 2003; Pinto & Bombi, 2008).
Here, however, we did not apply a symbolical interpretation,
which has encountered a variety of objections (see Thomas &
Silk, 1990, for a critical analysis of traditional approaches,
and also Shiakou, 2012, for a more recent summary of these
criticisms). Rather, we used drawings only for their explicit
communicative potential, adopting PAIR (Pictorial
Assessment of Interpersonal Relationships), an empirically
based instrument devised by Bombi, Pinto, and Cannoni
(2007) and subsequently used by many scholars (e.g., Laghi
et al., 2013; Laghi et al., 2014; Lecce, Pagnin, & Pinto, 2009;
Misailidi, Bonoti, & Savva, 2012; Rabaglietti, Vacirca,
Zucchetti, & Ciarano, 2012; Sándor, Fülöp, & Sebestyén,
2012). PAIR requires each participant to draw one or more
pictures of two persons, to illustrate the relationship between
them. This way of presenting the task makes it clear the com-
municative, non playful nature of the drawing to be produced.
The data are then analyzed with different scales, which can be
used--according to the research aims--to evaluate the physi-
cal and psychological affinity of the figures (Scale of
Similarity), their comparative importance (Scale of Value),
their relationship (Scales of Cohesion and Distancing), and
their emotional state (Scale of Emotion). To enhance the
validity and depth of information gathered with drawings,
Bombi et al. (2007) suggested using contrastive tasks, in
which children are required to represent two instances of the
same relationship (e.g., two friends when they get along well
and when they have a quarrel) or two relationships (e.g., you
and your mother; you and your father). A contrastive strategy
is especially useful in the present study, because it allows the
discovery of similarities and differences between children's
romance and friendship, the most widely experienced rela-
tionship with peers. In particular, the Value Scale can show if
the parity between partners, which is characteristic of friend-
ship (Hartup, 1989) also applies to romantic relationships; the
Cohesion and Distancing Scales can show if the partners'
connectedness, which in friends' dyads can coexist with the
need for autonomy (Bombi & Pinto, 1994), is stronger in
romantic couples.
The combination of drawing and interview is especially
important here, because children are not entirely at ease
when talking about romantic behaviors (e.g., kissing); how-
ever, children's romance cannot be understood through pic-
torial representations alone, because some characteristics of
partners are not easy or are impossible to draw (e.g., feelings,
age). In sum, a multi-method approach was more promising
than a single instrument to gather a rich description of chil-
dren's romance and friendship.
Hypotheses
Using the joint information of drawings and interviews, we
enlarged the scope of the study, focusing on (a) the personal
characteristics of friends and romantic partners and (b) the
features of friendship and romance; for both aspects, we
checked for possible differences linked to age and sex.
4 SAGE Open
Personal Characteristics
We hypothesized that friends would be more similar to each
other than romantic partners, because homophyly and the
attempt at achieving a balance of power are well-known fea-
tures of friendship (Berndt, 1986; Tesser, Campbell, &
Smith, 1984); love, however, requires complementarity, for
example, in terms of emotional dependence and caring for
the other (for a discussion of these forms of complementarity
in love relationships, see Shaver, Morgan, & Wu, 1996).
Analyzing the identity attributed to friends and romantic
partners was also a way to gain some information, albeit
indirect, about the prevalence of personal romantic experi-
ences; we hypothesized that children would refer mostly to
imaginary characters in the case of romance and mostly to
real children (including themselves) in the case of friendship.
In fact, friendship is a virtually universal experience during
childhood (Krappmann, 1996) whereas the sociological and
ethnographic studies summarized above (Holford et al.,
2013; Renold, 2003, 2006; Thorne & Luria, 2004) suggest
that children's romantic behavior, especially for the youngest
(Holford et al., 2013) is mainly a ritualized way to reinforce
gender difference and does not imply necessarily a direct
involvement in sustained relationships.
Features of the Two Relationships
These features should emerge from partners' behaviors,
portrayed and described. Following Connolly et al. (1999),
we expected that children would be able to distinguish
friendship and romance, depicting the first as an affiliative
and companionate bond, less intimate and emotional than
the second. Moreover, friendship allows a large variety of
shared activities with the only exclusion of those carrying a
sexual meaning; however, even if boyfriends and girl-
friends spend their time in a variety of non-sexual and non-
gendered activities (Carlson, 2006), it is probable that
children would use especially sexualized and more intimate
interactions to distinguish romantic couples from pairs of
friends.
The ability to distinguish romance and friendship should
be already present in children younger than those interviewed
by Connolly et al. (1999), given the early awareness of pas-
sionate love demonstrated by Hatfield et al. (1988) and by
Brechet (2015); however, we expected that the representa-
tions of young children should be less detailed than that of
older, more experienced children.
Finally, in view of the different emotional socialization of
boys and girls (Chaplin, Cole, & Zahn-Waxler, 2005) and
especially their different experiences in the romantic arena
(Renold, 2003, 2006; Thorne & Luria, 1986), we expected
that the characterization of "romantic partnership" would
differ somehow in boys and girls, but the lack of previous
research did not allowed us to develop more detailed
hypotheses.
Method
Participants
With the consent of parents and school authorities, 270 chil-
dren from 5 to 11 years of age participated in the study. There
were six age groups: kindergarten (20 boys, 24 girls; M age
= 5.6), first grade (22 boys, 23 girls; M age = 6.2), second
grade (22 boys, 21 girls; M age = 7.5), third grade (23 boys,
23 girls; M age = 8.4), fourth grade (23 boys, 23 girls; M age
= 9.6), and fifth grade (23 boys, 23 girls; M age = 10.7). To
represent a variety of social environments, one boy and one
girl were randomly chosen from various kindergarten and
primary school classes in 24 locations in southern and central
Italy. Categorized by parents' occupations, participants
belong mainly to middle- and upper-middle-class (fathers:
12% blue-collar workers, students, or unemployed; 21%
self-employed or shopkeepers; 33% technicians, teachers,
employees; and 34% professionals or white-collar managers;
mothers: 45% housewives; 8% blue-collar workers; 30%
technicians, teachers, employees; and 17% professionals or
white-collar managers).
Measures
To talk about romantic relationships could be embarrassing
for a child, especially with an unfamiliar adult. This is why
we resorted to drawing, a less direct form of information,
followed by a short interview based on the drawing
contents.
Drawings were collected and scored with PAIR, the above
described instrument by Bombi et al. (2007). In this study,
children were asked to make two separate drawings: (friend-
ship drawing, FD) "two children who are friends" and
(romantic drawing, RD) "two children who are `engaged.'"
Note that in Italian the masculine plural "bambini" is gram-
matically generic and gender free, applying to all combina-
tions of gender; hence, children could interpret the request as
to draw two girls, two boys, or a girl and a boy.
The interviews were conducted to complement the infor-
mation provided by the drawings (a) about the personal char-
acteristics of the two friends and of the two romantic partners
(age, identity) and (b) about circumstances and distinctive
features of their relationships (places of meetings; answers to
the question: "What, in your drawings, shows the difference
between friendships and romance?").
Procedure
Data were collected individually by a research assistant in a
quiet schoolroom. She explained to each participant that she
needed help to understand better various ideas about chil-
dren's romantic relationships and friendship. After receiving
the child's consent to discuss these topics, she gave the par-
ticipant a pencil, 12 crayons, an eraser, and two white sheets
Cannoni and Bombi 5
(8.5 × 11) asking him or her to draw "two children who are
friends demonstrating what it means to be friends" (FD) and
then "two children who are `engaged' demonstrating what it
means to have a romantic relationship" (RD); the task order
was reversed for half of the sample. At the end of the two
drawings, the child was interviewed as described above.
Data classifying.To ensure the comparability of friendship
and romance, the same scales and categories were used to
score the two drawings (FD and RD) and the interview con-
tents pertaining to friendship (Friendship Interview, FI) and
romance (Romantic Interview, RI).
Drawings. In each drawing, the apparent age of each figure
was coded child = 1 and adult = 2, and the apparent gender,
male = 1, female = 2.
Three scales of PAIR (Bombi et al., 2007) were then
applied.
The Scale of Value was used to verify if the two charac-
ters in each drawing (FD and RD) were pictorially equivalent
or not. This scale provides a score from 0 to 10 for each fig-
ure, according to its dimensions, position in the page, body
details, attributes (i.e., clothing and held objects) and colors;
the difference between the figures' scores indicates the
degree of dyad value disparity; this difference also allows
determining which figure is more valued of the two, or the
dyad parity, where dyad refers to the pair of figures taken as
a unit.
Other two PAIR scales were used to evaluate the close-
ness of the characters' relationship. The Scale of Cohesion
measures the interdependence between the partners, and pro-
vides a score from 0 to 6 to the dyad, according to the pres-
ence of six types of pictorial cues: looking, approaching,
acting together, being near to each other, sharing a common
location, touching each other, or being connected by an
object. The Scale of Distancing measures the autonomy of
the partners, and provides a score from 0 to 6 to the dyad,
according to the presence of six types of pictorial cues:
avoiding to look at the other, moving away, acting indepen-
dently from the other, being far, staying in a specific space
(not shared with the other), being separated by something.
The drawings were scored by two trained judges, blind to
the research aims, following the guidelines reported by
Bombi et al. (2007). The scores assigned by the two judges
were highly correlated (Pearson's r = .86, p < .001, for Value;
r = .88, p < .001, for Cohesion; r = .91, p < .001 for
Distancing). For the final score assignment, where the judges
differed, a discussion followed until full agreement was
reached.
Interviews.All the interviews were literally transcribed. An
inspection of two protocols per age allowed us to detect the
following interview contents about friendship (FI) and
romance (RI): characters' age, dyad identity, place of meet-
ings, and relationship features. The information about this
last content was provided in response to our request to
explain the distinctive features of the drawings, but children
elaborated their answers in such a way that drawings
appeared merely the occasion for them to present their ideas
about the difference between friendship and romance.
The characters age, both for FI and RI, received a con-
tinuous score in years.
The dyad identity, both for FI and RI, was classified in
five mutually exclusive categories, ordered by increasing
reality and psychological proximity to the subject: 1 = two
imaginary children ("children I invented"); 2 = real generic
children ("two real boys/girls"; "Maria and Walter"); 3 =
acquaintances ("two classmates," "my neighbors"); 4 = indi-
viduals closely related to the subject ("two of my friends");
5 = a dyad including the subject ("me and my best friend";
"my girlfriend and I").
The place of meetings, both for FI and RI, was classified
in five mutually exclusive categories: 0 = do not know, 1 =
school, 2 = home, 3 = outdoors (park, street, etc.), and 4 =
public places (fast food, swimming pool, supermarket, etc.).
For the relationship features, both FI and RI received five
scores from 0 to 2 for the presence of each of five features,
non-mutually exclusive: 1 = location, 2 = degree of intimacy,
3 = type of activity, 4 = personal characteristics, and 5 =
attributed emotions.
Moreover, in each of these five scores two mutually
exclusive subcodes could be identified, as indicated by let-
ters: (1) location could be either 1a = proximity ("to be in the
same place") or 1b = privacy ("to be alone together"); (2)
degree of intimacy could be either 2a = contact ("to hold
hands") or 2b = intimate contact ("to kiss"); (3) type of activ-
ity could be either 3a = generic or friendly activity ("to play")
or 3b = romantic activity ("to receive a Valentine"); (4) per-
sonal characteristics could be either 4a = friendly character-
istics ("to resemble each other") or 4b = romantic
characteristics ("to look attractive"); (5) attributed emotions
could be either 5a = relational emotions ("to be happy") or
5b = romantic emotions ("to be in love"). Scores of two new
categories (friendly accent and romantic accent) were then
obtained by summing the frequency of all the (a) subcodes
and (b) subcodes, both for FI and RI.
The categories and scores were assigned by the first
author; the few ambiguous answers were analyzed jointly
with the second author and the category or subcode was
assigned after reaching an inter-judge agreement.
Data analyses.The Statistical Package for the Social Sci-
ences (SPSS 20.0) was used for all the statistical tests.
When a parametric test was applicable (drawing scores of
Value Disparity, Cohesion and Distancing, characters age,
scores of the five relationship features, scores of friendly and
romantic accent), we compared the scores (in FD and RD, or
in FI and RI) with variance analyses for repeated measures,
with age or sex as independent variables; Duncan's test or
Student's T for paired samples were used for the post hoc
6 SAGE Open
comparisons. When appropriate, Pearson's r was used as a
correlation index. The 2 was used for the comparisons by
age and sex of the remaining interviews contents (dyads
identity and place of meetings) and for the frequencies of
valorization of each figure in the two drawings.
Results
Personal Characteristics of Friends and Romantic
Partners
Age of partners. All the participants fulfilled the task require-
ments, depicting two children in each drawing. When asked
to attribute an age to the romantic partners, 69 children were
not able to answer, and some (n = 12) were discarded because
they attributed an adult age to one or both figures, even if the
drawing--according to the task--represented two children;
for the remaining 189 children, the ages of the two romantic
partners were highly correlated, r = .91, p < .001. The 227
children who provided valid data for friends assigned also in
this case similar ages to the two drawn characters, r = .89,
p < .001. Romantic partners are same age in 61% of the
cases, or differ by 1 year (29%); differences of 2 or more
years are 10%. Friends are same age in 64% of the cases, or
differ by 1 year (27%); differences of 2 or more years are
9%. Based on this similarity, we then computed the mean
ages of romantic partners, on one hand, and of friends, on the
other hand. The variance analysis for repeated measures on
these ages (valid cases, N = 181) yielded only two main
effects: type of dyad (romantic partners = 8.5 years; friends
= 8.2 years), Fisher's F(1, 169) = 7.17, p < .01, and partici-
pants age (M dyads age in years: 5 years = 5.7; 6 years: 7.5;
7 years: 7.4; 8 years: 8.8; 9 years: 9.6; 10 years: 10.5), Fish-
er's F(5, 169) = 72.97, p < .001. The post hoc comparisons
showed that the average age of the drawn dyads increased
regularly from one age group to the next, with the exception
of the 7-year-olds who did not differ from the 6-year-olds.
Gender of partners. All the RD included figures of the oppo-
site sex; the dyads of the FD, instead, were mainly same-
gender, and more often composed of two boys (two boys =
46%; two girls = 30%; a boy and a girl = 24%), 2(2) = 21.67,
p < .001. There were no age differences in these choices,
2(10) = 10.82, p = .367. The participants' sex, instead, had a
significant influence, 2(2) = 151.28, p < .001; in fact, 83%
of the boys depicted two male friends, while only 55% of the
girls depicted two female friends; friendly dyads composed
of a boy and a girl appeared in 35% of the girls drawings and
in 13% of the boys drawings; 10% of the girls represented
two male friends and only 4% of the boys represented two
female friends.
Partners' value.The comparison of Value Disparity yielded
only a tendencial difference between the RD and FD, Fish-
er's F(1, 258) = 3.34, p = .069: The average disparities were
very small and only slightly larger for the romantic partners
(RD = 1.33; FD = 1.13).
In the RD, children tended to give more value to the girl-
friend, 2(2) = 6.69, p < .05, parity = 29%, boy valued = 30%,
girl valued = 41%, this tendency was independent from chil-
dren's age, 2(10) = 16.01, p = .10, and sex, 2(2) = 0.85, p =
.65. A higher value of the female partner appeared also in the
65 FD with mixed-sex dyads, 2(2) = 7.97, p < .05, parity =
22%, boy valued = 29%, girl valued = 49%; 2 by age and by
sex was not applicable here, due to the small number of
cases.
Identity of partners. The distribution of answers to the ques-
tion "Who are these two characters?" both for RD and FD is
shown in Table 1.
The frequencies of the identities attributed to romantic
partners were significantly different, 2(4) = 59.56, p < .001.
Romantic couples were mostly composed of "generic chil-
dren" (34%) to whom the interviewees attributed real exis-
tence or an appropriate name; the second most frequent
category was that of completely imaginary partners, which
we could identify as different for gender by the drawings, but
to whom the child did not provide a name or any other quali-
fication (28%). Acquaintances (classmates, neighbors) and
closely related people (typically participant's friends, and
sometimes cousins or siblings) were mentioned, respectively,
by 18% and 11% of the interviewees. Only 25 children (9%)
admitted to be one of the depicted characters, with a generic
child of the opposite sex (n = 9), a classmate (n = 9), a friend
(n = 6), and in just one case, the subject's girlfriend.
Also, the frequencies of friends' identities were signifi-
cantly different, 2(4) = 26.74, p < .001, but in this case, the
subject was very often involved (54% in total, with a class-
mate 31%, with an imaginary child 23%); dyads composed
by two generic children, two subject's acquaintances or two
subject's friends were, respectively, 17%, 15%, and 14% of
the total.
We found no age differences in the identities attributed to
friends, 2(20) = 23.58, p = .26. For romantic partners, to apply
the 2, it was necessary to collapse the frequency of two catego-
ries, "close relationship" and "subject involved," due to the small
frequency of this last category; the subsequent comparison by

age did not show significant differences, 2(15) = 16.84, p =
.33. The participants'sex yielded a tendency only for the roman-
tic dyads, 2(4) = 8.83, p = .06, because boys mentioned them-
selves as one member of the dyad twice as often as girls (boys,
n = 17; girls, n = 8); no sex differences emerged in the identity
attributed to friends, 2(4) = 4.12, p = .39.
Features of Friendship and Romantic Relationship
Closeness of the two relationships in the drawings. First of all,
we resorted to the Cohesion and Distancing scores to com-
pare the closeness of the two relationships. The variance
analysis for repeated measures (scores of Cohesion and Dis-
tancing in the RD and FD) showed that the overall number of
pictorial cues (M of Cohesion scores and Distancing scores
in the two drawings) increased with age (5 years: 1.59; 6
years: 2.53; 7 years: 2.98; 8 years: 3.06; 9 years: 3.3; 10
years: 4.67), Fisher's F(5, 258) = 11.31, p < .001. The post
hoc comparisons showed that the scores increased signifi-
cantly from 5 to 6 years and again from 9 to 10 years. The
progression, however, was not identical for Cohesion and
Distancing, yielding an interaction between age and scale,
Fisher's F(5, 258) = 9.51, p < .001: progression was quite
regular for the Cohesion scores, with significant increases
between 5 and 6 years of age and between 9 and 10 years of
age; for Distancing, instead, the only significant difference
appeared between 5 and 9 years of age, with non-significant
fluctuations in the remaining ages.
Considering the mean scores of the two drawings,
Cohesion was significantly higher than Distancing
(Cohesion = 1.99; Distancing = 0.47), Fisher's F(1, 258) =
506.58, p < .001, but there was also a significant interaction
with the type of drawing, Fisher's F(1, 258) = 20.95, p <
.001, as shown in Figure 1. Post hoc comparison showed that
Cohesion was significantly higher in the RD, while
Distancing was significantly higher in FD.
Place of meetings.Drawings were not always sufficient to
understand which places children deemed appropriate for
romantic or friendly meetings, but this issue was clarified
during the interview. Several children were unable to locate
the partners meetings (24% for the romantic couples; 19%
for friends); however, several children provided more than
one possible location. The summed frequencies (n = 278, for
friends' meetings; n = 249, for romantic meetings) were only
qualitatively compared. We found that the most frequent
place for children meetings was outdoors, for friends (37%)
and especially for the romantic partners (47%); the less com-
mon were public places, such as coffee shops or fast food
restaurants (friends = 9%; romantic partners = 11%). The
second most common location was school, both for friends
(29%) and for romantic partners (26%). Home, instead, was
indicated quite often as a place for meeting friends (25%),
but much more rarely for romantic meetings (16%). All con-
sidered, children seemed to prefer those places that offer a
certain freedom of action (gardens, parks, streets, and some-
times public places) and are not so directly supervised by
adults, such as schools and especially homes. This was true
for friendship, but was more often reported for romantic
meetings.
To estimate the possible differences by sex and age, we
applied the 2 to the children's first answers, combining the
relatively rare category "public places" to the category "out-
doors." These comparisons did not yield significant differ-
ences by sex, friends' meeting places: 2(3) = 0.16, p = .98;
romantic meeting places: 2(3) = 1.27, p = .73. Age was
clearly non-significant for friends, 2(15) = 17.04, p = .32,
and only marginally significant for romantic couples, 2(15)
= 23.68, p = .07; an analysis of residuals showed that younger
children were more often unable to locate the romantic meet-
ings than were their older peers, who in turn mentioned out-
doors/public places slightly more often.
Features of the two relationships in children's verbal
descriptions. Finally, we compared the five scores of relation-
ship features obtained in FI and RI with age as an indepen-
dent variable. This variance analysis with repeated measures
yielded three main effects: age, FI versus RI, and type of
relationship feature. The average score of the five relational
features increased with age (5 years = 1.77, 6 years = 2.33, 7
years = 2.39, 8 years = 2.80, 9 years = 2.69, 10 years = 2.85);
Fisher's F(5, 264) = 5.93, p < .001; the post hoc comparison
showed a significant jump from 5 to 6 years and a slower
progression between 6 and 10 years, resulting in a significant
difference between 6 and 10 years only. The mean score of
the five relational features resulted higher for RI (1.32) than
for FI (1.16), Fisher's F(1, 264) = 9.93, p < .01. There was a
significant difference between the five relationship features
(M of FI and RI), Fisher's F(4, 1,056) = 47.2, p < .001: In
fact, activity (.88) was mentioned more often than any other
feature, followed by emotions (.65) and proximity (.52);
these latter two were significantly more often mentioned
than location (.26), which in turn was more frequent than
personal characteristics (.17). Finally, an interaction emerged
between relationship features and the two relationships chil-
dren were talking about, Fisher's F(4, 1,056) = 37.71, p <
.001, as shown in Figure 2.
The post hoc comparisons on the data of Figure 2 showed
that degree of proximity, emotions, and location was
Figure 1. Cohesion and Distancing in the two drawings.
8 SAGE Open
significantly higher for romantic partners, while activity was
typical of friends; personal characteristics were rarely men-
tioned and were not significantly different in the two
relationships.
Avariance analysis with the same design, with sex instead
of age as independent variable, did not show main effects of
sex, but only a tendential interaction between sex and type of
relationship, Fisher's F(1, 268) = 3.83, p = .05, as shown in
Figure 3.
The post hoc comparisons on the data of Figure 3 showed
that the prevalence of information about romantic relation-
ships was found in girls only.
Friendly and romantic accent in children's verbal descriptions.Finally,
we compared the scores of the friendly and romantic accent in
the FI and RI with a variance analysis for repeated measures
with two age groups (young = 5-7 years; old = 8-10 years) as
the independent variable. The low frequencies of romantic sub-
categories attributed to friendship made not possible to com-
pare six age groups. Age, type of relationship, and type of
accent yielded three main effects strictly corresponding to
those presented above in the paragraph about the relational fea-
tures: 1) young = 2.16; old = 2.78, Fisher's F(1, 268) = 20.43,
p < .001; 2) romance = 1.32; friendship = 1.16; Fisher's F(1,
268) = 111.85, p < .001; 3) romantic accent = .65; friendly
accent = 1.84; Fisher's F(1, 268) = 9.77, p < .01. More interest-
ingly, two interactions emerged: type of accent by relationship,
Fisher's F(1, 268) = 207.25, p < .001, illustrated in Figure 4,
and type of accent by relationship by age, Fisher's F(1, 268) =
11.32, p = .001, illustrated in Figure 5.
All the means of Figure 4 are significantly different from
each other, but it is evident that romantic relationship admits
the basic relational properties of friendship, although friend-
ship is definitely not romantic. In fact, a closer look at the
subcodes in each relational feature reveals that the kind of
location was never "private" for friends, as happens for
romantic partners; in addition to their closer contact, three
quarters of the activities and emotions attributed to the boy-
friend­girlfriend dyad were "romantic," while this happened
only rarely for friends.
Figure 5 shows that older children differ from younger
only in the quantity of use of the appropriate accent, both for
romance and for friendship; instead, the inappropriate use of
romantic accent to describe friendship is significantly lower
than any other score at both ages. A variance analysis with
the same design, with sex instead of two age groups as inde-
pendent variable, did not show main effects of sex, but only
a tendential interaction between sex and type of relationship,
Fisher's F(1, 268) = 3.83, p = .05, which is in fact the same
already shown in Figure 3.
Discussion
The data presented above demonstrate that 5- to 11-year-olds
do not confuse romantic engagement with friendship, lend-
ing support to the findings by Connolly et al. (1999) possibly
because their study also used a contrastive procedure, which
tends to emphasize differences. However, the open-ended
verbal questions and the non-leading pictorial task allowed
children also to show similarities when they deemed it appro-
priate: in fact, differentiation was evident in the features
attributed to each relationship, but much less evident in the
partners' characteristics.
Our hypothesis that friends would be more similar to each
other than romantic partners did not receive a strong support,
besides the fact that RDs always included a boy and a girl
(but 25% of the FDs did so as well). The partners' ages were
as highly correlated for romance as for friendship, and the
Value Disparity was only tendentially higher for romantic
partners. Moreover, the fact that this disparity was due to a
higher valorization of the female figure with respect to the
male figure, and that this happened also in those FDs includ-
ing a boy and a girl, make it unlikely that the tendential Value
Disparity should be attributed to the romantic relationship
per se. It may be that children's romance still shares more
"friendly" functions than adolescents' and adult's romance
and has not yet come to the complementarity that is implicit
in mature sexual roles.
We expected that the identity attributed to the depicted
friends and romantic partners would help us to detect the
degree of direct participant involvement in each of these two
relationships. Our hypothesis that children's ideas would not
be the reflection of direct romantic experiences gains support
from the fact that participants had more difficulty in attribut-
ing a precise age and identity to romantic partners, as com-
pared with friends. Romance is attributed to imaginary
children more often than friendship, and above all, very

romance.

rarely includes the self, which is often represented in the
FDs. Nevertheless, romantic relationships seem to be part of
children's culture, not only because of the ease with which
the participants in this study accepted and completed the task
of portraying them, but also because the romantic partners
they describe are typically children of their same age. This is
reflected in the characteristics of the boyfriend­girlfriend
drawings even though the participants do not explicitly iden-
tify themselves with these drawings.
The hypothesis that friendship would be presented as an
affiliative and companionate bond, less intimate and emo-
tional than romance has been confirmed by several results. In
the drawings, friends are portrayed with less Cohesion and
more Distancing than boyfriend­girlfriend dyads, that is,
with less indices of partner connection and more cues of inde-
pendence. In the interviews, friendship was characterized
above all by shared activities, while emotions, physical prox-
imity, and search for privacy were much more typical of
romantic dyads, which children also described as meeting
away from adult supervision more often than friends. These
results are coherent with the notion that "passionate love" is
understood by young children (Brechet, 2015; Hatfield et al.,
1988) and possibly part of their direct experience, even if the
slightly older mean age attributed to romantic couples might
be interpreted as an indication that romance is somehow more
adult than friendship. The more detailed information obtained
by comparing the impact of romantic or friendly accent in
children's descriptions of the two relationships showed that
even if romantic partners share relational activities and emo-
tions, friends are almost never portrayed as involved in
romantic situations. This latter result confirms the notion that
friendship allows a large variety of shared activities, with the
exclusion of those carrying a sexual meaning, while a roman-
tic relationship does not exclude more ubiquitous relational
features (Carlson, 2006), and is in agreement also with older
children's description (Connolly et al., 1999).
In terms of developmental differences, we hypothesized
that young children's representations would be less detailed
than that of older children. In fact, cues of Cohesion and
Distancing increase with age, as well as the amount of ver-
bal information; however, it is worth noting that even the
simpler drawings and descriptions of our younger partici-
pants were sufficient to distinguish between romance and
friendship.

Finally, our expectation of gender differences received
some support. Girls provided more information than boys
about romance, but were less likely than boys to present
themselves in a romantic role. In other words, girls appeared
more interested in (perhaps more competent about) romance
than boys, but shyer or more defensive about their own
involvement in this type of relationship. This result is coher-
ent with the function of children's romance in their acquisi-
tion of sex roles as portrayed by the above mentioned
sociological studies (Renold, 2003, 2006; Thorne and Luria,
1986). The fact that girls depicted fairly often a boy­girl
friendship is another gender difference, but which is not easy
to interpret. Girls, in general, are more diligent in their draw-
ing tasks (Lange-Küttner, 2011), and it is possible that some
of them have interpreted the requirement of comparing
romance and friendship as comparing romance and "boy-girl
friendship," in this way, imposing on themselves a more dif-
ficult task. Finally, the pictorial valorization of the female
figure in the drawings including mixed dyads was not differ-
ent in boys and girls, and may be the effect of the pictorial
process itself: Characterizing a figure as feminine often
implies adding facial details such as evidencing eyelashes or
reddened cheeks or more elaborated clothes (Cox, 1993).
Conclusion
We can conclude, then, that this study addresses a phenom-
enon which has received up to now little or no attention in
developmental psychology, even if the first hints of its pos-
sible relevance date back almost three decades (Hatfield
et al., 1988). Studies focusing on older children (Carlson &
Rose, 2007; Connolly et al., 1999) have stressed the rele-
vance of cross-gender relationships before adolescence as a
terrain for experiences that prepare children for subsequent
romantic encounters. It is then noteworthy that even younger
children are attentive to and develop ideas about romantic
relationships, even if their direct involvement remains
questionable.
We believe that drawing has been especially useful to
explore young children's ideas of romantic relationships as
compared with friendship, not only for what we gathered
from the pictorial representations per se but also for the ver-
bal information that emerged through comments about their
drawings.
This study has several limitations. First, it is only a
descriptive report, which could have been better understood
if we had had access to more information about the partici-
pants, especially about the source of their ideas. To answer
this question, future research should identify children who
have (or who have had in the past) some personal romantic
experience, information that could be obtained either through
peer nomination as in Connolly et al. (1999) or with the help
of parents and teachers, before collecting drawings and inter-
views. Information about children's exposure to romantic
models, especially via TV programs (Valkenburg & Janssen,
1999; Ward, 1995), could be of help in interpreting the data.
Second, direct observation of children's behavior in groups,
as well as indirect information through parents and teachers,
is still needed to complement the children's reports. Multi-
informant studies should be included in the future agenda.
