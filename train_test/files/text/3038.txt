BULLYING AMONG SCHOOL-AGED
youth is increasingly being rec-
ognized as an important prob-
lem affecting well-being and so-
cial functioning. While a certain amount
of conflict and harassment is typical of
youth peer relations, bullying presents
a potentially more serious threat to
healthy youth development. The defini-
tion of bullying is widely agreed on in
literatureonbullying.1-4 Bullyingisaspe-
cific type of aggression in which (1) the
behavior is intended to harm or dis-
turb, (2) the behavior occurs repeat-
edly over time, and (3) there is an im-
balance of power, with a more powerful
person or group attacking a less power-
ful one. This asymmetry of power may
be physical or psychological, and the ag-
gressive behavior may be verbal (eg,
name-calling, threats), physical (eg, hit-
ting), or psychological (eg, rumors,
shunning/exclusion).
The majority of research on bully-
ing has been conducted in Europe and
Australia. Considerable variability
among countries in the prevalence of
bullying has been reported. In an in-
ternational survey of adolescent health-
related behaviors, the percentage of stu-
dents who reported being bullied at
least once during the current term
ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in
some countries to a high of 70% in oth-
ers.5,6 Of particular concern is fre-
quent bullying, typically defined as bul-
lying that occurs once a week or more.
The prevalence of frequent bullying re-
ported internationally ranges from a low
of 1.9% among 1 Irish sample to a high
of 19% in a Malta study.1,7-12
Bullying takes many forms, and find-
ings about the types of bullying that oc-
cur are fairly similar across countries. A
British study involving 23 schools found
that direct verbal aggression was the
most common form of bullying, occur-
ring with similar frequency in both
sexes.13 Direct physical aggression was
more common among boys, while in-
direct forms were more common among
girls. Similarly, in a study of several
middle schools in Rome, the most com-
mon types of bullying reported by boys
were threats, physical harm, rejection,
and name-calling.14 The most common
forms for girls were name-calling, teas-
ing,rumors,rejection,andtakingofper-
sonal belongings.

Context Although violence among US youth is a current major concern, bullying is
infrequently addressed and no national data on the prevalence of bullying are available.
Objectives To measure the prevalence of bullying behaviors among US youth and
to determine the association of bullying and being bullied with indicators of psycho-
social adjustment, including problem behavior, school adjustment, social/emotional
adjustment, and parenting.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from a representative sample
of 15686 students in grades 6 through 10 in public and private schools throughout
the United States who completed the World Health Organization's Health Behaviour
in School-aged Children survey during the spring of 1998.
Main Outcome Measure Self-report of involvement in bullying and being bullied
by others.
Results A total of 29.9% of the sample reported moderate or frequent involvement
in bullying, as a bully (13.0%), one who was bullied (10.6%), or both (6.3%). Males
were more likely than females to be both perpetrators and targets of bullying. The
frequency of bullying was higher among 6th- through 8th-grade students than among
9th- and 10th-grade students. Perpetrating and experiencing bullying were associ-
ated with poorer psychosocial adjustment (P.001); however, different patterns of
association occurred among bullies, those bullied, and those who both bullied others
and were bullied themselves.
Conclusions The prevalence of bullying among US youth is substantial. Given the
concurrent behavioral and emotional difficulties associated with bullying, as well as
the potential long-term negative outcomes for these youth, the issue of bullying mer-
its serious attention, both for future research and preventive intervention.

Research examining characteristics of
youth involved in bullying has consis-
tently found that both bullies and those
bullied demonstrate poorer psycho-
social functioning than their nonin-
volved peers. Youth who bully others
tendtodemonstratehigherlevelsofcon-
duct problems and dislike of school,
whereas youth who are bullied gener-
ally show higher levels of insecurity,
anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhap-
piness, physical and mental symptoms,
and low self-esteem.1-4,8,15-25 Males who
are bullied also tend to be physically
weaker than males in general.2 The few
studies that have examined the charac-
teristics of youth who both bully and are
bullied found that these individuals ex-
hibit the poorest psychosocial function-
ing overall.15,17,19,26
Thecurrentresearchprovidesafoun-
dation for an understanding of the bul-
lying problem. However, it is insuffi-
cient to guide intervention and policy
development. Moreover,little is known
specifically about bullying among US
youth.6 In one county-wide middle
school survey, 24.1% of youth reported
bullying others at least once in the past
semester26; it is not known whether this
ischaracteristicof the rest of the nation.
The purpose of this study was to re-
port the prevalence of bullying in a na-
tionally representative sample of US
youth in grades 6 through 10, along
with information on differences in the
prevalence of bullying by sex, grade,
and race. In addition, the relation-
ships among bullying, being bullied,
and psychosocial adjustment are ex-
plored for 3 distinct groups: bullies
only, those bullied only, and those who
both bully and are bullied.
METHODS
Study Population
The National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development supported a
nationally representative survey of US
youth in grades 6 through 10 during
spring of 1998. The survey, entitled the
Health Behaviour of School-aged Chil-
dren (HBSC), was part of a collabora-
tive, cross-national research project in-
volving 30 countries and coordinated
by the World Health Organization.27
The US survey was approved by the Na-
tional Institute of Child Health and Hu-
man Development Institutional Re-
view Board and was carried out by
Macro International Inc (Calverton,
Md). Both parental and student con-
sent were solicited.
The US sampling universe con-
sisted of all public, Catholic, and other
private school students in grades 6
through 10, or their equivalent, exclud-
ing schools with enrollment of fewer
than 14 students. The sample design
used a stratified 2-stage cluster of
classes. The sample selection was strati-
fied by racial/ethnic status to provide
an oversample of black and Hispanic
students. The sample was also strati-
fied by geographic region and coun-
ties' metropolitan statistical area sta-
tus (largest urban areas/not largest
urban areas) with probability propor-
tional to total enrollment in eligible
grades of the primary sampling units.
Sample size was determined on the cri-
teria of making estimates for all US stu-
dents in grades 6 through 10 with a pre-
cision of 3% at a 95% confidence level,
and for minority students with a pre-
cision of 5% at a 95% confidence level.
An 83% participation rate was
achieved. The school-based sample
design, using 1 class period for comple-
tion of the questionnaire, precluded
ability to compare respondent charac-
teristics with those of nonpartici-
pants. Responding students in sampled
classes were excluded if they were out
of the target range for grade or if age
was outside of the 99th percentile for
grade (n=440 students), or if either
grade or age were unknown (n=39 stu-
dents), yielding an analytic sample of
15686 students.
Measures
Measures were obtained from a self-
report questionnaire containing 102
questions about health behavior and rel-
evant demographic variables. Items
were based on both theoretical hypoth-
eses related to the social context of ado-
lescents and measurements that had
been validated in other studies or pre-
vious WHO-HBSC surveys.27 Mea-
sures were pretested.
Bullying. Questions about bullying
were preceded with the following ex-
planation.10,28 Here are some questions
about bullying. We say a student is
BEING BULLIED when another student,
or a group of students, say or do nasty and
unpleasant things to him or her. It is also
bullying when a student is teased repeat-
edly in a way he or she doesn't like. But it
is NOT BULLYING when two students of
about the same strength quarrel or fight.
Participation in bullying was as-
sessed by 2 parallel questions that asked
respondentstoreportthefrequencywith
which they bullied others in school and
away from school during the current
term. Similarly, being bullied was as-
sessed by 2 parallel questions asking re-
spondents to report the frequency with
which they were bullied in school and
away from school during the current
term. Because the analytic focus of the
currentstudywastherelationshipofbul-
lying behaviors to overall psychosocial
adjustment, frequencies of bullying be-
haviors in and out of school were com-
bined for all analyses. Response catego-
rieswere"Ihaven't. . . ,""onceortwice,"
"sometimes," "about once a week," and
"several times a week." An analysis of
the response distribution revealed fewer
subjects in the fourth category than the
fifth, a deviation from the expected
skewed pattern. Hence, the latter 2 re-
sponse options were collapsed. Addi-
tionalquestionsaskedrespondentstore-
portthefrequencywithwhichtheywere
bullied in each of 5 ways--belittled
aboutreligion/race,belittledaboutlooks/
speech, hit/slapped/pushed, subject of
rumors or lies, and subject of sexual
comments/gestures.
Psychosocial Adjustment. Mea-
sures of psychosocial adjustment in-
cluded questions about problem be-
haviors, social/emotional well-being,
and parental influences. Alcohol use
was measured by 3 items assessing fre-
quency of alcohol consumption. The
frequency of smoking, fighting, and tru-
ancy were assessed by 1 item each. Aca-
demic achievement was assessed by an
item querying perceived school perfor-

mance. Three items (=.70) queried
the frequency of feeling lonely, feeling
left out, and being alone because oth-
ers at school did not want to spend time
with the person. One item assessed ease
of making friends. Three items (=.72)
were used to assess relationship with
classmates: "enjoy being together," "are
kind and helpful," and "accept me."
School climate was measured by 7 items
(=.82) related to the respondent's per-
ception of the school and teachers.
Three items measured parental involve-
ment in school (=.82), and 1 item as-
sessed respondents' perceptions about
their parents' attitudes toward teen
drinking.
Statistical Methods
Statistical sample weights were devel-
oped to adjust the minority oversam-
pling and to obtain student totals by
grade comparable to population grade
estimates from the US National Center
for Education Statistics. Weighted data
analyseswereconductedusingSUDAAN
software.29 Descriptive statistics were
conductedusingSUDAANtoobtainper-
centage distributions and confidence in-
tervals(CIs)basedontheweighteddata,
with SEs adjusted for the sample de-
sign. All CIs are shown at the 95% level.
To examine the relationship be-
tween psychosocial adjustment and bul-
lying/being bullied, students were clas-
sified as noninvolved, bullies only, those
bullied only, or both bully and bullied
coincidentally,andaseparatemodelwas
fit for each outcome. Students who were
neither bullies nor bullied served as the
referencegroup.Eachoutcomehad4or-
dinal levels based on frequency of the
behavior--never, once or twice, some-
times, and once a week or more. The
proportional odds model30 was used to
examine the relationship between a
range of psychosocial adjustment con-
structs and each of the outcomes. In-
herent in this model is the propor-
tional odds assumption, which states
that the cumulative odds ratio for any
2 values of the covariate is constant
across response categories. Its interpre-
tation is that the odds of being in cat-
egoryisexp[(x1
-x2
)]timeshigher
atthecovariatevectorx=x1
thanatx=x2
,
where the parameter vector  contains
the regression coefficients for the co-
variate x. A cumulative logit function
was used to estimate the model param-
etersviathegeneralizedestimatingequa-
tions.31 The dependence of responses
withinclusterswasspecifiedusinganex-
changable working correlation struc-
ture. To account for the dependence be-
tween outcomes in estimating the
variances,robustvarianceestimateswere
used for the estimated parameters. The
MULTILOGprocedureofSUDAANwas
used to fit the proportional odds model
with exchangable correlation struc-
ture. Each model was first fit using the
full sample, and then refit using 4 sub-
samples stratified by sex and education
level (middle school vs high school).
RESULTS
Prevalence of Bullying
Overall, 10.6% of the sample reported
bullying others "sometimes" (moder-
ate bullying) and 8.8% admitted to bul-
lying others once a week or more (fre-
quent bullying), providing a national
estimate of 2027254 youth involved in
moderate bullying and 1681030 youth
in frequent bullying (TABLE 1). Expe-
riencing bullying was reported with
similar frequency, with 8.5% bullied
"sometimes" and 8.4% bullied once a
week or more, for a national estimate
of 1634095 students bullied with mod-
erate frequency and 1611809 bullied
frequently (TABLE 2). A sizable num-
ber of students reported both bullying
others and being bullied themselves. Of
the total sample, 29.9% (an estimated
5736417 youth) reported some type of
involvement in moderate or frequent
bullying, as a bully (13.0%), a target of
bullying (10.6%), or both (6.3%).
Demographic variation in the fre-
quency of bullying was observed. Males
both bullied others and were bullied sig-
nificantly more often than females. Bul-
lying occurred most frequently in 6th
through 8th grade. Hispanic youth re-
portedmarginallyhigherinvolvementin
moderate and frequent bullying of oth-
ers, whereas black youth reported be-
ing bullied with significantly less fre-
quencyoverall.Nosignificantdifferences

lied through belittling one's looks or
speech was common for both sexes.
Males reported being bullied by being
hit, slapped, or pushed more fre-
quently than did females. Females more
frequently reported being bullied
through rumors or sexual comments.
Being bullied through negative state-
ments about one's religion or race oc-
curred with the lowest frequency for
both sexes.
Results of the analyses of the relation-
ship among indicators of psychosocial
adjustment and bullying/being bullied
using the proportional odds model are
presented in TABLE 4. The overall model
for each of the outcomes was signifi-
cant (P.001). Allmain effects were sig-
nificant in at least 1 of the models. Table
4 also shows the estimated odds ratios
for each psychosocial adjustment con-
struct in the model (adjusting for all
other constructs in the model), indicat-
ing the odds of having a greater fre-
quency of the outcome variable com-
pared with the reference group.
Bullies, those bullied, and individu-
als reporting both bullying and being
bullied all demonstrated poorer psycho-
social adjustment than noninvolved
youth; however, differences in the pat-
ternofmaladjustmentamongthegroups
were observed. Fighting was positively
associated with all 3 outcomes. Alco-
hol use was positively associated with
bullying and negatively associated with
being bullied. Smoking and poorer aca-
demicachievementwereassociatedwith
both bullying and coincident bullying/
being bullied; poorer perceived school
climate was related only to bullying.
Poorerrelationshipswithclassmatesand
increased loneliness, on the other hand,
were associated with both being bul-
lied and coincident bullying/being bul-
lied. Ability to make friends was nega-
tively related to being bullied and
positively related to bullying. A permis-
sive parental attitude toward teen drink-
ing was associated only with coinci-
dent bullying/being bullied, while
increasedparentalinvolvementinschool
was related to both being bullied and co-
incident bullying/being bullied.
Results from the analyses of the 4 sex/
age subgroups (data not shown) yielded
findings similar to the model based on
the full sample. No notable differences
among groups were observed for fight-
ing, academic achievement, perceived
school climate, and relationship with
classmates. However, differences by sex
and age were observed for several vari-
ables. While smoking was positively as-
sociated with bullying and coincident
bullying/beingbulliedamongallgroups,
the magnitude of the relationship was
greater for middle school youth than
high school youth. Middle school males
also showed a positive relationship be-
tween loneliness and bullying; this was
not the case for any of the other groups.
Among high school youth, bullying/
being bullied was positively related to
alcohol consumption; this relationship
was not observed among middle school
youth.Highschoolfemales,ontheother
hand, did not demonstrate a signifi-
cantrelationshipbetweenpoorerfriend-
ship-making and being bullied, whereas
the other groups did. In addition, per-
missive parental attitude toward teen
drinking was associated with bullying/
being bullied for all groups except high
school females. Finally, greater paren-

tal involvement in school was related to
being bullied and bullying/being bul-
lied for males (both middle and high
school) but not females. It was related
to bullying for high school males only.
COMMENT
This study indicates that bullying is a se-
rious problem for US youth. Consis-
tent with previous studies,1,7,8,11,12 bul-
lying was reported as more prevalent
among males than females and oc-
curred with greater frequency among
middle schoolÂ­aged youth than high
schoolÂ­aged youth. For males, both
physical and verbal bullying were com-
mon, while for females, verbal bullying
(both taunting and sexual comments)
and rumors were more common. How-
ever, verbal bullying through deroga-
tory statements about one's religion or
race occurred infrequently for both
sexes. This finding may reflect stron-
ger social norms among adolescents
against such behavior. That is, it may be
more socially acceptable for a youth to
taunt peers about their appearance than
to make derogatory racial statements.
Both bullying and being bullied were
associated with poorer psychosocial ad-
justment; however, there were notable
differences among those bullied, bul-
lies, and those reporting both behav-
iors. Those bullied demonstrated poorer
social and emotional adjustment, re-
portinggreaterdifficultymakingfriends,
poorer relationships with classmates,
and greater loneliness. Youth who are
socially isolated and lack social skills
may be more likely targets for being bul-
lied. This is consonant with the finding
by Hoover and colleagues32,33 that the
most frequent reason cited by youth for
persons being bullied is that they "didn't
fit in." At the same time, youth who are
bullied may well be avoided by other
youth, for fear of being bullied them-
selves or losing social status among their
peers.Consideringthehighdegreeofre-
lationship observed, it is likely that both
processes occur. Being bullied was also
associated with greater parental involve-
ment in school, which may reflect par-
ents' awareness of their child's difficul-
ties. Conversely, parental involvement

BULLYING BEHAVIORS AMONG US YOUTH

may be related to a lower level of inde-
pendence among these youth, poten-
tially making them more vulnerable to
being bullied. Interestingly, being bul-
lied was associated with less frequency
of alcohol use and had a nonlinear re-
lationship with smoking. This is not al-
together surprising, given Farring-
ton's34,35 findingthatsociallyineptyouth
were less likely to be involved in delin-
quency than other youth.
Persons who bullied others were
more likely to be involved in other
problem behaviors such as drinking al-
cohol and smoking. They showed
poorer school adjustment, both in terms
of academic achievement and per-
ceived school climate. Yet they re-
ported greater ease of making friends,
indicating that bullies are not socially
isolated. Considering their greater in-
volvement in other problem behav-
iors, it is likely that these youth have
friends who endorse bullying and other
problem behaviors, and who may be in-
volved in bullying as well.
Those youth who reported both bul-
lying and being bullied demonstrated
poorer adjustment across both social/
emotional dimensions and problem be-
haviors.Consideringthecombinationof
socialisolation,lackofsuccessinschool,
and involvement in problem behaviors,
youthwhobothbullyothersandarebul-
lied may represent an especially high-
riskgroup.Itisnotknownwhetherthese
youth were first bullied and then imi-
tated the bullying behavior they experi-
enced or whether they were bullies who
then received retaliation. Current un-
derstanding tends to support the former
explanation. Olweus2 describes a small
subset of bullied youth he terms "pro-
vocative victims," individuals who dem-
onstrate both anxious and aggressive
behavior patterns and who are known
for starting fights and engaging in dis-
ruptive behavior. Pellegrini and col-
leagues36,37 further discuss the "aggres-
sive victim," defined as youth who
respondtobullyingwithreactiveaggres-
sion. These youth do not tend to use ag-
gression in a proactive or instrumental
manner, but rather are aggressive in re-
taliatory circumstances.
The patterns of relationships be-
tween bullying/being bullied and psy-
chosocial adjustment observed in this
study were similar across age and sex
groups, providing support for the sta-
bilityofthefindings.Thedifferencesthat
emerged may be useful for those con-
ductingresearchordevelopinginterven-
tions targeting specific populations. For
example, the stronger relationship be-
tween bullying and smoking observed
among middle school youth may re-
flect an association of bullying with de-
viance; as smoking becomes more nor-
mative in the older youth, it is less
associated with bullying. The lack of a
relationship between being bullied and
poorer friendship-making among high
schoolfemalescouldindicatethatbythis
age, females are more apt to find a peer
group in which they "fit," even though
the peer group may consist of youth of
similar social status.38
Severallimitationsofthestudyshould
be noted. The HBSC is a broadly fo-
cused survey regarding the health be-
haviors of middleÂ­ and high schoolÂ­
aged youth. As such, more in-depth
information, such as might be obtained
from an intervention study addressing
bullying,arenotavailable.Thisstudyin-
cludes middleÂ­ and high schoolÂ­aged
youth but does not address elementary
school youth. The data are cross-
sectional, and as such, the direction of
relationships among the variables can-
not be determined. Another limitation is
the reliance on self-report for measure-
ment of bullying. While self-report is a
common and accepted method of mea-
suring bullying, individual perceptions
of bullying nevertheless may vary. To
minimizesubjectivity,studentswerepro-
vided with a detailed definition of bul-
lying along with examples.
While research on the long-term con-
sequences of bullying is minimal, the
studies that have been conducted show
negative effects into adulthood. Ol-
weus39 found former bullies to have a
4-foldincreaseincriminalbehavioratthe
age of 24 years, with 60% of former bul-
lies having at least 1 conviction and 35%
to 40% having 3 or more convictions.
Their earlier pattern of achieving de-
sired goals through bullying likely in-
hibited the learning of more socially ac-
ceptablewaysofnegotiatingwithothers.
Conversely, individuals formerly bul-
lied were found to have higher levels of
depression and poorer self-esteem at the
age of 23 years, despite the fact that, as
adults, they were no more harassed or
socially isolated than comparison
adults.40 Those who have been bullied
mayviewsuchtreatmentasevidencethat
they are inadequate and worthless and
may internalize these perceptions. No
study has assessed the long-term out-
comes for those who both bully others
andarebullied.Giventheirinitialpoorer
adjustment status, it is possible that they
fare worse than either bullies or those
bullied.
While this study provides impor-
tant data on the prevalence and psy-
chosocial correlates of bullying among
US youth, further research is needed.

Of particular importance would be pro-
spective studies addressing factors that
lead to bullying, as well as studies on
the long-term consequences of bully-
ing and being bullied. Longitudinal
studies also would be valuable in bet-
ter understanding the nature of those
who bully and are bullied.
The prevalence of bullying observed
in this study suggests the importance of
preventive intervention research target-
ing bullying behaviors. Effective pre-
vention will require a solid understand-
ing of the social and environmental
factors that facilitate and inhibit bully-
ing and peer aggression. This knowl-
edge could then be used to create school
and social environments that promote
healthy peer interactions and intoler-
ance of bullying. School-based interven-
tions have demonstrated positive out-
comes in Norway and England,40-43 with
reductions in bullying of 30% to 50%.
These interventions focused on changes
within the school and classroom cli-
mate to increase awareness about bul-
lying, increase teacher and parent in-
volvement and supervision, form clear
rules and strong social norms against
bullying, and provide support and pro-
tection for individuals bullied. This type
of approach has not been tested in the
United States.
