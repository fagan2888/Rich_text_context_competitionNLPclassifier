AIM: To explore the relationship between self-reported weight and height to actual weight and height in a cross-
sectional nationally representative sample of young adolescents.
METHODS: Weights and heights were obtained on 1932 adolescents aged 12 ± 16 y enrolled in the NHANES III study.
Self-reported weights and heights were available on 1657 of the adolescents (86%).
RESULTS: Correlation between self-reported weight and actual weight ranged between 0.87 and 0.94, depending on
gender or race. However, self-reported weights were signi®cantly lower than measured weights among girls,
compared to boys (P ` 0.001). Correlation between self-reported height and actual height ranged from 0.82 ± 0.91.
There were no differences in the accuracy of self-reported heights among boys and girls or racial groups. Differences
between actual weight and self-reported weight were signi®cantly greater for obese children compared with non-
obese children (P ` 0.001). Nevertheless, the use of self-reported weight and height resulted in the correct classi®ca-
tion of weight status in 94% of children. As a result, small differences in self-reported weights and heights had no
impact in assessing obesity related morbidities.
CONCLUSION: In¯uences of gender and racial biases in reporting of weight and height were relatively small. Self-
reported heights and weights were extremely reliable for the predicting obesity related morbidities and behaviours.

Introduction
In national surveys of youth behaviour, self-reported
weights and heights are often utilized in place of
actual measurement. In the United States, the Youth
Risk and Behavior Surveillance Study (YRBSS),1 the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,2
and the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS)3
rely on self-reported weight and height in order to
assess the impact of body weight on adolescent self-
esteem, dieting, and overall health.
In adults, the correlation between actual and
reported heights and weights typically range between
0.96 and 0.99.3 ± 5 Brooks-Gunn et al reported correla-
tions between actual and reported heights and weights
ranging between 0.77 and 0.98 in a small group of
young adolescents from a well-educated, high-income
community.6 However, self-reports may re¯ect cul-
tural biases resulting in differing accuracies among
sexes and races. The correlation between actual and
reported heights and weights in a cross-sectional
national survey of children has not been studied.
In order to clarify the accuracy of self-reported
weight and height, data were analyzed from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(cycle III), a nationally representative sample of
children and adults between 1988 and 1994. Data
were also analyzed to determine whether self-reported
weight and height resulted in differences between
predicted risk of obesity related morbidities compared
to actual weight and height.
Methods
The National Health and Nutritional Examination
Survey, Cycle III (NHANES III) is the seventh in a
series of large national health examination surveys
conducted in the United States since the 1960s.
NHANES III examined a nationally representative
sample of children and adults between 1988 and
1994. 1932 children between the ages of 12 and 16
were studied. Measured weights and heights were
available on over 99% of the children; self-reported
weights and heights were available on 1657 children
(86%).
Body weight was determined to the nearest 0.05 kg
(Toledo 2181 Scale) and height was measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm using standardized measuring equip-
ment (Holtain Height Stadiometer). Equipment was
recalibrated between each measurement. Children

were weighed and measured in their undergarments.
Self-reported weights and heights were recorded to
the nearest pound and inch and converted to metric
measurements. Tanner pubertal staging was per-
formed by trained study staff.
Normal weight was de®ned as a body mass index
(kgam2) less than the 85th percentile for age and
gender; overweight was de®ned as a body mass
index (kgam2) greater than the 85th percentile for
age and gender, and obesity was de®ned as a body
mass index (kgam2) greater than the 95th percentile
for age and gender. Reference body mass index
percentiles were derived from the ®rst National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.7 This de®-
nition is in accordance with recommendations of the
Expert Committee on Clinical Guidelines for Over-
weight in Adolescence.8
All children underwent a standardized interview
with trained staff. Children were asked the following
questions concerning weight, height, self-perceived
weight, and weight control practices:
Ð How tall are you without shoes?
Ð How much do you weigh without clothes or
shoes?
Ð How many hours of television did you watch
yesterday?
Ð How many times each week do you exercise
enough to make yourself sweat?
Ð Have you dieted during the past year?
Ð How often do you eat breakfast?
Because the NHANES III study over-sampled blacks,
younger children, and the elderly, the data was
weighted so that all statistics re¯ected a national
representative sample of children aged 12 ± 16 years
old. Differences in continuous variables were assessed
using the independent t-test. Differences in propor-
tions were assessed using chi-square. Correlation
coef®cients were calculated using linear regression.
Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression.
In order to adjust for complex sample design and
clustering effects in the NHANES III sample, statis-
tical signi®cance was assessed using the balance
repeated replication method using the software pack-
age WesVarPC (Westat Inc., Rockville, MD) as
recommended.9
Results
936 of the children enrolled were white/Hispanic
(57%), 647 were black (38%), and 74 were
other (5%) (Table 1). Approximately 16% of young
adolescents were overweight (85th percentile ` BMI
` 95th percentile), and 11% were obese (BMI b 95th
percentile). In addition, there were no signi®cant
differences in age distribution between normal
weight (BMI ` 85th percentile), overweight and
obese children. There was a small, but signi®cantly
increased prevalence of obesity among blacks com-
pared to whites (13% vs 10%, P ` 0.05), but no
difference in the prevalence of overweight among
blacks compared to whites (27% vs 25%, P  0.4).
Self-reported weight in young adolescents was
within 2 kg of actual weight in 59% of children and
within 5 kg of actual weight in 88%. Self-reported
height was within 2 cm of actual height in 57% of
children and within 4 cm of actual height in 81%. 95%
of adolescents reported a weight within 10 kg of actual
weight, and over 95% of adolescents reported a height
within 8 cm of actual height.
On average, reported weight was approximately
0.4 kg lower than actual weight ( 7 0.4Æ 5.5 kgs)*,
and reported height was one cm lower than actual
height ( 7 1.0Æ 5.1 cms). Females were more likely
to under-report their weight than males (1.0Æ 5.5 kgs
vs 7 0.1Æ 6.1 kgs, P ` 0.001). There was no differ-
ence in the degree of under-reporting in females of
different races (P  0.4) or males of different races
(P  0.8). There was also no signi®cant difference
between under-reporting of height among males and
females (0.4Æ 2.1 vs 0.5Æ 2.1, P  0.9) or racial
groups (P  0.2) or pubertal stage (P  0.5). A small
proportion of adolescents reported completely erro-
neous weights and heights: Approximately 1% of
adolescents reported a weight over 22 kg different
from their actual weight, and 1% of adolescents
reported a height over 20 cm different than their
actual height.
Correlation between self-reported weight and actual
weight ranged between 0.87 and 0.94, depending on
gender or race (Table 2). Lower correlations were
noted in females compared to males (P ` 0.001).
There were no signi®cant differences between corre-
lations between blacks and whites (P  0.1). Correla-
tion between self-reported height and actual height
ranged from 0.82 ± 0.91. Lower correlations were also
present among females (P ` 0.001), but not racial
groups (P  0.5). Extremely poor correlations

between self-reported height and actual height were
observed in adolescents with reported heights less
than 150 centimeters (r  0.06, n  191) (Figure 1).
Correlations between body mass index as calculated
from actual weight and height compared to self-
reported weight and self-reported height ranged
between 0.79 ± 0.89. Lower correlations in body
mass index were present in females (P ` 0.01) and
blacks (P ` 0.05).
Differences between actual weight and self-
reported weight were signi®cantly greater for obese
children compared with non-obese children
(4.6Æ 7.8 kgs vs 7 0.2Æ 5.3 kgs, P ` 0.001). In fact,
self-reported weight was within 5 kg of actual weight
in 92% of the normal weight children but only 59% of
the obese children (P ` 0.001). Females were also
more likely to under-report their weight by more
than 5 kg compared to males (P ` 0.01). In addition,
there was no difference in age between those children
who under-reported or over-reported their weight by
more than 5 kg Table 3.
Since obese children weighed on average 33 kg
more than non-obese children (88Æ 23 kgs vs
55Æ 11 kgs, P ` 0.001), errors in self-reporting of
weight and height had little impact on classifying
whether an individual was obese (BMI b 95th%) or
non-obese. The use of self-reported weight and height
resulted in the correct classi®cation of obesity status
in 94% of children. Similar results were demonstrated
in both males and females (P  0.5) and among all
races (P  0.1). Consequently, odds ratios for obesity
related behaviours were similar whether obesity
(BMI b 95th percentile) was calculated using actual
weight and height or self-reported weight and height
(Figure 2).
Discussion
Correlations of self-reported and actual weights and
heights in young adolescents ranged from approxi-
mately 0.85 ± 0.95. Although correlations between
actual weights and heights and measured weights
and heights are lower in adolescents than those
reported in adults,3 ± 5 they remain extremely reliable

for predicting obesity related morbidities and beha-
viours. Since obese adolescents weighed approxi-
mately 33 kg more than the non-obese adolescents,
even moderate errors in self-reported height and
weight had minimal in¯uence on misclassi®cation of
obesity status. As a result, the odds ratios for weight
related behaviours (ie, dieting, television watching,
exercise, etc) were virtually identical whether weight
status was calculated using self-reported or actual
weights and heights.
Since self-reported weights and heights are easily
obtained, they are appropriate to utilize in surveys in
order to provide a reliable assessment of obesity
related behaviours. However, self-reported heights
and weights are not reliable for tracking weight
changes in longitudinal surveys where more precise
measurements are necessary. In addition, self-reported
heights and weights are not recommended for use in
studies of obesity related morbidities such as hyper-
tension or hypercholesterolaemia where it is clearly
more appropriate to measure anthropometrics directly.
Finally, self-reported heights and weights are not
recommended for identifying an individual as `over-
weight' since a fairly narrow height and weight range
is required for accurate classi®cation (85th percenti-
le ` BMI ` 95th percentile).
These data support the work of Epstein and collea-
gues who have also demonstrated that in children the
use of self-reported heights and weights results in the
correct classi®cation of obesity in 91% of children
aged 6 ± 12 y.10 Because children tend to under-report
both height and weight, calculations of body mass
index are less inaccurate than those obtained from
large studies in adults, where self-reported height is
over-estimated and self-reported weight is under-esti-
mated. As a result, Kuskowska-Wolk et al have
demonstrated that over 30% of adults who were
overweight by measured weight and height would be
misclassi®ed by self-reported weight and height11
compared to the 6% misclassi®cation observed in
this study.
Although the correlations between self-reported
weight and measured weight were high, there existed
signi®cant gender and racial differences in reporting.
In particular, females are likely to under-report their
weight to a greater extent than males. Similar results
have been previously described in both children and
adults. Dwyer et al showed that teenage boys report
their weight more accurately than teenage girls.12
Discrepancies in self-reported weight and actual
weight were highest in heavy girls, similar to what
was observed in the current study.13 In adults,
women's self-reported weights are found to be con-
sistently lower than their actual weights across the
weight spectrum; in contrast, only overweight men
tend to under-estimate their actual weight.14 ± 16
Gender differences in self-reported weight and
weight status may indicate a general desire to weigh
less.18 Gustafson-Larson et al 17 and Maloney et al 18
have also reported that pre-teen and adolescent girls
were almost twice as likely as similarly aged boys to
report a desire to be thinner.
There were no signi®cant differences in self-reported
heightandweightbetweenblacksandwhites,althougha
small difference in correlation between actual and
calculated BMI occurred between whites and blacks.
This is particularly surprising since signi®cant racial
differences exist in perception of weight status (for
example, `are you overweight?') between blacks and
whites. Neff and colleagues reported that white adoles-
cent girls were almost twice as likely to perceive
themselves as overweight compared to black adolescent
girls.19 Racial differences in weight status perception
have also been reported in the Youth Risk and Behavior
Surveillance Survey (YRBSS),1 the 1985 National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS),3 and the Kids'
Eating Disorders Survey (KEDS).20
In conclusion, the in¯uences of gender and racial
biases in reporting of weight and height were rela-
tively small. Biases in reporting weight and height
were much larger in obese individuals than non-obese
individuals, but remained inconsequential in a rela-
tionship with obesity related behaviours. Small differ-
ences in self-reported weight in females may be
related to a general desire to be thinner. However,
racial differences between self-reported weight and
actual weight were not observed despite previous
evidence that whites are more likely to perceive
themselves as overweight.
