Bootstrapping Autoregressions with Conditional
Heteroskedasticity of Unknown Form*
Abstract
Conditional heteroskedasticity is an important feature of many macroeconomic and
financial time series. Standard residual-based bootstrap procedures for dynamic regression
models treat the regression error as i.i.d. These procedures are invalid in the presence of
conditional heteroskedasticity. We establish the asymptotic validity of three easy-to-
implement alternative bootstrap proposals for stationary autoregressive processes with
m.d.s. errors subject to possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. These
proposals are the fixed-design wild bootstrap, the recursive-design wild bootstrap and the
pairwise bootstrap. In a simulation study all three procedures tend to be more accurate in
small samples than the conventional large-sample approximation based on robust standard
errors. In contrast, standard residual-based bootstrap methods for models with i.i.d. errors
may be very inaccurate if the i.i.d. assumption is violated. We conclude that in many
empirical applications the proposed robust bootstrap procedures should routinely replace
conventional bootstrap procedures based on the i.i.d. error assumption.
Zusammenfassung
Bedingte Heteroskedastizität ist eine wichtige Eigenschaft von vielen Daten über
Finanzmärkte und die Makroökonomie. Standard bootstrap Verfahren für dynamische
Regressionsmodelle behandeln die Residuen der Regression als i. i. d. Bei bedingter
Heteroskedastizität sind diese Prozeduren nicht angemessen. Wir zeigen die asymptotische
Gültigkeit von 3 alternativen bootstrap Methoden für stationäre autoregressive Prozesse
mit m. d. s. Fehler, die eine bedingte Heteroskedastizität unbekannter Form aufweisen. Es
geht dabei um ein fixed-design wild bootstrap, den recursive-design wild bootstrap und den
paarweisen bootstrap. In einer Simulationsstudie erscheinen alle 3 Prozeduren in kleinen
Stichproben angewandt genauer als die konventionellen Approximationen, die auf robusten
Standardfehlern basieren. Diese letztgenannten Methoden können dagegen sehr ungenau
sein, wenn die i. i. d. Annahme nicht gilt. Wir schließen daraus, dass bei vielen
empirischen Anwendungen die robusten bootstrap Verfahren, die hier vorgestellt werden
und leicht zu implementieren sind, die üblichen bootstrap Verfahren ersetzen sollten.

1. Introduction
It is well known that there is evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the residuals of many estimated
dynamic regression models in Þnance and in macroeconomics. This evidence is particularly strong for
regressions involving monthly, weekly and daily data. Standard residual-based bootstrap methods of
inference for autoregressions treat the error term as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and
are invalidated by conditional heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we analyze two main proposals for
dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form in autoregressions.
The Þrst proposal is very easy to implement and involves an application of the wild bootstrap
(WB) to the residuals of the dynamic regression model. The WB method allows for regression errors
that follow martingale difference sequences (m.d.s.) with possible conditional heteroskedasticity. We
investigate both the Þxed-design and the recursive-design implementation of the WB for autoregressions.
We prove their Þrst-order asymptotic validity for the autoregressive parameters (and smooth functions
thereof) under fairly general conditions including, for example, many stationary ARCH, GARCH and
stochastic volatility error processes.
There are several fundamental differences between this paper and earlier work on the WB in re-
gression models. First, existing theoretical work has largely focused on the classical linear regression
model (see Davidson and Flachaire 2000). Second, Davidson and Flachaire (2000) establish the validity
of the WB in the presence of unconditional heteroskedasticity in cross-sections, whereas we focus on
conditional heteroskedasticity in time series. Third, much of the earlier work has focused on boot-
strapping models restricted under the null hypothesis of a test, whereas we focus on the construction of
bootstrap conÞdence intervals from unrestricted regression models (see Davidson and Flachaire 2000,
Godfrey and Orme 2001).
The work most closely related to ours is Kreiss (1997). Kreiss established the asymptotic validity
of a Þxed-design WB for stationary autoregressions with known Þnite lag order when the error term
exhibits a speciÞc form of conditional heteroskedasticity. We provide a generalization of this result to
m.d.s. errors with possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Our results cover as special
cases the N-GARCH, t-GARCH and asymmetric GARCH models, as well as stochastic volatility models.
2
Kreiss (1997) also proposed a recursive-design WB, under the name of "modiÞed wild bootstrap", but he
did not establish the consistency of this bootstrap proposal for autoregressive processes with conditional
heteroskedasticity. We prove the Þrst-order asymptotic validity of the recursive-design WB for Þnite-
order autoregressions with m.d.s. errors subject to possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown
form. The proof holds under slightly stronger assumptions than the proof for the Þxed-design WB.
Tentative simulation evidence shows that the recursive-design WB scheme works well in small sam-
ples for a wide range of models of conditional heteroskedasticity. In contrast, conventional residual-
based resampling schemes based on the i.i.d. assumption may be very inaccurate in the presence of
conditional heteroskedasticity. Moreover, the recursive-design WB method works equally well in the
i.i.d. error case. The recursive-design WB method is typically more accurate in small samples than
the Þxed-design WB method. It also tends to be more accurate than the Gaussian large-sample
approximation based on robust standard errors.
The second proposal for dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form involves the
pairwise resampling of the observations. This method was originally suggested by Freedman (1981) for
cross-sectional models. We establish the asymptotic validity of this method in the autoregressive context
and compare its performance to that of the Þxed-design and of the recursive-design WB. The pairwise
bootstrap is less efficient than the residual-based WB, but - like the Þxed-design WB - it remains valid
for a broader range of GARCH processes than the recursive-design WB, including EGARCH, AGARCH
and GJR-GARCH processes, which have been proposed speciÞcally to capture asymmetric responses
to shocks in asset returns (see, e.g., Engle and Ng (1993) for a review). We Þnd in Monte Carlo
simulations that the pairwise bootstrap is typically more accurate than the Þxed-design WB method,
but in small samples tends to be somewhat less accurate than the recursive-design WB when the data
are persistent. For large samples these differences vanish, and the pairwise bootstrap is as accurate as
the recursive-design WB.
The theoretical and simulation results in this paper suggest that no single method of dealing with
conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form will be optimal in all cases. We conclude that the
recursive-design WB should replace conventional recursive-design i.i.d. bootstrap methods in many
3
standard applications in empirical macroeconomics. This method performs equally well, whether the
error term is i.i.d. or conditionally heteroskedastic, but it lacks a theoretical justiÞcation for some forms
of GARCH that have Þgured prominently in the literature on high-frequency returns. When sample
sizes are at least moderately large and the possibility of asymmetric forms of GARCH is a practical
concern, the pairwise bootstrap provides a suitable alternative.
A third proposal for dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form is the resampling of
blocks of autoregressive residuals (see, e.g., Berkowitz, Birgean and Kilian 2000). No formal theoretical
results exist that would justify such a bootstrap proposal. We do not consider this proposal for two
reasons. First, in the context of a well-speciÞed parametric model this proposal involves a loss of
efficiency relative to the WB because it allows for serial correlation in the error term in addition to
conditional heteroskedasticity. Second, the residual-based block bootstrap requires the choice of an
additional tuning parameter in the form of the block size. In practice, results may be sensitive to the
choice of block size. Although there are data-dependent rules for block size selection, these procedures
are very computationally intensive and little is known about their accuracy in small samples. In
contrast, the methods we propose are no more computationally burdensome than the standard residual-
based algorithm and very easy to implement.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide some empirical and theoretical motivation
for the use of the m.d.s. assumption in resampling and highlight the limitations of existing bootstrap
and asymptotic methods of inference for dynamic regression models such as autoregressions. In section
3 we describe the bootstrap algorithms and state our main theoretical results. Details of the proofs
are relegated to the appendix. In section 4, we provide some tentative simulation evidence for the
small-sample performance of alternative bootstrap proposals. We conclude in section 5.
2. Evidence Against the Assumption of i.i.d. Errors
Standard residual-based bootstrap methods of inference for dynamic regression models treat the error
term as i.i.d. The i.i.d. assumption does not follow naturally from economic models. Nevertheless, in
many cases it has proved convenient for theoretical purposes to treat the error term of dynamic regression
models as i.i.d. This would be of little concern if actual data were well represented by models with
4
i.i.d. errors. Unfortunately, this is not the case in many empirical studies. Two illustrative examples
are asset return regressions in empirical Þnance and autoregressions in empirical macroeconomics.
Dating back to work by Fama and French (1988), there has been great interest in testing the null
hypothesis of uncorrelated stock returns. It is common to use nonparametric bootstrap tests of this
hypothesis that impose the much stronger assumption of i.i.d. returns (see, e.g., Goetzmann and Jorion
1993). Figure 1a shows clear evidence of volatility clustering in monthly value-weighted CRSP returns
for 1927.1-2000.12 that invalidates that assumption. This conclusion is also supported by a formal LM
test of the null of conditional homoskedasticity in Table 1 (see Engle 1982). A related problem arises
in the international Þnance literature. The random walk hypothesis due to Meese and Rogoff (1983)
implies that changes in exchange rates should be unpredictable. It is standard to employ bootstrap
tests of this hypothesis. In actuality, however, these tests impose the much more stringent assumption
of i.i.d. returns (see Mark 1995, Kilian 1999). The evidence in Figure 1b and Table 1 (based on the
DM-U.S. dollar exchange rate for 1973.1-2001.10) suggests that this assumption is highly questionable,
at least for exchange returns at monthly or higher frequency.
An alternative approach in empirical Þnance involves the use of Þnite-sample critical values based
on Þtted VAR models for returns and a set of additional predictors. This approach may be interpreted
as a parametric bootstrap approach. Often, however, these VAR models ignore evidence of conditional
heteroskedasticity in the VAR errors (see e.g., Goetzmann and Jorion 1995). In principle, we may
modify the bootstrap approach by postulating a parametric model of conditional heteroskedasticity.
For example, Hodrick (1992) and Bekaert and Hodrick (2001) postulate a VAR model with condition-
ally Gaussian GARCH(1,1) errors. Similarly, Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) augment the return
regression by a parametric GARCH(1,1) model. This approach is unlikely to solve the problem. Even
in the unlikely case that we could agree that the class of GARCH models is appropriate for a given
data set, in practice the precise form of the GARCH model will be unknown and different speciÞcations
may yield different results (see Wolf 2000). The same holds for the class of stochastic volatility models.
This fact points to the need for a nonparametric treatment of conditional heteroskedasticity in dynamic
regression models.
5
This need is reinforced by the fact that it is exceedingly difficult to obtain reliable numerical estimates
of multivariate GARCH models. In practice, researchers often impose additional ad hoc restrictions on
the covariance structure of the model (see, e.g., Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge 1988, Bollerslev 1990,
Bekaert et. al. 1997). These restrictions have no theoretical justiÞcation (also see Ledoit, Santa-Clara
and Wolf 2001). Finally, we note that even with such restrictions it seems next to impossible to model
conditional heteroskedasticity in high-dimensional VAR models unless the sample size is very large.
This problem is most apparent in macroeconomic applications with many variables.
Whereas the failure of the i.i.d. assumption is well-documented in empirical Þnance, it is less well
known that many monthly macroeconomic variables also exhibit strong conditional heteroskedasticity.
The workhorse model of empirical macroeconomics is the linear autoregression. Figure 2 plots the
squared residuals of six univariate monthly autoregressive models (for the growth rate of industrial
output, M1 growth, CPI inßation, the real 3-month T-Bill rate, the nominal Federal Funds rate and the
percent change in the price of oil). The data source is FRED, the sample period 1959.1-2001.8, and the
lag orders of the AR models have been selected by the AIC. Figure 2 shows strong evidence of departures
from conditional homoskedasticity. Formal LM tests of the null hypothesis of no ARCH in Table 1 also
provide overwhelming evidence against the i.i.d. assumption. The evidence in Table 1 is important
because many methods of inference developed for smooth functions of autoregressive parameters (such
as impulse responses) do not allow for conditional heteroskedasticity. For example, standard residual-
based bootstrap methods for autoregressions rely on the i.i.d. error assumption and are invalid in the
presence of conditional heteroskedasticity, as we will show in the next section. Similarly, the grid
bootstrap of Hansen (1999) is based on the assumption of an autoregression with i.i.d. errors.
It may seem that standard asymptotic methods would be less restrictive, but this is not necessarily
the case. For example, the closed-form solutions for the asymptotic normal approximation proposed by
Lütkepohl (1990) also rely on the assumption of conditional homoskedasticity. They are based on least-
squares estimates of the variance of the estimator that are inconsistent in the presence of conditional
heteroskedasticity. Similarly, Wright's (2000) local-to-unity intervals for AR(p) impulse responses rely
on the assumption of i.i.d. innovations. Although these methods could presumably be modiÞed to allow
6
for conditional heteroskedasticity, current implementations of these methods are invalid in the presence
of conditional heteroskedasticity. Other papers make the even stronger assumption of Gaussian i.i.d.
errors, including Wright (2001), Andrews (1993) and Andrews and Chen (1994). Although the latter
two papers provide some simulation evidence that their method is fairly robust to non-Gaussian i.i.d.
innovations, they do not consider conditionally heteroskedastic errors. Finally, although this paper
does not cover the Bayesian approach, it should be noted that the popular Bayesian Monte Carlo
integration method for forming Bayesian error bands for VAR impulse responses also assumes that the
VAR innovations are i.i.d. (see Doan 1990, Sims and Zha 1999).
In this paper we study several easy-to-implement bootstrap methods that allow inference in autore-
gressions with possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Unlike the standard residual-
based bootstrap for models with i.i.d. innovations these bootstrap methods remain valid under the
much weaker assumption of m.d.s. innovations, and they do not require the researcher to take a stand
on the existence or speciÞc form of conditional heteroskedasticity. For expository purposes we focus on
univariate autoregressive models. Analogous results for the multivariate case are possible at the cost
of additional notation.
3. Theory
Let (, F, P) be a probability space and {Ft} a sequence of increasing -Þelds of F. The sequence of
martingale differences {t, t  Z} is deÞned on (, F, P), where each t is assumed to be measurable
with respect to Ft. We observe a sample of data {y-p+1, . . . , y0, y1, . . . , yn} from the following data
generating process for the time series yt,
 (L) yt = t, (3.1)
where  (L) = 1 - 1

where Yt-1 = (yt-1, . . . , yt-p)0. In this paper we focus on bootstrap conÞdence intervals for  that are
robust to the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form in the innovations {t}. More
speciÞcally, we assume the following condition:
Assumption A
(i) E (t|Ft-1) = 0, almost surely, where Ft-1 =  (t-1, t-2, . . .) is the -Þeld generated by {t-1, t-2, . . .} .

Assumption A replaces the usual i.i.d. assumption on the errors {t} by the broader martingale
difference sequence assumption. In particular, Assumption A does not impose conditional homoskedas-
ticity on the sequence {t}, which need not be strictly stationary (although it is covariance station-
ary). Assumption A covers a variety of conditionally heteroskedastic models such as ARCH, GARCH,
EGARCH and stochastic volatility models (see, e.g. Deo (2000), who shows that a stronger version
of Assumption A is satisÞed for stochastic volatility and GARCH models). Assumptions (iv) and (v)
restrict the fourth order cumulants of t.
The following theorem gives the asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimator ^
n
for the parameter
vector  under the martingale difference sequence Assumption A. This result could be obtained as a
special case of Kuersteiner's (2001) Theorem 3.4, which gives the asymptotic distribution of efficient
instrumental variables estimators in the context of ARMA models with martingale difference sequence
errors. In particular, in addition to the martingale difference sequence assumption, his Assumption
A1 assumes {t} to be stationary ergodic, and it imposes a summability condition on the fourth order
8
cumulants. Here, we use Assumption A, which relaxes the stationarity and ergodicity assumptions
and the summability condition. We use Kuersteiner's (2001) notation to characterize the asymptotic
covariance matrix of ^
n
. Using -1 (L) =

The validity of any bootstrap method in the context of autoregressions with conditional het-
eroskedasticity depends crucially on the ability of the bootstrap to estimate consistently the asymptotic
covariance matrix C. The standard residual-based bootstrap method fails to do so by not correctly
mimicking the behavior of the fourth order cumulants of t in the conditionally heteroskedastic case,
as we now show. Let ^

t
be resampled with replacement from the centered residuals. The standard
residual-based bootstrap builds y

implying that the limiting distribution of the recursive i.i.d. bootstrap is N

. As Theorem 3.1
above shows, 2A-1 is not the correct asymptotic covariance matrix of ^
n
without further conditions,
e.g., that t is conditionally homoskedastic. In the general conditionally heteroskedastic case, B depends
on 4i,j. The recursive i.i.d. bootstrap implies E

and thus implicitly sets i,j = 1 for i = j and 0 for i 6= j.
Given the failure of the standard-residual based bootstrap, we are interested in establishing the
Þrst-order asymptotic validity of three alternative bootstrap methods in this environment. Two of
the bootstrap methods we study rely on an application of the wild bootstrap (WB). The WB has
been originally developed by Wu (1986), Liu (1988) and Mammen (1993) in the context of static linear
regression models with (unconditionally) heteroskedastic errors. We consider both a recursive-design
and a Þxed-design version of the WB. The third method is a natural generalization of the pairwise
bootstrap for linear regression Þrst suggested by Freedman (1981) for cross sectional data.
As we will see next, the recursive-design WB requires a strengthening of Assumption A in order to
ensure convergence towards the correct asymptotic covariance matrix C. In contrast, the Þxed-design
WB and the pairwise bootstrap are valid under the more general Assumption A.
Recursive-design wild bootstrap
The recursive-design WB is a simple modiÞcation of the usual recursive-design bootstrap method
for autoregressions (see e.g. Bose, 1988) which consists of replacing Efron's i.i.d. bootstrap by the wild
bootstrap when bootstrapping the errors of the AR model. More speciÞcally, the recursive-design WB
bootstrap generates a pseudo time series {y
t
} according to the autoregressive process:

where ^

t
= ^

, with ^
t = ^
n
(L) yt, and where t
is an i.i.d. sequence with mean zero and variance one
such that E |t
|4   < . We let y
t
= 0 for all t  0. Kreiss (1997) suggested this method in the
context of autoregressive models with i.i.d. errors, but did not investigate its theoretical justiÞcation
in more general models. Here, we will provide conditions for the asymptotic validity of the recursive-
design WB proposal for Þnite-order autoregressive processes with possibly conditionally heteroskedastic
errors. To show this result we need to strengthen Assumption A as follows:
Assumption A0
(iv0) E
¡
2
t
t-rt-s
¢
= 0 for all r 6= s, for all t, r  1, s  1.
(vi0) E |t|4r is uniformly bounded for some r  2 and for all t.
Assumption A0 restricts the class of conditionally heteroskedastic autoregressive models in two di-
mensions. First, Assumption A0 (iv0) requires the product moments of {t} up to order four to behave as
those of an independent series. Milhøj (1985) shows that this assumption is satisÞed for the ARCH(p)
model with innovations having a symmetric distribution. Bollerslev(1986) and He and Teräsvirta (1999)
extend the argument to the GARCH(p, q) case. In addition, Deo (2000) shows that this assumption
is satisÞed by certain stochastic volatility models. Nevertheless, Assumption A0 (iv0) excludes some
non-symmetric parametric models such as asymmetric EGARCH. Second, we now require the existence
of at least eight moments for the martingale difference sequence {t} as opposed to only 4r moments, for
some r > 1, as in Assumption A. A similar moment condition was used by Kreiss (1997) in his Theorem
4.3, which shows the validity of the recursive-design WB for possibly inÞnite-order AR processes with
i.i.d. innovations.
The strengthening of Assumption A is crucial to showing the asymptotic validity of the recursive-
design WB in the martingale difference context. In particular, conditional on the data, and given the
independence of {t

The Þxed-design WB corresponds to a regression-type bootstrap method in that (3.2) is a Þxed-design
regression model, conditional on the original sample. The Þxed-design WB was suggested by Kreiss
(1997). Kreiss' (1997) Theorem 4.2 provides the Þrst-order asymptotic validity of the Þxed-design WB
for Þnite-order autoregressions with conditional heteroskedasticity of a speciÞc form. More speciÞcally,
he assumes a data generating process of the form yt =
P
p

yt-i +  (yt-1) vt, where vt is i.i.d. (0, 1)

with Þnite fourth moment. The i.i.d. assumption on the rescaled innovations vt is violated if for instance
the conditional moments of vt depend on past observations. We prove the Þrst-order asymptotic validity
of the Þxed-design WB of Kreiss (1997) under a broader set of regularity conditions, namely Assumption
A.

Pairwise bootstrap
Another bootstrap method that captures the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity in autore-
gressive models consists of bootstrapping "pairs", or tuples, of the dependent and explanatory vari-
ables in the autoregression. This method is an extension of Freedman's (1981) bootstrap method
for the correlation model to the autoregressive context. In the AR(p) model, it amounts to re-
sampling with replacement from the set of tuples

4. Simulation Evidence
In this section, we study the accuracy of the bootstrap approximation proposed in section 3 for sample
sizes of interest in applied work. We focus on the AR(1) model as the leading example of an autore-
14
gressive process. The DGP is yt = 1
yt-1 + t with 1
 {0, 0.9}. In our simulation study we allow
for GARCH(1,1) errors of the form t =

htvt, where vt is i.i.d. N (0, 1) and ht =  + 2
t-1
+ ht-1,
t = 1, . . . , n. We normalize the unconditional variance of t to one. In addition to conditional N(0,1)
innovations we also consider GARCH models with conditional t5-errors (suitably normalized to have
unit variance). For  = 0 this model reduces to an ARCH(1) model. For  = 0 and  = 0 the
error sequence reduces to a sequence of (possibly non-Gaussian) i.i.d errors. We allow for varying
degrees of volatility persistence modeled as GARCH processes with  +   {0, 0.9, 0.99}. In addition,
we consider AR(1) models with exponential GARCH errors (EGARCH), asymmetric GARCH errors
(AGARCH) and with the GJR-GARCH errors proposed by Glosten, Jaganathan and Runkle (1993).
Our parameter settings are based on Engle and Ng (1993). Note that many of these processes are not
covered by either the conventional asymptotic theory or by the asymptotic theory for the bootstrap.
In particular, the assumption of a Þnite fourth moment may be violated for some parameter settings.
Nevertheless, it is important to investigate the robustness of these methods to such departures from
our assumptions.
Finally, we also consider the stochastic volatility model t = vt exp(ht) with ht = ht-1 + 0.5ut,
where || < 1 and (ut, vt) is a sequence of independent bivariate normal random variables with zero
mean and covariance matrix diag(2
u
, 1). This model is a m.d.s. model and satisÞes Assumption A.
We follow Deo (2000) in postulating the values (0.936, 0.424) and (0.951, 0.314) for (, u). These are
values obtained by Shephard (1996) by Þtting this stochastic volatility model to real exchange rate
data.
We generate repeated trials of length n = 120 and n = 240 from these processes and conduct
bootstrap inference based on the Þtted AR(1) model for each trial. All Þtted models include an
intercept. The number of Monte Carlo trials is 1,000 with 1,000 bootstrap replications each. The Þxed-
design and recursive-design WB involve applying the WB to the residuals of the Þtted model. Recall
that the WB innovation is 
t
= ^
tt
, with ^
t = yt - ^
1n
yt-1, where t
is an i.i.d. sequence with mean
zero and variance one such that E |t
|4r   < . In practice, there are several choices for t
that
satisfy these conditions. In the simulations we use t
 N(0, 1). Our results are robust to alternative
15
choices including the two-point distribution t
= -(

5-1)/2 with probability p = (

5+1)/(2

5) and
t
= (

5+1)/2 with probability 1-p, as proposed by Mammen (1993), and the two-point distribution
t
= 1 with probability 0.5 and t
= -1 with probability 0.5, as proposed by Liu (1988).
We are interested in studying the coverage accuracy of nominal 90% symmetric percentile-t bootstrap
conÞdence intervals for the slope parameter 1
. We also considered equal-tailed percentile-t intervals,
but found that symmetric percentile-t intervals in all cases were at least as accurate. Unlike the
percentile interval, the construction of the bootstrap t-interval requires the use of an estimate of the
standard error of n1/2(b


1n
- b
1n
). We use the heteroskedasticity-robust estimator of the covariance
proposed by Nicholls and Pagan (1983) based on work by Eicker (1963) and White (1980). We
also experimented with several modiÞed robust covariance estimators (see MacKinnon and White 1985,
Chesher and Jewitt 1987, Davidson and Flachaire 2000). For our sample sizes, none of these estimators
performed better than the basic estimator proposed by Nicholls and Pagan (1983). Finally, virtually
identical results were obtained based on WB bootstrap standard error estimates. The latter approach
involves a nested bootstrap loop and is not recommended for computational reasons. As a benchmark
we also include the coverage rates of the Gaussian large-sample approximation based on Nicholls-Pagan
robust standard errors.
We begin with a review of the simulation results for the stationary AR(1) model. Starting with
the results for N-GARCH errors in Table 2 several broad tendencies emerge. First, the accuracy of the
standard recursive-design bootstrap procedure based on i.i.d. resampling of residuals is high when the
model errors are truly i.i.d., but can be very poor in the presence of N-GARCH. Second, conventional
large-sample approximations based on robust standard errors are more accurate than the recursive-
design i.i.d. bootstrap in the presence of N-GARCH, but less accurate for models with i.i.d. errors.
In either case, their coverage rates may be substantially below the nominal level. Third, all three
robust bootstrap methods are more accurate than the i.i.d. bootstrap or the conventional Gaussian
approximation. Fourth, the recursive-design WB is always at least as accurate as the Þxed-design
WB and the pairwise resampling procedures, and its accuracy is very high for all variations of the
DGP, including models with i.i.d. innovations. SpeciÞcally, for n = 120 and AR(1) models with high
16
persistence, the accuracy of the recursive-design WB tends to be higher than for the pairwise bootstrap.
For n = 240, these differences vanish and both methods are equally accurate. The Þxed-design WB is
typically less accurate than the recursive-design WB both for n = 120 and for n = 240, although the
discrepancies diminish with the larger sample size.
The results for the AR(1) model with t5-GARCH errors in Table 3 are qualitatively similar, except
that the recursive-design i.i.d. bootstrap and the conventional Gaussian approximation are even less
accurate than for N-GARCH processes. In Table 4 we explore a number of additional models of
conditional heteroskedasticity that have been used primarily to model returns in empirical Þnance. The
results for the stochastic volatility model are qualitatively the same as for N-GARCH and t-GARCH.
For the other three models, we Þnd that there is little to choose between the recursive-design WB and
the pairwise bootstrap. Their accuracy for n = 120 and highly persistent data tends to be slightly below
nominal coverage, but consistently higher than that of any alternative method. In all other cases both
methods are highly accurate. Neither the i.i.d. bootstrap nor the conventional Gaussian approximation
perform well. The high accuracy of the recursive-design WB even for EGARCH, AGARCH and GJR-
GARCH error processes is surprising, given its lack of theoretical support for these DGPs. Apparently,
the asymptotic inconsistency of the recursive-design WB method has little effect on its performance in
small samples. Fortunately, applications in Þnance, for which such asymmetric volatility models have
been developed, invariably involve large sample sizes, conditions under which pairwise resampling is
just as accurate as the recursive-design WB and theoretically justiÞed.
Given the computational costs of the simulation study, we have chosen to focus on a stylized autore-
gressive model, but have explored a wide range of conditionally heteroskedastic errors. Although our
simulation results are necessarily tentative, they suggest that the recursive-design WB should replace
conventional recursive design i.i.d. bootstrap methods in many standard applications. The pairwise
bootstrap provides a suitable alternative when sample sizes are at least moderately large and the pos-
sibility of asymmetric forms of GARCH is a practical concern. Even for moderate sample sizes the
accuracy of the pairwise bootstrap is slightly higher than that of the Þxed-design bootstrap, which
appears only suited for very large samples.
17
5. Concluding Remarks
The aim of the paper has been to extend the range of applications of autoregressive bootstrap methods
in empirical Þnance and macroeconometrics. We documented widespread evidence of conditional
heteroskedasticity not just in Þnancial time series, but also in monthly macroeconomic data. We
analyzed the theoretical properties of three bootstrap procedures for stationary autoregressions that
are robust to conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form: the Þxed-design WB, the recursive-design
WB and the pairwise bootstrap.
Throughout the paper, we established conditions for the Þrst-order asymptotic validity of these
bootstrap procedures. We did not attempt to address the issue of the existence of higher-order asymp-
totic reÞnements provided by the bootstrap approximation. Arguments aimed at proving asymptotic
reÞnements require the existence of an Edgeworth expansion for the distribution of the estimator of
interest. Establishing the existence of such an Edgeworth expansion is beyond the scope of this paper.
Moreover, the quality of the Þnite-sample approximation provided by analytic Edgeworth expansions
often is poor and less accurate than bootstrap approximations. Thus, Edgeworth expansions in general
are imperfect guides to the relative accuracy of alternative bootstrap methods (see Härdle, Horowitz
and Kreiss 2001). Indeed, preliminary simulation evidence indicates that wild bootstrap methods based
on two-point distributions that may yield asymptotic reÞnements in our context tend to perform no
better than - and in some cases worse than - the Þrst-order accurate methods studied in this paper.
Nevertheless, we found that the robust bootstrap approximation was typically more accurate in small
samples than the usual Þrst-order asymptotic approximation based on robust standard errors. Our
simulation results also highlighted the dangers of incorrectly modelling the error term in dynamic re-
gression models as i.i.d. We found that conventional residual-based bootstrap methods may be very
inaccurate in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity.
The theoretical and simulation results in this paper suggested that no single bootstrap method for
dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form will be optimal in all cases. We concluded
that the recursive-design WB is well-suited for many applications in empirical macroeconomics. This
method performs equally well, whether the error term is i.i.d. or conditionally heteroskedastic, but it
18
lacks a theoretical justiÞcation for some forms of GARCH that have Þgured prominently in the literature
on high-frequency returns. When the sample size is at least moderately large and asymmetric forms of
GARCH are a practical concern, the pairwise bootstrap method provides a suitable alternative . The
Þxed-design WB has the same theoretical justiÞcation as the pairwise bootstrap for parametric models,
but based on our simulation evidence appears only suited for very large samples.
There are several interesting extensions of the approach taken in this paper. One possible extension
is the development of bootstrap methods for conditionally heteroskedastic stationary autoregressions
of possibly inÞnite order. This extension is the subject of ongoing research. Another useful extension
would be to establish the validity of the recursive-design WB for regression parameters in I(1) autore-
gressions that can be written in terms of zero mean stationary regressors, generalizing recent work by
Inoue and Kilian (2002) on I(1) autoregressive models with i.i.d. errors. Yet another useful extension
would be to establish the asymptotic validity of robust versions of the grid bootstrap of Hansen (1999).
These extensions are nontrivial and left for future research.

A. Appendix
Throughout this Appendix, K denotes a generic constant independent of n. We use u.i. to mean
uniformly integrable. Given an m × n matrix A, let kAk =
P
m
i=1
P
n
j=1
|aij|; for a m × 1 vector a,
let |a| =
P
m
i=1
|ai|. For any n × n matrix A, diag (a11, . . . , ann) denotes a diagonal matrix with aii,
i = 1, . . . , n in the main diagonal. Similarly, let [aij]
i,j=1,...,n
denote a matrix A with typical element
aij. For any bootstrap statistic T
n
we write T
n
P
 0 in probability when limn P [P (|T
n
| > )] = 0
for any  > 0, i.e. P (|T
n
| > ) = oP (1). We write T
n
dP  D, in probability, for any distribution
D, when weak convergence under the bootstrap probability measure occurs in a set with probability
converging to one. For simplicity, we omit the dependence on n of bootstrap estimators, e.g. ^

The following CLT will be useful in proving results for the bootstrap (cf. White, 1999, p. 133; the
Lindeberg condition there has been replaced by the stronger Lyapunov condition here):

The following Lemma generalizes Kuersteiner's (2001) Lemma A.1. Kuersteiner's Assumption A.1
is stronger than our Assumption A in that it assumes {t} is stationary ergodic, and in that it imposes
a summability condition on the fourth order cumulants.

where m = 4 [r,s]

Lemmas A.2-A.5 are used to prove the asymptotic validity of the recursive-design WB (cf. Theorem
3.2). In these lemmas, ^

t

bootstrap, respectively. Next, we sketch the proof of (ii). For simplicity we take p = 1. The proof for

follows that n-1

for some r > 1, which holds under our moment conditions (in particular, the existence of 4r mo-
ments of t suffices). A similar argument applies to the last two terms of 1n

^

to (b), it suffices that n-1

obtain the results. In particular, for (a), following Theorem 3.3 we can deÞne ^

apply for (b) and (c).
Proof of Lemma A.1. The proof follows closely that of Lemma A.1 of Kuersteiner (2001). We
reproduce his steps under our weaker Assumption A. In particular, we show that for all   Rm such
that 0 = 1 we have n-1/2

Let Zt = 0Yt. We check: (i) n-1
