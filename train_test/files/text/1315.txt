ABSTRACT
Objective: To demonstrate the effect of including both
principal and secondary injuries in the calculation of
national estimates of non-fatal motor vehicle-related
injury, using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance
System­All Injury Program (NEISS­AIP).
Methods: The setting was a stratified sample of 15 US
hospital emergency departments selected among 50
NEISS­AIP hospitals which agreed to participate in the
study. Non-fatal injury data from a special study of the
2004 NEISS­AIP were analysed which allowed up to five
injuries to be coded per case. National estimates of
number and rate of injuries for 2004 were calculated, first
using principal injuries alone, then by including principal
and secondary injuries.
Results: An estimated 4 833 626 principal and second-
ary injuries were sustained by the estimated 2 893 782
motor vehicle occupants involved in a crash and treated in
US hospital emergency departments (EDs) in 2004. This
represents a 67% increase in the total number of injuries
compared with an estimate of principal injury alone.
Incidence of contusions/abrasions and lower trunk injuries
rose most steeply among broad injury types, and whiplash
injury rose 18% in number and rate. A significantly lower
percentage of cases with a single listed injury were
hospitalised (5%) compared with those who sustained
multiple injuries (8%).
Conclusions: Based on an analysis of NEISS­AIP special
study data, the inclusion of both principal and secondary
injuries in national estimates of motor vehicle-related
occupant injury would provide a more comprehensive report
of non-fatal injuries treated in US hospital EDs. Other
countries with ED-based surveillance systems could consider
reporting multiple injuries when assessing injury count
associated with motor vehicle trauma requiring ED care.
Motor vehicle-related trauma is the leading cause
of injury-related death and the fourth leading cause
of non-fatal injury treated in hospital emergency
departments (EDs) in the United States.1 2 This
high degree of mortality and morbidity is partly
attributable to the powerful kinetic forces often
involved in motor vehicle crashes, in which multi-
ple serious injuries to a crash victim can often
occur. Each separate injury suffered by a crash
victim requires time, money and ED resources for
its care, and each therefore should contribute to
the overall count of injury attributable to motor
vehicle-related trauma. Not all injury surveillance
systems, however, recognise multiple injuries per
person when calculating injury estimates. In many
systems, a principal diagnosis of injury serves not
only as the key inclusion criterion, but also as the
sole injury utilised when calculating national esti-
mates of total injury.3 This method could lead to a
substantial underestimate of injury count in terms of
total treated injuries, particularly when applied to
the study of motor vehicle-related trauma. An
example of such a system is the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System­All Injury Program, or
NEISS­AIP. This surveillance system has been used
extensively to describe national estimates of non-
fatal injuries in the United States for all causes and
has provided timely information about emerging
injuries related to consumer products.2 4 5 Although
NEISS­AIP collects valuable information on the
demographics, principal injury and disposition of
incident cases of injury requiring emergency care
around the country, secondary injuries are recorded
only in a short narrative section, at the discretion of
the coder, and remain uncoded.6 The purpose of this
study was to examine the effect of routinely coding
secondary injuries in the NEISS­AIP for inclusion
into national estimates of injury. This could allow
not only for a more comprehensive portrayal of
injury count, but also for a more accurate portrayal
of national injury rates due to the inclusion of
incident injuries identified among secondary diag-
noses. The value of coding multiple injuries is then
further demonstrated by distinguishing persons with
multiple injuries from those with an isolated injury,
and demonstrating how these two types of injury
cases differ by ED discharge disposition.
METHODS
NEISS­AIP database
The NEISS­AIP, maintained and operated by the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is a
nationwide probability sample of 63 hospitals used to
monitor injury-related visits at US hospital EDs.7
Participating hospitals are selected from five strata,
four of which are based on size (total ED visits) and
one other which represents children's hospitals. The
sample is nationally representative, and cases are
weighted by the inverse probability of selection, so
that national estimates of injury can be calculated,
based on initial visits for a given cause of injury. Data
routinely collected via the NEISS­AIP include the
basic demographics of the case (including age, sex and
race), information about the cause of the injury
(including the event, location, intent, mechanism and
consumer product involved), and medical informa-
tion abstracted from the ED chart, such as the
principal diagnosis, principal body region affected,
and ED discharge disposition. CPSC classifies injury
using a unique system that separately codes diagnosis
(eg, fracture) and body region (eg, head).6

Special study data collection and subject selection (1 January
2004­31 December 2004)
A stratified random sample of 15 hospitals (three per stratum)
was selected from the 50 NEISS­AIP hospitals which agreed to
participate in the special study. In addition to routinely
collected data, a special screen in the data acquisition software
required a NEISS coder to record up to four secondary injury
diagnoses per person (and their respective affected body
regions), and to order these injury diagnoses as listed by the
treating physician. The special screen was triggered when the
injured person was identified as a ``motor vehicle occupant''
involved in a collision, rollover, crash or some other event
involving another vehicle or object.6 The type of motor vehicle
involved in the crash could include cars, pickup trucks, vans,
heavy transport vehicles, buses and SUVs, but did not include
small recreational vehicles, such as motorcycles, ATVs, snow-
mobiles and go-carts. This study was approved by CDC's
Institutional Review Board.
Classification of injuries
Each separate injury was assigned a number by its listing in the
ED record (first listed injury through fifth listed injury), and
these were then grouped into two categories: principal injuries
(first-listed injury), and secondary injuries (second through
fifth-listed injuries). Injury count was then calculated in two
ways: first by summing all principal injuries (total principal
injuries), and second by summing principal and secondary
injuries (total multiple injuries).
Calculation of injury rates
To produce stable estimates, NEISS­AIP injury categories for
diagnosis and body region were combined into five broad
diagnosis categories and seven broad body region categories. For
each category, an incident case (person) was identified in two
ways: first by whether a given injury type had been listed as the
principal injury for that person, and second by whether a given
injury type had been listed among any of the five possibly listed
injuries for that person. Due to the broad injury categories used
in this study, a person could often have more than one injury of
a certain type listed among their multiple injuries. For example,
a sprain/strain injury could occur as both the first-listed and
third-listed injury treated in the ED for a given person. As fig 1
shows, such a person would contribute two sprain/strain
injuries to the overall count of sprain/strain injury, but would
contribute only one case of sprain/strain injury to the incidence
of sprain/strain.
Definitions of whiplash and traumatic brain injury
Sprain/strain injuries to the neck were used to define whiplash
injuries, while traumatic brain injury (TBI) was defined by
combining concussions and internal organ injuries of the head.
Although these NEISS­AIP codes can serve only as a proxy for a
more specific diagnosis, this technique has been used in past
studies to identify and study whiplash injury and TBI within
NEISS­AIP datasets.8 9
Calculation of national estimates
National estimates were generated using SAS and SUDAAN
software. Each injury was assigned its own weight, based on the
inverse probability of the selection of the hospital at which
the injured person was treated. National estimates were
calculated by summing the weights for each separate injury,
and 95% CIs around estimates were calculated using a direct
variance estimation procedure that accounted for the sample
weights and the complex sample design.10 For annual rate
calculations per 100 000 persons, denominator data were
obtained from US Census Bureau bridged-race population
estimates for 2004.11
To verify that the sample of 15 hospitals from this special
study could produce national estimates comparable to the full
NEISS sample of 63 hospitals, demographic characteristics of
the two samples were compared and found to be similar. As
expected, the coefficients of variation for national estimates
derived from this pilot study were greater than those for the full
2004 dataset. Most national estimates and rates presented in the
tables had coefficients of variation (CV) less than 30 and were
considered to be reliable. However, a few estimates and rates
had CVs just above 30 and therefore are reported as possibly
unreliable, likely due to the relatively small number of NEISS
hospitals participating in this special study.
Comparison of persons with multiple versus isolated injury
A person treated for ``multiple injuries'' was defined as one in
which two or more injuries were listed in the ED record, while
those with only one listed injury were labelled as having an
``isolated injury''. These two categories were compared by sex,
age and disposition. x2 Tests were applied to test for statistically
significant differences between proportions of the two groups.12
RESULTS
Table 1 compares the total number of principal injuries to the
total number of multiple injuries, with results stratified by
diagnosis and body region. Total injury count attributable to
motor vehicle-related trauma increased 67% when calculated as
the sum of all listed injuries in the ED record. Contusions/
abrasions and lacerations/avulsions were associated with the
greatest increases in count (110% and 62%), while fractures/
dislocations rose 39%. Extremity injuries and lower trunk
injuries accounted for the greatest increases among body regions
(122% and 113%), while the head and neck showed the smallest
increases in count (36% and 21%). In terms of more specific
injuries, an 18% increase in whiplash injury count was identified,
as well as an 11% increase in the unweighted number of TBI
injuries. (Due to the small sample size, the increase for TBI
injuries could only be calculated using unweighted numbers.)
Table 2 presents diagnosis-specific and body-region specific
injury rates. Contusions/abrasions showed the greatest increase
in rate ratio by diagnoses (rate ratio = 1.61), while the lower
trunk region showed the greatest increase by body region (rate
ratio = 2.08). The rate for whiplash injury rose by a factor of
1.18.
Table 3 illustrates the distribution of individual injuries by
their listing in the ED record. It shows that the first two listed
injuries account for nearly 90% of total injury count, with the
second-listed injury alone accounting for 70% of the total
secondary injury count (ie, 2nd through 5th listed injuries).
In table 4, persons with multiple injury are compared to those
with isolated injury by sex, age and disposition. Nearly half
(46%) of all persons in the database were treated in the ED for at
least two injuries. The larger proportion of both multiple injury
patients and isolated injury patients were female. Those in the
0­14 year-old age group were twice as likely to be treated for
isolated injuries as for multiple injuries. Persons with multiple
injuries were significantly more likely to be hospitalised than
those with isolated injuries (8% vs 5% hospitalisation percen-
tage, respectively; p,0.001).

DISCUSSION
We estimate that while 2 893 782 people received ED treatment
for non-fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle-related
trauma in the United States in 2004, they sustained a total of
4 833 626 separate injuries. While the NEISS­AIP currently
describes ED-treated injury count in terms of the number of
persons injured (based on principal injuries alone), this study
shows that total ED-treated injury count due to motor vehicle-
related trauma would increase 67% by recognising and including
up to five treated injuries per person. While this figure still does

not represent the complete count of injuries treated in US
emergency departments (eg, second visits for the same injury
are not included in national estimates), the coding of secondary
injuries could provide a more comprehensive picture of the
number and range of motor vehicle-related injuries which require
emergency care, and impact the rates of injury reported by the
NEISS­AIP. This substantial increase in injury count and injury
rates could have important implications when studying such
issues as the cost of ED care, ED resource allocation, and the time
required to treat motor vehicle trauma victims in the ED.
All diagnosis and body region categories incurred substantial
increases in total count with the addition of secondary injuries;
however, these increases were not evenly distributed to all
categories in terms of relative frequency. While the rank order of
diagnosis types remained unchanged, the addition of secondary
injuries did change the relative frequency of injuries to certain
body regions, with extremity and lower trunk injuries rising in
relative rank order of frequency. Because the diagnosis
categories were very broad, a more specific injury was also
chosen for further study. Whiplash has been cited as the single
most common non-fatal injury diagnosis listed by ED physi-
cians in the United States.8 While its severity may vary
considerably, whiplash is typically considered to be relatively
minor in nature, and may often be listed by ED physicians as a
secondary injury for crash victims who were treated for
multiple injuries in the ED. As a result, whiplash is particularly
prone to being underestimated by ED surveillance systems, such
as the NEISS­AIP, which include only the principal diagnosis in
injury estimates. In one study using NEISS­AIP data, Quinlan et
al8 estimated that approximately 955 000 persons had been
treated in US EDs for whiplash injuries during the year 2000.
While our study estimated that 955 588 persons were treated
with a principal diagnosis of whiplash due to motor vehicle
crash injury in 2004, after including both principal and
secondary injuries, we estimated that the number of people
with whiplash injury increased to approximately 1 127 000.
This suggests that the NEISS­AIP may underestimate national
whiplash injury count by as much as 18%, which could have
important implications for preventive measures which are based
on these estimates.
The inclusion of multiple injuries per person not only led to a
substantial increase in the total number of injuries treated, but
also to an increase in diagnosis-specific and body region-specific
injury rates. This was not due to an increase in the total number
of people injured in crashes overall, but instead to an
identification of new incident cases of injury found by utilising
the secondary injuries when determining incidence. It is
necessary to keep in mind that by recognising multiple injuries
per person, it becomes possible for one person to contribute an

incident injury to more than one diagnosis and body region.
While at least one other study in the literature has demon-
strated an increase in the number of total injuries found by
including multiple injuries in an injury surveillance system,13 no
previous study has utilised multiple injuries to identify new
incident cases of diagnosis-specific and body-region specific
injury, and then use these to calculate revised diagnosis and
body region specific rates. We found that by body region, the
number of persons with lower trunk injury rose most steeply,
with the rate of lower trunk injury doubling in comparison to
principal lower trunk injuries alone. Furthermore, by diagnosis
category, the number of persons with a diagnosis of contusion/
abrasion increased the most relative to other diagnosis
categories, leading to a rate ratio of 1.6 compared to principal
contusion/abrasion injuries alone.
Although up to five possible injuries per motor vehicle crash
victim were recognised in this study, the majority of total injury
count was recorded among the first two listed injuries. The sum
of the first two listed injuries among all crash victims accounted
for 90% of the total injury count apparent among all five listed
injuries. These results suggest that by coding one additional
injury per case (principal or first-listed plus the second-listed
injury), the NEISS­AIP could capture the majority of the motor
vehicle-related injuries treated in the ED. Such a technique
would also prove useful considering the new case definition of
injury which has recently been recommended for national and
state injury surveillance systems which use hospital ED data.14
This new broadened definition includes injuries based on the
first-listed diagnosis code or the first-listed external cause of
injury code, which could occur among any of the listed
diagnoses.14 Using this new definition and counting both the
principal diagnosis (first-listed) and the second-listed diagnosis
for injury cases may provide a more complete assessment of the
total number and rate of injuries in the population of interest as
a measure of injury count, while preserving the epidemiological
integrity of the data.
In this study, the inclusion of multiple injuries per case led
not only to a more comprehensive portrayal of count and rate of
injuries, but also allowed us to distinguish people with multiple
injuries from those with an isolated injury treated in the ED. We
found that persons treated for multiple injuries in the ED were
significantly more likely to be hospitalised than those with an
isolated injury, with hospitalisation percentages of 8% and 5%,
respectively (p,0.001). The ability to distinguish between
people with multiple and isolated injuries may be important
when studying other outcome indices or patient populations.
For instance, the relationship between multiple injury and
clinical outcome has been well studied among hospitalised
patients.13 15 16 One study, for example, demonstrated that
distinguishing multiple from isolated injury cases allowed a
more precise characterisation of the need for ICU care, as well as
for predicting mortality.13 In that study, although 22.5% of all
trauma patients with a principal injury to the head required
ICU care, this figure dropped to 13% for those whose head
injury was their only listed injury. Similarly, whereas 5.8% of all
trauma patients with a principal injury to the head died while
receiving hospital care, this figure dropped to 3.1% for those
with isolated head injuries.
The findings of this pilot study are subject to several
limitations, one of which is inherent to the small size of a pilot
study. First, due to the small sample size and the stratified
probability sample design, national estimates of the number and
rate of injuries for very specific injury types (other than
whiplash) were unreliable and not reported. Even when utilising
very broad injury sub-categories, a number of national estimates
for these sub-categories were unreliable and, therefore, not
reported. Second, this sample was a stratified random sample
from 50 of 63 NEISS­AIP hospitals that agreed to participate.
While the distribution of demographic characteristics of
patients in our 15 NEISS­AIP hospital subsample were similar
to those in the full 63 NEISS­AIP sample, it is possible that our
subsample differed in some unmeasured characteristics relevant
to risk of multiple injuries, such as those associated with
severity of the crash (eg, speed at impact). Third, NEISS­AIP
coders were trained to record ED discharge diagnoses in the
order as listed in the ED record. While ED physicians typically
order diagnoses in declining order of severity, physicians may
use different criteria for determining severity, and may vary in
terms of the types of injury they choose to list in the ED record.
Finally, this study was limited to motor vehicle-related trauma
treated in an ED setting; therefore, the findings may or may not
be relevant when counting multiple injuries per case associated
with other external causes of injury or in other treatment
settings.
CONCLUSION
Multiple injuries requiring emergency care are common among
persons treated in the ED for motor vehicle-related trauma. In
this study, we have described the added number and increased
rate of non-fatal injury that would be reported by a national
surveillance system of ED-treated injury if multiple injuries per
crash victim were included in national estimates. Although the
underlying relative distribution of injuries was largely unaf-
fected by the addition of secondary injuries, this study has
demonstrated that the inclusion of secondary injuries allows for
a more comprehensive portrayal of the total count and rate of
What is already known on this subject
c With more than 2.6 million people treated in US hospital
emergency departments in 2007, motor vehicle traffic
occupant injury was the fourth leading cause for US hospital
emergency department visits for non-fatal injury.
c Many of these injured persons were treated for multiple
injuries, yet multiple injuries are not accounted for when
determining national estimates of injury count by the NEISS­
AIP. This study examines and compares the national injury
count determined by accounting for a single injury per person
versus accounting for any multiple injuries.
What this study adds
c National motor vehicle occupant injury count rose 67% with
the inclusion of both principal and secondary injuries in
national estimates, and 90% of total injury count was captured
by the first two listed diagnoses for each crash victim.
c Rate of contusions/abrasions and lower trunk injuries rose
most steeply among broad injury types, and rate of whiplash
injury rose 18%.
c A significantly lower percentage of cases with a single listed
injury were hospitalised (5%) compared with those who
sustained multiple injuries (8%).

injury attributable to motor vehicle-related trauma treated in
EDs in the United States. Furthermore, this technique allows
one to distinguish motor vehicle occupants with multiple
injuries from those which sustained an isolated injury, which
may be an important issue when studying injury outcome by
hospitalisation, need for ICU care, risk of death, and risk of
disability. An important quality of a surveillance system is its
simplicity, and this study has demonstrated that by recognising
and coding only one secondary injury in addition to the
principal injury for each crash victim, an ED-based injury
surveillance system could capture up to 90% of the total
number of injuries sustained. This addition is likely to be a small
investment in time and resources for the administration of the
surveillance system and would significantly enhance the quality
of its data. As a result, we would suggest that when developing
and refining ED-based national injury surveillance systems
around the world, administrators and public health officials
strongly consider coding for and including at least two injuries
per trauma case in their estimates of injury count and rate.
