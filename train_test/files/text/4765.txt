Introduction
In his book L'existentialisme est un humanisme, Sartre
(1946) tells the following anecdote: During World War II
(WWII), a former student asked his advice on whether he
should join the Résistance and leave behind his widowed
mother, or stay with her and neglect his patriotic duties.
Sartre's advice was, "You are free. Choose." For Sartre, the
moral of the story is that, when someone solicits advice, they
have already chosen the answer they want, as the advice they
wish to receive guides the selection of advice giver. If Sartre's
observation was ever right, in cyber communication it no
longer holds. Increasing numbers of people go online to ask
for, obtain, and presumably act upon advice dispensed by
unknown peers, mindful or not of the potential risks involved
in this practice (e.g., erroneous information, abusive lan-
guage or content, dangerous emotional manipulation from
the advice giver, or receiver, or both).
Just as online advice seekers may have to or may choose
to ignore the identities, ideologies, worldviews, and other
personal characteristics of advice givers, advice givers are
similarly positioned with information about the interlocutors
asking for advice, except for the bits of demographic infor-
mation that are sometimes freely offered or given away in
posts (e.g., age, gender, and some personal circumstances
revealed in the questioning). The advice they offer is thus not
guided by what they think the advice seeker wants to hear (as
in Sartre's interpretation of his experience above) but on
what they think will be relevant or appropriate to an unknown
interlocutor. Thus, advice is formulated on the basis of very
limited contextual information and the few demographic fac-
tors their interlocutors reveal.
A number of researchers have shown that insufficient
information about individuals or situations tends to trigger
from others stereotypical inferences and responses. Thus,
Kunda and Sherman-Williams (1993) propose that, "in the
absence of other information, expectations about an individ-
ual will be guided by stereotypical beliefs about categories
such as his or her profession, ethnicity, or gender" (p. 90).
When it comes to online advice, given that the only piece of
demographic information advice seekers provide is their sex,
sex becomes a salient feature in the interaction. We can spec-
ulate that the salience of gender norms is likely to influence
the nature of advice offered, and thus advice givers will for-
mulate responses based on their internalized gender role
expectations and stereotypes, which may be triggered uncon-
sciously or automatically.

Gender Roles and Expectations:
Any Changes Online?
Susana A. Eisenchlas1
Abstract
One consequence of the advent of cyber communication is that increasing numbers of people go online to ask for, obtain,
and presumably act upon advice dispensed by unknown peers. Just as advice seekers may not have access to information
about the identities, ideologies, and other personal characteristics of advice givers, advice givers are equally ignorant about
their interlocutors except for the bits of demographic information that the latter may offer freely. In the present study,
that information concerns sex. As the sex of the advice seeker may be the only, or the predominant, contextual variable
at hand, it is expected that that identifier will guide advice givers in formulating their advice. The aim of this project is to
investigate whether and how the sex of advice givers and receivers affects the type of advice, through the empirical analysis
of a corpus of web-based Spanish language forums on personal relationship difficulties. The data revealed that, in the absence
of individuating information beyond that implicit in the advice request, internalized gender expectations along the lines of
agency and communality are the sources from which advice givers draw to guide their counsel. This is despite the trend in
discursive practices used in formulating advice, suggesting greater language convergence across sexes.

Gender Stereotypes
"Gender roles" have been described as society's shared
beliefs that apply to individuals on the basis of their socially
identified sex (Eagly, 2009) and are thus closely related to
gender stereotypes. Stereotypes can be conceptualized as the
descriptive aspects of gender roles, as they depict the attri-
butes that an individual ascribes to a group of people (Eagly
& Mladinic, 1989). Stereotyping is often seen as necessary,
as it is a way of simplifying the overwhelming amount of
stimuli one constantly receives from the world (Ladegaard,
1998), constraining potentially infinite numbers of interpre-
tations (Dunning & Sherman, 1997). Another line of inquiry
extends the function of stereotypes from the interpretation to
the rationalization and justification of social practices
(Allport, 1954; Hoffman & Hurst, 1990; Tajfel, 1981).
Common to these interpretations is the view that the result-
ing representation is usually selective, distorted, and often
oversimplified.
Stereotypes of men and women commonly reflect Bakan's
(1966) distinction between two dimensions, often labeled
agency, or self-assertion, and communion, or connection
with others (Eagly, 2009; Jost & Kay, 2005; Rudman &
Glick, 2001). Men are generally thought to be agentic--that
is, competent, assertive, independent, masterful, and achieve-
ment oriented, while women are perceived as inferior to men
in agentic qualities. Conversely, women are generally
thought to be communal--that is, friendly, warm, unselfish,
sociable, interdependent, emotionally expressive and rela-
tionship oriented--while men are perceived as inferior in
communal qualities (Eagly & Mladinic, 1989). Empirical
studies investigating the extent to which gender stereotypes
apply have consistently found that their content is heavily
saturated with communion and agency (Eagly & Mladinic,
1989; Eagly & Steffen, 1984; Langford & MacKinnon, 2000;
Rudman & Glick, 2001; Spence & Buckner, 2000). Masculine
and feminine stereotypes can be seen as complementary in
the sense that each gender is seen as possessing a set of
strengths that balances out its own weaknesses and supple-
ments the assumed strengths of the other group (Cameron,
2003; Jost & Kay, 2005). The alleged complementarity of
attributes serves to reinforce male superiority and female
subordination as it naturalizes these beliefs, thus making
them acceptable to men and women (Jost & Kay, 2005;
Rudman & Glick, 2001). W. Wood & Eagly (2010) further
suggest that these distinctions appear to be pancultural, a
strong claim that requires empirical investigation.
Gender roles are descriptive and prescriptive (Eagly,
2009). The descriptive aspect, or stereotype, tells men and
women what is typical for their sex in particular contexts and
situations. The prescriptive aspect tells them what is expected
or desirable (Rudman & Glick, 2001). Prentice and Carranza
(2002) illustrate this claim:
The stereotypic belief that women are warm and caring is
matched by a societal prescription that they should be warm and
caring. Similarly, the stereotypic belief that men are strong and
agentic is matched by a societal prescription that they should be
strong and agentic. (p. 269)
Violations of gender role expectations are met with criti-
cism and penalized (Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman &
Glick, 2001). Furthermore, societal gender prescriptions
tend to be internalized and thus self-imposed to a certain
extent (Postmes & Speares, 2002). Thus, W. Wood and Eagly
(2010) suggest that the power of gender roles is their embed-
dedness "both in others `expectations thereby acting as social
norms and in individuals' internalized gender identities,
thereby acting as personal dispositions" (p. 645). This
explains, at least partly, the potency and stability of gender
expectations that seem to endure despite changes in tradi-
tional gender relations we have experienced in recent
decades, and the finding that gender stereotyping appears to
be equally strong among women and men (Blair & Banaji,
1996; Rudman & Glick, 2001).
Kunda and Sherman-Williams (1993) claim that stereo-
types affect impressions even in the presence of individuat-
inginformation,byaffectingtheconstrualofthatinformation.
Similarly, Dunning and Sherman (1997) argue, on the basis
of a series of experiments they conducted, that specific infor-
mation about individuals does not reduce the impact of ste-
reotypes, as stereotypes often lead people to make tacit
inferences about that information. They found that these
inferences alter the meaning of the information to affirm the
implicit stereotypes people possess. Moreover, experimental
research on stereotypical beliefs about social categories has
shown the strong impact they have, even in the absence of
conscious endorsement (Jost & Kay, 2005; W. Wood &
Eagly, 2010). Dunning and Sherman poignantly refer to this
phenomenon as an "inferential prison" and wonder whether
stereotypes are "maximum security prisons, with people's
inferences and impressions of the person never escaping far
from the confines of the stereotype" (p. 459), or whether
people can escape these prisons as knowledge increases.1
Language is one area where gender roles and expectations
can be constructed and reproduced. The notions that through
language women exhibit same-sex solidarity and "support"
whereas men harass and "control" (Fishman, 1978) or that
women talk to foment or enhance relationships, while men
talk to solve problems, are among the most entrenched gen-
eralizations found in popular culture and are widely exploited
by the advertising industry, among other media (Talbot,
2000). These views, however, have been challenged in recent
language and gender literature. For instance, Eckert and
McConnell-Ginet (1992) argue that these gendered portray-
als derive from research on the American White middle class
and are far from being universal. Verbal practices that contra-
dict the stereotypical generalizations have been documented
by Ochs (1992) in her study of Western Samoan households,
by Bierback (1997) in her study of a Barcelona neighbor-
hood association, by Morgan (1991) in a study of African
American discursive practices, and by Macaulay (2001) in
Eisenchlas 3
her study of political radio and television interviews, among
others. Research on gendered practices in Computer
Mediated Communication (CMC) has also yielded conflict-
ing results; while some studies report correlations between
gender and language used online (e.g., Herring, 1993, 2000,
2004), others do not (e.g., Huffaker & Calvert, 2005).
These contradictory findings suggest that gendered lin-
guistic practices are highly context-specific, and that the
context of the interaction may be more important than gender
per se in determining linguistic behavior (Cameron, 1992;
Rodino, 1997). Thus, rather than looking for binary categori-
zations of gendered behaviors, current scholarship focuses
on localized instances, and on how gender is socially per-
formed, co-constructed, and negotiated in interactions
(Butler, 1990; del-Teso-Craviotto, 2006, 2008; Macaulay,
2001). The concept of Communities of Practice (CofP) has
been particularly fruitful in examining the construction of
gender through language. CofP has been defined as "an
aggregate of people who come together around mutual
engagement in some common endeavour. Ways of doing
things, ways of talking, beliefs, values, power relations--in
short, practices emerge in this course of mutual endeavour"
(Eckert & McConnell-Ginet, 1992, p. 464). Participants in
the present study do not constitute a community in the strict
sense of the term as their interactions are usually limited to a
single exchange, which is insufficient to develop common
practices. It is likely then that in giving advice, participants
are drawing on preexisting norms of how this speech act
should be expressed, rather than on their knowledge of
coparticipants in the interaction or the norms of the particular
group.
Gender and Prosocial Behaviors
"Prosocial behaviours" are "behaviors consensually regarded
as beneficial to others," and include actions such as helping,
sharing, comforting, guiding, rescuing, and defending
(Eagly, 2009, p. 644). Advice giving, the topic of this article,
can be considered as one type of prosocial behavior.
Although experimental studies on prosocial behaviors
have shown that men and women readily help others in need,
beliefs about gender roles lead to the expectation that differ-
ences in helping behavior would obtain across genders:
Women will approach help in ways that are primarily com-
munal, whereas men will have primarily an agentic focus.
Outside of academia, these notions have been popularized by
books such as You Just Don't Understand (Tannen, 1990),
which claim that men "report talk," that is, they talk to solve
problems, while women "rapport talk," that is, they talk to
foment or enhance relationships. Grey (1992), in the book
that became probably the biggest seller in its category, Men
Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, endorses these dis-
tinctions and claims that these differences in communication
across genders are universal.2 Moreover, if these are internal-
ized expectations, the sex of the advice seeker should have as
big an effect on the type of advice offered as the sex of the
advice giver, in particular, in situations where extragender
variables are unknown and the only salient variable is sex.
One area where these expectations can be explored is in
computer-mediated interactions among strangers. Following
its wide expansion across all demographics, the Internet was
initially hailed as an inherently democratizing medium that
would enable access to all those with literacy skills and tech-
nological savvy, making social differences irrelevant or
invisible online. Contrary to early expectations, however,
claims of widespread gender equality have not been sup-
ported by most research on online interaction (Harp &
Tremayne, 2006; Herring, 2000). Indeed, a growing body of
research examining chats, forums, and listservs has found
that certain phenomena associated with stereotypical charac-
terizations of gendered linguistic behavior were not dimin-
ished but actually reinforced online.3 Thus, if the type of
advice is guided by implicit gender stereotypes, there is little
reason to believe that the medium of interaction will impose
dramatic departures from societal norms. Rather, it is
expected that off-line gender dynamics will likely be repro-
duced online and that gender expectations found off-line will
creep into online interactions.
The Present Study
To test whether the distinction between expectations of
agency and communality obtains outside the English speak-
ing environment, this study extends the discussion into
Spanish language, by investigating whether there is a rela-
tionship between gender and the type of advice people give
and receive online from unknown interlocutors. Its particular
concern is advice on difficulties in intimate relationships.
Previous studies on advice giving (online and off-line) have
examined expert­nonexpert interactions (e.g., DeCapua &
Findlay Dunham, 1993; Hudson, 1990; Locher, 2006), where
issues of power, hierarchy, or expertise can play a significant
role in advice givers' linguistic expressions (Vine, 2009).
Peer-to-peer advice among strangers has received signifi-
cantly less attention.
The present study is part of a larger investigation explor-
ing gendered linguistic practices in peer-to-peer online
advice giving, focusing on the discursive formulation of
advice tokens in the Spanish language (Author, 2012). It was
expected that, if stereotypical characterizations of gendered
behavior hold (e.g., Tannen, 1990), considerable differences
between men and women would be found in the formulation
of advice on relationships difficulties, with men being con-
cise and direct and women being more emotionally expres-
sive, exhibiting higher displays of emotional language and
higher levels of indirectness to protect others'feelings. These
expectations were not supported, as no significant differ-
ences were found in the discursive formulation4 of advice
dispensed by males and females. Instead, the data showed
that males and females were very direct in their advice,

favoring bald directives over all other possible linguistic
expressions. Furthermore, it was expected that the sex of the
addressee would trigger different responses in terms of
directness and politeness, with men receiving advice
expressed in blunter, more direct formulations. Contrary to
expectations, the sex of the addressee did not make a signifi-
cant difference, as males and females were equally forward
and direct when dispensing advice to either sex. Thus, the
expectation that there would be marked differences in the
language used online by males and females, as suggested by
previous research (Herring, 1993 and subsequent work; Selfe
& Meyer, 1991), was not met.
The lack of attested differences in the discursive formula-
tion of advice in online interactions, however, need not cor-
relate with lack of gender differences in the type of advice.
As shown in the literature, implicit gender role stereotypes
can be activated when identifying information is minimal
(Kunda & Sherman-Williams, 1993). In the data analyzed in
this article, the only demographic information that partici-
pants explicitly provided about themselves was their sex, and
thus it is expected that the sex of the discussants will be a
salient factor in the interaction. Thus, the present study seeks
to contribute epistemically to this area through an examina-
tion of the effect of the sex of online interlocutors on the type
of advice given to them, that is, what type of advice is given
to males and females--not just what type of advice they pro-
duce--and to identify whether implicit stereotypes play a
role.
Based on the above discussion, the following hypotheses
were formulated and tested in the present study:
Hypothesis 1: There will be a difference between the
advice given by men and by women.
Hypothesis 2: Men will be more likely to be advised to
act and women to communicate.
Hypothesis 3: There will be a difference in the type of
talking advice given to men and to women.
Hypothesis 4: As advice givers and as interlocutors,
women will exhibit more emotional disclosure and dis-
play than men.
Methodological Approach
Computer-mediated discourse analysis (CMDA; Herring,
2004) was used to investigate production mechanisms of
advice giving within a small corpus of online advice col-
lected in web-based discussion forums. CMDA attempts to
characterize how the properties of computer-mediated inter-
active written discourse are influenced by social and cultural
factors. This method is particularly well suited to systemati-
cally explore the quality and quantity of particular properties
of the language used online. This data collection method has
a number of advantages over others: (a) it enables direct
access to online behavior and socialization patterns in inter-
actional settings; (b) as the data, although written, also
exhibits features of spoken language (Soffer, 2010; Yates,
1996; Yus, 2010), researchers can tap into what speakers
actually say or write rather than speculate about or infer from
speakers' intuitions or knowledge of prescribed norms,
which are not always reliable indicators of behavior (one of
the problems of surveys and discourse completion question-
naires); (c) it can yield a large number of linguistic tokens
that can be used easily to create a corpus without the time
and effort involved in transcribing oral interactions (one of
the limitations of Conversation Analysis); and (d) it can
accommodate text-based as well as graphic signs such as
emoticons, which form a crucial part of the message.
The Data
The corpus of advice offers analyzed in this article was col-
lated from responses to 17 questions posted by males and
females in 2008-2009 on eight public web-based Spanish
language sites (the appendix lists the websites consulted).
Two of these sites were primarily advice oriented (i.e.,
Acomplejados, PSICOFXP), while the others were open
forums. In both cases, participants choose the topics of the
questions and obtained responses from peers, not from pro-
fessionals.5 The questions posted asked for advice on how to
break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend without hurting their
feelings. A total of 223 responses were obtained from 185
contributors. In all, 169 of the posts indicated the sex of their
contributor--86 from males and 83 from females--while for
the remaining 54 posts the contributor's sex was unspecified.
With regard to advice receivers, 120 were males and 103
were females. These figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively.
Procedure
The vast bulk of online posts included in the analysis were
treated as advice on the basic criteria that the respondent has
Eisenchlas 5
used (a) explicitly marked recommendations; (b) directives,
which in Spanish are typically expressed through impera-
tives ("positive commands") or subjunctives following nega-
tion ("negative commands"); (c) modal verbs of obligation;
(d) value judgment or impersonal expressions; or (e) that the
response included a personal experience that offered an
implicit but unambiguous suggestion on a course of action to
take. Examples of each type are shown in Table 3. The strat-
egy type is given in the left column, followed by an example
in Spanish and its translation.
Responses limited to sharing an experience but that did
not propose a solution, or where the focus was on criticizing
or abusing the advice seeker did not qualify as advice follow-
ing the strict criteria adopted for this study and were thus
disregarded. All websites used, except for Yahoo Mexico and
Vogue España, were from Argentina, as the list of sites in the
appendix reveals. However, the respondents' backgrounds
varied more than the list suggests due to the global
accessibility that the Internet affords. This was evident in the
respondents' use of regionalisms that are not typical of
Argentinian Spanish, and whose origin could not be identi-
fied in some instances. For this reason, respondents' geo-
graphical backgrounds, which could have yielded cross-
dialectal differences, were ignored in this study.
Having identified the posts that fulfilled the criteria, the
next step of analysis consisted of systematically classifying
and coding each post according to the type of advice given.
Three clearly distinct categories emerged, with the advice
givers recommending that the advice seeker (1) embark on
some sort of action or (2) talk with their partner, and this
advice type involved either (2a) telling the truth or (2b) lying
or giving excuse. Many responses in Category 2b show
attempts at humor, either as a mitigating strategy or as a way
of mocking the advice seeker. A third strategy involved pre-
senting alternatives (y . . . si no hay más onda . . . deciselo . .
. o desaparece [well, if there is no vibe . . . tell him . . . or
disappear]). As very few posts used this strategy, the results
were subsumed into the relevant first two strategies. Table 4
presents an example of each type of advice strategy found in
the data. The response type is given in the left column, fol-
lowed by an example from the corpus and its translation in
the central and right columns, respectively.
The next step involved quantifying the frequency distri-
bution of the different strategies. A total of six measures of
advice (three to male advice seekers, three to female advice
seekers) were examined in terms of the extent to which the
frequency of these categories of advice differed when given
by male versus female advice givers. Participants' advice
was reported in terms of sex of advice giver and frequency of
advice giving per sex of advisee. Twenty percent of the posts

Results
Advice Given by Males and Females
(Hypothesis 1)
Table 5 displays the results for type of advice in online data
as a function of advice givers' sex, disregarding the sex of
advice receivers. The number of responses presented here is
smaller than in the previous posts, as the recommendation of
advice givers whose sex could not be ascertained was not
included in the calculation. Overall, advice givers' most fre-
quently recommended strategy to deal with the break up situ-
ation, mentioned by 63% of participants, was to "talk" with
the boyfriend or girlfriend and either discuss the situation or
explain why they wanted to break up the relationship.
However, the examination of frequencies and percentages
per strategy category reveals some interesting trends when
the sex of the advice giver is taken into account. The type of
advice dispensed by males seems evenly distributed between
the two strategies, with a marginal but not significant trend
toward "talk" (51% vs. 49%). But a significant difference
was found in female responses: Predominantly, women pre-
ferred talk to action as a means of problem solving, with 106
respondents (75%) recommending this strategy. Thus, the
proportion of men who advise respondents to act was signifi-
cantly different from the proportion of women who advise
respondents to act, as shown by chi-square tests conducted
on the data (df = 1, n = 169) = 9.025, p = .003.
Advice Given to Males and Females
(Hypothesis 2)
Table 6 summarizes the type of advice given to males and
females, collapsing the responses produced by males,
females, and sex-unidentified advice givers. While the table
shows that talk was still the most recommended strategy,
mentioned by 62% of participants, men and women received
strikingly different advice: Women were advised to talk by
most participants (i.e., 82% gave this advice with only 17.5%
of responses advising them to act). The alternative advice
was given to men, although the differences were not as
blatant: % of responses advised men to act and 45% advised
men to talk. A chi-square test conducted on these data
confirmed that the differences in type of advice as a function
of advice seekers' sex were indeed significant (df = 1, n =
223) = 31.660, p = .000.
Type of "Talking" Advice (Hypothesis 3)
Table 7 summarizes the type of talking advice given by men
and women (n = 106), which the initial analysis classified as
involving two main strategies: telling the truth or lying/giv-
ing excuses. As can be seen in the table, men and women
strongly recommended telling the truth over lying or giving
excuses. Although this tendency was more marked in
females, a chi-square test conducted on these data reveals no
significant difference between the type of talking advice
given by men and women (df = 1, n = 106) = 1.894, p = .169.
Table 8 summarizes the type of talking advice given to
men and women by males, females, and gender-unspecified
participants (n = 139). Males and females were both over-
whelmingly advised to tell the truth (80%) rather than lying
or giving excuses (20%). A chi-square test conducted on
these data reveals no statistically significant difference in
the type of talking advice given to men and women (df = 1,
n = 139) = .000, p = 1.000.
Linguistic Nurturing Behaviors (Hypothesis 4)
Hypothesis 4 predicted that females will conform to the
expected communal orientation, and thus would exhibit
friendliness, warmth, a high level of emotional expressive-
ness, and greater personal disclosure, while men would not.
To test this expectation, a descriptive analysis was conducted
Table 7. Type of "Talking" Advice as a Function of Advice
Givers' Sex (n = 106).

on the data focusing on personal disclosure and affect expres-
sions. Given the limited tokens found in the post, statistical
analyses were not conducted on these data.
Personal Disclosure
A number of advice responses included sharing personal
experiences of feelings similar to the ones described by the
advice seeker, either as a means to establish solidarity or
empathy with the advice seeker or to establish the respon-
dent's expertise to offer advice. Furthermore, in nine of the
posts excluded from previous analyses and classified as
"nonadvice," respondents apologized for not being able to
offer advice but shared past or current experiences with
advice seekers, thus expressing empathy with their peer. An
example can be seen in the following post:
la verdad que no te puedo dar ninguna solucion xq tenemos
casos iguales . . . [The truth is that I can't give you an answer as
we are going through similar cases]
Drawing on stereotypical expectations about gendered
interactions, it was predicted that females would share expe-
riences and disclose personal information more readily than
males. It was further expected that personal stories would
more likely be shared with females than with males, as
females are typically viewed as relationship oriented. Yet,
these expectations were not met. Of the 56 instances of per-
sonal experiences shared by advice givers, 27 were produced
by females and 29 by males. Interestingly, males and females
seemed more willing to share experiences with males, who
were the recipients of 43 (77%) of the reports on
experiences.
Emotional Display
"Emotional display" refers to verbal and nonverbal reactions
elicited in advice givers by the advice seekers'predicaments.
Based on stereotypical characterizations of gendered emo-
tional display, it was expected that women would be more
emotionally expressive than males, and thus their messages
would exhibit greater expressions of empathy and sympathy.
Expressions of sympathy online involve emotive reactions,
such as reporting one's own reactions and feelings about
another's troubles (nomas de leerte ya me rompiste el cora-
zon [just from reading you [your post] you've already broken
my heart]), using nicknames, greetings and farewells, tokens
of encouragement, offers of additional help, and use of emot-
icons and graphical icons to represent emotions. However, as
anger is believed to be more characteristic of males (Brody,
1997; Hutson-Comeaux & Kelly, 2002), it was expected that
males would produce more tokens of abuse or flaming.
Moreover, given the historical imbalance of power between
men and women, more sexist remarks were expected from
male than from female respondents. These expectations were
only partly met. In the following discussion, I examine the
use of some of these devices.
Nicknames and Terms of Endearment
Nicknames can be defined as informal names given to indi-
viduals in place of their given names.6 Although nicknames
can be humorous, disparaging, or affectionate, very few of
the nicknames found in the data were derogatory. As partici-
pants do not know each other, using an affectionate nick-
name to refer to the addressee can be seen as either an attempt
to establish solidarity and show empathy, or as an unwar-
ranted--thus unwelcome--act of familiarity, as in the case
of "street remarks" (Gardner, 1980). The expectation that,
due to their nurturing characteristics, females would estab-
lish solidarity with other females by using a greater number
of nicknames was not met. The total number of nicknames
used was 35, of which 31 were used by males and only 4 by
females. More remarkable is that males used nicknames pre-
dominantly to address other males (n = 27) and only 4 to
address females. This seems to indicate that nicknames act
here as a male bonding practice.
The attempt to establish solidarity with the addressee is
evident in the nicknames used by males. The most frequently
used nickname was amigo [friend] and its variants (e.g.,
compañero [mate], camarada [comrade]; n = 10); flaco (lit.
skinny), loco (lit. crazy), chavón, compadrito, pibe, all
roughly equivalent to "dude" (n = 10); family terms (papa
[dad], hermano [brother]; n = 2); and references to masculin-
ity (varón, macho; n = 2). There were only two female uses
of nicknames for male advice seekers (niño, nene [boy]),
which can be seen as derogatory and patronizing. Terms used
by males to address female advice seekers included a title
(señorita [young lady]) and terms of endearment (amiga
[friend], amor [love], xica [chica] [girl]), but as indicated,
these were extremely rare in the data.
Text-Based and Graphic Emoticons
A total of 34 emoticons were found in the posts, including
four text-based (e.g., XD; =); =P; :() and 30 graphic. The
most frequently used emoticon was the graphical smiley 
7
(n = 9), followed by thumbs up (n = 7). Most of the

graphic emoticons displayed positive messages, except
for the angry (n = 3), sad (n = 2), and sarcastic
(n = 2) tokens. Despite expectations to the contrary and con-
sistent with Huffaker and Calvert's (2005) findings, male
respondents produced more graphic expressions of emotions
than females. Moreover, while no differences were found in
female use of emoticons according to the sex of the addressee,
males used significantly more emoticons when advising
females than when advising males. Table 9 summarizes these
findings.
Greetings, Farewells, and Encouragement
Unlike greetings, which were not frequent (n = 11), farewells
and expressions of encouragement were very common in the
data, comprising a total of 115 tokens. Many advice seekers
ended their posts with wishes of good luck, expressing the
hope that the advice they offered will be useful, or that the
advice seeker feels happier soon (ojala q result todo bien
para vos pibe! [I hope it all works out for you boy!]).
Expressions of affection toward unknown advice seekers
were also frequent (e.g., un abrazo gigante [a giant hug], un
besito [a small kiss], un besote [a big kiss]), as were positive
evaluations of the advice seeker (se ve que sos una buena
persona [it is clear that you are a good person]) and promises
that the advice given will work. A few respondents ended the
post by offering additional help (si le ha parecido mi consejo
puede hacermelo saber o le puedo seguir ayudando mi e
mail es . . . [if you think of my advice you can let me know
or I can continue to help my e-mail is . . .]. Farewells and
expressions of encouragement were grouped together
because at times these could not be clearly separated; some
expressions can serve the two functions (e.g., suerte [good
luck]). These expressions were evenly produced by males
(n = 56) and females (n = 59). The distribution across recipi-
ents was also balanced, with males receiving 57 of these
tokens and females 58.
Flaming
Consistent with findings in previous studies (Herring, 1993,
2004; Selfe & Meyer, 1991), most of the abusive responses
were in posts by males. A post was deemed as "abusive" if it
contained an insulting or derogatory evaluation of the advice
seeker or their partner, as in the following example:
Sos una basura. Ojala te pise un tren a vos [You're rubbish. I
hope you get hit by a train.]
Overall, there were 24 tokens of abuse in the responses
(including nonadvice responses); some directed at the part-
ner of the advice seeker, some at the advice seekers them-
selves as in the example above. Most of the abusive responses
were produced by males (n = 17) rather than by females
(n = 7), and most were directed at males (n = 17) rather than
at females (n = 7).
Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this study was to explore whether gender roles
and expectations identified in the literature are reproduced in
online interactions. The context chosen for this investigation
was one particular type of prosocial behavior, peer-to-peer
advice given in Spanish language forums. As advice givers
ignore all demographic information about advice receivers
except for their sex, it was expected that sex would become
the salient factor in the interaction and impact on the type of
advice, thus revealing implicit role stereotypes and expecta-
tions. The study explored advice as a factor of the sex of
advice givers (when this could be ascertained) and of advice
receivers.
Four hypotheses were formulated. The first two hypothe-
ses addressed the expectation that there would be differences
in the type of advice given by men and women (Hypothesis
1), and that these differences would correlate with expecta-
tions of agency and communality (Hypothesis 2).
Furthermore, differences were expected in the type of "talk-
ing" advice given to men and women, with men expected to
recommend offering excuses or lying more frequently than
women (Hypothesis 3). Finally, Hypothesis 4 focused on
whether the sex of advice givers conforms to the expected
display of emotional expression in females' response posts,
and lack of emotion--other than anger--in males' posts.
With regard to Hypothesis 1, significant differences were
found in the type of advice dispensed by males and females
and thus the hypothesis was supported. The data showed
that, while men were evenly divided between the two main
categories of peer-to-peer advice they offered, "act" and
"talk," women overwhelmingly preferred talk to action as a
mean of problem solving. The results are consistent with the
stereotypical view of women as communal and relationship
orientated.
Hypothesis 2 was strongly supported by the data. While
"talk" was the overall preferred strategy, the gender of advice
seekers affected the type of the advice given to them: Women
were advised to talk by the majority of respondents (n =
82.5%), while men were mostly advised to act (n = 55%).
Although the difference in proportions between the "act"
(55%) versus "talk" (45%) advice given to men were not as
extreme as the differences in advice to women, these differ-
ences were still statistically significant. There was a strong
Eisenchlas 9
correlation between the advice given to males and females
and the two dimensions, agency and communion, proposed
by Bakan (1966). The fact that men and women predomi-
nantly advised men to act and women to speak indicates the
extent to which expected gender roles have been internalized
and are spontaneously triggered when it comes to offering
advice to unknown others. Thus, advice givers "perform"
gender in formulating their advice, by positioning them-
selves and others through the interaction (conf. Butler, 1990).
Hypothesis 3 was not supported, as no statistically signifi-
cant differences were found in the type of "talking" advice
dispensed by males and females. The data showed that males
and females were equally forward in their advice, favoring
telling the truth over lying or giving excuses to the partner
when dispensing advice to interlocutors of either sex.
Finally, Hypothesis 4 was unsupported, as the data showed
that neither sex had a monopoly on affect display. While men
produced most expressions of anger, when it came to "posi-
tive" emotions men were just as prone as women to display
emotions online (e.g., through the use of emoticons, expres-
sions of empathy, affections and encouragement, adulation,
personal disclosure, nicknames and terms of endearment
used to address other males), at times producing more emo-
tional tokens than women did, and not just with other males
but in their responses to females as well. The data showed
conclusively that most respondents seemed genuinely inter-
ested in helping advice seekers, regardless of sex, at times
offering additional assistance such as adding a phone number
or email address in case the advice seeker needed to discuss
their situation further. The expectation that the sex of advice
seeker would affect the type and amount of emotion dis-
played, so that women would receive more tokens of emo-
tional support from females while advice dispensed by and to
males would be devoid of emotion was thus not met in the
online data.
The findings that emerge from the analysis of the data
point to an interesting dichotomy: With regard to the type of
advice, it seems clear that gender roles and expectations are
alive and well in online encounters. In the absence of any
demographic information about interlocutors other than their
sex, males and females offered advice that is consistent with
traditional expectations of gendered behavior along the lines
of agency and communality. While the data discussed in this
article is limited to one context and one language, it contrib-
utes to the empirical investigation of whether the traditional
characterization of gender roles proposed in the literature
(e.g., W. Wood & Eagly, 2010) are consistent with those
found in other cultures.
With regard to online use of language across genders,
however, the picture that emerged is more complex than the
stereotypically binary characterization of female versus male
linguistic behavior would lead us to expect, as many of the
differences identified in previous research (Harp &
Tremayne, 2006; Herring, 2000, 2004; Selfe & Meyer, 1991)
were not found in this study. Instead, the data pointed to a
high degree of linguistic convergence, in particular when it
comes to offering emotional support.
A few factors may explain the disparity of the findings.
First, language and culture may play a role. Most of the pre-
vious studies on advice focused on interactions in English,
which may explain differences in results when investigating
linguistic practices operating in other languages. Second,
many of the previous studies have focused on expert­novice
situations, and thus findings may not transfer into peer-
to-peer interactions where issues of hierarchy or expertise
play no role. Another possible explanation relates to the
characteristics of the communication medium. Previous
studies on online exchanges focused on data collected from
electronic bulletin boards, blogs, and discussion groups,
which are not anonymous. The data examined in this article
were collated from sites where the exchanges between par-
ticipants are one-off events. It may be precisely the anonym-
ity of online interactions that encourages men to "open up"
and be more forward in expressing affect, not just abusive
behavior and flaming, but also positive emotions.
Although the corpus on which this naturalistic study is
based was small, the data still pointed to some interesting
results. In particular, it provided further support to the claim
that gendered roles and expectations are triggered spontane-
ously in the absence of individuating information, as these
are the sources from which participants draw to guide their
advice. This is despite discursive practices used in formulat-
ing advice suggesting greater language convergence across
sexes. This discrepancy may indicate that the role of lan-
guage in manifesting and/or constructing "agency" and
"communion" needs to be further explored across types of
sites, languages, cultures, topics, and tasks.

Notes
1. While this is an interesting question, it lies beyond this arti-
cle's scope and thus will not be pursued further here.
2. While these sources have been widely criticized in the gen-
der and language literature as being superficial and lacking in
research support (see, for instance, Cameron, 2007; Crawford,
2004; J. T. Wood, 2002, among many others) the sheer volume
of sales indicates the potential impact these self help popular
psychology books can have on readers.
3. These findings however may not apply to other modalities
of CMC. Needless to say, gender equality in CMC extends
beyond the linguistic styles speakers adopt. Other obvious
sources of inequality include access to resources and differen-
tial forms of participation.
4. Aspects examined included levels of directness, use of polite-
ness markers, and display of emotive features such as emoti-
cons or graphical icons to represent emotions and expressions
of sympathy.
5. The issue of whether there are differences between the two
types of websites was not explored in this article.
6. "Nicknames" in this context should be distinguished from the
pseudonyms participants chose for themselves to participate in
the forums.
