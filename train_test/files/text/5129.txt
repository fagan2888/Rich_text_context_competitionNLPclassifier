Introduction
The benefits of physical activity (PA) for health and well-
being are well documented (e.g. Biddle and Mutrie, 2001;
Brukner and Brown, 2005; Burns and Murray, 2012;
Warburton et al., 2006) and the consequences of physical
inactivity and sedentary living have also been addressed
from both a health implication and an economic cost per-
spective (e.g. Department of Health (DH), 2004a, 2009a;
Garrett et al., 2004). The Health Survey for England data
(HSE, 2003) show that in 2003, only 37per cent of men and
24per cent of women met the PA guidelines suggested by
the Government at that time (DH, 2005). These levels
raised marginally in 2008 to 46per cent of men and 36per
cent of women meeting the guidelines (HSE, 2008). A sub-
sequent re-analysis of the 2008 data using the most recent
PA guidelines indicated that 65­66
per cent of men and
53­56
per cent of women met the revised (DH, 2011) PA
guidelines (HSE, 2012). As a result, PA is increasingly
being considered the best investment in health and has been
included into a series of public health policy publications
(DH, 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2009b, 2011; National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2006a, 2006b,
2006c, 2014).
Exercise referral schemes have become a popular
method of improving health outcomes and reducing physi-
cal inactivity both within the United Kingdom and globally.
In response to the rapid growth of schemes from around the
year 2000, guidelines (the National Quality Assurance
Framework (NQAF)) were produced to assist practitioners
and researchers to design and evaluate such schemes (DH,
2002). In the NQAF, it was also advised that psychological
measures were more likely than physical measures to show
change over a 10-week exercise programme (DH, 2002).

Improving the psychological evaluation
of exercise referral: Psychometric
properties of the Exercise Referral
Quality of Life Scale

Abstract
There is a growing need to assess the psychological outcomes of exercise referral and the National Institute of Health
and Care Excellence has called for the routine assessment of life-quality. However, a quality of life scale specific to the
requirements of exercise referral is currently unavailable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce a quality of
life measure for this purpose. The Exercise Referral Quality of Life Scale is a 22-item measure comprising three domains:
mental and physical health, injury pain and illness and physical activity facilitators. Exploratory factor analysis determined
the initial factor structure and was subsequently confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. Additional scale properties
were also assessed. The scale contributes to the global need for improved consistent psychological outcome assessment
of exercise referral.

10­12weeks, and because of the diversity in the level and
type of evaluation, schemes were advised that they should
only be endorsed by practitioners, policy-makers and com-
missioners when part of a properly designed and controlled
research study to determine effectiveness (NICE, 2006b).
Since these initial publications, a Standard Evaluation
Framework for Physical Activity Interventions has been
developed (National Obesity Observatory, 2012), and more
recent guidance for the implementation and evaluation of
exercise referral schemes has been produced which specifi-
cally states the necessity to include health-related quality of
life (QoL) as an outcome measure (NICE, 2014).
There has been much debate regarding the efficacy of
exercise referral schemes in terms of their ability to increase
individual PA levels and their contribution to health
improvements (e.g. Dugdill et al., 2005; Morgan, 2004;
Pavey et al., 2011; Riddoch et al., 1998). However, histori-
cally, in assessment of such schemes, it was often the case
that relevant psychological and environmental parameters
(such as access to leisure services, suitable transport and
how well the environment outside of structured exercise
supports PA behaviour) were ignored (Dugdill et al., 2005).
Since the earlier attempts to evaluate exercise referral
schemes, efforts have been made to publish findings with
respect to the broader psycho-social outcomes of such
schemes that also include life-quality (e.g. Murphy et al.,
2010). However, because to date there has not been a scale
available that is designed to measure exercise-related life-
quality within clinical populations specifically, practitioners
and researchers have had to resort to the use of generic
measures such as the EuroQoL (EQ-5D; Brooks and
EuroQoL Group, 1996), for example (Murphy et al., 2010).
Consequently, the lack of a specific tool has also resulted in
varied generic tools being utilised in an attempt to measure
exercise-related life-quality (e.g. SF-36; Brazier et al., 1992;
Ware, 1996) which makes comparisons between studies dif-
ficult (Pavey et al., 2011) and challenges efforts to draw
clear conclusions regarding the psychological impact of
exercise referral.
Studies that incorporate more holistic health measures,
that include those specific to exercise-related life-quality,
can recognise the value of person-centred methods of
healthcare practice and focus on the person with the disease
rather than the course of the disease itself (Bauman et al.,
2003). Furthermore, QoL measures have been recognised
as a valuable method of addressing a shift in attention from
controlling a patient's disease to their experience of poten-
tial suffering (Cohen et al., 1996). The inclusion of a QoL
tool specifically designed for exercise referral is likely to
contribute to the necessity to build on the evidence base for
the effectiveness of exercise referral ­ particularly with
respect to health-related life-quality outcomes (NICE,
2014). The Exercise Referral Quality of Life Scale
(ER-QLS) documents the physical and mental health con-
ditions with which individuals have been referred, so there
is capacity to compare total and sub-domain scores accord-
ing to these criteria. It is reasonable that perceived life-
quality may be affected by health condition(s), so there is
a valuable opportunity to explore this further with the
same measure consistently which will allow for QoL scores
that are comparable across schemes, both nationally and
globally.
Six stages of research were undertaken to produce the
final measure. Stage 1 utilised a series of five focus groups
to generate rich data for the purposes of item development
and a conceptual framework of exercise-related life-quality
that would inform subsequent psychometric analyses. Stage
2 employed best-practice recommendations from previous
research to construct test items and formulate a test meas-
ure that was formatted in such a way so as to facilitate its
completion and reduce respondent burden. Stage 3 cogni-
tively pre-tested these test-pool items to ensure that they
were interpreted as intended and to establish appropriate
face and content validity. Stage 4 employed a classical test
theory (CTT) approach to item reduction and also assessed
the initial reliability of the measure through test­retest and
internal consistency analyses. Stage 5 of the development
of the ER-QLS employed factor-analytic methods of test
construction to further reduce the item pool and explore the
structure of the final measure. Internal consistency, test­
retest reliability, acceptability, content validity and conver-
gent and known-groups components of construct validity of
the final measure were also assessed in this stage, and the
final sixth stage of development employed a confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) to inform the final facture structure of
the new measure. This article reports the latter two stages of
scale development.
The primary aim of the current study was to develop and
validate the ER-QLS, a new QoL measure specific to exer-
cise referral settings based on a UK population. The
ER-QLS is not intended to be prescriptive. Rather, the
intention is to support opportunities to contribute to devel-
oping plans for PA promotion within supervised settings
(e.g. Bull and Milton, 2010; Hilton et al., 2009; NICE,
2014), contribute to the growing need to evaluate exercise
referral schemes more effectively (e.g. NICE, 2006b, 2014)
and provide practitioners with the most appropriate tools
for the task.
Method
Participants
Ethical approval was obtained from the UK National
Research Ethics Service (NRES).All participants were pro-
vided with an NRES template information sheet describing
the study and provided full written consent to their
participation.
For the initial exploratory factor analysis (EFA), respond-
ents were recruited from 16 referral schemes across England.
Hilton et al. 3
The referral schemes that participated in the research
programme were invited to do so via telephone. Of the 17
schemes that were approached to act as test sites to generate
the respondent data, only one declined due to resource limi-
tations, resulting in 16 schemes that participated in total.
Exercise referral instructors from each recruitment site con-
veniently sampled individuals who were either at the start, in
the middle or who had been exercising for up to 12months
post-referral to ask whether they would volunteer to com-
plete the test questionnaire. Data from 278 respondents were
available and used for analyses. For the purposes of test­
retest analysis, a nested convenience subsample of 25
respondents completed the questionnaire twice, 7days apart.
The complete cohort of participants ranged in age from 19 to
87years(M=61years,standarddeviation(SD)=12.81years).
A total of 20 respondents' ages were missing in the returned
data. A greater number of females (n=148) than males
(n=128) were included in the analysis. Gender information
for two respondents was missing. The ethnicity of respond-
ents for both the EFA and the CFA and from both the total
and the test­retest subsample can be reviewed in Table 1.
The number of health conditions for which these respondents
were referred can also be reviewed in Table 1. These condi-
tions were typical of those for which individuals are referred
for exercise (e.g. coronary heart disease risk factors).
For the EFA, the majority of respondents (54%) identi-
fied that they were at the mid-stage of their referral pro-
gramme (around 6weeks). While 26per cent identified that
they had completed their initial referral phase of exercise
(12
weeks and beyond), the least amount of respondents
(20%) identified that they had just started their referral
programme. Therefore, the majority of respondents (80%)
had been exposed to at least 6weeks of exercise and PA.
Of the 25 respondents included in the test­retest analy-
sis, participants ranged in age from 36 to 73
years
(M=60years, SD
=
11.94
years). Participant age was pro-
vided by all but one individual who was included in the
test­retest analysis. A relatively equal number of females
(n
=
12) and males (n
=
13) were represented in the
analysis.
As for the entire participant cohort (N=278), the major-
ity of test­retest respondents reported that they were at the
mid-stage of their referral (56%). In total, 36
per cent of
participants reported that they had completed their initial
referral phase of 12
weeks, and 8
per cent of respondents
were at the start of their referral.
For the subsequent CFA, participants from a single exer-
cise referral scheme were recruited. Data from 1750
respondents were available and used for analysis. Five par-
ticipant ages were missing from the returned data. A greater
number of females (n
=
1230) than males (n=512) were
included in the analysis and there were missing data for
eight participants with respect to gender. The ethnicity of
respondents from the CFA sample can be reviewed in Table
1. The most commonly cited reasons for referral were
weight loss (n=670), improvements in fitness (n=246) and
diabetes (n=116). Other commonly cited reasons included
hypertension (n=77), obesity (n=66), weight maintenance
(n
=
54), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
(n=43), depression (n=33), cholesterol (n=23) and back
pain (n=23). It is important to note that leisure profession-
als were not specific in documenting the type of diabetes

with which individuals had been referred, and therefore,
this was unknown. However, subsequent amendments have
been made to the reasons for referral section of the ER-QLS
to allow for this to be more easily defined.
The majority of respondents (74%) identified that they
were at the start of their referral programme, only 0.3
per
cent were midway through and 26
per cent identified that
they had completed their initial referral phase of exercise
(12weeks and beyond).
Materials
The ER-QLS item pool for the final phase of development
contained 29 items. Each item comprised a question that
required a response using a 5-point response scale. Question
content broadly focussed on issues of physical and psycho-
logical well-being as well as issues that related more spe-
cifically to the process of engaging in exercise. For
example, questions included `How would you rate your
physical health?', `How would you rate your ability to
manage stress?' and `How often do you feel you have
achieved something in terms of your physical fitness?'
These 29 items remained from an initial pool of 50, which
was generated from a series of focus groups with partici-
pants from a local exercise referral scheme. Focus groups
explored the experiences of exercise that are of particular
importance to QoL before, during and upon completion of
a 12-week exercise programme. This pool of 50 items had
been reduced to 29 through subsequent phases of question
pretesting, using cognitive interviewing techniques (Willis,
2005), and a CTT approach to item analysis. These early
stages of item development are reported elsewhere.
The WHOQOL-BREF (Skevington et al., 2004) was
used as the comparative generic QoL measure with which
to conduct analyses of convergent validity. The WHOQOL-
BREF is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assess-
ment and measures four domains: physical, psychological,
social and environmental. Mean domain scores are scaled
in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher
QoL) and the measure contains three reverse-scored items.
The psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF were
analysed using cross-sectional data obtained from a survey
of adults carried out in 23 countries (N=11,830). Analyses
of internal consistency, item-total correlations, discrimi-
nant validity and construct validity through CFA indicated
that the WHOQOL-BREF had good to excellent psycho-
metric properties of reliability and performed well in pre-
liminary tests of validity (Skevington et al., 2004).
The Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES;
McAuley and Courneya, 1994) was also used for conver-
gent validity testing because of the documented relation-
ship between perceptions of mood, mood management and
exercise within clinical populations (e.g. Lehrner et al.,
1999; Petajan et al., 1996). The SEES consists of a 3-factor
measure. Two of the three factors correspond with the
positive and negative poles associated with psychological
health, positive well-being and psychological distress,
while the third factor represents subjective indicators of
fatigue.Theinternalconsistencyofthemeasure(Cronbach's
alpha) was reported for positive well-being (0.86), psycho-
logical distress (0.85) and fatigue (0.88). The convergent
and discriminant validity of the SEES were established by
correlations with the Positive and NegativeAffect Schedule
(PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State Anxiety Inventory
(SAI; Spielberger et al., 1970) and the Feeling Scale (FS;
Hardy and Rejeski, 1989). The SEES is scored dimension-
ally with a higher score for positive well-being reflecting a
better state of well-being and a higher score for personal
distress and fatigue indicating greater distress and fatigue,
respectively.
Procedure and analyses
EFA. For the EFA phase of analysis, data were obtained by
exercise referral instructors who were employed by one of
the 16 participating schemes across England. Participants
who had been referred for exercise for health improvement
were conveniently sampled (N=278) and self-completed
each of the scales, including the one under construction.
The item pool was further reduced using factor-analytic
methods of test construction. A principal component analy-
sis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to explore the
structure of the 29 items. Items were rejected if they failed
to display loadings greater than 0.4 on any of the main com-
ponents. The number of components extracted was deter-
mined by parallel analysis. After item rejection, the PCA
was re-run in order to explore the structure of the remaining
items and develop subscales within the ER-QLS. An assess-
ment of scale reliability included analysis of internal con-
sistency (Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlations) and
test­retest reliability over a 1-week period (intraclass cor-
relation coefficient).
The convergent construct validity of the ER-QLS was
assessed by an analysis of Pearson's correlation coefficients
between scores from the ER-QLS and those generated from
the dimensions of the WHOQOL-BREF and SEES. It was
expected that those individuals who reported higher per-
ceptions of exercise-related life-quality on the ER-QLS
would also perceive positive perceptions of generic QoL
(WHOQOL-BREF and SEES). Due to the focus of items in
the ER-QLS, it was expected that it would demonstrate the
strongest associations with the physical and psychological
health dimensions of the WHOQOL-BREF. Associations
with the social relationships and the environment dimen-
sions of the WHOQOL-BREF were expected to be less
strongly correlated but significant. Similarly, the ER-QLS
was expected to show stronger associations with the posi-
tive well-being and psychological distress dimensions of
the SEES and lower but significant associations with
fatigue. Based upon the methods employed by previous
Hilton et al. 5
QoL scale development research, the current study consid-
ered Pearson's correlation coefficients of less than 0.2 as
very weak, from 0.2 to 0.35 as weak, from greater than
0.35 to 0.5 as moderate and of more than 0.5 as strong
(Schunemann et al., 2010).
The known-groups component of construct validity was
assessed by a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that
assessed the level of total test score variance for those at the
start, midway and after completion of their exercise pro-
gramme. It was expected that those who had completed
their exercise programme would report the highest level of
QoL because this group had the greatest amount of expo-
sure to exercise (Laforge et al., 1999).
Confirmatory factor analysis.Data from a single UK
exercise referral scheme (N=1750) were used to confirm
the factor structure of the ER-QLS. Missing values were
replaced with median values before employing a good-
ness-of-fit approach to factor structure assessment with
SPSS Amos (v20). It is generally accepted that confirma-
tory models will be shown to be false when tested with
a large sample size such as that of the current study.
Consequently, applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFS)
research tends to employ sample size independent indices
(Hu and Bentler, 1999; Marsh et al., 1988, 2005; Yu,
2002). The Comparative Fit Index (CFI; Bentler, 1990)
and the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI; Tucker and Lewis,
1973) allow for the measurement of how much better the
proposed model fits the data compared to a baseline model
whereby all variables are uncorrelated. For these indices,
values above 0.90 indicate reasonable model fit and
values above 0.95 indicate good model fit (Bentler, 1990;
Hu and Bentler, 1999). The root mean-square error of
approximation (RMSEA; Steiger, 1990) was also consid-
ered. Values of <0.05 are considered good, 0.05­0.010
moderate and >0.10 poor model fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999).
Results
Initial factor structure
PCA of the 29 items resulted in seven items being rejected
from the item pool as they failed to load on any of the main
components. After rejection of these items, PCA was re-
run on the remaining 22 items. The 22 items were grouped
into a statistically and a conceptually coherent three-
component structure. Parallel analysis confirmed the pres-
ence of at least three components within the items. The
three-component solution explained a total of 50.68
per
cent of the variance, with Component 1 (mental and physi-
cal well-being) contributing 31.48
per cent, Component
2 (injury pain and illness) contributing 10.68per cent and
Component 3 (physical activity facilitators) contributing
8.52per cent of the variance, respectively. Table 2 displays
the loadings of items on these three components. All 22
items included in the three-component solution also loaded
(>0.4) onto a single component if a one-component solu-
tion was forced.
As a consequence, the final scale may be scored dimen-
sionally or as a single global score. The ER-QLS adopts a
scoring system of 1 to 5 for each item with a higher item
and scale score indicating a better perception of exercise-
related life-quality. A reverse scoring of four items is
required. Total scores are presented in the range of 22­110.
Total scores for the dimension mental and physical well-
being are presented in the range of 11­55. Total scores for
the dimension injury pain and illness are presented in the
range of 4­20. Total scores for the dimension physical
activity facilitators are presented in the range of 7­35.
Reproducibility
The 7-day test­retest reliability of the final 22 items scored
as a single scale was assessed by the intraclass correlation
coefficient of scores across the time period. This indicated
an acceptable level of reliability (r19
=0.72, p<0.01). The
test­retest reliability of the three subscales was excellent,
with r23
=0.95 (p
<
0.001) for mental and physical well-
being, r21
=0.80 (p<0.001) for injury pain and illness and
r24
=0.86 (p<0.01) for physical activity facilitators.
Internal consistency
The internal consistency of the 22-item ER-QLS was
good with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88. This value could
not be improved by deleting any of the items.Additionally,
all 22 items met the item-total correlation criteria of r>0.3
(Skevington et al., 2004). The internal consistency of the
three ER-QLS subscales was also good, with a Cronbach's
alpha of 0.87 for mental and physical well-being, 0.81 for
injury pain and illness and 0.77 for physical activity
facilitators.
Construct validity
The descriptive statistics of the data from the ER-QLS
(total score and subscales) and each of the dimensions of
the SEES and the WHOQOL-BREF can be reviewed in
Table 3.
The convergent validity of the scale was also assessed
by an examination of the correlations between scores on
the ER-QLS and those of the WHOQOL-BREF and the
SEES (Table 4). The relative strength of associations var-
ied as predicted, supporting the construct validity of the
new measure. The strongest associations were between
the ER-QLS and the physical and psychological subscales
of the WHOQOL-BREF. Lower but significant correla-
tions were demonstrated with the social and environmen-
tal subscales of the WHOQOL-BREF. Similarly, the
strongest association between the ER-QLS and the SEES
6 Health Psychology Open 
was with the psychological well-being subscale. The cor-
relation values observed between the new measure and
those of the WHOQOL-BREF and the SEES also support
the convergent validity of the ER-QLS. The variance in
the strength of the correlations between the ER-QLS
scores and the respective dimensions of the WHOQOL-
BREF would also suggest that the test instrument is meas-
uring components of life-quality that differ to those
generic dimensions assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF
(Streiner and Norman, 2008).
The descriptive statistics of the data used to assess the
known-groups validity component of construct validity can
be found in Table 5. There were significant differences
between the mean total ER-QLS score for each of the three
groups: those at the start of an exercise referral programme,
those mid-programme and those at the completion, F(2,

significant (F=0.969, p>0.05). The sample sizes were une-
qual (programme start, n=45; mid-programme, n=123;

ance. Results indicated that the largest significant differ-
ence in mean total scores were between those who had just
started their exercise referral programme and those who
had completed (F=0.006, p

nificant difference in mean total scores for those who had
just started their referral programme and those who were
midway through (F=0.03, p

total scores for those respondents midway through their

also for those who had started their programme and those
who were midway through (F=0.040, p>0.05). However,
no such differences were observed for those midway
through their referral programme and those who had com-
peted (F=0.707, p>0.05). With respect to the injury pain

Acceptability
For the ER-QLS, data were missing most frequently in
response to the item that assessed levels of perceived confi-
dence regarding the use of gym equipment (n=8; 3%).
Items that had the lowest level of missing data included
those regarding outlook on life (n=1), self-esteem (n=1)
and sleep quality (n
=
1). The item regarding overall QoL
was responded to by all 278 participants (100%).
Confirmatory factor analysis
The descriptive data for the CFA can be viewed in Table 6.
The internal consistency of the 22-item ER-QLS was
good with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. Additionally, all
22-items met the item-total correlation criteria of r>0.3
(Skevington et al., 2004). The internal consistency of the
three ER-QLS subscales was also good, with a Cronbach's
alpha of 0.90 for mental and physical well-being, 0.86 for
injury pain and illness and 0.83 for physical activity
facilitators. Additionally, the CFI=0.97, TLI=0.96 and
RMSEA=0.04 indicated a good fit of data and sub-dimen-
sionally, all factor loadings exceeded the critical value
of >0.4 (Costello and Osborne, 2005). However, when
assessed as a single-item solution for the purposes of global
scoring, three of the four items belonging to the injury pain
and illness domain fell fractionally short of the >0.04 criti-
cal value. The single and three-dimension factor loadings
can be reviewed in Table 7. In order to contribute to
provisional insights into the responsiveness of the scale
(i.e. the ability for the measure to detect change over time),
known-groups validity was also re-assessed. The sample
sizes were unequal (programme start 74% and programme
completion 26%); therefore, a Games-Howell procedure
was used to assess the specificity variance. There was a sig-
nificant difference in mean total scores for the ER-QLS
total score (p
<
0.05), for mental and physical well-being
total score (p
<
0.05) and for physical and mental well-
being score (p
<
0.05). Differences in mean scores were
observed for injury pain and illness total scores at the start
and completion of the programme, although these differ-
ences were not significant (p=1.00, p<0.05).
Discussion
The fundamental aim of the current research was to respond
to the current shortfall in the consistent psychological eval-
uation of exercise referral schemes via the design and vali-
dation of a measure of life-quality that is particularly
sensitive and relevant to exercise referral settings. The
range of tools used and therefore the challenges of compar-
ing outcomes across schemes coupled with the lack of
measurement specificity were the key contributors to the
rationale for the development of the ER-QLS and the
psychometric properties of the scale would suggest that
the ER-QLS has the capacity to improve these practice- and
research-focussed challenges.
The primary purpose of a new scale has to be that it is
representative and relevant for the population for whom it
is intended. Therefore, the source of items is of critical
importance. No amount of statistical manipulation can
account for poorly chosen questions, and patients rather

than clinicians (or what is often termed as the `expert opin-
ion' approach to item generation) have been deemed as `an
excellent source of items'(Streiner and Norman, 2008: 18).
Items for the ER-QLS were generated from the reports of
exercise referral participants who had completed their ini-
tial 12weeks of exercise and were, therefore, in a favoura-
ble position to communicate their experience of exercise
with specific reference to perceptions of life-quality.
The psychometric procedures undertaken at scale level
mean that the reliability and the validity of the ER-QLS can
be expressed in a number of ways and have been presented
here. The internal consistency of the ER-QLS as a single
scale or three subscales, as assessed by Cronbach's alpha,
was good. The test­retest reliability at scale level suggests
that scores on the ER-QLS are stable over a 1-week period.
The construct validity of the ER-QLS was supported by
predicted correlations with the WHOQOL-BREF, the SEES
and also the known-groups component of construct valid-
ity, whereby people at the beginning of an exercise referral
programme displayed lower total QoL ratings than those at
the midpoint or end of the programme. This range of psy-
chometric assessments is comparable with other newly
developed QoL scales reported within the literature (e.g.
Skevington et al., 2004) and also reflects recommended
psychometric procedures for evaluating health-related
quality of life measures (Hays et al., 1993).
The sub-domain scores for mental and physical well-
being and also physical activity facilitators were lower for
starters than completers. However, no such differences were
observed for the injury pain and illness domain. This would
suggest that the ER-QLS is particularly sensitive to detect-
ing changes in perceived exercise-related life-quality that
are related to mental and physical health and also lifestyle
factors that facilitate PA. It is also plausible that pain and
injury could be associated with, or as a consequence of,
exercise and in this respect, it would not have been surpris-
ing to observe scores that would reflect a higher incidence
of pain and/or injury and therefore a lower perceived QoL
for this domain; however, this was not the case. Furthermore,
the injury pain and illness domain contains only four items
and these results should be viewed with caution until further
field work to assess the responsiveness of the scale is com-
pleted. The small number of items would also account for
the lower factor loadings of these items when assessed as a
single-factor solution for the purposes of global scoring
(Table 7). However, given that frequency of pain (0.39), fre-
quency of pain management (0.39) and frequency of illness
(0.37) are approaching the critical value of >0.4, it makes
much more practical sense to suggest that the ER-QLS be
scored both sub-dimensionally and globally. Additional
field testing that is already underway will contribute to fur-
ther understanding the scales performance in this way.
With respect to the acceptability of the ER-QLS, the fre-
quency of missing responses did not exceed the level of 4per
cent suggested by Fayers and Machin (2000) as an
acceptable level for QoL assessments. Data were missing
most frequently in response to levels of perceived confidence
regarding the use of gym equipment (n
=
8). It is likely that
this item was missed by some respondents because not all
those who completed the test measure were referred to a lei-
sure centre that required the use of gym equipment. Some
respondents were referred into group exercise classes or
swimming, for example. While the ER-QLS is intended for
use in settings whereby it is typical that those referred make
use of gym equipment, further field testing may indicate that
the ER-QLS has the capacity to be used more broadly and if
this is the case, this question may require an amendment to
reduce the potential for missing responses.
The ER-QLS is unique in that it represents the first
measure of life-quality to be designed specifically for exer-
cise referral. Angermeyer et al. (2001) have asserted that
generic QoL assessments, such as the EQ-5D, cannot
replace specific instruments which cover the characteristic
living conditions of a particular patient group. This view-
point perhaps explains why there are so many measures of
life-quality available that have been designed to focus upon
a specific population or disease state (e.g. Kolotkin et al.,
2001), and the ER-QLS is no exception.
At every phase of the current research, the ER-QLS was
designed with the assessment of exercise-related life-qual-
ity in mind. This body of work employed a patient-/client-
focussed approach to item generation. Consequently,
participants who were representative of the population for
whom the measure is intended have acted as the primary
source for shaping conceptual understandings of what indi-
cators represent exercise-related life-quality. Each phase of
scale construction and validation were purposefully tar-
geted towards establishing the final scale into a meaningful
measure of life-quality, and the structural analysis and
exploration of convergent validity have provided valuable
insights into the domains of life-quality that are particularly
relevant to the evaluation of exercise referral programmes,
namely, mental and physical well-being, injury pain and ill-
ness and physical activity facilitators.
In summary, these correlation analyses suggested that the
mental and physical well-being domain of the ER-QLS is
most closely aligned with those aspects of QoL assessed by
more generic measures (e.g. WHOQOL-BREF). However,
the ER-QLS offers added value and specificity because it is
likely that the wording of items within the mental and physi-
cal well-being domain will be more meaningful for respond-
ents as they specifically relate to exercise behaviour.
Convergent validity analysis also suggested that the
injury pain and illness and the physical activity facilitators
domains both target indices of life-quality that distinguish
theER-QLSscalefrommoregenericmeasures.Specifically,
convergent validity analysis suggested that the injury pain
and illness domain of the ER-QLS targets physical indica-
tors of life-quality and the physical activity facilitators
domain targets primarily physical but also psychological
10 Health Psychology Open 
and environmental aspects of life-quality. However, as
mentioned previously, the wording of items contained
within these domains results in a measure that is more
suited to exercise referral. For example, one of the items
grouped into the injury pain and illness domain asks, `How
much does any injury you may have prevent you from
being physically active?' One of the items grouped into the
physical activity facilitators domain asks, `How confident
are you that you can exercise in a leisure centre with mini-
mum support?'Therefore, the ER-QLS can measure aspects
of QoL that are beyond the scope of generic measures and
thus provide outcome measurement that is potentially more
successful in reflecting the concerns of those referred and
who implement exercise referral programmes.
Again, this is aligned with the aim of the development of
health-related QoL measures that target indicators particu-
larly relevant to the ill-health condition for which they have
been constructed (e.g. Doward et al., 2003; Las Hayas et al.,
2006); although it is worth noting that the measurement of
life-quality and health-related life-quality is a complex phe-
nomenon, and the experience of illness can further compli-
cate endeavours to capture these valuable data. The ER-QLS
is no exception to these challenges, particularly given that
the population for whom the scale is intended is likely to
present with a range of illnesses and co-morbidities as
reflected in the samples of participants used to validate the
measure. While the psychometric properties of the ER-QLS
would suggest that the scale can reliably measure exercise-
related QoL (as demonstrated through the test­retest analy-
sis), and that known-groups validity indicates that the scale
may also detect changes in QoL over time, it is not unusual
for the course of some illnesses to affect a person's ability to
maintain exercise and therefore contribute to improvements
in perceived life-quality. Furthermore, and as mentioned pre-
viously, there is also the possibility that for some health con-
ditions, an increase in PA could increase perceptions of pain
and discomfort, and this may be reflected in the global and
injury pain and illness sub-domain score of the ER-QLS.
Health and exercise practitioners have a growing inter-
est in capturing more holistic outcomes from varied inter-
ventions designed to tackle health inequalities and reduce
disease. Consequently, measures of life-quality have been
deemed as the `essence of healthcare'(Holmes, 2005: 493).
Alongside physiological indices, such measures have a key
role to play in monitoring health outcomes at the patient/
client level. However, generic QoL may be more difficult to
measure than disease- or population-specific QoL, espe-
cially given that there is little agreement regarding how to
define the term (e.g. Holmes, 2005; Hunt, 1997). While dis-
ease- or population-specific measures attempt to navigate
this difficulty, inadequate explanations of precisely what
these instruments measure, and the lack of any theoretical
or conceptual considerations, ultimately make the claims
regarding the specificity and sensitivity of these QoL meas-
ures difficult to understand.
The ER-QLS is a reliable and valid measure of exercise-
related life-quality that has been developed from a mixed
methodological research approach, which has included pur-
poseful phases of research to meet the overarching research
aim. A particular strength of the resultant scale is that it
responds directly to recent NICE (2014) guidance regard-
ing the necessity for schemes to monitor quality of life out-
comes and provides practitioners with a tool specifically
designed for this purpose. A 22-item scale means that it is
not overly burdensome on respondents or scheme person-
nel and has the capacity to be combined with additional
evaluative measures. However, a current limitation of the
scale is that until data are collected from a number of
schemes across the United Kingdom, which has started to
integrate the ER-QLS into practice, it is unknown what the
practical application and feasibility of the scale will be.
Feasibility considerations related to the integration of new
scales into practice are shared by all newly constructed
measures and these considerations will be addressed in fur-
ther field testing.
While the ER-QLS is intended to support psychological
outcome assessment, it is of critical importance that more
process-related factors are not overlooked. This is particu-
larly important given that exercise referral schemes are
essentially tasked with supporting changes in PAbehaviour.
For example, behaviour change counselling such as moti-
vational interviewing (Miller and Rollnick, 2012) and the
use of qualitative methods should be encouraged to contrib-
ute to supporting exercise and PA behaviour in the long-
term. The ER-QLS is intended to contribute to the ongoing
development of the evidence base for the broader impact of
exercise referral schemes. More specifically, the scale
responds to recent recommendations to include health-
related life-quality outcome measures within evaluation
protocols (NICE, 2014) but with the added value of rele-
vance, appropriateness and the capacity for consistency of
measurement across schemes globally.
