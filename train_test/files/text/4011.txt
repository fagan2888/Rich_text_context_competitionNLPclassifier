Introduction
Inflammation has been regarded as an essential immune
response for a malignant tumor and consists of 4 basic com-
ponents: inflammatory inducers, sensors, inflammatory
mediators, and target tissues.1 The role of endogenous and
exogenous inflammatory inducers in tumorigenesis of tis-
sue has become an important contributor to such pathologi-
cal lesions. Under long-term exposure or stimulation, the
acute inflammatory responses to an inflammatory trigger
can shift to a chronic one with nonresolving inflammation.2
In fact, this inflammation is not a primary cause of cancer,
it is an essential adaptive response that aims to restore
homeostasis and is also a significant contributor to their
pathogenesis. That is, continuous stimulation for this
homeostasis causes a microenvironment of unbalanced

Abstract
Background. Phyllanthus emblica L (PEL), a well-known medical plant, has been used in Asian countries for a long time. Increasing
evidence suggests that it can prevent the tumorigenesis of cancer associated with nonresolving inflammation. However, the
possible anti-inflammatory mechanism responsible for preventing tumorigenesis of precancerous lung lesions is not well
elucidated. Materials and methods. Male A/J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups with 10 mice in each group: (1) blank
group (saline), (2) benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] group, (3) and (4) B(a)P + PEL (5 g/kg/d, 10 g/kg/d, administered by gavage), (5)
B(a)P + celecoxib (30 mg/kg/d, administered by gavage). Nodes on the lung surface were observed and calculated. The
levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 were
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-), IL-1, miR-101, and Lin28B protein levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results.
PEL extract treatment significantly reduced the number of nodes on the lung surface and attenuated B(a)P-induced levels
of proinflammatory cytokines MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 in lung tissue. The protein expressions of COX-2 and HIF-
were significantly decreased by the treatment of PEL. In addition, both PEL extract and celecoxib markedly upregulate
the expression of miR-101 while downregulating IL-1 and Lin28B levels. Conclusion. Our study indicated that treatment
with PEL extract can not only protect the lung from inflammatory injury but effectively prevent precancerous lung lesions
through regulating the IL-1/miR-i101/Lin28B signaling pathway.

inflammatory mediators and cytokines such as cyclo-
oxygenase (COX-2), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interleukin (IL)-1
resulting in the pathogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of
tumor. Therefore, regulation of these mediators could
become effective therapy in inflammation-related cancer,
and treatment would be more efficient if the mechanism
responsible for the mediators regulating nonresolving
inflammation is elucidated.
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the lead-
ing cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.3 Evidence
suggest that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 is dramat-
ically elevated in the serum of patients with NSCLC. In
vitro studies indicated that IL-1 promoted the proliferation
and migration of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, IL-1
represses expression of a tumor inhibitor miR-101 through
regulating COX-2 and HIF-. Furthermore, the suppression
of miR-101 downregulates its efficient target Lin28B,
which is another critical mediator of tumor repression.4 A
recent study has reported that the IL-1/miR-101/Lin28B
pathway is a novel regulatory axis of pathogenic inflamma-
tory signaling in NSCLC.
Phyllanthus emblica L (PEL), commonly known as
amla, has been used extensively in Asian countries such as
India and Thailand, and collected in Chinese pharmaco-
poeia (2010). Phytochemical studies show that it is rich in
tannins, polyphenols, gallic acid, flavonoids, vitamin C,
and emblicol.5 It has been extensively used to treat various
diseases, especially aspects of inflammation such as pneu-
monia, hepatitis, and even cancer. There is a wealth of
information indicating that PEL incorporates both cancer-
preventive and antitumor properties.6 Sultana et al7 have
suggested that PEL extract shows strong chemopreventive
potential for hepatocarcinogenesis with combined activity
of the reported tannins and flavonoids through modulating
the detoxification armory and inhibiting the expression of
several cell proliferation markers.7 Progallin A from PEL
fruit induces apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma
BEL-7404 cells, which is related to G1/M and G2/M arrest,
and it exerts its apoptotic effect by upregulation of Bax
expression and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression.8
Corilagin, a major component of the phenolic family of
PEL, shows high biological activity against chromosome
alterations and DNA damage as well as anti-inflammatory
effects.9 In addition, PEL could significantly suppress pro-
inflammatory genes, including COX-2, iNOS, IL-16, and
IL-6.10,11 PEL extract also efficiently reduced TNF- and
IL-1 levels with immunomodulatory effects on NSAID-
induced ulcers.12 Reported outcomes have strongly sug-
gested that the anticarcinogenic activity of PEL might be
attributed to its anti-inflammatory property. However, no
research has been conducted to explore this relationship
between the anticarcinogenic effects and anti-inflammatory
properties of PEL. The aim of this study was to provide a
possible mechanism for the effect of PEL on benzo(a)
pyrene [B(a)P]-induced precancerous lung lesions related
to the regulation of the inflammatory signaling pathway.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
The dried fruit of PEL was collected from the actual area
where it is produced: Tibet, China. It was authenticated as
PEL by professor De-kang Wu from Nanjing University of
Chinese Medicine. B(a)P was offered by Sigma Chemical
Co (St Louis, MO). Macrophage inflammatory protein
(MIP-2), TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Key GEN
Biotech Co, Ltd (Nanjing, P R China). Antibodies of COX-
2, HIF-, IL-1, Lin28B, and miR-101 were obtained from
Boster (Wuhan P R China). Other chemicals were all
reagent grade.
Preparation of Plant Extracts
The dried fruit of PEL were ground into powder. The pow-
der (1 kg) was weighed and extracted with double-distilled
water (1000 mL) by reflux extraction for 1.5 hours every
time (2 times). Then, the extract was filtered to remove the
impurities and was concentrated in a rotary evaporator at
50°C under reduced pressure. The yields of dried residues
were 21.5%, and the sample was stored at 4°C. Finally, the
supernatant of the samples was filtered through a 0.45-µm
cellulose acetate membrane for Liquid chromatography
electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS) analysis. The
doses given to animals (5 and 10 g/kg/d) of distilled extract
of PEL were expressed as grams of the original dry materi-
als per kilogram body weight.
LC/ESI/MS/MS Analysis for PEL Components
The sample was separated with an Agilent C
18
column (4.6
mm × 250 mm, 5 µm) by Agilent 1100 series. The mobile
phase consisted of (A) water­acetic acid (100:2, v/v) and (B)
methanol using a gradient program of 95% to 85% (B) in 0 to
10 minutes, 85% to 75% (B) in 10 to 15 minutes, 75% to 70%
(B) in 15 to 30 minutes, 70% to 60% (B) in 30 to 50 minutes,
60% to 40% (B) in 50 to 70 minutes, 40% to 20% (B) in 70
to 90 minutes, and 20% to 10% (B) in 90 to 120 minutes. The
flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the column temperature was
maintained at 30°C. The detection wavelength was set at 280
nm. LC/MS/MS analysis was performed on Thermo Fisher
Scientific ion trap mass spectrometer, equipped with an elec-
trospray ionization (ESI) interface (Bremen, Germany). This
analysis was operated under negative-ion mode. The opti-
mized operating parameters were as follows: ion spray
Wang et al 507
voltage, 4 kV; nebulizer gas (GS1): 0.50 L/min; and curtain
gas (CUR): 0.15 L/min. The mass spectrometer was detected
over a range of 80 to 1500 in the full scan mode.
Animal Treatment
Healthy male A/J mice (18-22 g) at 8 weeks of age were
purchased from SLAC Experimental Animals Co, Ltd
(Shanghai, China). The animal experiment protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of
Chinese Medicine. First, mice were injected with corn oil
(0.2 mL) containing B(a)P 100 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Then,
the mice were divided into 5 groups randomly, with 10 mice
in each group, and they were administered for 24 consecu-
tive weeks: blank group, model group, PEL (5 and 10 g/
kg/d), and positive celecoxib (30 mg/kg/d) group. Blank
and model mice were treated orally with saline solution
(0.9%) by gavage administration each day. All the mice
were put to death by suffocation applying CO
2
gas after 24
weeks. Lung tissues of mice were fixed in Tellyesniczky's
solution (70% ethanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, and 5% for-
malin) overnight and stored in 70% ethanol. The lung sur-
face nodes were calculated by counting under a dissecting
microscope.
Determination of MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1
by ELISA Kits
Blood samples were collected before sacrifice via the orbital
sinus and centrifuged at 3500g at 4°C for 15 minutes, and
the supernatant was collected for analysis with ELISA kits.
The specific procedures were followed by the manufactur-
er's instructions (Key GEN Biotech Co, Ltd, Nanjing, P R
China). Finally, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax19.0, Molecular
Devices, USA). The levels of inflammatory cytokines MIP-
2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 were calculated according to the
standard curve.
Immunohistochemical Analysis
All the tissues from lung lobes were cut to 4-µm thickness
for further immunohistochemical analysis. Sections of par-
affin-embedded samples from mice were prepared follow-
ing the standard protocols. Briefly, sections were dewaxed
for 20 minutes at 60°C and incubated in citrate buffer (pH =
6.0) for 30 minutes at 100°C. Then, the sections were
washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) each
for 3 minutes and treated with 5% fetal bovine serum at
room temperature for 25 minutes. Primary antibodies anti-
COX-2 (1:200), anti-HIF- (1:200), anti-IL-1 (1:200),
anti-miR-101, and anti-Lin28B (1:200) were diluted for
application in the incubation of tissues, and the sections
were incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS,
the sections were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with the sec-
ondary antibodies and then stained with 3, 3-diaminobenzi-
dine. An optical microscope was used to take photographs
of slides.
Western Blotting Analysis
Lung tissues were collected from all 5 groups and washed
twice with ice-cold PBS. Sequentially, tissues were lysed for
35 minutes at 4°C with radio-immunoprecipitation assay, and
the lysates were obtained by centrifuging with 13000g for 15
minutes. The concentration of protein was quantified by the
BCA method according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Then, the equalized amounts of proteins from each sample
were resolved in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis) and transferred to a polyvinyli-
dene fluoride membrane. Additionally, membranes were
blocked with blocking buffer before being incubated over-
night with a 1:250 dilution of specific primary antibodies
COX-2 (1:400), HIF- (1:400), IL-1 (1:400), miR-101
(1:400), Lin28B (1:400), and -actin (1:400) at 4°C. Finally,
membranes were washed with tris-buffered saline and
TWEEN 20 4 times (10 minutes each time), and then chemo-
luminescence reagents were added for the visualization of the
protein bands. The quantification of proteins was analyzed.
All experiments were performed at least 3 times.
Statistical Analysis
Experimental data in each group were analyzed using SPSS
11.5 software. (IBM, Armonk, NY). Statistical analyses
were performed using a 1-way analysis of variance. P <.05
was considered to indicate a statistically significant differ-
ence. All values were presented as means ± SD.
Results
Identification of Chemical Components
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was conducted to identify PEL
compounds. Tannins, organic acids, and flavonoids of PEL
could be eluted under the proper conditions within 120 min-
utes. The peaks whose retention time ranges from 3 to 100
minutes might consist primarily of tannins, organic acids,
and flavonoids, compared with these reported data.
Furthermore, as is shown in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1,
according to fragment ion information, these compounds of
PEL were identified as chebulagic acid, gallic acid, chebu-
linic acid, mucic acid 2-O-gallate, corilagin, ellagic acid,
quercitrin-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucosylside,
rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, and wogonin. Our established
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS methods could make it possible for
experiments with replications.

PEL Extract Reduces Nodes on Lung Surface
Compared with the normal, the nodes on lung surface in A/J
mice were obviously increased by an induction of B(a)P
(P < .001). However, the number of nodes was reduced by
PEL extracts, especially by the treatment with a dose of 10
g/kg/d, compared with model group (P < .01 or P < .05;
Figure 3). Results showed that administration of PEL did
have a significant protective effect on lung tumorigenesis.
PEL Extract Reduces the Levels of Inflammatory
Cytokines
ELISA analyses for several proinflammatory mediators
were carried out. As shown in Figure 4, a remarkable
increase of MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 appears in the
model mice serum compared with the blank one (P < .001 or
P < .01). However, an evident decrease in these protein lev-
els could be observed by the treatment with celecoxib as
well as in the PEL extract group compared with B(a)P. In
addition, the high dosage of PEL extract (10 g/kg/d) could
significantly reverse the levels of these cytokines to normal
levels (P < .05 or P < .01). The results suggest that PEL
extract reducing the odds of precancerous lung lesion may
be related to the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines.
PEL Extract Downregulates the Expressions of
COX-2 and HIF-
As shown in Figure 5, COX-2 protein expression could be
markedly increased by treatment with B(a)P in vivo when
compared with that in the blank group (P < .001). However,
the treatment with celecoxib distinctly decreased the high
level of COX-2 protein (P < .001). High-dose (10 g/kg/d)
and low-dose (5 g/kg/d) PEL extracts also remarkably
downregulated COX-2 protein expression in vivo (P < .01).
Interestingly, the same tendency was seen in HIF- expres-
sion. This outcome indicated that PEL extract downregu-
lated the expressions in both COX-2 and HIF- factors and
also demonstrated that there is a certain link between these
2 vital mediators in tumor, which has been reported often.
Effects of PEL Extract on the IL-1/miR-101/
Lin28B Signaling Pathway
Evidence indicates that the IL-1/miR-101/Lin28B signal-
ing pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
NSCLC. Thus, Western blot analysis was conducted to
determine the expression of IL-1, miR-101, and Lin28B,
and it showed that celecoxib as well as PEL extract signifi-
cantly decreased the overexpression of IL-1 and Lin28B
compared with the blank group (Figure 6). Data indicated
that PEL extract might provide protection from precancer-
ous lung lesions through regulation of the IL-1/miR-101/
Lin28B signaling pathway.
Discussion
B(a)P, a procarcinogen, has been a complete carcinogen in
animal models during the whole process from tumor ini-
tiation to tumor promotion. Lung tumors generated by
B(a)P in mouse share many genetic, biochemical, and

histopathological characteristics similar to those observed
in human lung cancer.13 Thus, in this study, we established
the mouse model induced by B(a)P following recognized
principle.
Currently, lung cancer has been shown to be closely
associated with nonresolving inflammation in the process
of malignant transformation.3 Different phytochemicals of
PEL extract are reported to possess desirable cytotoxicity
against tumor cells and reverse the status of antioxidants to
normal level in cancer-bearing animals.14,15 They not only
supplement the conventional treatment that can act at almost
each step of carcinogenesis but offer better conditions with
minor side effects.5,13 In the present study, we explored the
primary chemical components, tannins, organic acids, and
flavonoids by implementing LC/MS/MS analysis. In gen-
eral, phenolic compounds of PELmay serve as potential herbal
candidates for amelioration of acute and chronic inflammation
because of the modulatory action of free radicals.16 The rutin
in PEL, which is a flavonoid, is known for its anti-inflam-
matory properties and can provide protective effects to the

pancreas.17 Compounds with a galloyl moiety showed
higher antiproliferative activity than the flavonoid and are
worth investigating as potential cancer chemopreventive
agents.18 Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is abundantly
present in PEL fruit, has the potential to shelter the body
from oxidative cascades leading to inflammatory injury.19
In addition to these constituents, other substances such as
chebulaginic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin are also

responsible for the multiple effects on every stage of carci-
nogenesis by serving as carcinogen inactivators, enzyme
inducers, and scavengers or antioxidants.
Continuous stimulus by inflammatory cytokines such as
IL-6 and TNF- may activate multiple signaling pathways.20
IL-6 secreted from the activated monocyte, macrophage, or
tumor cell is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine with dem-
onstrated tumor stimulatory and inhibitory properties.
Moreover, patients with increased IL-6 levels in advanced
metastatic cancer have poor prognosis.21,22 In addition, TNF-
 has multiple antitumor effects including lysis, hemor-
rhagic necrosis of tumor cells, and tissue damage through
adhesive molecules.23,24 It is also the primary inducer of
MIP-2, which mainly has chemotaxis effects on neutrophils
and involves inflammatory response. Furthermore, a signifi-
cant pathological feature in acute lung injury is that there are
a large number gathered, along with expression of MIP-2
mRNA, in lung tissue.25,26 In the present study, we found that
PEL significantly reduced the levels of TNF-, IL-6, and
MIP-2, which definitely alleviated the inflammation in acute
lung injury induced by B(a)P and could be the reason why
PEL helped restore the production of anti-inflammatory fac-
tors and prevented the formation of precancerous lung
lesions.
Almost all NSCLC preinvasive precursor lesions have
higher expression levels of COX-2 than normal lung
tissue.27,28 Thus, COX-2 has become an important target of
chemoprevention, and celecoxib is one of its inhibitors.
Besides, COX-2 can be dramatically upregulated by various
stimuli such as IL, TNF-, and other tumor promoters.29
Furthermore, because tumor cells lacking oxygen is a com-
mon phenomenon in solid tumors, HIF- is the primary
transcription factor that makes sure the organism adapts to
the hypoxic condition and is comprehensively involved in
metabolism as well as apoptosis of cells.30,31 It ensures nor-
mal function of the organism and cells under hypoxic

conditions and plays a critical role in tumor metastasis and
invasion because it promotes angiogenesis.32,33 Also, it is
directly regulated by COX-2 at the transcriptional level.
Our findings have shown that COX-2 and HIF- levels
increased significantly in B(a)P-induced mice, whereas
they were evidently decreased by treatment with PEL
extract; this means that PEL extract can protect normal
lung tissue from damage not only in protein expression of
COX-2 but at the transcriptional level.
IL-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with
chronic inflammation and is dramatically elevated in the
serum of NSCLC patients.34 A previous study suggested
that sustained induction of IL-1 can create an inflamma-
tory microenvironment to the advantage of tumor initiation
or metastasis.35 Moreover, IL-1 signaling acts to repress
microR-101, a well-known tumor-suppressive miRNA,
which is negatively regulated in lung cancer and repressed
by HIF- at the transcriptional level in prostate cancer
cells.36 Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 acti-
vates HIF- through the NF-kB/COX-2 pathway.37,38 More
important, Lin28 is an RNA-binding protein correlated with
tumorigenesis and tissue inflammatory response.39,40 It can
regulate the biogenesis of the let-7 family.41,42 Interestingly,
overexpression of let-7 significantly reduced IL-6 expres-
sion, which was measured to gauge the influence on
tumorigenesis of inflammatory factors.43,44 Overall, IL-1
upregulated Lin28B by downregulating miR-101, within
which the inhibition of COX-2 abrogated IL-1-mediated
repression of miR-101 and IL-1-mediated activation of
Lin28B along with their stimulatory effects on NSCLC cell
proliferation and migration. To investigate the anti-inflam-
matory mechanism responsible for preventing tumorigene-
sisofprecancerouslunglesions,weexaminedtheexpression
of IL-1, Lin28B, and miR-101. As expected, the results
showed that PEL extract effectively prevented precancerous
lung lesions by relieving the inflammatory response through
downregulating IL-1 and Lin28B expression and upregu-
lating the level of miR-101 as well as by inhibiting unfavor-
ableinflammatoryfactorsthatareinvolvedincarcinogenesis.
These findings suggest that PEL could inhibit the B(a)
P-induced precancerous lung lesion by alleviating inflam-
mation through regulating the IL-1/miR-101/Lin28B sig-
naling pathway and is, therefore, expected to be a promising
chemopreventive agent.
Although there was statistically significant alleviation of
malignant transformations in lungs after treatment with
PEL extract in vivo, we still believe that more in vitro
mechanism studies need to be done. There definitely exist
several inflammatory pathways leading to cancer, and these
roads connect with as well as affect each other closely.
Figure 6. Regulation of PEL on B(a)P-induced Lin28B, IL-1, and miR-101 in lung tissue. Western blotting was performed for Lin28B,
IL-1, and miR-101 protein expressions. Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3).
Abbreviations: PEL, Phyllanthus emblica L; B(a)P, benzo(a)pyrene; IL, interleukin.

Exploration of all the mysteries of the relationship between
chronic inflammation and cancer is definitely full of both
challenges and rewards.
Conclusion
PEL extract not only eliminates the risk of nonresolving
inflammation but also prevents precancerous lung lesions
by the IL-1 /miR-101/Lin28B signaling pathway. This
study underscores the potential benefits and applications of
PEL in controlling inflammation-related precancerous lung
lesions.
