Abstract
Critics claim that capital requirements can exacerbate credit cy-
cles by restricting lending in an economic downturn. The intro-
duction of Basel 2, in particular, has led to concerns that risk-
sensitive capital charges are highly correlated with the business
cycle. The Basel Committee is contemplating a revision of the Ba-
sel Accord by introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers. Others
claim that capital buffers are already large enough to absorb fluc-
tuations in credit risk. We address the question of the pro-cyclical
effects of capital requirements in a general framework which takes
into account banks' potential adjustment strategies. We develop
a dynamic model of bank lending behavior and simulate different
regulatory frameworks and macroeconomic scenarios. In particu-
lar, we address two related questions in our simulation study: How
do business fluctuations affect capital requirements and bank len-
ding? To what extent does the capital buffer absorb fluctuations
in the level of mimimum required capital?

Non-technical summary
As part of the reform of the Basel 2 framework ­ often referred to as Basel 3 ­ the
issue of how to dampen pro-cyclicality is under intense discussion. The debate focuses
on two types of measures: One approach is to smooth capital requirements and make
them less sensitive to volatile credit risk developments. Another approach is to require
banks to build up capital buffers during good times of the business cycle that can be
released in bad times. The paper addresses the question of whether a reform of the capital
framework is necessary as banks already hold significant capital buffers. These issues are
addressed using techniques from dynamic stochastic optimization in order to model a
bank's capital decisions. In the optimization problem, a bank's capital is the state variable,
while dividend payments and loan supply are the decision variables in each period. In the
model, capital is important because it restricts the scope for lending. In addition, the
bank incurs costs if it fails to meet the capital requirements.
Based on these modeling assumptions, the impact of changes in the prevailing macroeco-
nomic conditions and credit risk on banks' capital decisions is analyzed by distinguishing
between unexpected shocks and expected cyclical variations.
The main results can be summarized as follows:
· Even in the absence of capital regulation, banks hold a significant amount of capital.
In the restricted cases, the bank holds a capital buffer well above the minimum
capital requirements (both in Basel 1 and 2).
· The capital buffer does not mitigate the volatility of capital requirements under
the risk-sensitive capital framework of Basel 2. Minimum capital requirements and
actual capital are highly correlated. As a result lending under Basel 2 is significantly
more volatile.
· The impact strongly depends on whether or not the change in credit risk is unex-
pected. A sudden rise in credit risk may have a serious impact on loan supply. In
the case of expected changes, the effect hinges on the size of the interest margin. If
it is low, volatility in lending might be high.
Given these observations, both a smoothing of minimum required capital over the busi-
ness cycle and the introduction of capital buffers might be appropriate solutions from a
regulatory perspective. However, banks have a genuine incentive to hold capital cushions
on top of minimum required capital in order to avoid default through breaking regulatory
capital requirements. Therefore, mandatory regulatory buffers might be considered as an
additional capital requirement by banks as well as markets. Consequently, buffers have to
be defined in such a way that they can "breath" with the cycle: It has to be ensured that
they are build up in an expansion phase and can be drawn down during a recession. Fur-
thermore, when designing a capital buffer, regulators need to take account of behavioral
changes in the capital management processes of banks as a response to the introduction
of the risk-sensitive capital framework. According to our simulation results, bank lending
depends in a highly non-linear way on interest rates, PDs and other parameters that have
an impact on banks' expected profits. Therefore, the selection of macroeconomic variables
that control the size of the buffer poses a key challenge.

Bestandteil der gegenw¨

anderungen werden h¨
aufig auch als "Basel 3" bezeichnet ­ sind insbe-
sondere Maßnahmen zur D¨

unschter pro-zyklischer Wirkungsketten. Dabei
werden zwei verschiedene Mechanismen diskutiert: Zum einen wird die Gl¨

uber Schwankungen des Kreditrisikos zu mildern. Dar¨
uber hinaus soll die Einf¨

von dem die Banken im Abschwung zehren k¨
onnten. Das Papier er¨
ortert die Frage, inwie-
weit eine Korrektur der bestehenden Regeln notwendig ist, da die Banken ohnehin gr¨
oßere
Puffer halten. Hierbei werden mathematische Verfahren der dynamischen stochastischen
Optimierung angewendet, um die Entscheidungssituation der Banken abzubilden. Im be-
trachteten Optimierungsproblem bildet das Eigenkapital der Banken die Zustandsvaria-
ble, die Steuerungsvariablen sind die H¨
ohe der Dividenzahlung sowie der Kreditvergabe in
jeder Periode. Kapitalanforderungen sind in zweifacher Hinsicht bedeutsam: Erstens stel-
len sie eine Begrenzung der m¨
oglichen Kreditvergabe dar. Zweitens entstehen bankseitig
Kosten, falls die Bank durch Unterschreitung der regulatorischen Mindesteigenkapitalan-
forderungen ausf¨
allt.
Basierend auf diesen Modellannahmen wird der Einfluss des makro¨

felds untersucht. Dabei wird zwischen unerwarteten Schocks und erwarteten zyklischen
Schwankungen unterschieden.
Die Hauptergebnisse k¨
onnen wie folgt zusammengefasst werden:
· Selbst unter der Annahme, dass die Banken keinen regulatorischen Kapitalanforde-
rungen unterliegen, zeigen die Simulationen, dass Eigenkapital in beachtlicher H¨
ohe
vorgehalten wird. Bei G¨
ultigkeit von Basel 1- und Basel 2- Kapitalanforderungen
halten die Banken erhebliche Kapitalpuffer ¨
uber dem geforderten Minimum (sowohl
unter Basel 1 als auch Basel 2).
· Andererseits zeigt der Kapitalpuffer keine mildernde Wirkung hinsichtlich der
Schwankungen der Kreditvergabe. Aktuelles Eigenkapital und Mindesteigenkapital-
anforderungen sind stark miteinander korreliert. Folglich ist auch die Kreditvergabe
unter dem risikosensitiven Basel 2-Regelwerk wesentlich volatiler.
· Der Einfluss h¨
angt stark davon ab, ob die ¨
Anderungen des Kreditrisikos von den
Banken erwartet wurden, oder ob sie unerwartete Schocks darstellen. Ein pl¨
otzlicher
Anstieg h¨
atte unter Umst¨
anden deutliche Auswirkungen auf die Kreditvergabe. Bei
erwarteten ¨
Anderungen h¨
angt der Einfluss von der Zinsmarge ab. Ist diese niedrig,
so kann sich auch hier eine deutliche Volatilit¨
at der Kreditvergabe ergeben.
Diese Ergebnisse der Simulationen zeigen, dass sowohl die Gl¨
attung der Mindesteigenka-
pitalanforderungen als auch die Einf¨
uhrung eines Kapitalpuffers aus regulatorischer Sicht
angemessene Handlungsoptionen sind. Banken haben jedoch ein eigenes Interesse, einen
Kapitalpuffer zus¨
atzlich zum geforderten Minimum vorzuhalten, um zu verhindern, dass
eine Unterschreitung des Mindestlevels zum Bankausfall f¨
uhrt. Daher besteht die Gefahr,
dass verpflichtende regulatorische Puffer von Banken als auch vom Markt als zus¨
atzliche
Kapitalanforderungen verstanden werden. Folglich sind Kapitalpuffer so zu definieren,
dass sie mit dem Zyklus "atmen": Es muss sichergestellt sein, dass sie in Expansionspha-
sen aufgebaut werden, und ein Abbau w¨
ahrend Rezessionphasen m¨
oglich ist.
Regulatoren m¨
ussen bei der Ausgestaltung des Kapitalpuffers Verhaltensanpassungen im
internen Kapitalmanagement, die durch die Einf¨

regulierung bedingt sind, mit ber¨
ucksichtigen. Die vorliegenden Simulationen zeigen, dass
die Kreditvergabe stark nichtlinear von Kreditzinsen, Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten und
anderen Parametern, die einen Einfluss auf die Profitabilit¨

Daher stellt die Auswahl geeigneter Variablen f¨

A simulation study1
1 Introduction
In 2006, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision established a new framework
(BCBS, 2006) for capital measurement and capital standards, which has now been in-
troduced in many countries. It has replaced the capital framework of 1988, which had
been criticized for its inadequate risk weighting. Whereas, in the old framework, the
risk weights of financial assets were largely determined by asset class, in the new frame-
work they are a function of obligors' creditworthiness, as measured by their probability
of default (in the Internal Ratings Based approaches). On the other hand, as the mean
creditworthiness of debtors usually correlates with the business cycle, the new capital
requirements might give rise to regulatory induced volatility in capital holdings, and as a
result in lending. This might in turn aggravate economic downturns when banks have to
cut their lending in response to eroding capital buffers. This problem had been identified
even under the old framework, but with time-dependent risk weights, the pro-cyclical
effect of minimum capital requirements might have become more severe.
The recent financial crisis has brought the need to reform the Basel framework back onto
the international regulatory agenda (BCBS, 2009). The Basel Committee (BCBS, 2010)
now suggests counteracting cyclicality of existing capital requirements by including two
"macroprudential" buffers in the framework. The fixed buffer requires banks to retain
part of their earnings if capital falls under a certain level of capital. The time-varying
capital buffer links capital to the rate of growth in lending.
Critics claim that these measures tend to reduce the risk sensitivity of capital require-
ments and counteract the initial purpose of risk-sensitive capital requirements, namely to
improve the measurement of risk.
They purport that claims of pro-cyclical effects may be overstated as banks usually hold
a significant capital buffer on top of the required minimum. Thus, banks would simply
reduce their capital buffer when capital requirements increase. However, we argue that it is
not clear whether capital buffers mitigate the problem of cyclicality in lending or actually
make it worse if one takes banks' risk-return considerations fully into account. In order to
analyze the problem in greater detail, we present a model for a bank's optimizing behavior
under regulatory constraints. We also differentiate between expected and unexpected

changes in credit risk.
There is a large stream of literature that analyzes the cyclical effects of risk-sensitive
capital requirements. Catarineu-Rabell et al. (2006), Goodhart et al. (2006), and Kashyap
and Stein (2004) focus on the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the probabilities
of default and the magnitude of cyclical variations in minimum capital requirements. By
contrast, Estrella (2004) determines the optimal level of capital in the presence of capital
costs and costs of failure. He shows that minimum capital requirements based on Value
at Risk are likely to be pro-cyclical. Heid (2007) studies the effect of minimum capital
requirements in a macroeconomic framework and confirms the view that a risk-sensitive
capital framework is likely to be pro-cyclical but also that the capital buffer plays an
important role in mitigating capital-driven cyclicality in lending.
Our study is more closely related to several other studies which analyze capital require-
ments in a stochastic dynamic optimization framework. Zhu (2007) introduces an equi-
librium model in which banks maximize expected discounted dividend payments but are
constrained in their lending behavior by minimum capital requirements. Peura and Keppo
(2006) study banks optimal capital choice as a trade-off between the opportunity cost of
equity capital, the loss of franchise value following a regulatory minimum capital viola-
tion, and the cost of recapitalization. The assumed recapitalization results in a positive
probability of capital adequacy violation. Repullo and Suarez (2008), who model rela-
tionship banking with endogenous loan rates, find that capital buffers are counter-cyclical
under risk-insensitive capital requirements and pro-cyclical under risk-sensitive capital
requirements.
2 The framework
In our model, the representative bank generates interest income from a credit portfolio
that it funds with deposits and equity capital. Its objective is to maximize expected
discounted dividends net of capital costs. As equity capital is more costly than deposits,
the bank faces a trade-off between high profitability with low capital ratios and greater
solvency with higher capital ratios. In determining the optimal level of capital, it is
assumed that the bank can only build up capital by retaining earnings but cannot raise
new capital on the capital market. This assumption is made to keep the analysis tractable
as otherwise the degree of freedom in the bank's decision problem would become too large.
The bank's second decision parameter is its portfolio composition. In particular, it can
choose between bonds and loans. The former pay a safe interest rate r, while the latter
pay an interest rate of t
which exceeds r due to the loans' credit risk.
The bank enters period t with capital Ct
and customer deposits D. We assume the latter
to be fixed over time. As stated above, the bank determines its current dividend payments
2
dt
and its level of loans Lt
. The level of safe bonds in its portfolio is implicitly derived
from its budget constraint:
Ct
- dt
+ D = Lt
+ Bt
. (1)
All loans have an ex ante equal probability of default pt
, which may however vary over
time. By contrast, the loss given default given by LGD is fixed. The default correlation
is implicitly determined by the asset correlation .2 Vasicek (2002) showed that under
certain conditions the (random) default rate q converges to the following distribution:
q  F(x, p, ) = 

1 -  · -1(x) - -1(p)

1 - 
. (2)
The bank's (random) profit before dividend pay-outs in period t + 1 is given by
t+1
= r · (Ct
- dt
) + (t
- r) · Lt
- LGD · Lt
· drt+1
. (3)
Thus capital before dividend pay-outs is given by
Ct+1
= Ct
- dt
+ t+1
. (4)
The bank's balance sheets at t and t + 1 are depicted in Figure 1.

The (opportunity) costs of capital are equal to z per unit capital invested. We assume
that a bank's dividend pay-outs may not exceed its current level of equity capital. If
losses in the bank's loan portfolio deplete its capital and the bank becomes insolvent, it
will disappear from the market and capital once invested is lost. Summing up, the bank's
optimization problem reads as follows:

The target function (5) is defined as the discounted dividend payments net of capital
costs. The constraint (6) corresponds to the budget constraint (1), and (8) is the default

= 1

The bank's optimization problem is a stochastic dynamic system with state variable Ct
,
transition equation (8) and decision variables dt
and Lt
. Thus, the following Bellman
equation holds:
V (C) = max
(d,L)At

-

for all C. The sets At
include all feasible (d, L) as determined by the constraints (6) to
(9). The right hand side of equation (10) is split into two parts. The first term refers to
the case where the bank survives in the following period, whereas the second part reflects
the cost of default.
Minimum capital requirements, also referred to as MCRs throughout this paper, restrict
the bank's leverage and riskiness. Both fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs can be de-
scribed in terms of risk weighted assets (RWA), which are defined as the weighted average
of a bank's assets, where the risk weights are determined according to the perceived risk of
the particular asset. Under fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs, a bank's risk weighted
assets must not exceed a certain multiple of its capital, or, equivalently, the ratio of capital
to risk weighted assets (regulatory capital ratio) must exceed a certain threshold a, ie
C
RWA
 a. (11)
Under fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs, the threshold a is given by 8%. However,
fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs differ in the way risk weights are calculated. Under
fixed MCRs, risk weights are determined by the type of the respective asset, eg 100%
4
for loans, 20% for interbank exposures and 0% for OECD sovereign exposures. By con-
trast, under the Internal Ratings Based approaches, risk weights are determined by the
estimated probability of default and other risk parameters. For our model, we assume a
positive risk weight w for loans and a zero weight for riskless bonds for both fixed MCRs
and risk-sensitive MCRs. The regulatory requirement can therefore be rewritten as:
C
w · L
 a. (12)
In our model, we assume that regulatory requirements have to be fulfilled both at the be-
ginning and at the end of an investment period. The former imposes a binding restriction
on the choice of the bank's portfolio. The latter is of indirect nature. As a result of credit
risk, it is uncertain ex ante whether the bank will be able to meet capital requirements at
the end of the investment period when losses have materialized. However, we assume that
a bank that fails to meet regulatory requirements is closed down by regulators. Summing
up, the decision problem with regulatory requirements can be written as:

As in the unconstrained case, the second term reflects the cost of default, which occurs
in this case if the bank does not meet the minimum capital requirements.

3 Scenario analysis
In this paper we measure the pro-cyclicality of the bank's behavior in terms of its equity
capital, dividend payments, and lending. If the dynamic system is shocked, i.e. if one
assumes shocks in the exogenous variables, these will deviate from its long-term average.
Depending on the bank's characteristics and the general regulatory framework, the de-
viation might be modest, which would indicate mild pro-cyclical behavior, or large, in
which case it is strong. In our case, the key exogenous variable measuring the state of
the economy is the probability of creditors' default (PD). If the PD is low, the economy
is in good shape, and vice versa. We assess the dependence of capital and lending on
PDs by means of a scenario analysis. We study and compare the results of three different
settings:
(i) The unrestricted case: The bank is constrained by the insolvency condition but not
by any capital requirements.
(ii) The fixed MCR case: Risk weights are fixed over time for non-defaulted loans
(w = 1).
(iii) The risk-sensitive MCR case: Capital requirements depend on the bank's credit
risk, i.e. on PD.
In particular, for the risk-sensitive MCR case (BCBS, 2006, para 272)
w = LGD · 
-1(PD) + (PD) · -1(0.999)
1 - (PD)
- PD ·
1
1 - 1.5 · b(PD).
(20)
Note that this formula represents the risk weight function for corporate obligors.3
In the scenario analysis below, the return on equity is set to z = 10% and the riskless
rate to r = 4%. We further assume a loss given default of LGD = 45%, which is the rate
implicitly assumed in Basel 2's Foundation IRB approach.4 The correlation parameter is
set to  = 30%. Finally, the amount of deposits is assumed to be fixed over time and
normalized to D = 3.
Note that a rise in PDs has two effects. First, expected credit losses will be higher.
In particular, since a constant loss rate was assumed, the credit loss will be equal to
LGD · PD. Second, credit risk as measured by the deviation of the loss from its expected
value will change too. Usually this deviation ­ frequently called the unexpected loss ­ is
3In particular we assume a residual maturity of 2.5 years and the respective maturity adjustment
b(PD) = (0.11852 - 0.05478 · ln(PD))2.
4Under the Foundation IRB, banks are required to use their own estimates of the risk-parameter PD,
while LGDs and EADs are specified by the supervisory framework, eg LGD = 45% for unsecured loans.

measured by a suitable percentile of the normalized loss distribution. The bank will take
into account both the expected and the unexpected loss when determining its reaction to
a change in PDs.
In this regard, an important factor will be whether or not the bank had anticipated the
change in PDs. Unanticipated changes are likely to induce more abrupt shifts in lending
than anticipated ones. For instance, in the case of the latter the bank may build up
sufficient capital buffers in order to protect itself against unexpected losses in its credit
portfolio.
3.1 Unanticipated credit risk shocks
In this section we analyze the effects of an unanticipated shock to credit risk and capital.
We assume that the economy is in a stable equilibrium with no fluctuations in expected
credit risk.
In the following we compare three different regimes: the absence of any capital require-
ments, fixed capital requirements, and risk-sensitive capital requirements. In order to
ensure that the comparison of the latter two is not distorted by level effects, the long-
term level of borrowers' PD is set to 126bp. In this case, risk-sensitive risk weights
exactly match fixed risk weights ex ante. All future deviations (after the assumed shocks
to PDs) are thus the result of differences in the two frameworks' design and not because
of differences in the levels of initial capital.
As a result of this assumption, the lending policies for fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs
coincide. The same holds true for dividend policies. The policy functions are depicted as
solid lines in Figure 2. Clearly, they have a distinct, non-linear shape. The dividend policy
function remains flat and equal to zero up to a certain capital threshold. Thereafter it is
linearly upward sloping. By contrast, the loan policy is linearly upward sloping in the first
section, which ends at approximately the same level of capital as in the case of the dividend
policy, and flat thereafter. This suggests the following interpretation: For low levels of
(initial) capital, the bank primarily aims to build up its capital buffer through retained
earnings. It therefore refrains from paying out any dividends to its shareholders. Step
by step, however, and in line with capital accumulation, it increases its volume of loans.
For high levels of capital, the process reverses. Then dividend payments take priority and
surplus capital is paid out to shareholders. At the same time, the bank does not change
its volume of loans until a new equilibrium is reached, which is presumably somewhere
near the kink in the policy function. We determine the long-run level of capital and loans
by simulating the bank's investment and capital decisions. We start with a given value
of initial capital and simulate the subsequent development in random profits, capital,
dividends, and loan supply. Thus we generate a total of 200 independent random paths.
We take the capital after 20 periods as a realization of long-term capital, provided that
7
the bank neither became insolvent nor violated minimum capital requirements in the
preceding periods. The average of such values serves as the estimate for the expected
value of long-term capital in the subsequent analysis. The long-term values for capital as
well as for lending and dividend payments are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Overview: Long-term capital, loans, dividends

Capital 0.16 0.48 0.48
Dividend payments 0.06 0.08 0.08
Volume 3.0 3.4 3.4
All remaining fluctuations are random, resulting from random losses in the bank's loan
book. Importantly, as long as credit risk remains constant, those fluctuations are expected,
and there is no need for the bank to change its policies as opposed to the respective realized
levels of capital and lending in one particular point in time.
Before analyzing a shift in PDs, it is instructive to analyze an unanticipated reduction
in capital. This drop in capital may for instance result from extraordinary losses in
the bank's loan book. So we assume that the model bank incurs a drop in capital in
the amount of 5%, which roughly corresponds to the 90% quantile of the capital loss
distribution. From the policy functions we infer that in the unrestricted case the bank
reduces its dividend payments by 13% compared with its long-term average. Under fixed
MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs the shift is more pronounced, with dividend payments
falling by 30%. At the same time, one observes no reduction in lending. In other words,
even larger losses in capital do not affect lending. The situation would change, of course,
if we assumed very extreme losses in capital.
We now simulate a sudden and isolated one-time rise in the borrower's PD by 100%. As
a result, required regulatory capital under risk-sensitive MCRs rises by 22.5%. As risk
weights are fixed, the rise in credit risk has no effect on regulatory capital under fixed
MCRs. Note however, that it may still have a significant effect on desired capital as a
result of a change in the unexpected loss.
As above, we assume that the shock in credit risk is a one-time event and that credit
risk returns to its previous level thereafter. In contrast to the sudden shift in capital
discussed above, the bank will change its dividend and lending policies. Although it
did not anticipate the change in PDs, the old policies are no longer optimal against the
background of higher credit risk. It is easy to show that the optimization problem boils
down to solving a profit maximization problem in two periods. In particular, we denote
by V the value function derived from the solution with fixed PDs. Obviously, the optimal
policies after the PDs have returned to their long-term levels are those which are optimal

Table 2 summarizes the effects on dividend payments and loan volumes. For the unre-

ments are cut by nearly 30% in order to keep the loan-to-capital ratio constant in times
of higher expected losses. Under the regime with fixed capital requirements, the bank
moderately reduces its lending (by approximately 6%) when faced with higher PDs. The
reduction in dividend payments is significant, equalling nearly 20%. Under the regime
with risk-sensitive capital requirements, we observe a significant reduction of lending
(minus 21%). The drop in dividend payments is similar to the case with fixed capital
requirements.
Figure 3 shows the evolution of mean lending over time for the three regimes under
consideration (solid line). For the two scenarios with capital requirements, we added a
line that shows the maximum permitted loan volume under the respective capital regime
(dashed line). It is important to note, that the bank reduces its loan exposure although
it still has sufficient capital buffers that would allow it to lend more. Therefore, it is

not because capital requirements became a binding constraint that the bank reduces its
risk exposure. Rather it is the combination of stricter capital requirements, which makes
a default more likely, and bigger risks that induces the bank to reduce its credit risk
exposure.

3.2 Expected credit risk fluctuations
Having discussed unanticipated shocks in credit risk and capital, we now move to expected
fluctuations in PDs and profits. In order to do so, we incorporate a very simple model
of business fluctuations into our framework. In particular, we assume that the (relevant
10
part of the) macroeconomy is represented by the evolution of the mean probability of
default (PD). We take the assumed default correlation between individual borrowers at a
particular point in time and leave it at that. We assume that the underlying probability
distribution of the PD process is known to the bank. Therefore, to the extent that the
bank can predict the future state of the economy, it will be able to provision against
changes in mean credit risk.
It is assumed that the evolution of mean PDs follows a Markov process. The two states of
the economy, which we call Good and Bad, represent an upturn or respectively downturn
of the economy. The mean PD in each state is equal to pG
and pB
. The transition matrix
is given by
2
=
GG
GB
BG
BB
.
The Bellman equations for the corresponding dynamic optimization problem are as fol-
lows:
Vi
(C) = max
(d,L)At
{d - z · C +  · ii
· E[Vi
(C - d + i
)] +  · ij
· Vj
(C - d + j
)]}. (22)
In the scenario analysis below, we distinguish between two settings. In the "persistence"
scenario, we assume that the mean PD has the tendency to remain in a particular state.
In the "reversion" scenario we assume that the economy always reverts to the good state
relatively quickly.
Persistence scenario
For the persistence scenario, each state occurs with unconditional probability 0.5 and the
following symmetric transition matrix is assumed:
P
=
0.7 0.3
0.3 0.7
. (23)
As mentioned above, any fair assessment of risk-sensitive capital requirements should
abstract from pure level effects. However, with time-varying PDs, risk-sensitive capital
requirements necessarily vary over time. In the scenario analysis below, conditional PDs
are set such that on average risk-sensitive capital requirements and fixed capital require-
ments coincide. As was noted above, that holds true if unconditional PDs are equal to
0.0126. As the unconditional state probabilities are equal to 0.5, this constrains the choice

of conditional PDs implicitly by
0.5 · pGood
+ 0.5 · pBad
= 1.26%. (24)
To fully determine the conditional PDs, we assumed the difference in conditional PDs to be
one percentage point. This leaves us with PDs given by pGood
= 0.76% and pBad
= 1.76%.
For the loan interest rate, standard economic models predict that the spread over the
riskless rate should cover both expected loss and capital costs for unexpected losses.
Assuming a LGD of 45%, the expected loss is given by
EL = LGD · (0.5 · pGood
+ 0.5 · pBad
) = 0.63%. (25)
The unexpected losses are usually defined as some quantile of the loss distribution. In
our case we assumed the 99.99% quantile.5 Therefore, for the total spread we have
 - r = EL + z · UL = 2.81%. (26)
As a further robustness check, we assume an additional stress scenario. In a low interest
rate scenario the spread is set to 2.33%.
Figures 4 and 5 show the respective policy functions for the moderate and low interest
rate scenario. For moderate interest rates, the general pattern of the respective policy
functions for dividend payments and lending resembles those above for time-invariant PDs.
In particular for lending, it is upward sloping in the first part, up to a certain capital level,
and flat thereafter. Moreover, lending ­ and for that matter dividend payments ­ are lower
in the bad state than in the good state given a certain level of capital. All in all, however,
the policy functions for the good and bad state are fairly close.
The situation reverses for the low interest rate scenario. In this case, lending falls signifi-
cantly (for a given level of capital) when the economy moves from the good into the bad
state, at least if capital exceeds a certain threshold. Interestingly, the policy function for
dividend payments in the bad state is ­ from a certain capital threshold ­ above the one
for dividend payments in the good state.
In a second step, we simulated the behavior of banks with the aforementioned policy
functions. Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. For our key variables, such as loans,
capital and capital ratios, we determined the average value as well as the conditional
mean given a good or bad state of the economy. Results of Table 3 show that dividend
payments are approximately 40% higher in good times compared to bad times under fixed
MCRs. For risk-sensitive MCRs the difference is even bigger and approximately equals
69%. As a result, the difference in capital levels for the respective states of the economy is
5Often a lower p-value is assumed. The higher level accounts for additional liquidity risk, which is not
explicitly modelled here.

small. With regard to lending, the difference is negligible. Moving to a scenario with lower
interest rates, the differences between good and bad states become more pronounced, in
particular with regard to lending.
Some interesting observations can be made with regard to the leverage ratio, which has
received considerable regulatory attention recently: First, under both regulatory regimes
this ratio is higher in the good state than in the bad state. Second, as expected, the
difference in the leverage ratios of the good and the bad state is bigger under risk-sensitive
MCRs than under fixed MCRs. Third, under both regimes, leverage is much lower than
under the unregulated system. Fourth, the unregulated system is much more cyclical ­
as measured by the difference between leverage ratios in the good and bad state ­ than
both regulated systems.
Reversion scenario
In the reversion scenario we simulate an economy which is more often in the good state
than in the bad state. Moreover, once the economy is in the bad state it is likely to revert
to the good state in the following period.
To simulate this setting, we assume the following transition matrix:
R
=
0.7 0.3
0.7 0.3
. (27)
The transition matrix is symmetric, which means that the (conditional) probability of
moving to a particular state, e.g. the bad state, does not depend on the current state of
the economy. The loan interest rate, which is assumed to be constant, is determined in a
similar fashion as above. For the high interest rate sub-scenario we chose  = 7.09% and
 = 6.43% for the low interest rate scenario.
The policy functions for the two scenarios are depicted in figures 6 and 7. Since the
conditional probabilities do not depend on the current state, the (conditional) policy
functions for the good and the bad state coincide, unlike in the persistence scenario. As
was the case for the persistence scenario, we find the same strong non-linear pattern for
the low interest rate scenario. As policies do not vary between good and bad states of
the economy, any fluctuations in the conditional means of loans and dividends is purely
the result of different loss distributions for each state. In particular, expected losses are
higher in the bad state than in the good state. However, the variation in lending and
dividends are very small (Tables 5 and 6). We do not discuss the results for the high
interest scenario here, which are similar.
Table 7 compares the findings for fixed and risk-sensitive capital requirements. As ex-
15
pected, lending is more volatile under the latter than under the former. The degree of
volatility depends largely on the level of expected earnings. If the loan interest rate is
high, volatility is negligible whereas if it is low, volatility can become very significant.
This holds true even for the reversion scenario where policies for the good and bad state
are equal. Obviously, the degree of volatility results less from a change in policies than
from the sensitivity, for a given policy, of lending with regard to the level of capital. The
results also show that capital buffers partially absorb the volatility in minimum capital
requirements as shown by the high degree of correlation.
4 Conclusion
This paper aims to explain the evolution of capital and capital buffers over time and com-
pares different regulatory frameworks (fixed MCRs, risk-sensitive MCRs and the absence
of any regulatory capital framework). The general framework uses models of stochastic
dynamic optimization in order to study banks' adjustment strategies vis a vis changes
in macroeconomic conditions. The model can explain the presence of substantial capital
buffers on top of required holdings. The model predicts that banks will reduce lending
and cut dividend payments during economic downturns even if they still hold sufficient
capital buffers to meet capital requirements. Importantly, large capital buffers do not
necessarily mitigate the problem of cyclicality: Minimum required and actual capital of-
ten move in sync. The drop in lending is more pronounced if the random shock to PDs
is unexpected. However, even if they are expected ­ in the sense that banks know their
probability distribution ­ cyclicality can be significant, in particular if interest margins
are relatively small.
The findings suggest that the problem of cyclicality in the current Basel framework does
indeed need to be addressed. However, there might be no easy way to fix the problem,
as any change in regulatory measures will provoke an adaptive reaction. Making capital
requirements less cyclical might not necessarily mean that actual lending becomes less
volatile. In designing new macro-prudential instruments, it is therefore essential to take
into account the reaction function of financial intermediaries.
