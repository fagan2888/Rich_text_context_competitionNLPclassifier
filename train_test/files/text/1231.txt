ABSTRACT
Previous studies among elderly suggest an association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether moderate CKD is associated
with cognitive performance among young, healthy, ethnically diverse adults. Three computerized cog-
nitive function tests of visual-motor reaction time (Simple Reaction Time), visual attention (Symbol Digit
Substitution), and learning/concentration (Serial Digit Learning) were administered to a random sample
of participants, aged 20 to 59 yr, who completed initial interviews and medical examination in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Participants for this study (n  4849)
completed at least one cognitive function test. GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Moderate CKD was defined as estimated GFR (eGFR) 30 to 59 ml/min
per 1.73 m2. Unadjusted, residual-adjusted, and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models were
used. The cohort was 49.0% male and 11.6% black, and median (interquartile range) age was 36 yr (27
to 45) and eGFR was 107.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (95.0 to 125.4). There were 31 (0.8%) prevalent cases of
moderate CKD. Models were adjusted for residual effects of age, gender, race, diabetes, and other
known potential confounders. In multivariate models, moderate CKD was not significantly associated
with reaction time but was significantly associated with poorer learning/concentration (odds ratio 2.41;
95% confidence interval 1.30 to 5.63) and impairment in visual attention (odds ratio 2.74; 95% confidence
interval 1.01 to 7.40). In summary, among those in a large nationally representative sample of healthy,
ethnically diverse 20- to 59-yr-old adults, moderate CKD, reflected by eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
was significantly associated with poorer performance in visual attention and learning/concentration.

High rates of cognitive impairment and dementia
have been reported in many but not all studies of
patients with ESRD.1­7 Factors that may contribute
to cognitive impairment in those with ESRD in-
clude a high prevalence of traditional cardiovascu-
lar risk factors that cause subclinical damage and
uremia and its associated metabolic disturbances.8
Increased risk for stroke9 and carotid atherosclero-
sis10,11 among those with ESRD may also predispose
them to cognitive impairment.
Many of the same factors that are proposed as
contributors to cognitive impairment in patients
with ESRD are also observed, although to a lesser
degree, in patients with moderate kidney impair-
ment.12­14 Furthermore, several recent studies have
reported an association between both dementia and
cognitive impairment and moderate kidney dys-
function.15­17 For example, Seliger et al.15 found el-

creased risk for dementia among elderly individuals. Chronic
kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated GFR (eGFR)
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, was found to be associated with
cognitive impairment among the elderly17 and among meno-
pausal women with coronary artery disease.16 These studies,
however, were conducted in elderly cohorts with comorbid
conditions and little ethnic diversity; therefore, they were not
completely generalizable to the 7.4 million estimated Ameri-
cans with moderate CKD (eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73
m2).18 The goal of this study, therefore, was to examine the
association between moderate CKD and cognitive function us-
ing cross-sectional data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a representa-
tive sample of the US population. The cognitive function tests
were administered to a random half-sample of 20- to 59-yr-
olds who completed the initial interview and medical exami-
nation.
RESULTS
Among the 4849 individuals who participated in at least one of
the NHANES III cognitive tests, 31 (0.8%) had moderate CKD
(eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2). This represents approx-
imately 1 million Americans between the ages of 20 and 59 yr.
Table 1 presents participant characteristics for those with and
without CKD and for the entire sample. Median age of the
participants was 36 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 27 to 45).
Men constituted 49.0% of the cohort, and 11.6% were black.

moderate CKD were more likely to be older; have higher sys-
tolic and diastolic BP; be hypertensive; have higher total serum
cholesterol; have higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN), body
mass index, C-reactive protein, and albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio; and have lower HDL. Those with moderate CKD were less
likely to be black and consume one or more alcoholic drinks
per week. There were no significant differences in comorbid
conditions, education, or cardiovascular disease between the
eGFR groups (Table 1).
Unadjusted mean cognitive function test scores by eGFR
category are presented in Table 2. All three cognitive test scores
showed significantly poorer performance (longer reaction
time/more errors) for those with moderate CKD.
Moderate Kidney Impairment and Cognitive Function
Scores on each of the three cognitive function variables were
not normally distributed. No transformation made it possible
to satisfy the normality assumption for linear regression; there-
fore, cognitive function variables were categorized into quar-
tiles. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess
whether eGFR predicted the "abnormal" quartile (defined as
the quartile with the longest reaction time) compared with the
remaining three quartiles with and without adjustment for
other covariates.
Simple Reaction Time Test.
Among the 4721 individuals in this study sample, 27 had mod-
erate CKD. Median age was 36 yr (IQR 27 to 44), 49.2% were
male, 11.0% were black, and 2.8% had diabetes. Scores on the
Simple Reaction Time Test (SRTT) ranged from 154.0 to 209.1
milliseconds in the shortest reaction time (first) quartile, 209.1
to 228.7 milliseconds in the second quartile, 228.7 to 255.5
milliseconds in the third quartile, and 255.6 to 660.0 millisec-
onds in the longest reaction time ("abnormal") quartile. There
was no statistically significant association between scoring in
the longest reaction time ("abnormal") quartile of the SRTT
and moderate CKD on unadjusted, residual analysis, or mul-
tivariable analysis (Table 3).
Symbol Digit Substitution Test.
Among the 4865 individuals in this study sample, 27 (0.6%)
had moderate CKD. Median age was 36 yr (IQR 27 to 44),
49.1% were male, 10.9% were black, and 2.8% had diabetes.
Scores on the Symbol Digit Substitution Test (SDST) ranged
from 1.38 to 2.29 seconds for the shortest reaction time (first)
quartile, 2.30 to 2.66 seconds for the second quartile, 2.67 to
3.15 seconds for the third quartile, and 3.16 to 22.2 seconds for
the longest reaction time ("abnormal") quartile. Odds for
scoring in the longest reaction time ("abnormal") quartile of
the SDST were significantly associated with moderate CKD
(P  0.01) in the unadjusted model. Odds ratios (OR) re-
mained statistically significant for poorer performance on
SDST in multivariate analysis, although the association was
attenuated (P  0.05; Table 4).
Serial Digit Learning Test.
Among the 4676 individuals in this study sample, 30 (0.6%)
had moderate CKD. Median age was 36 yr (IQR 27 to 45),
49.3% were male, 10.8% were black, and 4.8% had diabetes.
Scores on the Serial Digit Learning Test (SDLT) ranged from
zero to one total error committed during the trials for the
smallest number of errors (first) quartile, two to three errors
committed for the second quartile, five to nine errors commit-
ted for the third quartile, and 10 to 16 total errors committed
during the trials for the largest number of errors ("abnormal")
quartile. OR indicate a significant association of scoring in the

with moderate CKD in unadjusted and multivariate models
(P  0.02 and 0.04, respectively), although multivariate adjust-
ment attenuated the association (Table 5).
There were no statistically significant interactions of eGFR
with any covariate for all models tested.
Sensitivity Analysis
To determine whether the presence of diabetes may have bi-
ased the observed association between eGFR and cognitive
function, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in a low-risk sub-
set of individual without diabetes. Among the 4512 individuals
who did not have diabetes and were in the SRTT study sample,
25 had moderate CKD. There remained no statistically signif-
icant association between SRTT and eGFR multivariable anal-
ysis, and point estimates remained similar (OR 0.68; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.92; P  0.46) to that of the full
cohort.
Among the 4481 individuals who did not have diabetes and
were in the SDST study sample, 25 had an eGFR 60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2. The association between moderate CKD and cog-
nition was slightly attenuated from that of the full cohort (OR
2.59; 95% CI 0.94 to 7.18) and of borderline significance in a
multivariate model (P  0.06).
Among the 4373 individuals who did not have diabetes and
were in the SDLT study sample, 25 had CKD. Although the
association between eGFR remained in the same positive di-
rection, with the smaller number of outcome event and com-
mensurate lower statistical power, it was attenuated from that
of the full cohort and was no longer statistically significant (OR
1.64; 95% CI 0.56 to 4.81; P  0.36).
Although microalbuminuria (dichotomized at gender-
specific cut points) was significantly associated with SDST
in an unadjusted model (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.26), the
association did not reach statistical significance in an ad-
justed model (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.71). No other
statistically significant associations were found between
SRTT or SDLT and microalbuminuria in unadjusted or ad-
justed models.
DISCUSSION
In a random sample of NHANES III participants who were
aged 20 to 59 yr and were administered three computerized
tests to evaluate cognitive functioning, moderate CKD, as re-
flected by eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2, was associated
with poor cognitive function in two of the three tests: SDST
and SDLT. Furthermore, these associations were independent
of the residual effects of age, race, gender, diabetes, and other
factors that are known to confound the association between
CKD and cognitive function.
Previous studies of cognitive impairment and kidney dis-
ease reported similar results.1,5,8,15­17 However, because many
cohorts in previous studies were elderly, had ESRD, and lacked
ethnic diversity, any direct comparison should be made with
caution.

National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) also reported no
significant differences on the Choice Reaction Time test (a
measure of psychomotor speed). The NCDS randomly as-
signed hemodialysis patients to either a low or high BUN target
level with either long or short dialysis time. Cognitive function
was examined as part of the study. No differences in reaction
time between those with high or low BUN levels were found,
although electroencephalogram abnormalities were noted in
the high BUN group.19
Also similar to findings reported here, Seliger et al.15 found
moderate kidney insufficiency, defined as an elevated serum
creatinine, to be associated with a 37% increased risk for de-
mentia among community-dwelling individuals who were 65
yr and older and participating in the Cardiovascular Health
Cognition Study. In the same study, kidney function analyzed
as a continuous variable was associated with a 26% increased
risk for dementia.
In a cross-sectional study of primarily white postmeno-
pausal women who had established coronary artery disease and
participated in the Heart Estrogen/Progestin Study, Kurella et
al.16 found low eGFR significantly associated with impaired
global cognitive function, executive function, language, and
memory. The association was independent of residual effects
of age and race and other confounding variables.
Also consistent with results reported here, Kurella et al.17
showed that an eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was associated
with cognitive impairment in a cohort of Medicare-eligible
individuals who participated in the Health, Aging and Body
Composition Study. The risk for cognitive impairment was
greater for those with lower eGFR.
Biologic mechanisms for the observed association between
moderate kidney impairment and cognitive function cannot
be determined by this study and are likely multifactorial. Tra-
ditional vascular risk factors that are associated with cognitive
impairment in the general population, such as age, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and dyslipidemia,20­22 are often more prevalent
amongthosewithCKD.Theseriskfactorsforstrokemayaccount
for decreased cognitive function through subclinical damage to
the central nervous system (CNS). Results presented here, how-
ever, suggest that cognitive impairment was independent of these
factors in an otherwise healthy adult population.
Another explanation for the association between kidney
and cognitive dysfunction is the accumulation of solutes. This
explanation would suggest a potentially reversible cause, mak-
ing this explanation tantalizing. A recent small study of pa-
tients who were on nocturnal hemodialysis revealed improve-
ments in cognitive function after initiation of nocturnal
dialysis, suggesting a reversible cause to the impaired cognitive
function.23 Other studies suggested that elevated plasma ho-
mocysteine levels may also be a potential vascular risk factor
for dementia and cardiovascular disease in the general popu-
lation.24­27 Elevated homocysteine is present in 85% of dialysis
patients8 and also common among those with moderate
CKD.28 Increased oxidative stress and cognitive impairment
have been seen in the general population26 and are also associ-
ated with CKD.28
This study has a number of limitations. Because only
three cognitive function tests were administered as part of
NHANES III, this study cannot provide a comprehensive
cognitive assessment of moderate kidney impairment and
cognitive function across the full range of cognitive func-
tion. One of the three cognitive tests in this study (SRTT)
did not have consistent results with the other two tests.
However, the null findings were consistent with those of
other investigators, suggesting that the difference with the
other tests may be related to the distinct cognitive domain
assessed by the SRTT that might not be related to kidney
impairment. Direct comparison with other tests of cogni-
tive function is also not possible. Another limitation is that
there was an overall test nonresponse rate of 9%. Nonre-
sponse rates increased with age, decreased with educational
level, were higher for men, and were lower for non-Hispanic
white individual than other ethnic groups.29 Although it is
impossible to determine whether eGFR status had any in-
fluence on nonresponse, it is possible that nonresponse
rates may have introduced some bias into the study.
Most known correlates of kidney impairment were ad-
justed for in these analyses. However, other confounders,
such as vascular disease, which we could not adjust for in
these analyses, might also explain these results. Plasma ho-
mocysteine was measured on a small subset of the NHANES
III cohort during the second laboratory examination and
therefore not suitable for inclusion in this analysis. In addi-
tion, parathyroid hormone levels, often elevated in those
with CKD, were not measured in NHANES III and could
not be adjusted for in these analyses. Furthermore, although
this study found an association between cognitive function
and moderate CKD, the cross-sectional nature of the study
makes it impossible to suggest any inferences as to the cause
of the observed findings.
There was a relatively small number (0.8%) with CKD in
this younger, relatively healthy sample, which limited the abil-
ity to perform subgroup analyses. The small number of indi-
viduals with moderate CKD made it impossible to stratify by
National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Qual-
ity Initiative (KDOQI)-defined eGFR categories to assess
whether there was a threshold effect. Also, caution should be
taken when assuming a relationship between moderate CKD
and cognition because of the low prevalence of CKD. None-
theless, even with the low prevalence of CKD, the statistical
significance at an  of 0.05 was observed.
Despite the limitations, our study has several strengths.
They include the large, nationally representative, educationally
and ethnically diverse sample of healthy 20- to 59-yr-olds. The
extensive laboratory data and extensive medical history data
collected using standardized methods of NHANES III allowed

CONCLUSION
Moderate CKD, as reflected by an eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per
1.73 m2, was significantly associated with poorer performance
in visual attention, learning, and concentration in a large, na-
tionally representative sample of healthy, ethnically diverse 20-
to 59-yr-olds. These findings provide an important extension
to the existing literature on older adults with CKD, and adults
with ESRD and may provide important insights into the early
development of cognitive impairment that predate comorbid
conditions that are prevalent in the elderly and those with
more advanced kidney disease.
CONCISE METHODS
Participants
NHANES III was conducted at 89 survey locations between 1988 and
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. This national survey of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized US population aged 2 mo and older used a com-
plex, stratified, multistage probability design with oversampling
among individuals who were 60 yr of age, non-Hispanic black, and
Mexican American to enhance the precision among these groups. The
survey was designed to obtain nationally representative information
on the health and nutritional status of the US population by means of
interview and physical examination.30,31 CNS (cognitive) function
evaluation was administered to a random half-sample of NHANES III
examinees who were aged 20 to 59 yr and participated in the mobile
component of the NHANES III examination (n  5662). Cognitive
tests were systematically administered to those with odd-numbered
survey identification numbers. Cognitive testing was not adminis-
tered to those who could not speak English or Spanish or to those who
were legally blind.29
Cognitive Function Testing and Definition of
Outcomes
Three computerized tests were administered to evaluate cognitive
functioning. The tests were components of the Neurobehavioral Eval-
uation System 2, a system of neurobehavioral tests that were developed
by Baker and Letz32,33 and are used in epidemiologic studies. Trained
technicians administered all cognitive tests using a standardized pro-
tocol in both English and Spanish. Each test was preceded by a prac-
tice phase.
The SRTT is a measure of visual-motor speed, or response time,
measured in milliseconds. Participants were instructed to press a but-
ton as quickly as possible when a solid square appeared in the center of
a blank computer screen. A total of 50 trials were administered. The
SRTT was scored as the average reaction time, excluding the first 10
trials. NHANES III has determined a reaction time 750 or 50
milliseconds to be invalid. Furthermore, individuals with mean scores
representing 20 trials are considered invalid by NHANES III.29,34
The SDST is a test of coding ability and visual attention. A set of
nine symbols is matched to the digits one through nine. The partici-
pant is shown a series of symbols and must match the symbol with the
correct corresponding digit as quickly as possible. A total of four trials
were conducted with a different pairing of digits and symbols. The
SDST was scored as the average total time, in seconds (s), for comple-
tion of the four trials.29,32­34
The SDLT is a test of learning recall and concentration. Partici-
pants were presented with a series of digits displayed on a computer
screen, one at a time, for 6 seconds, with a 6-second interval between
digits. Once all digits were displayed, participants were required to
enter the entire sequence on the keyboard in the order in which they
were presented. Testing stopped when participants responded cor-
rectly on two consecutive trials or after a total of eight trials. The SDLT
was scored as the sum of the errors committed during the trials.29,32­34
Estimation of Kidney Function
GFR, an estimate of kidney function was estimated (eGFR) using the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, which is
based on baseline age, gender, race, and serum creatinine concentra-
tion.35 Serum creatinine measurements were calibrated to the Cleve-
land Clinic laboratory by subtracting 0.23 mg/dl.36 eGFR was dichot-
omized using a threshold value of 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to
define moderate CKD. This threshold was chosen on the basis of
current National Kidney Foundation guidelines defining CKD.37 Mi-
croalbuminuria was defined by gender-specific cut points using 17
g/mg for men and 25 g/mg for women.37
Covariates
Variables that were known or hypothesized to be associated with cog-
nitive function, CKD, or both were chosen from the NHANES III data
files. Demographic variables including age, gender, and self-reported
race (coded as non-Hispanic black [black] versus others), educational
level (12 yr), medication use (use of blood glucose regulators, anti-
depressants, lipid-lowering medication, antihypertensive medication,
or drugs that effect the CNS), smoking status (current or nonsmoker),
ethanol use (one or more drinks per week), and self-reported current
health status (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor) were ascer-
tained by in-person questionnaire. Physical activity was categorized as
having any leisure-time activity during the past month as well as the
self-reported total metabolic equivalents expended during the past
month. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all cardiovascu-
lar disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or congestive heart
failure) was ascertained by self-report. Socioeconomic status was di-
chotomized at 200% federal poverty level ("poor or near poor")
using methods similar to those described by Martins et al.38
Physical measures including systolic and diastolic BP, height, and
weight were obtained during physical examination. Body mass index
was calculated as kg/m2. Participants were considered hypertensive
when they reported having been told by a doctor that they had high
BP, reported taking antihypertensive medication, or had an average
BP 140/90 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose
126 mg/dl, a self-report of diabetes, or self-report the use of blood
glucose regulators. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a total cholesterol
240 mg/dl or self-report of taking lipid-lowering medication. Lab-
oratory measures including serum creatinine (mg/dl), total choles-
terol (mg/dl), HDL (mg/dl), BUN (mg/dl), hematocrit (%), urinary

albumin (g/min), and urinary creatinine (mg/d) were obtained dur-
ing laboratory examination.
Study Sample
Individuals were excluded from this study when they reported
taking antidepressants, when the examining physician found evi-
dence of disabling impairment that prevented them from comply-
ing with the examination, when they had invalid (SRTT) or miss-
ing (because of nonresponse) test results, when they had an eGFR
30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or when they were missing values for
serum creatinine. A total of 5662 individuals were administered
cognitive function tests. Of these, 5308 had serum creatinine val-
ues (93.7%). Cognitive function test scores for individuals with
missing serum creatinine values did not differ significantly from
those who were included in the study sample. Similarly, serum
creatinine and eGFR did not significantly differ between those with
complete data and those with invalid or missing test results (data
not shown). Nonresponse rates varied by test; therefore, the num-
ber who completed each test is not uniform.29 After the exclusions
described, the study sample for the SRTT consisted of 4721 partic-
ipants, the study sample for the SDST consisted of 4965 partici-
pant, and the study sample for the SDLT consisted of 4956 partic-
ipant (Figure 1).
Statistical Analyses
A cross-sectional analysis was performed to examine the association
between moderate CKD and cognitive function. Bivariate associa-
tions with dichotomized eGFR and those who participated in any of
the cognitive function examinations were assessed with Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests and 2 for continuous and categorical variables, re-
spectively. Median (IQR) was reported for continuous variables. Pro-
portions were reported for categorical variables.
Each cognitive function test was modeled individually. Model-build-
ing strategy followed that of previous studies that examined the associa-
tion of eGFR and cognitive function.16,17 A priori, it was decided that
linear regression would be used to model cognitive function and eGFR.
However, should a cognitive function variable not be normally distrib-
uted, then transformations of the variable would be attempted to satisfy
the normality assumption. If transformations could not satisfy the nor-
mality assumption, then the results would be categorized into quartiles,
becausetherewerenoestablishedcutpointsforthesetests.16 The"abnor-
mal" quartile is defined as the quartile with the longest reaction time
(SRTT and SDST) or the quartile with the largest number of errors
(SDLT).Logisticregressionwasusedtocomparethe"abnormal"quartile
with the remaining three quartiles. Because of the known association
between diabetes and cognitive impairment,39 it was decided, a priori, to
include diabetes in all multivariable models.

Initial unadjusted models included the cognitive test as the depen-
dent variable and eGFR. Next, models were adjusted for the residual
effects of variables in the MDRD formula (age, gender, and race).16,17
Finally, best-fit, or parsimonious, multivariable models were fit using
a P  0.05 as criterion for inclusion. Covariates that were considered
for inclusion included all those previously mentioned. In addition,
any variable that was found to change the  coefficient of eGFR 10%
was included in the model. Interaction product terms with eGFR and
each covariate were created and separately tested in the multivariable
model including the main effects terms. Sensitivity analysis was per-
formed in a lower risk subset by excluding those with diabetes.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE 9.2 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX). All analyses for proportions and regres-
sion analyses incorporated the cognitive function sample weights to
accommodate the complex sample survey design. For all analyses,
P values are two-tailed with an of 0.05 considered for statistical
significance.
