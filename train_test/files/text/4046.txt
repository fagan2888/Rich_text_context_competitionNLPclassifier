Introduction
Race scholarship1 has been particularly enlightened by
political empowerment, a topic that is an important area of
research (Bobo and Gilliam, 1990) as well as an essential
feature of racial politics itself (Perry, 2013). How scholars
perceive African-American political life is investigated in
the seminal works of Walton et al. (1995) and Walton (1997,
Chapter 4). Empowerment, in their formulation, is about
symbolism: when Blacks move politically--or when moves
are made against them--what do race scholars observe (and,
by extension, write about)? To answer these questions, the
authors examine over 100 years of publications in the disci-
pline's oldest and most prestigious journals, Political
Science Quarterly (PSQ) and the American Political Science
Review (APSR), respectively, and they uncover a scholarly
viewpoint split into two camps: a side that treasures Black
empowerment; and one that does not. They name the side
that treasures empowerment "African American Politics"
(AAP); the other side of the coin is dubbed "Race Relations
Politics" (RRP). Walton et al. (1995) acknowledge that RRP
authors making Black­White comparisons can do so on
behalf of racial subjugation or acquiescence--for instance,
by holding Whites up as standard bearers, blaming Blacks
for delayed racial progress (or overemphasizing the impor-
tance of White benevolence in ameliorating race problems),
advocating strategies for uplift that do not upset the status
quo (and might even reinforce hierarchies), and so on.
Likewise, Walton (1997) reminds readers that conversations
about empowerment are often linked to demands for Black
liberation: publications in the AAP tradition can celebrate
Black life, point out the inadequacy of mainstream efforts
for racial progress, and champion strategies that advance the
race.2
Say our name (and say it right)! Extending
Walton et al. on the evolution of race in
political science scholarship

Abstract
To explore the evolution of political-science research on race, Walton et al., have done a systematic review of more than
a century of publications appearing in the discipline's oldest and most prestigious journals: Political Science Quarterly and the
American Political Science Review, respectively. Walton and his colleagues uncover "dual traditions" of race scholarship: an
"African American Politics" (AAP) paradigm emphasizing empowerment and Blacks' cultural distinctiveness, and a "Race
Relations Politics" (RRP) approach that focuses on Blacks' socio-political status vis-à-vis Whites. Using computer-assisted
text analyses, we introduce a measure of racial dialogue that is informed by theory and has suitable empirical properties.
We replicate and extend Walton's research by adding a third periodical (the Journal of Politics) and demonstrating that,
while race conversations are becoming more frequent over time, the dialogues taking place in mainstream journals
typically fit Walton's RRP (rather than AAP) tradition. Following our analyses, we offer guidelines for researchers seeking
to apply our measure to alternative contexts.

Research Article
2 Research and Politics 
Walton and his colleagues offer an artful analysis based
on nuances in language and theory. We generalize from the
authors' meta-study, making the process by which publica-
tions are deemed AAP or RRP transparent for readers.
Specifically, we characterize political-science race research
as a process by which authors "say Blacks' name" (making
African Americans prevalent in the document) and "say
Blacks' name right" (by striking a favorable tone when dis-
cussing this group of citizens). Combined, prevalence and
tone help us to analyze the centrality of race to our disci-
pline's discourse. By building an instrument that gets at
what Walton and his colleagues observe, we re-analyze
their corpus of text in novel ways and apply our instrument
to current articles in top-tier political science journals. This
replication-and-extension confirms not only that ours and
Walton's operationalizations are empirically comparable
but also that the former can serve as a proxy for the
latter when reviewing the race literature. Consistent with
McClerking and Walton (2010), we discovered that race
conversations are becoming more frequent over time, but
the dialogues taking place in mainstream journals typically
fit Walton's RRP (rather than AAP) paradigm.
Saying Blacks' name, and saying their
name right
Walton et al. lay a rich foundation for studying the evolution
of race politics scholarship. Philpot and White (2010: 5­6)
summarize the logic of Walton's "dual traditions" argument:
Two major research veins have appeared in the study of
African American politics--a race-relations [politics]
literature, which focuses on African Americans' place in
American political culture vis-à-vis Whites, and an African-
American politics literature whose emphasis is more on
political empowerment and cultural distinctiveness.
Walton's concept of interest is the centrality of conversa-
tions about race. Implied in this notion of centrality are
considerations of both the prevalence and tone of racial dia-
logue: authors can prioritize or de-emphasize discussing
race, and those conversations can be uplifting or denigrat-
ing in connotation. Beyond merely mentioning Blacks by
name, papers from the AAP tradition also say the right
things about African Americans by characterizing them in a
complimentary manner. Centrality is perhaps too narrow to
encompass the full scope of empowerment and its accom-
panying challenges. But the concept is adequate for explor-
ing how/why some scholars mention African Americans
"vis-à-vis Whites" in their writing while others promote the
edification of Black life.
To assess prevalence, Walton et al. ask: when race is
being discussed, are the political empowerment and/or cul-
tural distinctiveness of African Americans a central feature
of the publication? To capture more variation, prevalence is
best conceived of as a continuum. Therefore, we ask: when
race is being talked about in a publication, how central a
topic is political empowerment and/or cultural distinctive-
ness? Documents can refer exclusively toAfrican-American
empowerment, they could never mention it, or they may fall
anywhere between these extremes. We operationalize the
prevalence component of our centrality index as the per-
centage of a document's in-group racial references

Prevalence is typically measured by tallying documents'
references to the in-group ("Blacks" and its various syno-
nyms). The rationale is that larger tallies signal a stronger
commitment among authors to having race dialogues
(Alexander-Floyd, 2014;Wilson, 1985;Wilson and Frasure,
2007). The denominator, often implied by this approach, is
a paper's total word count. We propose a more relevant
denominator. The portion of the formula in square brackets
calculates the percentage of in-group mentions relative to
other race words, defined here as allusions to both the in-
group and out-group (derivations of the term "Whites").
For example, a paper with six in-group mentions out of 100
total words is referring to Blacks 6% of the time. Assuming
the document contains 10 race words, it is more useful to
know that African Americans make up 60% of the racial
dialogue and 40% of that conversation is about Whites.
One weakness of our prevalence measure is that it can
yield false positives. Papers that mentionAfricanAmericans
frequently, while making few references to Whites, could
be discussing racial subjugation rather than uplift. The
authors' prevalence score could still classify the document
as AAP, but a study about subjugation would be incompat-
ible with that scholarly tradition;3 therefore, we address this
issue by considering a document's "tone." Linguistic psy-
chologists infer tone by comparing the frequency of posi-
tive-affect and negative-affect words (Kahn et al., 2007;
Pennebaker et al., 2015a; Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010).
Following this precedent, we conceive of centrality as a
function of prevalence, weighted by tone. The weighting
variable (located to the left of the square brackets) is struc-
tured so that higher values suggest a tone that is more
favorable toward Blacks. Our centrality index, therefore,
generates a "weighted percentage" in which papers focus-
ing primarily on Blacks (i.e. earning higher marks for prev-
alence), while criticizing this racial group (receiving lower
values for tone), get reduced centrality scores.
Analysis and discussion
Walton replication
We collect data from JSTOR, an online archive of
scholarly writings. Our timeframe (1885­1990) covers the
McClerking and Block 3
period analyzed by Walton et al., and we include the same
54 publications the authors analyzed.4 Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC), an automated text-mining pro-
gram, scans documents for patterns in word use, punctua-
tion, etc. (Pennebaker et al., 2015b). LIWC extracts tone
metrics by matching a document's text to a pre-compiled
"dictionary" of terms representing positive and negative
emotions (Pennebaker et al., 2015a).5 We re-scale tone to
range from zero to one, with higher values indicating an
upbeat writing style, and texts with lower values feature
words connoting anxiety, sadness, or hostility. As noted
earlier, prevalence gauges the in-group racial references in
a paper. LIWC's default dictionaries do not follow race
words, so we customized our own search routine (Appendix
2). We multiply prevalence and tone to create our index of
centrality. The average centrality score is 28.43, with a
range from 2.99 to 54.63 and a standard deviation of 13.58.
So a typical article among the 54 is less than one-third of
the way up the scale, and only 3.70% of those papers are
above 50% on this measure.
We adopt the authors' typology for distinguishing RRP
and AAP papers, and readers should consult the reference
lists in Walton et al. (1995: Appendix 1) for details. As
Figure 1 shows, publications with centrality scores at the
higher end of the scale are likely to fall within the AAP
tradition, and papers scoring at the lower end are often clas-
sified as RRP. The horizontal axis divides scores into cut-
points: the lower threshold ranges from the minimum value
to 15%, which is approximately one standard deviation
below the mean (28.43%­13.58%  15%). The upper
threshold contains values that are at least a standard devia-
tion above the mean (28.43% + 13.58%  42%), and the
middle threshold captures scores between 15% and 42%.
The vertical axis records the proportion of publications
meeting these thresholds, while grey (black) bars distin-
guish RRP (AAP) papers. If "greater than 42%" of the
weighted race words refer to Blacks, then nearly 8 of 10
articles fulfilling these criteria are AAP, and less than one-
quarter of these documents are RRP. The inverse of this
pattern emerges when the cut-point is "less than 15%:"
nearly 9 of every 10 publications are RRP, while 1 in 10
papers areAAP. It makes sense that articles with the highest
centrality scores meet the AAP standard, and that publica-
tions with lower scores are overrepresented in the RRP cat-
egory. More importantly, while noting the limits of his
admittedly rigid classification system, Walton (1997: 61)
concedes that RRP and AAP papers can overlap. Our con-
tinuous measure addresses this challenge by allowing for
finer gradations of centrality levels.
Scholarly attention paid to Blacks often reflects water-
shed racial events. Given the timeframe covered here, there
is no event more pertinent than the Modern Civil Rights
Movement--hereafter referred to simply as the "Civil
Rights Movement"--which is viewed by many historians
as having occurred between 1955 and 1968 (Smith, 1996).
Following McClerking and Philpot (2008), we classify arti-
cles published before 1956 as appearing before the height
of the Civil Rights Movement, and the papers coming after-
ward should be shaped by these events. Like Walton (1997:
Table 4.3), we trace racial discourse over time and across
journals. Figure 2 contains separate scatterplots for each
journal. The vertical axes record the average centrality
level, while horizontal axes track the decades covered
(1890 through 1990 for PSQ, and 1900 to 1990 for APSR).
Each dot signifies a mean score for that particular decade,
and its size is proportionate to the number of papers pub-
lished during that period. Vertical dashed lines distinguish
articles written before and after 1956. Mean-difference
tests show that centrality levels in the APSR tend not to
vary with time (before 1956: mean = 29.26%; after 1956:
mean = 24.77%; F = 0.44, p > 0.05). There is more contrast
in the "before" (mean = 35.37%) and "after" (mean =
27.60%) scores in the PSQ, but the difference is non-signif-
icant (F = 2.28, p > 0.10). Although centrality does not
change much over time, papers about race become more
numerous after the Civil Rights Movement. As the size dis-
parity in the dots before and after 1956 illustrate, the aver-
age frequency of race papers per decade rises from 4.38 to
12.53 in the APSR (F = 15.89, p = < 0.01), and from 3.91 to
11 in PSQ (F = 20.14, p < 0.01).
Extension analyses
Aside from its distribution resembling that of Walton's, our
index exhibits construct validity (Cronbach and Meehl,
1955) because centrality correlates in predictable ways
with other variables. We now assess centrality's robustness
by: (a) expanding our viewpoint with articles from a third

score thresholds, sorted by scholarly tradition.

general-interest journal; and (b) extending the time span
from the 1990s to 2015. Like APSR and PSQ, the Journal of
Politics (JOP) is a leading periodical whose editors and
reviewers serve as research "gatekeepers" (Mohammadreza
et al., 2003). JOP is published by the Southern Political
ScienceAssociation. Given the widely-documented connec-
tion between southern politics and racial identity6 adding
JOP helps us to compare race discourse across mainstream
journals of similar pedigree while also exploring such dia-
logue in an outlet that is known for showcasing identity-
based research (for a similar justification, see McClerking
and Walton 2010). We supplemented JSTOR searches with
scans of journals' online archives (Appendix 2) to locate
151 additional articles: 35 more from APSR, an extra 15
from PSQ, and 101 from JOP. This new dataset merges the
"replication" and "extension" stages of data collection and
containsatotalsampleof205papers(TableA1inAppendix).
Centrality levels in the extension dataset concentrate
along the bottom two-fifths of the scale. These scores have
a mean of 21.73%, and minimum and maximum scores of
0.92% and 57.94%. Compared to the average of 28.43% for
the papers appearing in Walton's study, articles from our
updated collection tend to get lower scores (F = 10.14,
p < 0.01). But the variability in these scores are similar
across datasets: the standard deviations for the replication
and extension studies were 13.16 and 13.58, respectively,
and an equality of variance test shows that these difference
are non-significant (f = 0.94, p > 0.10). In Figure 3, we
illustrate the distribution of centrality scores in the exten-
sion dataset using kernel density plots. The horizontal
axis contains placeholders for every possible score that
publications can earn, while the vertical axis records how
frequently such scores appear in the data. Most publica-
tions fall within the 13% to 35% range. Documents that get
centrality scores of 40% or higher are rare, as are papers
scoring 10% or lower. The look of these distributions var-
ies; this is particularly true for the bimodal appearance of
the JOP scores. That said racial dialogues are empirically

similar across journals. Mean-difference tests confirm that
the centrality scores of papers appearing in the APSR
(22.57%), JOP (22.59%), and PSQ (27.05%) are compara-
ble (F = 1.83, p > 0.10), and equality-of-variance tests show
that the standard deviations for these journals (12.30%,
14.06%, and 13.89%, respectively) are similar.7
The organization of information in Figure 4 is similar to
that of Figure 2, and the results across both sets of analyses are
largely consistent. Using bivariate correlation to explore
changes in average centrality levels by decade and between
journals, we see that there is no statistically-significant time
trend in the centrality scores of papers from the APSR
(r = 0.22, p > 0.05).Yet, centrality decreased significantly over
time in the JOP (r = -0.33, p < 0.01) and PSQ (r = -0.29,
p = 0.06), which suggests that publications befitting Walton's
RRP tradition are becoming increasingly more common in
these journals. Judging from the fluctuations in the sizes of the
dots, we see that, regardless of journal, the number of articles
focusing on race has been increasing (APSR: r = 0.72, p <
0.01; JOP: r = 0.49, p < 0.01; PSQ: r = 0.88, p < 0.01). Overall,
dialogues about race in these top-tier journals have become
more frequent (measured as the number of publications),
while the focus on Blacks within these dialogues (operational-
ized by our centrality index) has declined in two of the three
journals analyzed here.
The above findings are clearer when we explore central-
ity scores and publication frequencies across racial periods.
Mean difference tests of publication frequencies demon-
strate that, compared to the pre-Civil Rights Movement era,
the APSR (F = 61.03, p < 0.01), JOP (F = 16.88, p < 0.01),
and PSQ (F = 44.22, p < 0.01) featured more race research
after 1956. Although references to African Americans in the
text of articles appearing in the APSR (F = 2.8, p > 0.05) and
JOP (F = 0.62, p > 0.05) did not change much after the Civil
Rights Movement, the centrality of racial dialogue in PSQ
articles swelled significantly (F = 6.01, p < 0.05).Additional
analyses (not shown) comparing racial dialogues before and
after 2008 suggest an "Obama effect." While it is not the
case for the APSR (F = 1.71, p > 0.05), evidence from the
JOP (F = 13.62, p < 0.05) and PSQ (F = 8.80, p < 0.05)
reveals that articles written after Obama declared his presi-
dential candidacy get higher centrality scores than those
published before 2008. Moreover, race papers are signifi-
cantly more common in the JOP (F = 3.09, p = 0.06) and
PSQ after 2008 (F = 3.09, p < 0.05), but there is less evi-
dence of an Obama-induced increase in the frequency of
race papers being published in the APSR (F = 0.09, p >
0.10). We explore these and related patterns in Figure A1 of
the Appendix.8
Conclusion
Political-science discourse draws its inspiration from real-
world events. Walton and his colleagues argue that the key
variable in the study of race politics research is the cen-
trality of empowering and/or culturally-distinctive dia-
logues within broader conversations about group relations.
In their comprehensive literature review, the authors
explore the distribution of racial centrality, as well as its
correlates, in publications from two flagship journals.
Following this lead, we introduce a theoretically-grounded
measure of racial centrality. Our analyses capture some
aspects of what Walton et al. (1995) discuss, and,
given the necessity of replication (King 1995), it is

6 Research and Politics 
encouraging--but hardly surprising--that Walton's work
not only stands the test of time but also holds up to rigor-
ous re-examination. We hope that others will expand upon
the work Walton started, for our approach lends itself to
an exploration of race dialogue in other political science
journals, and, ultimately, to comparative analyses (not
unlike Wilson, 1985) that chronicle discourse in other
social-science and humanities disciplines. Although we
focus on African Americans here, we recognize that
insights from our work might inform analyses of the evo-
lution of ethnic (e.g. Latino and Asian), gender, and sexu-
ality politics scholarship.
Economists distinguish between "positive" and "nor-
mative" research, characterizing the former as data-driven
and the latter as value-based. RRP papers are often con-
sidered to be positive political science, while AAP publi-
cations are billed as normative works. Admittedly, the
distinction between positive and normative is unclear,
reflecting social hierarchies and academic norms (see
Caplin and Schotte, 2008). Students of Black politics will
agree that the work of eminent scholars like Mack Jones,
Ron Walters, Jewel Prestage, Nick Nelson and Linda Faye
Williams, are just as much about advancing knowledge as
they are about racial advocacy. By revisiting Walton's
work, we hope to enliven the ongoing conversation about
race in American politics, and we invite others to join in.

Notes
1. A sample of this literature includes Dawson and Cohen
(2002), Hutchings and Valentino (2004), McClain and Garcia
(1993), Prestage (1979), Rich (2007), and Wilson (1985).
2. Walton et al. (1995) classified articles in Political Science
Quarterly (PSQ) (see Bugbee, 1898a, b; Curtin, 1968;
McClendon, 1933; Morris, 1960; Phillips, 1905, 1907)
and the American Political Science Review (APSR) (e.g.,
Meier and England, 1984; Rose, 1906; Stephenson, 1906,
1909) that defended racial segregation as "Race Relations
Politics". Examples of "African American Politics" articles
include Lewis (1933), Robinson (1982), and Smith (1981) in
the PSQ, and Allen et al. (1989), Bobo and Gilliam (1990),
and Gosnell (1934) in the APSR; these articles "addressed
the issue of African-American political empowerment in a
positive manner" (Walton et al., 1995: 158).
3. These documents say Blacks'name but do so while justifying
racial segregation (see Brooks, 1911; Weiss, 1969 for exam-
ples) and/or discouraging northerners from meddling in the
affairs of their southern neighbors (e.g., Langdon, 1891: 42).
4. Walton et al. (1995: 149) choose articles and presidential
addresses because they represent "two particularly impor-
tant forms of disciplinary expression." Since the peer-review
demands for major journals are often more rigorous than the
process for publishing political-science books, articles serve
as ideal barometers of [mainstream] disciplinary norms
(McClerking and Philpot, 2008: 814).
5. Tone is a summary variable derived from a proprietary algo-
rithm based on previously-published work (references to
the relevant papers appear in Pennebaker et al., 2015a. The
dictionaries of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count have
been re-calibrated multiple times over the past decade, and
the tone index in particular has a high level of reliability (see
Pennebaker et al., 2015a for details).
6. Since Key (1949) wrote his seminal book, political science
has been fascinated with race and southern politics. For a
recent review of this vast literature, see Kourser (2010).
7. Because they require pairwise comparisons, we run separate
equality-of-variance tests for the American Political Science
Review (APSR) vs. Journal of Politics (JOP) (f = 0.77, p >
0.10), the JOP vs. Political Science Quarterly (PSQ) (f = 1.02,
p > 0.10), and the APSR vs. PSQ (f = 0.78, p > 0.10).
8. We estimate the following regression model, where x con-
tains all predictors, y is the dependent variable, coefficients
for each predictor () result from minimizing the prediction
error (), and the functional form is linear so that, for text n,
the predicted value of yn

x
Past research informs what predictors we include in x (see
Table A2 in the Appendix for details). Specifically, we
control for text-level factors like pronoun use and verb
tense. Pronoun choice reveals subtle information about
writers (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007; Pennebaker, 2013;
Pennebaker and Davis 2006). For example, openness to
diversity is inversely related to the prevalence of first-
person singular pronouns, so we expect centrality scores
to drop with an increase in singular pronouns ("I," "me"),
and increase with a rise in plural pronouns ("we," "them").
The causal mechanism underlying this expectation merges
insights from social categorization theory with recent
McClerking and Block 7
research in linguistic psychology. In-group identification
and out-group bias can shape one's choice of personal and
impersonal pronouns, respectively (Sexton and Helmrich,
2000). Intergroup dynamics help to explain why some writ-
ers use objective-sounding language to distance themselves
from their topic of study, while others prefer a writing style
that connotes empathy when discussing race. Cramer and
Schuman (1975) and Di (2013) make similar arguments in
their research on pronoun use and racial attitudes. We also
account for concentrations of past, present, and future tense
verbs (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010), owing in part to the
tendency of racially-conservative scholarship to betray a
sense of nostalgia (Lavelle, 2015) or present-focus (Eibach
and Keegan, 2006), and for anti-racists to emphasize the pos-
sibilities--if not the eventuality--of fairer group relations
(Hochschild and Rogers, 1999). We analyze journal-level
effects by including dummy variables for the American
Political Science Review (APSR), and Journal of Politics
(JOP) (Political Science Quarterly (PSQ) is the reference
category). To judge society-level influences, we run sepa-
rate regressions for three racial periods: the pre-Civil Rights
Movement (1894­1956); post-Civil Rights Movement
(1956­2008), and Obama (2008­2015) eras. Publication
year is a proxy for "momentum," for centrality scores might
wax, wane, or hold steady over time.
Figure A1 in the Appendix illustrates the impact of text-,
journal-, and societal- level factors on racial discourse.
Coefficients are the predicted change, ceteris paribus, in aver-
age centrality scores associated with a one-unit increase in a
predictor. The squares, triangles, and circles display results
for the pre-1956, 1956­2008, and post-2008 periods, respec-
tively. The horizontal lines extending from these symbols are
95% confidence intervals, and estimates with intervals that
overlap with zero (marked by a dashed vertical line) are sta-
tistically non-significant. The pronoun use variables move in
the expected direction. All the singular pronoun coefficients
are negative in sign, and statistically meaningful for the
first two periods (pre-1956:  = -8.68, CI = [­13.3, -4.36];
1956­2008:  = -4.61, CI = [-8.70,­0.52]). Plural pronouns
do not predict centrality. An AQ's tendency to write in past
(9.90 [0.68, 19.1]) and present (5.20 [0.64, 9.75]) tense cor-
relates positively with centrality scores before 1956, but this
effect disappears in later periods. Future-tense verb use, while
consistently positive, gains explanatory power after the Civil
Rights Movement (6.30 [0.27, 12.90]) and into the Obama
era (6.79 [1.28, 12.3]). Pre-Obama-era centrality levels are
similar across journals. This pattern changes after 2008: com-
pared to PSQ, the APSR (15.3 [2.73, 27.90]) and JOP (8.59
[0.14, 17.01]) tended to publish papers with higher central-
ity scores. Finally, there is little evidence of a "momentum
effect": regardless of period, publication year is statistically
non-significant. To summarize, the results in Figure A1 of
the Appendix demonstrate that aspects of a paper's text, fea-
tures of the publication outlet, and the broader complexities
of group relations can influence scholarly discourse on race.
