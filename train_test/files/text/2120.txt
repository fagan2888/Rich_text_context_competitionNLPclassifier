ABSTRACT
Background: The association between blood homocysteine con-
centration and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains
controversial, but few studies have examined the association be-
tween MTHFR C677T (a proxy for high homocysteine concentra-
tion) and death from CVD.
Objective: The objective was to examine associations of MTHFR
C677T, a proxy for high homocysteine concentrations, with CVD
mortality and with all-cause mortality in a national representative
prospective cohort of the US adult population before the introduc-
tion of mandatory folic acid fortification of flour.
Design: We used Mendelian randomization to examine the associa-
tion of MTHFR C677T with cause-specific mortality in 5925 partic-
ipants by accessing the NHANES III (1991­1994) Linked Mortality
File (through 2006).
Results: A comparison of homozygotes at baseline showed that
individuals with a TT genotype had a 2.2-lmol/L higher homocys-
teine and a 1.4-ng/mL lower folate concentration, respectively, than
did those with a CC genotype. The TT genotype frequency varied
from 1.2% (95% CI: 0.7, 2.0) in non-Hispanic blacks and 11.6%
(95% CI: 9.6, 14.0) in non-Hispanic whites to 19.4% (95% CI: 16.7,
22.3) in Mexican Americans. After adjustment for ethnic group and
other CVD risk factors, the MTHFR C677T TT genotype was asso-
ciated with significantly lower CVD mortality (HR: 0.69; 95% CI:
0.50, 0. 95) but had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (HR:
0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.05). After stratification by period of follow-
up, the inverse association of MTHFR with CVD mortality was
significant only in the period after introduction of mandatory folic
acid fortification.
Conclusion: The inverse association of MTHFR with CVD mortal-
ity was unexpected and highlights the need for caution in interpre-
tation of Mendelian randomization studies, which, like other
observational studies, can be influenced by chance, bias, or con-
founding. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:1245­53.
INTRODUCTION
Many observational studies have suggested that elevated blood
homocysteine concentration may be an independent risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (CVD)5 (1­6), but randomized trials
have shown that lowering homocysteine concentrations for 5 y
via supplementation with folic acid and other B vitamins has no
effect on the risk of CVD (7­12).
C677T is a common polymorphism of the gene MTHFR,
encoding the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme,
which uses folate to metabolize homocysteine. In populations
without folic acid fortification, individuals with the TT genotype
have lower blood folate and higher blood homocysteine con-
centrations than do people with the more common CC genotype.
In the absence of folic acid fortification, studies of MTHFR and
CVD can be used to assess the effects of lifelong differences in
homocysteine for CVD risk (13­15). Several meta-analyses of
previously published studies have reported that the MTHFR
C677T variant is associated with higher CVD risk (1, 3, 13, 16­
18), but the results have been conflicting. Some studies have
reported effect modification by folate status (3), and others have
suggested that publication bias or other methodologic problems
might account for the observed associations (3, 17). Few studies
also examined the association of MTHFR C677T with CVD
mortality (15, 19, 20), and none have examined possible effect
modification by longitudinal changes in folate status resulting
from folic acid fortification within a population.
The validity of observational epidemiologic studies can be
affected by unmeasured confounding of behavioral, physiologic,
or socioeconomic factors associated with both exposure and
disease (21). Mendelian randomization uses common genetic
polymorphisms that are known to influence exposure patterns or
to have effects such as a modifiable exposure as proxies that are
less susceptible to confounding by behavioral or environmental
exposures, thereby strengthening the ability of an observational
study to contribute causal inferences (22).

Although the MTHFR C677T variant has widespread effects
on several aspects of one-carbon metabolism (23), its effects on
CVD are believed chiefly to reflect lower serum folate and
higher serum homocysteine concentrations. In the current study,
we used Mendelian randomization to examine associations of
MTHFR C677T, a proxy for high homocysteine concentrations,
with CVD mortality and with all-cause mortality in a national
representative prospective cohort of the US adult population
carried out before the introduction of mandatory folic acid for-
tification of flour, with follow-up continued for approximately
equal periods before and after the introduction of folic acid
fortification.

NHANES III, each survey participant underwent a household
interview and a physical examination (23). Blood specimens for
DNA collection were obtained from NHANES III phase II
(1991­1994) participants aged 12 y.
NHANES III­Linked Mortality File
NHANES III (1988­1994) participants aged 17 y were
eligible for mortality follow-up, which has been completed for
deaths occurring through 31 December 2006. Mortality in-
formation is based on the results of a probabilistic match be-
tween NHANES III and National Death Index records. In the
current study, we used NHANES III DNA Data (1991­1994)
with linked mortality through 2006. The International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used to identify
the underlying cause of deaths. We included all-cause mortality,
deaths from CVD (ICD-10 codes I00­I51), ischemic heart dis-
ease (IHD; ICD-10 codes I20­I25), and stroke (ICD-10 codes
I60­I69) in our study. Survival follow-up continued until death
before 31 December 2006, but was censored at the date of death
for persons who died of causes other than CVD (except in the
all-cause mortality analysis) or at 31 December 2006, for per-
sons who are not known to have died.
Genotyping MTHFR C677T genetic variant

American, or other. Educational attainments were classified as
,12, 12­15, or .15 y of formal education. BMI was calculated
as weight (in kg) divided by height (in m) squared. History of
cigarette smoking was categorized as never, former, or current.
Alcohol consumption was classified as 0, ,3, 3 to ,7, or 7
drinks/wk. Hypertension (yes or no) was defined as average
blood pressure .90/140 mm Hg or use of antihypertension
medication. Diabetes or heart disease was self-reported or
inferred on the basis of taking specific medication for these
conditions (yes or no). Physical activity was categorized as 0,
,5, or 5 times/wk of walking, jogging or running, bicycling,
swimming, aerobics or aerobic dancing, other dancing, calis-
thenics, gardening or yard work, lifting weights, or other physical
activity or sports during the previous month. During the house-
hold interview, participants were asked about their use of dietary
supplements, including single vitamins, multivitamins, minerals,
and other nutritional substances. A participant was classified as a
folic acid supplement user (yes or no) if she or he reported taking
any folic acid supplement in the past month.
Simultaneous serum folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations
were measured by the National Center for Environmental Health/
CDC using a commercially available radioprotein binding assay
kit (Quantaphase II; Bio-Rad Laboratories) (24). Serum total
homocysteine concentrations were measured at the Jean Mayer
USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts
University by the HPLC method of Araki and Sako (25) and
Selhub et al (26).
Statistical analysis
We calculated means (6SEs) for continuous variables and
proportions and their 95% CIs for categorical variables by
MTHFR C677T genotype. Because the distributions of folate
and homocysteine concentrations were right skewed, we used
logarithmic transformations and calculated geometric means.
We used Satterthwaite-adjusted F statistics for continuous var-
iables and chi-square statistics for categorical variables to test
for differences across MTHFR C677T genotypes or the quintiles
of folate or homocysteine concentrations.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression methods to
estimate the HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause and CVD mortality
by different serum folate and homocysteine concentrations or by
MTHFR C677T genotype, with age as the time scale (beginning
at baseline) (27). We estimated sex- and race-ethnicity­adjusted
HRs and more comprehensive multivariable-adjusted HRs. The
extended multivariable models were adjusted for sex, race-eth-
nicity, educational attainment, BMI, smoking status, alcohol
intake, total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, history of heart
disease, use of dietary supplements containing folic acid during
the previous month, blood C-reactive protein concentration, and
physical activity as potential confounders. A P value for trend
across the HRs for the quintiles of folate or homocysteine con-
centrations or across the MTHFR C677T genotype was calcu-
lated by using a Satterthwaite-adjusted F test. All tests were
2-sided, and a P value ,0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
We also estimated HRs for all-cause and CVD mortality for
subgroups defined by sex, race-ethnicity, folic acid supplement
use (users compared with nonusers), folate status [folate de-
ficiency (,3.0 ng/mL) compared with normal folate (3.0 and
,12.2 ng/mL)], CVD status at baseline, and C-reactive protein
status (,1 compared with 1 mg/L) by MTHFR C677T genotype.
We tested for interactions between folate, homocysteine concen-
trations, and MTHFR C677T genotype (as an ordered categorical
variable) with the covariates by including interaction terms in the
Cox proportional hazards models based on Satterthwaite-adjusted
F tests. To account for multiple comparisons, the threshold
for statistical significance of interactions was adjusted by con-
trolling for the false discovery rates (28). The proportional
hazards assumptions of the Cox models were evaluated with
Schoenfeld residuals, which showed no significant departures

from proportionality in hazards over time (29). We analyzed data
using SUDAAN (version 9.2; Research Triangle Institute) to take
into account the complex sampling design of NHANES III (30).
Sensitivity analysis
To assess possible effects of mandatory folic acid fortification
of flour since 1 January 1998 (some manufacturers started vol-
untary fortification in mid-1996), we stratified the analyses for
all-cause and CVD mortality before and after the introduction of
mandatory folic acid fortification in January 1998. Because as-
sociations of MTHFR C677T with CVD mortality may differ by
age (deaths at younger ages are more likely to be affected by
high penetrance genes), we also examined associations by re-
stricting analyses to deaths occurring after 50 y of age.
RESULTS
Of the 7159 participants in the NHANES III DNA Bank, we
excluded 1211 participants aged ,19 y and 7 participants with
missing MTHFR C677T genotypes. Of 5925 participants included
in our study, 2353 were non-Hispanic white, 1619 were non-
Hispanic black, 1675 were Mexican American, and 278 were
from other race-ethnicity groups.
Among the eligible participants, there were 1211 deaths over
73,109 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 13.5 y), 525 of
which were from CVD, including 262 deaths from IHD and 94 from
stroke. Selected characteristics of the analysis cohort at baseline by
MTHFR C677T genotype are summarized in Table 1. The MTHFR
C677T genotype was associated with significantly lower serum
folate and significantly higher homocysteine concentrations
(P , 0.001), as expected. Individuals with the TT genotype had
2.2-lmol/L higher homocysteine and 1.4-ng/mL lower folate
concentrations on average than did those with the CC genotype.
The prevalence of TT genotype varied by ethnic group,
ranging from 1.2% in non-Hispanic blacks and 11.6% in non-
Hispanic whites to 19.4% in Mexican Americans (Table 2). As
shown in Table 3, a folate concentration .3.4 ng/mL was
generally associated with a lower risk of all-cause and CVD
mortality. The associations remained consistent across the race-
ethnicity groups studied (data not shown). However, as shown in
Table 4, the homocysteine concentration was not significantly
associated with the risk of all-cause or CVD mortality.

The MTHFR TT genotype was associated with a lower risk of
CVD mortality (Table 5). The adjusted HR for CVD mortality
was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.95) and for IHD mortality was 0.57
(95% CI: 0.31, 1.05) among individuals with the TT genotype
when compared with those with the CC genotype. These as-
sociations persisted after additional stratification by sex, race-
ethnicity, use of dietary supplements containing folic acid,
serum folate deficiency status (,3.0 compared with 3.0 and
,12.2 ng/mL), CVD status at baseline (yes or no), or C-reactive
protein status (,1.0 compared with 1.0 mg/L) (P . 0.05
for testing interactions) (Figure 1). Similar associations were
observed in the subset of deaths that occurred after 50 y of age
(see supplemental Table 1 under "Supplemental data" in the
online issue). In contrast, the MTHFR genotype was unrelated to
other causes of death or with all-cause mortality (Table 5). The
association of MTHFR TT genotype with a lower risk of CVD
mortality was chiefly due to deaths occurring after the in-
troduction of folic acid fortification in January 1998 (Table 6)
and those deaths occurring after 50 y of age (see supplemental
Table 2 under "Supplemental data" in the online issue).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative cohort study, the MTHFR
C677T TT genotype was associated with significantly lower se-
rum folate and higher homocysteine concentrations, consistent
with the results of previous studies (3, 13, 14, 31­34). Previous
studies also suggest that low folate or high homocysteine status is
associated with CVD mortality (35, 36) or risk of CVD (37­40).
We could not demonstrate both of these associations in this study,
and randomized controlled trials of B vitamin supplementation to
lower blood homocysteine concentration have clearly shown no
beneficial effects on risk of major vascular events (41).
Because of Mendelian randomization, we expected to find that
MTHFR TT genotype, as a proxy for lifelong high blood homo-
cysteine concentrations, was associated with an increased risk of
CVD mortality if high blood homocysteine concentrations were
a cause of CVD mortality. Unexpectedly, we found TT genotype
to be associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD mortality,
and a stratified analysis showed that this effect occurred only in
the period after mandatory folic acid fortification. The observed
inverse association of the TT genotype was consistent across sex,
race-ethnicity, use of supplements containing folic acid, serum
folate deficiency status, CVD status at baseline, and C-reactive
protein status. The association was also apparent when the anal-
ysis was restricted to individuals who died after 50 y of age.
Most previous MTHFR C667T variant association studies
focused on the risk of CVD and concluded that MTHFR C677T
polymorphism was associated with a moderately increased risk
of CVD occurrence (3, 13, 18). Only a few previous studies
examined the association of MTHFR C677T with CVD or all-
cause mortality (15, 19, 20). In an 18-y follow-up of 12,239
middle-aged women living in the Netherlands, a population
without folic acid fortification (15), the rate ratios for CVD
mortality were 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 0.9) for women with the CT
genotype and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.0) for women with the TT ge-
notype, compared with women with the CC genotype, consistent
with the current study. In a further Dutch cohort of 666 elderly
(aged 85 y) individuals, the MTHFR TT genotype was associ-
ated with a significantly higher risk ratio of all-cause mortality
(2.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.9), but this effect was attributable to more
deaths from cancer, not CVD (19). In a 6-y follow-up of a pro-
spective study of 710 kidney transplant recipients living in Austria
(again without mandatory folic acid fortification) (20), the
MTHFR C677T genotype was unrelated to all-cause mortality.
The reasons for this paradoxical finding of an inverse association
of MTHFR C677T genotype with CVD mortality are unclear. We
cannot rule out the possibility that the associations we observed
occurred by chance. However, the consistency of our findings with
other prospective studies of MTHFR C677T with CVD mortality
(15, 19) make this unlikely. Although the factors that predispose to
the development of CVD might be distinct from those that de-
termine CVD deaths, people who died with CVD were most likely
to have CVD listed as an underlying cause of death (42).
Meta-analyses of published studies of MTHFR C677Tand risk
of incident CVD have suggested an excess risk of CVD in

European and Japanese studies, but not in North American
studies (3, 13, 40). The geographic differences might indicate
that the influence of the TT genotype is dependent on folate
status, because the folate intake increased substantially in North
American countries after January 1998, when folic acid fortifi-
cation was introduced (43). After that time, the average serum
folate concentration increased by 2-fold, the average homo-
cysteine concentration fell significantly among the general
population (44), and the difference in the homocysteine con-
centration by the MTHFR C677T genotype was significantly
attenuated (45). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the temporal association between when the inverse association
of CVD mortality and MTHFR TT genotype began to become
apparent and when mandatory folate fortification was im-
plemented in the United States was merely coincidental.
The current study had several major strengths, including the
availability of MTHFR C677T genotyping and serum folate and
homocysteine measurements from a nationally representative
cohort sample of the US adult population, investigation of
a large number of potential confounding variables, and ascer-
tainment of all-cause and CVD mortality over a reasonable
length of time (median follow-up: 13.5 y). The prospective co-
hort design of the current study was less sensitive to selection
bias or to information bias than are cross-sectional or case-
control studies (21). Moreover, Mendelian randomization stud-
ies are typically less susceptible to confounding, apart from
population stratification, or reverse causality than are other ob-
servational studies. In addition, the genotypes were invariant
over time and should be related to lifelong differences in ho-
mocysteine concentrations. Use of these genotypes would, there-
fore, be expected to be superior to single measurements of serum
folate or homocysteine concentrations as measures of lifetime
folate or homocysteine status.
This study had several limitations. First, because of the limited
number of deaths for each specific CVD, such as IHD or stroke,
we primarily confined our analyses to all-cause and CVD mor-
tality. Second, the NHANES III Linked Mortality File identified
causes of death through the National Death Index, which is based
on death certificates, which are known to be subject to error in
classification of the cause of death. Third, the last 8 y of follow-up
in the current cohort occurred after mandatory folic acid forti-
fication began in the United States. Possible explanations for the
discrepant results between the current study and some previous
studies may reflect the effects of confounding of the MTHFR
C677T genotype on risk of total or CVD mortality by the sub-
stantial changes in folate status that occurred after fortification
(44).
Although Mendelian randomization studies using functional
variants such as MTHFR C677T are generally unaffected by
confounding and reverse causality, they are still susceptible to
publication bias, population stratification, and genetic pleiotropy
(46, 47). Such biases can seriously distort the true associations
with coronary heart disease (CHD), even for a variant that has
been as extensively studied as MTHFR. Recently, the MTHFR
Studies Collaboration reported a definitive meta-analysis of
MTHFR and CHD avoiding publication bias and compared
meta-analyses of published studies and unpublished datasets
obtained from genome-wide association studies or other large-
scale genotyping panels (48). In this meta-analysis, 19 un-
published data sets were obtained, involving 48,175 CHD cases
and 67,961 controls, in which multiple genetic variants had been
measured that included MTHFR only incidentally (47). These
data sets did not include measurements of blood homocysteine,
but homocysteine concentrations would be expected to be
;20% higher with the TT than with the CC genotype in the
populations studied. In meta-analyses of these unpublished data
sets, the case-control CHD ORs and 95% CIs for a comparison
of the TT with the CC genotype was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.07;
P = 0.28) overall and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.07) in the low-folate
populations. In contrast, in a slightly updated meta-analysis of
the 86 published studies, involving 28,617 CHD cases and
41,857 controls, the OR was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.21), signif-
icantly discrepant (P = 0.001) with the OR in the unpublished
data sets. The discrepancy in the results of the published and
unpublished studies in the MTHFR Studies Collaboration re-
flected publication bias or other methodologic problems (48).
The findings of the study suggesting that the TT genotype of the
MTHFR C677T genetic variant was associated with a lower risk
of CVD mortality, especially in a population with adequate folate
intake, again highlights the need for caution in the interpretation
of Mendelian randomization studies, which, like other observa-
tional studies, can be influenced by chance, bias, or confounding.
