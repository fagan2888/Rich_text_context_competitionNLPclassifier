Aim. To examine the association between age at first alcohol use and risk of heavy alcohol use among the adult US general drinking
population. Methods. This population-based study used the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from United
States. Multivariate Poisson regression was employed to predict the frequency of heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks per
occasion) in the last 30 days with age at first use of alcohol controlling for potential confounding factors. Results. Younger age at
first use of alcohol was associated with increased likelihood of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days in this population-based sample.
This association remained significant when analysis was reperformed for the subgroup of participants who were with desired good
health status and Kessler score lower than 12. Conclusion. Younger age at first use of alcohol was associated with increased likelihood
of heavy alcohol use.
1. Introduction
Several studies have suggested that people who start drinking
at a younger age have an increased risk of alcohol use
disorders [1­6]. It has been hypothesized that the interactions
among genetic and environmental factors play an important
role in this observed association; however, the underlying
causal mechanism is not fully understood [6]. Our recent
analysis of data collected by the Australian National Drug
Strategy Household Survey showed that age at first use was
associated with a higher level of subsequent alcohol use
among the general Australian population [7]. This association
remained significant even after the analysis was limited to
the population who had good (i.e., "desired") health status
and low psychological distress [7]. To determine whether
this observation is specific to the Australian population
or generalizable, it is important to further investigate the
relationship between early onset of alcohol use and heavy
alcohol use in other populations. If early onset of alcohol
use independently (i.e., independent of other socioeconomic
and environmental risk factors) leads to heavy drinking
behaviours, then it may be postulated that, to some extent,
early alcohol use causes alcohol use disorders by increasing
the frequency of heavy alcohol use. In this study, we aimed to
examine the association between age at first alcohol use and
risk of heavy alcohol use among the adult US general drinking
population.
2. Method
Details of sampling strategy and data collection methods
have been described in the 2010 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH) report [8, 9]. Briefly, the NSDUH
is a national survey targeting the 12-year and older non-
institutionalized population of the United States. The 2010
survey used computer-assisted face-to-face interviews to
collect drug use information and demographic information
from respondents. In order to produce both national and
state level estimates, multistage stratification and randomiza-
tion combined sampling method was used [8]. In the 2010
NSDUH, participants were asked detailed questions about
their alcohol use, including age at first use of alcohol. The
original question was: "Think about the first time you had a
drink of an alcoholic beverage. How old were you the first
time you had a drink of an alcoholic beverage? Please do

not include any time when you only had a sip or two from
a drink." In the 2010 NSDUH, a "drink" was defined as "a can
or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of
liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it." Participants were
also asked about the frequency of heavy alcohol use over the
last month. Heavy alcohol use was defined as consuming 5
or more drinks on the same occasion. The original question
asked in the survey was: "During the past 30 days, that is since
(the date 30 days before the interview), on how many days did
you have 5 or more drinks on the same occasion? By occasion,
we mean at the same time or within a couple of hours of each
other" [8]. In this study, we investigated whether age at first
use of alcohol predicted frequency of heavy alcohol (in the
last 30 days) at older ages.
2.1. Data Analysis. Multivariate Poisson regression was
employed to predict the frequency of heavy alcohol use (more
than 5 drinks per occasion) in the last 30 days with age at first
use of alcohol. Potential confounding factors, including cur-
rent age, gender, level of achieved education, income, marital
status, general health status, and psychological distress level
in the last 30 days, were controlled in the model. Sampling
weight provided in the dataset was applied in the analysis.
The analysis was first performed with all adult participants
(age 18) who consumed alcohol in the last 12 months. There
were 29,315 participants aged 18 years at the time of the
survey and who had consumed alcohol in the last twelve
months. Less than 3% of these participants did not provide
necessary information on the dependent variables or some
of the independent variables and therefore were excluded
from the multivariate analysis. Given that heavy alcohol use
was more prevalent among young adults, the analysis was
independently repeated for those aged 18­29 years and 30­
49 years.
As noted in our previous study using an Australian
sample, physical and mental morbidities may influence the
relationship between age at first use of alcohol and frequency
of heavy alcohol use [7]. The 2010 NSDUH included the
Kessler 6 scale and a question on general health [8]. The
Kessler 6 scale is a sensitive measure of the existence of
nonspecific mental conditions. A score of 0­12 indicates low
risk of a mental health condition being present [10­12]. Self-
reported health status with five categories (excellent, very
good, good, fair, and poor) was used as the indicator of health
in the survey. Self-reported health status has also been shown
to be a valid and reliable measurement of general health and
has been repeatedly used in the NSDUH and other national
surveys [13­15]. Limiting the sample to those with a low
Kessler score and good self-rated health status substantially
reduces the likelihood that any observed association will be
influenced by the presence of physical or mental disorders [7,
14, 16­18]. We therefore repeated the analysis on a subsample
limited to those with Kessler scores of 12 or less and with a
self-rating of health that was good, very good, or excellent.
In order to further control for residual confounding
effects, a proxy outcome (number of days smoked in the
last 30 days) was used to estimate the effects of residual
confounding effects. A similar approach has been used to
examine the "protective" effect of moderate alcohol use [16,
17]. This was achieved by using number of days smoked in
the last 30 days as the outcome variable instead of frequency

of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days, while keeping all the
controlled variables unchanged. Participants included those
aged 18 years at the time of the survey who had consumed
alcohol in the last twelve months. This approach operates on
the basis that alcohol use and tobacco use share a similar
set of confounders [19­23]. We also assume that any causal
relationship between age at first use of alcohol and tobacco at
older ages is weaker than age at first use of alcohol and future
heavy alcohol use. Any observed effects of age at first use on
tobacco use were thus controlled for in the final model.
3. Results
From the univariate analysis, it was observed that the preva-
lence of consuming more than 5 drinks on the same occasion
at least once in the last 30 days was significantly higher among
participants who started consuming alcohol before the age
of 18 years among both males and females. Similar results
were observed when analyses were limited to those between
20 and 29 years and those between 30 and 49 years (Table 1).
The multivariate analysis also indicated that starting to drink
alcohol at a younger age was associated with significantly
increased risk of heavy alcohol use over the last 30 days.
Participants with less desirable health status or with a Kessler
6 score higher than 12 were significantly more likely to engage
in heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days. Participants who
were 65 years or older were least likely to engage in heavy
alcohol use (Table 2). Among the subgroup of participants
aged 20­29 years who rated their health as good, very good,
or excellent and who had a Kessler score lower than 12,
having consumed alcohol before the age of 18 years remained
a significant risk factor for heavy alcohol use. Conversely,
having first consumed alcohol at or after the age of 25 years
reduced the risk of heavy alcohol use. Similar results were
observed for those aged 30­49 years (Table 3).
Significant associations between age at first use of alcohol
and smoking were observed. The adjusted relative risks for
smoking were 1.49 (95% confidence interval: 1.29, 1.70), 1.57
(1.43, 1.72), 1.36 (1.25, 1.49), and 1.00 (reference level) for first
use of alcohol before 12 years, 12­14 years, 15­17 years, and
18­24 years, respectively. After controlling for these effects,
the relative risk of heavy alcohol use by first use of alcohol
remained significant, although the effect size was somewhat
reduced to 2.03 (1.68, 2.45), 1.66 (1.46, 1.89), 1.41 (1.25, 1.59),
and 1.00 (reference) for first use of alcohol before 12 years, 12­
14 years, 15­17 years, and 18­24 years, respectively.
4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated the association between age at
first use of alcohol and current alcohol consumption using
US data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health. Younger age at first use of alcohol was associated with
increased likelihood of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days
in this population-based sample. This association was not
dependent on level of psychological distress and health status.
The findings of this study are consistent with the findings
from a previous study of Australia's population [7]. This also
suggests that the association between early onset of alcohol
use and heavy alcohol consumption in later life cannot
be fully explained by concurrent negative socioeconomic
and environmental factors that usually influence the risk of

physical diseases and mental disorders including alcohol use
disorders [14, 18, 24, 25].
The causal mechanism underlying this observed associ-
ation is not fully understood. It is plausible that starting to
use alcohol before the age of 18 years directly increases the
risk of developing heavy alcohol use behaviours. The risk
of developing habitual heavy alcohol use before the age of
18 years is nil for a person who starts drinking after the
age of 18 years. However, in keeping with the relatively high
prevalence of frequent heavy alcohol use among adolescents,
the risk well exceeds zero for a person who starts drinking
before the age of 18 years [26, 27]. In addition, compared to
adults, adolescents are more likely to engage in sensation-
seeking and risk-taking behaviours [9, 16]; therefore given
access to alcohol, the risk of frequent heavy alcohol use
may be higher in adolescence than in adulthood. It is
nevertheless important that parental attitudes and behaviours
during their children's initial exposure to alcohol may have
substantial effects on their future consumption patterns
[28­32].
The causal relationship between heavy alcohol use and
alcohol use disorders is clear as heavy alcohol use is a
necessary condition for the development of any alcohol use
disorder; it follows therefore that increased risk of heavy
alcohol use will further increase the risk of alcohol use
disorders. Onset of alcohol use before the age of 18 years
would therefore increase the risk of alcohol use disorders.
Abstinence from alcohol until the age of 18 years will
reduce the risk of alcohol-related harm. These findings
are closely relevant to legislations on minimum drinking
age.
5. Conclusion
Younger age at first use of alcohol was associated with
increased likelihood of heavy alcohol use.
