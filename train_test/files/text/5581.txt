Introduction: Spatial Big
Data and everyday life
Agnieszka Leszczynski1 and Jeremy Crampton2
Abstract
Spatial Big Data--be this natively geocoded content, geographical metadata, or data that itself refers to spaces and
places--has become a pervasive presence in the spaces and practices of everyday life. Beyond preoccupations with ``the
geotag'' and with mapping geocoded social media content, this special theme explores what it means to encounter and
experience spatial Big Data as a quotidian phenomenon that is both spatial, characterized by and enacting of material
spatialities, and spatializing, configuring relations between subjects, objects, and spaces in new and unprecedented ways.

Everyday spatial Big Data
It has been estimated that up to 80% of Big Data is
``spatial'' insofar as it is characterized by a locational
component (Farmer and Pozdnoukhov, 2012; Folger,
2011), be this spatial coordinates, geographical meta-
data, an associated street address, or where the content
of data events themselves make reference to a place in
physical space. This claim as to 80% of data produc-
tions being spatial in nature however predates the Big
Data present; it was first made by Antenucci in 1989.
To say that data is and has always already been spatial
is therefore neither novel nor original. What, then, is it
that is being made actual in spatial Big Data? This is
the subject of the papers assembled here. This special
theme arose from a series of sessions on ``Spatial Big
Data and Everyday Life'' organized at the Association
of American Geographers (AAG) annual conference in
Chicago in 2015. There were two questions which moti-
vated us: what difference does it make to conceptualize
a specifically spatial Big Data as opposed to Big Data
per se; and second, how does spatial Big Data play out,
and with what effects, at the level of the everyday? Each
of the papers advances unique responses to these ques-
tions, approaching spatial Big Data through multiple
epistemological and theoretical lenses that offer up
diverse interpretations of the spatiality of Big Data
and its everydayness.
As a colloquial designator, ``everyday'' has connota-
tions of ordinary, quotidian, and frequent. As articu-
lated by Taylor et al. (2014), data has become entirely
ordinary and expected presences in the spaces and prac-
tices of everyday life. Certainly, data has always been
produced in places, by actors--both human and other
than human--occupying those spaces. Many Big Data
productions and attendant analytics regimes have their
precursors in identifiably spatial/geographical ante-
cedents. For example, location-based advertising, pre-
mised on the aggregation of individual spatial histories,
real-time locations, and past consumptive behaviors,
emerged from geodemographic information systems
(GDIS), which coupled geodemographic analytics to
interfaces of geographic information systems (Dalton
and Thatcher, 2015). GDIS' themselves grew out
of what Bouk (2015) refers to as ``massifying'' data
practices of the 20th century, particularly those of
mass marketing. Yet the ``routine, taken-for granted''
presence of geocoded and geolocatable content (data)

``in homes, neighborhoods and communities'' (Dyck,
2005: 234)--or what Taylor et al. (2014) alternatively
call ``the street''--is entirely unprecedented by previous
socio-technical geographic information technology
assemblages, genres of techno-cultural productions, or
praxes. From the scale of the city (Graham, 2013) to
that of the street (Taylor et al., 2014) and increasingly
reaching into the intimate spaces of the home
(Speed and Luger, 2014), our physical, emotional, and
imagined landscapes, as well as our experiences of these
spaces, are constituted, augmented, and mediated by
data (Leszczynski, 2015b).
Our understanding of the spatial everyday is accord-
ingly further informed by Berlant's (2011) observation
that the present is not an object, but a ``mediated
affect.'' Importantly for Berlant, the everyday is also
a series of ways of addressing anxieties, not as crises
that create radical breaks, but as intensifications of
already existing situations, what she calls ``crisis ordin-
ariness,'' wherein: ``[c]risis is not exceptional to history
of consciousness but [is] a process embedded in the
ordinary that unfolds in stories about navigating
what's overwhelming'' (10).
In this sense, we advance spatial Big Data as an
intensification of two related anxieties: (i) anxieties
around data itself (what we term ``data anxieties''),
and (ii) anxieties latent in subjective individuation and
the governance of subjects.
Everyday anxieties
The rise of spatial Big Data is intimately bound up with
twinned anxieties around data: that of data being insuf-
ficient for tasks at hand, while simultaneously being
over-sufficient). Kate Crawford (2014) discusses this
in terms of the double fear of not being abstracted
into data flows and consequently being ``left out'' of
algorithmic socio-spatial sorting praxes which increas-
ingly structure access to life opportunities, and that
associated with the consequences of actually being
abstracted into and algorithmically reassembled
across data flows in ways that are overly revealing of
the personal details of our most intimate selves. The
public disclosures of the extensive data-driven surveil-
lance practices of the securities agencies--many of
which involve the capture, interception, and aggrega-
tion of specifically locational information about individ-
uals--have engendered societal ``anxieties of control''
whereby individuals wish to direct and maintain the
integrity of flows of their personal locational data at
the level of devices, applications, and platforms, but
overwhelmingly feel that any attempts to do so are
effectively futile (Leszczynski, 2015a).
At the same time, Big Data, spatial and otherwise, is
implicated within new modes of subject formation and
subjectivity that allow for nascent data practices of
assembling and disassembling subjects, as well as tar-
geting individuals within data-driven practices of sur-
veillance (Tufekci, 2014) and location-based advertising
(Dalton and Thatcher, 2015). Accordingly, a second
circuit of intensification may be identified around the
targeting and governance of subjects. Building on
Foucault (2008), spatial Big Data it is created ``at the
interface of governors and governed . . . an element of
transactional reality in the history of governmental
technologies, a transactional reality which seems
to . . . be absolutely correlative to the form of govern-
mental technology we call liberalism'' (297).
Subjects come to be individuated as data such that
they may be governed in new ways through individual
modes of subjective targeting (Amoore, 2011), but not
governed too much such that data effects forms of
``soft'' rather than overt control (see Sadowski and
Pasquale, 2015). Importantly, the data of govern-
ance--behaviors, negotiations, tactics, deals, computa-
tions, interactions with subjects and other lively
objects--is transactions (of behavior, negotiation, com-
putation, interaction, etc.) rather than simply attributes
at locations (geotags). Spatial Big Data is a representa-
tional solution to capturing these interactions for a wide
variety of purposes in a (neo)liberal market, through
the capture of subjects and subjectivities as derivatives
and data doubles (Amoore, 2011) that allow for new
modes of highly targeted and individualized geosurveil-
lance practices. Its biggest challenge may be in entering
precisely that sphere of the ``thinking-feeling'' subject
rather than just the ``signifying-subjectifying'' one
(Anderson, 2015: 3).
In other words, there is an anxiety around spatial
Big Data being able to cope with affects, which neces-
sitate an expansion of the limited interpretation of the
``spatial'' in spatial Big Data' as geographical referents
(coordinates, metadata, address, content) that may be
attached to data events, or which are somehow intrinsic
to data productions and flows (Crampton et al., 2013;
Shelton, 2016). The papers that comprise this special
theme do so by going not only ``beyond the geotag,''
but also beyond the narrow engagement of easily avail-
able social media content as a source of spatial Big
Data for analysis, mapping, methodological innov-
ation, and theoretical engagement.
Beyond the geotag, beyond
social media data
We do not mean to suggest that the now pervasive
geocoding of content is not significant. Indeed, it
importantly constitutes new sources of data previously
unavailable for the identification and analysis of vari-
ous kinds of socio-spatial processes, such as daytime
2 Big Data & Society
racial segregation in American cities (Shelton et al.,
2015). Nevertheless, a fixation on ``the geotag'' engen-
ders a fetishization of data that is mapped or mappable,
betraying an implicit commitment to a spatial ontology
underwritten by a ``Cartesian ideal of space as divorced
from social relations'' that engenders an ``over-privile-
g[ing of] the single latitude/longitude coordinate pair''
(Shelton, 2016: 4, 3). Such fixations on the geotag
undergird falsely universal claims about the world
and the people who inhabit it drawn on the basis of
what is non-representative data generated piecemeal by
individuals who represent both selective and self-
selecting populations. Given that small percentages of
individuals in any one country are Twitter users, and
only 1% of Tweets are natively geocoded, geocoded
Tweets are not, for example, valid or meaningful
proxies of global mobility patterns, contra for example
Hawelka et al. (2014). Elsewhere, animated ectoplasm
maps of trending topics on Twitter--such as those men-
tioning racialized police brutality culminating in police
shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent organized
activities in Ferguson, MI--promote an understanding
of these events as ``novel and fleeting'' rather than as
the gradual outcomes of social inequalities and disaf-
fections rooted in the historical legacies and historical
geographies of racial segregation and Jim Crow in the
American South (Shelton, 2016: 6).
As Crampton et al. (2013) and Shelton (2016) vocif-
erously argue, we must accordingly go ``beyond the
geotag'' and attendant ``burger cartographies''1 by
being attuned to and accounting for the social,
political, economic, and cultural contexts of spatial
Big Data production, circulation, capture, assembly,
analysis, and visualization (see also boyd and
Crawford, 2012; Graham and Shelton, 2013; Wilson,
2014). Crampton et al. (2013) provide a five-pronged
heuristic that may serve as a framework for a nuanced
engagement of geocoded social media content. They
encourage scholars and researchers to ``go beyond'' (i)
the ``x,y'' of data that is natively spatial, by, for exam-
ple, identifying locations of retweets; (ii) the spatialities
of the present, by examining the space­times of data
diffusion; (iii) the proximate, by being attuned to the
relationalities of data productions and flows; (iv) the
human, by including content generated by the other
than human, namely bots; and (v) user-generated
data, by contextualizing, reading, and analyzing these
productions against ancillary data sources (such as
census data). Shelton (2016) expounds on this by advo-
cating for a relational approach to geotagged social
media data. At the most basic level, this does not
involve changing the way that such data is mapped
(represented) per se but instead emphasizes how geo-
coded spatial media content is collected and filtered by,
for example, normalizing the selection of tweets relating
to a particular topic by tweet density (all Twitter activ-
ity). More complex methodologies are available, such
as calculating the confidence interval of an odds ratio,
which give greater weight to locations characterized by
heightened levels of Twitter activity which also experi-
ence greater relative degrees of tweeting about a par-
ticular topic (for examples of this approach, see
Poorthuis et al., 2016; Shelton et al., 2014, 2015).
While these entreaties for going ``beyond the geotag''
provide robust methodological imperatives for
transcending superficial fetishization of locational
coordinate pairs, they themselves nevertheless over-
emphasize (geocoded) social media data. In the same
ways that ``the geotag'' represents a limited facet of
social content, geocoded social media data is likewise
an instance of, but not sufficient for, the assemblage of
data productions, presences, and practices that consti-
tute and fall within the rubric of ``spatial Big Data.'' In
convening this special theme on spatial Big Data, we
strive to go beyond not only the geotag, but also the
fixation on social media content. The contributions
brought together here do precisely this by engaging
and interpreting the spatiality of (spatial) Big Data in
nuanced through variegated ways.
Thatcher calls for attention to be given to the sub-
jects producing spatial Big Data through quotidian
engagements with location-aware and -enabled mobile
devices as an object of research and scholarly attention.
As he rightly argues, too often emphasis has been given
to the content productions themselves (e.g., natively
geocoded Tweets) rather than the subjectivities and
subject positionalities of the individuals actively (and
at other times passively) generating spatial Big Data.
This importantly signals imperatives for research
which, because they are methodologically and empiric-
ally far more challenging to address, remain open: how
are individuals contending and reconciling with the rea-
lities of living in a (spatial) Big Data present? (Couldry
and Powell, 2014; Leszczynski, 2015a). Beginning to
unpack the nature of the ``experience of Big Data''
(Crawford, 2014) demands engagement with subjects
and subjectivities as of course there is no such thing
as universal experience; all experience is contingent on
subject positionality. African-American communities,
for instance, have long been subject to extensive
regimes and practices of historical dataveillance that
have reified and shaped material subjectivities and
everyday lives along racial lines (Browne, 2015).
It is precisely to this question of what data mean to
ordinary people on the street that Wilmott speaks to in
her ethnography of embodied spatial experiences of
locative media in the historical and geographical con-
texts of Sydney and Hong Kong. She presents multiple
narratives that capture the ways in which Big Data is
not only something that is located in space (has a
Leszczynski and Crampton 3
spatiality or geography), but something that simultan-
eously actively locates. The quotidian experience of
spatial Big Data is thus always one of being located;
or, alternatively, of the anxieties of not being located or
of being unable to locate oneself in space, of intimately
experiencing one's subjective erasure from the map-
based interface, as recounted by an Aborigine interview
subject in Sydney who identified the instrumentalist
representation of space to be incongruous with
Aborigine identity, claims to, senses of, and experiences
of place. The subjective experience of being located is
furthermore often one that is incomplete, an incom-
pleteness that is rendered acute when spatial Big Data
fails to accurately or effectively situate the subject in
space.
Big Data, in other words, is neither total nor totali-
zing--it is, as per Straube, not a ``singular formation.''
Straube resists the reducibility of complex Big Data
infrastructures to a monolithic phenomenon or entity
through the model of the stack by tracing the ``spatial
life'' of the version control system Git. As defined by
Straube, the stack is ``a natively technical framework to
think conceptually about the various layers of proto-
cols, code, and data formats involves in the functioning
of'' digital networked data infrastructures. It provides a
means for unpacking the ways in which data infrastruc-
tures are defined by and implicate particular spatialities
(as well as temporalities), which Straube approaches
through the introduction of the concept of ``topology,''
or hierarchical relationships between layered ``stacks''
in the infrastructure. This captures the ways in which
protocols are layered over top of each other in the
stack, for example, such that rendering a web page
(retrieving and reifying data) is made possible by verti-
cally translating between complementary, hierarchically
linked (and in the case of internet protocols, independ-
ent) components of software in particular sequence or
order.
Big Data infrastructures enact their own spatialities,
but they are simultaneously inflected by the geograph-
ical specificities of the sociocultural contexts of their
production. In his contribution, Cockayne examines
the ways in which the valuing of social media data is
informed by the spatial exceptionalism of California's
Silicon Valley/Bay Area startup culture, in which early
stage technology firms (startups) compete social capital
(users, adoption) as a basis for securing economic cap-
ital in an attention economy. He argues that in addition
to functioning as systems for accumulation (venture
investment, profit), social media platforms and attend-
ant data productions simultaneously function as sys-
tems for securing, appropriating, and circulating user
attention: adoption of platforms, generation of ``likes,''
retweets, Instagram comments. This affective value is
closely related to economic value, wherein
monetization of platforms through advertising/promo-
tion or monetary windfalls to startup founders through
buyouts/acquisitions is dependent on active and numer-
ous membership and user base.
Emphasizing economic value over affective value,
Alvarez Leo
´ n examines the ways in which spatial Big
Data--or geoinformation--is being progressively
intimately incorporated into the digital economy
through the rubric of ``property regimes,'' which he
uses to describe the ways in which actors are working
to stake ownership claims over spatial content as a
means of extracting value (profit) from these data pro-
ductions. Using the example of Google Street View,
Alvarez Leon demonstrates the ways in which the inte-
gration of Street View imagery and perspectivalism into
the broader Google search product through the transfer
and appropriation of rights to and from users (use of
API keys; capture of their presence on the street) con-
stitutes perhaps the ``most thorough and expansive
commodification of geographic information ever
attempted.'' The exchange of personal data (capture
of one's presence on the street in Street View imagery)
for the utility value of the interface (fine resolution spa-
tial data at the level of the street; precise navigational
functionality) implicates precisely the twin anxieties of
spatial data (insufficient; overly sufficient) described
above.
Conclusion
Here, we have advanced an engagement with spatial
Big Data beyond the geotag and beyond content pro-
ductions sourced from social media platforms by bring-
ing together a series of interventions that take up and
interpret the ``spatial'' in spatial Big Data in variegated
and nuanced ways, approaching phenomena of spatial
Big Data and their everydayness via different epistemo-
logical and methodological approaches. As a quotidian,
pervasive presence in the spaces and practices of every-
day life, Big Data is both located, and something that
locates. Infrastructures, for instance, extend their own
spatialities (as well as temporalities; Straube). The com-
modification of geographic information is both a
response to and simultaneously fuels neoliberal polit-
ical economic imperatives and the anxieties of monetiz-
ing and generating profit from networked platforms
and services.
The everyday experience of data is increasingly one
of being located in space; or at times, it is one of con-
spicuously not being located and of experiencing and
contending with the anxieties of the failure of the
incompleteness of Big Data that arise in instances
where one cannot be placed (or actively place oneself)
in space (Wilmott). Data is inflected by and bears the
traces of the geographical specificities and neoliberal

effects of the sites of their production, in ways
that implicate new modes of governing subjects, and
the modes by which subjects govern themselves
(Cockayne, 2016). In other words, these very Big
Data productions are intimately bound up with subject-
ivity and subject formation (Thatcher) and the twinned
anxieties of spatial Big Data (not enough, and too
much data; individuated subjectivities which engender
new modes of data-driven governance, but not too
much governance).
