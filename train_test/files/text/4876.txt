Introduction
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogra-
phy (ERCP) is the standard procedure, with a
high success rate, for the treatment of biliary
obstruction [Fogel et al. 2001; Freeman and
Guda, 2005]. However, ERCP may not be pos-
sible in patients with selective cannulation failure
or an inaccessible papilla due to a surgically
altered anatomy or duodenal obstruction [Park
et al. 2011; Ogura et al. 2014]. Percutaneous
transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is an alter-
native form of biliary accesses after failed ERCP.
Although PTBD constitutes an effective alterna-
tive biliary drainage, it showed a relative high rate
of adverse events and physical discomfort related
to the external drainage [Van Delden and
Lameris, 2008]. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided
biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has been proposed
as a useful alternative to ERCP [Giovannini
et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2016]. Recently, EUS-
guided hepaticogastrostomy with transmural
stenting (EUS-HGS) has been used for biliary
decompression in patients with an inaccessible
papilla. However, EUS-HGS is an inherently

Abstract
Background: Although endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) with
transmural stenting has increased for biliary decompression in patients with an inaccessible
papilla, the optimal biliary access point and the learning curve of EUS-HGS have not been
studied. We evaluated the optimal biliary access point and learning curve for technically
successful EUS-HGS.
Methods: 129 consecutive patients (male n = 81, 62.3%; malignant n = 113, 87.6%) who
underwent EUS-HGS due to an inaccessible papilla were enrolled. EUS finding and procedure
times according to each needle puncture attempt in EUS-HGS were prospectively measured.
Learning curves of EUS-HGS were calculated for two main outcome measurements
(procedure time and adverse events) by using the moving average method and cumulative sum
(CUSUM) analysis, respectively.
Results: A total of 174 EUS-HGS attempts were performed in 129 patients. The mean number
of needle punctures was 1.35 ± 0.57. Using the logistic regression model, bile duct diameter
of the puncture site  5 mm [odds ratio (OR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71­8.1, p < 0.01]
and hepatic portion length [linear distance from the mural wall to the punctured bile duct wall on
EUS; mean hepatic portion length was 27 mm (range 10­47 mm)] > 3 cm (OR 5.7, 95% CI: 2.7­12,
p < 0.01) were associated with low technical success. Procedure time and adverse events were
shorter after 24 cases, and stabilized at 33 cases of EUS-HGS, respectively.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that a bile duct diameter > 5 mm and hepatic portion length
1 cm to  3 cm on EUS may be suitable for successful EUS-HGS. In our learning curve analysis,
over 33 cases might be required to achieve the plateau phase for successful EUS-HGS.

complicated procedure and can lead to poten-
tially fatal adverse events [Park et al. 2013; Song
et al. 2014]. It still remains a difficult procedure
for endosonographers in centers with a low
volume of EUS-HGS because it is an operator-
dependent process, and reliant upon with an
accumulation of experience in EUS-HGS.
Currently, there are a lack of data regarding the
optimum biliary access point and the learning
curve of EUS-HGS. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to evaluate the optimal biliary access
point for technically successful EUS-HGS. The
secondary aim was to evaluate the EUS-HGS
learning curve.
Method
Patients
A total of 129 patients were enrolled in this study
from June 2008 to February 2012. A total of 174
attempts at EUS-HGS were performed by a sin-
gle experienced endoscopist (D.H.P.). Our inclu-
sion criteria were (1) failure of initial biliary
cannulation or bile duct decompression through
ERCP because of accompanying duodenal
obstruction, periampullary tumor infiltration,
surgically altered anatomy, or high-grade hilar
biliary stricture, or failed guidewire manipulation
in EUS-guided antegrade stenting and (2)
patients who refused PTBD. Our exclusion crite-
ria were (1) refusal to participate in the study pro-
tocol, (2) patients with accessible papillae and
attempt of EUS-guided rendezvous, (3) preg-
nancy, and (4) patient age less than 20 years. All
patients provided written informed consent for
participation in this study. The Institutional
Review Board approved the study protocol (IRB
No. 2016-0380), and specific informed consent
was obtained from each patient to perform
EUS-BD before the procedure.
Procedure
Antibiotics were administered to all patients
before the intervention. EUS-HGS was per-
formed using a GF-UCT 240 linear-array ech-
oendoscope (Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo,
Japan). The echoendoscope was placed in the
cardia or lesser curvature of the stomach, and ori-
ented to view the intrahepatic duct. Color
Doppler imaging was used to identify the regional
vasculature. A bile duct puncture was performed
with a 19-gauge needle (EUSN-19-T; Cook
Medical, Winston-Salem, USA). To confirm suc-
cessful biliary access, contrast medium was
injected under fluoroscopy to demonstrate biliary
opacification. A 0.035-inch guidewire [Tracer
(Hybrid Wire Guide guidewire, Cook Medical,
Bloomington, USA); Jagwire (Boston Scientific,
Natick, USA)] or a 0.025-inch VisiGlide guide-
wire (Olympus America, San Jose, USA) was
advanced thorough the fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) needle. Tract dilation was performed after
the withdrawal of the FNA needle. A 4F cannula
(Glo-tip, Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, USA)
was inserted over the guidewire for fistula tract
dilation. Thereafter, 6F and 7F biliary dilator
catheters (catheter tip, 4F; Cook Medical) were
inserted over the guidewire and removed, in that
order, to dilate the tract. If there was resistance
to advancement of the 6F dilator catheter, a
triple-lumen needle-knife (Microtome, Boston
Scientific) with a 7F shaft diameter was gently
inserted over the guidewire to dilate the tract by
using a brief burst of pure cutting current. After
fistula tract creation, a straight plastic stent (7­
10F in a diameter × 6­10 cm in length), or a fully
covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS)
with flared ends or anchoring flaps (6­10 mm
diameter × 6­10 cm in length, fully covered with
a silicon membrane, Standard Sci Tech, Seoul,
Korea or MI tech, Seoul, Korea) was placed over
the guidewire. Measurements were taken for the
intrahepatic bile duct diameter at the point of
interest, the hepatic portion length (linear dis-
tance from the mural wall to the punctured bile
duct wall in the measurement of EUS), and bile
duct segment (B2 or B3) for each needle punc-
ture attempt, and procedure times (from initial
bile duct puncture to successful transmural stent-
ing) in each EUS-HGS session. Withdrawal and
repositioning of the EUS fine needle for better
access to transmural stenting was permitted fol-
lowing failed opacification of the bile duct during
contrast injection, the misplacement of the guide-
wire, or a difficult fistula dilation process with
graded dilation. Based on our algorithm [Park
et al. 2011, 2013], the EUS-guided rendezvous
technique was not considered in this cohort with
inaccessible papilla (duodenal invasion or surgi-
cally altered anatomy). EUS-HGS was performed
by a single, experienced endosonographer trained
in both ERCP and EUS. A total of 150 EUS-
guided drainage procedures or FNA (25 pseudo-
cyst drainages and 125 EUS-FNA procedures),
and more than 2500 career ERCPs were carried
out to achieve procedural expertise before com-
mencement of this study [Park et al. 2009, 2011].

Consecutive database (from first case) including
previous published data [Park et al. 2009, 2011,
2013] with conventional fistula dilation tech-
nique (graded dilation or needle knife) were pro-
spectively collected and retrospectively reviewed
to assess the learning curve. Later cases with use
of balloon dilation were not included [Paik et al.
2014]. Learning curves of EUS-HGS were cal-
culated for two main outcome measurements
(procedure time and adverse events) by using the
moving average method, and cumulative sum
(CUSUM) analysis, respectively.
Definition of events
Technical success in EUS-HGS was defined as
successful stent placement following EUS needle
puncture, guidewire placement and fistula tract
dilation at the first attempt of EUS-HGS. Overall
technical success was defined as the successful
completion of the EUS-HGS procedure with
successful stenting, along with the flow of con-
trast medium and/or bile through the stent
regardless of the number of attempts at biliary
access in EUS-HGS. Functional success was
defined as a decrease in bilirubin or alkaline
phosphatase to less than 75% of the pretreatment
value within the first month [Park et al. 2013].
Stent patency was measured from the day on
which the stent for EUS-HGS was placed to the
time of stent dysfunction or patient death.
Procedural adverse events were defined as any
procedure-related adverse events occurring
within two weeks of the procedure, including
cholangitis, bile peritonitis, biloma, bleeding,
pneumoperitoneum, or stent migration [Park
et al. 2011]. These were classified and graded
accordingtoAmericanSocietyforGastrointestinal
Endoscopy workshop reports [Cotton et al.
2010]. Based on these reports, four grades of
severity were classified, based primarily on the
need for hospitalization: mild, events requiring
hospitalization of 1­3 days; moderate, 4­9 days'
hospitalization; severe, more than 10 days' hospi-
talization or requiring surgery or intensive care;
and fatal, death attributable to the procedure
[Cotton et al. 2010]. Late adverse events were
any stent-related complication, such as stent
migration, and stent occlusion, occurring 14 days
after stent placement [Park et al. 2011]. Stent
occlusion was defined as the recurrence of jaun-
dice and cholestasis and/or evidence of a dilated
biliary system on US or CT with a direct view of
the upper endoscope, which in all cases would
require biliary intervention.
Statistical analysis
All of the analyses were performed using SPSS
version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The
results are expressed as mean ± standard devia-
tion. Categorical parameters were compared by
using a chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, and
continuous variables using a t-test. Multivariable
analysis was performed using the logistic regres-
sion method to examine successful EUS-HGS
factors. These EUS-HGS factors were selected
according to our experience. Cumulative patency
duration was estimated using Kaplan-Meier anal-
ysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Time periods were sorted by procedure time and
adverse events to determine the learning curve for
EUS-HGS. Procedure time was analyzed using
the moving average method [Kayano et al. 2011;
Jeon et al. 2016]. A five-case moving averages was
used, as the moving averages for less than five
cases exhibited excessive variation. The moving-
average method removes individual changes and
thus clarifies trends. The optimal cutoff point was
determined based on the moving average trend.
CUSUM analysis was used to evaluate adverse
events for all cases. This is a method of continu-
ously assessing the performance of an individual
or process against a predetermined standard
to detect adverse trends and allow for early
intervention [Park et al. 2015a]. All cases were
ordered chronologically to calculate the CUSUM.
CUSUM was defined as S (Pi
­ P0
), where Pi
is an
individual attempt, and P0
the reference or target
value for the procedure, with Pi
= 1 for failure
(adverse event) and Pi
= 0 for success (no adverse
event). The P0
for the conversion rate was set at
0.1, reflecting a target conversion rate of 10 %.
Therefore, a positive slope would mean failure,
and a negative slope, success. In general, the P0
value is set by using the minimum acceptable cri-
teria to assess the competency [Ward et al. 2014;
Park et al. 2015a]. Thus, the expected incidences
(30%) of adverse events for EUS-HGS were
based on the multicenter report with an experi-
ence < 20 EUS-guided cholangiopancreatogra-
phy [Vila et al. 2012].
Results
A total of 129 patients with a mean age of 62.2 ±
13 years and 81 of whom were male were included
in this study. The baseline characteristics of the
patients and clinical outcomes are summarized in

Tables 1 and 2. A total of 174 attempts were per-
formed in 129 patients. A total of 113 patients
(87.6%) underwent EUS-HGS due to malignant
stricture and the rest (n = 16, 12.4%) due to
benign disease. The indications for EUS-HGS
were failure of guidewire pass across the tight
stricture (n = 52, 40.3%), surgically altered anat-
omy (n = 37, 28.7%), obscured ampulla due to
metallic enteral stent (n = 15, 11.6%), duodenal
obstruction (n = 13, 10.1%), obscured ampulla
due to invasive cancer (n = 10, 7.8%) and
intrahepatic duct (IHD) stones with surgically
altered anatomy (n = 2, 1.6%).
The overall technical success rate was 93%
(120/129) and the functional success rate was
81.4% (105/129). Technical success rate of first
attempt was 64.3% (83/129, intention-to-treat
analysis), and that for second and third attempts
was 82.1% (32/39, intention-to-treat analysis)
and 83.3% (5/6, intention-to-treat analysis),
respectively (Figure 1). The bile duct of segment
2 (B2) was punctured in 49 patients (38%), and
the bile duct of segment 3 (B3) in 80 (62%)
patients (Figure 1). Mean hepatic portion length
on EUS was 27 mm (range 10­47 mm). Mean

EUS was 7.1 mm (range 3­15.7). The mean pro-
cedure time was 30.1 ± 13.1 minutes. FCSEMSs
were placed in 118 of 120 patients (98.3%) and
plastic stents were used in two of 120 patients
(1.7%). Mean stent patency duration was 137.1
± 243.5 days during mean (288.9 ± 358.1 days)
follow-up periods.
Procedural adverse events developed in 32 of the
129 patients (24.8%) and included bacteremia (n
= 16, 12.5%), bleeding from the puncture site (n
= 5, 3.9%), bile peritonitis (n = 4, 3.1%), self-
limited pneumoperitoneum (n = 4, 3.1%) and
intraperitoneal stent migration (n = 3, 2.3%).
With regard to grades of severity, 16 cases
(12.4%) were defined as mild, 14 (10.9%) as
moderate, and 2 (1.6%) as severe. Late adverse
events occurred in 25 of 120 patients (20.8%),
and included distal stent migration (n = 12, 10%)
and stent occlusion (n = 13, 10.8%).
To assess the learning curve for EUS-HGS over
time, the cases were analyzed by the moving aver-
age and CUSUM methods. Based on procedure
time according to the moving average method,
129 EUS-HGS procedures were divided into the

first (1­24) and second period (25­129) (Table 3).
The mean procedure time during the periods was
39.2 ± 12.6 and 28.1 ± 12 minutes, respectively.
Technical proficiency was significantly faster as
procedure experience accumulated (Figure 2).
Based on adverse events according to the CUSUM
method, 129 cases were divided into the first
(1­33) and second period (34­129) (Table 4). The
rates of adverse events were 36.4 % and 20.8 %,
respectively. There were no significant differences
between first and second periods (p = 0.12).
Fluctuation was demonstrated between points
1 and 33 on the slope of the plotted line in the
CUSUM chart. However, the rate of adverse
events stabilized after 33 cases of HGS (Figure 3).
For reaching this number with failed ERCP and
inaccessible papilla, 712 consecutive ERCP cases
for biliary obstruction was required.
We performed multivariate analysis between 120
successful attempts and 54 failed attempts of 174
overall attempts. In the logistic regression model,
intrahepatic bile duct diameter of puncture site
 5 mm [odds ratio (OR) 3.7; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.71­8.1; p < 0.01] and hepatic por-
tion length > 3 cm (OR 5.7; 95% CI 2.7­12; p <
0.01) in all attempts (including first, second, and
third attempt) were associated with low technical
success. Age, sex, cause of obstruction, the pres-
ence of ascites, the lapse of time (group 1 or 2
based on procedure time), and intrahepatic bile
duct segment (B2 or B3) were not associated with
the technical success in EUS-HGS (Table 5).
Discussion
To date, little is known about the optimal biliary
access point and learning curve of EUS-HGS.
Regarding the optimal biliary access point for EUS-
HGS, this technique seems to be similar to precut-
ting for transpapillary biliary cannulation because
of the free-hand technique employed in both proce-
dures. Therefore, EUS-HGS may be more difficult
than EUS-choledochoduodenostomy, requiring a
relatively stable scope position and fixed biliary
access point (duodenal bulb), even in experienced

endosonographers [Park, 2012]. Furthermore, the
absence of studies on the ideal puncture site limit
the general popularity of EUS-HGS, which tends
to be performed only by experts in a few tertiary
centers. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,
this study first evaluated technical proficiency with
time trends for the evaluation of the optimal biliary
access point and the learning curve of EUS-HGS
by single operator.
The overall technical success rate of EUS-HGS
achieved in our study was comparable with that of
previous studies [Park et al. 2010, 2011, 2013;
Paik et al. 2014]. However, the technical success
rate (64.3%, 83/129) of the first attempt was
lower than the overall technical success rate. The
success rate achieved on the first attempt and
subsequent attempts may reflect the effect of a
learning curve because outcomes of all the proce-
dures according to time trends were reported. In
addition, the difference between these success
rates may have resulted from withdrawal and sub-
sequent puncture of the EUS fine needle in 35.7%
of the patients to gain better access to the

EUS-HGSwithtransmuralstenting.Interestingly,
the proportion of multiple attempts (over two) of
needle puncture in each EUS-HGS session
showed an increasing tendency without statistical
significance in this study (group 1 = 25% versus
group 2 = 31.5%, p = 0.55; two periods based on
procedure time). However, the procedure time of
group 2 was significantly shorter than that of
group 1 (28.1 ± 12 in group 2 versus 39.2 ± 12.6
in group 1, p < 0.001; two periods based on pro-
cedure time). Furthermore, the rate of adverse
events showed a decreasing tendency without sta-
tistical significance in group 2 (22.9% in group 2
versus 33.3% in group 1, p = 0.49; two periods
based on procedure time). With the accumula-
tion of an operator's experience of EUS-HGS,
this repositioning of the EUS fine needle for bet-
ter access point of EUS-HGS with transmural
stenting may have related to technical proficiency
achieved without increasing adverse events as in
our previous study [Oh et al. 2016]. The place-
ment of an FCSEMS may be also helpful for
sealing the previously punctured intrahepatic
duct as compared with that of plastic stenting
[Park et al. 2009; Oh et al. 2016]. Functional
success was achieved in 81.4% (105/129) of the
patients. In our study, a substantial number of
patients had an advanced stage of malignancy,
complex type of hilar stricture, or accompanying
duodenal obstruction. These subgroup complexi-
ties may have influenced the functional success
reported in our study.
Adverse events developed in 24.8% (32/129)
patients in the current study, which is comparable
with that cited in other studies [Park et al. 2009,
2011; Vila et al. 2012; Park, 2015]. It was demon-
strated in our previous studies that the use of a
needle knife for fistula dilation in EUS-BD may
be associated with postprocedure adverse events
[Park et al. 2011]. A needle knife was used more
significantly in patients who experienced adverse
events (6/32, 18.8%) as compared with its use in
patients who had not (3/97, 3.1%, p < 0.05). Our
results verify that the risk associated with
EUS-BD, and the use of a needle knife for fistula
dilation in EUS-BD should be avoided if
possible.
The ideal puncture site for EUS-HGS is the most
important technical issue. It is important to iden-
tify the optimal biliary access point in EUS-HGS,
especially for those inexperienced in its use
because the procedure can be accompanied by
significant adverse events such as bile peritonitis,
stent migration, pneumoperitoneum, and cholan-
gitis [Martins et al. 2010; Paik et al. 2014; Hara
et al. 2016]. However, to date, none of the studies
have evaluated the optimal biliary access point
for EUS-HGS. Our data suggest that bile duct
diameter at the point of interest > 5 mm, and
hepatic portion length of 1 cm to  3 cm on EUS
(Figure 4b) might facilitate successful EUS-HGS.
Although shorter hepatic portion length on EUS
has an advantage for puncture the intrahepatic
bile duct, a certain amount of stent must be
located in the hepatic parenchyma to prevent
migration or bile leakage as in PTBD [Ogura
et al. 2015]. As usual, we inserted a metal stent
into the left intrahepatic bile duct of 2 or 3 cm
length with 3 cm length in the luminal portion
during EUS-HGS [Ogura et al. 2015]. This intra-
hepatic bile duct portion is also located in the
hepatic parenchyma. This 2 or 3 cm in the left
intrahepatic bile duct and hepatic portion length
(linear distance from the mural wall to the punc-
tured bile duct wall in the measurement of EUS)
in the hepatic parenchyma was considered to pre-
vent stent migration or bile leakage as in PTBD.
A dilated bile duct may be a prerequisite for suc-
cessful EUS-BD (Figure 4a). However, insuffi-
cient intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was
frequently observed in failed the first attempt of

intrahepatic bile duct diameter was 4.7 mm on endoscopic ultrasound. (b) Endoscopic ultrasound-guided
puncture was performed. The linear distance from the mural wall to the punctured bile duct wall was more
than 3 cm in the measurement of EUS. (c) Failed biliary opacification was demonstrated on fluoroscopy at
the first attempt. (d) Misplacement of the guidewire was also demonstrated on fluoroscopy at the second
attempt. (e, f) Reposition of endoscopic ultrasound FNA needle for better access to the transmural stenting

EUS-HGS. In these circumstances, less than 5
mm of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation should not
be chosen as an optimal biliary access point for
initial puncture with the EUS FNA needle.
Although the B3 approach may be more suitable
for EUS-HGS, a statistically significant difference
in the success rates between B2 and B3 was not
observed [Park, 2015]. Therefore, we evaluated
the parameter for successful fistula dilation and
stent placement. In our previous study [Paik et al.
2014], the distance from the mural wall to the
punctured bile duct may be important for choos-
ing the length of the stent. In this study, additional
steps in the fistula dilation process may be required
for a distance > 3 cm. This distance may repre-
sent the puncture of the central intrahepatic duct,
rather than that of the peripheral intrahepatic
duct. Theoretically, stent deployment may be dif-
ficult in longer distances between the mural wall
and the punctured bile duct because a longer stent
and angulation on stent deployment may be
required. With limited experiences of EUS-HGS,
multiple needle-puncture attempts during EUS-
HGS may have increased the risk of procedure-
related adverse events. Therefore, further multi-
center studies are required to confirm our results,
which build upon the EUS findings with respect
to the first attempt of EUS-HGS.
The results of this study suggest that the technical
proficiency required with regard to procedure time
needed to perform the procedures improved sig-
nificantly with experience after 24 cases (Figure 2).
Although a statistically significant difference was
not noted between the two periods, approximately
33 procedures are needed to acquire the technical
skills for EUS-HGS in order to reach a stabilization
level in terms of adverse events. (Figure 3). This
may be because of the following reasons: (1)
increased familiarity with technical maneuvers,
such as the correct orientation of the echoendo-
scope with respect to the position of the dilated
intrahepatic duct, (2) identifying an appropriate
plane for guidewire manipulation, fistula tract dila-
tion, and stent insertion, (3) the ability to choose
stents of the correct length based on the puncture
site,and(4)increasedexperienceoftheendoscopist.
There were several limitations to this study. First,
the technical proficiency reported in this study
was evaluated by one endosonographer with
expertise in both EUS and ERCP in a large ter-
tiary academic center. Therefore, the number of
EUS-HGSs required to achieve mastery for oper-
ators in a low-ERCP-volume center may have
been underestimated. Thus, a larger, multicenter,
prospective study may be needed to confirm our
results. EUS-HGS can be performed after failed
ERCP. This suggests that evaluation of this proce-
dure is difficult for most low-volume ERCP cent-
ers with trainees. Furthermore, EUS-HGS should
be performed by endosonographers who are
trained in both EUS and ERCP. Therefore, given
these limited resources, we conducted this study
with a large number of EUS-HGS performed by a
single, experienced endosonographer without
experience of EUS-HGS before commencement
of this study. Although the single-operator experi-
ence limits the ability to generalize our results, this
study may have clinical impact on successful and
robust EUS-HGS procedures because our results
may be informative to endoscopists who are start-
ing to perform EUS-HGS with regard to the effi-
cacy and spread of EUS-HGS.
Second, EUS-BD was performed using the con-
ventional fistula dilation process and stent deploy-
ment system in this study. A substantial number
(33 failed ERCP cases with inaccessible papillae
in 712 consecutive ERCP cases for biliary
obstruction) of EUS-HGS for technical profi-
ciency was required owing to the complexity of
the procedure. Therefore, the development of
training models for EUS-HGS are mandatory for
beginners in order to shorten time to technical
proficiency [Dhir et al. 2015]. Furthermore, the
EUS-BD learning curve, using a one-step dedi-
cated device, should be evaluated in a future
study [Park et al. 2015b; Lee et al. 2016].
In conclusion, EUS-HGS may be performed
successfully when the bile duct is approached at
the point of bile duct diameter > 5 mm, with
hepatic portion length being 1 cm to  3 cm on
EUS. Based on our results, performed by a sin-
gle endosonographer, technical proficiency, with
regard to procedure time and adverse events,
may be competent after 33 cases of EUS-HGS
using the conventional fistula-dilation process
and stent deployment system. Given a substan-
tial number of cases requiring a learning curve of
EUS-HGS in this study, various and extensive
endoscopic teaching tools for EUS-HGS such as
an ex vivo hands-on model or interventional
EUS mechanical simulator may be encouraged
prior to self-taught EUS-HGS procedures with-
out supervision.
