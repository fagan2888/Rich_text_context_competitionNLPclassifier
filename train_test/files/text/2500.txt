Abstract
Objectives. We investigate the association between the multigenerational household
context and health of older adults in India, taking into account potential selection effects.
Methods. Using data from the India Human Development Survey (2004­05), a nationally
representative multitopic data set, we employed a two-step analytical strategy--logistic
regression followed by propensity score stratification method--to model the effect of
contrasting living arrangement types on short-term illness.
Results. Overall, older adults living in multigenerational households have the lowest
levels of short-term illness. Among them, those who live with their spouse, adult chil-
dren, and young grandchildren experience the highest health gains. Health advantage
diminishes when older adults live only with a spouse and adult children, and further
diminishes when they live only with their spouse. Solitary living is associated with the
highest likelihood of short-term morbidity. Good health is also shown to be associated
with household wealth, gender, household size, and urban residence.
Discussion. Our study demonstrates that multigenerational households--the traditional
and the most dominant form of living arrangement in India--have protective health
benefits for older adults, while taking into account potential selection mechanisms. On
Contrary to some epidemiological studies, we do not find any elevated risk of exposure to
short-term illness, when older adults are living in households with young grandchildren.

Background
A rich legacy of gerontological scholarship has emphasized
the importance of household structure in old-age support
(Chen & Short, 2008; Tsutsui, Muramatsu, & Higashino,
2014; Vera-Sanso, 2004). India, like many other Asian
societies, nurtures strong traditional filial obligation rooted
in intergenerational coresidence (Croll, 2008; Gupta &
Pillai, 2002; Vera-Sanso, 2004). Specifically, the idea of
"joint" (samyukta kutumb) or "undivided" (avibhakta
kutumb) family system in India has its conceptual roots

in the ancient belief of Dharma where older parents are
expected to be treated with respect for their age and wisdom
(Bisht & Sinha, 1981) and caregiving is traditionally com-
manded. India is also experiencing globalization led changes
such as rapid urbanization and out-migration of younger
adults that are often associated with a rise in nuclear liv-
ing and diminishing preference for intergenerational coresi-
dence (Adams, 2010; Bongaarts & Zimmer, 2002; Goode,
1963). How these forces are changing the Indian family sys-
tem stand contested (Allendorf, 2013; Caldwell, Reddy, &
Caldwell, 1984; Shah, 1996); but most researchers would
agree that it raises critical questions about the caregiving
framework of older adults, especially given that the share
of India's older adult population (ages 60 and above) is pro-
jected to climb from 8% in 2010 (around 80 million) to
19% (encompassing 323 million people) in 2050 (Bloom
2011;Population Reference Bureau, 2012). However, inad-
equate government funded institutional support (e.g., social
security provisions, health insurance, and public health sys-
tems) have increased health and economic vulnerabilities of
older Indians (Bloom et al., 2010; Irudaya Rajan, 2007).
These emerging sociocultural and demographic trends make
India an excellent site to examine the link between house-
hold structure and health of older persons.
The linkage between coresidence and older adult wellbe-
ing lacks conceptual and empirical clarity. For example, in
settings where public or private formal systems of care are
inadequate, coresidence is often associated with (i) higher
levels of material well-being and, (ii) higher probability of
receiving informal support that are directly dependent on
physical proximity (Chen & Short, 2008; UN DESA, 2005;
Yount, 2009). At the same time, other studies report no clear
gain for older people from coresidence, especially in terms of
healthcare or support in activities of daily living (Hashimoto,
1991; Kochar, 1999; Sibai et al., 2009). Given this empirical
conundrum and a resilient cultural context of multigenera-
tional living and family-based old-age support in India, we
ask: Does living in a multigenerational household really have
protective health benefits for older adults in India?
Though descriptive studies on the patterns and changes of
living arrangements are not entirely new in India (Agarwal,
2012; Irudaya Rajan & Kumar, 2003; Irudaya Rajan, 2006;
Sathyanarayana, Kumar, & James, 2012), a systematic
examination of living arrangements and health has been
missing. This omission reflects a general belief that older
adults are automatically provided for in multigenerational
households (Kochar, 1999) and hence enjoy better health.
In this article, we empirically question this belief and in the
process offer a nuanced classification of multigenerational
households to examine its differential effect on health of
older Indians. In particular, we argue that previous studies
on living arrangement and health have made limited efforts
in adjusting for confounding effects. For instance, a positive
association between coresidence and good health could be
confounded by wealth, i.e., if multigenerational households
are wealthier than the nuclear ones, older adults coresiding
in multigenerational households are more likely to report
better health than those living alone or only with spouse.
Additionally, selection bias could lead to less healthier
adults living in multigenerational households. For example,
one could argue that older people who are more prone to
illness (and hence in need for higher levels of assistance) are
more likely to coreside with adult children.
Drawing data from a cross sectional survey--India
Human Development Survey (2004­05)--we adopt pro-
pensity score stratification technique in addition to the
standard regression models. After adjusting for selection,
we find evidence of a positive association between multi-
generational living and good health among older Indians.
We conclude by emphasizing the need to examine the path-
ways through which these health gains are reaped in multi-
generational settings.
Living Arrangements and Health of Older Adults:
Theoretical Considerations
Coresidence with adult children may serve as the best means
of ensuring the day-to-day needs of the older population
are met in developing societies (UN DESA, 2005). Family
sociologists (Palloni, 2002; Palloni & De Vos, 2003) suggest
that coresidence is one among many social transfers towards
older parents that originate within the boundaries of the kin
group. Multigenerational families may act as a "convoy"
(Antonucci et al., 1987) that helps the aged successfully
negotiate life's challenges in terms of monetary and non-
monetary support (e.g., care during illnesses). Older adults
can gain access to both economic capital (e.g., household
income, loans, and investments) and embodied cultural cap-
ital (knowledge and good practices learned through expo-
sure to extra-familial networks) thereby further enhancing
positive outcomes within a multigenerational setting.
Furthermore, family support as a form of social capi-
tal (Bourdieu, 1985) may also provide intergenerational
solidarity (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991) through normative,
functional and structural dimensions of family support.
Parent­child interactions are limited not only to affection,
resource-sharing, and emotional support but also extend to
familism (norms or expectations of individual obligations to
the family). Arguably, the demand for coresidence as a source
of social capital may be heightened in societies with a domi-
nant sense of filial obligation. Since these societies are often
characterized by low levels of elderly-care infrastructure, lim-
ited social provisions and high levels of out-of-pocket health
expenditure (Chemali, Chahine, & Sibai, 2008; Irudaya
Rajan, 2006), family support emerges as a crucial alternative.
Living Arrangements and Health of Older Adults:
Studies from India and beyond
A rich set of studies (Irudaya Rajan & Kumar, 2003;
Sathyanarayana et al.,2012) have focused on how headship,

household size, and marital status are associated with the
living arrangements of older Indians. A related body of lit-
erature, gradually gaining currency is the link between fam-
ily structure, social networks, and older adult well-being
(Berkman, Sekher, Capistrant, & Zheng, 2012; Samanta,
2014; Sudha, Suchindran, Mutran, Raja, & Sharma, 2006).
Early studies of Gupta & Vohra (1987) and Shah (1993)
have provided region/city specific empirical estimates of
disease burden among older persons. With the availability
of nationally representative data (National Sample Survey,
52nd Round, 1995­96) on chronic ailments and disability
among older adults, later studies (Irudaya Rajan, 2006)
have provided detailed description of the disease profile
of older persons. Surprisingly, a simultaneous examination
of the household structure and health is missing from the
empirical sociological/gerontological literature on India.
Exceptions include Sen & Noon (2007) and Pal (2004).
Specifically, Sen & Noon (2007) found that older adults in
extended family settings enjoyed significant health advan-
tage through lower likelihood of illness but no clear gains
in terms of treatment seeking behavior. Pal (2004) con-
cluded that coresiding with adult children was often associ-
ated with higher household incomes, but the likelihood of
a coresidential arrangement was determined by the older
parents' financial assets and property ownership.
Overall, in other settings where intergenerational ties
are traditionally strong, coresiding with adult children has
shown to have beneficial effects on the wellbeing of older
persons despite changing socioeconomic conditions. For
example, rural Taiwanese elders living alone had higher
levels of stress than elders in other types of living arrange-
ments (Hermalin & Yang, 2004). In China, older adults liv-
ing alone were disadvantaged in all measures of physical
and emotional health (Cui, 2002; Chen & Short, 2008),
highlighting the importance of family and cultural context
to the wellbeing of the older persons. Furthermore, studies
of gender differences in coresidence (Knodel & Ofstedal,
2003; Sibai et al., 2009) have emphasized that older women
not only have higher likelihoods of living with adult chil-
dren but also experience better wellbeing outcomes than
older men, primarily because of older women's poorer
health, widowhood status and fewer economic resources.
Curiously, although family support for the aged has
remained the traditional ideal type for most develop-
ing societies, a handful of studies on Asia, Africa, and the
Middle East have reported less conclusive findings on the
association between coresidence and older adult wellbe-
ing. Specifically, Kochar (1999) in her analysis of familial
support for medical expenditure of older persons in rural
Pakistan, Hashimoto (1991) in a seven-country study and
Sibai and colleagues (2009) in Lebanon found that any
benefits from coresidence for older adult wellbeing were
unclear.
A contrary line of research emerges from epidemiological
studies (Cohen et al., 2011; Goodman & Silverstein, 2002)
that argue that older adults living in multigenerational
households are more prone to illness due to the presence
of young children. These studies demonstrate a consistent
association between coresidential grand parenting and the
spread of influenza and other respiratory infections, even
after controlling for socioeconomic status. Where coresi-
dential living is prevalent, it is reasonable to assume that
older adults suffering from chronic disease or disability
would be more likely to coreside with their adult children
and grandchildren. Since chronic disease and disability
are often positively associated with short-term morbidity,
higher rates of coresidence would imply increased short-
term illnesses for older adults living with adult children.
A review of earlier work clearly demonstrates that while
the association between living arrangement and older
adult well-being remains somewhat mixed, positive asso-
ciations are more common than negative ones. This study
departs from earlier research by developing a typology of
household classification which captures the heterogeneity
of Indian multigenerational households. In addition, we
attempt to estimate the effect of confounding in a cross-
sectional study design with a two-step approach: regression
analysis followed by propensity score stratification.
Methods
Data
We rely on the India Human Development Survey (2004­
05; henceforth IHDS) for our empirical investigation. The
IHDS was carried out between 2004 and 2005 by research-
ers from the University of Maryland and the National
Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER, India).
The nationally representative survey fielded face-to-face
interviews with people from 41,554 households located
in 33 states and union territories, 384 districts, 1,503 vil-
lages, and 971 urban blocks located in 276 towns and cit-
ies in India. The survey collected information on income,
consumption, employment, health, and different aspects of
gender and family relationships from both male and female
respondents. Data on a total of 215,754 individuals were
collected from these households. For detailed information
on the study design see Desai and colleagues (2010).
The IHDS administered two sets of questionnaires: a
household economic questionnaire and a health and educa-
tion questionnaire. The household economic questionnaire
was administered to the individual with the most knowl-
edge of household income and expenditures, typically, the
male head of household. Our living arrangement variable
is constructed from the household roster, where all house-
hold members were identified by their relationship to the
household head.
Health information including questions on short-term
illnesses of any family members in the last 30 days, were
collected in the education and health questionnaire, typi-
cally administered to the wife of the household head. In the
absence of the older woman in multigenerational house-
holds, proxy reports were collected from a daughter or a
939

daughter-in-law. Some differences in reporting of illness
were observed between older women and their daughters or
daughters-in-law; to adjust for this potential difference we
include the identity of the respondent as a control variable.
The older adult sample (individuals aged 60 and above)
includes 17,904 persons of which 8,963 are older males
and 8,941 are older females. Older adults constitute about
8% of the weighted sample. Regional variations in the
proportion of older adults are marked; ranging from 13%
in the southern state of Kerala to 5% in the north-eastern
state of Assam.
Measures
We focus on conceptualizing the "living arrangement" vari-
able by building on earlier research (e.g., Chen & Short,
2008; UN DESA, 2005), but at the same time sharpening
our focus on the heterogeneity of multigenerational house-
holds. We classify living arrangement into six mutually
exclusive groups:
1. Living alone: Older adults who are living on their own;
2. Living with spouse only: Older adults who are living
only with their spouse;
3. Living with spouse and adult children: Those living
with their spouses and adult children only;
4. Multigenerational living with spouse, adult children,
and young grandchildren: Older persons in multigen-
erational households where they are living with their
spouses, adult children, and at least one grandchild
whose age is 8 years or younger.
5. Multigenerational living with spouse, adult children
and no young grandchildren: Older adults in multi-
generational households where they are living with
their spouses, adult children, and others (e.g. nephew/
niece, siblings, servants, and other relatives) but without
younger grandchildren. That is, this category explicitly
excludes any minors of age 8 or below.
6. Living with others: A residual category of older adults
in households which do not belong to the any of the
preceding categories. Figure 1 shows the living arrange-
ments of the older persons in the IHDS sample for the
year 2004­05.
These six categories will help us examine how variations
in age groups and familial forms have differential effects
on the health of older adults. For example, in addition to
investigating the differential effects of solitary living ver-
sus living with a spouse, the current typology will help us
understand if different types of coresidence with younger
generations (i.e., categories 3, 4, and 5) have varying levels
of health outcomes for older persons. Categories 4 and 5
have been separated out to examine if older adults living
with younger (below the age of 8) grandchildren are at a
higher risk of infection exposure than those coresiding only
with adult members. This enables us to examine the epi-
demiological dimension of the living arrangement­health
relationship. Similarly, living arrangement categories 3 and
4 distinguish whether the coresidence with grandchildren
(or lack thereof) shape elderly health outcomes through
positive lifestyle changes (e.g., quit smoking or drinking) or
physical strain (as a result of caregiving responsibilities) as
suggested by studies on grand-parenthood in Asia (Chen &
Liu, 2012; Ku et al., 2013).
Based on this conceptualization of living arrangements,
our data indicates that about 2% (n = 398) of older adults
live alone, about 9% (n = 1,647) live only with their
spouse, about 11% (n = 1,999) live with spouse and adult
children, about 30% (n = 5,299) coreside in multigenera-
tional households with their spouse, adult children, and
young grandchildren, about 25% (n = 4,542) coreside in
multigenerational households that include their spouse,
adult children, and others (e.g., nephew/niece, siblings, and
other relatives), but without younger grandchildren, and
finally, about 22 percent (n = 4,019) of older adults are
in households that include a combination of familial and

nonfamilial members apart from the spouse. Hence, the
overall story is one of coresidence with younger genera-
tions in a multigenerational setting.
We study health in terms of short-term morbidity:
cough, fever, or diarrhea. The likelihood of being sick with
one of these minor illnesses is defined as a categorical vari-
able that takes the value of "1" if a person was sick in the
last 30 days and "0" if they remained healthy. The IHDS
data indicates about 11% of older adults reported short-
term morbidity in the last 30 days. Our focus on short-
term morbidity reduces the problem of endogeneity, as it is
unlikely, that short-term morbidity among older adults will
motivate their living arrangement decisions. Hence, short-
term morbidity is more plausibly a consequence of living
arrangements rather than a cause, although the possibility
of reverse causation cannot be altogether ruled out.
Control variables in the current analysis include house-
hold background characteristics-caste, religion, place of
residence (rural/urban) as well as individual characteris-
tics (gender, education, employment, and marital status) of
the older person. Household wealth is measured using a
count of consumer goods owned by the household from a
list of 30 household goods and amenities; household goods
such as a chair or table, television, car, credit card, etc.,
and household amenities such as a flush toilet, LPG, and
electricity. Education is measured by completed years of
schooling ranging from 0= no education through 15 years=
graduate. Marital status is measured as a two category var-
iable, currently married, and widowed/single. Other mari-
tal status categories, such as divorced, separated, or absent
spouse are merged with the widowed/single category as
their sample sizes are extremely small (very low divorce
rates among the older cohorts). Additional income received
by older persons, such as a pension, has been measured by
receipt of any government pension including National Old
Age Pension (NOAP), disability pension or the widow pen-
sion in the last 12 months.
India has a stratified society and social distances in
terms of residential segregation, language, identity forma-
tion, and occupations still separate upper and lower castes
or Hindus and Muslims (Bayly, 2001; Beteille, 1992; Drez
& Sen, 2013). This paper distinguishes five major caste
groups-high caste Brahmin 7.28%, other backward castes
(OBC) 40.2%, scheduled castes (SC) 17.7 %, scheduled
tribes (ST) 6.3%, and other castes (28.3%). In the Indian
caste system, the OBCs, STs, and SCs are considered to be
lower order social groups and SCs and STs are typically at
the bottom on most indicators of well-being (Desai et al.,
2010: 208). Religion has been classified into five major
groups: Hindu (81%), Muslim (11%), Christian (3 %),
Sikh (3%), and other religion (2%). Respondents are clas-
sified as living in rural (65%) or urban (35%) areas based
on the Indian census definition. Additionally, models also
control for the older person's work status conceptualized as
economic participation in any sector including wage or sal-
ary work, household business, farm work, or animal care.
Residential arrangements vary widely across India so
we control for the rural or urban place of residence and
state dummies for 22 major states in all regression models.
Health studies on India have consistently demonstrated that
health outcomes are consequences not only of household
level factors but also of the larger regional context within
which individuals are embedded (Parashar, 2005).Table 1
provides descriptive statistics of the dependent and inde-
pendent variables.
Analytical Strategy
The study follows a two-step analytical strategy to
empirically test the association between living arrange-
ments and health of older people. In the first step, we esti-
mate a logistic regression model using our six category
typology as the key independent variable. The goal is to
understand the several different effects of living arrange-
ment types on the probability of short-term illness among
older persons, after controlling for socioeconomic and
demographic correlates. In the second step, we perform a
stratified propensity score analysis to adjust for potential
selection effects.

Propensity score methods borrow the language of exper-
iments, i.e., treatment group and the control (or untreated)
group. In our case, both "treatment" and "control" are dif-
ferent living arrangement types, utilizing the same six cate-
gory living arrangement typology as the logistic regression.
Specifically, the "control" is the multigenerational living
arrangement type where older adults co-reside with their
spouse, adult children, and grandchildren (includes at least
one grandchild whose age is 8 years or lower), while the
different treatment groups are the remaining contrasting
living arrangement categories. The logic of propensity score
methods is based on the influential counterfactual frame-
work of Neyman-Rubin where propensity score is defined
as the conditional probability of receiving treatment given
observed covariates (see Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983).
Once propensity scores have been estimated, if the treated
and controlled groups have similar propensity scores, the
observed covariates are automatically controlled.Therefore
any differences between "treatment" and "control" groups
may be attributed to the receipt of treatment and not as a
result of observed covariates, thus accomplishing improved
control for confounding (Guo et al., 2010).
For the purpose of this analysis, we have used psmatch2
(Leuven & Sianesi, 2003), a user developed program avail-
able in STATA, which includes pscore and att programs.
Results
Results from Logistic Regression Analysis
In our preliminary analyses, we experimented with differ-
ent reference categories of the living arrangement typology.
We report results from the model where coresiding in a
multigenerational household with spouse, adult children,
and grandchildren (includes younger grandchildren) was
treated as the baseline category. This model provides com-
pelling evidence in support of our hypothesis of a positive
association between multigenerational living and good
health. Hence for the sake of parsimony and clarity, we pre-
sent odds ratios only for this model in Table 2. The logistic
regression model controls for demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors, such as age, gender, marital status, educa-
tion, pension provisions, place of residence, and wealth.
For the logistic regression, the overwhelming story is
that coresidence in a multigenerational household (with
spouse, adult children and at least one grandchildren aged
8 or lower) is associated with the highest health gains
for older persons. Our household classification typology
facilitates a ranking of this health advantage thereby high-
lighting the differential health effects of the heterogene-
ous familial forms. Compared to the baseline category
(coresiding with spouse, adult children, and young grand-
children), older adults living with spouse, adult children
and others, but no young grandchildren (category 5 in the
typology) are 1.002 times as likely (OR: 1.002; p < .05) to
get sick, holding all other variables constant. The health
effect marginally worsens (OR: 1.369; p < 0.001) when
older adults are living with spouse and adult children
(category 3 in the typology) and worsens further (OR:
1.624; p < .001) when they are living only with a spouse
(category 2 in the typology). As demonstrated in earlier
research (Chen & Short, 2008), solitary living is asso-
ciated with worst health outcomes; they are more than
three times as likely to fall sick (OR: 3.262; p < .001) as
their counterparts coresiding with spouse, adult children,
and grandchildren, holding all other variables constant.
Consistent with studies conducted on Asia, living with a
spouse has protective health effects, suggesting the crucial
role of the spouse as a support provider (UN DESA, 2005)
and the general health benefits associated with marriage

Weinick, 1998; Waite, 1995).
Similarly, the total number of persons living in the house-
hold (OR
no. of persons
:0.957, p < .001) has a positive effect on
older adult health even beyond the considerable positive
effects of multigenerational living as discussed above. Thus,
multigenerational households improve older adults' health
in part because they are larger, but also because of the sup-
ports uniquely available in intergenerational living arrange-
ments. Though not explored in this article, the independent
effects of (adult) kin availability may come in terms of bet-
ter health awareness, greater degree of attention and over-
all help in day to day activities of older persons. This is
consistent with previous studies (UN DESA, 2005) on the
developing world, where kin availability seems to play an
important role in determining living arrangements.
Finally, contrary to the epidemiological concerns of
disease risk, out study showed that older adults in mul-
tigenerational households with younger (aged 8 or lower)
grandchildren have similar odds of being sick as those with-
out young grandchildren suggesting that increased likelihood
of infection due to younger grandchildren does not seem to
produce an empirically observable effect. We refrain from
interpreting the health effect of living arrangement category
6 (living with unspecified others) due to the ambiguous mix
of familial and nonfamilial bonds in those households.
Our results also shows that sociodemographic controls
such as gender, urban place of residence, the number of
coresiding persons, and greater household wealth are sig-
nificant factors improving the good health of older Indians.
These findings are consistent across all logistic regression
models that we fitted as part of our preliminary analyses
(results not reported). For example, Table 2 demonstrates
that an older woman has higher odds of being ill than an
older man (OR
female
: 1.379, p < .001). Considering the patri-
archal structure and the associated cultural and economic
dependence on husbands and (male) children (Lamb, 1999;
Sengupta & Agree, 2003), perhaps it is no surprise why
older women are likely to experience higher morbidity risks.
As expected, older persons who live in wealthier house-
holds (OR
standard of living
: 0.560, p < .001) or who are located in
urban areas (OR
urban
:0.752, p < .001) (and hence enjoy mod-
ern sanitation facilities, clean fuel and generally have better
access to healthcare) appear to have lower odds of being sick
with cough, fever, or diarrhea than those from poorer house-
holds and those residing in rural areas. Education seems to
be a surprisingly marginal factor in influencing health out-
comes. This finding is consistent with earlier work on socio-
economic correlates of living arrangements in the developing
world (UN DESA, 2005), where no clear pattern emerged
between educational attainment and living arrangement.
Results from Propensity Score Stratification
Analysis
We adopt propensity score stratification technique to
examine if the dominant finding of the protective role of
multigenerational households, as obtained from the pre-
vious logistic regression analysis, is consistent, even after
controlling for confounding factors. Typically, researchers
(Landrum & Ayanian, 2002) have used quintiles of esti-
mated propensity scores to create strata. But given the dis-
tribution of the propensity score in the study sample, we
have created the strata such that there are adequate cases
in both the "treatment" and "control" groups. In particular,
we define the "control" group as the (multigenerational)
living arrangement category in which the older adult is
coresiding with the spouse, adult children and young grand-
children (category 4 in the typology). The "treatment"
groups are the remaining contrasting living arrangement
categories. In particular,"Treatment 1" is the solitary living
category, "Treatment 2" is living with spouse, "Treatment
3" is living with spouse and adult children, "Treatment 5"
is living with spouse and adult children, but without young
grandchildren. We do not include living with (unspeci-
fied) others category (category 6 in the typology) in this
analysis. Consistent with the previous regression analysis,
we generate propensity scores for each pair of "control"
and "treatment" groups by estimating a series of propen-
sity score models. Again, this is done to investigate if the
likelihood of being sick can be attributed to the differing
living arrangement types, after controlling for confounding
from other individual and household levels variables, such
as age, gender, marital status and wealth. In the propensity
score methods, comparisons across groups are made only
for households basically similar on these variables whereas
the logistic regression models compare all households even
those where the control variables do not overlap much
between household types.
Table 3 describes the treatment (and control) sample
sizes for each propensity score stratum. For instance, in
the first propensity score stratum [0.00 0.125), the "con-
trol" group (i.e. coresiding with spouse, adult children and
young grandchildren) has a sample size of 3,107 and the
associated "treatment 2" group (i.e. living with spouse
only) has a sample size of 215. Again for the same stratum,
the "control" group has a sample size of 1,083, while the
"treatment 3" group (i.e. living with spouse and adult chil-
dren) has a sample size of 90.
Estimates of the overall impact of living arrangement
types on short-term illness were obtained by calculat-
ing a weighted average of the stratum specific differences
(Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984) and are reported in Table 4.
Specifically, both Column A and B show difference in short-
term illness between "control" and "treatment" groups, but
they differ by the weighting strategy. Column A is weighted
by the overall sample size of the propensity score stratum
whereas Column B is weighted by the sample size of the
treatment. Both weighting strategies are reported to dem-
onstrate statistical robustness and the results are consistent.
Overall, after controlling for confounding, results from
the propensity analysis echo the ones found in our previ-
ous logistic regression analysis. The control group, (multi-
generational living with spouse, adult children and young
943
Journals of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 2015, Vol. 70, No. 6
grandchildren), is associated with the lowest probability of
being sick compared to each of the treatment groups. The
difference is smallest for the group living with a spouse and
adult children but no young grandchildren, who have only
about a 1% point higher likelihood of falling sick than the
control group. Again, compared to the control group, those
living with a spouse and adult children have less than 6%
point higher chance of short-term illness and those living
only with their spouse have about a 6­10% point higher
chances of short-term illness that those in the multigenera-
tional control group. Solitary living is again associated with
highest probability of being ill: about a 25% point higher
chance than the control group.
Discussion
In a cultural context where coresidence is common and
intergenerational social contract is expected and main-
tained, the general understanding is that living in a mul-
tigenerational household will contribute to health gains.
The benefits, as some international studies suggest, come in
the form of material advantage, intrafamily support trans-
fers, better health awareness, active grandparenting roles,
healthier lifestyles, and help with day to day activities as a
result of physical proximity (Chen & Liu, 2012; Chen &
Short, 2008; Knodel & Ofstedal, 2003; UN DESA, 2005;
Yount, 2009). Yet another set of studies show negative or
no clear health advantage for older adults living in a mul-
tigenerational setting, highlighting selection, both change
and continuity of demographic realities, normative con-
texts, and socioeconomic environments (Hashimoto, 1991;
Kochar, 1999; Sibai et al., 2009).
Given this empirical ambiguity about the potential of
household structure as an important determinant of older
adult health, we asked: if the traditionally preferred mul-
tigenerational living arrangement has health benefits for
older adults in India, a country that is experiencing dra-
matic economic and societal transformations? Our answer
to this question is a qualified yes. The substantive finding
from our two-step analyses (logistic regression followed by
propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects), is
that multigenerational households provide highest health
gains to older Indians. We extend earlier work on living
arrangements by examining the heterogeneity of multigen-
erational living by separating out those living with young
grandchildren and those without, in addition to specify-
ing the other conventional living arrangement categories
adopted by most studies. This greater detail enables us to
test if living in a multigenerational household with grand-
children has any differential effect on their health as com-
pared to each other living arrangement types.
First, consistent with the existing literature (Chen &
Short, 2008), our findings from both the logistic regres-
sion as well as propensity score analysis show that soli-
tary living is associated with highest likelihood of being
sick. Living with spouse reduces the health disadvantage.
Though, contrary to studies in the West, where living with
spouse is shown to be the optimal living arrangement, liv-
ing with both spouse and adult children is more beneficial
in the Indian context. In particular, living with grand-
children (three generation households) is better than liv-
ing with adult children only (two generation households).
This could be as a result of more active lifestyles adopted
by older grandparents--who might also be caregivers--
greater support received in day to day activities and health
awareness through closer family ties, interaction, and the
companionship of grandchildren (Chen & Liu, 2012; Ku
et al., 2013; Silverstein et al., 2006)

Additionally, young ages of grandchildren do not appear
to produce detrimental health effects on older members in
the household. In particular, older adults in multigenera-
tional households with grandchildren are as likely to fall sick
as those without grandchildren, suggesting that the elevated
risk of infection due to younger children does not produce
an empirically observable effect. This finding is contrary to
what has been suggested by several epidemiological studies
on coresident grand parents with elevated risks of infec-
tion from younger grandchildren. Our explanation to this
unusual finding is that most of such studies have been in
the West, where multigenerational households are rare and
formed often as a response to financial difficulties, illness,
divorce and adolescent childbearing (Cohen et al., 2011;
Goodman & Silverstein, 2002). For these households, the
significantly worse health conditions among grandparents
may in part reflect their low socioeconomic status (Hughes
et al., 2007). However, in India, multigenerational house-
holds are generally wealthier (Sathyanarayana et al., 2012;
also found in this study) which may account for the rever-
sal in the observed effect.
We note some limitations of this study. Though we
confirm the empirical validity of a positive association
between multigenerational living and good health, we
have not yet addressed the pathways through which this
is achieved. The statistical models have been able to rule
out possibilities of confounding (e.g., wealth, age, and
disease risk), but we have not delineated the pathways.
Intergenerational ties and support transfers are com-
plex, dialectical processes, and a careful examination
of these mechanisms remained outside the scope of this
study. Although we observe a differential health advan-
tage between three-generation (i.e., with grandchildren)
versus two-generation (i.e., only adult children) house-
holds, we did not examine the motivating factors, which
could be rooted in issues of grandparenthood, gender
role expectations, and family dynamics. We believe these
remain important themes for future research efforts in
gerontological research in India.
We have earlier argued that this study has provided
stronger empirical support for the association between
multigenerational coresidence and the good health of
older persons in India. This is not to suggest that we have
established causality. Rather, we would like to note that
even though propensity score methods balance observed
covariates between control and treatment groups (and
hence reduce the effects of confounding), they still can-
not balance unmeasured characteristics (Guo & Fraser,
2010; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). Hence, even
after adjusting for confounding, interpretation of the
results of this study can best be described as supporting
an association and not causation. We expect that the high-
quality panel data initiatives underway (e.g., WHO-SAGE
and LASI) will provide a useful next step to investigate
these causal mechanisms more appropriately. These limi-
tations notwithstanding, evidence from this investigation
highlights the importance of multigenerational households
in shaping health outcomes of older Indians. Identifying
crucial pathways will considerably advance future research
in the realm of intergenerational ties, grandparenthood,
and family relations in India.
