Abstract
Objective: To assess the effectiveness of resistin in predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis.
Methods: Patients with acute pancreatitis who presented at the Gastroenterology Clinic,
Erzurum Education and Research Hospital, Turkey were enrolled in this prospective study. White
blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and resistin levels were measured on admission and at
24 h, day 3 and day 7 following admission, along with other blood parameters. Patients were
divided into two groups: mild acute pancreatitis and moderate/severe acute pancreatitis.
Results: Of 59 patients with acute pancreatitis (mild, n ¼ 37; moderate/severe, n ¼ 22), significant
between-group differences were found in terms of resistin and CRP levels. Receiver operating
curve analysis showed that resistin levels were better for predicting severe cases of acute
pancreatitis than CRP or WBC levels on day 3 (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 versus 0.81 and
0.63, respectively). Resistin levels on day 3 were better than CRP levels for predicting necrosis
development (AUC, 0.70 versus 0.69, respectively).
Conclusions: Resistin may represent a new, effective indicator to predict the severity of acute
pancreatitis and presence of necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.

Introduction
Acute pancreatitis is a common disease with
a highly variable clinical course. Most cases
of acute pancreatitis are mild and resolve
spontaneously (or following supporting
treatments) without complications. The clin-
ical outlook is less favourable, however, in
the 10­20% of cases that are associated with
organ failure and heightened morbidity.1­3

Rating systems and serum markers are
used in conjunction with clinical, laboratory
and radiological findings in order to predict
the severity of clinical progression in cases of
acute pancreatitis.4­6 One acute-phase react-
ant, C-reactive protein (CRP), is a com-
monly used marker for distinguishing
between a mild and severe acute pancreatitis
attack. Damage to the pancreas in acute
pancreatitis and the intensity of the organ-
ism response (i.e., the acute-phase response)
is accompanied by a substantial increase in
the serum CRP level, which is the most
significant reactant in this response, as a
result of hepatocyte stimulation by cyto-
kines. In acute inflammation, CRP levels
often reach their peak at 48 h.7,8
Improved knowledge of the roles of
cytokines has increased understanding of
the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
White adipose tissue is a multifunctional
organ that releases protein signals and fac-
tors such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin,
ghrelin and apelin on a vast scale.9
Changes in the function and quantity of
these proteins plays a role in the pathogen-
esis and progress of inflammation, inflam-
matory response, insulin resistance and
metabolic syndrome.10 Resistin is a newly
identified peptide hormone, secreted specif-
ically by adipocytes,11 that can cause obesity
and hypertriglyceridaemia, due to its asso-
ciation with insulin resistance.12,13 Studies
have revealed that resistin is also an import-
ant cytokine in inflammatory reactions, and
in the regulation of other cytokines.14­16
The aim of the present study was to assess
the effectiveness of resistin in predicting the
severity of acute pancreatitis, and to com-
pare resistin with CRP in predicting the
severity of acute pancreatitis.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective observational study
included patients with acute pancreatitis
who presented to the Gastroenterology
Clinic of Erzurum Education and Research
Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey, between
November 2012 and December 2013.
Patients whose diagnoses were verified
through clinic and laboratory findings, and
who met the criteria for study inclusion,
were sequentially enrolled.
Inclusion criteria for the study com-
prised the presence of clinical findings,
typical history, body mass index (BMI)
between 20 and 25, a more than three-fold
increase in serum amylase and lipase
values, and verification of the monitoring
methods. Exclusion criteria included iron
deficiency anaemia, renal failure, liver dis-
ease, chronic pancreatitis, a second or later
pancreatitis attack, symptoms lasting >3
days prior to admission, and a diagnosis
that was not verified through monitoring
methods.
Upper abdominal ultrasonography was
conducted on admission, and computed
tomography (CT) was performed on day 4
or 5 following admission. Biochemical par-
ameters were assessed using two different
blood samples taken within the first 2 h
following presentation and at a time
between the first 2 and 72 h, based on
when the patient was admitted to hospital.
Each patient's age, sex and reason for
hospital admission were recorded.
Each patient was evaluated by monitor-
ing with the Balthazar CT rating system and
CT severity index, and pancreatic necrosis
assessment. The patients were divided into
two groups based on the Atlanta classifica-
tion.17 The first group included patients
without complications (mild acute pancrea-
titis); the second group included patients
with one or several organ failures (moderate
or severe acute pancreatitis).
Approval for the study was obtained
from the Ethical Committee of Erzurum
Regional Education and Research Hospital.
All patients participating in the study pro-
vided written informed consent.

Blood samples and tests
Blood samples were collected from each
patient a total of four times: on admission
(0 h), day 1 (24 h), day 3 (72 h) and day 7
(168 h) following admission. Blood (10 ml)
was drawn into heparin-treated tubes by
venepuncture and, within 1.5 h following
collection, a 5-ml portion of the sample
was centrifuged for 10 min at 1 700 g at
25C. The plasma was then collected and
stored at À80C prior to analysis. All
plasma samples were analysed within 12
months. For routine blood parameter
measurements, blood samples were col-
lected into tubes containing ethylenediami-
netetra-acetic acid to prevent clotting.
Complete blood counts (white blood cell
[WBC] and haematocrit), CRP and resistin
levels, and routine examination results for
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phos-
phatase (ALP), g-glutamyltransferase
(g-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bili-
rubin, amylase, blood urea nitrogen, cre-
atinine, Na, K, calcium and glucose were
obtained.
White blood cell and thrombocyte counts
were measured automatically using standard
methods with a CoulterÕ LH 780 analyser
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
Amylase, lipase, albumin, creatinine, LDH,
AST, ALT, glucose, ALP, g-GT, and bili-
rubin values were determined using photo-
metric methods with a Roche PP800
autoanalyser (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) in the routine bio-
chemistry laboratory of Erzurum Education
and Research Hospital. CRP levels were
measured nephelometrically using a
Beckman Coulter IMAGEÕ 800 system.
Plasma resistin levels were measured
using a human resistin ELISA (Catalogue
number: RD191016100; BioVendor-
Laboratorni Medicina a.s., Bmo, Czech
Republic), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as n patient incidence,
mean (range) or mean Æ SD. Kolmogorov­
Smirnov test was used to assess normality of
the data. Between-group comparisons of
serum resistin values were performed using
Mann­Whitney U-test, as the serum resistin
values did not show normal distribution.
The association between categorical vari-
ables was assessed using 2-test or Fisher's
exact test. Receiver operating curves (ROC)
were drawn in order to determine the opti-
mum cut-off points to reach high sensitivity
and specificity values. The area under the
curve (AUC) was calculated using the 95%
confidence interval (CI). All analyses were
two-tailed and performed using SPSSÕ soft-
ware, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
The present study included 59 patients with
acute pancreatitis (37 with mild acute pan-
creatitis; 22 with moderate or severe acute
pancreatitis, based on the Atlanta classifica-
tion17). Patient's clinical and biochemical
characteristics are shown in Table 1. A
statistically significant difference in terms
of age was observed between patients with
mild acute pancreatitis (mean, 63.7 years
[range, 18­94]) and those with moderate or
severe acute pancreatitis (mean, 54.8 years
[range, 43­82]; P ¼ 0.007). No statistically
significant between-group differences were
observed in terms of BMI (data not shown)
or in biliary factors. In patients with severe
pancreatitis, there were three deaths caused
by systemic inflammatory response syn-
drome and multiorgan deficiency. There
were no statistically significant between-
group differences in terms of sex, aetiology,
or lipase, albumin, creatinine and WBC
values on admission, however, admission

significantly different (P < 0.001, P ¼ 0.001,
and P ¼ 0.029 respectively). Strongly signifi-
cant between-group differences were also
found in terms of resistin levels (day 1 [24 h],
day 3 and day 7) and CRP levels (day 1
[24 h], day 3 and day 7; Table 1), with lower
levels in the mild acute pancreatitis groups
versus moderate/severe acute pancreatitis
group. Duration of hospital stay was
significantly lower in the mild acute pan-
creatitis patient group (8.5 Æ 4.4 days) com-
pared with the moderate/severe patient
group (16.3 Æ 7.7 days, P < 0.001). A signifi-
cant between-group difference was also
found in terms of Balthazar score and CT
severity index (1[0­4] versus 3.6 [3­4],
P < 0.001 and 0.9 [0­4] versus 5.6 [3­10],
P < 0.001, respectively).

A strong correlation was observed
between resistin and CRP, and resistin and
WBC in the first 24 h, day 3 and day 7
(Table 2). In patients with mild acute pan-
creatitis, resistin levels remained relatively
stable during the 7-day study period,
whereas in the moderate or severe acute
pancreatitis group, resistin levels gradually
increased.
The ROC analysis (applied to predict
cases of severe acute pancreatitis) showed
that the predictive value was significantly
higher for resistin levels than for CRP and
WBC levels on day 3 (AUC, 0.88, 0.81 and
0.63, respectively; Figure 1). Resistin levels
on day 3 were also revealed to be signifi-
cantly better than CRP levels in predicting
necrosis development (AUC, 0.70 and 0.69,
respectively; Figure 2). The cut-off value was
determined to be 19.5 ng/ml (93% sensitiv-
ity, 70% specificity) for severe pancreatitis
Discussion
Acute pancreatitis is a frequently seen dis-
ease with a wide clinical spectrum ranging
from mild to severe. Most acute pancreatitis
progresses mildly and is self-limiting, how-
ever, 10­20% of the cases progress severely
and 29­43% of severe cases progress
fatally.2,3,18,19 Mortality rates associated
with systemic inflammatory responses in
the earlier periods of severe pancreatitis
have decreased, but the death rate due to
infected necrosis and septic complications in
the latter period remains relatively high.2
C-reactive protein is an easily detectable
marker that is frequently used to predict the
clinical severity of acute pancreatitis, necro-
sis and mortality. CRP is able to differenti-
ate between mild and severe acute
pancreatitis with high precision, and to
predict the development of severe acute
pancreatitis even at 24 h following hospital
admission.20­22 However, very few studies
have examined the power of CRP for pre-
dicting pancreatic necrosis.23 Patients with
CRP levels > 150 mg/l on admission to the
emergency unit and on transfer to the
intensive care unit have been shown to
have significantly and independently worse
outcomes that those with lower CRP
levels.24 Although there is a 24­48-h latency
period before CRP levels increase, which
limits its utility as an early predictor of
severity, CRP remains a useful predictor
when levels have risen.20,23,24
The main problem in managing acute
pancreatitis is the lack of availability of
convenient indicators or scoring systems for
predicting severity and necrosis in the first
hours of the disease, although many indica-
tors have been researched in this
regard.1,4­8,19­24 The adipokine family,
which contains adiponectin, leptin, resistin
and visfatin, may help to resolve this

problem. Resistin and visfatin are hormones
that are synthesized in neutrophils, macro-
phages, bone marrow, and fat tissue and can
increase proinflammatory cytokine
release.16,25,26
Adipose tissue is thought to be part of the
endocrine system, and to play a role in the
pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
Peripancreatic adipose tissue necrosis can
lead to intense cytokine release (interleukin
[IL]-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-a) and
adipokines can play a role in multiorgan
failure and systemic changes.27,28 The early
increase in adipocyte-induced indicators can
be an important predictor of the clinical
progress of acute pancreatitis.29 Obesity is
considered an independent risk factor for
the development of severe acute
pancreatitis.30,31 Resistin may be a causative
factor of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia,
due to its association with insulin
resistance.13,30
A relationship between acute pancreatitis
and adipokines was shown by a study
reporting significantly higher serum leptin
levels in patients with acute pancreatitis and
an animal model of acute pancreatitis,
compared with control groups.32 A study
that investigated resistin levels in the pan-
creatic tissue of rats with acute pancreatitis
revealed a correlation between the resistin
level and disease-related tissue damage,30
and also showed that the CRP level was
associated with disease severity.30 Another
study revealed that resistin levels were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with acute

pancreatitis compared with heathy con-
trols.33 Prompted by these published studies,
the present study further investigated the
relationship between resistin levels and the
severity of acute pancreatitis.
In one study,34 significantly elevated
admission resistin levels was shown in
patients with higher pancreatic and extra-
pancreatic necrosis scores, and a resistin cut-
off value of 11.9 ng/ml was found in the
presence of peripancreatic necrosis. These
results34 suggest that there is a significant
correlation between resistin levels and sever-
ity of disease, intervention requirements,
morbidity and mortality; such findings con-
curred with another acute pancreatitis
study,35 in which resistin levels were signifi-
cantly higher at hospital admission, and on
day 3 following admission, compared with
controls. Resistin levels were increased on
day 5 compared with day 3, and a significant
correlation was found between the CRP and
resistin levels.35
In the present study, resistin levels were
significantly different between patients with
mild acute pancreatitis and those with mod-
erate or severe acute pancreatitis at admis-
sion and on days 1, 3 and 7 following
admission. Likewise, in patients with mild
acute pancreatitis, resistin levels remained
relatively stable during the 7-day study
period, whereas in the moderate/severe
acute pancreatitis group, resistin levels grad-
ually increased. The present study revealed
that day 3 resistin levels provided improved
prediction for severe pancreatitis compared

with CRP and WBC values measured on day
3. In addition, day 3 resistin levels provided
a better prediction of necrosis development
compared with day 3 CRP levels. Published
studies have shown that day 3 resistin levels
were similar to CRP in predicting severe
pancreatitis, in contrast to previous predic-
tions of necrosis.34,35 One reason for this
difference may be due to the large number of
patients with severe pancreatitis in the pre-
viously published studies compared with the
present study. In the present study, the cut-
off value was determined to be 19.5 ng/ml
(93% sensitivity, 70% specificity) for severe
pancreatitis.
Increases in adipose tissue due to obesity
increases the complexity of acute pancrea-
titis, for example, obesity can lead to an
increase in local complications, organ failure
and mortality risk.36 Fat necrosis cannot be
assessed with CT because fat tissue does not
hold contrast. Therefore, there is a clear
need for methods other than CT that are
more effective, usable, economical, and have
very few side-effects, for the early determin-
ation of peripancreatic fat necrosis in par-
ticular. Resistin may be a useful marker as
an indirect indicator of adipose tissue necro-
sis and predictor for the severity of acute
pancreatitis. However, the present study is
limited by the relatively small sample size
and further randomized, controlled studies
that include a larger patient group are
required to validate these results.
In conclusion, resistin may represent a
new, inexpensive and effective indicator for
predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis
and presence of necrosis, and thus the
hospitalization period, disease management,
and early endoscopic, percutaneous or sur-
gical intervention requirements in patients
with acute pancreatitis.
