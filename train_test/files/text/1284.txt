Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a
diverse group of chemicals emitted as gases
from a variety of commonly used products.
The general population is exposed to VOCs
from cleaning and degreasing agents, pesti-
cides, air fresheners, toilet bowl deodorants,
furniture, tobacco smoke, and building mate-
rials such as pressed wood products, adhesives,
carpeting, paints, and varnishes. Although
VOCs are also released into the outdoor air
through automotive exhaust and industrial
emissions, indoor VOC concentrations are
much higher (Wallace et al. 1987, 1991).
Because people spend most of their time
indoors, health effects related to VOCs in the
residential setting are a concern, particularly
with respect to respiratory illness (Diez et al.
2000; Farrow et al. 2003; Fiedler et al. 2005;
Harving et al. 1991; Koren et al. 1992;
Norback et al. 1995; Pappas et al. 2000;
Smedje et al. 1997; Venn et al. 2003;
Wieslander et al. 1997). Several studies have
shown that elevated air concentrations of
VOCs are associated with respiratory symp-
toms (Diez et al. 2000; Norback et al. 1995;
Pappas et al. 2000; Rumchev et al. 2005;
Smedje et al. 1997; Wieslander et al. 1997).
Studies of VOC exposures and measures of
pulmonary function have mostly been small
and have used short-term measurements of
VOC air concentrations in a single location to
characterize exposures, which may not reflect
the chronic exposures to these compounds
(Fiedler et al. 2005; Harving et al. 1991;
Norback et al. 1995; Pappas et al. 2000;
Wieslander et al. 1997). Blood concentrations
may better reflect chronic exposures to VOCs
because they integrate exposures from all
sources and can be used to estimate internal
dose (Ashley and Prah 1997; Ashley et al.
1994; Sexton et al. 2005a).
A variety of VOCs were measured in a
subset of participants in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988­1994) (NHANES III) to determine
background exposure levels for adults in the
general U.S. population (Ashley et al. 1994).
Because there is a paucity of information about
chronic VOC exposure and pulmonary func-
tion, we examined VOC blood concentrations
in relation to pulmonary function using data
from NHANES III (Ashley et al. 1994).
Materials and Methods
Study population. We used data from
NHANES III and its component Priority
Toxicant Reference Range Study, designed to
assess the levels of common pesticides and
VOCs in a representative sample of the U.S.
adult population. The studies were conducted
from 1988 through 1994. Detailed informa-
tion about NHANES III and the Priority
Toxicant Reference Range Study may be
found elsewhere [National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) 1996, 2000]. Briefly,
NHANES III is the seventh in a series of peri-
odic surveys conducted by the NCHS of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
designed to provide national estimates of the
health and nutritional status of noninstitution-
alized U.S. civilians  2 months of age. The
Priority Toxicant Reference Range Study
included a sample of 1,338 men and women
from NHANES III, 20­59 years of age,
selected on the basis of age, race, sex, and
region of residence. Among these 1,338 par-
ticipants, 1,018 provided an additional blood
sample for measurement of VOCs and
completed a questionnaire about exposure to
various chemical products.
Pulmonary function. In NHANES III,
spirometry was conducted according to the
1987 American Thoracic Society recommen-
dations (NCHS 2001). The National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
served as the quality control center for the
results. Technicians received formal training
and satisfactorily completed an NIOSH-
approved course on spirometry.
Our analyses included forced expiratory
volume at 1 sec (FEV1
; milliliters), forced vital
capacity (FVC; milliliters), peak expiratory
flow rate (PEFR; milliliters per second), and
maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMEFR;
milliliters per second). We adjusted all models
for race/ethnicity group (indicator variables
for African American, Mexican American, and
other), age (continuous), age squared (contin-
uous), standing height (continuous), body
mass index (continuous), and sex, to account
for differences in pulmonary function based
on these characteristics.
We included participants in analyses if
they had at least two successful pulmonary
function maneuvers and if their results were

BACKGROUND: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are present in much higher concentrations
indoors, where people spend most of their time, than outdoors and may have adverse health effects.
VOCs have been associated with respiratory symptoms, but few studies address objective respira-
tory end points such as pulmonary function. Blood levels of VOCs may be more indicative of per-
sonal exposures than are air concentrations; no studies have addressed their relationship with
respiratory outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether concentrations of 11 VOCs that were commonly identified in
blood from a sample of the U.S. population were associated with pulmonary function.
METHODS: We used data from 953 adult participants (20­59 years of age) in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) who had VOC blood measures as well as
pulmonary function measures. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship
between 11 VOCs and measures of pulmonary function.
RESULTS: After adjustment for smoking, only 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) was associated with
reduced pulmonary function. Participants in the highest decile of 1,4-DCB concentration had
decrements of ­153 mL [95% confidence interval (CI), ­297 to ­8] in forced expiratory volume in
1 sec and ­346 mL/sec (95% CI, ­667 to ­24) in maximum mid-expiratory flow rate, compared
with participants in the lowest decile.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to 1,4-DCB, a VOC related to the use of air fresheners, toilet bowl deodor-
ants, and mothballs, at levels found in the U.S. general population, may result in reduced pulmonary
function. This common exposure may have long-term adverse effects on respiratory health.

coded as reliable and reproducible. A reliable
maneuver was a maximal exhalation without
cough, excessive hesitation, leak, obstructed
mouthpiece, variable effort, or early termina-
tion (NCHS 1996). Reproducible maneuvers
were recorded for FVC and FEV1
and were
defined as the largest FVC and second largest
FVC within 5%, and the largest FEV1
and
second largest FEV1
within 5%. Of 1,018
participants with VOC measures, 953 met
our pulmonary function inclusion criteria.
VOCs. In the Priority Toxicant Reference
Range Study, 32 VOCs were measured in
blood, using purge and trap gas chromatogra-
phy/mass spectrometry as previously described
(Ashley et al. 1992, 1994). We analyzed the 11
VOCs with median values above the limit of
detection [1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCE),
1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB), 2-butanone,
acetone, benzene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene,
o-xylene, styrene, tetrachloroethene, toluene].
Of the 953 participants who had a value for at
least 1 of 11 VOCs and who had acceptable
pulmonary function data, sample sizes varied
across VOCs (range, 513­953), because results
for some VOCs were not available for all par-
ticipants (NCHS 2001). Although the reasons
for different sample sizes are not given in the
NHANES III documentation, it is possible
that some blood samples failed to meet accept-
ability standards or were invalid due to clot-
ting, or that the laboratory experienced
problems with instruments or quality control
parameters (Sexton et al. 2005a).
Statistical analyses. We used ordinary
least-squares regression models to evaluate the
association between each VOC and each pul-
monary function outcome. For samples with
VOC measures below the limit of detection, a
value equal to the detection limit divided by
the square root of 2 was assigned (NCHS
2000). We used natural log transformations of
VOC concentrations to reduce the influence
of their skewed distributions on the regression
model estimates. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests to compare VOC median values between
two groups and Kruskal-Wallis tests to com-
pare values among three or more groups. We
performed tests for linear trends across deciles
using one-way analysis of variance. We con-
ducted all analyses using SAS (version 9.0;
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Weighting is
not recommended for analysis of data from
the Priority Toxicant Reference Range Study
(NCHS 2000).
For descriptive purposes, we first analyzed
VOCs in relation to pulmonary function with-
out adjustment for smoking. However, because
smoking and environmental tobacco smoke are
sources of VOCs and also affect pulmonary
function, we then added terms for smoking
status (current, quit within the previous 12
months, quit more than 12 months previously,
never), number of cigarettes smoked per day
(continuous), years smoked (continuous), and
serum cotinine level (continuous). Smoking
was a confounder for most VOCs.
We then used a change-in-estimate
method to evaluate additional variables as con-
founders for the VOCs still related to pul-
monary function after adjustment for smoking
(Greenland 1989). Our cutoff criterion was a
10% change in the VOC -coefficient in rela-
tion to pulmonary function. In this manner,
we assessed the following potential con-
founders: socioeconomic status (education,
poverty:income ratio, use of food stamps
within the previous 12 months), self-reported
doctor diagnosis of emphysema, use of fireplace
within the previous 12 months or wood or gas
stove for heating or cooking, age of the house
(construction year before 1946, 1946­1973,
1974 to present), presence of furred pets at
home, and occupational exposure. Occupational
exposure (yes, no) was indicated by a variable
denoting occupations associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in this
population (Hnizdo et al. 2002). The only fac-
tor that met the criterion for confounding was
self-reported doctor diagnosis of emphysema,
and this was included in the final models. We
repeated analyses excluding people with self-
reported doctor diagnosis of asthma, and the
results were not changed appreciably.
Results
Characteristics of the study population are

detection. As expected, acetone was present in
much higher concentrations than other
VOCs because it is produced endogenously.
Men had significantly higher measured values
for most VOCs (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests,
p < 0.05), except for 1,1,1-TCE, 1,4-DCB,
and tetrachloroethene (TCE). As has been
reported previously for this population
(Churchill et al. 2001), Mexican Americans
had lower concentrations of benzene, ethyl-
benzene, styrene, TCE, and toluene and sig-
nificantly higher levels of m,p-xylene than did
other ethnic groups. For 1,4-DCB, non-
Hispanic whites had the lowest and African
Americans the highest concentrations.
In the models unadjusted for smoking,
reductions in at least one pulmonary function
outcome were statistically significant for
1,4-DCB, benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, and
toluene (data not shown). However, when
these models were adjusted for smoking vari-
ables, only 1,4-DCB remained statistically sig-
nificantly associated with reduced pulmonary
function. For example, after adjustment for
smoking, VOC -coefficients for FEV1
changed
from ­72 mL (p < 0.0001) to ­1 mL (p = 0.95)
for benzene, from ­51 mL (p = 0.03) to 15 mL
(p = 0.57) for ethylbenzene, from ­61 mL (p =
0.01) to 42 mL (p = 0.19) for styrene, and from
­69 mL (p < 0.01) to 16 mL (p = 0.60) for
toluene, whereas the -coefficient for 1,4-DCB
remained unchanged (­24 mL, p = 0.04).
Because only 1,4-DCB maintained its
association with pulmonary function in the
presence of smoking, further analyses were
limited to this VOC. The exposure distribu-
tion of 1,4-DCB differed by race/ethnicity
group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.0001), with
African Americans having the highest expo-
sures (Table 3).
Among all participants, 1,4-DCB was
inversely related to all four pulmonary function
measures but was statistically significant only
for FEV1
and MMEFR (Table 4). Power is
limited for sex-specific analyses; however,
higher 1,4-DCB was related to lower levels of
each pulmonary function measure in both men
and women. Likewise, 1,4-DCB was inversely
associated with all four measures within each of
the race groupings, although numbers become
unstable. Numbers are further reduced within
the six race/sex groups, but 1,4-DCB was
inversely related to at least one of the four pul-
monary function measures in each of the six
subgroups. The results were strongest and sta-
tistically significant for non-Hispanic white
females (FEV1
,  = ­266, p = 0.02) and
African-American males (FEV1
,  = ­282, p =
0.01), although we did not find significant evi-
dence of effect modification by race/sex combi-
nations (multiple partial F-test, p > 0.10 for all
pulmonary function outcomes).
Higher levels of 1,4-DCB were related to
reduced pulmonary function in never-smokers
as well as smokers (Table 4). Results for
never-smokers were similar when we defined
nonsmokers in a more stringent manner as
having serum cotinine < 0.62 ng/mL, the
75th percentile among nonsmokers (n = 299;
data not shown).
To further examine the relationship
between 1,4-DCB and pulmonary function,
we conducted additional analyses using uri-
nary concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol
(2,5-DCP), the major metabolite of 1,4-DCB
(Hissink et al. 1997). 2,5-DCP was one of 12
pesticide metabolites measured in the urine of
NHANES III participants, using capillary gas
chromatography and tandem mass spectrome-
try (Hill et al. 1995b). Although 2,5-DCP
measurements were available only on 534 of the
846 subjects included in the analysis of 1,4-
DCB, the -coefficients for both compounds
were inversely related to all pulmonary function
measures, and the result for FEV1
was more sta-
tistically precise. For example, the expected
change in FEV1
with each increase in exposure
from the 10th to 90th percentile (3.76 µg/L
for 1,4-DCB and 4.67 µg/L for 2,5-DCP) was
­96 mL (p = 0.03) for 1,4-DCB and ­134 mL
(p = 0.02) for 2,5-DCP.
To facilitate interpretation of the associa-
tion between 1,4-DCB and pulmonary func-
tion that we observed in these data using
logarithmic transformation, we categorized
nontransformed values of 1,4-DCB into
deciles. Figure 1 shows the changes in FEV1
(milliliters) and MMEFR (milliliters per sec-
ond) for each decile of 1,4-DCB exposure,
compared with participants in the lowest
decile. Tests for linear trend across deciles
were statistically significant (FEV1
, p = 0.02;
MMEFR, p = 0.02). Subjects in the highest
decile of exposure had FEV1
decrements of
­153 mL [95% confidence interval (CI),
­297 to ­8] and MMEFR decrements of
­346 mL/sec (95% CI, ­667 to ­24), com-
pared with participants in the lowest decile.
Discussion
We examined the relationship between blood
concentrations of 11 VOCs with median val-
ues above the limit of detection and pul-
monary function outcomes in participants of
NHANES III and found that 1,4-DCB was
the only VOC associated with reduced pul-
monary function after adjustment for smoking.
Participants in the highest decile of 1,4-DCB
concentration had FEV1
and MMEFR decre-
ments of ­153 mL (95% CI, ­297 to ­8) and

tively, compared with participants in the low-
est decile. This compares with a 100-mL
deficit in FEV1
for the highest tertile of serum
cotinine in nonsmoking females in the
NHANES III population (Eisner 2002).
Because we conducted separate analyses
for 11 different VOCs, it is possible that the
statistical significance of the inverse associa-
tion between 1,4-DCB and pulmonary func-
tion occurred by chance. However, this seems
unlikely given the consistent results across
subgroup analyses. Furthermore, an analysis
of pulmonary function and 2,5-DCP, the uri-
nary metabolite of 1,4-DCB, resulted in simi-
lar associations, with the result for FEV1
reaching statistical significance, despite the
smaller sample size.
It is possible that 1,4-DCB blood concen-
trations may reflect exposure better than do
blood concentrations of other VOCs, because
air and blood concentrations are better corre-
lated for 1,4-DCB (Sexton et al. 2005a). In
the School Health Initiative: Environment,
Learning, Disease (SHIELD) study, 2-day
integrated personal air samples of indoor
VOCs were taken immediately before taking
VOC blood measurements from 143 children
in Minneapolis (Sexton et al. 2005a).
Personal air samples and VOC blood mea-
surements were taken four times over 2 years.
Among the VOCs measured, only 1,4-DCB
had a high correlation between air and blood
concentrations (R2 = 0.79). Except for ace-
tone and 2-butanone, that study measured
the same VOCs we included in our analyses.
Although VOCs generally do not persist in
the blood after termination of acute exposure
(Ashley and Prah 1997), after frequent pro-
longed exposures, blood concentrations can
reflect chronic exposures (Ashley and Prah
1997; Ashley et al. 1994; Sexton et al. 2005a,
2005b). For example, examination of the
uptake and elimination of some VOCs has sug-
gested that bioaccumulation may occur in mul-
tiple storage sites in the human body (Ashley
and Prah 1997). In the SHIELD study, the
between-child variability of 1,4-DCB blood
concentrations greatly exceeded the within-
child variability (ratio = 434), suggesting that
one blood measurement of 1,4-DCB is a good
indication of an individual's blood concentra-
tion over time. In contrast, other VOCs had
much lower ratios of between- and within-child
variability; for example, the next highest were
for TCE (ratio = 2), ethylbenzene (ratio ~ 1),
and 1,1,1-TCE (ratio ~ 1). The high ratio
of between- to within-child variability for
1,4-DCB was not seen in the younger children
of the Developmental Research on Attention
and Memory Skills (DREAMS) study, but far
fewer children had more than one blood sample
to estimate the ratio of within- to between-child
variability (e.g., 126 in the SHIELD study
compared with 22 in the DREAMS study)
(Sexton et al. 2005b).
Apart from the findings in the SHIELD
study (Sexton et al. 2005a), little is known
about the relationship between personal
1,4-DCB exposures and blood concentrations.
Based on data from a graph of this relationship
in children (Sexton et al. 2005a), we estimate
that a 1,4-DCB blood concentration of 10
µg/L may correspond to personal exposures of
102 µg/m3 or greater, which is close to the pro-
posed chronic duration minimal risk limit
(120 µg/m3) [Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) 2004]. Blood levels
of 1,4-DCB were higher in children from the
SHIELD study than in the NHANES III
adults we studied. For example, the 95th per-
centile was 11.03 µg/L for NHANES III and
27.00 µg/L for the SHIELD study. If 1,4-
DCB air concentrations can be extrapolated
from blood concentrations, it is possible that
the highest blood concentrations of 1,4-DCB
in NHANES III represent exposures to air
concentrations greater than the proposed
chronic duration minimal risk limit.
People who use air fresheners, toilet bowl
deodorants, and mothballs have potential for
high exposure to 1,4-DCB because it is an
important component of these products
(ATSDR 2004; Churchill et al. 2001).
However, exposure also occurs in the absence
of these products as the compound is com-
mon in indoor environments. For example,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
Total Exposure Assessment Methodology
(TEAM) study in 1987 found 1,4-DCB in the
air of 80% of the homes surveyed (Wallace
et al. 1987), although only one-third of the
homes used products containing 1,4-DCB
(Wallace 1991). The finding that 96% of the
NHANES III subset had detectable 1,4-DCB
blood concentrations (Hill et al. 1995a) is fur-
ther evidence that exposure is common
(Sampson et al. 1994).
Although 1,4-DCB is common in indoor
environments, little is known about its effects
on human health. Hepatic, dermatologic, and
respiratory effects have been reported with
acute exposures, but these case reports lack clear
information about exposure levels (ATSDR
2004; National Institutes of Health 2005).
Data from a single occupational study of 58
men (Hollingsworth et al. 1956) were used in
conjunction with animal studies to derive acute
and chronic exposure levels in the air consid-
ered to pose the minimal risk to humans
(ATSDR 2004). Because these limits are
derived mostly from animal studies, uncertainty
factors are used for extrapolation to humans.
The minimal risk limits for human exposure to
1,4-DCB are 2 ppm (12 mg/m3) for acute
duration ( 24 hr), 0.1 ppm (0.6 mg/m3) for
intermediate duration (> 14 days but < 1 year),
and 0.02 ppm (0.12 mg/m3) for chronic dura-
tion (up to a lifetime) (ATSDR 2004).
Among the studies that have measured
1,4-DCB air or blood concentrations (Delfino
et al. 2003; Hollingsworth et al. 1956;
Rumchev et al. 2005; Sexton et al. 2005a,
2005b; Wallace et al. 1987, 1991), only three
measured health outcomes (Delfino et al.
2003; Hollingsworth et al. 1956; Rumchev
et al. 2005). Of these, only two measured res-
piratory outcomes and included only children.
In one study, children 6 months to 3 years of
age (n = 88) had higher odds of asthma with
increasing indoor air concentrations of
1,4-DCB (Rumchev et al. 2005). In a panel
study of 22 asthmatic children 10­16 years of
age, respiratory symptoms were associated
with outdoor air concentrations of total VOCs
but not with 1,4-DCB alone (Delfino et al.
2003). Children in this study measured morn-
ing and evening peak flow; no relationship
with any VOC was observed. No other pul-
monary measures were tested. As expected,
outdoor air concentrations of 1,4-DCB were
low (0.3­3.0 µg/m3).
Indoor air concentrations of 1,4-DCB are
significantly greater than outdoor air concen-
trations (Wallace et al. 1987). For example,
the TEAM study measured mean personal
exposures of 21 µg/m3 and indoor concentra-
tions of 30 µg/m3, compared with outdoor
concentrations of 2.0 µg/m3 (Wallace et al.
1987). According to other measures, levels in
some homes and public restrooms may reach
almost 1.64 mg/m3 (ATSDR 2004), which
is greater than the minimal risk limit for
chronic exposure.
The chronic duration minimal risk limit is
based on observed eosinophilic changes in the
olfactory epithelium of rats; no information was
available on effects of exposure on pulmonary
VOCs and pulmonary function in NHANES III

function (ATSDR 2004). Although reductions
in pulmonary function can be transient and do
not necessarily reflect permanent adverse health
effects (ATS 2000), they generally precede per-
manent effects. Thus, chronic reduction in
FEV1
is a sentinel event for adverse health
effects from inhaled exposures, such as air pol-
lution (ATS 2000). In particular, FEV1
has
been identified as a risk factor in cardiovascular
disease, stroke, and lung cancer, as well as an
important predictor of all-cause mortality (Hole
et al. 1996).
It is probable that most exposures to
1,4-DCB are chronic, rather than acute and
sporadic, because 1,4-DCB is a component of
household products used for prolonged peri-
ods. For example, air fresheners, toilet bowl
deodorants, and mothballs are used until their
emissions cease, and then they are replaced.
Staff interviewers in the SHIELD study,
where blood concentrations of 1,4-DCB were
high, noted that many children's homes had
pervasive scents of air fresheners (Sexton et al.
2005a). In NHANES III, 32.1% of the par-
ticipants in the VOC study reported recent
use of air fresheners or room deodorizers.
Fewer participants reported recent use of toi-
let bowl deodorants (8.7%), although their
use was associated with a 2-fold increase in
odds of having high 1,4-DCB blood levels
(Churchill et al. 2001).
Because NHANES III is a cross-sectional
study, measurements of exposure and out-
come were made at the same time, and it is
not possible to determine if 1,4-DCB expo-
sure preceded pulmonary function decline. A
longitudinal study measuring pulmonary
function and exposure to 1,4-DCB at various
time points would be necessary to evaluate
the temporality of this relationship. Although
it is possible that people who are exposed to
toilet bowl or air fresheners and other room
deodorizers might also be exposed to cleaning
products that impair pulmonary function, we
had no data to address this.
The inverse association between 1,4-DCB
concentration and pulmonary function may
have been affected by unmeasured con-
founders. We assessed the influence of other
factors that may be related to pulmonary
function and to 1,4-DCB exposure, such as
type of heating, use of wood fires, age of
house, presence of furred pets, occupation,
socioeconomic status, presence of environ-
mental tobacco smoke, smoking history, and
diagnosis of asthma or emphysema. Only
emphysema confounded the relationship
between 1,4-DCB and pulmonary function
deficits. The ability to carefully adjust for
smoking with several variables, including the
objective measure of environmental tobacco
smoke exposure, serum cotinine, was a con-
siderable strength of our analyses.
The size and diversity of this NHANES
III sample make it possible to examine the
relationships between VOCs and pulmonary
function in more detail than has been possible
in smaller studies. Our findings suggest that
1,4-DCB exposure at levels found in the U.S.
general population may result in decreases
in pulmonary function. Larger and longitudi-
nal studies would be necessary to properly
evaluate the effects on respiratory symptoms
and disease.
