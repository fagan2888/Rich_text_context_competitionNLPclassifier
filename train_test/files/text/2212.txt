behaviors screening in a clinical setting: a case study
on adolescent hazardous alcohol use

ABSTRACT
Underage alcohol use is the leading cause of preventable
mortality among adolescents in the USA. Moreover, the
average age of onset of underage drinking is 13 years.
This study examined the feasibility of using a text
messaging survey (TMS) to assess adolescent alcohol
use. A sample of 29 adolescents, aged 13e17 years,
was recruited from two primary care clinics. They
completed a 16 question TMS while in the waiting room
and a two-question exit TMS. The participation rate was
87%. Two out of 25 (8%) adolescents met the criteria for
hazardous drinking and 28% reported alcohol use. It was
found that 38% and 25% of adolescents who completed
the exit TMS were asked or advised about drinking,
respectively. Text messaging to assess adolescent
alcohol use in this setting seems feasible, does not
disrupt patient workflow, and can assess many health
behaviors before a clinical encounter.
INTRODUCTION
Underage alcohol use is the leading cause of
preventable mortality among adolescents in the
USA.1 Alcohol use often starts during early
adolescence; the average age of onset for alcohol use
among adolescents in the USA is 13.2 years.2
Furthermore, motor vehicle injuries are the leading
cause of death for 15e20-year-olds and 25% of
those deaths involved an alcohol-impaired driver.3
Recognizing and assessing underage alcohol use
is a key component in preventing and reducing
teenage morbidity and mortality. Since most
adolescents have health insurance, either public or
private, and receive at least one medical check-up
annually,4 5 primary care physicians (PCPs) are in
a unique position to have an effect on teenage
alcohol use by providing early identification,
assessment, intervention, and referrals. The Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics and the American
Medical Association recommend adolescent alcohol
screening, identification, advice, and discussion at
every visit.6e8 Despite these guidelines, several
studies have found that PCP compliance with
American Academy of Pediatric/American Medical
Association guidelines ranges from 23% to 45%.8e10
The most common reason cited by healthcare
professionals for not discussing sensitive topics
such as adolescent substance abuse is time.11e13
Identification of health problems before the clinical
encounter can guide PCPs in dealing with specific
health concerns making the clinical encounter more
efficient and possibly even shorter. Only 35% of
adolescents reported discussing substance use with
their PCP, although 65% said that they wanted to
do so.14 When given a computerized option for
substance use screening, adolescents preferred it to
verbal inquiry from a nurse or physician, and did
not differ in what they were likely to reveal.15
Confidentiality is another concern for adolescents.
Over half (58%) of high school students have
health concerns that they wished to keep private
from their parents and from friends and classmates
(69%); similarly, 25% reported that they would
forego healthcare in some situations if their parents
might find out.16
Wireless technology has been used to address
PCP and adolescent concerns. Personal digital
assistants (PDAs) have been used in clinics to
enhance adolescent screening and counseling in
primary care. A recent study in five primary care
practices in the USA found that a PDA-based
screening tool enhances physician counseling and
improves adolescents' perceptions of the well
visit.17 Another study examining the use of PDAs
on alcohol screening reported that with PDA usage
more adolescents rated their visit as confidential,
more thought they were listened to carefully,
and more were very satisfied (all statistically
significant differences).18 However, PDAs are
expensive, learning to use them requires training
and thus uses valuable time in a clinic, and demand
a support staff to solve technical problems.
Cell phone texting provides an innovative tech-
nological approach to deal with this important
public health problem. Its widespread use and fast
adoption have created innovative ways for patients
and healthcare providers to interact about a variety
of healthcare problems.16 Moreover, mobile phones
are an effective mode to deliver information owing
to familiarity, ubiquity, and affordability.18 Texting
may also provide a method of interaction that is,
simple, confidential, and preferable to adolescents.
Research shows that most adolescents own a cell
phone and that texting is their preferred means of
communication19 20; 50% of children aged 8e12
and 75% of 17-year-olds own mobile phones.19
Minimal research has been done on the feasibility
of using text messaging technology in a clinic.
It is impossible to predict the future of wireless
technologies. However, a 2011 report found that
35% of adults in the USA own a smartphone.21
Furthermore, by the end of 2011 smartphones will
be owned by 50% of cell phone users.22 Clearly, the
trend seems to be the acquisition of more powerful
mobile devices. These devices will allow owners
short messages service (SMS) capabilities and also
internet connection. Once this transition occurs,

more diverse and interactive types of surveys and interventions
can be developed and tested.
The aim of this paper is to examine the feasibility of using
text messaging survey (TMS) technology to assess adolescent
alcohol use in a clinic. We use alcohol screening in primary care
as a case example.
METHODS
Participants and setting
Participants were recruited while attending a pediatric or
a family medicine clinic. Eligibility criteria included being
13e17 years old, having a cell phone with text message capa-
bilities, and being mentally and physically able to send and
receive text messages. Parental and adolescent consent were
obtained before any assessment.
Procedures
A research assistant (RA) approached consecutive adolescents
and their parents as they arrived for their clinical appointments.
The RA explained the purpose of the study and determined
eligibility. Thereafter, adolescents were given a printed card with
a text number and survey initiation code and instructions on
how to access the survey. Adolescents were instructed to return
to the RA after their scheduled appointment to receive
instructions on accessing a separate two-question exit survey
and to receive a $25 debit card to cover any text message charges
and as a token of appreciation for participating.
Materials
This pilot study employed a low-cost system using mobile
phones to receive and send SMS survey questions. The appli-
cation uses text-to-email conversion capabilities from USA
mobile phone companies, allowing teens to use their personal
phones. This feature is key to ensure adoption and use as it
prevents patient workflow disruptions that would occur if teens
had to learn how to text on a new phone, be trained to use
a PDA or create a username and password to login to a website.
An RA gave participants a printed card with a text number
and survey initiation code and instructions on how to access the
survey. As soon as adolescents send a text message with the
survey initiation code to a study-specific number the automated
texting system sends the first questions to cell phones and waits
for a response. After each response, the system sends the next
question until the last question is reached. This concludes the
first stage of the TMS. After the medical assessment, an RA
instructs participants to text a different survey initiation code to
the same number. The automated system sends the exit ques-
tions to cell phones following the same protocol described above.
Only two questions are sent and that concludes the TMS.
Adolescent responses are stored as a spreadsheet data file where
each row and column corresponds to a participant and TMS
question, respectively. The participants' phone numbers are then
automatically deleted, the file saved, and delivered to the
researcher. Once the researcher receives the spreadsheet data file
it is converted to Stata version 1123 format (Stata, College
Station, Texas, USA). Statistical analyses and reports were also
generated using Stata.23
The TMS consisted of 18 questions that were divided in two
parts (see the online supplementary appendix). The first part
included 16 questions and the second part consisted of two
questions sent soon after the adolescent left the clinical
encounter. The TMS gathers information about demographics,
diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, and PCP's assessment
and advice on alcohol use. The CRAFFT instrument was used to
assess alcohol use. CRAFFT is a mnemonic based on key words
within the individual questions: "Have you ever ridden in a CAR
driven by someone (including yourself) who had been using
alcohol?" "Do you ever use alcohol to RELAX, feel better about
yourself, or fit in?" "Do you ever use alcohol while you are by
yourself or ALONE?" "Do you ever FORGET things that you
did while using alcohol?" "Do your family or FRIENDS ever tell
you that you should cut down on your drinking?" "Have you
ever gotten into TROUBLE while you were using alcohol?" Two
or more "yes" answers suggest that the respondent may have
a serious problem with alcohol abuse and an additional assess-
ment is warranted. CRAFFT has been validated and tested on
adolescents in a clinic24 and is not affected by age, sex, or race.25
Analysis
Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were
calculated using Stata V.11.23
RESULTS
A total of 55 adolescents were approached to participate. Of
these, 18 were ineligible for two reasons (ie, physical or mental
disability (n¼3), or did not bring their cell phones (n¼15)).
Eligible participants comprised 37 teens but parental or partici-
pant refusals lowered the sample to 32. The study sample
included 32 adolescents ages 13e17 for a response rate of 86%.
However, three had faulty cell phones so the final sample was 29
adolescents (see figure 1).

pants.

Participants had a mean age of 14.7 years (SD61.3 years) and
were almost equally divided by sex. The average length to
complete the TMS was 15 min (SD 65 min). Table 2 presents
results for the CRAFFT questions.
For example, the most commonly reported risk behavior was
riding in a CAR driven by someone (including yourself) after
using alcohol (21%). Two adolescents met the CRAFFT criteria
for hazardous drinking but their PCPs neither asked nor advised
them on the hazards of alcohol consumption. The exit survey
was completed by 55% (16/29) of the participants. Thirty eight
per cent (6/16) of PCPs asked adolescents if they were using
alcohol while 25% (4/16) advised about the health hazards of
underage drinking.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of
using a TMS in primary care taking as a case example screening
adolescents' alcohol use. A major concern was participation rates
because both parents and adolescents had to consent. However,
this concern proved unfounded since 86% of eligible adolescents
completed the first and longest part of the TMS. This response
rate is comparable to school-based surveys26 and higher than
population-based computer-assisted interviews.2 The high
participation rate shows that using cell phone text message in
primary care is well accepted by parents and adolescents to
gather sensitive data and can facilitate screening and assessment
of unhealthy behaviors.
Another concern was possible waiting room delays, which
would compromise the use of this technology in clinics.
However, this pilot study also showed that this technology did
not increase waiting room time. Furthermore, PCPs rarely
noticed that their adolescent patients were participating in
a research study.
Security of sensitive data is also a factor that needs to be
considered. However, none of the participants expressed any
concern. Nevertheless, encryption data protocols for text
messaging authentication and confidentiality are currently
available (eg, SecureSMS) (CellTrust Corporation, Scottsdale,
Arizona, USA) and should be used when electronically collecting
and transmitting sensitive data. Security encryption protocols
must become the norm when using wireless technology for data
gathering.
This pilot study also has some limitations. The first is the
small sample typical of this kind of study. Another limitation is
the lower response rate for the exit survey. A different approach
is required to increase participation rates. Possible approaches
include sending the TMS later in the day, providing adolescents
with an additional incentive to dial and answer the TMS at
a later time, or incorporating the TMS after the PCP clinical
evaluation before leaving the examining room.
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study also has several
strengths. First, we obtained a high response rate (86%). This is
higher than similar surveys.2 26 Second, 38% of adolescents
$15 years of age reported smoking, higher than other school-
based (33%)27 or population-based surveys (29%).2 This
confirms previous findings where adolescents reported predilec-
tion for, and feeling more comfortable with, mobile technology
to answer sensitive questions about illegal and socially undesir-
able behaviors more honestly.28e30 Third, even within this small
sample, two adolescents met the CRAFFTcriteria for hazardous
alcohol use but neither of them were identified by their PCPs. Of
additional concern, is the low proportion of PCPs meeting the
recommended clinical guidelines. Fourth, the technology proved
reliable and data capturing and storage was done immediately
thus reducing data entry errors, costs, time, and quality control
needs. Finally, there were no waiting room delays and the time
needed to complete the TMS was small.
Earlier studies have shown the feasibility and usefulness of
electronic means for patients' health data.31e32 However, these
studies have some limitations (eg, cost, patient training, length
of assessment, and computer and internet literacy) and are prone
to create a social divide with respect to access and literacy. Our
study builds upon this previous work but uses a technology that
overcomes past limitations and all socioeconomic groups have
access to cell phones and know how to text.33 This study
provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of using SMS
technology to survey adolescents in a clinic before their evalu-
ation. This technology can screen adolescents for unhealthy or
hazardous behaviors before they are evaluated by their PCPs.
Information on these behaviors can be relayed to PCPs before the
visit and therefore prompt them to initiate a conversation on
identified hazardous behaviors and make more effective use of
their limited time. Moreover, SMS shortcomings on when and
where to reach participants include time zones, improper hours,
carrier coverage, international texting costs, and text messaging
charges. This technology can serve as a valuable tool to gain
a better understanding of health behaviors (eg, smoking, alcohol,
illegal drugs, and physical activity) in real life.
