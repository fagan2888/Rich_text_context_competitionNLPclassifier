Introduction
Emotional and cognitive reactions to work experiences, as
captured by measures of worker subjective well-being
(SWB; i.e. job satisfaction and job affect), evoke physio-
logical responses that, over time, lead to costly, and some-
times fatal, diseases and illnesses. In fact, job affect and job
satisfaction have been linked to various indicators of physi-
ological functioning such as blood pressure, cortisol, cho-
lesterol, and cytokines (Amati, 2010; Ilies et al., 2010;
Matthews et al., 1987; Shirom et al., 2009). Impaired
worker SWB, through its influence on physiological pro-
cesses and subsequently on individual and societal health,
produces a huge physical and financial burden for individu-
als and societies. Growing evidence that SWB influences
health and other societal outcomes has led the United
Nations to establish an International Day of Happiness
to emphasize the importance of societal SWB as a key
public policy objective (Diener and Tay, 2012; The United
Nations, 2013).
Theoretical frameworks from the positive psychology and
occupational stress traditions offer key insights about why
SWB and physiological functioning are linked. Historically,
these two traditions have employed distinct but complemen-
tary theoretical models to understand the antecedents of SWB
and physiological functioning. Occupational stress models
(e.g. the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model; Demerouti
et al., 2001) have historically emphasized the disease model
of health, highlighting the effects of negative job conditions
on strain and impaired physical and psychological health, and
positive psychology models (e.g. the Broaden-and-Build the-
ory of positive emotions; Fredrickson, 2001) have focused on
the health-enhancing role of positive emotions and positive
resources such as social support and resilience. As such, the
combination of these two traditions can generate complemen-
tary insights on the linkage between SWB and physiological
health outcomes. However, to date, no theoretical framework
has integrated the complementary perspectives from these
two traditions on the relationship between worker SWB and
physiological health outcomes. This article fills this gap by
providing a broad integrative framework on the relationship
between worker SWB and physiological outcomes, drawing

Abstract
Research shows that worker subjective well-being influences physiological functioning--an early signal of poor health
outcomes. While several theoretical perspectives provide insights on this relationship, the literature lacks an integrative
framework explaining the relationship. We develop a conceptual model explaining the link between subjective well-
being and physiological functioning in the context of work. Integrating positive psychology and occupational stress
perspectives, our model explains the relationship between subjective well-being and physiological functioning as a result
of the direct influence of subjective well-being on physiological functioning and of their common relationships with work
stress and personal resources, both of which are influenced by job conditions.

2 Health Psychology Open 
primarily from the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive
emotions and the JD-R model.
A broad framework that explains the causal link between
worker SWB and physiological outcomes is crucially impor-
tant. Growing concern about employee health has energized
a search for modifiable antecedents of the proximal pro-
cesses (i.e. physiological functioning) influencing employee
health. Highlighting the need for research on employee
health, the Center for Disease Control recently reported that
"productivity losses related to personal and family health
problems cost U.S. employers $1,685 per employee per year,
or $225.8
billion annually" (Stewart et al., 2003). These
losses manifest in a variety of forms, including absenteeism,
reduced performance, turnover-related training costs, disa-
bility losses, and high health insurance costs (Goetzel et al.,
2003, 2004; Stewart et al., 2003). Lost productivity can exert
tremendous social and financial burdens on society as a
whole. As a result, large-scale programs such as the Total
Worker Health initiative have emerged, focusing on integra-
tive approaches to improve employee health (National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2013).
Simultaneously, evidence has accumulated to show that
SWB--an important predictor of health--is modifiable
(Tay and Kuykendall, 2013) and, as such, is an ideal target
for worker health interventions. However, in order to maxi-
mize the benefit of worker health interventions targeting
SWB as a key antecedent, it is necessary to have an integra-
tive understanding of the link between SWB and the proxi-
mal antecedent of health (i.e. physiological functioning) that
draws upon and unifies complementary perspectives from
the positive psychology and occupational stress traditions.
In this article, we establish the conceptual link between
worker SWB and physiological health outcomes, focusing
specifically on the context of work. We provide a parsimo-
nious and integrative model of the link between SWB and
physiological health outcomes, proposing that the linkages
between SWB and physiological health stem not only from
the direct influence of SWB but also from common effects
of work stressors and personal resources. Our model
implies that, by focusing on common causes, interventions
can be designed to simultaneously enhance SWB and phys-
iological health.
An approach allowing for the simultaneous improve-
ment of employee SWB and health would be invaluable, as
SWB and physiological functioning are critically important
to both workers and organizations. Worker SWB is associ-
ated with a wide range of work outcomes including job per-
formance (Riketta, 2008), turnover decisions (Hom et al.,
1979), organizational citizenship behaviors (Bateman and
Organ, 1983; Farrell, 1983), and hostile behaviors toward
coworkers and supervisors (Hershcovis et al., 2007).
Furthermore, employee ill-health, as proximally caused by
poor physiological outcomes, results in increased medical
costs for organizations (Goetzel et al., 2003) and decreased
productivity (Burton et al., 1999).
Our article is structured as follows. First, we define SWB
and physiological functioning. Second, we provide a brief
background on the perspectives we draw upon to build our
theoretical model--the positive psychology perspective and
the occupational stress perspective. We then provide our
integrative framework as shown in Figure 1 and discuss each
of the mechanisms that link SWB and physiological health.

Finally, we conclude with implications of our model for
interventions simultaneously targeting worker SWB and
health. Our article contributes to the literature on worker
well-being and health by proposing an integrative model that
assimilates both the positive psychology and occupational
stress traditions to explain the linkage between worker SWB
and physiological functioning.
SWB and physiological functioning
SWB
Our conceptualization of worker SWB follows the model
commonly used in well-being studies and positive psychol-
ogy, which consists of both evaluative and affective com-
ponents (Diener, 1984, 1994). Theoretical approaches to
measure worker SWB reflect the model used in the broader
psychological sciences. In the organizational sciences,
measures of job satisfaction are typically understood to
capture primarily the cognitive aspects of SWB, whereas
measures of job affect primarily capture the affective
aspects of SWB (Kaplan et al., 2009). Multi-dimensional
measures of job satisfaction include dimensions such as
satisfaction with work, supervisor, colleagues, pay, com-
munication, and promotion (Job Descriptive Index (JDI);
Smith et al., 1969). Indices of affective well-being at work
include measures of frequent positive emotions and infre-
quent negative emotions in the work context. Popular
measures include the Positive and Negative Affective
Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988) and the Job-related
Affective Well-Being Scale (Van Katwyk et al., 2000).
Evidence that measures of job affect and job satisfaction
are related but distinct comes from recent meta-analytic
findings showing moderate correlations between measures
of worker affect and job satisfaction, ranging from an
uncorrected magnitude of .26 to .34 (Kaplan et al., 2009).
Consistent with theory and empirical findings, our
model posits that cognitive and affective components of
SWB are distinct but tightly connected because of the bi-
directional relationship between the two (see Figure 1,
Links 1 and 2). Compelling evidence for the influence of
evaluations on feelings comes from the cognitive behav-
ioral tradition, which holds that cognitive reactions to or
interpretations of events drive affective reactions and sub-
sequent behaviors. By learning to change default interpre-
tations or evaluations of events, individuals are able to
reduce undesired emotions and behaviors. The docu-
mented effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in
modifying a range of undesirable emotions (e.g. anger;
Beck and Fernandez, 1998; anxiety; Hofmann and Smits,
2008) provides support for positing a causal path from
cognitive SWB (i.e. job satisfaction) to affective SWB
(i.e. feelings).
Additionally, a strong body of evidence also supports
the assertion that feelings guide evaluations. For instance,
people tend to evaluate their life satisfaction as being higher
when they are in happier moods than when they are in sad
moods (Schwarz and Clore, 1983). Such findings are con-
sistent with the affect-as-information hypothesis (Clore,
2001), which posits that affective cues such as mood and
emotions influence judgments, "serving as experiential and
bodily information regarding how one feels about the object
of judgment" (Clore and Huntsinger, 2007). At a more
basic level, affect can also direct attentional focus to emo-
tionally congruent cues and information, thereby generat-
ing cognitive consistency with affect (Dalgleish and Watts,
1990).
Based on the evidence supporting the cognitive behavio-
ral perspective and the affect-as-information hypothesis,
our model posits that job feelings influence job evaluations
(Figure 1, Link 1) and that job evaluations influence job
feelings (Figure 1, Link 2).
Physiological functioning
Physiological functioning is commonly assessed as three
distinct but closely interrelated components: the cardiovas-
cular system, which serves to circulate the blood through
the body; the immune system, which protects the body
from disease caused by pathogens; and the endocrine sys-
tem, which regulates the function of cells and organs in the
body. These aspects of physiological functioning have been
identified as likely biological mechanisms linking psycho-
social factors to physical health (Miller et al., 2009) and
have been implicated in the development and progression
of common chronic diseases (Antoni and Lutgendorf, 2007;
Rozanski et al., 1999). As such, impairments to physiologi-
cal functioning are an easily detectable sign of underlying
processes that lead to many of the most costly health end-
points such as hypertension, heart disease, acute myocar-
dial infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(Goetzel et al., 2003).
Poorer cardiovascular functioning is usually indexed by
higher levels of blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse rate
(Krantz and Manuck, 1984; Smith and Kampine, 1990).
Endocrine functioning is indexed by different hormones
such as catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopa-
mine), cortisol, and prolactin. Higher levels of such hor-
mones are often diagnostic of poorer health. Immune
functioning is indexed by circulating concentrations of
immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and
T cells; by the functional capacities of those cells; and by
proteins produced by immune cells known as cytokines.
Generally, greater numbers of immune cells are related to
better immune response and more robust protection against
diseases (Herbert and Cohen, 1993). High levels of anti-
inflammatory cytokines and low levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines can also indicate better immune function (Herbert
and Cohen, 1993). Given these specific physiological indi-
cators, if SWB at work is related to better physiological
4 Health Psychology Open 
functioning, we would generally expect that SWB would be
negatively related to cardiovascular and endocrine indica-
tors, but positively related to most immune indicators.
Complementary perspectives of
occupational stress and positive
psychology
With these definitions of SWB in physiological functioning
in place, we now provide a brief overview of the two tradi-
tions our theoretical model integrates--the occupational
stress tradition and the positive psychology tradition.
Occupational stress tradition
Research in the occupational stress tradition focuses on the
effects of negative work conditions on impaired physical
and psychological health. Examples of negative work con-
ditions include--but are not limited to--hazardous physi-
cal working environments (e.g. exposure to toxins, extreme
temperatures), non-optimal workload (i.e. too much or too
difficult work), and negative aspects of the social context
(e.g. bullying, sexual harassment, workplace conflict). A
key goal of research in the occupational stress tradition is to
identify important negative work conditions and to advance
theory explaining how and when these conditions harm
worker health and well-being with the goal of developing
and promoting interventions that protect workers against
these negative conditions. Some of the most prominent
theories in this tradition include the Demand-Control
Model (Karasek, 1979), the person-environment fit model
(French et al., 1982), the Transactional Model of Stress
(Lazarus, 1999), and the Job-Demands Resources Model
(Demerouti et al., 2001).
Positive psychology tradition
In contrast, while research in the occupational stress tradition
focuses on identifying negative work conditions and under-
standing their effects and how to alleviate their effects,
research in the positive psychology tradition focuses on iden-
tifying positive emotions and resources that promote and
protect health and well-being and understanding how to cul-
tivate these emotions and resources in workers. Research in
the positive psychology tradition is relatively new compared
to research in the occupational stress tradition, and fewer
theoretical frameworks have developed. Currently, a leading
theoretical framework relevant to the current topic is the
Broaden-and-Buildtheoryofpositiveemotions(Fredrickson,
2001), which delineates health-enhancing benefits of posi-
tive emotions and positive resources such as social support
and resilience. Because research in the occupational stress
tradition and the positive psychology tradition both provide
important findings relevant to the link between SWB and
physiological functioning, yet do so through the distinct
approaches of protecting workers from negative work condi-
tions (in the case of occupational stress) and promoting posi-
tive emotions and resources (in the case of positive
psychology), they represent complementary perspectives,
which can be integrated to form a more holistic understand-
ing of the relationship between SWB and physiological
functioning.
An integrative framework
We propose an integrative framework that links worker
SWB and physiological health as shown in Figure 1. In our
model, we explain the relationship between worker SWB
and physiological functioning as a result of the protecting
and promoting influence of SWB on physiological func-
tioning and also as a result of the common influences of
stress and personal resources. Consistent with the positive
psychological perspective, our model emphasizes that
SWB promotes physiological functioning by directly
enhancing physiological functioning. Consistent with occu-
pational stress perspectives, our model highlights the role
of work stress as a negative influence on both SWB and
physiological functioning. Finally, consistent with both
positive psychology perspectives and occupational stress
perspectives, our model also highlights the importance of
personal resources such as hope, resilience, optimism, and
self-efficacy in protecting workers against the effects of
work stress on SWB and physiological functioning. As
such, SWB is linked to physiological health because of its
causal influence on physiological functioning, but also
because of the common influences of work stress and per-
sonal resources on both SWB and physiological function-
ing. We elaborate on these concepts and their linkages in
the following.
SWB influences physiological functioning
Influence of positive emotions. Exemplifying the positive psy-
chology tradition, the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive
emotions explains that positive emotions promote health
and well-being by broadening one's awareness and encour-
aging novel thoughts and actions, which eventually builds
enduring social, intellectual, and emotional resources (Fre-
drickson, 1998, 2001). Because positive emotions generate
opposite effects on awareness than negative emotions,
which are known to narrow rather than broaden awareness,
they serve as an antidote to the cardiovascular effects of
negative emotions. Negative emotions are known to increase
cardiovascular reactivity, which, if experienced frequently,
can lead to heart disease and cardiac events (Kubzansky and
Kawachi, 2000). An important determinant of whether fre-
quent cardiovascular reactivity becomes harmful is how
quickly individuals return to baseline levels of cardiovascu-
lar functioning after events that increase reactivity. Research
has shown that individuals experiencing positive emotions
Kuykendall and Tay 5
have a speedier recovery from the cardiovascular effects of
negative emotions than individuals who do not experience
positive emotions (Fredrickson and Levenson, 1998). This
benefit of positive emotions is referred to in the Broaden-
and-Build framework as the undoing hypothesis. The key
point of the undoing hypothesis is that positive emotions
protect physiological health by undoing the effects of nega-
tive emotions.
The positive psychological tradition has also shown
that, in addition to protecting physiological health against
the effects of negative emotions, positive emotions also
appear to directly promote physiological health. Positive
emotions, particularly deactivated positive emotions such
as feelings of calmness and relaxation, decrease heart rate,
blood pressure, cortisol levels, and inflammation (Pressman
and Cohen, 2005). These relationships are independent of
negative emotions and depressed mood, indicating that
positive emotions have effects on physiological health over
and above the effects of negative emotions (Steptoe et al.,
2009). While few studies have looked specifically at the
link between job affect and physiological functioning,
those that have supported the link between deactivated pos-
itive emotions and improved physiological functioning
(Shirom et al., 2009).
Furthermore, positive affect also promotes and protects
physiological functioning by increasing the likelihood of
individuals engaging in behaviors that improve physiologi-
cal functioning and decreasing the likelihood of engaging
in behaviors that harm physiological functioning. For
instance, happy people--and by implication happy work-
ers--are more likely to exercise (Lox et al., 1999; Mishra,
1992; Riddick, 1985; Veenhoven, 1984; Watson, 1988;
Watson et al., 1992) and are less likely to engage in
smoking, unhealthy eating, and drug and alcohol abuse
(Graham et al., 2004; Piko et al., 2002). Thus, positive
affect may influence physiological function through health
behaviors.
Influence of job satisfaction. In contrast to positive and nega-
tive feelings, job satisfaction is presented in our model as
having a more distal influence on physiological function-
ing. Because satisfaction evaluations are not thought to
activate the same physiological processes as emotions, sim-
ply being satisfied or dissatisfied with one's job is not, by
itself, likely to promote or protect health. However, because
of the proposed bi-directional relationship between job sat-
isfaction and job affect, we do expect a link between job
satisfaction and physiological functioning. As shown in the
model, evaluations of one's job likely influence feelings in
the workplace and, as such, have a distal influence on phys-
iological functioning via positive and negative feelings.
The direct influence of SWB on physiological functioning,
driven by the effects of positive emotions, negative emo-
tions, and the distal influence of job satisfaction, is shown
by Link 3 in Figure 1.
Work stress impairs SWB and physiological
functioning
While positive psychology focuses on positive emotions
and resources, the rich tradition stemming from the "dis-
ease" model of health emphasizes the negative effects of
stress on workers and the features that mitigate such effects.
The occupational stress perspective has conventionally
focused on stress as an effect of negative work characteris-
tics. In this tradition, the JD-R model (Demerouti et al.,
2001)--an adaptation of the Demand-Control Model
(Karasek, 1979)--asserts that individuals will experience
stress from their work when it makes high mental, physical,
emotional, and other demands while affording few job
resources such as support, autonomy, and feedback, subse-
quently leading to poor SWB (i.e. negative feelings of
fatigue and exhaustion) and health problems.
This process is depicted in our model as job conditions
inducing work stress (Link 4) and work stress influencing
both SWB (Link 5) and physiological functioning (Link 6).
We conceptualize job conditions as objective or perceived
characteristics of the job or work environment that may
generate demands or afford resources and stress as a psy-
chological reaction to demanding conditions. We adopt
definitions of job demands and job resources from the JD-R
model, defining job demands as "those physical, social, or
organizational aspects of the job that require sustained
physical or mental effort and are therefore associated with
certain physiological and psychological costs" and job
resources as
those physical, social, or organizational aspects of the job that
may do any of the following: (a) be functional in achieving
work goals; (b) reduce job demands and the associated
physiological and psychological costs; (c) stimulate personal
growth and development. (Demerouti et al., 2001: 501)
Common examples of job demands include interper-
sonal conflict, emotional labor, work overload, job ambigu-
ity, and unsafe work environments. In contrast, common
examples of job resources include feedback, job control,
and social support.
Work stress and SWB. The relationship between stress and
SWB has garnered strong evidence. A recent meta-analysis
found the unadjusted correlation between stress, measured
as anxiety and strain, and job satisfaction to be -.32 (Far-
agher et al., 2005). Numerous studies examining various
work contexts have shown that specific job characteristics
are stressful, leading to lower job satisfaction (Bogg and
Cooper, 1995; Evans and Carrère, 1991; Mark and Smith,
2012). Research has also found that stressful work charac-
teristics are related to negative job evaluations and feelings,
including job dissatisfaction and emotional exhaustion
(Dollard and Winefield, 1998). Experience sampling
research using worker samples has demonstrated that
6 Health Psychology Open 
stressful events are related to experiences of greater nega-
tive feelings (Teuchmann et al., 1999; Van Eck et al., 1998;
Zohar, 1999). The stress­SWB link appears to be pan-cul-
tural as a representative sample across the world found that
the experience of stress predicts lower SWB (Ng et al.,
2009).
Work stress and physiological functioning.Work stress not
only affects SWB but also influences physiological func-
tioning. Much of the research in the occupational stress tra-
dition has emphasized the link between job conditions and
physiological functioning--with work stress being the pos-
ited, but often not explicitly measured, link between these
conditions and physiological outcomes. Research has
shown that job conditions such as high job demands and
low job control influence physiological outcomes such as
cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure (Gallo et al., 2004;
Kunz-Ebrecht et al., 2004). Despite the relatively low num-
ber of studies documenting the link between work stress
and measures of worker physiological functioning (e.g.
Almadi et al., 2012), compelling evidence for the influence
of stress on SWB has been shown by employee stress man-
agement interventions. A meta-analysis on the effective-
ness of employee stress management interventions revealed
that such interventions enhance physiological functioning
(d=.29; Richardson and Rothstein, 2008). Furthermore, the
effects of work stress on the disease endpoints proximally
influenced by physiological functioning, and the biological
processes by which poor physiological functioning leads to
diseases, have been clearly documented (Miller et al.,
2007).
Personal resources enhance SWB and
physiological functioning
In our model, we propose that personal resources also pro-
vide an important link between SWB and physiological
health. The accumulation of personal resources can enhance
SWB and physiological health. To avoid confusion with job
conditions, our model focuses solely on personal resources,
"the psychological characteristics or aspects of the self that
are generally associated with resiliency and that refer to the
ability to control and impact one's environment success-
fully" (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014: 49), such as self-efficacy,
self-esteem, optimism, hope, and resilience.
Personal resources and SWB. Personal resources have been
a focus of both positive psychological perspectives and
occupational stress perspectives. Positive psychological
perspectives illuminate how SWB can enhance personal
resources, which in turn lead to higher SWB. One of the
fundamental tenets of the Broaden-and-Build theory (Fre-
drickson, 1998, 2001) is that positive emotions broaden
attention and influence thought-action repertoires--the
range of potential actions the body and mind are prepared
to engage in--such that individuals are more likely to
engage in novel and exploratory behaviors such as meeting
new people or playing a new game. In this respect, positive
emotions stand in contrast to negative emotions, which
tend to be associated with very narrow action tendencies
such as fleeing as a response to experiencing fear.
Although novel and exploratory behavior is not immedi-
ately critical to safety or survival, as are the immediate ben-
efits of specific fight-or-flight action tendencies associated
with negative emotions, such novel and exploratory behav-
iors generated by positive emotions serve to build impor-
tant personal resources over time. The Broaden-and-Build
theory posits "positive spirals" or feedback loops between
SWB and personal resources such that SWB facilitates per-
sonal resources via novel and exploratory behaviors and, in
turn, personal resources enhance SWB. The bi-directional
nature of the relationship between personal resources and
SWB leads to a self-perpetuating system that underpins
both the development of lasting personal resources and
long-lasting SWB changes (see review by Garland et al.,
2010). Applying this concept to workers, an experimental
intervention that manipulated worker positive emotions via
loving kindness meditations influenced a wide range of
personal resources, which subsequently increased life satis-
faction, providing support for the bi-directional relation-
ship between SWB and personal resources (Fredrickson
et al., 2008).
Contextualizing the concept of positive resources to the
work context, researchers have developed a taxonomy of
job-related positive personal resources, including hope,
resilience, optimism, and self-efficacy (Luthans et al.,
2007; Luthans and Youssef, 2007). Recent longitudinal
studies have shown evidence for a bi-directional relation-
ship between job-related personal resources and worker
SWB. For instance, job-related positive emotions predicted
job-related personal resources (e.g. hope, optimism, and
self-efficacy in the work context) 6months later (Ouweneel
et al., 2012), and psychological capital--a combination of
hope, optimism, efficacy, and resiliency--predicted psy-
chological well-being, which includes an affective compo-
nent, 3weeks later, controlling for psychological well-being
at Time 1 (Avey et al., 2010). Links 7 and 8 in our model
reflect this bi-directional relationship between personal
resources and SWB.
The link between SWB and personal resources has also
been incorporated into the occupational stress tradition, as
the JD-R model has been expanded to include personal
resources (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007). Specifically, the
JD-R model (Demerouti et al., 2001) emphasizes that while
negative job characteristics (e.g. job demands) cause stress
and harm health and well-being, positive job characteristics
(e.g. job resources) increase personal resources and subse-
quently enhance employee well-being. In the JD-R model,
personal resources function as a mechanism by which job
resources influence SWB. Specifically, researchers have
Kuykendall and Tay 7
posited that job resources activate employees' personal
resources, allowing them to feel capable, perform confi-
dently, be satisfied and happy with their work, and experi-
ence fewer negative feelings such as exhaustion (Luthans
et al., 2006; Xanthopoulou et al., 2007). Researchers have
found initial support that personal resources (i.e. self-effi-
cacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism)
mediate the relationship between job resources (i.e. auton-
omy, social support, supervisory coaching, and opportuni-
ties for professional development) and feelings of exhaustion
and engagement (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007, 2009b).
Furthermore, researchers have suggested that personal
resources can reduce perceptions of poor job conditions,
which subsequently reduces stress. Such reasoning is con-
sistent with interactional models of stress, which assert that
resources such as optimism can influence both the percep-
tion of and the response to one's environment. Some stud-
ies provide support for this reciprocal relationship (Kohn
and Schooler, 1982; Xanthopoulou et al., 2007, 2009a). For
instance, in a sample of Dutch employees, personal
resources (i.e. optimism, self-efficacy, and organizational-
based self-esteem) predicted the perception of job resources
(e.g. autonomy, social support, supervisory coaching, and
professional development) (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007).
Links 9 and 10 in our model capture the bi-directional rela-
tionship between job resources and personal resources.
Furthermore, the path from job conditions to SWB via
Links 9 and 7 reflect personal resources as a mediator of
the relationship between job conditions and SWB.
Personal resources and physiological functioning.Personal
resources likely mitigate the influence of work stress on
cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine functioning
(Link 11). Research in the positive psychological tradition
has shown that individuals who possess the personal
resources such as optimism and hope tend to engage in
more effective stress coping strategies (Fontaine et al.,
1993; Scheier et al., 1986; Snyder et al., 1991) and, as a
result, tend to experience quicker alleviation from stress
and its associated effects on cardiovascular, immune, and
neuroendocrine functioning.
Such reasoning is consistent with findings showing a
link between personal resources and health outcomes. In
fact, studies have shown that optimism is robustly associ-
ated with protection against poor cardiovascular function-
ing, as indicated by optimistic individuals showing a slower
rate of carotid atherosclerosis progression and a reduced
risk of developing hypertension than less optimistic indi-
viduals (Boehm and Kubzansky, 2012; Matthews et al.,
2004; Richman et al., 2005) and optimism being associated
with low inflammation--an indicator of good physiologi-
cal functioning (Ikeda et al., 2011). Finally, a recent meta-
analysis found that optimism predicts immune functioning
(r=.21) and physiological functioning (r=.17) in prospec-
tive studies (Rasmussen et al., 2009).
Job conditions
Finally, we argue that job conditions--objective or per-
ceived characteristics of the job or work environment that
may generate demands or afford resources--have a direct
influence on SWB, and subsequently on physiological func-
tioning, that is not mediated by work stress or positive
resources. A central tenet of the JD-R model is that negative
job conditions (i.e. job demands) cause stress (Link 4),
which subsequently harms well-being and health (Links 5
and 6), whereas positive job conditions (i.e. job resources)
generate personal resources (Link 9), which enhances well-
being and protects health (Links 7 and 11). These two pre-
dictions have garnered strong support (Schaufeli and Taris,
2014). Negative job conditions, specifically job demands,
evoke negative employee reactions, particularly in the form
of job dissatisfaction and negative feelings, whereas posi-
tive job resources lead to positive reactions, including job
satisfaction and positive feelings. For instance, workers who
reported job demands in the form of high safety risk percep-
tions were less satisfied with their jobs than workers who
did not report high safety risks. In contrast, workers who
reported positive job resources in the form of a positive
safety climate had higher levels of job satisfaction than
workers who did not report a positive safety climate (Nielsen
et al., 2011).
We propose that, in addition to job conditions influenc-
ing SWB via work stress and personal resources, job condi-
tions can also directly influence SWB because of their
effects on feelings other than stress. Feelings of stress and
anxiety are characterized by high activation and negative
valence (Russell, 1980). While such feelings are a common
response to negative job characteristics, they are likely not
the only affective response evoked by negative job charac-
teristics and work events (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996).
For instance, interpersonal conflict at work or role overload
may cause individuals to feel sad or disappointed, in addi-
tion to feeling stressed. Such low-activation negative emo-
tions reflect a possible linkage between job conditions and
SWB that is not mediated by stress. Link 12 in Figure 1
shows the direct influence of job conditions on SWB that is
prompted by job conditions that evoke low-activation nega-
tive emotions.
Discussion
Theoretical contributions
Our perspective is the first to integrate occupational stress
and positive psychological perspectives on the relationship
between SWB and physiological health. This integration is
crucial because examining the relationship from only one
of these perspectives omits important causal paths and
potential confounding factors. For instance, the occupa-
tional stress perspective focuses on the effects of work con-
ditions and the personal and organizational factors that
8 Health Psychology Open 
mitigate the effects of those job conditions on both SWB
and health. However, by omitting the direct influence of
SWB on physiological functioning, the effects of factors
such as job conditions and work stress may be overesti-
mated. In contrast, by focusing primarily on the mecha-
nisms linking positive emotions and health, the positive
psychological perspective is limited because of a lack of
consideration of the broader factors confounding the rela-
tionship between SWB and physiological functioning such
as job conditions and work stress. Our model provides a
framework for incorporating the important perspectives of
each approach such that no key confounding factors are
omitted.
By showing that the relationship between SWB and
physiological functioning is partially driven by common
influences of work stress, personal resources, and job con-
ditions, our integrative model provides the foundation for
interventions that simultaneously enhance both SWB and
physiological functioning by targeting their common ante-
cedents rather than focusing solely on the antecedents
emphasized either by the occupational stress perspective or
the positive psychological perspective.
Implications for research
Our integrative model implies that, by targeting both work
stress and personal resources, researchers can simultane-
ously enhance SWB and physiological functioning. A great
deal of research has identified effective interventions to
improve job conditions (National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health, 2013) and reduce work stress
(Richardson and Rothstein, 2008). Fewer studies have
examined interventions to enhance worker personal
resources (Kirk et al., 2011; McNatt and Judge, 2008),
although some initial evidence shows that psychological
capital--a combination of hope, optimism, efficacy, and
resiliency--can be developed in employees using short
"micro-interventions" (Luthans et al., 2006). However, no
studies have examined interventions simultaneously target-
ing personal resources, work stress, and job conditions.
Future research is needed to determine how to best com-
bine interventions targeting all three of these identified
common influences. Two key issues that need to be
addressed when designing integrative interventions are the
level of the intervention (organizational or individual) and
the degree of "match" between job conditions, stress, and
personal resources.
Level of intervention. Concerning the level of intervention,
interventions targeting stress and personal resources can
have individual- or organization-level targets. For instance,
work stress interventions focused on the individual often
target coping styles, meditation, and progressive muscle
relaxation, whereas interventions focused on the organiza-
tion often target job conditions that commonly evoke stress
such as ambiguity, interpersonal conflict, safety problems,
and high job demands. Similarly, personal resource inter-
ventions focused on the individual often target self-effi-
cacy, whereas interventions focused on the organization
target developing positive job resources such as supportive
work environments.
While individual-level variables (e.g. stress and
resources) are more proximal to SWB and physiological
functioning than organization-level variables (e.g. job con-
ditions), choosing an individual-directed intervention,
rather than an organization-directed intervention, to reduce
negative work experiences such as stress can send a mes-
sage to employees that they, rather than the organization,
are culpable for their negative experiences. Because of this
risk, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (2013) has emphasized the importance of
approaches that seek to simultaneously address organiza-
tion-level and individual-level causes of negative experi-
ences. Furthermore, the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (2013) has provided compelling evi-
dence that workers are most likely to benefit from indi-
vidual health-promotion interventions when the relevant
organization-level features are simultaneously addressed.
As such, interventions targeting work stress need to ensure
that any individual-directed solutions are complemented
by organization-directed solutions.
Whether the same principle applies to personal resources
is a topic for further research. Whereas a number of inter-
ventions have targeted job resources, fewer studies have
targeted individual-level personal resources. Further
research is needed on effective individual-directed personal
resource interventions, particularly whether interventions
are most effective when both job resources and personal
resources are targeted.
In summary, we suggest that researchers can enhance
SWB and physiological functioning by designing interven-
tions that simultaneously improve job conditions, enhance
personal resources, and reduce work stress. However, in
doing so, careful attention needs to be given to whether the
interventions target the individual or the organization.
When addressing negative individual features such as
stress, it is important that employees are not implicitly
blamed for their experiences. Researchers can ensure this
by including both individual-level and organization-level
interventions.
Triple-matching. In addition to the level of the intervention
targets, it is also important to consider the "match" across
specific types of job conditions, stressors, and personal
resources. The triple-match principle (De Jonge and Dor-
mann, 2006) posits that resources are most likely to miti-
gate the effects of stress when stressors (conceptualized as
similar to our definition of job conditions), strains (concep-
tualized as similar to our definition of stress), and resources
are of the same type (i.e. emotional, cognitive, or physical).
Kuykendall and Tay 9
Initial research appears to support the matching principle,
particularly for emotional and physical stressors (De Jonge
and Dormann, 2006). Because personal resources, as con-
ceptualized in our article, are largely emotional, personal
resource interventions may be most effective when used in
contexts involving emotional stressors (e.g. emotional
labor). As such, future research should examine whether
the type of stressor is a boundary condition on our integra-
tive model or whether personal resources can buffer the
effects of stress on the SWB and health of workers even
when the stress is primarily cognitive or physical in nature.
Conclusion
Both employee SWB and health are of great importance to
workers and organizations. Because employee SWB and
physiological outcomes share common antecedents, inter-
ventions targeting these common antecedents are expected
to result in enhanced SWB and physiological outcomes. By
focusing employee interventions on the common anteced-
ents of stress and resources, organizations can enhance and
protect both SWB and health.
