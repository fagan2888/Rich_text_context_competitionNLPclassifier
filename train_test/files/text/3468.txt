Introduction
Both microscopic colitis (MC) and irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) are important differential diag-
noses in individuals presenting with chronic diar-
rhoea, especially among patients with a
macroscopically normal colonoscopy. IBS is a
chronic functional bowel disorder, often affecting
younger individuals,1 and characterized by
abdominal pain in association with a disordered
bowel habit.2 The condition affects approximately
10­20% of individuals globally.1 In contrast, MC
often presents in middle age with chronic watery
diarrhoea, and some studies suggest that the pres-
ence of abdominal pain is a negative predictor for
MC.3,4 In addition, MC is rarer and has a reported
incidence of approximately 9 per 100,000 person
years for the two main histological subtypes:5 col-
lagenous colitis (CC), characterized by a distinct
subepithelial collagen band, and lymphocytic
colitis (LC), with intraepithelial lymphocytosis.
Despite these differences in epidemiology, given
the high prevalence of IBS, and the similarities in
some of the presenting features, there is the

Abstract
Background: Patients with microscopic colitis (MC) often present with abdominal pain and
diarrhoea, and previous data suggest that there may be overlap between MC and irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in patients with
MC, and assess the impact of these symptoms on psychological health and quality of life.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of individuals with a histological diagnosis of
MC, collecting demographic data, Rome III IBS-type symptoms, and mood, somatization, and
quality of life data.
Results: In total, 151 (31.6%) of 478 individuals with a new diagnosis of MC completed
questionnaires, 52 (34.4%) of whom reported IBS-type symptoms. The commonest histological
subtype was collagenous colitis (51.7%, n = 78), followed by lymphocytic colitis (39.1%, n =
59). Individuals with IBS-type symptoms had significantly higher levels of anxiety [Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety score 8.6 versus 5.1, p < 0.001], depression
(HADS depression score 6.2 versus 3.6, p = 0.001), and somatoform-type behaviour (Patient
Health Questionnaire 15 score 12.7 versus 8.0, p < 0.001) compared with individuals who did
not. Those with IBS-type symptoms scored significantly worse across all domains of the 36-
item Short Form questionnaire, except for physical functioning.
Conclusions: More than one third of individuals with MC reported IBS-type symptoms,
although whether this is due to ongoing inflammation is unclear. These individuals had
higher levels of anxiety, depression, and somatization, and impaired quality of life. Identifying
concomitant IBS in individuals with MC may have important implications for management
decisions.

potential for substantial overlap of symptoms
between IBS and MC. This issue is important as
it could lead to confusion between the two, delay-
ing the diagnosis and commencement of effective
therapies in patients with MC,6,7 or leading to
unnecessary colonoscopy and biopsy in patients
with probable IBS.3 The degree of overlap
between the two conditions has been examined in
meta-analyses, with up to one in three individuals
with MC reporting symptoms compatible with
IBS.8,9 However, there were few available studies
examining this issue.
Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of IBS are
more likely to suffer from coexistent mood disor-
der, anxiety, and neuroticism compared with
healthy individuals,10 and to report lower quality
of life.11,12 When symptoms compatible with IBS
are reported by patients with other organic gas-
trointestinal (GI) conditions, such as idiopathic
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), they appear
to impact on both mood and quality of life. In a
large cross-sectional study conducted among 378
patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease,
levels of psychological comorbidity were signifi-
cantly higher among those reporting IBS-type
symptoms compared with patients with quiescent
disease, and quality of life was reduced to a simi-
lar degree to that seen in patients with confirmed
IBD activity.13
Although studies conducted among patients with
MC have shown that quality of life is impaired in
both CC and LC,14­17 the prevalence of mood
disorders, such as anxiety, depression, or somati-
zation, is not clear. Data from another cross-sec-
tional study, conducted among individuals with
MC thought to be in disease remission clinically,
demonstrated that some patients continue to
report GI symptoms, which seem to impair
health-related quality of life.15 Furthermore, in a
cross-sectional study of Swedish women, individ-
uals with a diagnosis of MC plus concomitant
IBS-like symptoms had a greater impairment in
psychological wellbeing compared with those
who did not report IBS-like symptoms, but the
authors did not report levels of anxiety, depres-
sion, or somatization specifically.18
We therefore conducted this cross-sectional sur-
vey to further assess the prevalence of IBS-type
symptoms and mood disorders in a large cohort
of patients with a histological diagnosis of MC,
and assess the impact of symptoms compatible
with IBS on psychological health including levels
of anxiety, depression, somatization, and health-
related quality of life. Our a priori hypothesis was
that the presence of IBS-type symptoms would
impact negatively on mood and quality of life in
patients with MC, as we have seen in patients
with IBD in our centre.13,19
Materials and methods
Participants and setting
Potential participants were adult patients identi-
fied as having a new histological diagnosis of MC
from histology reports after presenting to the
Leeds Teaching Hospitals over a 6-year period,
between January 2010 and December 2015. Our
institution, based in the north of England, pro-
vides secondary care services to a population of
800,000 people. For all patients diagnosed with
MC during this period we confirmed survival sta-
tus, ensured there was no evidence of a diagnosis
of cognitive impairment, and sought an up-to-
date contact address, using hospital records.
Diagnosis of microscopic colitis
The diagnosis of MC was according to the follow-
ing criteria: CC was defined as the presence of a
subepithelial collagen band of at least 10 µm in
thickness, in association with diffuse chronic
inflammation; LC was defined using a threshold
of more than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per
100 epithelial cells, with associated diffuse chronic
inflammation, but no thickening of the subepithe-
lial collagen band. Individuals, in whom the
recorded pathology diagnosis did not specify the
subtype of MC, were classified as `MC, not oth-
erwise specified (MC-NOS)' as, at our centre, the
diagnoses of incomplete collagenous or lympho-
cytic colitis are not used. Other investigators have
demonstrated that there is little interobserver
variability in the diagnosis of MC.20 Finally, indi-
viduals with a previous histology report suggest-
ing a prior known diagnosis of MC were excluded
from the analysis.
Data collection and synthesis
All potentially eligible participants were sent an
invitation letter, participant information leaflet,
written consent form, and a questionnaire by
post. The postal survey took place between June
2016 and February 2017. All nonresponders to
JS Kane, AJ Irvine et al.

the initial mail out received a second postal ques-
tionnaire. The study was approved by the local
research ethics committee (Yorkshire & The
Humber, Leeds West, United Kingdom) in
January 2016.
Demographic data. All participants were asked to
provide the following demographic data: sex, age,
ethnicity, marital status, educational level, tobacco
and alcohol use, and weight (in kg) and height (in
m), which were used to calculate body mass index
(BMI). We also asked participants to complete a
checklist of medications previously reported as
being associated with MC,21 and respond to ques-
tions regarding the presence of common associ-
ated autoimmune diseases,22 including coeliac
disease, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, autoimmune hepatitis, and type 1 dia-
betes. Individuals were asked to record if they
were given appropriate drug treatment after their
diagnosis, and how effective they judged it to have
been using a four-point Likert scale (`very effec-
tive', `effective', `no effect', or `made symptoms
worse'). These data were dichotomized into two
groups: those with effective or very effective treat-
ment and those without.
Reference standard used to define presence of
IBS-type symptoms.
Because our study was
designed and commenced prior to the publication
of the Rome IV criteria,2 the presence of IBS-type
symptoms was assessed via the Rome III crite-
ria.23 IBS-type symptoms were defined as present
when participants reported abdominal discom-
fort or pain occurring at least 3 days per month
over the past 3 months, with the onset of discom-
fort at least 6 months previously, and associated
with two or more of the following: an improve-
ment of pain or discomfort with the passage of
stool, more or less frequent bowel movements, or
looser or firmer stools.
Mood and somatization data.
To assess for the
presence of either anxiety or depression, partici-
pants were asked to complete the validated
14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) questionnaire.24 This includes seven
questions screening for the presence of anxiety,
and another seven questions for depression. Each
question is scored from 0 to 3, resulting in a maxi-
mum potential score of 21 for anxiety or depres-
sion separately. The severity of anxiety and
depression symptoms was then graded according
to three categories: normal (total depression or
anxiety scores 0­7), borderline normal (8­10),
and abnormal (11).
In order to assess for the presence of somatization
we used the Patient Health Questionnaire 15
(PHQ-15), a validated questionnaire enquiring
about the presence of 15 specific somatic symp-
toms occurring within the previous 4 weeks.25
This is derived from the validated full PHQ tool,
and has been seen to capture over 90% of physi-
cal symptoms described in the outpatient setting.
Symptoms were graded into three levels of sever-
ity: `not bothered at all' (scored as 0), `bothered a
little' (scored as 1), or `bothered a lot' (scored as
2), giving a total possible score of 30. The severity
of somatization was categorized into high (total
score 15), medium (10­14), low (5­9), and
minimal (4) levels, as has been previously
recommended.
Quality of life data.The medical outcomes study
36-item Short Form (SF-36) score is a validated
questionnaire assessing both physical and mental
health status,26 and was used to assess health-
related quality of life. The 36 questions are
grouped into eight domains: physical functioning,
role limitations due to physical health, role limita-
tions due to emotional health, energy or fatigue,
emotional wellbeing, social functioning, pain, and
general health. Participants were asked to score
each question from 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating more favourable quality of life.
Statistical analysis
We compared baseline demographic characteris-
tics including medication, prevalence of IBS-type
symptoms, HADS scores, PHQ-15 scores, SF-36
scores, and presence or absence of anxiety,
depression, or somatization between subtypes of
MC using a 2 test for categorical variables, and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for con-
tinuous data. We then compared baseline demo-
graphic characteristics, HADS scores, PHQ-15
scores, SF-36 scores, and presence or absence of
anxiety, depression, or somatization among those
with IBS-type symptoms and those without, again
using a 2 test for categorical variables and a one-
way ANOVA for continuous data. As the PHQ-
15 contains three GI symptoms, we repeated the
analyses for the PHQ-12, which is the same ques-
tionnaire but with the three GI symptoms
removed.27 A two-tailed p value less than 0.01
was considered to be statistically significant for all

analyses, due to multiple comparisons. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA).
Results
Over the 6-year study period, a total of 568 patients
were diagnosed with MC. We excluded 90 of these
individuals, because 70 had died, 13 had a record
of cognitive impairment, and 7 had a missing or
incomplete home address. Therefore, 478 individ-
uals were sent a postal questionnaire. We received
157 completed questionnaires after two mail outs,
a response rate of 32.8% (Figure 1). Of these, six
individuals had a previous histological diagnosis of
MC prior to 2010 so were excluded from the final
analysis. Overall, there were no significant differ-
ences between responders and nonresponders in
terms of age, sex, or MC subtype. These data are
provided in Table 1.
Among the 151 eligible responders, 78 (51.7%)
individuals had a diagnosis of CC, 59 (39.1%)
LC, and 14 (9.3%) MC-NOS. Of the eligible
responders 74.8% (n = 113) were female, and had
a mean age of 68.0 years [standard deviation (SD)
± 9.8]. Other data for all responders, and by MC
subtype, are provided in Table 2. In all subtypes,
there was a high frequency of individuals who
reported taking a drug known to be a potential risk
factor for MC; the most frequently reported medi-
cations being nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) or proton pump inhibitors
(PPIs), with 98 (64.9%) patients taking either of
these medications. The presence of any coexistent
autoimmune disease was reported by 46 (30.5%)
individuals. Regarding coeliac disease specifically,
this was significantly more likely in LC [10 patients
(16.9%)] compared with CC [1 patient (1.3%)]
orMC-NOS(0patients)(p=0.001).Macroscopic
features, such as ulceration, reduced vascularity,
erythema, mucosal congestion, petechiae, or lin-
ear scarring were present at the index colonoscopy
in 18 (11.9%) individuals with MC, including 5
(3.3%) individuals who had an endoscopic diag-
nosis of colitis. In terms of levels of anxiety,
depression, and somatization, 15.1% of patients
with MC reported abnormal levels of anxiety,
8.8% abnormal levels of depression, and 14.7%

Prevalence of, risk factors for, and impact of
IBS-type symptoms in patients with MC
Overall, 52 (34.4%) individuals reported IBS-
type symptoms according to the Rome III crite-
ria, with no significant difference between MC
subtypes. Of the individual components of the
Rome III criteria, only the presence of abdominal
pain or discomfort for at least 1 day per week
(67.3% versus 7.8%, p < 0.001) distinguished
those with IBS-type symptoms from those with-
out. There was a trend towards individuals with
IBS-type symptoms being younger, and the fre-
quency of individuals reporting use of PPIs was
higher, although the result was not significant
(Table 3). However, there was no significant
association between IBS-type symptoms and
macroscopic abnormalities seen at the index colo-
noscopy. Those with IBS-type symptoms had sig-
nificantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and
somatization. The latter remained the case when
the PHQ-12 was used, rather than the PHQ-15.
In terms of quality of life, patients with MC who
reported IBS-type symptoms also scored signifi-
cantly worse across all domains of the SF-36,
except for physical functioning.
In total, 77 individuals (51.0%) reported receiv-
ing drug therapy for MC, and 60 of these were
prescribed glucocorticosteroids, including 52
(65.8%) individuals given budesonide and 8
(10.1%) given prednisolone. Other medications
included loperamide in 15 (19.0%) and 5-amino-
salicylates in 2 (2.5%). In those who were pre-
scribed medication, 64 (83.1%) indicated their
treatment was effective or very effective, but there
was no significant difference seen with respect to
the reported effectiveness of drug therapy received
for MC, either according to subtype or between
individuals reporting IBS-type symptoms and
those who did not. There were also no significant
differences in anxiety, depression, somatization,
or quality of life in those reporting receiving effec-
tive or very effective drug treatment for MC com-
pared with those describing that drug therapy was
ineffective or worsened symptoms.
Discussion
This cross-sectional study has demonstrated that
one third of patients with MC report IBS-type
symptoms. Individuals with MC who reported
these symptoms had significantly higher levels of
anxiety, depression, and somatoform-type behav-
iour than those who did not. Health-related qual-
ity of life was significantly reduced in patients
with IBS-type symptoms, and this was consistent
across all domains of the SF-36, with the excep-
tion of physical functioning. The presence of
macroscopic evidence of inflammation at the
index colonoscopy did not seem to influence the
likelihood of reporting these symptoms, nor did

having received an effective therapy for MC,
although rates of IBS-type symptoms were gener-
ally higher among those patients who reported
that prescribed therapy was either ineffective or
made their symptoms worse.
This study surveyed a large population of patients
with a histological diagnosis of MC, and recruited
only individuals accessing secondary care ser-
vices, rather than patients with more complex
conditions referred for a tertiary care opinion. As
a result, these data are likely to be representative
of, and generalizable to, usual clinical practice. A
further novel aspect is that this study was con-
ducted in the United Kingdom, a geographical
region from where epidemiological data concern-
ing MC are sparse. In addition, we report data
from a large MC cohort and examine the impact
of IBS-type symptoms on levels of anxiety,
depression, somatization, and health-related
quality of life in both male and female patients
with MC, using validated questionnaires.
Weaknesses of this study include the fact that we
used the Rome III criteria for IBS,23 which have
now been superseded by the Rome IV criteria,2
but this was unavoidable as our study was designed
and commenced before the publication of the
Rome IV criteria. In addition, we included indi-
viduals diagnosed with MC from 2010 onwards,
and therefore recall bias may have affected the
reporting of medication use and some of the other
data we collected. However, the validated symp-
tom and mood questionnaires we used do require
contemporaneous answers. Data were not availa-
ble regarding the results of investigations to
exclude other causes of IBS-type symptoms,
where these were requested. This means we can-
not exclude the possibility that some individuals
who reported these symptoms had an organic
explanation, such as small intestinal bacterial
overgrowth or bile salt malabsorption, both of
which may present with symptoms that can be
confused with diarrhoea-predominant IBS.28­30
Participants in the study responded to a postal

questionnaire. This may have introduced volun-
teer bias, where those choosing to take part were
intrinsically different from those who did not
return a questionnaire, and only one in three
potential participants returned a questionnaire,
which may limit generalizability. It may be that
those with more severe symptoms, low mood, or
poor quality of life were more likely to return a
questionnaire, and this potential bias may have
contributed to our findings. It may also be that
patients with MC with psychological comorbidity,
such as anxiety, depression, and somatoform
behaviour are more likely to report GI symptoms,
and that this explains our findings. Studies that
also recruit controls without psychological comor-
bidity would be required to examine this issue.
Our study was limited by the lack of a control
group, meaning we were unable to compare the
levels of psychological comorbidity and impaired
quality of life we observed. Finally, these symp-
toms may be a consequence of ongoing inflamma-
tion, although there was no significant difference
seen with respect to the reported effectiveness of
drug therapy received for MC between individuals
with and without IBS-type symptoms.
Given the average age of over 60 years in our study
population, it may be that other comorbidities
have impacted on quality of life measures,
although there should be no particular reason why
these should affect the two groups of patients,
with or without IBS-type symptoms, unequally.
Furthermore, the trend towards individuals
reporting IBS-type symptoms more frequently
using PPI therapy could represent an important
confounding factor, in terms of risk of developing
MC. Colonic biopsy specimens were reviewed by
several different GI pathologists, as this study was
conducted in routine clinical practice, meaning
that interobserver variability in the diagnosis of
MC may have been introduced into the study.
However, other investigators have demonstrated
that there is little interobserver variability in the
diagnosis of MC.20 Finally, we did not collect MC
disease activity data using a validated tool, such as
the recently proposed MC disease activity index,
as this was not available when this study was
designed.31 Therefore, we cannot exclude that the
high prevalence of IBS-type symptoms observed
in this group of patients was attributable to active
MC, particularly given the fact that a diagnosis of
IBS can only be given after exclusion of known
structural causes of lower GI symptoms. This
implies that symptoms of MC in general, rather
than the fact that these are compatible with IBS,
impacts negatively on mental health and quality of
life.
Data on the impact of MC on quality of life have
been reported both in clinical trials16,17,32 and
cross-sectional surveys.14,15 Of these studies, three
used the SF-36 questionnaire in individuals with
MC and in healthy controls matched for age and
sex.14,17 Miehlke and colleagues, in two rand-
omized clinical trials, reported greater impair-
ment across all domains of the SF-36 for both LC
and CC,17 and Hjortswang and colleagues dem-
onstrated significantly lower scores across all
domains except physical functioning for individu-
als with CC.14 In terms of the impact on psycho-
logical health, we are not aware of any other
studies using the validated HADS or PHQ-15
questionnaires to examine for anxiety, depres-
sion, or somatization respectively, although
Nyhlin and colleagues included an assessment of
disease-related worry, as part of the short health
questionnaire, and identified significantly higher
levels in those with MC compared with healthy
controls.15 Furthermore, Roth and colleagues
assessed the levels of overall psychological wellbe-
ing in female patients with MC but did not com-
pare levels with healthy controls.18
The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms seen in our
study is very similar to that reported by a previous
meta-analysis,9 which included four studies,6,7,33,34
and demonstrated a pooled prevalence of 33.4%
in 420 individuals with MC. It should be noted
that in this meta-analysis, only the study by Gu
and colleagues used the Rome III criteria to define
IBS-type symptoms, as we did, but included a
smaller number of individuals with MC.33 Only
one study has attempted to assess the prevalence,
and impact, of IBS-type symptoms in MC in rela-
tion to psychological wellbeing.18 Roth and col-
leagues identified a higher prevalence of IBS-type
symptoms in MC of 55%, and demonstrated that
affected patients also reported greater impair-
ments in psychological wellbeing, but it should be
noted that this was only performed in female
patients, and the authors did not examine for the
presence of symptoms of anxiety or depression
specifically.18
Unlike in classical IBD, where faecal calprotectin
has been used to stratify individuals into those with
active or quiescent disease,13 there is no comparable
biomarker in MC. Previous cross-sectional studies
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11
10 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
have used a measure of self-reported stool frequency
in order to define active MC.14,15 Individuals desig-
nated as having active disease reported significantly
impaired quality of life compared with those in clini-
cal remission, and patients felt to be in remission
had similar quality of life scores to healthy con-
trols.14,15 However, neither of these studies exam-
ined the role of potential concurrent IBS in the
included individuals, and given that approximately
50­60% of individuals were classified as having
active disease based on stool frequency alone, some
of these may have met criteria for IBS. Interestingly,
Nyhlin and colleagues reported that even those with
MC in clinical remission were more likely to
describe ongoing symptoms of abdominal pain,
nocturnal diarrhoea, arthralgia, and myalgia despite
an improvement in bowel frequency,15 suggesting
that some individuals could either have been
wrongly classified as being in remission, or may
have had concomitant IBS-type symptoms or soma-
toform-type behaviour.
Therefore, although it is challenging to distin-
guish whether individuals with MC meeting cri-
teria for IBS have symptoms due to active MC or
true concomitant IBS-type symptoms, there
appears to be a distinct subset of individuals who
experience persistent, troublesome symptoms
more than 12 months after diagnosis and treat-
ment of MC. With this in mind, it is interesting
to note that among those who received effective
therapy for MC, although rates of IBS-type
symptoms were generally lower, mood and qual-
ity of life scores were no better than among those
who reported their therapy as being ineffective or
having made their symptoms worse. The rela-
tively low rates of patients (51%) who reported
receiving treatment for their MC in this study
probably relates to two issues. First, in the UK,
many patients over the age of 50 years with a
change in bowel habit towards looser stools are
referred for urgent colonoscopy on a suspected
lower GI cancer pathway. They usually have ran-
dom colonic biopsies taken, but if they do not
have colorectal cancer they are discharged from
follow up back to their primary care physician.
Second, it is our clinical experience that many
patients with MC who are prescribed a drug
implicated in the aetiology of the condition will
respond to withdrawal of the drug, and not need
a specific treatment for MC. Overall, this sug-
gests that even among patients with MC who
may be in clinical remission, almost one in three
will still report IBS-type symptoms, and this
impacts on psychological health and quality of
life. The aetiology of symptoms other than diar-
rhoea, such as abdominal pain, in patients with
MC is not clear but could relate to underlying
active inflammation, as well as previous low-
grade inflammation leading to altered neuromus-
cular function, as has been seen in postinfectious
IBS,35 diverticular disease,36 and even in inactive
IBD.37 It is also interesting to note that we did
not detect any association between evidence of
macroscopic inflammation at the index colonos-
copy, and presence of IBS-type symptoms.
Strategies to identify and treat the underlying
cause of these symptoms may have significant
implications for reducing healthcare-related costs
in patients with MC. Furthermore, the finding
that approximately 40% of individuals had either
borderline or abnormal levels of anxiety, and
20% had borderline or abnormal levels of depres-
sion, suggests that drugs that act on the gut­brain
axis or psychological therapies, which are benefi-
cial in functional GI disorders,38,39 may be help-
ful in this group of individuals with MC.
In summary, one third of patients with MC
reported IBS-type symptoms. Whether this is due
to ongoing inflammation is unclear, although this
was the case even among those whose symptoms
of MC had been well controlled by drug therapy.
Further research is required to determine the
relationship between MC and IBS-type symp-
toms, especially in terms of identifying methods
to distinguish symptoms of genuine IBS from
those of MC at the time of initial presentation, as
well as those related to recurrent active MC, or
potential coexistent functional GI problems,
which may require alternative treatment strate-
gies. This could include the use of scoring sys-
tems to identify patients with diarrhoea who are
more likely to have MC rather than IBS,3,4 and
who therefore need expedited colonoscopy to
obtain random colonic biopsies, disease activity
tools,31 or novel biomarkers. Furthermore,
whether MC impacts negatively on patients' lives
in other ways, as seen with the debilitating fatigue
described in the other inflammatory bowel dis-
eases,40,41 requires investigation in the future.
