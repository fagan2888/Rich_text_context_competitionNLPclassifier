Unmet Need for Personal Assistance With
Activities of Daily Living Among Older Adults
Mayur M. Desai, PhD, MPH,1 Harold R. Lentzner, PhD,1
and Julie Dawson Weeks, PhD1
Purpose: This study examined the prevalence, correlates,
and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assis-
tance with activities of daily living (ADLs) among older
adults. Design and Methods: The authors analyzed cross-
sectional data from the 1994 National Health Interview Sur-
vey's Supplement on Aging. Data were weighted to be repre-
sentative of the noninstitutionalized population aged 70 years
and older. Results: Overall, 20.7% of those needing help to
perform 1 or more ADLs (an estimated 629,000 persons) re-
ported receiving inadequate assistance; for individual ADLs,
the prevalence of unmet need ranged from 10.2% (eating) to
20.1% (transferring). The likelihood of having 1 or more un-
met needs was associated with lower household income, mul-
tiple ADL difficulties, and living alone. Nearly half of those
with unmet needs reported experiencing a negative conse-
quence (e.g., unable to eat when hungry) as a result of their
unmet need. Implications: Greater, targeted efforts are
needed to reduce the prevalence and consequences of unmet
need for ADL assistance in elderly persons.

arrangements
Many elderly persons living in the community
have difficulty performing basic activities of daily liv-
ing (ADLs), such as eating, walking, and toileting. Of-
ten, individuals are able to overcome such difficulties
through the use of assistive devices (see, e.g., Hartke,
Prohaska, & Furner, 1998; Manton, Corder, & Stal-
lard, 1993; Verbrugge, Rennert, & Madans, 1997). In
many instances, however, disabled elderly persons
need help from others (i.e., personal assistance) to per-
form ADLs (Norburn et al., 1995). If the need for as-
sistance goes unmet, older adults may be at risk for a
variety of adverse outcomes, including increased
health services utilization and depression (Allen &
Mor, 1997) as well as institutionalization (Chenier,
1997; Tennstedt, McKinlay, & Kasten, 1994). Current
estimates of need and unmet need for ADL personal
assistance may serve as an indicator of future need
for long-term care services (Tennstedt et al., 1994).
To help reduce the burden of unmet need and to
facilitate the development and targeting of in-home
and community-based services, it is important that
we determine the prevalence and correlates of unmet
need for personal assistance with ADLs. To date,
however, few population-based studies have sought
to address this issue. Analyzing data from the 1984
National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), Manton
(1989) found that, among community-dwelling older
adults with chronic disability, the prevalence of un-
met need for ADL assistance ranged from 1.4% (eat-
ing) to 27.9% (toileting). Overall, more than a third
(34.6%) of the disabled population aged 65 years
and older reported an unmet need for assistance with
one or more ADLs. Prevalence of unmet need was
strongly associated with increasing age and level of
disability.
Using different definitions of disability, need, and
unmet need, Allen and Mor (1997) conducted a tele-
phone survey of disabled adults in Springfield, Mas-
sachusetts, and found that the prevalence of unmet
need for assistance with ADLs ranged from 4.3% (eat-
ing) to 22.6% (bathing) among those aged 65 and
older. Unmet need was significantly more likely among
persons with two or fewer reliable helpers and among
those who were more severely impaired. The authors
also found that a substantial proportion of elderly
persons with unmet needs experienced serious, nega-
tive consequences as a result of receiving inadequate
personal assistance. In another study of disabled el-
derly persons (aged 70 years and older) in Massachu-
setts, Tennstedt and colleagues (1994) reported that
less than 10% of respondents had an unmet need for
assistance with personal care ADLs and that the like-
lihood of unmet need was significantly associated
with level of disability.
From a national policy and planning perspective,
these previous findings are somewhat limited insofar
The Second Supplement on Aging to the 1994 National Health Inter-
view Survey was developed and funded primarily by the National Center
for Health Statistics and the National Institute on Aging, with additional
support from the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning
and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The field
work was conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

as they are based on older data or on data from a lim-
ited geographic region. In contrast, in the present
study we used recent data from a nationally represen-
tative sample of older adults to address the following
objectives: (a) to derive estimates of need and unmet
need for ADL personal assistance; (b) to identify cor-
relates of unmet need; and (c) building on the work
of Allen and Mor (1997), to examine the prevalence
and correlates of negative consequences of unmet
need for ADL assistance.
Methods
Data Source and Analytic Sample
Data for these analyses come from the Second
Supplement on Aging (SOA II) to the 1994 National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in col-
laboration with the National Institute on Aging. Cov-
ering a broad range of health topics, the NHIS is a
household survey that is administered annually to a
multistage probability sample of the civilian, nonin-
stitutionalized population of the United States (Mas-
sey, Moore, Parsons, & Tadros, 1989). Approximately
1 year after the 1994 NHIS was conducted, house-
hold members aged 70 years and older were recon-
tacted, and 9,447 of these individuals completed the
SOA II (NCHS, 1998). Reflecting the U.S. population
aged 70 and older in 1995, the weighted SOA II sam-
ple had a mean age of 77.3 years and was 60% fe-
male and 90% White.
Trained interviewers from the U.S. Bureau of the
Census collected SOA II data through face-to-face,
in-home interviews. Assisted and proxy interviews
(6% and 11%, respectively) were allowed for elderly
persons who were unable to participate on their own
because of illness or impairment. Data were col-
lected on various aspects of health and well-being in
later life, such as sociodemographic characteristics,
living arrangements, and measures of physical health
and functioning, including ADLs.
The SOA II interview included a series of ques-
tions about seven ADLs: (a) bathing or showering; (b)
dressing; (c) eating; (d) getting in and out of bed or
chairs (i.e., transferring); (e) walking; (f) getting out-
side; and (g) using the toilet, including getting to the
toilet (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963).
For each ADL, respondents were first asked whether
or not, because of a health or physical problem, they
had any difficulty performing the activity (by them-
selves and without using special equipment). For the
purposes of this study, we defined disability as diffi-
culty performing ADLs. The prevalence of ADL dis-
ability ranged from 2.5% (eating) to 23.9% (walking).
Overall, nearly 30% of all persons aged 70 and older
reported difficulty performing one or more ADLs. Ex-
cluding individuals who reported no difficulty per-
forming ADLs (see Figure 1), we focused the analyses
of this study on older adults with ADL disabilities.
Personal Assistance With ADLs
After asking respondents whether they had diffi-
culty performing individual ADLs, interviewers asked
study participants whether or not they received assis-
tance from another person when performing a given
activity, and whether or not they needed (or needed
more) personal assistance. Personal assistance was de-
fined as either hands-on help or supervisory/standby
help. On the basis of the answers to these questions,
we categorized disabled respondents as having no
need, met need, or unmet need for personal assis-
tance with ADLs (see Figure 1). As Figure 1 illustrates,
individuals were categorized as having no need for
personal assistance with a given ADL if they reported
having difficulty performing the activity, but not re-
ceiving and not needing personal assistance. Respon-
dents were categorized as having a met need if they
reported having difficulty and receiving personal as-
sistance, but not needing more assistance. Those who
reported having difficulty and needing more personal
assistance than they were receiving, if any, were cat-
egorized as having an unmet need.
Negative Consequences of Unmet Need
For four of the seven ADLs, the SOA II interviewers
asked respondents whether or not they had experi-
enced (during the past month) any negative conse-
quences as a result of inadequate personal assistance.
For example, respondents who reported experiencing
either (a) discomfort because they were not able to
bathe as often as they would have liked or (b) a burn
or scald caused by bathing with water that was too
hot were regarded as having experienced a negative
consequence of unmet need for personal assistance
with bathing/showering. Similar sorts of questions
were asked for dressing, eating, and toileting (see Ta-
ble 1).
Respondents who reported difficulty walking were
asked how often they moved around their house/
apartment. Multiple-choice answers ranged from
"whenever [I] want" to "not often enough even to use
the bathroom." Those who reported mobility restric-
tion (i.e., something other than "whenever [I] want")
were categorized as having had a negative conse-
quence of unmet need for personal assistance with
walking. In the SOA II interview, questions regarding
negative consequences of unmet need were not
asked for the remaining two ADLs, that is, transfer-
ring and getting outside.

ities of daily living.

Potential Correlates
Sociodemographic characteristics, number of chronic
conditions, and level of ADL disability were consid-
ered as potential correlates of unmet need and nega-
tive consequences of unmet need for personal assis-
tance with ADLs. Specifically, we included the
following sociodemographic variables in the analy-
sis: sex, age (70­74, 75­79, 80­84, 85 years), race
(White, Black, or other), education (12 or 12
years), annual household income ($20,000 or
$20,000), and living arrangements (alone or not
alone).
Respondents reported whether or not they had
ever had (a) a broken hip; (b) osteoporosis; (c) diabe-
tes; (d) arthritis; (e) chronic bronchitis or emphysema;
(f) asthma; (g) hypertension; (h) heart disease (includ-
ing coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or
myocardial infarction); (i) any other heart disease; (j)
a stroke or cerebrovascular accident; or (k) cancer.
We calculated a summary score and categorized re-
spondents as having had zero to one, two to three, or
four or more chronic conditions. Level of ADL dis-
ability was defined according to the number of ADLs
an individual had difficulty performing (one to two,
three to four, or five to seven ADLs). Because assisted
and proxy interviews were allowed in SOA II data
collection, our analyses also included a variable for
respondent status (self, assisted, or proxy).
Data Analysis
Among persons with ADL difficulties, we deter-
mined the overall distribution of need (i.e., no need,
met need, or unmet need) for personal assistance
with ADLs. Then, focusing on those individuals who
reported need (either met need or unmet need) for as-
sistance, we reexamined level of unmet need. Next,
we determined the proportion of individuals who
had experienced a negative consequence as a result
of their unmet need. Finally, chi-squared and logistic
regression analyses (Agresti, 1990) were performed to
identify correlates of both unmet need and negative
consequences of unmet need for personal assistance
with one or more ADLs. The multivariate analysis em-
ployed a backward elimination strategy (Kleinbaum,
1994). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) were calculated. We performed all analyses
using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996) to
take into account the survey's complex sample de-
sign; this allowed for appropriate variance estimation
and weighting of the data.

enough to stretch and have a change of scenery now and
then, (3) often enough to take care of toileting needs but not
much more than that, or (4) not often enough even to use the
bathroom?
Toileting
1. During the past month, did you experience discomfort
because you did not have help getting to the bathroom or
changing soiled clothing as often as you needed to?
2. During the past month, did you wet or soil yourself because
you did not have help getting to the bathroom, using a bed
pan or using a commode?

Results
As the results in Table 2 show, substantial num-
bers of older adults have difficulty performing basic
activities of daily living; it is estimated that more than
6.2 million adults aged 70 and older had difficulty
performing one or more ADLs in 1995. Among those
who had difficulty performing individual ADLs, the
prevalence of unmet need for assistance ranged from
6.2% for eating to 11.7% for bathing/showering. Con-
sidering only persons with need (either met need or
unmet need) for assistance, estimates of unmet need
ranged from 10.2% for eating to 20.1% for transfer-
ring. Overall, 48.7% of older adults with ADL diffi-
culties (or an estimated 3 million persons aged 70
and older) reported needing some sort of personal as-
sistance with one or more ADLs, and, of those indi-
viduals with need, 20.7% (or an estimated 629,000
persons) had an unmet need. Nearly half (47.6%) of
respondents with an unmet need for ADL personal
assistance reported experiencing a negative conse-
quence as a result of their unmet need.
Correlates of unmet need for ADL personal assis-
tance are presented in Table 3. Prevalence of unmet
need did not significantly vary by age, race, or num-
ber of chronic conditions. After adjusting for other
sample characteristics, neither sex nor education was
independently associated with unmet need. In multi-
variate analysis, respondents whose annual house-
hold income was less than $20,000, who lived alone,
and who had difficulty performing an increasing num-
ber of ADLs were at increased risk of having an un-
met need for personal assistance. In addition, partici-
pants with a proxy respondent were less likely to
have unmet needs.
Table 4 presents correlates of negative conse-
quences of unmet need for ADL personal assistance.
The likelihood of experiencing negative consequences
of unmet need was significantly associated with lower
income and increasing level of ADL disability. None
of the other sociodemographic and health status vari-
ables considered were associated with negative con-
sequences.

Discussion
Using data from a nationally representative sample
of community-dwelling elderly persons, we found
that approximately 3 million persons aged 70 and
older needed personal assistance to perform one or
more ADLs in 1995. Overall, fully one fifth of those
needing help reported receiving inadequate assis-
tance, half of whom had recently experienced a neg-
ative consequence as a result of their unmet need.
Low-income elderly persons and those with multiple
ADL difficulties were at increased risk for both hav-
ing an unmet need and experiencing a negative con-
sequence as a result. Those who lived alone were
more than twice as likely to have unmet needs,
though no more likely to report negative conse-
quences.
It is difficult to compare estimates of unmet need
for ADL assistance across studies, because of consid-
erable differences in study methods; sample charac-
teristics; and definitions of disability, need, and un-
met need. Whether we use all persons reporting
difficulty performing a given ADL or only those need-
ing assistance as the denominator, our estimates of
unmet need differ from those previously reported
(Allen & Mor, 1997; Manton, 1989; Tennstedt et al.,
1994). For most ADLs, we found higher rates of un-
met need for assistance than either Manton (1989) or
Tennstedt and colleagues (1994). This may be ex-
plained, at least in part, by our more comprehensive
definition of unmet need: Whereas the two earlier
studies asked only respondents receiving no help at
all whether or not they needed help, we additionally
asked those receiving some help whether or not they
needed more help (similar to Allen & Mor, 1997).
Moreover, the relatively low rates of unmet need re-
ported by Tennstedt and colleagues (1994) may re-
flect the fact that their analysis focused on a select
subsample of study participants who were still alive
and community-dwelling 2 years following baseline
interview. The higher rates of unmet need reported
by Allen and Mor (1997) may, in part, be attributed
to their assessment of need in the past month (1-

month period prevalence) as opposed to need at the
present time (point prevalence).
Consistent with other studies (Allen & Mor, 1997;
Manton, 1989; Tennstedt et al., 1994), on the other
hand, was the finding that level of ADL disability (de-
fined as the number of ADLs an individual had diffi-
culty performing) was the strongest predictor of un-
met need. The positive association between severity
of disability and prevalence of unmet need for assis-
tance likely reflects the fact that elderly persons with
more ADL difficulties require more personal care,
thereby increasing the likelihood that caregivers will
not be able to satisfy all needs. The importance of the
observed association between level of ADL disability
and prevalence of unmet need is underscored by
findings that increased disability and caregiver bur-
den often precipitate the transition from community
living to institutionalization (Chenier, 1997).
In this study, we also found that disabled elderly
persons whose annual household income was less than
$20,000 were more likely to report receiving inade-
quate personal assistance with ADLs. Although Tenn-
stedt and colleagues (1994) did not find an associa-
tion between income and unmet need, Allen and
Mor (1997) reported that the number of routine ex-
penses one could not afford (a proxy for income) was
positively associated with the number of unmet ADL
needs (OR  1.14, 95% CI  0.99-1.30). Similarly,
in a study of cancer outpatients (Siegel, Raveis,
Houts, & Mor, 1991), unmet needs were significantly
more likely among those eligible for Medicaid or
public assistance. In these data, we did not find an
association between insurance status and unmet
need. More than 95% of the sample had Medicare; in
addition, 21% had Medicaid and 64% had private in-
surance. Prevalence of unmet need for personal as-
sistance with one or more ADLs did not differ ac-
cording to presence or absence of Medicaid (21.2%
vs. 20.6%, respectively, p  .84) or presence or ab-
sence of private insurance (19.8% vs. 23.0%, respec-
tively, p  .23). These data suggest that elderly per-
sons living in lower income households are less
likely to be able to pay for formal care when the level
of informal caregiving is insufficient. There is longitu-
dinal evidence that increased access to formal in-home
services may contribute to continued community liv-
ing among disabled elderly persons (Tennstedt, Craw-
ford, & McKinlay, 1993b).
Older adults with multiple ADL difficulties and
limited financial resources were at increased risk for
not only having unmet needs but also experiencing
negative consequences of unmet needs. It is of great
concern that nearly half of those with unmet needs
experienced one or more negative consequences, be-
cause many of the negative consequences (such as
not being able to eat when hungry and experiencing
a burn or scald when bathing) had the potential to se-
riously threaten the health and safety of those with
unmet needs.
Our finding that older adults who lived alone were
twice as likely as those who lived with others to re-
port an unmet need for personal assistance is con-
sistent with an extensive body of literature on in-
strumental social support (e.g., Langford, Bowsher,
Maloney, & Lillis, 1997) and informal caregiving
(e.g., Robinson, 1997). As expected, in the majority
of cases, a disabled respondent's spouse or child was
the primary caregiver. A more detailed analysis of
household composition, marital status, and availabil-
ity of children supported the findings of Chappell
(1991) and Tennstedt, Crawford, and McKinlay
(1993a) that coresidence is often more important
than kinship tie per se in determining patterns of in-
formal care and use of formal services. The fact that
those who live alone are especially vulnerable to
having unmet needs is important in light of the fact
that, over time, an increasing proportion of the old-
est-old, particularly women, are living alone (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1996).
We also found that participants with a proxy re-
spondent were less likely to have unmet needs. Al-
though we believe this likely reflects the fact that
those with an available proxy are more likely to need
and, indeed, receive personal assistance with ADLs,
the association may stem from proxies' greater un-
willingness to report unmet need, fearing that doing
so would negatively reflect on their own caregiving
adequacy. To the extent that the latter is true, unmet
need for ADL personal assistance would be underes-
timated. Notably, the same correlates of unmet need
and negative consequences of unmet need were
found when we restricted the sample to self-respon-
dents only.
Although the majority of older adults who have
difficulty performing basic ADLs have either no need
or met need for personal assistance, a substantial pro-
portion of disabled elderly persons continue to have
unmet needs and experience negative consequences
as a result. Most of the assistance that a community-
dwelling elderly person receives is provided infor-
mally by family caregivers; in some instances, this
care is supplemented by formal services. Because in-
dividuals whose needs for assistance go unmet may
be at risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, it is im-
portant that the likelihood of having unmet needs be
minimized. Greater, targeted efforts are needed to
identify at-risk older persons living in the community
and to provide services (e.g., home care, community-
based services, assistive devices, and residential mod-
ifications) that may reduce the burden of unmet
need. In the present study, we identified broad socio-
demographic and health status factors associated
with unmet need and negative consequences of un-
met need for ADL personal assistance. Further studies
are needed to identify and overcome specific barriers
to receiving help and services (e.g., inability to pay
and lack of accessibility or availability in one's area).
Future work should consider the effectiveness of tar-
geting potentially vulnerable populations, such as
older adults living in low-income housing or poor ru-
ral communities.
Follow-up data are currently being collected on
SOA II respondents. In future studies, we will be able
to examine the longitudinal effects of having unmet

needs for ADL personal assistance in terms of out-
comes such as functional decline, medical visits,
hospitalizations, institutionalization, and mortality.
