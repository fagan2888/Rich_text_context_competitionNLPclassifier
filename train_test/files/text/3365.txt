Introduction
Share buyback, also known as share repurchase, refers to the
action of a firm to reacquire its shares from the open market
thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares. Share
buyback activities have grown dramatically in the last 30
years, and it has become an increasingly important event not
just in the United States or Europe, but also inAsia. The most
common reason for share buyback is "undervaluation" of the
company's shares (Ikenberry, Lakonishok, & Vermaelen,
1995) and as a more flexible payout mechanism compared
with dividends (Jagannathan, Stephens, & Weisbach, 2000).
The history of share buyback in Asian markets started in the
early 1990s in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and
Taiwan. In 1991, Hong Kong legalized share buyback
through the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 1991 (Firth
& Yueng, 2005) followed by Japan and Korea in 1994
(Hackethal & Zdantchouk, 2006).
In the United States, the volume and value of buyback
program announcements grew from 115 (US$15.4 billion) in
1985 to 755 (US$115 billion) in 1996, at a rate of 23% per
year (Jagannathan et al., 2000).Around 80% of the announced
programs were carried out in the open market and the actual
buyback increased from US$8.8 billion in 1985 to US$63
billion in 1996. In Malaysia, the buyback program was intro-
duced during the financial crisis to boost the market, which
is in contrast to the share buyback activity in the United
States. Share buyback has reduced significantly during the
recession in 2008 with a buyback value of US$339.6 billion
as compared with US$589.1 billion in 2007, a reduction of
42.3% (Amenta, 2013; Taub, 2009). Due to the uncertainty
of future cash flow, many firms chose to conserve capital by
pulling back on expenditures including share buyback.
Share buyback has long been authorized in developed
markets such as in the United States and Europe. Research
has shown that buyback announcements have positive effects
on the price returns (Dann, 1981; Ikenberry, Lakonishok, &
Vermaelen, 2000; Masulis, 1980; Park & Jung, 2005). In the
local market, studies by Jais and Chin (2001) and Lim and
Bacha (2002) are consistent with the findings of more devel-
oped markets. Abnormal returns are also found in the studies
of actual buyback programs in overseas markets and also in
Malaysia (Isa, Ghani, & Lee, 2011; Vermaelen, 1981; Wong,
Lim, & Chong, 2011; Zhang, 2005).
In Malaysia, share buyback was permitted in 1997 in the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), currently known as

Impact of Open-Market Share
Repurchases on Long-Term Stock
Returns: Evidence From the Malaysian
Market
Mohamed Albaity1 and Diana Syafiza Said2
Abstract
After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, firms listed on Bursa Malaysia were allowed to repurchase their shares on the open
market. The number of companies engaged in share buyback is increasing and has become a tool to stabilize price by signaling
undervaluation of the share. However, studies on share buyback in Malaysia are limited to the price performance surrounding
the buyback events. This study aims to fill this gap by examining long-run price performance after the actual share buyback
event over a sampling period of 2 years from 2009 to 2010 for Malaysian firms listed on FTSE Bursa Malaysia. There is no
evidence to conclude that there exist long-term abnormal returns using the calendar-time portfolio approach that support
the inefficient market hypothesis. On the contrary, buy-and-hold method was found to be significant supporting that the
Malaysian stock market is semi-strong efficient.

Bursa Malaysia Securities (Bursa), due to the depressed capi-
tal market during theAsian financial crisis. Many stocks expe-
rienced price declines with the Kuala Lumpur Composite
Index plunging from 1012.84 points in July 1997 to 477.57 in
January 1998. Companies are allowed to repurchase their
underpriced shares to shore up the share prices, hence helping
to stabilize the weakening market. By buying back their
shares, the company can reduce the supply of the floating
shares outstanding so that the share price will be supported or
even increase eventually.
However in Malaysia, the previous findings are only lim-
ited to the price impacts surrounding the share buyback events
(Isa et al., 2011; Jais & Chin, 2001; Lim & Bacha, 2002;
Shahar &Abdullah, 2007; Wong et al., 2011). The effect of the
long-run price performance after the actual buyback has not
received adequate attention using Malaysian data. Few studies
looked at the impact of share buyback on performance and
indicated that the initial market reaction to the open-market
share buyback announcement is incomplete (Ikenberry et al.,
1995, 2000; Jagannathan & Stephens, 2003; Latif & Mohd,
2013). This suggests that the economic benefits may not be
completely realized immediately, and long-term drifts of
abnormal returns following the announcement exist. This is
also supported by Lakonishok and Vermaelan (1990) who
found that the abnormal returns remained after 2 years of buy-
back execution through fixed-priced tender offers repurchase.
Other documented empirical evidence of delayed market reac-
tions to other types of events exists in the form of initial public
offerings (IPOs; Ritter, 1991), mergers (Agrawal, Jaffe, &
Mandelker, 1992), proxy contests (Ikenberry & Lakonishok,
1993), spinoffs (Cusatis, Miles, & Woolridge, 1993), and sea-
soned equity offerings (Loughran & Ritter, 1995).
Ikenberry et al. (1995) discovered that the long-run abnor-
mal returns following the repurchase execution are superior in
the high book-to-market (BTM) firms, which is 45.3% above
the control benchmark, unlike the market reaction to repur-
chase announcement which is similar across all BTM group.
Zhang (2005) indicated that the price performance after the
actual buyback varies with a clear and regular pattern across
the BTM and firm size groups. This is consistent with a local
study by Wong et al. (2011) using Malaysian data. There is
increased participation by small size firms in buyback activities
in Malaysia because the managers want to signal information
to shareholders and media about the potential of their firms
(Ramakrishnan, Ravindran, & Ganesan, 2007). This happens
because there is a wider information asymmetry in smaller
firms which results in them delivering superior price perfor-
mance in share buyback programs compared with bigger firms.
Therefore, the long-run share price performance follow-
ing a buyback event in Malaysia on the firm size and BTM
ratio should be examined to determine the sustainability of
the share price post-buyback based on these factors.
This research extends the existing studies by assessing
those factors affecting the long-term price performance fol-
lowing the share buyback. It also investigates the existence
of long-term abnormal returns following the buyback events
to determine the effectiveness of buyback as a tool to increase
and maintain share prices in the long-horizon and to con-
clude whether share buyback can be part of long-term invest-
ment strategy. The research investigates the long-run price
performance of buyback firms compared with the benchmark
following the actual buyback programs. It then investigates
the effect of BTM ratio on the long-run price performance
subsequent to the buyback event. Third, it investigates the
effect of market capitalization on the long-run price perfor-
mance after the buyback event.
This study also attempts to test the relevance of hypothe-
sized factors that affect the long-term returns after share buy-
back. Many studies found that small and value firms deliver
superior long-run abnormal returns following the actual buy-
back (Ikenberry et al., 1995; Wong et al., 2011; Zhang, 2005).
Therefore, this study will look into the relationships between
the market capitalization and BTM ratio with the long-term
returns subsequent to buyback.
Literature Review
An early study of the long-term share price behavior follow-
ing the tender offer repurchases by Lakonishok and
Vermaelan (1990) showed that the repurchasing firms earn
significant positive abnormal returns over 22 months after
the expiration of the offer. Using data from 1962 to 1986,
they found that the positive return is largely contributed by
the small firms who experience a significant decline in share
prices prior to the repurchase. Large firms, however, behave
differently in which they experience positive abnormal
returns prior to the repurchase and zero abnormal returns
post-repurchase. This suggests that tender offer share buy-
back by large firms may be motivated by corporate restruc-
turing activities rather than undervaluation.
Ikenberry et al. (1995) reported the same results for the
open-market buyback program in the U.S. market from 1980
to 1990. By using a buy-and-hold strategy, the abnormal
return over a 4-year period outperforms the market index by
12%. The results also reported that firms with high BTM
ratio earned 4-year abnormal performance of 45.3% with
respect to a controlled benchmark and concluded that under-
valuation motivates these firms to carry out buyback. Firms
in the lowest bottom two of BTM quintiles exhibit abnormal
returns close to 0 or slightly negative, implying that true
undervaluation was not the primary motive.
Further study done by Ikenberry et al. (2000) on the long-
term performance of open-market stock repurchases in
Canada found that the abnormal return over a 3-year holding
period is about 7% per year. Using a sample from 1989 to
1997, they also found that high BTM firms experienced
higher post-announcement returns compared with low BTM
firms and suggests that better long-term performance is
anticipated from repurchase motivated more by undervalua-
tion than other motives.
Albaity and Said 3
M. L. Mitchell and Stafford (2000) found evidence that is
consistent with Ikenberry et al. (1995) by utilizing the buy-
and-hold returns approach in the U.S. market. The abnormal
return over a 3-year period is 14.5%. However, their esti-
mates using the calendar-time portfolio approach produced
no evidence of long-term abnormal performance.
Grullon and Michaely (2004) found positive long-term
price performance in their study of the actual repurchase.
Studying U.S. market using data from 1980 to 1997, they
found that 3-year post-announcement abnormal return is
positively related to the current and future profitability while
inversely related to the cost of capital.
Chan, Ikenberry, and Lee (2004) found in the U.S. open-
market repurchase program that the long-term result sug-
gests the market does not fully incorporate the information
during the announcement of the buyback. They reported that
by controlling both size and BTM effects, the abnormal
return over a 4-year period is 23.56%. Chan, Ikenberry, and
Lee (2007) extended their previous study by reexamining the
long-run abnormal returns after the open-market repurchase
announcements. Using both the buy-and-hold strategy and
the calendar-time portfolio approach, they established robust
and significant evidence of positive long-term share price
return. They concluded that managers possess the timing
ability and that the pseudo-market timing only drives a small
portion of the return buyback drifts.
Yook (2010) further stratified the firms in the U.S. market
into firms with actual repurchase and without actual repur-
chase after the announcement. Firms with actual repurchase
experience significant returns over a 3-year period, whereas
the firms without actual repurchase experience negative
returns, although not significant. The actual repurchase firms
are then further broken down into frequent and infrequent
repurchasers. The results showed that infrequent repurchas-
ers earn superior returns than frequent repurchasers.
Hong Kong and Japan are two of the very few Asian
countries listed in the developed market defined by all five
major financial services firms. Zhang (2005) studied the
price performance subsequent to share repurchase of firms
listed in Stock Exchange of Hong Kong from 1993 to 1997.
The study found that the 3-year buy-and-hold abnormal
return (BHAR), which is benchmarked against a portfolio of
control firms, is up to 20%. The study concluded that over a
long-horizon, there is strong evidence that the value-firm
managers are capable of delivering superior performance to
long-term shareholders.
Unlike in the United States, share repurchase was allowed
in European countries at a much period due to many concerns
such as creditor protection, price manipulation, unequal
treatment of shareholders, and insider trading by the firms
(Rasbrant, 2011). Sweden was the last country in the European
Union to permit share buyback in March 2000. Similar to
Hong Kong and most Asian countries, firms in Sweden are
obliged to disclose their repurchase activities on a daily basis,
and they are also required to obtain shareholders' approval to
authorize the repurchase programs. These are as opposed to
the quarterly disclosure in the U.S. market and direct authori-
zations by the Board of Directors for the share repurchase
programs. The daily disclosure rules may have an impact on
the share price as they allow market participants to be notified
of any buyback activities and related updates more frequently
on a daily basis. Another interesting factor to note about share
repurchase in Sweden is that the repurchase volume on the
repurchase days is quite large, thus leading to a price support
on the repurchase days. On average, the repurchase volume
stands at 31% (median 22%) of the total outstanding shares of
the firm on the repurchase days. Using data from Stockholm
Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2009, Rasbrant (2011) found
6% to 7% positive abnormal performance in 12 months fol-
lowing the initiation announcement, and this is positively
related to the portion of shares bought back in the program.
Based on the results described above, it is evident that the
studies in the developed markets, especially in the United
States where share buyback programs first started in the
1960s, strongly support the existence of long-horizon posi-
tive drifts in stock prices for over 3 to 4 years post-announce-
ment and post-repurchase of both the tender offers and
open-market share buyback programs.
According to Technical Committee of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO; 2004),
Asian countries are bound to more stringent regulations
compared with the United States in which firms in these
countries must get approval from their shareholders before
executing buyback activities. Taiwan, for instance, requires
firms that announce buybacks programs to buy back all the
intended shares within 2 months, and failing to do so, a letter
explaining the cause of failure must be produced to the
Financial Supervisory Commission. In Malaysia and
Singapore, the number of shares bought back by the firms is
limited to 10% of the outstanding shares, as opposed to the
unlimited number of shares that can be bought back in the
United States. In most Asian countries, the daily disclosure
of open-market repurchase is mandatory whereas it is only a
discretionary in the United States. Taken together, these
stricter terms could have a different impact on the long-term
price performance subsequent to share buyback in Asian
countries.
Lee, Jung, and Thornton (2005) conducted a study in the
Korean market from 1994 to 2000. The Korean market is
unique in such a way that the repurchase program must be
completed within 3 months after the announcement, begin-
ning 3 days after the decision to repurchase by the Board of
Directors, unlike the share repurchase program in the United
States where repurchases continue for 3 years or more after
commencement (Stephens & Weisbach, 1998) or at least 1
year in other countries. Their study is aimed to eliminate the
confounding effects of ongoing repurchases that could influ-
ence the long-term price performance post-repurchase and
also the lagged price response due to repurchase announce-
ment. Another feature of the Korean market is the stringent
4 SAGE Open
disclosure requirements that are mandatory for the repur-
chasing firms. A repurchasing firm is required to submit
reports for both planned and completed stock repurchase via
Stock Repurchase Plan and Stock Repurchase Completion
Report, respectively. The firm also has to state the reason if
the repurchase of targeted stock is incomplete. The price per-
formance results then show evidence of positive abnormal
performance in the 3-month period but no evidence of abnor-
mal performance in the post-repurchase 3-year period, thus
supporting the efficient market hypothesis.
Even though regulation in Korea is in essence similar to
that in Taiwan (e.g., the disclosure of the stock repurchase
plan, the intended percentage of shares to be repurchased,
and the execution period), a study by Wang, Lin, Fung, and
Chen (2013) showed an interesting result. Using data in
Taiwan from 2000 to 2010, they found that the cumulative
abnormal daily returns for 6 days surrounding the announce-
ment period is 2.7% whereas the 3-year BHAR is 38.8%
and 19.67% by using the calendar-time portfolio approach,
thus ruling out the conclusion by Lee et al. (2005) that strict
regulation is the key factor in resolving investor skepti-
cism. This finding, however, conflicts with Su and Lin
(2012), which stated that there is no evidence that the
repurchasing firms experience positive and significant
long-term abnormal return relative to the matching firms
when using the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and
buy-and-hold strategy. By using the calendar-time portfolio
approach, Su and Lin (2012) also found significantly nega-
tive return drifts over 12, 24, and 36 months, implying that
the repurchased stocks underperformed in the post-repur-
chase period.
Studies of share buyback are limited in Malaysia. Jais and
Chin (2001) investigated 34 announced companies in 1997 to
1998 and reported that announced and implemented buyback
firms earned a significant abnormal return of 3.75% over a
2-day period whereas the announced but not implemented
firms earn a statistically insignificant 1.23%. Lim and Bacha
(2002) extended the study using data from 1997 to 2001 with
131 announced companies and reported that announced and
implemented buyback firms earned a significant abnormal
return of 2.97% over a 3-day period whereas the announced
but not implemented firms earn a statistically insignificant
0.01%. Shahar and Abdullah (2007), however, found no
abnormal returns experienced by the actual 26 buyback firms
for the tender offer share repurchase. Isa et al. (2011) found
that, on average, firms earn a CAR of 1.25% over 20 trading
days subsequent to the actual buyback. They also reported
that there is a general price decline prior to the actual buyback
day, suggesting that managers tend to time their repurchase
after several days of successive price drops. Wong et al.
(2011) also reported a significant positive return of 0.53%
over 20 trading days subsequent to the actual buyback. They
also found that the abnormal return is affected by the firm size
and BTM ratio.Arecent study done by Latif and Mohd (2013)
to investigate the signaling and substitution hypotheses in
Malaysian firms found that the signaling hypothesis was sup-
ported but not the substitution hypothesis.
The study of motivations that drive the implementation of
buyback in Malaysia has been conducted by Zainudin and
Regupathi (2003) who stated that most of the reasons for
buyback are to stabilize share price, pay stock dividend, and
as investment and increase earnings per share. The signaling
hypothesis, however, is not mentioned in the study.
Ramakrishnan et al. (2007) complemented this by conclud-
ing that managers used share buyback as an effective infor-
mation signaling tool to the investors.
These are empirical studies of share price performance
surrounding the buyback events. No study of long-term price
performance following a repurchase has been documented in
Malaysia.
Method
A research framework has been developed based on a review
of literature to determine whether share repurchase can be
used to increase the share price in the long run and, therefore,
be used as a long-term investment tool.
This study covers open-market share buyback programs
for all 865 Malaysian firms listed on the Main Market of
Bursa Malaysia from 2006 to 2010. Based on a related local
study by Isa et al. (2011), the financial crisis period should be
excluded from the sample as it may clutter the results. Similar
studies in the U.S. market also exclude the financial crisis
periods, for example, in 1987 and 1997 as they want to avoid
having unusual repurchases dominating their studies (Chan
et al., 2007; Grullon & Michaely, 2004; Ikenberry et al.,
1995; Stephens & Weisbach, 1998; Zhang, 2005). According
to Gurcharan, Wong, and Folk (2010), the global financial
crisis that started with the U.S. sub-prime mortgage in 2007
and 2008 led to serious financial challenges globally, includ-
ing in Malaysia. Therefore, open-market share buyback pro-
grams for all 865 Malaysian firms from 2009 to 2010 are
considered in this study.
Firms that are not engaged in share buyback programs are
excluded from the subsequent study, leaving only a total of
216 firms taken into consideration. Out of this number, 26
firms have been delisted or involved in major restructuring,
stock split, and dividend distribution within the study period.
Seven firms in utility and financial services sectors are also
excluded from the sample as these firms have different regu-
latory settings and are imposed with various requirements
that may influence the profitability (Latif & Mohd, 2013;
Lee et al., 2005). Twenty firms with incomplete daily prices
and financial information are also not included in the
sample.
Based on a study by Isa et al. (2011), daily transaction size
in Malaysia is typically very small, with 98% being below
0.5% of the total outstanding shares. The sporadic pattern of
buyback implementation could be due to the managers being
cautious in their repurchase strategies and does not project
Albaity and Said 5
management confidence to suggest the undervaluation of the
shares. To ensure that repurchase implementation presents a
measurable impact financially, only firms that have bought
back cumulatively 0.5% of their outstanding shares within
the sampling period are included in the final sample. Finally,
a total of 221 share buyback events is recorded for the 132
firms studied during the period. Table 1 below shows the
sampling criteria followed to reach the final sample.
Data such as daily share prices, BTM ratio, and market
capitalization for the firms listed on the Main Market of
Bursa Malaysia from January 2009 until December 2013 are
extracted out from Bloomberg terminal service and exported
to Microsoft Excel for further analysis. This includes the
yield of Malaysian Treasury Bill and the daily prices of
FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI), FTSE
Bursa Malaysia (FBM) Small Cap, Morgan Stanley
Composite Index (MSCI) Malaysia Value, and MSCI
Malaysia Growth indices for the market return and factors.
The information on share buyback dates, volumes, and
values are obtained from Bursa Malaysia's website and
Bloomberg terminal.
Similar studies in the emerging and developed markets
define a 3-year period as an appropriate measure for long-
term performance (Grullon & Michaely, 2002; Ikenberry
et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2005; M. L. Mitchell & Stafford,
2000; Wang et al., 2013; Zhang, 2005). In this study, the
abnormal return for a multiple event window periods subse-
quent to the actual share buyback is the dependent variable.
The independent variables include the BTM ratio of the
firm, which is taken from the nearest announced value prior
to the actual buyback event and the market capitalization of
the firm on the actual buyback event.
The hypotheses examined in this study will be tested
using the standard event study methodology popularized by
Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969) in capturing the price
reaction to new information. This model was later used by
Zhang (2005) and Hackethal and Zdantchouk (2006) to mea-
sure the abnormal returns surrounding the buyback events.
Based on the literature and research objectives, the study's
hypotheses are formulated.
Lakonishok and Vermaelan (1990) reported a significant
positive abnormal buy-and-hold return over 22 months after
the expiration of the offer. The same results are also reported
by Ikenberry et al. (1995) for the open-market buyback pro-
gram. By using the same strategy, the abnormal return over a
4-year period outperforms the market index by 12%. This
result is evidence not only in a developed market but also in
the emerging market (Wang et al., 2013).
In contrast to the short-run method, "the analysis of long-
run abnormal returns is treacherous" (Lyon, Barber, & Tsai,
1999). The reality of price over-reaction and under-reaction
subsequent to an event seems to point to market efficiency.
However, Fama (1998) pointed out that long-run return
anomalies, regardless of under-reaction or over-reaction, are
chance results and, hence, consistent with the efficient mar-
ket hypothesis. The long-run return anomalies will disappear
if reasonable methods are used. Most previous studies that
reported positive long-run abnormal returns use the BHAR
method (Chan et al., 2004, 2007; Ikenberry et al., 1995,
2000; Lakonishok & Vermaelan, 1990; Zhang, 2005). Barber
and Lyon (1997) and MacKinlay (1997) proposed the BHAR
method over the CAR, as CAR will produce significant
biases as a result of a new listing, rebalancing, and skewness.
They also claimed that BHAR is the appropriate measure
because it reflects the investor experience.
Fama (1998) argued against the BHAR method as it suf-
fers from cross-correlation and bad model problems. He sug-
gested a monthly calendar-time portfolio abnormal return
(CTIME) approach as a substitute. This approach was first
used by Jaffe (1974) and Mandelker (1974) by tracking the
performance of event-firms' portfolio in calendar-time rela-
tive to either an explicit asset pricing model or a benchmark.
Lyon et al. (1999) then extended their prior study by com-
paring BHAR and CTIME, and concluded that both methods
have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of
BHAR is that it yields an abnormal return that mirrors the
investor experience whereas the disadvantage of this
approach is its high sensitivity toward the problem of cross-
sectional dependence among sample firms and a poorly spec-
ified asset pricing model. Meanwhile, the advantage of
CTIME is that it can handle the cross-correlation problem
and is less sensitive to the poorly specified asset pricing
model. However, CTIME yields an abnormal return that
does not accurately measure the investor experience.
M. L. Mitchell and Stafford (2000) also compared the
reliability of BHAR and CTIME approaches using mergers,
seasoned equity offerings, and share repurchases. They
found that unlike CTIME, BHAR is not an adequate method-
ology as it assumes independence of multiyear event-firm
abnormal returns.
This study seeks to minimize the confounding effect due
to multiple repurchase programs by a firm within the study
window. The confounding effect will contaminate the clean
estimation of price performance subsequent to the first repur-
chase if the firm announces or carry out another new repur-
chase programs within the estimation period of the first
repurchase. The new announcements or actual repurchases
would produce the noise effect that is incorporated in the

evaluation of returns of the first repurchase. Therefore, this
study used both methods carried out by M. L. Mitchell and
Stafford (2000) in using CTIME and also the standard
method, BHAR approaches, to estimate the abnormal return.
For the BHAR method, the difference of a sample firm's
daily compounded returns and the benchmark daily com-
pounded returns are calculated for three window periods, 1
year (0, 1), 2 year (0, 2), and 3 year (0, 3) following the
actual repurchase day (Zhang, 2005). The BHAR of firm i
and event date t is defined as follows:

where BHAR

is the buy-and-hold return of buyback

calculation of long-term abnormal return can be very sensi-
tive to the selection of benchmark (Barber & Lyon, 1997;
Gray & Whittaker, 2003; Kothari & Warner, 1997). Gray and
Whittaker (2003) proposed a matched-firm benchmark based
on size and industry, for it has lower levels of bias as mea-
sured by mean squared error (MSE). However, in this study,
index benchmark is used based on the firm size. FTSE Bursa
Malaysia Small Cap Index (FBMSC) is used as a benchmark
for firms with a market capitalization of RM1,300 Mil and
below, FTSE Bursa Malaysia Mid 70 Index (FBM70) for
firms between RM1,301 Mil and RM10,000 Mil, and
FBMKLCI for firms with size above RM10,000 Mil.
The statistical test of BHAR is based on the equal-weight
cross-average which is calculated as follows:

By using this alternative approach, an equal-weight portfolio
of firms is constructed consisting of all firms that have
implemented buyback programs within the previous 36
months, supposed a 3-year period of abnormal returns are to
be analyzed. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly to include
firm that has just executed a transaction and also to exclude
firms that reach the end of their 36-month period. The
monthly abnormal return earned by this portfolio is defined
as the portfolio's excess return. As opposed to the BHAR
method in which the abnormal return is calculated from each
of the event-firms, the excess returns from the CTIME
method are regressed on the three Fama­French (Fama &
French, 1993) factors as these are the monthly portfolio
returns of the event-firm.

where R

is the monthly
market return in month t; SMB

is the average return on small
market capitalization portfolio minus the average return on
large market capitalization portfolio; HML
t
is the average
monthly return on high BTM equity portfolios minus the aver-
age monthly return on low BTM equity portfolios (refer to
Fama and French, 1993, for a detailed description of SMB
t
and HML
t
). The ordinary least square regression is estimated
on portfolio returns. The intercept, alpha, is the measure of the
average monthly abnormal return on portfolios of buyback
firms (Latif, Mohd, Hussin, & Ismail, 2013; Yook, 2010).
In the work of Fama and French (1993), the factors of
SMB and HML are self-constructed. However, in this study,
market portfolios that are readily available in the market are
utilized to represent the SMB and HML factors. In Malaysia,
Abdullah, Hassan, Redzuan, Muhammad, and Abdullah
(2013) used market indices as a proxy for those factors. The
return differential between FBMSC (a proxy for small capi-
talization portfolios) and FBMKLCI (a proxy for large capi-
talization portfolios) is used as the SMB factor. For the HML
factor, this study uses the return differential between MSCI
Malaysia Value Index (a proxy for high BTM ratio portfo-
lios) and MSCI Malaysia Growth Index (a proxy for low
BTM ratio portfolios).
Based on Yook (2010) and Su and Lin (2012), the event
windows are defined as from Month 0 to Month 12 (0, 12),
from Month 0 to Month 24 (0, 24), and from Month 0 to
Month 36 (0, 36) in which Month 0 is the month of actual
share repurchase.
In reference to the findings that use CTIME as a method of
calculation (Lee et al., 2005; M. L. Mitchell & Stafford, 2000;
Su & Lin, 2012;Yook, 2010), this study suggests that the firms
involved in the actual share repurchase program will earn a
very small insignificantly positive or significantly negative
long-term abnormal return. Using those different methods, the
first hypothesis that the study is proposing is as follows:
Hypothesis 1: There are positive long-term abnormal
returns of the repurchasing firm as compared with the
specified benchmark.
The BTM ratio has also been identified as another important
factor by local and overseas researchers in determining the
share price performance following share buyback programs
(Chan et al., 2004; Ikenberry et al., 1995; Vermaelen, 1981;
Wong et al., 2011; Zhang, 2005). By using buy-and-hold
returns over 4 years, Chan et al. (2004) found that high BTM
companies have larger returns over their matched sample
which is 28.35% compared with 22.92% for low BTM compa-
nies. Firms with high BTM, or "value stocks," were also proven
by Hackethal and Zdantchouk (2006) to have outperformed the
"glamour stocks" or firms with low BTM by 45%.
Hypothesis 2: Firms with high BTM ratio experience
higher long-term abnormal returns compared with firms
with low BTM ratio.

Market capitalization has been identified as an important
factor by local and overseas researchers in determining the
share price performance following share buyback programs
(Chan et al., 2004; Ikenberry et al., 1995; Vermaelen, 1981;
Wong et al., 2011; Zhang, 2005). These studies including
Ramakrishnan et al. (2007) found that information asym-
metry which has caused greater undervaluation and mispric-
ing is larger in small firms due to less public disclosure and
focus by the analysts as compared with bigger firms. Zhang
(2005) concluded that smaller firms have higher abnormal
returns, which are 0.95% in the immediate response and
2.78% in 20 trading days after the event as compared with
-0.134% and -1.549% for larger firms.
Hypothesis 3: Smaller firms experience higher long-term
abnormal returns compared with bigger firms.
Based on findings that use BHAR as a method of
calculation(s), this study suggests that the firms involved in
the actual share repurchase program will earn positive and
significant long-term abnormal returns.
Finally, the information on the firms' share prices, event
dates, and return model are consolidated and processed in
Event Study Metric software to calculate the abnormal
returns and to obtain the statistical analysis.
Results and Discussion
The final sample consists of 221 open-market share buyback
events carried out by 132 firms listed on the Main Market of
Bursa Malaysia within the study window.
Table 2 shows the share buyback activities recorded for
all the 132 sample firms from January 2009 to December
2010. One hundred thirty-two participating firms reported a
total of 221 events of share buyback in the entire study
period. Panel A in Table 2 shows the different repurchase
events done by those firms. Half of the firms have a repur-
chase event within 25 days whereas the rest have more than
25 days.
Panel B shows the increase in dollar value of the shares
repurchased accordingly. Panel C illustrates that the number
of shares repurchased increased from 2009 to 2010, even

though the number of events recorded decreased. This may
be due to the increase in the volume of repurchases in one
execution. Many firms may be changing strategy by buying
back their shares in large amounts per transaction to gain
measurable price support. This is supported by the figures in
Panel D in which the mean and median of the percentage of
shares repurchased based on the outstanding shares are also
increasing.
This table also shows that there is a greater difference
between the median and the mean for Panels B and C. The
median that is less than the mean indicates that the distribu-
tions are positively skewed and the greater difference
between those values shows that there are several firms in
the sample that carried out considerably higher volume and
dollar value of share repurchase than the rest of the firms in
the sample. Panel E also shows positively skewed distribu-
tions for the market capitalization and BTM ratio of the sam-
ple firms. However, there is a greater difference between the
median and mean of the market capitalization, and this indi-
cates that the sample contains more small size firms whereas
based on the BTM ratio, the sample is practically normal.
Abnormal returns are computed using BHAR and CTIME
over three time periods: 1 year (0, 1), 2 years (0, 2), and 3
years (0, 3) as mentioned in the "Method" section. The
results for BHAR and CTIME are shown in Tables 3 to 9.
The full sample of 221 events is analyzed for 132 firms
involved in share buyback for the years 2009 and 2010. The
daily BHAR for each event is calculated relative to the speci-
fied market index for the whole sample period of 780 trading
days (for a 3-year period) by using Equation 2. The daily
BHARs for all the events are then averaged to get the daily
average buy-and-hold abnormal return (ABHAR) using the
formula below:
ABHAR BHAR

Table 3 shows the long-term price performance for the
full sample event-firms calculated using BHAR method for
different time periods. This result is consistent with Zhang
(2005), Ikenberry et al. (1995), and Chan et al. (2007). It
means returns are not significantly different from 0 at the
nominal 5% significance level when looking at the p values
and t values. We can conclude that the first year abnormal
return is only significant at 21% significance level whereas
the second year abnormal return is significant at the 22%
level. Overall, this result does not support the under-reaction
hypothesis, even though the market is seen as adjusting
slowly from the first year to the subsequent years and the
long-term performance is positive.
Following Fama and French (1992), many studies reported
that BTM ratio and firm size significantly influence cross-
sectional stock returns and the subsequent market perfor-
mance. It is evident that small firms with high BTM ratio are
the main contributors to the positive market performance sub-
sequent to buyback events (Chan et al., 2004; Ikenberry et al.,
1995; Vermaelen, 1981; Wong et al., 2011; Zhang, 2005).

The sample is then divided into three portfolios, each con-
taining 73 to 74 firms according to the BTM ratio as shown
in Table 4. Assuming the managerial timing exists, this study
expects to observe higher drifts for the "value stock" who are
the frequent repurchasers.
However, the probability that all the abnormal returns
obtained in this analysis are due to chance is more than 5%
significance level as the p values for all returns are more than
.05 (p > .05). Nonetheless, the abnormal returns for the 12
months and 24 months of high BTM firms are significant at
15% significance level with p values equal to .1147 and
.1502, respectively. This implies that the empirical results of
this analysis are not robust enough to support the hypothesis
that high BTM firms outperform the low BTM firms in the
long run subsequent to the actual share repurchase, even
though the return drifts for high BTM firms is more positive
and increasing over time, as expected.
The full sample is also divided into three subgroups based
on the market capitalization to examine the return drifts
across the firm size as shown in Table 5. Literature review
discussed the literature that pointed out that information
asymmetry is higher for smaller firms. Hence, any new infor-
mation should give a higher price adjustment. Consistent
with Ramakrishnan et al. (2007), 115 out of 132 firms cap-
tured in the sample are the constituents of the FBM Small
Cap. Table 5 shows that the abnormal returns for the smallest
firm size are 6.12%, 22.38%, and 28.11% for the 12-, 24-,
and 36-months holding periods.
However, the probability that all the abnormal returns
obtained in this analysis occurred due to chance is more than
5% significance level as the p values for all returns are more
than .05 (p > .05). Even though the abnormal return of small
firms in the 2-year and 3-year periods are high and positive
(22.38% and 21.81%, respectively), they are only significant
at the 25% level. Nonetheless, the return of large firms for

the first year is the most significant among others (20%
level). This implies that the empirical results of this analysis
are not robust enough to support the hypothesis that small
firms outperform the large firms in the long run subsequent
to the actual share repurchase, even though the return drifts
for small firms are more positive and increasing over time, as
expected.
Table 6 shows the descriptive statistics for abnormal
returns using the CTIME approach. The monthly portfolio
abnormal returns are calculated using Equation 3. Based on
the three time periods, the mean, median, maximum, mini-
mum, standard deviation, and skewness of abnormal returns
are then obtained from the monthly portfolio abnormal
returns.
Table 7 clearly shows that no evidence of long-term
abnormal performance was found in the full sample. This
approach produces negative monthly average abnormal
returns for all three time periods and is consistent with Su
and Lin (2012) who are also using CTIME in their calcula-
tions. Meanwhile, other studies using the same method, M.
L. Mitchell and Stafford (2000), Lee et al. (2005), and Yook
(2010) found very low monthly average abnormal returns
with very weak t statistics (0.08%, 0.0063%, and 0.03%,
respectively), which is equivalent to less than 3% for 3 years.
The data quality for the regression parameters shows that this
study has a slightly decent fit with the data, with the raw R2
ranging from .64 to .68, which implies that the three factors
explain 64% to 68% of the abnormal returns. The traditional
beta of the portfolio, 
p
, is around .85, which is close to 1 and
is significant to the 1% significance level, which is expected
as a typical equity-only portfolio. The SMB loading s = 0.54
for the first and second year while s = 0.56 in the third year
are also statistically different from 0 at 1% level, which
means that the portfolio contains mostly small cap firms (s >
0.5). The HML factor h ranges from 0.04 to 0.03 and 0.01 for
the 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. This means that the
portfolio is a growth portfolio in general (h < 0.3), albeit the
insignificant value. The insignificant values for all h-loading
in all the analyses may be because the portfolio is not signifi-
cantly affected by the firm's value premium.
Looking into the 3-year holding period, the alpha value
indicates a monthly abnormal performance of -0.41% with a
very significant t statistic (t = -7.5662). Compounding this
monthly return over 36 months implies a 3-year abnormal
performance of -13.74%. The monthly abnormal returns are
also becoming more negative over the period with strong sig-
nificant t values. This result suggests that repurchasing firms
have severe underperformance in the long-horizon subse-
quent to the actual share repurchase. Therefore, the long-run
investors cannot benefit from the firms' buyback programs.
To check whether the long-term abnormal return is con-
centrated in small firms and in "value firms," the sample is
further partitioned into three subgroups based on the BTM
ratio and the firm size. Tables 8 and 9 show the results,
respectively. To be consistent with the previous studies, it is
expected that only high BTM and small firm groups have
high positive and significant intercepts. This study, however,
shows negative and significant alpha values instead. Yook
(2010) confirmed this finding as there is no clear pattern in
the occurrence of positive and significant intercepts () in
both analyses. In fact, the negative intercepts show a reversal
pattern from the expectation. Assuming a 3-year holding
period, the alpha value for high BTM firms is more negative
(-0.44%) as compared with the low BTM firm (-0.32%),
whereas the small firms group earns a more negative monthly
abnormal returns (-0.55) in comparison with the large firms
group (-0.27%). Therefore, it is concluded that in this sam-
ple, small firms do not outperform large firms and "value
stocks" do not outperform "growth stocks" based on the cal-
culation using CTIME for all three time periods. These
results are also consistent with Yook (2010) and Su and Lin
(2012) but inconsistent with the results calculated using
BHAR as demonstrated in Tables 3 to 5. Therefore, based on
BHAR, there is no evidence of over- or under-reaction,
whereas based on CTIME, there is clear evidence of over-
reaction that leads to negative performance.
Conclusion
Share repurchase is a relatively new phenomenon in
Malaysia, and the effects of the actual implementation are
still not widely discussed, especially regarding the long-term
performance. The purpose of this article is to examine the
long-term price performance subsequent to the actual buy-
back in the Malaysian market. The patterns of abnormal
returns are also examined across BTM ratio and firm size.
This study has implications for interested parties. Even
though Isa et al. (2011) stated that in the short-term share,
repurchase can benefit firms and investors in Malaysia, with
regard to longer horizon, this may not be the case. Lee et al.
(2005), Yook (2010), and Rasbrant (2011) also proved that
the total amount of share repurchased provides a significant
result of long-term outperformance by the repurchasing
firms. At this moment, in Malaysian market, Isa et al. (2011)
and Wong et al. (2011) found no evidence of abnormal
returns with respect to buyback volume. This implies that the
restricted amount of shares that can be bought back does not
provide strong price support to the stocks. Therefore, the
policymakers should look into the restriction and the impact
it has on firms.
Even though Ramakrishnan et al. (2007) found an increas-
ing number of small firms participating in buyback activities,
there is weak evidence discovered in this study that relates
the small and value firms to the superior long-term returns as
compared with the larger firms. Thus, although the firms are
relatively undervalued, repurchasing shares may not benefit
the long-term shareholders.
Overall, the results of this study provided strong support for
the efficient market hypothesis and ruled out the theory of mar-
ket under-reaction subsequent to repurchase announcement by
Albaity and Said 11
using BHAR methodology. On the contrary, market ineffi-
ciency is supported by the results of CTIME.
This study only uses 2 years (2009-2010) out of 5 years
(2006-2010) of sampling period as the other 2 years (2007-
2008) are in the financial crisis period. The year 2006 cannot
be taken into consideration as the estimation period of the
consecutive years includes the crisis period. This makes the
sample smaller as the estimation period of 3-year ahead is
needed to evaluate the long-term performance. We suggest
that the sampling period should be extended to a longer time
frame to provide a more accurate study.
Assessment for frequent and infrequent repurchasers can
be done to identify whether the frequency of repurchase has
an effect on the long-term performance. This has been done
in the U.S. market by Yook (2010) and Chan et al. (2007) as
well as in the Korean market by Lee et al. (2005). They found
that infrequent repurchasers earned much better price perfor-
mance than frequent repurchasers.
With respect to the results presented in "Results and
Discussion" section, some returns anomalies detected appear
to contradict the expected pattern, for example, the mid-
BTM return that is lower than the low BTM return. Bhunia
(2011) obtained the same finding, and he investigated the
matter further. He found that earnings growth also has high
influential power on the abnormal returns of the repurchas-
ing firms apart from the BTM ratio. This could be done in the
future research in the Malaysian market.
Separate evaluation can also be done by including the cri-
sis period in the sample, or by separating the crisis and non-
crisis period in the results. This is important as during
different economic conditions, investors may react differ-
ently to information in the market. A firm may experience
different nature in activities during this period including
share buyback. Therefore, external factors should be consid-
ered in the future study to better understand the effect of the
economic conditions of the abnormal returns.
