Shared Variance Among Age, Sensory Function,
and Cognitive Function in Older Adults

The common cause hypothesis of the relationship among age, sensory measures, and cognitive measures in very
old adults was reevaluated. Both sensory function and processing speed were evaluated as mediators of the rela-
tionship between age and cognitive function. Cognitive function was a latent variable that comprised 3 factors in-
cluding memory, speed, and verbal ability. The sample was population based and comprised very old adults (n 
894; mean age  77.7, SD  5.6 years) from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The results showed
that there was common variance in the cognitive factor shared by age, speed, vision, and hearing but that specific
effects of age on cognition remained. Furthermore, speed did not fully mediate the effect of age or sensory func-
tion on cognition. Some age differences in cognitive performance are not explained by the same processes that ex-
plain age differences in sensory function and processing speed.
EVERAL empirical studies have demonstrated a robust
association between sensory and cognitive function in
old age (Anstey, 1999; Anstey, Lord, & Williams, 1997;
Anstey & Smith, 1999; Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997; Linden-
berger & Baltes, 1994; Salthouse, Hambrick, & McGuthry,
1998; Salthouse, Hancock, Meinz, & Hambrick, 1996;
Stankov, 1986). A common cause explanation suggests that
this association occurs because "both sets of measures are
an expression of the physiological architecture of the aging
brain" (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997, p. 13). Measures of
sensory acuity have been reliably shown to explain large
amounts of age-related variance in cognition. For example,
Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) found that sensory vari-
ables explained more than 90% of the age-related variance
in a general cognitive factor. Likewise, Anstey and Smith
(1999) found that a latent variable of indicators of biologi-
cal age (including vision, hearing, forced expiratory vol-
ume, vibration sense, and grip strength) fully mediated the
relationship between age and a general cognitive factor.
Studies such as these indicate that age differences in sen-
sory functioning may provide a window through which to
view age differences in cognitive function (Baltes & Lin-
denberger, 1997).
Interpreted in the broadest sense, a common factor theory
of cognitive aging predicts that all factors mediating age-
cognition relations are measures of the same common fac-
tor. For example, both processing speed and sensory func-
tion should explain the same portion of age-related variance
in cognitive function. The role of processing speed has been
central to theories of cognitive aging for more than 30 years
(Birren, 1965; Salthouse, 1991). Many studies have shown
that speed reduces or eliminates the age effect on a range of
cognitive tasks (e.g., Bors & Forin, 1995; Bryan & Luszcz,
1996; Lindenberger, Mayr & Kliegl, 1993; Nettelbeck &
Rabbitt, 1992; Salthouse, 1992a, 1992b, 1996). It is there-
fore pertinent for researchers to evaluate the importance of
sensory function as a mediator of the relationship between
age and cognition concurrently with processing speed.
Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) evaluated the relative
importance of speed and sensory function in cross-sectional
models of age differences in cognition. In one model, they
found that speed did not fully mediate the effect of age on
sensory function but did fully mediate the effect of age on
cognition. In a second model, they found that the effect of
age on speed was fully mediated by sensory function, and
the effect of sensory function on cognition was fully medi-
ated by speed. They concluded that, although speed and
sensory function were equivalent in their capacity to medi-
ate the association between age and cognition, vision and
hearing were more important predictors of age differences
because they explained all age-related variance in cognition
(including speed) whereas speed did not explain all the age-
related variance in sensory function. These authors did not
find that sensory function explained any more age-related
variance in cognitive function than processing speed. In
terms of models of cognitive aging, sensory function and
speed were equally powerful mediators. However, in terms
of explaining overall age differences, sensory function was
a more powerful predictor than speed. That is, compared
with speed, sensory function explained a larger proportion
of the variance in age, consistent with the view that sensory
function is a reliable biomarker (Anstey & Smith, 1999).
Another approach to evaluating mediators of the relation-
ship between age and cognition is in terms of the mediators'
theoretical independence from cognitive function (Linden-
berger & Potter, 1998). Measures of processing speed are
essentially cognitive variables may overlap theoretically
and empirically with measures of cognitive function. For
example, many measures of cognitive function are con-
ducted under time limits, so the explanatory power of pro-
S

cessing speed may be partly due to the fact that it measures
this speeded aspect of cognitive performance. Furthermore,
measures of processing speed often entail a small memory
load, as do many measures of cognitive function (Piccinin
& Rabbitt, 1999). For example, participants must often hold
elements of the cognitive task in their mind while perform-
ing cognitive operations. Measures of sensory function are
from a qualitatively different domain than measures of cog-
nitive function. Although they involve some cognitive pro-
cessing in that participants must understand test instruc-
tions, sensory acuity tests are not speeded or timed.
On the other hand, the fact that sensory function alone
(Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994) and in conjunction with
other biomarkers (Anstey & Smith, 1999) has been shown
to explain all age differences in measures of cognitive abili-
ties may indicate that sensory acuity is just a proxy for age
(Salthouse et al., 1998). It is possible that sensory function
is no more than an index of age or time. If this is the case,
sensory acuity may not be a meaningful mediational con-
struct in this context and does not provide a substantive ex-
planation of age differences in cognition. Consequently, the
recent emphasis placed on sensory function as a mediator of
age-cognition relations may be misguided, and the empiri-
cal findings relating to the importance of sensory function
may be spurious, a proposition raised by Salthouse and col-
leagues (1998). At the conceptual level, this criticism may
be refuted: one would argue that even if the association be-
tween sensory variables and cognition is due to the fact that
sensory variables are good measures of age, then it is still
more informative to relate age differences in cognition to a
physiological variable than to a measure of time. This is
particularly true in late adulthood, when individual differ-
ences in biological aging increase.
Empirical evidence against the "spuriousness" interpreta-
tion of the association between sensory function and cogni-
tion in old age would be found if sensory acuity explained
individual differences in cognitive function that were inde-
pendent of age differences, or if experimental manipulations
of sensory acuity resulted in changes in cognitive perfor-
mance. Anstey and Smith (1999) reported that biomarkers
including measures of sensory acuity explained individual
differences in measures of crystallized intelligence that
were independent of age. Studies of young adults have also
shown associations among sensory variables and individual
differences in intelligence (Li, Jordanova, & Lindenberger,
1998; Roberts, Stankov, Pallier, & Dolph, 1997). Experi-
mental evidence for the effect of sensory deficit on cogni-
tive performance was also reported by Dickinson and Rab-
bitt (1991), although Lindenberger, Scherer, and Baltes
(1999) did not find a significant effect of simulated sensory
deficit on cognitive performance.
Explanations such as the common cause model (Linden-
berger & Baltes, 1994) relate the domains of sensory and
cognitive performance at the level of brain functioning. The
common cause model does not necessarily exclude the possi-
bility of small specific associations existing between sensory
and cognitive variables that are not shared with the more sig-
nificant common factor. It is possible that, in addition to gen-
eralized brain aging, peripheral changes in sense organs af-
fect perceptual and cognitive processing. Age-related loss of
sensory receptors and neurons may result in slowing of per-
ceptual processing and less effective and slower encoding of
new information. This may directly lead to slowing of cogni-
tive processing and increased errors on cognitive tasks. In the
present study we reexamined the role of sensory function as a
mediator of the association between age and cognitive abili-
ties in late adulthood in a large population-based sample.
Our specific goal in this study was to see whether the em-
pirical findings Lindenberger and Baltes (1994)--of a large
proportion of shared age-related variance among sensory
function, age, and cognition--would be replicated in the
Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA). The sen-
sory measures used in the ALSA and the age range of the
sample are similar to those used in the Berlin Aging Study
(BASE), but the cognitive battery is much smaller and in-
cludes measures of episodic memory that were not included
in BASE. Nevertheless, if a common factor is responsible
for the observed association among cognitive and sensory
function generally, it is reasonable to expect that this factor
would operate for a wide range of cognitive measures. Sim-
ilar to Lindenberger and Baltes (1994), in this study we used
speed as a part of the cognitive factor for evaluating the
general model, and then we removed speed and used it as a
mediating factor in subsequent models.
METHODS
Sample
The sample was drawn from participants in the ALSA
(see Luszcz, Bryan, & Kent, 1997, for more details). The
ALSA used the South Australian Electoral Roll as a sam-
pling frame to identify households with residents 70 years
and older. The sample was stratified by age and sex into
three 5-year cohorts: 70Â­74, 75Â­79, 80Â­84, and a fourth co-
hort of individuals older than 85. Individuals randomly sam-
pled within these cohorts were invited to participate in the
ALSA on a voluntary basis. The participation rate for the
baseline data collection (Wave 1) was 55%.
Data were collected in two phases with two different for-
mats. A comprehensive 2-h home interview was followed
by a further individual clinical assessment conducted ap-
proximately 2 weeks later. The home interview yielded de-
mographic data and information on self-rated health, de-
pression, medical conditions, cognitive status, memory, and
subjective measures of vision, audition, and physical perfor-
mance. Individual clinical assessments provided objective
cognitive and sensory data. For the first wave of the study,
1,947 participants (1,039 men) were interviewed, and 1,511
underwent portions of the clinical assessment. The sample
for the present study comprised participants who completed
the clinical assessment and interview and had complete data
on the variables used in structural equation modeling. This
included 894 participants aged 70Â­98 (M  78.16, SD 
6.69) of whom approximately 51% were male.
Measures of Cognitive Function
Most of the cognitive measures have been described
more fully elsewhere (Luszcz et al., 1997). Some were
SENSORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION P5
based on measures developed as part of the Canberra Inven-
tory for the Elderly (CIE; see Christensen et al., 1994);
these included Similarities, Definitions, and Address Mem-
ory. Measures are grouped according to the latent variables
used in the structural equation models.
Verbal.--Verbal skills were assessed with four mea-
sures.
1. Similarities. Three items (apple-banana, boat-car, egg-
seed) taken from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-
Revised (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1981) assessed verbal rea-
soning. They were scored 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) to
give a possible total of 3.
2. Definitions. Using vocabulary items drawn from the
WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981), participants defined three
items (repairman, terminate, compassion), which were
scored 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) for a possible total of
3. Test-retest reliability was .69.
3. Confrontation naming. A short form of the Boston Nam-
ing Test (Mack, Freed, Williams, & Henderson, 1992)
was used for assessment of confrontation naming. The
four different versions of this test were counterbalanced
across participants. They were shown drawings, one at a
time, and asked to name the object illustrated. According
to standard instructions, if participants were unable to
name the object or seemed confused about what it was,
they were given a stimulus cue (semantic cue). If they
were still unable to name the item, a phonemic cue was
given. Up to 20 s were allowed for each response. If par-
ticipants were still unable to name the item after both
cues had been presented, the label was provided. This
procedure ensured that participants knew the name of
each item. A score of 1 was given for each item correctly
named without cues, for a maximum possible total of 15.
Observed scores on confrontation naming ranged from 6
to 15.
4. The National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982)
measures verbal knowledge as an element of crystallized
ability (Crawford, 1992). It comprises 50 infrequent words
of irregular pronunciation that respondents are asked to
read aloud. The number of items named correctly was
used. Test-retest reliability was .83 (Luszcz et al., 1997).
Speed.--The Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) subscale
of the WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981) was used for assessment
of processing speed (Bryan & Luszcz, 1996; Salthouse,
1991). The participant was required to substitute symbols
corresponding to the numbers 1 through 9 into a randomly
ordered array of 93 digits. Symbols to be used were avail-
able throughout the task on a code sheet illustrating the 9
digit-symbol pairs. The participant was required to make
substitutions as rapidly as possible. The number of substitu-
tions completed correctly in 90 s made up the measure of
processing speed. Observed scores ranged from 0 to 67.
Test-retest reliability was .79 (Luszcz et al., 1997).
Memory.--Symbol, picture, and address memory were
assessed.
1. Symbol memory. The DSS also provided a basis for inci-
dental symbol memory. Participants were required to
complete all 93 substitutions to equate exposure to the
stimuli. Upon completion of the DSS, participants were
given a symbol recall sheet with the numbers 1 through 9
minus the symbols and asked to draw as many of the
symbols as they could remember with each number. Par-
ticipants had not been informed at any time that they
would be required to recall the symbols. The possible
score for symbols correctly recalled was 9, and this was
used as a measure of incidental symbol memory. Ob-
served scores ranged from 0 to 9. Test-retest reliability
was .73 (Luszcz et al., 1997).
2. Picture memory. The Boston Naming Test also provided
a basis for incidental free recall of pictures (Luszcz et al.,
1997). Participants were asked (without prior warning)
to recall the 15 pictures immediately after the test.
3. Address memory. Respondents were required to recall a
single name and address (Christensen et al., 1994). The
name and address were repeated up to five times until the
respondent remembered them. Immediate recall after the
first trial for the five components of the item and delayed
recall a few minutes later were recorded. The maximum
score was 10.
Vision and hearing measures.--Vision and hearing were
measured as follows.
1. Distance visual acuity. Corrected distance visual acuity
was measured at 3 m for each eye with a well illuminated
Snellen chart. If the participant wore glasses or contact
lenses but did not have them at hand, corrected visual
acuity was measured with pinhole testing. The eye not
being tested was covered with an occluder and testing
began on the 6/12 (.50) line. If the participant seemed
hesitant or unsure of him- or herself, testing began with
the next largest print, that is, the 6/18 (.33) line. The par-
ticipant was encouraged to read the smallest line possi-
ble. The criterion for distance visual acuity was the
smallest line read successfully, (i.e., with at least half of
the characters in the line correctly read). For structural
equation modeling, the logarithm of the minimum visual
angle resolvable in the better eye was used as an indica-
tor of a latent variable called vision.
2. Near visual acuity. This was measured at 20 cm with a
chart containing short passages of text printed in ascend-
ing sizes of font from 5 to 18. The left eye and right eye
were tested separately, and the score was the smallest
font at which the participant could read. A logarithmic
transformation of this variable called near vision was
used for structural equation modeling.
3. Audiometry. Portable audiometers with standard ear-
phones were used for threshold testing. The participant
was initially asked whether he or she had a better ear; if
so, testing began with that ear. Otherwise testing began
with the right ear. A bracketing technique was used to
test seven thresholds for each ear: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8
kHz. After a successful response, the presentation tone
was decreased by 10 dBHL; if the participant did not re-
P6 ANSTEY ET AL.
spond, the tone was increased by 5 dBHL. Audiometric
threshold for each frequency was determined when the
participant responded consistently (i.e., 2 of 3 times) to
the minimum presentation level on the ascend. For struc-
tural equation modeling, two ear-specific and one fre-
quency-specific indicators were used. The ear-specific
indicators consisted of the average of the frequencies of
0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-kHz scores in the left and right ears,
and the frequency-specific indicator was the average of
the left and right ear values for 4 kHz. There were large
amounts of missing data for the highest test frequencies,
6 and 8 kHz, so these data were not used in the analyses.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted structural equation modeling to evaluate
alternative multivariate models of the interrelationships
among the sensory and cognitive variables and age. For all
analyses we analyzed the raw data matrix using Maximum
Likelihood. If necessary, the direction of scoring of sensory
and cognitive variables was reversed so that higher scores
indicated better functioning. Isolated missing values of pure
tone thresholds were imputed on the basis of the partici-
pant's entire audiogram by the third author, a practising au-
diologist. No other missing data were imputed.
In the measurement model, all loadings were free, factor
variances were fixed at 1, and covariances among all factors
were estimated. We then specified structural models to de-
pict alternative interpretations of the data and tested them
for significance. There were three cognitive factors (Speed,
Memory, and Verbal) and two sensory factors (Vision and
Hearing). Three groups of models were tested. The first
group was based on the common cause model reported by
Lindenberger and Baltes (1994). The second and third mod-
els were also based on models reported by Lindenberger
and Baltes (1994) and involved removing Speed as a cogni-
tive factor and using it as a mediator.
RESULTS
Zero Order and Age-Partialled Correlations Among
Sensory and Cognitive Variables
Table 1 presents the zero order correlations and age-par-
tialled correlations among all variables. The correlations be-
tween measures of sensory function and age are similar in
size to the correlations between measures of cognitive func-
tion and age. From this table it is evident that associations
among cognitive variables were only slightly reduced after
age was partialled. Some large reductions in the size of cor-
relations among sensory and cognitive variables were evi-
dent after we controlled for age. There were even larger re-
ductions in the correlations between the measures of vision
and the measures of hearing after we controlled for age. For
example, the correlation between distance vision and right
ear average 0.5Â­3 kHz was reduced from .22 to .08, and the
correlation between distance vision and average of 4 Fs was
reduced from .17 to .04 after we controlled for age.
Measurement Model
The initial measurement model (MM1) included six fac-
tors (Memory, Verbal, Speed, Vision, Hearing, and Age).
Both Speed and Age were single indicator factors, and their
factor loadings were fixed to 1.0. The data fitted well (see
Table 2) except that the La Grange Multiplier test suggested
that confrontation naming be allowed to load onto the Mem-
ory factor, reflecting a semantic memory component, as
well as on the Verbal factor. When this alteration was made
and the model (MM2; see Table 3 for factor loadings) was
re-run, there was a significant improvement in fit (2 
36.6, p  .01).
The intercorrelations among the six factors in the MM2
are shown in Table 4. The sensory factors, Speed and Mem-
ory, had similar-sized negative correlations with age in this
sample, whereas the Verbal factor had a small negative age
correlation. This pattern of age associations is consistent

with two factor theories of intelligence (Baltes, 1987; Horn,
1987).
Evaluation of the Common Factor Model With
Structural Equation Modeling
The initial version of the common cause model (COM-
CAUS1) we tested was the same as that reported by Linden-
berger and Baltes (1994). Memory, Speed, and Verbal
loaded onto a single factor called Cognition. In this model
the effect of Age on Cognition was mediated by Vision and
Hearing, and there was no direct effect of Age on Cogni-
tion. The larger than desirable ratio of 2 to degrees of free-
dom in these analyses is partly due to the large sample size
in the present study. All other goodness of fit indices indi-
cated that this model was highly acceptable (Table 2). A
second version of this model was tested that included the
path from Age to Cognition and resulted in a significant im-
provement in fit (2  17.44, df  1, p  .01). This model
is depicted in Figure 1.
To evaluate whether specific effects of Age on Memory,
Speed, and Verbal were unaccounted for the model shown
in Figure 1, we tested further models that were the same as
COMCAUS2 except that direct paths were included from
Age to each of Memory, Verbal, and Speed. For the model
including a direct path from Age to Speed and the model in-
cluding a direct path from Age to Verbal, a linear depen-
dency occurred for the path between Age and Cognition.
For the model including a direct path from Age to Memory,
a linear dependency occurred for the variance of the Cogni-
tion factor, and the model where Age was allowed to load
on all Verbal, Memory, and Speed simultaneously had a lin-
ear dependency between the Memory and the Cognition
factor. The model shown in Figure 1 therefore provided the
best fit of the data. According to this model, most of the
Age-related variance in Cognition was shared with sensory
function, but a small amount of unique Age-related variance
remained.

we calculated the proportion of age-related variance in Cog-
nition shared with sensory function. This analysis was con-
ducted in latent space (Bentler, 1995) where the square of
the residual coefficient subtracted from 1 gives the multiple
correlation coefficient for the equation. The variance in Cog-
nition explained by Age was 22.56%, the variance in Cogni-
tion explained by Vision and Hearing was 31.94%, and the
variance in Cognition explained by Age, Vision, and Hear-
ing was 36.80%. Therefore, 78.46% of the Age-related vari-
ance in Cognition was shared with sensory function.
Speed as a Mediator of Sensory and Age Effects
on Cognition
In the next model (SENSPEED1) the Speed factor was
removed from the Cognition factor and used as a mediator
of the effect of Age and sensory function on Cognition. In
this model, Age had direct paths to Vision and Hearing, Vi-
sion and Hearing had direct paths to Speed, and Speed had a
direct path to Cognition. This model also provided accept-
able fit of the data but did not provide information about di-
rect paths from Age, Vision, and Hearing to Cognition and
Age to speed. In SENSPEED2, a direct path from Age to
Cognition was included, resulting in a significant improve-
ment in fit (2  15, p  .01; Table 2). In SENSPEED3,
an additional direct path from Age to Speed was also in-
cluded, and this also resulted in a significant improvement
in fit (2  14.96, p  .01). In SENSPEED4, a path was
added from Vision to Cognition. Although this path was
significant, it did not improve the fit of the model. In SEN-
SPEED5, the path from Vision to Cognition was removed
and a path from Hearing to Cognition was added (Figure 2).
This resulted in a significant improvement in fit (2 
13.23, p  .01) and was accepted as the final model of the
relationships among Speed, Vision, Hearing, Age, and Cog-
nition. When an additional model with additional direct
paths from Age to Memory was tested, linear dependencies
occurred for the path from Age to Cognition. A model test-
ing the additional direct path from Age to Verbal did not
converge.
Speed as a Mediator Between Age and Vision, Hearing,
and Cognition
The next series of models were based on the analyses re-
ported by Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) that examined
Speed as a mediator of the relationships between Age and
sensory function and Age and Cognition. In this model,
Speed was used as a mediator between Age and Vision, Age
and Hearing, and Age and Cognition. SPEED1 included a
direct path from Age to Speed and direct paths from Speed
to Vision, Speed to Hearing, and Speed to Cognition. The fit
of this model was barely acceptable (Table 2). The addition
of a path from Age to Cognition in SPEED2 resulted in a
significant improvement in fit (2  13.56, p  .01). In
SPEED3 a path was added from Age to Vision, also result-
ing in a better fitting model (2  83.24, p  .01). Finally,
in SPEED4, a path was added from Age to Hearing, result-
ing in a further improvement in fit (2  102.43, p  .01).
Figure 3 shows the standardized path coefficients for
SPEED4. This model showed that Speed did not fully medi-
ate the effect of Age on sensory function or Cognition as
measured by Verbal and Memory factors.
To test whether direct effects from age to Memory and
Age to Verbal remained, we tested two models. In the first,
a path from Age to Verbal was added to SPEED4. This re-
sulted in a linear dependency for the path from Cognition to
Memory. In the second, a path from Age to Memory was
added to SPEED4. This resulted in a linear dependency for
Figure 1. The common cause model including standardized path
coefficients with an additional path from Age to Cognition (COM-
CAUS2).

the path from Speed to Cognition. Therefore, SPEED4 re-
mained the model that best fitted the data.
Estimation of the Amount of Variance in Cognition
That Speed Shared With Sensory Function and Age
We calculated multiple correlations in latent space to en-
able an estimate of the amount of variance shared between
Speed and Age and Speed and sensory function. For these
analyses Cognition was a second-order factor onto which
Verbal and Memory loaded. For these analyses, the variance
in Cognition explained by Age was only 19.9%, the variance
in Cognition explained by Vision and Hearing was 21.50%,
and the variance in Cognition explained by Speed was
51.30%. Of the Age-related variance in this cognitive factor,
54.27% was shared with Speed and 68.34% was shared with
Vision and Hearing. Of the Vision and HearingÂ­related vari-
ance in cognitive factor, 53.02% was shared with Speed.
Summary of Results
We tested three groups of models that aimed to evaluate
whether a single mediational factor could explain the rela-
tionship between Age and Cognition. The first group of
analyses showed that the common factor model fitted the
data well but that a model including a unique effect of Age
in addition to sensory function provided the best fit. Nearly
80% of the Age-related variance in Cognition was shared
with sensory function. The second group of analyses evalu-
ated the role of Speed as a mediator of the effect of sensory
function and Age on Cognition. Additional paths from Age
to Cognition and Hearing to Cognition improved the fit of
this model significantly, indicating that Speed did not medi-
ate all the Age-related and Hearing-related variance in Cog-
nition. A third group of models was tested in which Speed
mediated the effect of Age on both sensory and cognitive
function. These models showed that additional direct paths
from Age to Vision, Age to Hearing, and Age to Cognition
were significant. This indicates that a significant proportion
of the Age-related variance in Vision, Hearing, and Cogni-
tion was not mediated by Speed. Compared with Age and
sensory function, Speed shared a larger total amount of total
variance with Cognition (i.e., the factor that comprised Ver-
bal and Memory). However, of the total age-related vari-
ance in Cognition, a larger proportion was shared with sen-
sory function than with Speed.
DISCUSSION
We used structural equation modeling to identify a com-
mon factor underlying age differences in sensory function,
processing speed, and cognition. Overall, the results of
these analyses are consistent with those of Lindenberger
and Baltes (1994) and support the view that a common fac-
tor explains most of the shared variance among cognition,
age, speed, and sensory function. However, significant
unique effects of age, speed, and sensory function were not
shared, indicating that small, unique effects of these factors
must be accounted for in theoretical accounts of the rela-
tionships among these variables. The finding of unique ef-
fects of age and sensory function in the present study, which
were not present in the Lindenberger and Baltes study, is
likely due to the much larger sample size and smaller cogni-
tive test battery we used.
The cognitive battery in the present study was limited by
the small number of test items on some of the verbal tasks,
the single indicator of speed, and the limited number of cog-
nitive factors represented. This was a result of time limita-
tions placed on the cognitive component of this large epide-
miological study. Although the DSS is a well validated
measure and widely used in cognitive aging research (Salt-
house, 1992b), additional of indicators of speed would have
improved the measurement of this construct for use in struc-

tural equation modeling. Nevertheless, speed was retained
as a separate factor in this study because of the important
role that it has had historically as a mediator in cognitive ag-
ing research. Because of the limited number of cognitive
factors represented in this study, analyses involving speed
were conducted on a cognitive factor comprised only of ver-
bal and memory factors. Verbal did not have a strong asso-
ciation with age, which reduced the proportion of age-related
variance in the cognitive factor. Previous analyses of these
data have also shown that age remains a significant predic-
tor of memory after control of cognitive and noncognitive
variables (Luszcz et al., 1997). It may be that memory does
not have as strong a connection with sensory function as do
measures of general cognitive ability reported in other stud-
ies (Anstey & Smith, 1999; Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997).
This may be due to age-related differences in strategy use
being present on memory tasks but not present on tasks of
spatial and verbal abilities (e.g., Moshe & Craik, 1996).
In the present study, sensory function explained more
age-related variance in cognition than that explained by
speed, even though speed explained more of the total vari-
ance in cognition than sensory function. These results are
consistent with those of Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) in
showing that at the statistical level, sensory function is
equally, if not more, important than speed as a mediator of
age-cognition relations.
The measures of hearing did not include the highest fre-
quencies, 6 and 8 kHz. These highest frequencies are known
to be unreliable (Hickling, 1966), and the measurable rate of
change in the very old is greater in the speech range (0.5Â­2
kHz) frequencies because of loss of hearing in the highest
frequencies (Brant & Fozard, 1990). If age differences in
cross-sectional patterns of hearing can be inferred from lon-
gitudinal patterns of hearing changes in old age, it is un-
likely that the lack of these highest frequencies resulted in a
significant reduction in the size of the association between
hearing and age. Consequently, not including these frequen-
cies would not reduce the likelihood of finding support for
the common cause hypothesis.
The limitations of the sensory and cognitive test battery
are somewhat compensated by the large sample used in this
study in that the study had a larger statistical power. This in-
creased statistical power also revealed unique effects of age
and sensory function that may not emerge in a smaller sam-
ple. Readers should therefore consider the size of the effects
found in the present study when considering the importance
of the findings.
Compared with results reported by Lindenberger and
Baltes (1994), we did not find that as large a proportion of
the age-related variance in cognition was explained by
speed, although the general results were replicated. It is
likely that the discrepancy in the effect sizes between stud-
ies is due to the fact that in the present study the cognitive
factor examined in relation to speed comprised only verbal
and memory tasks, whereas in the BASE study the cognitive
factor included measures of reasoning, memory, knowledge,
and fluency.
The results of the models involving speed as a mediator
also provide some evidence that the relationship between
sensory and cognitive function in old age is not fully ex-
plained by age and is therefore not spurious. An indepen-
dent effect of hearing on cognition was observed that was
not mediated by speed.
Altogether these results present a complex picture of the
relationships among sensory and cognitive function. It is
possible that a common factor representing general age-
related changes in neurophysiological integrity, along with
specific age-related and sensory-related factors, contributes
to individual differences in cognitive performance in very
old adults. The specific factors may relate to both test taking
and cognitive processing. Possible specific causes of sen-
sory effects on cognition include age-related changes in
sense organs and the effects of disease on specific parts of
the brain.
Another possibility raised by our results is that different
relationships pertain between memory and sensory function,
compared with other general cognitive abilities and sensory
function. Further research is required to determine whether
specific disease processes are responsible for these specific
relationships and whether a decline in both cognitive and
sensory aging is indicative of pathological aging. At this
stage we still do not know if changes in specific sensory
abilities indicate changes in specific cognitive abilities.
Most of the research conducted in this field has used only
threshold measures of sensory function. It is possible that
other measures and methods, such as sensory discrimination
tasks and signal detection analysis, may provide useful ap-
proaches to understanding the specific relationships among
these factors. Sensory and cognitive performance in old age
is also influenced by a number of contextual factors not in-
cluded in the models presented here (Anstey & Smith, 1999;
Luszcz, 1998). Researchers must conduct longitudinal and
experimental analyses of the relationships among sensory
and cognitive function to test and develop further hypothe-
ses about the general versus specific nature of the effects of
sensory function on cognition in old age.
