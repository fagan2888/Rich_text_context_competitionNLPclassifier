Introduction
Autism is currently the exceedingly prevalent neurological
disorder among children the world over (Chandler-Olcott &
Kluth, 2009). It is diagnosed in approximately 1:68 children
in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], 2014). This is higher than 1:88, which
was reported in 2012 (CDC, 2014). Whereas Zimbabwe has
about 600,000 learners with special needs (Chakuchichi,
2013), there is a lack of national statistics on the number and
percentage of learners with autism. The exceedingly com-
mon categories of disability among Zimbabwean learners
include intellectual and sensory impairments, including
autism (Chireshe, 2011; Majoko, 2013; Mandipa &
Manyatera, 2014). In alignment with several other countries,
including Botswana (Brewin, Renwick, & Fudge, 2008;
Chhabra, Srivastava, & Srivastava, 2010), South Africa
(Naicker, 2009), and Tanzania (Kisanji & Saanane, 2009),
Zimbabwe decrees the education of learners with special
needs including autism in regular classes (Chireshe, 2011;
Majoko, 2016; Mugweni & Dakwa, 2013). Pupils with
unique needs in Zimbabwe are known as "learners with dis-
abilities" (Majoko, 2013). These learners are entitled to
inclusion once the Department of Schools Psychological
Services and Special Needs Education of Zimbabwe has
formally identified them (Musengi & Chireshe, 2012;
Mushoriwa & Gasva, 2008), enhancing access, equity, and
equality in education.
Despite the worldwide pursuit of inclusion, a universally
accepted definition of it is illusive thus far due to conceptual
difficulties in defining it including what counts as evidence
of its model practice (Berry, 2010; Flecha & Soler, 2013;
Florian & Black-Hawkins, 2011). Inclusion can, however, be
viewed as a philosophy which entails equal valuation of
every learner as belonging to the culture of the regular school
class (Ballard, 2012; Berry, 2010; Florian & Linklater, 2010)
constituting presence, participation, acceptance, and achieve-
ment (Black-Hawkins & Florian, 2012; Forlin & Chambers,
2011; Humphrey, 2008; Slee, 2011). In Zimbabwe, inclusion
entails diagnosis and reduction of barriers to learners' access
to regular settings, including educational institutions, com-
munities, and families, and maximizing support practices to
enhance achievement (Chireshe, 2013; Majoko, 2013). Its

Practices That Support the Inclusion of
Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder
in Mainstream Early Childhood Education
in Zimbabwe
Tawanda Majoko1
Abstract
The international and national mandate to serve learners with special needs in regular education warrants examination of
support practices for including learners with autism in Zimbabwe. Entrenched within the inclusive pedagogical philosophy, the
current qualitative study executed individual interviews with 18 teachers, document analysis, and nonparticipant observations
in the Midlands educational province of Zimbabwe to explore support practices for including learners with autism in regular
Early Childhood Development (ECD) classes. The study revealed that support practices for including learners with autism
in regular ECD classes included entry competencies informed pedagogy, reinforcement, academic adaptations, socialization,
consultation, and strategic management of structured routines and compulsions. The institutionalization of comprehensive
teacher education for inclusion and collaborative culture could optimize support practices for including learners with autism
in regular ECD classes.

successful and effective practice embodies participation of
all learners and their families in the activities of the regular
school communities while meeting their unique needs, as
well as contributing to the advancement of these institutions
(Chakuchichi, 2013; Deluca, Tramonta, & Kett, 2013;
Mushoriwa & Gasva, 2008).
Since the adoption of inclusion in 1994, educational prov-
inces across Zimbabwe report notable increase in enrollment
of learners with special needs, including autism (Chireshe,
2011; Mpofu & Shumba, 2012). Research, both in Zimbabwe
and elsewhere, reveals that inclusion benefits both learners
with and without autism. Inclusive classes afford conducive
settings for growth and education of learners with autism
alongside their typically developing peers (Chandler-Olcott
& Kluth, 2009; de Boer & Simpson, 2009; Vakil, Welton,
O'Connor, & Kline, 2009). In addition, they can be stimu-
lants for learning, development, and feelings of acceptance
for these learners (Emam & Farrell, 2009; Leblanc,
Richardson, & Burns, 2009; Lindsay, Proulx, Scott, &
Thompson, 2014). Thus, inclusive pedagogical settings are
premised on equalization of opportunities in education. Fully
included learners with autism have more social support,
social networks, and better educational targets in comparison
with their peers in special classes (Leach & Duffy, 2009;
Lindsay et al., 2014). Learners with autism who are included
in regular classes develop a realization and accommodation
of individual differences (de Boer & Simpson, 2009; Symes
& Humphrey, 2010) as they are exposed to peers with a
diversity of temperaments and talents (Falkmer, Granlund,
Nilholm, & Falkmer, 2012; Leach & Duffy, 2009; Lindsay
et al., 2014). Inclusion in regular school classes also increases
educational expectations for both learners with and without
autism (Emam & Farrell, 2009; Finke & McNaughton, 2009;
Horrocks, White, & Roberts, 2008).
Limited systemic change in pedagogical institutions has
culminated in little progress toward inclusion for learners with
autism in the entire regular education curricula and contexts in
several countries, including Zimbabwe. Attempts to promote
inclusion and access to the regular school education curricu-
lum have resulted in the shift primarily from where a learner
receives his or her educational program, to what and how the
learner is taught (Ballard, 2012). Currently, the assumption for
teaching learners with autism is to consider these learners'
access to the regular classes focusing on the quality of learning
taking place (Humphrey & Lewis, 2008). The presence of
learners with autism in regular classes alone will not guarantee
improved outcomes for these learners (Bitterman, Daley,
Misra, Carlson, & Markowitz, 2008; Falkmer, Ochlers,
Granlund, & Falkmer, 2015). Successful and effective sup-
ports for their learning, acceptance, participation, and achieve-
ment need also to be provided (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth,
2009; Jones & Frederickson, 2010; Pellecchia et al., 2015).
Whereas in Zimbabwe, there is a dearth of studies on sup-
port practices for including learners with autism in regular
classes, internationally, a number of studies have been
carried out on the subject. These include Humphrey and
Symes (2013), Maich and Belcher (2012), and Leblanc et al.
(2009). Common features of these studies are pooling
resources, tailored teaching methods, essential training,
teamwork, establishing collaborative cultures with families
as well as nurturing a welcoming class climate. Although
these are presently considered model practices, further
research will demonstrate how they are implemented in
including learners with autism in regular classes. Many stud-
ies reveal numerous benefits of inclusion in regular educa-
tion while indicating that support practices for including
learners with autism in regular classes are a fundamental
global gap with respect to knowledge base (Emam & Farrell,
2009; Humphrey & Symes, 2013; Vakil et al., 2009). In sev-
eral countries, including Zimbabwe, inclusion of learners
with autism in regular classes is notably escalating since the
philosophy was globally adopted in 1994 (Majoko, 2016;
Musengi & Chireshe, 2012; Shadreck, 2012) making it
imperative to investigate how they are being served to
improve practice. In the absence of schools, teachers, and
parents' ownership and commitment, full inclusion of learn-
ers with autism in regular classes will not be realized (Symes
& Humphrey, 2010). Thus, the authentic voices of stakehold-
ers, who are the implementers of educational innovations,
including teachers require solicitation because of their expe-
rience and intuition regarding how inclusion of learners with
autism in regular classes can be enhanced. In the subsequent
section, challenges in including learners with autism in regu-
lar classes are presented.
Including Learners With Autism:
Challenges
Despite the dearth of studies on challenges in including
learners with autism in regular classes in Zimbabwe, several
researchers have explored the subject internationally.
Because there are individual differences among learners with
autism (Beaston, 2008; Dingfelder & Mandell, 2011; Hess,
Morrier, Heflin, & Ivey, 2008; Humphrey & Symes, 2013),
the challenges revealed in literature may not apply to all of
them. Significant deficits in interacting and repetitive behav-
ior, interests, activities, and communication characterize
autism (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013;
Humphrey, 2008; Park, Chitiyo, & Choi, 2010). Due to the
corresponding difficulty in social and language of autism
(Chandler-Olcott & Kluth, 2009; Humphrey & Lewis, 2008;
Lynch & Irvine, 2009), navigation of the social world is a
challenge to learners with autism (Jones & Frederickson,
2010; Mandell et al., 2013; Pellecchia et al., 2015).
Consequently, learners with autism are about 20 times more
vulnerable to social exclusion in educational institutions in
comparison with their counterparts without developmental
delays (Humphrey, 2008).
Fundamental aspects of development, which are often
challenging in pedagogy of learners with autism, include
Majoko 3
processing of sensory input, playing creatively, interacting
socially, and commutating verbally and nonverbally
(Beaston, 2008; Brewin et al., 2008; Emam & Farrell, 2009;
Wilmshurst & Brue, 2010). Comprehending and conveying
personal needs to counterparts and teachers often challenges
learners with autism (Kasari, Locke, Gulsrud, & Rotheram-
Fuller, 2011; Maich & Belcher, 2012). Following class
instructions and reading teachers' verbal and body expres-
sions may also be complicated for learners with autism
(Chandler-Olcott & Kluth, 2009; Segall & Campbell, 2012;
Wilmshurst & Brue, 2010). Because of sensory issues,
learners with autism have further difficulties in sustaining
noisy settings, others' touches, and keeping eye contact
(Leblanc et al., 2009; Lindsay et al., 2014; Symes &
Humphrey, 2010). School environments are, however, busy,
loud, and crowded (Farrell, Alborz, Howes, & Pearson,
2010), which complicates these learners' inclusion in regu-
lar classes. The complications of grasping the social domain
for learners with autism can restrict these learners' estab-
lishment and reinforcement of relationships with their peers
that can invoke stress and anxiety in them (Bitterman et al.,
2008; Brewin et al., 2008; Vakil et al., 2009). As a result of
the complications in emotional and social understanding of
learners with autism (APA, 2013; Lynch & Irvine, 2009;
Pellecchia et al., 2015), support practices are needed to
include them in regular classes. Due to the above challenges
revealed in previous studies, the current study sought to
interrogate support practices for including learners with
autism in Zimbabwean schools.
Rationale for the Study
According to Zimbabwe Ministry of Primary and Secondary
Education, including learners with unique needs, including
autism, in education is a national priority (Chireshe, 2013;
Mpofu & Shumba, 2012). Consequently, educational prov-
inces across the country, including Midlands educational
province where the current study was carried out, have cited
a notable escalation in the placement of learners with special
needs, including autism, in regular Early Childhood
Development (ECD) classes (Chireshe, 2011; Mugweni &
Dakwa, 2013; Mushoriwa & Gasva, 2008). As a significant
proportion of learners with special needs, including autism,
are educated in regular classes (Chireshe, 2011; Majoko,
2016), teachers and families confront the challenge of real-
izing successful and effective inclusion despite the lack of
clear policies, legislations, and adequate professional teacher
preparation in the country (Mpofu & Shumba, 2012; Musengi
& Chireshe, 2012; Shadreck, 2012).
While autism impairments are lifelong, they may be miti-
gated through early intervention (Dingfelder & Mandell,
2011; Hinton, Sofronoff, & Sheffield, 2008). Knowledge and
information base for education and medicine reveal that uti-
lizing inclusive pedagogy is among the best practices for
serving learners with autism (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth,
2009; Falkmer, Anderson, Joosten, & Falkmer, 2015;
Horrocks et al., 2008) as it supports the optimum functional-
ity of these learners. Nevertheless, globally, including learn-
ers with special needs in regular classes is a complicated and
ill-conceptualized domain of teaching and learning (Emam
& Farrell, 2009; Humphrey & Lewis, 2008) as schools strug-
gle to respond to the needs of learners with autism (de Boer
& Simpson, 2009; Falkmer, Ochlers et al., 2015). As educat-
ing learners with autism is a worldwide challenge, it is criti-
cal to explore support practices for including these learners
in regular ECD as it is the foundation of further education.
Parents of learners with autism, among other stakehold-
ers, often express dissatisfaction with pedagogical services
and programs and advocate for services and programs that
are responsive to the uniqueness of these learners (Lynch &
Irvine, 2009). Thus, more effort is needed to nurture regular
classes that are friendly to learners with autism (Emam &
Farrell, 2009; Hinton et al., 2008; Jones & Frederickson,
2010). As learners without developmental challenges usually
emulate adults'behavior and attitudes, the attitudes of educa-
tors toward the education of learners with autism in regular
classes are foundational as regards nurturing an inclusive
pedagogical setting (Barnes, 2009; Falkmer, Ochlers et al.,
2015; Horrocks et al., 2008). Resultantly, meeting the full
range of needs among learners with autism is fundamental
because these learners are likely to be socially excluded and
bullied (Jones & Frederickson, 2010; Kasari et al., 2011).
The realization of inclusion in education requires research
on teachers' comprehension of autism as well as their pre-
paredness to meet the needs of learners with the condition
(Park et al., 2010; Segall & Campbell, 2012). Nevertheless,
several researchers have examined beliefs, attitudes, and per-
ceptions regarding including learners with special needs,
educational processes, and supports in regular classes (Berry,
2010; Donnelly & Watkins, 2011; Florian & Black-Hawkins,
2011). According to the best knowledge of the researcher,
there is a dearth of studies on pedagogy of learners with
autism in Zimbabwe. Thus, this study explored support prac-
tices for including learners with autism in Zimbabwean regu-
lar ECD classes so as to add to the limited national literature
base as well as to glean practices to optimize access, equity,
equality, and participation of these learners in education in
tandem with the global and national priority. Specifically, the
subsequent research question was addressed:
Research Question 1: What are teachers' support prac-
tices for including learners with autism in regular ECD
classes in Midlands educational provinces of Zimbabwe?
Method
Embedded in qualitative research methodology, the current
study utilized a multiple-case study design. In the subsequent
section, the design, sites, participants, procedure, and analy-
sis of data of the study are presented.

Study Design
To solicit teachers' support practices for including learners
with autism in regular ECD classes in Midlands educational
province in Zimbabwe, this study was embedded in a multi-
ple-case study design. Qualitative research methodology
interrogates a given phenomenon from the people experienc-
ing it through textual descriptions that can be analyzed for
themes and can induce transferable interpretations (Pierce,
2008; Silverman, 2009; Wiersma & Jurs, 2009). As the study
focused on individual participants' views, experiences, and
practices, its methodological approach was entrenched in
phenomenology. Phenomenological research is grounded in
understanding of daily life situations of individuals (Pierce,
2008). Teachers' practices for supporting inclusion of learn-
ers with autism in mainstream ECD classes constituted com-
ponents of daily life that were the focus of attention of the
researcher.
Study Sites
Zimbabwean schools are categorized into 10 administrative
educational provinces. The current study was executed in
regular public primary schools in the Midlands educational
province. English is the medium of instruction in these insti-
tutions. Midlands educational province comprises public pri-
mary schools in rural, semiurban, and urban settings of
Kwekwe, Gokwe North, Chirumhanzu, Zvishavane, Gokwe
South, Gweru, Mberengwa, and Shurugwi districts. One
institution was drawn from each one of these settings from
each district.
Participants
There are 766 regular public primary schools in Midlands
educational province. To understand teachers' support prac-
tices for including learners with autism in regular ECD
classes, public primary schools were purposively sampled
from institutions that were inclusive of these learners. The
sample constituted 18 public primary schools. Six institu-
tions were drawn from urban, semiurban, and rural settings,
respectively. Recruitment of teachers was through contacts
with Midlands Provincial Education Offices of Zimbabwe.
The researcher distributed information letters to contacts in
the designated schools. Upon the head teacher's approval of
the study, information letters were distributed to teachers
who were perceived to satisfy the criteria for participation.
The criteria for teachers' participation in the study included
the following: at least a primary school teacher's diploma
with an endorsement in ECD and an undergraduate degree in
inclusive education or related field of specialization; at least
teaching experience of 4 years in a regular ECD class, includ-
ing a learner/learners with autism; and presently a teacher in
a regular ECD class with a learner/learners with autism in
Midlands educational province.
A total of 18 purposively sampled ECD teachers made
up of 11 females and seven males, one per participating
institution, participated in the current study. Theoretical
saturation informed the adequacy of the number of the
study participants. It was realized when there was no emer-
gence of relevant or new data with respect to respective
categories as well as when these categories were fully
developed as regards their variations, dimensions, and
properties (Creswell, 2009; Silverman, 2009). Each of the
participants taught in a regular ECD class which had a
maximum of 17 four- to five-year-old learners. Each regu-
lar ECD class included, at most, two learners who had high
functioning autism whose intelligence ranged from aver-
age to above average. Participants were between 31 and 57
years old with five to 15 years of teaching experience. In
addition to a primary school teacher's diploma with spe-
cialization in ECD, 12 participants had postgraduate quali-
fications in special needs education. Each of them was a
host teacher to a student teacher. The researcher carefully
gained entry into the schools, selected participants, and
established cordial relations as well as maintained ethical
protocols.
Procedure
The researcher sought and secured the ethical approval to
carry out the study from the Ministry of Primary and
Secondary Education of Zimbabwe as well as Midlands
Provincial Education offices. The researcher sought informed
consent from the participants before carrying out the investi-
gation. The study was carried out between October 2014 and
July 2015. Each participating school constituted a unit and
unveiled a distinct context of regular ECD setting and cul-
ture. To interrogate support practices for including learners
with autism in regular ECD classes, similarities and differ-
ences from these pedagogical settings were discerned by the
researcher. The researchers carried out 18 individual inter-
views with participants, one interview per participant. Each
interview lasted an average of 44 min. The following ques-
tions were designed to solicit data from individual teachers
on support practices for including learners with autism in
regular ECD classes:
·
· How long have you been teaching? (This was a probe
for demographic information including number of
years taught and teaching qualifications.)
·
· How do you serve learners with autism in your regular
class?
·
· What works well when including learners with autism
in your regular class?
·
· What can teachers do to include learners with autism
in regular classes?
·
· What else would you like to add that we did not talk
about regarding including learners with autism in reg-
ular classes?
Majoko 5
With individual participants' consent, audiotaping and
verbatim transcription of all individual interviews were
done for subsequent analysis. Audiotaping facilitated more
accurate collection of data. It also enabled the researchers'
attention to the participants while interviewing them.
English was used in carrying out individual interviews.
Participants were interviewed in their classrooms after
school hours, and participation was voluntary without any
compensation. In spite of the organization and structure
during interviewing because of the utilization of the inter-
view guide, the researcher ensured flexibility through con-
text-specific interrogation of issues.
The researcher carried out 18 nonparticipant class obser-
vations, one per participant. The focus was on regular ECD
class interactions of all learners and teachers, learner interac-
tions, pedagogical content, instructional approaches, learn-
ing materials and resources adaptation, instructional
language, class accommodation as well as inclusive class
management methods and techniques. Nonparticipant obser-
vations were grounded in gleaning teachers' support prac-
tices for including learners with autism in regular ECD
classes. These enabled the solicitation of "thick descriptions"
for understanding respective teachers' support practices for
including learners with autism in regular classes. These
observations lasted 40 min on average. The researcher
recorded field notes using an observation guide. The
researcher held informal conversations with the participants
regarding pedagogy after each observation as a follow-up to
ensure clarity. School observations through an inspection of
infrastructure facilities, including buildings, of each of the
participating schools were also carried out by the researcher.
To ascertain institutionalized support practices for including
learners with autism in regular classes, access audits were
executed. The researcher recorded observations in the obser-
vation guide.Activities, resources, materials, and facilities of
every observed school were photographed while social
record books, remedial records, schemes of work, and lesson
plans were analyzed to yield data on support practices for
including learners with autism in regular ECD classes.
Data Analysis
Data that were collected from several sites, methods, and
sources were triangulated to illuminate on emerging themes
(Creswell, 2009). Interviews, observations, and analyses of
documents assisted in assessment of the extent of conver-
gence and complementarity of findings and elaboration on
divergences between findings yielded (Silverman, 2009).
While interviews facilitated comprehension of the process
for inclusion of learners with autism in regular classes,
observations augmented the contextual comprehension of
the practice for inclusion of these learners. Interviews illumi-
nated on observations as well as aided in validation of other
observations. Triangulation of data constituted: identifica-
tion of the study focus; discerning trends within and across
sets of data; generation of initial codes; searching for simi-
larities and differences for identification of initial themes
that were overarching; reviewing of themes; definition, and
renaming of themes; and report writing. Data organization
and interpretation were grounded in the focus of the study.
Upon completion of the preliminary data analysis, the
researcher and two critical readers, who were experts in
qualitative research, presented the primary themes that
emerged to the participants for engagement and ultimately
enhanced trustworthiness.
Findings
Through analysis of data thematically, nine themes relat-
ing to support practices for including learners with autism
emerged. They are as follows: entry competencies
informed pedagogy, structured routines, reinforcement,
academic modifications, environmental modifications,
socialization, communication, management of obsessions
and compulsions, and collaboration and discourse. These
were foundational in including learners with autism in
regular classes.
Entry Competencies Informed Pedagogy
All (18) participants revealed that they entrenched pedagogy
in entry competencies of learners with autism to include
these learners in regular ECD classes, as confirmed in the
subsequent selected statements (fictitious names utilized to
ensure participants' anonymity and confidentiality):
Since my learners with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have
visual-spatial strengths, I use visual teaching and learning
approaches to keep them focused on the taught concept. I use
visual supports of interest to them including natural and man-
made resources and materials in my teaching. I use pictures of
local animals and fruits that motivate them to learn and keep
focused when teaching different subjects such as mathematics
and science, expressive arts and social sciences.
Meanwhile, other participants (14) reported that they used
learning styles that were commensurate with characteristics
of learners with autism:
Learning styles of children with ASD in my classroom including
visual, tactile, kinesthetic and auditory informs my teaching. For
instance, when I want a child with ASD to unlock the classroom
door when he or she gets to the classroom in the morning, I
summatively explain while demonstrating exactly how to do
this. This supports children with ASD to successfully carry out
tasks which results in their self-realization and social acceptance
by their classmates without the condition. (Mbeva)
Most participants (15) revealed that they were proactive
rather than reactive in managing the behavior of learners
with autism to include these learners in regular classes:
6 SAGE Open
As long as children with ASD do not engage in self-injurious
behavior, I patiently and consistently wait for them to calm
when they throw temper tantrums. I have sensitized children
without developmental challenges to continue with their
activities when their peers with ASD throw temper tantrums.
Children without developmental challenges understand and are
accommodative of the behavior of their peers with ASD. (Nyati)
Nhoro added,
I capitalize on the social strengths of my learners with ASD. In
cooperative learning, I pair or group them with their typically
developing friends. Children with and without ASD engage
socially and academically. Interests and choices of learners
dictate my grouping practices.
Observations and document analysis revealed that the
entry competencies of learners with autism informed peda-
gogy in regular classes. All participants (18) were observed
managing pedagogy based on the entry competencies of both
learners with and without autism. For instance, based on
their verbal proficiency, some learners with autism were
observed being taught communication of personal informa-
tion, including their names and surnames, dates of birth, and
villages, while others were observed being taught personal
grooming, including combing hair and tying shoelaces based
on their motor skills competence. With the support of student
teachers, participants were observed providing individual-
ized instruction and support including coaching and prompt-
ing to both learners with and without autism who had baseline
skills and competencies.
Strategic Use of Structured Routines
Most (13) participants reported that they strategically man-
aged structured routines in including learners with autism in
regular classes. For instance, Bimha argued,
I provide visual schedules of the events of every school day. I
put such schedules in a location which is easily seen by all
learners in my classroom. Because of these schedules, learners
with ASD are always clear of expectations and settled.
Kamba elaborated,
I write out visual schedules and pair them with picture symbols
that capture the attention of both pupils with and without ASD. I
attach these schedules to the desks of all pupils. Because of
structured routines with visual supports that speak to the interests
of learners, they are always aware and ready to execute daily
curricular and cocurricular activities.
As embodied in class diaries, most participants (14) were
observed extending visual displays and structured routines
that were ordinarily available for all learners. Visual supports
including visual cues to augment oral communication, visual
representations of steps in class routines, labeled chairs, doors,
objects, chalkboards, daily schedules, individualized sched-
ules for both learners with and without autism, and visual
schedules were observed for working stations. One participant
was observed requesting the learner with autism to read the
upcoming activity of the day on the schedule of the class.
Reinforcement
All (18) teachers revealed that they used reinforcement in
developing and maintaining behavior and motivation in
including learners with autism in regular classes. For exam-
ple, Haka argued,
I reinforce nonpreferred activities of both educands with and
without ASD with preferred activities, contingent upon
completion of assignments. When an educand with or without
ASD, for instance, has complications in keeping focus on any
subject assignment, he or she can spend 10 minutes in the play
centre after completion of his or her assignment. Both educands
with and without ASD are enthusiastic to complete assignments
because of my reinforcement system.
Tsenzi elaborated,
I carry out a preferred reinforcer assessment in consultation with
families of learners with ASD and their counterparts without
developmental challenges before teaching. I provide
reinforcement to learners with ASD and their typically
developing counterparts soon after their completion of tasks in
order for them to make the connection. I use preferred reinforcers
such as clay cows, wire cars and clay pots for effective
reinforcement and ultimate shaping of the behavior of the
learners with ASD which facilitates their social acceptance in
the class.
Several (13) participants reported that they used rein-
forcements to manage the behavior of both learners with and
without autism to facilitate inclusion:
I reward socially approved behavior to support all learners to
stay on task. This prevents behavioral outbursts by learners with
ASD which enhances their social inclusion in the classroom. I
use learners' favorite wild fruits, games, magazines and verbal
praises for them to concentrate on assigned work. (Shato)
The environments of the observed classes were friendly to
both learners with and without autism. For instance, store-
rooms were used as "safety zones" for learners with autism
for relaxation and calming down, and dull and limited wall
charts were used to eliminate distraction as well as sensory
overload for learners with autism. Consistent with their daily
lesson plans, all participants were observed using positive
programming interventions including direct teaching of
learners with autism to inculcate behavior in them for com-
pliance with the expectations. Reinforcements, including the
presentation of favorable rewards such as play time and ver-
bal praises to enhance appropriate behavior, were used. All

participants were observed using consequence-based inter-
ventions including ignoring behavior that was not interfering
with the class atmosphere and a token economy such as stars
and stickers to reinforce the behavior of both learners with
and without autism.
Academic Modifications
All (18) teachers reported that they used academic modifica-
tions to include learners with autism in regular classes.
I reduce the number of assignment items that learners with ASD
can complete. This sustains the attention of those with fine-
motor deficits and motivates them to learn. I also use alternative
assessments to include learners with ASD. Alternative response
modes including drawing and signing answers in assignments
facilitates academic achievement of learners with ASD. (Mhara)
Nzou added,
I seek support from other stakeholders including peer teachers
and paraprofessionals in teaching educands withASD. Specialist
teachers, educational psychologists, therapists, school
administrators, community health workers and parents support
me. They support children with ASD in the social, psychological
and educational domains including self-care which catalyzes the
inclusion of these children.
In alignment with the content and the teaching and learn-
ing activities of their lesson plans, all participants were
observed delivering teaching and learning content in response
to the cognitive level of functioning of learners with autism.
Participants were observed gradually increasing the level of
complexity of pedagogical content and supporting learning
with visual information. This was done using hands-on
approaches and concrete daily living examples in teaching
and learning while breaking down complex teaching and
learning tasks into subtasks which were taught and sequen-
tially reinforced based on learners' requisite skills. All par-
ticipants were observed analyzing and tackling academic
skills, social skills, and life skills as subtasks with each step
taught but then linked to the next in a chain of subtasks in
alignment with their lesson plans.
Environmental Modifications
All (18) participants revealed that they modified the peda-
gogical environments in including learners with autism in
regular classrooms. Specifically,
I adopt several environmental adaptations in my classroom
including eliminating distracting stimuli such as noise, providing
choices, favorite peers and activities and using a nearby vacant
classroom as a relaxing zone. These eliminate inappropriate
behavior and develop positive behavior in educands with ASD
thereby facilitating their inclusion.
I keep the desks of learners withASD and some of their typically
developing counterparts close to me facing the front of the
classroom to ensure that they are on-task. Since learners with
ASD in my classroom do not tolerate noise, I have designated a
tree at the back of my classroom as a quiet zone for them. They
also retreat to this quiet zone when they are overloaded with
stimuli. (Mhembwe)
Bimha added,
I eliminate environment nuisance variables to create a friendly
environment for inclusion of learners with ASD. I have
sensitized typically developing learners to maintain low levels
of noise in the classroom and I avoid bright wall charts. This
eliminates anxiety in children with ASD contributing to their
social and educational fitting in the classroom.
Consistent with their schemes of work and daily lesson
plans, most participants were observed using several class-
room management strategies to support a structured pedagogi-
cal environment for the provision of consistency and clarity of
expectations in specific situations and anticipation of upcom-
ing events to learners with autism. Daily visual schedules for
learners with autism, with different tasks and alternate activi-
ties which fitted into overall classroom schedules, were
observed. Daily activities, which were written in lesson plans,
were presented visually and put on the desks of learners with
autism to explain changes to activities and expectations.
Socialization
All participants (18) reported that they taught social skills to
include learners with autism in regular classes, as indicated
in the subsequent selected statements:
I provide pupils with ASD the opportunity to access peer models
and social opportunities for participation and interaction in
diverse settings and activities such as school, work, and sport
and recreation activities with appropriate natural cues, stimuli
and reinforcers. I also teach social skills and comprehension of
social situations using several strategies including social stories
written by parents, typically developing pupils and myself.
These social stories present situations from the home and school
lives which develop in pupils with and without ASD positive
behaviors for coexistence. (Bere)
Nyati elaborated,
I craft easily seen and understandable periodically reviewed
social rules which facilitate social interactions between learners
with ASD and those without developmental challenges. Since
my learners with ASD have social deficits, I use those without
developmental challenges as peer models and discussions,
debates, puppetry, questioning and rehearsal of strategies for
social interaction. I also integrate disability issues in teaching
which helps learners without developmental challenges to
understand and accept their counterparts with ASD.
8 SAGE Open
Most participants (14) were observed using several strate-
gies including the provision of opportunities for participation
and interaction in diverse natural contexts with relevant
stimuli, models, and natural cues. This was done to equip
learners with autism with social skills in alignment with
teaching and learning activities which were in their lesson
plans. These included social interaction­oriented techniques,
including puzzles, word games, role-play, drama, simulation,
discussions, debates, playhouses, ball games, and hide-and-
seek. Participants were also observed using social stories
which constituted descriptive sentences, directive state-
ments, and perspective statements in supporting communica-
tion, social interaction as well as including learners with
autism in regular classes.
Communication
All teachers (18) revealed that they strategically taught com-
munication to learners with autism in including these learn-
ers in regular classrooms, as indicated in the subsequent
selected excerpts:
In teaching communication, I target paying attention, imitation,
comprehension and use of language in social interaction to
facilitate the inclusion of learners with ASD. I take on board the
communication abilities of learners with ASD in my classroom.
Since most of them lack functional language, I use paired
gestures with speech to ensure inclusive pedagogy. (Bimha)
Nyati added,
As a class, we use sign language and total communication to
communicate with educands with ASD. As a result, there is
effective teaching and learning of educands with ASD in the
company of typically developing educands. Most importantly,
there is effective communication between typically developing
educands and educands with ASD because of use of alternative
communication.
Shato elaborated,
I determine communicative attempts exhibited by the behavior
of learners with ASD. I reinforce their appropriate behavior such
as asking to go to the toilet appropriately and ignore inappropriate
behavior such as screaming when signaling to want to go to the
toilet. However, when it is complicated to ascertain the function
of a learner's behavior, I use a behavior plan. This constitutes
the antecedent and consequence in managing the behavior of
learners with ASD. This promotes positive behavior in these
children and their accommodation by those without ASD.
Meanwhile, Bere argued,
I use concrete language to eliminate abstract concepts as pupils
with and without ASD misunderstand abstract language. In
teaching expressive arts, language arts, mathematics and
science, social sciences, technology and other subjects, I use
diverse teaching methods, strategies and techniques including
group projects, telling and listening to stories, song and dance,
discussions, debates, quizzes and rhymes to develop receptive
and expressive language in children with ASD. Children with
ASD engage in learning with the rest of their classmates as I use
teaching methods, strategies and techniques that are grounded in
their interests and needs.
Consistent with the content and activities of their lesson
plans, most participants (16) and typically developing learners
were observed using several strategies to support communica-
tion of learners with autism. These included clear, simple, pre-
cise, and concise language, and familiar, concrete, and specific
words used daily. Participants paced their speech according to
the abilities of individual learners to afford them time for pro-
cessing information. Participants also used social interaction­
orientedactivitiesincludingpairwork,groupwork,whole-class
assignments, and games to support communication, thereby
including learners with autism in regular classes.
Strategic Management of Obsessions and
Compulsions
All participants (18) reported that they strategically managed
obsessions and compulsions to include learners with autism
in regular classes, as confirmed in the following statements:
I prepare and explain any changes regarding the daily routine to
both learners with and without ASD. I put picture symbols and
texts on the schedule to show change in routine, for instance,
change in break time. I then verbally and visually remind
children learners with ASD of the upcoming events a few
minutes before the transition in order to lower the potential for
anxiety. (Bere)
Gudo elaborated,
When introducing new activities and reinforcing positive
behavior, I use short intervals of time as my children have narrow
interests which they obsessively pursue. I use task analysis,
progressing at the rate of children's response to new content and
activities. I use reinforcement to optimize the probability of
success as it results in changes in the behavior of children with
ASD. I also use age-appropriate teaching and learning materials
and resources, including toys, with both children with and
without ASD to avoid labeling and stigmatization.
Most participants (15) were observed affording learners
with autism the chance to retreat and relax and using proac-
tive teaching approaches in keeping with their behavior man-
agement record books. All observed participants had
behavior plans embodying targeted alternative behavior,
instruction and management strategies, and specific inter-
ventions based on identified behaviors of learners with
autism. These written plans spelt out the goals for change of
behavior, adaptations in the environment, and reactive strate-
gies, and set review dates for behavior goals.

Consultation and Partnership
All participants (18) revealed that they consulted and part-
nered with other stakeholders in including learners with
autism in regular classes, as confirmed in the following
selected statements:
Parents inform me about the current and future needs of their
children with ASD. I use their strategies to manage and
communicate with children with ASD. Typically developing
children inform me about the interests of their peers with ASD
including games and toys which I use in teaching. I also
collaborate with the community, speech and language
pathologists, educational psychologists, school administrators,
specialist teachers and traditional leaders to mobilize expertise,
finance, technology and materials such as toys, textbooks and
stationary for both children with and without ASD. (Tsenzi)
Nyana added,
I pool expertise in designing individualized educational plans
for children with ASD through working in consultation and
partnership with families, student teachers, parents, educational
psychologists, social workers and therapists. Because of
collaboration with our school community, donors, child welfare
organizations, organizations of and for people with disabilities,
social workers, therapists, churches and politicians, I have
expert, moral, social, psychological and material support in the
inclusion of children with ASD.
Most participants (16) were observed delivering services to
learners with autism in consultation and partnership with other
stakeholders, including fellow teachers, student teachers, typi-
cally developing learners, occupational therapists, speech
therapists, physiotherapists, nurses, community leaders, and
school administrators. For instance, some typically develop-
ing learners were observed informing the participants about
the favorite games of their peers with autism while some par-
ticipants were observed gleaning strategies from parents for
managing the behavior of their learners with autism, including
outbursts. An analysis of minute books revealed that most
institutions had multidisciplinary teams for the delivery of ser-
vices to learners with autism although such teams were not
fully composed due to the lack of some members, including
therapists and educational psychologists.All observed settings
had scheduled meetings on school improvement plans for
inclusivity in education for the year with parents, community
leaders, professionals, and other stakeholders.
Discussion
Since Zimbabwe adopted inclusive education in 1994 in
alignment with the global arena, learners with special needs,
including autism, learn in regular classes (Mugweni &
Dakwa, 2013; Musengi & Chireshe, 2012; Shadreck, 2012).
However, the presence of learners with autism in regular
classes does not guarantee their learning and their
counterparts' welcoming of them (Brewin et al., 2008;
Humphrey, 2008), creating a challenge for teachers (Lindsay
et al., 2014; Pellecchia et al., 2015). Inclusion in education
is, nevertheless, fundamental in social, academic, career
development, sense of belonging, and full participation of
learners including those with special needs, including autism,
in regular schools, families, and communities (Maich &
Belcher, 2012). Previous studies examined teachers' chal-
lenges in including learners with autism in regular classes or
their perception of the practice. There is, thus, a dearth of
studies on support practices for including learners with
autism in regular classes, hence this research.
Support practices for including learners with autism in
regular ECD classes in Zimbabwe found in this study are
evidenced based and/or commonly used in other countries.
In including learners with autism in regular classes, teachers
entrenched individualized instruction in whole-class peda-
gogical context. Individuality of learners with and without
autism informed pedagogy in regular classes. Teachers who
managed the pedagogical content, process, and assessment
in regular classes were found to respond to these learners'
needs, optimizing academic success and full participation of
these learners. Past research, similarly, found that inclusion
embodies access and success of all learners, inclusive of
those with special needs and needing teaching and learning
support (Black-Hawkins & Florian, 2012; Boyle, Topping, &
Jindal-Snape, 2013; Florian & Black-Hawkins, 2011; Florian
& Linklater, 2010). Individuality of both learners with and
without autism took center stage in teaching and learning to
enhance inclusion in regular classes. Teachers' understand-
ing that every learner with or without autism is an individual,
and the realization of the importance of looking beyond the
label so as not to define learners by their diagnosis supports
inclusion in regular classes. Teachers need to see past the
label so that stereotypes are challenged and their expecta-
tions about the capabilities of learners with autism are raised.
Teachers also strategically managed structured routines to
nurture rich pedagogical communities for learners with
autism and their typically developing counterparts in regular
classes. To optimize inclusion in regular classes, teachers
used visual schedules and reinforcement for both learners
with and without autism. This finding resonates with inclu-
sive pedagogical philosophy (Florian & Black-Hawkins,
2011), which requires teachers to extend what is generally
availed to all learners and the creation of community of prac-
tice instead of utilization of pedagogy that is appropriate for
the majority alongside something "additional" or "different"
with respect to learners who experience barriers to learning.
Teachers managed pedagogy of learners with autism in the
community of their peers without the condition. In the same
vein, previous studies reveal that inclusion entails the equal
valuation of every learner as a member of the school culture
(Flecha & Soler, 2013; Florian & Linklater, 2010; Slee,
2011). Simple environmental adaptations can support inclu-
sion of learners with autism in regular classes.
10 SAGE Open
Consistent with inclusive pedagogical philosophy (Florian
& Black-Hawkins, 2011), which dismisses rigid perceptions
regarding capability and the premise that including learners
with special needs hampers the achievement of those without
special needs, teachers further focused on abilities rather
than limitations of individual learners with and without
autism in regular classes. In developing and maintaining the
behavior and academic success of individual learners with
and without autism in regular classes, teachers used rein-
forcements. "Learning for all" informed teachers' manage-
ment of behavior and pedagogy in regular classes, which
potentially curtailed differences. Similarly, past research has
established that inclusive pedagogical settings support learn-
ers with autism to learn in the community of their typically
developing peers (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth, 2009; de Boer
& Simpson, 2009; Vakil et al., 2009). Positive reinforce-
ments, which are based on the interests of individual learners
with and without autism, support inclusion in regular classes.
Similarly, teachers used academic modifications in pursu-
ance of inclusion and educational success of both learners with
and without autism in regular classes. Such academic modifica-
tions included reduction of assignment items, task analysis, peer
and paraprofessional support, and alternative response modes in
question answering for learners with and without autism in reg-
ular classes. Thus, teachers' practices were in alignment with
the premise of inclusive pedagogy (Florian & Black-Hawkins,
2011) that all learners can progress. Similarly, previous studies
have found that inclusive education entails coexistence and
achievement of both learners with and without disabilities
(Ballard, 2012; Deluca et al., 2013; Slee, 2011). Teachers'use of
teaching, learning, and assessment strategies and techniques
that meets the individual needs of learners with autism, coupled
with support from peer teachers and paraprofessionals, supports
inclusion of these learners in regular classes.
Teachers also modified pedagogical environments to
include learners with autism in regular classes. This finding
is in alignment with Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011)
inclusive pedagogy, which obligates educators to research
and adopt innovative strategies so as to facilitate teaching
and learning of learners with and without developmental
delays. Teachers supported inclusion in regular classes by
making modifications to the pedagogical environments
which included the reduction of noise levels and strategic
seating arrangements of both learners with and without
autism. Similarly, previous studies advocate for nurturing
"autism friendly" classes (Barnes, 2009; Falkmer, Ochlers
et al., 2015; Hinton et al., 2008). In alignment with inclusive
pedagogical philosophy of Florian and Black-Hawkins,
which is grounded in viewing complexities with respect to
pedagogy as barriers in education, educators explored strate-
gies for establishing and reinforcing pedagogical environ-
ments that facilitated learning of learners with autism in
regular classes. Teachers' modification of regular classes
through creating structured environment can assist in includ-
ing learners with autism in these settings.
Educators further socialized learners with and without
autism in supporting inclusion in regular classes. Teachers
socialized both learners with and without autism to facilitate
social interaction in regular classes. Similarly, past research
has established that fully included learners with autism
socially interact (Hess et al., 2008; Kasari et al., 2011; Locke,
Ishijima, Kasari, & London, 2010). Consistent with the
premise of Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011) inclusive
pedagogy that "all" learners succeed, teachers socialized
both learners with and without autism using peer models and
in-class disability awareness information sessions. These
strategies supported full involvement and participation of
learners with and without autism in regular classes. Similarly,
previous studies reveal that inclusion entails equal valuation
of every learner as an integral component of the culture of
the school system (Ballard, 2012; Chhabra et al., 2010;
Donnelly & Watkins, 2011) involving access and success
(Falkmer et al., 2012; Flecha & Soler, 2013; Forlin &
Chambers, 2011). In the same vein, respecting the self-worth
of individual learners as equal partners in the class informs
inclusive pedagogy (Florian & Black-Hawkins, 2011).
Learning of social skills embedded in home and school con-
texts can foster social development in learners with autism
and ultimately facilitate their inclusion in regular classes.
In addition, educators supported communication of learn-
ers with autism so as to include these learners in regular
classes. In such facilitation, teachers paired gestures with
speech in communication; used sign language, concrete lan-
guage, and total communication; reinforced positive commu-
nication; and capitalized on the abilities of learners with
autism. This finding aligns with Florian and Black-Hawkins's
(2011) inclusive pedagogical philosophy, which requires
teachers to focus pedagogy on what learners are able to do
instead of what they are unable to do. Similarly, previous stud-
ies have found that preparation of teachers for autism (Falkmer,
Ochlers et al., 2015; Hinton et al., 2008; Park et al., 2010) is
foundational in inclusion of learners with the condition in reg-
ular classes. Learner diversity informed pedagogy in regular
classes. In the same vein, Florian and Black-Hawkins's inclu-
sive pedagogy requires teachers'accounting for differences as
an important component of development of learners in con-
ceptualizing teaching. Teaching communication to learners
with autism and the utilization of argumentative techniques of
communication based on their communication abilities can be
helpful in including these learners in regular classes.
Teachers also strategically managed obsessions and com-
pulsions in including learners with autism in regular classes.
In alignment with Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011)
inclusive pedagogical philosophy which is entrenched in
learning for all--the idea of everybody ("not some and
most") instead of exclusively learners diagnosed of "addi-
tional needs"--teachers' explained changes regarding daily
routines and used reinforcement focused on both learners
with and without autism. Such teacher application of a uni-
versal approach to the management of obsessions and
Majoko 11
compulsions potentially eliminated typically developing
learners'stigmatization of their peers with autism. Consistent
evidence reveals that social justice and human rights princi-
ples inform inclusive teachers' management of both learners
with and without disabilities (Ballard, 2012; Donnelly &
Watkins, 2011; Vakil et al., 2009). The creation of a schedule
by the teacher that allows learners with autism to know about
the daily routine and be aware in advance of events taking
place can aid in including these learners in regular classes.
Teachers engaged other stakeholders in including learners
with autism in regular classes. Teachers consulted and part-
nered with parents, typically developing children, profes-
sionals, and paraprofessionals in including learners with
autism in regular classes. This finding concurs with Florian
and Black-Hawkins's (2011) inclusive pedagogy, which
demands educators to collaborate with other stakeholders
who are respectful of learners'dignity. Teachers worked with
other stakeholders in including learners with autism in regu-
lar classes. Consistent evidence reveals that teacher collabo-
ration with other stakeholders in implementing inclusive
education is foundational in pooling inclusive resources
(Boyle et al., 2013; Chireshe, 2013), including personnel,
materials, finance, and technology.
Research Limitations and Future Research
Participants of the present study were purposively selected
from one province in Zimbabwe. As learners with autism are
included in regular classes nationally, practices for support-
ing inclusion of these learners need to be solicited from a
countrywide representative sample for transferability of
findings. Resultantly, the transferability of the present study's
findings to regular ECD classes that include learners with
autism in Zimbabwe cannot be known. Teachers may have
changed their instructional strategies because of their aware-
ness that they were being observed.
This study did not also incorporate perspectives and expe-
riences of other stakeholders inclusive of both learners with
and without autism and their parents, principals, social work-
ers, and therapists. Resultantly, whether these stakeholders'
perspectives and experiences on support practices for includ-
ing learners with autism in regular ECD settings are consis-
tent with those expressed by teachers cannot be ascertained.
Further research could solicit for the aforementioned stake-
holders' perspectives and experiences to glean diverse sup-
port practices for including learners with autism in regular
ECD classes. Comprehensive information that could serve as
a springboard for teacher preparation and development for
inclusion of learners with autism in regular ECD classes can
be yielded.
The present research further explored teachers' practices
for supporting inclusion of learners with autism in regular
ECD classes, yet other practices of other stakeholders
inclusive of parents, educational psychologists, and thera-
pists could also facilitate the practice of the philosophy.
Resultantly, future studies could solicit for the above-men-
tioned stakeholders' support practices for including learn-
ers with autism in regular ECD classes. As this research
revealed the criticality of the attitudes and preparation of
teachers in supporting inclusion of learners with autism in
regular ECD classes, further research could examine mod-
els of teacher preparation and development for autism.
Also, further studies could interrogate effective models of
collaboration between stakeholders and academic and envi-
ronmental adaptations in including learners with autism in
regular ECD classes.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Although challenges abound in including learners with
autism in regular ECD classes, educators exhibited concep-
tualization, positive attitudes and commitment to these learn-
ers, and the philosophy, and strategized to practice it.
Capitalization of education authorities on teachers' concep-
tualization and positive dispositions through supporting
them can optimize their support for including learners with
autism in regular ECD classes. Inversely, education authori-
ties' failure to provide support may result in teachers' failure
to include learners with autism in regular ECD classes. As
the sociocultural life and environment is critical in including
learners with autism in regular ECD classes, teachers' expo-
sition to sociocultural issues in their preparation and devel-
opment is indispensable in improving their effectiveness in
service delivery to these learners in regular ECD classes.
Considering teachers' centrality in including learners with
autism, teacher training institutions need to institutionalize
comprehensive teacher preparation and development for
autism to ensure teachers' professional competence in
responding to the diversity of learners with the condition in
regular ECD classes.
As inclusion benefits learners with and without autism
and the society in its entirety, all stakeholder individuals,
organizations, and institutions need to work in collaboration
and discourse for the advancement of the cause for the bet-
terment of humanity. As competence of stakeholders is inte-
gral in inclusion of learners with autism in regular classes,
staff development initiatives inclusive of conferences and
meetings need to be institutionalized for parents, teachers,
policy makers, and school communities to garner their sup-
port and commitment toward the practice. In tandem with
teachers' co-option of disability issues in teaching and learn-
ing, disability issues need to be incorporated in curriculum
development to sensitize stakeholders, including typically
developing learners, on human exceptionality and the impe-
tus for inclusivity. As collaboration of stakeholders is indis-
pensable in inclusion of learners with autism, communities
of practice such as teacher­teacher and teacher­parent are
instrumental in including these learners through synergy and
syllogism. As multidisciplinary teams were not fully consti-
tuted to support inclusion of learners with autism in regular
12 SAGE Open
classes, the professional training of staff is an imperative. On
account of the criticality of adequate resources in including
learners with autism, schools need to collaborate with other
stakeholder individuals, organizations, and institutions in
pooling requisite resources. Similarly, sensitization of teach-
ers on the available legal framework, technological, human,
time, financial, and material resources can enhance support
practices for including learners with autism in regular ECD
classes.
