Purpose of the Study: Assistive technologies help people with disabilities compensate for
their impairments.This study assessed which of 5 categories of assistive technologies--
indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, bathing, toileting, and telephone assistance--were
substitutes or complements for human personal assistance by differentiating between
total and formal personal assistance service (PAS) hours.
Design and Methods:The study analyzed 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey com-
munity-dwelling respondents receiving assistance with activities of daily living. Ordinary
least squares (OLS) on total PAS hours was estimated on the entire sample, and logit
and OLS models were estimated on the likelihood and hours of formal PAS, respectively.
Results: Assistive technology for indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and bathing was
found to be substitutes for total PAS, whereas assistive technology for bed transfer and
toileting was found to be complements for the use of formal PAS.Telephone assistance
was not significant for either total or formal PAS hours.
Implications: The use of some assistive technologies by older people with disabilities
appears to reduce the amount of informal care provided, but not the amount of paid
PAS.Thus, this study does not provide support for the hypothesis that the use of assistive
technologies will reduce use of paid care and, therefore, spending for long-term care.
Key words: Personal assistance services, Home care, Personal care, Assistive technology, Disability
Older and younger people with disabilities living at home
compensate for their functional limitations by receiving
personal assistance from human caregivers and through
assistive technologies. These assistive technologies range
from common devices such as canes and ramps to more
high-tech devices such as electric wheelchairs and devices to
monitor and prompt people with disabilities to take medi-
cine and perform other tasks like eating. With the increas-
ing demand for long-term care services (Johnson, Toohey,
& Wiener, 2007; Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development, 2006) and a likely long-run shortage of
personal care workers (Stone & Harahan, 2010), policy-
makers are interested in whether assistive technology can
be a substitute for paid long-term care services or whether
it is a complementary support. If assistive technology is a
substitute for personal assistance, such as when a cane is
used rather than relying on a human caregiver, then cost
savings may be possible by promoting its use. Alternatively,
if assistive technology is a complement, meaning both are
used together, such as when a mechanical lifting device is

used by a personal assistant for transferring a person to
and from bed, then providing such technology will increase
costs to the extent that it is provided, although it may
reduce unmet need (Agree & Freedman, 2003).
Between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, changes
occurred in both the U.S. disability rate and how under-
lying needs of people with disabilities were addressed.
Prevalence of any type of disability in the older population
dropped from 26.5% in 1982 to 19.0% in 2005 (Manton,
Gu, & Lamb, 2006). More recent studies have shown that
the disability rate has been relatively constant over the last
decade (Freedman et al., 2013).
This decrease in disability rates was coupled with a
decline in the need for personal assistance services (PAS)
(Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993). From 1992 to 2001,
in the older population living in the community experienc-
ing difficulty in self-care activities, underlying difficulty
in performing various tasks declined from 30% to 26%
and the use of PAS declined from 11% to 9% (Freedman,
Agree, Martin, & Cornman, 2005). These declines were on
the order of 1%­2% per year (Freedman et al., 2004).
One potential driver in the decline in the need for PAS
is the greater use of assistive technologies over the last
few decades (Kaye, Kang, & LaPlante, 2000; LaPlante,
Hendershot, & Moss, 1992; Manton et al., 1993). Between
1984 and 1999, the proportion of older chronically disa-
bled community residents using equipment, with or without
human help, for all activities that were analyzed doubled to
nearly 30%; in the same population, the proportion relying
solely on human help fell to 14% (Spillman, 2005). The
use of assistive devices with no human help for any deficits
in the activities of daily living (ADLs) showed an upward
trend throughout the 1990s that continued through 2004
(Spillman, 2012).
The policy implications of these changes are potentially
far reaching. With the aging of the population, especially
among persons aged 85 and older who are more likely to
have disabilities, demand for long-term support services
will increase dramatically (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010), but
the country may face an even greater shortage of long-term
care workers to meet that need than exists today (Institute
of Medicine, 2008). Therefore, understanding what role
assistive technologies may play in substituting for PAS is
important. Although a major benefit of assistive technolo-
gies is promoting independence for people with disabilities,
offsetting the need for formal (paid) care is also important
given the current budget environment. Moreover, reduc-
ing the need for informal care (unpaid care by family and
friends) may also increase the labor supply of taxpaying
workers (Institute of Medicine, 2008).
Prior research sought to determine whether assistive
technologies and PAS are complements or substitutes. The
limited research literature differs on this point, with some
studies showing they are complements (Agree, Freedman,
Cornman, Wolf, & Marcotte, 2005), some substitutes
(Agree & Freedman, 2000; Hoenig, Taylor, & Sloan, 2003;
Mortenson et al., 2012), and some both (Allen, Foster, &
Berg, 2001; Allen, Resnik, & Roy, 2006). The differences
across studies seem to depend on contextual factors, data,
and analysis methodologies.
A critical issue in understanding the relationship
between assistive technologies and PAS use is controlling
for differences in disability levels of recipients using these
services. If the underlying need is relatively light, some
assistive technologies may accommodate most or all of
one's need for help. On the other hand, if underlying need
is great, then substantial amounts of assistive technologies
and human personal assistance may be needed. Controlling
for differences in case mix in analyses is important if
policy makers are to accurately assess whether there is a
substitution effect between assistive technologies and PAS
(Hoenig et al., 2003). Otherwise, higher estimates in regres-
sion analyses of the effect of assistive technologies on PAS
would likely be obtained, reflecting the uncontrolled higher
level of functional limitations.
To address these issues, this study identified three
research questions: (a) Are assistive technologies and PAS
complements, substitutes, or both? (b) Which assistive
technologies serve as complements and substitutes? and
(c) Which assistive technologies have the greatest impact
on paid formal care? We hypothesize that after controlling
for potential case mix differences, sociodemographic and
other factors, all assistive technology types identified in the
analyses will substitute for PAS.
This study differs from prior research in three ways.
First, not all prior studies distinguished the effects of differ-
ent types of assistive technologies and their effect on PAS.
Second, this study uses more recent data, a wider range
of data to control for case mix differences, and has fewer
missing data than prior studies. Third, we employ a two-
part model to control for downward bias in estimates of
assistive technology on formal care use.
Design and Methods
Conceptual Framework
For persons living at home with functional impairment,
PAS and assistive technologies are used to address limi-
tations in performing ADLs and other tasks required for
independent living. To the extent that persons in need
cannot obtain sufficient help from assistive technologies
or informal care, formal care is sought for any remain-
ing needs. Given that formal care often is paid at taxpayer
expense (Kaye, Harrington, & LaPlante, 2010; Wiener,
The Gerontologist, 2015, Vol. 55, No. 3 423
2006), differentiating between formal and informal care
use is important, as well as assessing the amount of for-
mal care needed (Agree et al., 2005). Overall though, from
both practical and research perspectives, it is important
to understand the extent to which assistive technologies
can reduce total PAS, regardless of whether PAS is paid or
not (Hoenig et al., 2003). This study analyzes the effects
of assistive technology types on three related outcomes:
total PAS, the probability of using any formal PAS, and the
amount of formal PAS used if any.
Because many state Medicaid programs provide home-
and community-based services depending on the degree
to which an individual cannot perform ADLs (O'Keeffe,
Maier, & Freiman, 2010), we grouped an extensive list of
more than 100 assistive technologies in our data by the ADL
domains that they addressed. This effort was aided by the
survey questionnaire, which had solicited responses about
assistive technologies used by ADL domain. Prevalence of
use was high enough for various assistive technologies for
us to create four ADL domains: indoor/outdoor mobility,
bed transfer, bathing, and toileting. Prevalence was too low
to form categories for assistive technologies addressing eat-
ing and dressing because doing so would have produced
spurious regression estimates for these low prevalence cate-
gories. Finally, we also sought to create at least one assistive
technology category designed to meet instrumental activi-
ties of daily living (IADLs), but prevalence of these types
of assistive technologies was too low to support more than
one group--providing assistance with using the telephone.
We included a broad range of functional impairment
and health measures as case mix controls in multivariate
analyses (Hoenig et al., 2003). The degree of functional
impairment may be indicated by how many ADL and
IADL deficits a person has. In addition, whether they have
dementia may affect the ability to use assistive technology
(O'Keeffe et al., 2010). The need for supervision among
persons with Alzheimer's disease may limit the ability of
assistive technology to substitute for formal PAS. Health
factors potentially affecting the need for PAS are hypoth-
esized to include the number of chronic conditions (Hoenig
et al., 2003) and self-reported health status. In addition,
whether someone actively participated in the community
may serve as an indicator of one's overall ability, which can
be measured by whether they participated in events outside
the home at least once in the past month.
A range of demographic and socioeconomic characteris-
tics also are hypothesized to affect PAS receipt (Agree et al.,
2005; Hanley & Wiener, 1991; Johnson & Wiener, 2006;
Kaye et al., 2010; Spillman, 2005). These characteristics
were considered as confounders that needed to be controlled
rather than key issues of interest for this study. Considering
demographic characteristics, increasing age may result in
greater need for PAS because of the greater risk of disability
and the declining availability of care from spouses. Women
have been found to have a higher need for PAS than men
because of greater longevity and the tendency of men to
marry women who are younger than them. Whites when
compared with people of other races may have greater use
of PAS because of possible discrimination against other
races and greater informal supports among older people
in ethnic communities. In terms of socioeconomic status,
persons with less education and income may be more likely
users of PAS because of the greater willingness to receive
informal support. Finally, persons with Medicaid are more
likely to receive PAS because home- and community-based
services are covered under the program.
Data
This study analyzed the 2004 National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS), which was sponsored by the National
Institute on Aging and conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau, which includes a nationally representative sample
of the community and institutionalized populations aged
65 and older. Sample members are selected from a list of
eligible Medicare beneficiaries provided by the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The survey contains
information about ADL and IADL disabilities, helpers and
hours of help provided, equipment use, medical conditions,
cognitive function, and demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics (National Archive of Computerized Data on
Aging, n.d.).
The NLTCS began with a screener interview to deter-
mine a person's functional and residential status.Individuals
who are not functionally impaired and living in the com-
munity were given an abbreviated interview. Persons with
functional impairment and living at home, the sample of
interest for this study, were administered a detailed com-
munity interview.
Proxies knowledgeable about the sample person's health
conditions and physical activities were interviewed instead
of or along with the sample member if the sample person
was unavailable or unable to respond to survey items. The
proportion of proxies participating varied across sections
of the survey instrument, but comprised about one fifth of
all respondents.
The 2004 NLTCS contained 5,201 persons who com-
pleted a community interview. To construct our analysis
sample, we excluded people who were not in need of long-
term care services or were missing certain data.Respondents
were excluded from the analysis sample if they were part
of the new Medicare cohort that had no functional impair-
ment (729 people), had no ADL or IADL deficits expected
to last 3 months or more (1,175 people), had ADL or IADL
424 The Gerontologist, 2015, Vol. 55, No. 3
deficits but no helpers (1,143 people), and had unknown
educational status (59 people) or unknown overall health
status (14 people).The final sample size was 2,081 respond-
ents. Thus, the analysis sample population consisted of
older people with ADL or IADL disabilities.
Three dependent variables were created for regression
analyses. The first two, total PAS hours in the past week
for use in an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and
whether any formal PAS was used in the past week for use
in a logistic regression, were analyzed using the full sample
of 2,081 respondents. The third dependent variable, num-
ber of formal PAS hours in the past week, was analyzed
with the 686 respondents with such care using an OLS
regression.
The NLTCS includes questions about the hours of help
received because of a disability or health problem as per-
ceived by the sample person/proxy. Respondents were
asked "During the past week, how much time did someone
help you because of a disability or health problem?" These
questions were asked about both formal (paid) and infor-
mal (unpaid) caregivers.
The NLTCS includes information on more than 100
assistive technologies. Five variables representing assistive
technology use were created as the key policy variables of
interest for use in regressions. Each respondent was char-
acterized as using or not using each of five domains of
assistive technology. The five domains were technologies
intended to address indoor/outdoor mobility (e.g., wheel-
chairs, walkers, canes, railings, crutches, elevators, ramps,
orthopedic shoes, leg or back braces, chairlifts on stairs,
and prostheses), bed transfer (e.g., bed lift, wheelchair, and
walker), bathing (e.g., shower seat, tub stool, handle bar,
hand held shower, and rubber mat), toileting (e.g., raised or
portable toilet, grab bar, and special underwear), and the
telephone (e.g., amplifier and enlarged dialer).
A variable was created for informal PAS hours in the
past week and used as an independent variable in the logis-
tic and OLS regressions on formal PAS use. The remaining
independent variables served largely as controls in all regres-
sions. These variables included a range of functional sta-
tus, health status, demographic, socioeconomic, and health
insurance characteristics. In particular, we created a count
variable for five ADL deficits (movement, eating, transfer-
ring, bathing, and toileting) and an IADL deficit count vari-
able for nine IADLs (e.g., doing housework and laundry,
managing money, shopping, and using the telephone). About
15% of the sample had missing values for income, which
was imputed using the demographic variables in the analysis.
Methods
Five analytic techniques were used in the analyses. First, we
used the NLTCS weights to estimate descriptive statistics.
Second, because PAS hours in the past week are skewed
to the right with few respondents having large numbers of
hours, we created a more normal-shaped distribution by
logging the PAS hours measures when used as a dependent
variable. Third, when making postestimation predictions of
a logged dependent variable, a smearing factor was used
when transforming a logged distribution back to a normal
distribution (Duan, 1983). Fourth, the assistive technology
variables were interacted with the variable for informal
PAS hours but were not statistically significant and had
small coefficients. As a result, these interactions are not
included in the final equations. Finally, marginal effects
were calculated to estimate the effects of separately using
each individual assistive technology. To do so, predictions
were first estimated by making all sample members have
a given assistive technology, then again with no one hav-
ing that assistive technology. After making those estimates,
the difference between the two predictions for each sam-
ple member was calculated. Each prediction was estimated
with confidence intervals so as to determine whether the
mean difference in the sample for using versus not using
each assistive technology was statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the full sample of
2,081 respondents receiving some type of PAS. The propor-
tions for dummy variables in the table are reported as per-
centages in the text. The mean of the first three dependent
variables, total (formal and informal) PAS hours in the past
week, was 30.2hr (2.4hr when logged), but many respond-
ents reported far fewer hours. Approximately 25.1% of the
sample received fewer than four total PAS hours per week,
and 38.3% received fewer than eight total PAS hours per
week (not shown). On the other hand, 11.2% of respond-
ents received 80 or more total PAS hours per week.
One third (33.0%) of respondents reported using any
formal (paid) PAS, the second dependent variable. The
mean of informal PAS hours across the sample regardless of
any use was 22.2hr, much higher than the mean for formal
care. Approximately 85.7% of all respondents reported
receiving some informal PAS in the past week, with a mean
of 25.9hr if any informal PAS was used (not shown).
Assistive technology use ranged from 68.4% of respond-
ents using assistive technologies for mobility-related needs
to 9.3% using assistive technology for the telephone. In
addition, about 61.2% used assistive technology for bath-
ing, 46.3% used assistive technology for toileting, and
40.5% used assistive technology for getting in and out
of bed. Approximately 8.7% of respondents reported no
assistive technology use.
Regarding functional status and health characteris-
tics, respondents averaged 2.9 ADL deficits and 4.9 IADL
The Gerontologist, 2015, Vol. 55, No. 3 425
deficits. Most respondents (85.7%) reported having at least
one ADL deficit (not shown). Few (14.3%) respondents
reported having only IADL deficits.
Approximately 32.6% of respondents/proxies reported
the presence of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease or mild
cognitive impairment. On average, respondents reported hav-
ing five chronic conditions based on a list of conditions iden-
tified in the NLTCS. For self-reported health status, 13.7%
reported excellent health, 34.7% good health, 33.8% fair
health, and 17.7% poor health. Only 13.5% of respondents
reported being active in the community. Several demographic
characteristics are also reported in the table. Almost half of
the sample (47.7%) was age 85 and older. In terms of health
insurance, 10.5% of the sample had Medicaid coverage.
The third dependent variable, the natural log of formal
PAS hours in the past week if any formal PAS hours were
used, had a mean of 24.5hr (2.2hr when logged; Table 2).
Respondents with formal PAS use reported receiving an
average of 14.0hr of informal PAS in the past week. Table 2
presents results on remaining analytic variables, differing
from Table 1 by the samples involved in regressions.
Table 3 presents cross-tabulations of the proportion of
respondents using various types of assistive technologies
with regard to their use of formal PAS. Respondents with
formal PAS hours in the past week usually had much higher
proportions of assistive technology use than respondents
without formal PAS hours. For example, in the overall sam-
ple, 75.7% of respondents with any formal PAS in the past

only 64.8% of respondents with no formal PAS did so.
A similar relationship holds for each assistive technology
type examined.
Of the five assistive technology variables in each of
the three regressions (Tables 4­6), only one was sta-
tistically significant in each OLS regression (indoor/
outdoor mobility for the total PAS regression and tel-
ephone assistive technology for the formal PAS regres-
sion). Three assistive technology variables (bed transfer,

the logistic regression of receiving any formal PAS with

conceptual framework. For example, regarding demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, and functional status char-
acteristics in logistic analysis of receiving any formal
PAS, people who were women, older, had Medicaid
coverage, and people who were more ADL and IADL
impaired had a greater likelihood of using any formal
PAS. In the OLS regression on formal PAS hours, there
was approximately a one-for-one trade-off with infor-
mal care hours. That is, an increase in 1
hr of formal
PAS hours was associated with a roughly 1hr decrease
in informal care hours. R2 estimates in the two OLS
regressions were .28 and .34, showing good model fit
and potentially good control of case mix differences
across respondents as indicated by statistically signifi-
cant case mix coefficients.

and formal PAS hours in the past week that were per-
formed after the regressions were run indicate that assistive
technology use is associated with lower total PAS hours,
but modestly higher formal PAS hours (Table 7). Assistive
technology for indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and
bathing was each associated with approximately 8-hr
reductions in total PAS hours in the past week. Neither
assistive technology for toileting nor telephone was statisti-
cally significant. In contrast, assistive technology for bed
transfer and toileting was each associated with about a 4-hr
increase in formal PAS hours in the past week. Assistive
technologies for indoor/outdoor mobility, bathing, and
phone were not statistically significant predictors of formal
PAS hours.

Discussion
With the aging of the population, policymakers face three
interrelated strains concerning the financing and deliv-
ery of long-term care (Commission on Long-Term Care,
2013). First is the rapidly growing need for additional
long-term care services. If current use rates are held con-
stant, the number of people needing informal care, home
care, and nursing home care will roughly double between
2000 and 2040 (Johnson et al., 2007). The second fac-
tor is a likely substantial increase in public spending
on long-term care that will accompany the increase in
use. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development projects that public long-term care expen-
ditures in the United States, which were about 1% of
gross domestic product in 2005, will climb to 2%­3%
in 2050 (Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2006).
The third factor is that the number of people likely to
need long-term care services will likely increase much faster
than the working age population, which may create worker
shortages that threaten the ability to provide needed ser-
vices even if financing is available (Institute of Medicine,
2008; Stone & Harahan, 2010). For example, the ratio of
the working age population (people aged 20­64) to the
population most likely to need long-term care (people aged
85 and older) is projected to decline from 32.3 in 2010 to
15.3 in 2050 (author's calculations of data in Vincent &
Velkoff, 2010).

Faced with these pressures, policymakers are seeking
strategies that can reduce the upward demand for ser-
vices. One hypothesis is that the use of assistive tech-
nologies can reduce the need for paid and unpaid PAS,
thereby reducing the need for public spending and long-
term care workers and the strains on informal caregivers.
Previous research has produced inconsistent findings as
to whether assistive technology is a substitute or com-
plement to PAS (Agree & Freedman, 2000; Agree et al.,
2005; Allen et al., 2001, 2006; Hoenig et al., 2003;
Mortenson et al., 2012). In addition, by reducing the
need for human assistance, assistive technologies may
provide greater independence and improved quality of
life for people with disabilities.
This study found a complex relationship between assis-
tive technology and PAS use. In our analysis of the 2004
NLTCS, across the total sample, assistive technology for
indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and bathing each
resulted in about an 8-hr decrease in total PAS hours during
the past week. Given that the mean for total PAS hours in
the past week was about 30hr, these three assistive technol-
ogy types resulted in about a 25% reduction each in total
PAS hours. These reductions in total PAS hours appear to
result in only lower informal care hours because assistive
technology use either had no or only modestly positive
effects on formal care use. Only assistive technology for
bed transfer and toileting had statistically significant effects
on formal PAS hours in the past week. These two assistive

technology types appear to increase, not decrease, formal
care hours, although this finding may be confounded by
higher functional impairment if the control variables used
did not adequately account for it. Thus, they served as com-
plements for formal PAS rather than substitutes. In other
words, some assistive technologies appear to reduce infor-
mal care, but not paid care, and others are associated with
modestly higher levels of paid care. This study did not find
evidence that assistive technologies reduced paid care.
Why use of various assistive technologies would sub-
stantially reduce informal care hours but modestly increase
formal care hours is uncertain. One possibility is that both
informal and formal caregivers also benefit from assistive
technology use by care recipients. More obviously, informal
caregivers such as family and friends effectively decrease
their care time and responsibility if assistive technology is
used. But formal caregivers may also benefit from assistive
technology use if they would have been providing even
more care had it not been for assistive technology use by
their care recipients. Formal care providers may be instru-
mental in recommending assistive technology for heavy-
care recipients to keep care hours under the authorized
amount of care by third-party payers and to potentially
prevent injury to workers, both of which are benefits that
accrue largely to public payers. Given that most assistive
technology types had no effect on formal care hours, some
assistive technology may make the job of formal caregivers
easier even if it modestly increases formal care hours.
Another possibility is that assistive technology cannot
completely address the total needs of people with disabil-
ities and that PAS are still needed. When comparing the
mean estimates of assistive technology use for respond-
ents with formal PAS (Table 2) versus the entire sample
(Table 1), respondents with formal PAS were greater users
of assistive technology than those without formal PAS. Even
after controlling for case mix, it is likely that respondents
who were less severely disabled might have been able to use
assistive technology for most or all of their functional needs
and therefore may have used fewer PAS hours as result. On
the other hand, more disabled respondents might have been
able to use assistive technology for only some of their needs
(or a given assistive technology type may not have com-
pletely compensated for their entire need for help for the
task) and so had to use more hours of PAS than those with
less disability to make up for their additional need for help.
Given the benefits of assistive technologies for reduc-
ing total PAS hours, it is notable that assistive technol-
ogy is not used by everyone. One distinct difference of
policy significance is that assistive technology use rates
are approximately 25%­50% higher among those using
formal PAS compared with those not using formal PAS.
Even so, among persons with no formal care use, except
for telephone assistive technology, assistive technology
use rates range from only 35% to 65%. One possibility
is that assistive technologies may not be as accessible to
those relying only on informal care because they do not
know about them, do not know how to obtain or pay for
them, or cannot afford them. Wider adoption of assistive
technologies by those with only informal care use would
promote greater independence and increased quality of
life among such users and potentially allow caregivers
either respite time or a greater opportunity to work. It
may also be possible that they may not want to use assis-
tive technology if it means less personal interaction with
family and friends. The technology also may not work
equally well for all individuals.
The potential reduction in PAS hours is only one meas-
ure of the benefits of assistive technology. In addition, assis-
tive technologies may also reduce the intensity of formal
care activities or stretch informal care resources in ways
that our formal and informal PAS measures did not cap-
ture. These additional benefits may offset initial costs of
acquiring and learning to use assistive technologies for
which this study did not account.
Although this study provides new information about
the relationship between assistive technology and the use

of PAS, it has a number of limitations. The potential inad-
equacy of the case mix control variables is the primary
study limitation. The marginal effects calculations derived
from the regressions are unbiased only if regression mod-
els adequately control for case mix differences in care need
across recipients. Otherwise, we would overstate the effect
of assistive technologies on PAS and not observe the substi-
tution effect found in total PAS hours. High R2 values for
model fit (meaning we found an adequate set of case mix
adjusters), and the statistically nonsignificant findings, or
modest positive effects of assistive technology use on for-
mal care use, suggest that case mix differences are largely
controlled.
This study used measures for functional and cognitive
status, the number of chronic conditions, self-reported
health status, and community participation to control for
case mix differences. Using older NLTCS data, Hoenig and
colleagues (2003) found that assistive technology use and
PAS are correlated with frailty, but once frailty is controlled
for, a substitution effect was found, resulting in four fewer
total PAS hours per week if any assistive technologies were
used. The current study also found a substitution effect for
total PAS hours, subject to modestly higher formal care use
for two assistive technology types.
In addition to any potential failure of case mix controls,
this study had four other limitations. First, cross-sectional
data were used, whereas panel data may have provided bet-
ter detection of changes in formal and informal PAS over
time. Moreover, some assistive technologies have changed
substantially over time and with those changes the dynam-
ics between assistive technologies and PAS may have
changed as well.
Second, formal and informal care and assistive technol-
ogy use may be simultaneously determined in practice, sug-
gesting potential endogeneity between PAS and assistive
technology use. No plausible instrumental variable was
available to allow for potential correction with two-stage
least squares estimation, and such estimation is known to
introduce measurement error in estimates. This approach
is consistent with the work of other researchers (Agree
et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2001; Hoenig et al., 2003). Third,
although this study addresses PAS utilization, it does not
assess needs for services; thus, it cannot address whether
people using assistive technology have fewer unmet needs.
Fourth, the study only examines the impact of assistive tech-
nologies on the use of PAS in the community. Assistive tech-
nologies also may help prevent or minimize significant care
needs with high costs (e.g., emergency room visits, hospital
admissions, or nursing home use), although some studies
have found that home care use does not substantially affect
acute care use (Anderson, Wiener, & Khatutsky, 2006).
Fifth, our categorical measures of assistive technology treat
each device within each ADL category as equal, whereas
different devices within an ADL category may not have the
same importance or value in decreasing PAS hours.
Understanding the relationship between assistive tech-
nology and PAS use, and how both affect the disablement
process, can lead to better policies to promote independ-
ent living. Future research on this topic could focus on the
impact of the newer "high-tech" assistive technologies and
on the effectiveness of assistive technologies for certain
subpopulations, such as people with Alzheimer's disease
(O'Keeffe et al., 2010). Improvements in assistive technol-
ogy devices and policies to promote assistive technology
adaptation are needed to promote greater use. The goals of
increased use of assistive technologies should be to increase
the independence of people with disabilities, reduce the
strain on informal caregivers, and reduce the need for ser-
vices by paid caregivers.
