Introduction
If blood is a special substance (as Faust and Talking Heads
maintained), royal blood is in a category of its own. When the
cultural heritage of royalty is combined with the rituals of an
ancient religion, the result is likely to be a fertile source of gos-
sip and stories, both factual and invented. A case in point was
the media commentary on the birth of Prince William's son in
July 2013 and the breathless (not to say prurient) speculations
on the fate of his penis. As routine circumcision lost favor in
Britain during the 1950s, one's natural assumption was that the
baby would be treated like any other British-born boy; but
according to London's Daily Telegraph there is something
"odd" about the British royal family that placed a question mark
over his foreskin (Wallop, 2013). That something is the family's
alleged "tradition of circumcision." The tradition is usually
stated to have begun with Queen Victoria, but in the media free-
for-all inspired by Prince George's birth, some news outlets and
commentators pushed it right back to the beginning of the 18th
century and the first of the Hanoverians. What is striking about
the media and the online commentary is that nobody seems to
have questioned the veracity or even the likelihood of these
claims--a deficiency that we aim to correct in this article.
Three Versions of the Legend
In their contemporary presentation, accounts of the royal
family's circumcision tradition take three forms:
1. Queen Victoria believed the British royal family, and
thus herself, to be descended from King David, and
accordingly circumcised all her male children, begin-
ning with Albert Edward (later Edward VII). This
story was retold in countless media features, websites
and blogs at the time of Prince George's birth, and
can also be found in several academic publications,
such as Shalom Goldman's God's Sacred Tongue
(2004), which states,
As late as the mid-nineteenth century influential British
aristocrats . . . adopted a "British Israelite" ideology.. . . Though
this group later discredited itself with its reactionary politics and
thinly veiled anti-Semitism, certain of its ideas still persist in the
upper reaches of British society.. . . some insist on a biological
connection between English royalty and the ancient Davidic
kingship. Queen Victoria seems to have subscribed to this
Davidic theory and had her male children circumcised by a
Jewish ritual circumciser, a mohel. Both Edward VII, the duke
of Windsor, and Charles, the current Prince of Whales [sic],

The British Royal Family's Circumcision
Tradition: Genesis and Evolution of a
Contemporary Legend
Robert Darby1 and John Cozijn2
Abstract
The birth of Prince William's son in July 2013 was the occasion for an outpouring of media speculation about the fate of the
royal baby's foreskin. The possibility that he might be circumcised was connected to a purported tradition of circumcision
within the British royal family, said to be have been initiated either by Queen Victoria or by George I. In this article, we
trace the origins and evolution of these stories and assess their validity. Our conclusion is that belief in a royal circumcision
tradition derives from the reported circumcision of Prince Charles by the mohel Jacob Snowman in 1948, and the efforts of
the British Israelite movement to concoct a "lost tribes of Israel" origin for the British race. These elements merged into a
fully developed narrative that was widely disseminated from the late 1990s. The initially separate claim that the tradition was
imported from Hanover by George I can be sourced precisely to 2012. We further show that these stories are inventions,
and that the royal family circumcision tradition should be regarded as a classic instance of a contemporary legend or urban
myth.

were circumcised by a well-known London physician and
mohel, Dr. Jacob Snowman. (p. 21)
Goldman's source for these claims is an article in a popular
Jewish magazine by Edgar Schoen (1997), a retiredAmerican
MD with strong pro-circumcision sympathies, a point to
which we shall return. Brian Morris, a professor of molecular
biology at the University of Sydney, similarly states on his
website Circumcision: An Evidence-Based Appraisal,
The British Royal Family and the upper classes are circumcised
and the lower classes and those who left school before 17 much
less so. Queen Victoria believed her family descended from
King David (of the Biblical Old Testament) and sanctioned
circumcision. (Morris, 2013a)
2. A version of Queen Victoria story in a recent American
pregnancy manual takes a slightly different angle:
Circumcision was unheard of by Christians in Europe orAmerica
until after 1841, when Queen Victoria's doctor (who had travelled
through Africa and the Middle East) advised her to circumcise
baby Prince Albert [i.e., Edward]. Victoria did, was happy with
the results, and the British royal family has kept the tradition ever
since. (No source given; Jones & Jones, 2004, p. 403)
Here it is not Victoria's belief about her ancestry that
determined her decision, but a recommendation from her
medical advisor. On the face of it, this story has greater plau-
sibility, though it is by far the least commonly heard, and
surfaced only briefly on Twitter at the time of Prince George's
birth (Jones, 2013).
3. A third version of the story seems to have been newly
minted in response to the birth of Prince William's
baby in July 2013, namely, that the circumcision tradi-
tion was introduced by George I on his arrival from
Hanover in 1714. According to an article in the
Jerusalem Post, widely copied in other (especially the
United States) media,
Since the time of King George I (1660-1727), new-born male-
members of the Royal House of England have been ritually
circumcised.. . . Queen Victoria, known for her more prudish
sentiment, was certainly not amused by foreskin and had all her
male offspring circumcised. (Weiniger, 2013)
Not surprisingly, the article gives no source for these
claims, and does not tell us whether the Hanoverian dynasty
were already practicing circumcision back in Germany, or
whether "the tradition" started only on their arrival in England.
Royal Circumcision Tradition: Birth of
a Contemporary Legend
It is not clear when the Queen Victoria story first emerged;
like all urban legends its origins are obscure and perhaps
impossible to pin down. An early sighting is the article by
Edgar Schoen cited by Professor Goldman, "The circumci-
sion decision," in which Schoen laments the decline of rou-
tine circumcision in the United States, stresses the medical
benefits supposedly associated with it, and hopes/predicts
that the trend away from circumcision will reverse. Along
the way he adds historical tidbits on the connection between
circumcision and royalty:
Queen Victoria, convinced that the British royal family was
descended from King David, had her male offspring circumcised.
This tradition continued through Edward VII, the Duke of
Windsor, and Charles, the current Prince of Wales, who was
circumcised by a well-known physician and mohel, Dr. Jacob
Snowman. (Schoen, 1997)
He also states--mistakenly (Androutsos, 2002)--that
Louis XVI of France was circumcised because of a tight
foreskin, and regrets that the British tradition came to an end
with Princes William and Harry, neither of whom he believes
were circumcised. Schoen repeats this story, minus the
Davidic lineage, in a later booklet advocating widespread
routine infant circumcision:
It seems that since the time of Queen Victoria all males of the
British Royal Family were circumcised shortly after birth. In
keeping with this tradition, the circumcision of the infant Prince
Charles was carried out at Buckingham Palace by Dr Jacob
Snowman, a well known London physician, who was not only a
surgeon, but an Orthodox Jew and a Mohel, a religious
circumciser. But the new Royal young couple decided to end
this traditional circumcision practice, and both of their sons, the
Princes William and Harry, were left "intact," the word used by
the opponents of circumcision to describe the uncircumcised
state. (Schoen, 2005, pp. 80-81)
Schoen introduces this information in the context of an
attack on NOCIRC, a community-based American organiza-
tion campaigning against nontherapeutic (routine) circumci-
sion of infants, as is common in the United States (Owings,
Uddin, & Williams, 2013). He goes on to deplore the disap-
pearance of routine circumcision in Britain, and to make
various guesses as to the reasons for this development,
among which are a fashion (favored by Princess Diana) "to
try avoiding all discomfort to newborns," and a feeling that
"the uncircumcised penis was . . . considered `genital chic.'"
Schoen--a medical practitioner with no expertise in medical
or cultural history--gives no references for his own claims,
and one questions the propriety of a scholar such as Goldman
citing such an unreliable source in an academic publication.
When we asked him about his own source, however, Schoen
was very forthcoming:
I got the info regarding Queen Victoria indirectly from Dr Jacob
Snowman, the London physician and Mohel, who, as you noted,
performed Prince Charles' circumcision.. . . I didn't get the
information directly from Dr Snowman, who was already dead
when I found about his royal role. Rather I found out about it
Darby and Cozijn 3
from Dr Morris Sifman, who was also a London physician and
Mohel. In 1996 Dr Sifman wrote me to say that he had read
some of my work and asked if I had suggestions as to how he
could deal with an active anti-circumcision group, which
included some secular Jews, that was harassing him and getting
a good deal of media attention in England. As you may be aware
the British medical establishment has long been outspoken
against circumcision, so he couldn't get help from them. Over
the next couple of years I communicated with Dr Sifman and
actually met with him on a trip my wife and I took to London.
Dr. Sifman was probably the most active Mohel among the
Orthodox Jewish community in London at the time. Snowman
had died and he seemed to be his successor. Although Sifman
didn't mention being called upon by royalty, he knew Snowman
well. He mentioned that Snowman had told him that before
Prince Charles he had circumcised other less prominent royal
family members and other nobility males, and that he was aware
of Mohels before him who had also circumcised royal family
members. It was Snowman's understanding that the practice
went back to Queen Victoria's era, which was about the time that
newborn circumcision started to become the practice in the US
as well, mainly among the upper classes. (E. Schoen, personal
communication, August 16, 2013)
This account is fascinating as an archetypal instance of
how an urban (or contemporary) legend emerges and spreads.
First there is an oral tradition within a defined community;
then there is hearsay as the story is passed on to others
(Dr. Sifman heard it from Dr. Snowman; he told me;
Snowman believed that . . .); next the story is put into print
by somebody with sufficient intellectual authority to get
away with not giving a source; and finally the information is
cited as a fact by others. All the elements of a classic urban
legend are present, including absence of a definite source;
prima facie plausibility; and deep significance for those cir-
culating it--in this case, prominent members of the Anglo-
American Jewish communities who would appear to feel that
a royal tradition validates their own commitment to circum-
cision and confirms their status as respected insiders (Pfeffer,
2012). There is even an implicit moral: If circumcision is
good enough for the royal family, it is good enough for
everyone. Indeed, in a subsequent book Schoen suggests that
"universal newborn circumcision is becoming an achievable
goal," because the Chinese could simply order everyone to
be circumcised, and it would happen:
In China there is a powerful and increasingly prosperous central
government ruling 1.2 billion people, and once a decision is
made there is the will and the wherewithal to quickly and
decisively implement any circumcision program, whether
targeting high risk men or involving the entire population.
(Schoen, 2009, pp. 158, 154)
What is also interesting is that Schoen describes his source
as oral transmission and does not seem to be aware of another
printed source--a compendium of Jewish religious/lifestyle
practice compiled by Alfred Kolatch, published in 1981: "In
England, the Royal House has a long tradition requiring that
all royal male children be circumcised by the Jewish mohel
of London" (Kolatch, 1981, p. 16). In the second edition of
the book, published 14 years later, the passage is repeated
with significant additions:
In England, the Royal House has a long tradition, dating back to
Queen Victoria (1837-1901), requiring that all male children be
circumcised by the Jewish mohel of London. The tradition has
not been followed in recent decades, and the younger members
of the British royalty have not been circumcised. (Kolatch,
1995, p. 16)
Kolatch has now added the specification to Victoria, and
the qualification that the tradition has been abandoned "in
recent decades." There is no mention of any belief in Davidic
lineage or specifically of Diana and Princes William and
Harry--though that is what is presumably meant by the ref-
erence to the tradition having been abandoned. Again we can
observe the process by which a legend grows, as details aim-
ing to create verisimilitude are added: If a firm origin for the
tradition can be cited, it adds to the credibility of the claim.
The question now becomes the source of Rabbi Kolatch's
information. It may be that earlier published sources will
turn up, but since this is (so far) the earliest sighting of the
story in print, we may provisionally conclude that he heard
the story or was informed of it by letter, possibly by Sifman,
or by others with whom he had been in contact. Whatever the
source, the appearance of the story in a widely distributed
book facilitated its spread.
In this context, it is perhaps significant that the refer-
ence to Queen Victoria was not always on Professor
Morris's website, but was added some time after March 3,
1999 (Morris, 1999). It might be thought that Morris's
source was either Kolatch's book or Schoen's article, but
since the former does not mention the Davidic lineage and
it is our impression that Morris had not seen Schoen's arti-
cle until we drew it to his attention, it is more likely that it
was an internet source, such as the British page on Circlist.
com, a prominent pro-circumcision site. Although the cur-
rent iteration of the site (August 2013) does not mention
this version of the tradition, it did so in considerable detail
as early as 2004, as evidenced by a full text transcription of
Circlist's then British page, published by the magazine of
Brit-Am, a Zionist splinter group of the British-Israelite
movement (Brit-Am Now, 2004b). Among other novel
details, the then Circlist page asserted that Prince William
had recently been circumcised "at his request at a private
surgical clinic" and that Charles's younger brothers had
been circumcised by Snowman (a matter to which we shall
return). The same magazine had two issues earlier pro-
vided a link to the 1997 Schoen article (Brit-Am Now,
2004a) as republished on the website of a well-known New
York mohel (Shoulson, n.d.). It is thus evident that
Schoen's original article diffused rapidly among interested
parties, further mutating as it spread.

As for Morris, he now states that he believes the story to
be no more than folklore, but that he is impressed by recent
media reports that the tradition was initiated by George I. He
has foreshadowed further changes to the wording on his
website, confirming the malleability of these stories
(B. Morris, personal communication, August 5, 2013b).
Queen Victoria and Her Medical
Adviser
The second version of the myth, recounted in the American
pregnancy manual, is most likely a garbled version of the
first or a piece of creative reinvention on the part of the
authors, and thus not in need of any refutation. But let us take
it seriously for a moment and see where it leads us. The doc-
tor in question was presumably (Sir) James Clark (1788-
1870), appointed as physician to the Duchess of Kent in
1835, and who became Victoria's personal physician on her
accession to the throne. He had indeed traveled, but accord-
ing to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of Biography, only
to France, Italy (where he practiced for several years in
Rome, and treated the dying poet Keats), and later in
Germany. There is no mention of any trips to Africa or the
Middle East, and no suggestion that he had any interest in, or
had even heard of, circumcision. In reply to our request for a
source on the book's Facebook page, one of the authors
replied: "I read about six books on circumcision history for
that little part (ugh!), likely it is from one of them" (Jones,
2013). Uncertainty over sources did not stop the same author
joining the feeding frenzy that followed George's birth with
this July 23 tweet: "Fun fact: British heirs to the throne have
all been circumcised starting with Queen Victoria's sons, but
Diana refused to circumcise William or Harry" (Jones, 2013).
George I and the Hanoverians
Unlike the stories about Queen Victoria having initiated a
circumcision tradition, recent assertions that the practice
originated with the Hanoverians can be documented quite
exactly. The first appearance of the claim was on June 1,
2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz carried a feature
on the relationship between the royal family and British
Jewry that led off with the statement that Prince Charles had
been circumcised by Snowman, and then continued:
the fact that the delicate act was performed upon the royal
princes by a Jewish practitioner, a custom dating back to George
I, who brought it over from his native Hanover, has long been a
source of pride within the local community. (Pfeffer, 2012)
The apparent source for this claim was British historian
and journalist Professor Geoffrey Alderman who, the article
reveals, was also circumcised by Snowman.
This quite novel claim of Hanoverian origin for a royal
circumcision tradition would probably have slipped back
into well-deserved obscurity in the normal course of events;
what brought it into prominence was the announcement of
the pregnancy of the Duchess of Cambridge some 6 months
later. Searching for a new angle on this momentous event,
the London Evening Standard dug up the Hanoverian origin
and the Queen Victoria--Davidic lineage claims, and related
them sequentially as if they were seamlessly part of the same
story.
The so-called "tradition" only dates back to George I, who
imported the custom from his native Hanover. Queen Victoria,
convinced that the British royal family was descended from
King David, had all her male offspring circumcised. The
tradition continued through Edward VII, the Duke of Windsor
and Prince Charles, who was circumcised by Rabbi Jacob
Snowman at Buckingham Palace in 1948. His brothers Andrew
and Edward were also circumcised. (Anonymous, 2012)
The toothpaste was now well and truly out of the tube:
When the baby did in fact turn out to be a boy, there ensued
a tsunami of speculation about the fate of his foreskin, all
asserting the existence of a "tradition" whose supposed ori-
gin was either the Queen Victoria's beliefs about her ances-
try, or the Electors of Hanover or, in many cases, both.
Professor Alderman himself wrote an opinion piece for
Haaretz on the occasion of the birth in which he asserted
quite confidently: "It was also thanks to the Hanoverians that
the custom arose of having royal sons circumcised by Jewish
mohelim" (Alderman, 2013c), though in subsequent corre-
spondence with us he adopted a more guarded tone: "This
practice may have been introduced by George I, as I believe
the Electors of Hanover so practised" (G. Alderman, per-
sonal communication, August 4, 2013a; emphases added).
When asked for the source of this belief, he did not refer to
scholarly works or historical documents but to a private con-
versation: "I was told of the Hanoverians by the late
Dr. Cecil Roth (Bearsted Reader in Post-Biblical Jewish
History at Oxford), who taught me there (Oxford) in the
early 1960s. I will try and track down a reference for you"
(G. Alderman, personal communication, August 5, 2013b).
Roth (who died in 1970) was a distinguished scholar and
author of numerous books on the history of the Jewish peo-
ple, especially in England, but his publications do not sug-
gest that he had any special knowledge of the Hanoverians.
As editor of the Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (Roth, 1959),
he was in a position to ensure that this information was
included in the entries for circumcision, or England, or
Hanover, but neither of the first two mention Snowman,
Victoria or Prince Charles, and the last merely gives a brief
account of Jewish fortunes in that region (Roth, 1959). Nor is
there any mention of either the Queen Victoria or the George
I stories in the vast Encyclopedia Judaica of which Roth was
editor-in-chief, and for which he wrote the entry on Jewish
life in England (Roth, 1972). These silences could have sev-
eral explanations: Roth not believing such details to be
Darby and Cozijn 5
important enough to include, not feeling that they were suf-
ficiently documented, or lack of space; but the most likely
explanation is that the legend of a royal circumcision tradi-
tion had not yet coalesced and that the Hanoverians did not
circumcise their sons.
Even if Roth had told the young Geoffrey Alderman that
the Hanoverians did observe such a practice, a little reflec-
tion would have brought out the improbability of the sugges-
tion. The future George I was born in 1660; his father, the
Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, was not elevated to the cov-
eted position of prince-elector until 1698 but died before the
appointment became official. George I therefore became the
first installed Elector of Hanover 15 years after the birth of
his first and only son, born in Hanover in 1683, the future
George II (Weir, 1996, pp. 272-276). On the question of cir-
cumcision, therefore, it is difficult to see how the "Electors
of Hanover so practiced," and on whom, before their arrival
in England. As of this writing (September 15, 2013), despite
a considerable exchange of emails, Professor Alderman has
not produced any references for this improbable belief.
Given the marginal and often despised status of the Jews in
central Europe until the emancipation of the 19th century, it
appears incredible that a mohel or Jewish physician would
have been permitted to impose the distinctive mark of Jewish
identity on any Christian, let alone the members of a princely
house; and if it was a practice among the Hanoverians we
would expect the fact to be better documented than a hazy
recollection of what an elderly don said in conversation some
50 years ago. It seems extraordinary that a tenured professor
of history should make such a specific and unambiguous
empirical claim in public debate without having firm docu-
mentary proof.
The Lost Tribes and Prophecy
Given their evident falsity, why are these stories so readily
believed and so widely circulated? The answer lies partly in
their prima facie plausibility; partly in the glamour of royalty
and the popular obsession with celebrity; and partly in the
controversial status of circumcision--a hot topic in contem-
porary society. The factors giving the stories credibility were
(a) the reported circumcision of Prince Charles in 1948 and,
lying behind this, (b) the efforts of the British Israelites to
concoct an Israelite ancestry for the British race and a
Davidic lineage for the royal family.
To take the second point first, the Queen Victoria story
grew out of the efforts of an assortment of unstable "proph-
ets," culminating in the rise of the British Israelites as an
organized religious-political movement, to prove that the
British race was descended from the 10 lost tribes of Israel.
There is no detailed history of the British-Israel delusion,
but the major scholarly study by Tudor Parfitt traces the ori-
gins of the movement to the misery that accompanied the
early Industrial Revolution, the breakdown of traditional
agrarian society, and the Napoleonic wars (Parfitt, 2002).
The consequent rise of millenarian protest movements
spawned many self-proclaimed prophets, including Richard
Brothers (1754-1824), a discharged soldier, disappointed by
life and love; in his compensatory tract A Revealed
Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times (Brothers, 1794), he
asserted that the lost tribes of Israel had found their way to
Britain, and that he himself was a direct descendant of the
biblical King David, via James I. (This treasonous assertion
landed him in a lunatic asylum for the next 20 years.)
Brothers was followed by numerous imitators and would-
be cult leaders, such as Joanna Southcott, whose claim that
she was about to give birth to the Messiah drove the London
press into a fever of excitement nearly as great in 1814 as the
recent obsession with the fate of Prince George's penis.
Bitter was the disappointment when she died without having
given birth to anything. Then there was her disciple John
Wroe, a fanatical hunchback with pedophile tendencies
(according to Parfitt), who founded an ascetic cult that
adopted many Old Testament ritual practices, including
obligatory circumcision of converts and children. In 1824,
one of his followers was charged with manslaughter after a
boy whom he had circumcised in Bedford died from the
wound (Harrison, 1979, pp. 138-152). English Protestantism
had always shown a strong Old Testament consciousness,
and the Puritan sects, in particular, were fond of comparing
themselves with the Israelites held captive in Egypt. This
does not mean that there was any widespread adoption of
practices such as circumcision, but that biblical literalism,
especially in relation to the more apocalyptic passages of the
Old Testament, was common currency.
The British Israelites and Queen
Victoria
The text that the British Israelites came to regard as their
founding document was Our Israelitish Origin, by
John Wilson, the unemployed son of an Irish weaver. This
made no mention of ritual observances such as circumcision,
but sought to show that the Saxons were descended from the
lost tribes of Israel via certain Scythian peoples who had
found their way to north-west Europe (Wilson, 1840). Our
Israelitish Origin went through four editions in Wilson's life-
time and was quite widely read among the less educated sec-
tors of the public, and with variations and additions it became
canonical, but it made no mention of any Davidic origin of
the British monarchy. This notion--that the British monar-
chy was somehow descended directly from King David--
was not introduced until the 1860s, in England, the Remnant
of Judah and the Israel of Ephraim: The Two Families Under
One Head (Glover, 1861, 1881), by a former "chaplain to the
consulate in Cologne," Frederick Glover, and it was not until
the 1870s that the myth took its final, elaborated form in
J. C. Stevens' Genealogical Chart Showing the Connection
between the House of David and the Royal Family of Britain
(1877). Together with the wildly popular Twenty-Seven
6 SAGE Open
Identifications of the British Nation With Lost Israel by
Richard Hines (1871), these texts spurred the formation of
the British Israelites as an organized movement, with news-
letters, offices, meetings, and branches in other Anglo coun-
tries, including the United States.
Although British-Israelism (BI) had quite a large follow-
ing in the late 19th and early 20th century, the movement was
always a fringe preoccupation, rather less respectable than
scientology or belief in alien abductions today. The
Establishment held it in contempt, and the Church of England
(of which the English monarch is Supreme Governor) pub-
lished several condemnations of it as erroneous and even
heretical (Goudge, 1934). None of this has prevented the
most popular form of the circumcision myth having as its
central plank the claim that Queen Victoria was a convert to
BI, and particularly to belief in the direct Davidic lineage of
the English monarchy; and further that she therefore circum-
cised all her sons, starting with the future Edward VII (born
1841).
There are two immediate problems with these
propositions:
1. There is a conspicuous lack of evidence that Queen
Victoria ever adhered to any form of British-
Israelism. Although she wrote about 2,500 words a
day in her diaries throughout her adult life, purveyors
of the story have been unable to come up with a sin-
gle sentence in support of their claims. The fact that
one of her many granddaughters, Princess Alice,
Countess of Athlone, agreed to be a patron of the
main BI organization when it consolidated in 1920
tells us nothing about Victoria's own views. By that
time British-Israelism was associated with a range of
Empire unity movements, including Imperial
Federation and efforts at closer ties between Britain
and the United States--many of which had a White
supremacist and increasingly anti-Semitic flavor
(Parfitt, 2002).
2. There is no evidence that Edward VII or his younger
brothers were circumcised as infants or at any time in
later life.
But we can go further than the mere absence of evidence.
Although Wilson's founding text was published suggestively
close to Edward's birth, there are three fatal objections to
making a link between these two events:
·
· Wilson's "theory" rested on the proposition that "peo-
ple of Israel" now inhabiting northern Europe were
not Jews (whom he identified as the "people of
Judah"), but Gentiles--who did not, therefore, follow
Jewish ritual observances. It was a racial, not a cul-
tural, theory. Accordingly, it would have been as non-
sensical for Europeans to adopt circumcision as it
would be for them to stop eating bacon or to refrain
from work on Saturdays.
·
· Wilson did not expound, or even mention, anything
about the Davidic lineage of the monarchy until the
fifth edition, published posthumously in 1876. This
idea was introduced in Glover's book, not published
until 20 years after Edward's birth, and only became a
BI tenet in subsequent decades. In other words, even
if Victoria had fallen for the claim that she was
descended from King David, it could not have been
until long after her child-bearing years, when all her
male children were grown up and beyond her reach.
·
· Finally, there is the hemophilia factor--a rather
important medico-scientific fact that the mythmakers
entirely ignore. Victoria was a carrier of the fatal gene
(Potts & Potts, 1995), and her fourth and last son
(Leopold, born 1853) was hemophiliac. But since this
was not discovered until 1858 or 59, when he was 5 or
6, he clearly could not have been circumcised as an
infant; if he had been, the hemophilia would have
been discovered then. But if Leopold was not circum-
cised it is highly unlikely that any of his brothers
were.
The inescapable conclusion is that Victoria did not sub-
scribe to the myth of the royal family's descent from the
House of David, and did not have her sons circumcised. That
tenured professors at leading universities should repeat such
stories without verification is unfortunate, but is perhaps evi-
dence of how readily the admixture of blood rites and blood
royal can generate narrative. Although Morris presents the
story as an established fact, when first asked for a source he
replied, "I am sorry to say I have no reliable publication on
this" (B. Morris, personal communication, August 2, 2013c).
It is well known that Morris is a leading promoter of routine
infant circumcision as a "biomedical imperative for the 21st
century," and thus would be expected to have a certain inter-
est in maximizing the extent of the practice (Frisch, 2012;
Morris, 2007). Goldman's claims show all the signs of
extreme carelessness:Amohel who could circumcise Edward
VII (born 1841), the Duke of Windsor (i.e., his grandson,
Edward the abdicated, born 1894), and Prince Charles (born
1948) must have enjoyed remarkable longevity. Even so fer-
vent a believer as Professor Morris has never suggested that
the benefits of circumcision include a biblical life span.
The Prince and the Snowman
The other factor giving the Victoria and the George I stories
credibility was the reported circumcision of Prince Charles
by Dr. Jacob Snowman in December 1948. Although the
best-known evidence for this is an unsourced statement in
Anthony Holden's biography (Holden, 1979), it has not been
seriously questioned, and may be taken as fact.1 Charles thus
remains the only Royal for whom we have reliable evidence
of circumcision,2 but if he was circumcised it is possible that
his grandfather and great uncles (George VI, Edward VIII,
and the other sons of George V) were also done, and
Darby and Cozijn 7
conceivably some lesser royals and aristocrats, as reported
by Dr. Sifman. Although it did not reach its peak of popular-
ity until the 1920s, circumcision was coming into vogue
among the middle classes and those aspiring to middle class
respectability during the Edwardian period, and it is possible
that the royal doctors recommended the operation as the lat-
est medical advance available to the rich, assuring the anx-
ious parents that it was a sure preventive of such feared
problems as masturbation, phimosis, syphilis, and cancer.
But British doctors were not, on the whole, strongly in favor
of routine circumcision, often lacked confidence in their
ability to perform the surgery, and sometimes recommended
the traditional Jewish method as safer and neater than any-
thing a GP or surgeon could manage (Darby, 2005). In such
circumstances, an experienced mohel might well have been
seen as the first choice of a rich and well-connected parent. If
these operations were performed by mohelim who were also
leading physicians, that might explain why the palace called
upon Snowman in 1948.
An obituary of Snowman (1871-1959) states that his
reputation extended beyond the Jewish community and
reports, as a matter of pride, that "he was called upon for
the circumcision of members of the Royal Family and per-
formed the operation on Prince Charles" (Anonymous,
1959). But the fact that Charles was circumcised tells us
nothing about the fate of his own sons, and most commen-
tators agree (either sadly or gleefully, depending on their
perspective) that William and Harry were spared. It is often
stated (e.g., by the Evening Standard article referenced
above) that Charles's brothers (Andrew, born 1960, and
Edward, born 1964) were also circumcised; if so, it was not
by Snowman, who died in 1959.
Urban Legends, Myths, and Factoids
Although the myth of the royal family's circumcision tradi-
tion is of recent invention, the process by which the narra-
tives developed will be better understood if we briefly
consider the differing shades of meaning conveyed by the
terms urban myth, urban legend, contemporary legend and
factoid. Following Jan Brunvand (1981), Wikipedia usefully
summarizes an urban legend, urban myth, urban tale, or con-
temporary legend as
a form of modern folklore consisting of stories that may or
may not have been believed by their tellers to be true. As with
all folklore and mythology, the designation suggests nothing
about the story's veracity, but merely that it is in circulation,
exhibits variation over time, and carries some significance that
motivates the community in preserving and propagating it.
(Wikipedia, 2013)
Such stories usually emerge through oral transmission
and can rarely be traced to an original source. Brunvand
notes that such items of folklore retain a central core yet
constantly change as they are transmitted, thus creating
numerous variants that differ in length, detail, and style. He
prefers to call modern stories of this type legends rather than
myth so as to indicate that they involve real people rather
than gods or monsters, are widely believed (or are at least
believable), and that they thus represent a kind of "quasi-
history." Tales with relatively recent or modern origins now
tend to be referred to as contemporary legends (Dégh, 1991;
Simpson, 1998). Significantly for our purposes, Brunvand
(1981) points out that in order to flourish, such stories "must
fill some genuine need," such as "an entertaining escape
from reality, or a desire to validate by anecdotal examples
some of the culture's ideals and institutions" (pp. 3-12). Both
these needs were met by the story of the royal family's cir-
cumcision habit.
A factoid is a questionable or spurious (unverified, false,
or fabricated) statement presented as a fact, but without sup-
porting evidence. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
factoid as "something that becomes accepted as a fact,
although it is not (or may not be) true; spec. an assumption or
speculation reported and repeated so often that it is popularly
considered true; a simulated or imagined fact," and refers to
Norman Mailer's definition in his biography of Marilyn
Monroe: "facts which have no existence before appearing in
a magazine or newspaper, creations which are not so much
lies as a product to manipulate emotion in the Silent
Majority." A number of such factoids have been collected by
medical historian Lesley Hall, such as the Victorian mother's
advice on her daughter's wedding night: "Just lie back, dear,
and think of England (or Britain)," variously attributed to a
(nonexistent) Lady Hillingham or to Queen Victoria herself,
and supposedly emblematic of Victorian attitudes to sex
(Hall, n.d.). An even more relevant example is the story that
a style of penis piercing/infibulation known as a Prince
Albert was so named because Prince Albert had one, either
because he wanted to hide the bulge in his trousers or (even
less plausibly) because Queen Victoria did not like his penis
and (by some twisted logic) imagined that such an installa-
tion would make it less noticeable. It is now accepted that the
term was invented by Doug Molloy, a Californian body arts
practitioner, in the 1970s (Ferguson, 1999).
It may now be seen that the royal family's "circumcision
tradition" exhibits all the characteristics of a classic urban
myth or legend: absence of evidence, uncertain origin, varia-
tion on a set of basic themes, change over time and signifi-
cance to those who circulate it. Not being anchored in
evidence or any factual base, the story is free to grow and
mutate as the fancy of its numerous re-tellers dictates; in the
age of social media and the blogosphere, their capacity for
rapid evolution is vastly enhanced. The discrete elements
(such as Queen Victoria believing herself to be descended
from King David; or that the Electors of Hanover circum-
cised their sons) may be regarded as factoids, while the
mutating narrative as a whole may be seen as a contemporary
legend. A perfect example is provided in the explanation for
8 SAGE Open
the sudden surge of interest in Prince George's penis given in
an interview by royal watcher and editor of the Kensington
& Chelsea Review, Coco Khan, to an enthralled American
audience:
It's actually a little bit of a sort of a falsity that's going around.
I mean they haven't been circumcising very long, it's only been,
it's a tradition that's about 150 years old, and by British standards
150 years old isn't a tradition. It started with George I, who,
well, he started it off, and then it was carried on by Victoria, who
was obviously one of our most influential monarchs, and she
basically got it into her head that her children were the sons of
David. So, I'm not entirely sure she made that decision in, you
know, out of a sense of science, but that was carried on and then
Diana put a stop to it. So it's very unlikely we're going to be
seeing it [a circumcision] this time around. (Khan, 2013)
The key elements of the story are here, embedded in the
usual anecdotal style (well, you know, basically, etc.), and
combined with a striking absence of evidence and a very
hazy sense of history: 150 years would take us back to the
1860s and the middle of Victoria's long reign (but well after
the birth of her last male child, Prince Leopold, in 1853). As
for George I, he was born in 1660 and ascended to the English
throne in 1714--all of 300 years ago. The Americans' evi-
dent fascination with the story expresses their obsession with
circumcision and the glamour that the English monarchy
holds for their ritual-hungry public and their increasingly
dynastic political elite (Kelley, 1997).
Evolution of a Contemporary Legend
We are now in a position to see how the Queen Victoria leg-
end emerged and grew. The core of fact around which it
accreted was Snowman's circumcision of Prince Charles and
possibly some other members of the royal family, identities
unknown; the rest is creative inflation, deriving largely from
stories told and transmitted informally among elite members
of the Jewish community, beginning with Snowman himself.
As Alderman commented, the Jewish community in England
has always taken considerable pride in Snowman's royal
role, and it is natural that some might wish to give it a deeper
historical pedigree. It is perhaps significant that Alderman
and Harry Wallop, writing in the Daily Telegraph (Wallop,
2013), felt moved to mention, and were evidently proud of,
the fact that they, too, were circumcised by the same operator
who had done the future Prince of Wales. In the immediate
aftermath of this notable procedure, however, there was
nothing in print and probably nothing in writing about a "tra-
dition." Yet Snowman must have been pleased about the
royal patronage and did not keep it secret; he told his friends
and associates, they told their friends, and as the information
passed by word of mouth or personal letter, the message
became distorted, details were added, and exaggeration
occurred. After Snowman's death in 1959, the story
circulated for about 20 years within the Anglo-American
Jewish communities before emerging in print, in Kolatch's
book of 1981--ample gestation time for one mohel's cir-
cumcision of a few royals to become "a long tradition requir-
ing that all royal male children be circumcised by the Jewish
mohel of London." A few years later, following the birth of
Princes William and Harry, but without any explanation, the
tradition is sourced to Queen Victoria--possibly because the
author has a dim awareness of the British Israelite contribu-
tion, or perhaps for no reason other than a desire to give the
story more depth and thus credibility. By the 1980s, it was
received wisdom that the Victorian age was antisex, and well
known that late 19th century doctors favored circumcision
as a means of discouraging masturbation (Darby, 2005,
chap. 9). That being the case, it might be thought natural that
Victoria had also favored it back in the 1840s.
Yet even by 1995, circulation of the story is still fairly
limited, largely confined to Jewish circles; the bridge from
there to the wider society is provided by Edgar Schoen, first
in his 1997 article, and for a broader audience in his book on
circumcision published in 2005. Once Schoen had put the
new amalgam into print, the stories spread fast, for he was a
prolific contributor to medical and other journals, and promi-
nent asAmerica's most determined advocate of routine infant
circumcision. In addition, we had arrived at the age of the
internet, meaning that information was now disseminated
more rapidly and more widely than ever before. As soon as
the story appeared on websites, it was there for journalists,
op-ed writers, and anybody else using search engines to find,
and without anyone taking the trouble to investigate, it
became accepted as a historical truth. It is unclear who first
conjured up the motivation for Victoria's "decision" in the
form of an illusory belief in her Davidic lineage, except that
the first published sighting is Schoen's 1997 article and, as
he said in his correspondence with us, "it makes sense to
me."
Conclusion
It is thus clear that there is no tradition of circumcision
among the British royal family. If Prince Charles and the
sons of George V were circumcised, it was not because
Victoria believed herself descended from King David, and
certainly not because a family circumcision tradition was
introduced by George I. If Snowman or another practitioner
performed the operation on them it was because circumci-
sion was a common practice among the British middle and
wealthy classes from the 1890s to the 1940s, widely recom-
mended as a sensible hygienic precaution, and the monarchy
was following middle class fashion and the prevailing medi-
cal wisdom. That the palace doctors were able to call upon
the services of so distinguished a surgeon is not evidence of
any tradition, but simply another instance of the royal fami-
ly's privileged status.

Notes
1. In support of Holden's account, there is a press report from
1948 reproduced on several websites, which reads as fol-
lows: "London (JTA)--Crown Prince Charles, son of Princess
Elizabeth and heir to the British throne, was circumcised in
Buckingham Palace by Rev. Jacob Snowman, official Mohel
of the London Jewish community, the Mizrachi News Bureau
reported. Rev. Snowman, who is a noted Jewish scholar spe-
cializing in the poetry of Bialik, has been ritual circumciser
in London for many years" (I. J. Barzak, personal commu-
nication, n.d.). The Jewish Telegraphic Agency is unable to
ascertain in which newspapers this dispatch appeared, but the
consensus is that it appears to be authentic (A. Soclof, personal
communication, August 27, 2013).
2. A partial exception is Alfonso, first son of Alfonso III, King
of Spain and Victoria's grand daughter, Victoria Eugenia. But
since he proved to be hemophiliac and nearly died when he
was circumcised, it seems unlikely that his younger brothers
were so treated (Potts & Potts, 1995, p. 144 et seq.).
