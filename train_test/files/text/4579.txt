On pain of the Myth of the Given, capacities that belong to the
higher cognitive faculty must be operative in experience.
John McDowell (2009a, 2009b)
To avoid this foundationalism . . . contemporary pragmatists
who are eager to revive the concept of experience must be on
guard to not treat experience as a kind of ultimate given-ness
against which we might be able to measure our truth claims.

Introduction
In the past few years, a small but intense debate has trans-
pired on the margins of mainstream scholarship in the disci-
pline of Philosophy, particularly within the tradition known
as American pragmatism. While most philosophical pragma-
tists struggle with questions about how ideas might improve
experience (or the theory­practice continuum), those schol-
ars participating in this exchange have shown greater con-
cern for an issue that is, at its core, a theoretical matter: Does
the theory of experience espoused by the classic American
philosopher John Dewey succumb to what contemporary
analytic philosophers--for instance, Wilfred Sellars, Donald
Davidson and John McDowell--call the Myth of the Given?
One commentator, Scott Aikin (2007, 2009), claims that
Dewey relied on noninferential and nonconceptual content
or givens as perceptual inputs for cognitive experience. The
upshot of Aikin's objection is that these experiential givens
constitute a proxy epistemological foundation for the beliefs
that flow from inquiry--a position clearly in conflict with
Dewey's commitment to antifoundationalism. The objection
assumes a slightly different form in the hands of another
scholar of American pragmatism, Colin Koopman (2009),
who insists that invoking experience as an ultimate arbiter of
truthfulness or moral value prevents Dewey from "seeing
himself all the way clear of the givenism he was so careful to
avoid in some forms" (p. 84). Contemporary Dewey scholars
(hereafter "Deweyans") who appeal to experiential givens
risk resurrecting those same empiricist foundations that
Dewey emphatically rejected, but sometimes lapsed into--
foundations that would undermine the entire pragmatist proj-
ect of philosophical reconstruction. David Hildebrand and
Gregory Pappas (2010) respond to Koopman's objection

Taking Experiential Givenism Seriously
Shane J. Ralston1
Abstract
In the past few years, a small but intense debate has transpired on the margins of mainstream scholarship in the discipline
of Philosophy, particularly within the subfield of American pragmatism. While most philosophical pragmatists dedicate their
attention to questions concerning how ideas improve experience (or the theory­practice continuum), those participating in
this exchange have shown greater concern for an issue that is, at its core, a theoretical matter: Does the theory of experience
espoused by the classic American philosopher John Dewey succumb to what contemporary analytic philosophers--for
instance, Wilfred Sellars, Donald Davidson, and John McDowell--call the Myth of the Given? One commentator, Scott
Aikin, claims that Dewey relied on noninferential and nonconceptual content or givens as perceptual inputs for cognitive
experience. The upshot of Aikin's objection is that these experiential givens constitute a proxy epistemological foundation
for the beliefs that flow from inquiry--a position clearly in conflict with Dewey's commitment to antifoundationalism. The
objection assumes a slightly different form in the hands of another scholar of American pragmatism, Colin Koopman. Gregory
Pappas and David Hildebrand respond to Koopman's version of the objection. The goals of this article are to clarify the
objection, highlight the stakes in the debate, identify misunderstandings of Dewey's experiential metaphysics on both sides,
and determine why the experiential givenism objection merits serious philosophical scrutiny in the future.

with disbelief, noting that the Myth of the Given only applies
to those knowledge claims that we would associate with
epistemology proper, not the kind of noncognitive or primary
experience so central to Dewey's naturalistic metaphysics.
The goals of this article are to clarify the objection, highlight
the stakes in the debate, identify misunderstandings of
Dewey's experiential metaphysics on both sides, and deter-
mine why the experiential givenism objection merits serious
philosophical scrutiny.
The article is organized as follows. The majority of the
next section addresses what the "Myth of the Given" is, the
ways in which it was formulated by analytic philosophers
and, briefly, how it relates to philosophical pragmatism. In the
following section "The Experiential Givenism Debate," the
debate over experiential givenism--a debate mainly between
pragmatists--receives closer scrutiny, including accounts of
the two main positions. The section "Dewey on Qualitative
Thought" relies on a careful reading of Dewey's essay
"Qualitative Thought" to suggest the possibility that experi-
ence is phenomenologically, not empirically, given. In the
section "Johnson on Embodied Cognition," a more precise
phenomenological account of Dewey's theory of experience
surfaces in Mark Johnson's notion of embodied cognition.
"Misunderstanding Dewey's Experiential Metaphysics"
reveals how several participants in the debate misunderstand
Dewey's theory of experience. The concluding section
addresses the debate's implications and why we might wish to
take it more seriously.
What is the Myth of the Given?
While most (if not all) analytic philosophers believe that the
Myth of the Given is a genuine philosophical problem, very
few continental philosophers and pragmatists share their
concern. Still, due to the ability of pragmatist ideas to cross,
fuse, preserve, and influence multiple traditions--what
Joseph Margolis (2010) calls "pragmatism's advantage"
(p. 1)--it is perhaps unsurprising that analytic pragmatists
would attempt to square the Myth of the Given with pragma-
tist theories of experience (Ralston, 2011). In this way, the
experiential givenism debate represents a vital link between
the parallel traditions of analytic philosophy and pragma-
tism. I first briefly address the Myth of the Given exchange
in the analytic philosophy literature before moving to the
parallel debate in the pragmatist literature. My account of the
Myth of the Given debates in analytic philosophy is not
intended to be exhaustive. The extant literature on this topic
is far too extensive to completely summarize here. Instead,
mine is a synoptic account meant only to shed light on the
experiential givenism debate in the pragmatist literature.
Imagine you are standing in an amphitheater and sus-
pended above your head is a large green translucent cube.
When you look up to observe the cube, you have a specific
visual experience. Call this experience E. For clarity, think of
E as having a list of phenomenal properties that compose its
sensible/perceptual (or if you are a Kantian, intuitional) con-
tent: phenomenal property GREEN, phenomenal property
LARGE, phenomenal property TRANSLUCENT, phenom-
enal property CUBISH, and so on and so forth. Traditional
empiricists appreciate experiences such as E as the ultimate
font of empirical knowledge. When a human observer has an
E, she will typically form the belief that there exists a large
translucent green cube above her. Why is this? There are two
mental events and an inferential pattern at work here; experi-
ence E and belief B, such that an experience with the same
set of phenomenal properties, that is, the same sensible/per-
ceptual content, results in the same belief about that content.
If the belief is put in form "That is a large translucent green
cube up there," then it has propositional content too.
One view (often ascribed to Donald Davidson) is that
having some direct or nonconceptually mediated awareness
of perceptual content, in this case E, simply causes a concep-
tual belief, in this case B. However, this view is problematic,
as "it is a. . . Myth to think [that] sensibility by itself, without
any involvement of capacities that belong to our rationality,
can make things available for our cognition" (McDowell,
2009a, p. 2). Wilfrid Sellars's (1963) solution is to substitute
warrant for descriptive causation: "[W]e are not giving an
empirical description . . . [but] we are placing it [the percep-
tual content] in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and
being able to justify what one says" (p. 169). Sellars con-
ceives the relation between experience E and belief B not as
one of causation, but of justification "in the logical space of
reasons" (Calcaterra, 2011, p. xix). However, the objection
to Sellars' account (often ascribed to John McDowell) is that
perceptual experience is not thoroughly nonconceptual and
noninferential content, subsequently carved up in a "space of
reasons." Hence, it is not made ready to receive conceptual
content vis-à-vis the observing agent's cognition; rather,
experience comes to the agent with conceptual content
already there. To appreciate the lesson of Immanuel Kant's
(1929) Critique of Pure Reason, "Thought without content is
empty, intuitions without content are blind" (p. 93).
Understanding involves the synthesis of intuitions and con-
cepts, not intuitions alone. To claim that perceptual content is
nonconceptual and thus experientially given, McDowell
(2004) asserts, is to accept that "the space of reasons is . . .
more extensive than the space of concepts" (p. 6). Surely this
view is wrong, though, for concepts prefigure reasons. So, to
preserve the reason-giving relation between E and B, experi-
ence must first be conceptually articulated, just as beliefs
are.1
One mistaken assumption is that givenism is identical to
foundationalism. However, the two, while related, are never-
theless distinguishable. Whereas foundationalism structures
the epistemic warrant for beliefs in terms of some noninfer-
entially justified foundation (i.e., a basic or foundational
belief), givenism points to the origin of the warrant as non-
conceptual, noninferential content offering an "autonomous
source of reasons" (Aikin, 2009, pp. 19-20). Moreover,
Ralston 3
experiential givenism, though perfectly consistent with
empiricist foundationalism, does not necessarily entail that
same foundationalism.According to McDowell (2004), if we
are to understand experience as "a tribunal, mediating the
way our thinking is answerable to how things area," then
how we determine the ways in which experience is tribunal-
like depends on what is meant by the term experience, not
foundations (p. xii; Houser, 2011, p. 65). For pragmatists,
though, the worry is that by appealing to experience as the
ultimate arbiter of epistemic claims, they are invoking expe-
rience as a primordial given, grounding knowledge on expe-
riential foundations. Thus, their appeals to experience qua
given are incompatible with their professed antifoundation-
alism (Margolis, 1984; Rorty, 1979; Rosenbaum, 2002).
The Experiential Givenism Debate
Although dispute over the Myth of the Given emerged in a
vibrant exchange between analytic philosophers, including
Wilfred Sellars (1963, 1997), John McDowell (2004,
2009a, 2009b), and Donald Davidson (1983), it has since
crossed over to another philosophical tradition: American
pragmatism. In this new domain, what has ensued is a
smaller, though no less heated, debate between a select
group of classical pragmatist and neo-pragmatist scholars.
Classical pragmatists are those scholars who see them-
selves as expounding and extending the views of pragma-
tist figures such as William James, John Dewey and Charles
Sanders Peirce, while neo-pragmatists have developed
more syncretic forms of pragmatism (usually joined with
strands of continental, analytic, and postmodernist philoso-
phy). In "Pragmatism, Experience, and the Given," Scott
Aikin (2009) contends that Dewey's experiential metaphys-
ics invokes a noninferential, nonconceptual given, namely,
the notion of experience itself. He isolates a single passage
in Dewey's oeuvre to demonstrate that the distinction
between an empiricist and pragmatist theory of experience
is one of degree, not kind:
Empiricism is conceived as tied up with what has been, or is
"given." But experience in its vital form is experimental, an
effort to change the given; it is characterized by projection, by
reaching forward into the unknown; connection with the future
is the "salient trait." (MW 10:6; cited in Aikin, 2009, p. 24)2
While empiricists such as David Hume focus on "what we
can understand in terms of the given," pragmatists such as
John Dewey emphasize "how it [the given] can be put to use"
(Aikin, 2009, p. 24). The difference is between sensible con-
tent that updates our beliefs and sensible content that updates
our beliefs for a specific purpose. On the pragmatist account,
that purpose is use. Pragmatism is, then, only one step
removed from empiricism in its treatment of experience as
initially given. As Dewey denies that experience is "exclu-
sively a knowledge affair," Aikin (2009) reminds his reader
that it "is at least partially a knowledge affair, and the DG
[Doctrine of the Given] is an explanation of how that is so"
(p. 24). The pragmatist emulates the empiricist, assuming
that nonconceptual and noninferential perceptual content,
that is, givens, are raw material for an agent's cognition,
from which she draws inferences and carves up experience
into increasingly complex conceptual and propositional con-
tent. The claim that experience is shot through with givens in
this sense is, of course, a myth. As McDowell demonstrates,
experience already comes to us flush with its own conceptual
content. So, Aikin (2009) concludes that Dewey and some
Deweyans fall into the trap of experiential givenism and
foundationalism when they appeal to experience as ground-
ing further knowledge claims and beliefs (e.g., "experience
teaches us such-and-such") as well as "some non-inferential
cognitive input . . . necessary for inquiry" (p. 24).
Colin Koopman's version of the experiential givenism
objection, while similar to Aikin's, is more sweeping in its
scope. Pragmatism scholars lean heavily on experience that
is had or felt (precognitively) as a justification for epistemic
and moral claims resulting from rigorous inquiry. By choos-
ing a nonconceptual ground (experience) for a knowledge-
generating process (inquiry), they inadvertently succumb to
the Myth of the Given. According to Koopman (2009), this is
unsurprising, as John Dewey was prone to the same mistake.
The essay that demonstrates Dewey's flirtation with experi-
ential givenism is his 1915 "The Logic of Judgments of
Practice" (pp. 83-84). While Dewey initially argues against
the possibility of immediate perceptual experience, he even-
tually lapses into talk of perceptual givens available for
agents to take or select for use in cognition. Admittedly,
Dewey's notions of experience and inquiry were somewhat
inchoate in this early essay. Still, Koopman warns, "given-
ism could creep back into Dewey's theory of knowledge by
way of his conception of those initial indeterminacies that in
his mature epistemology and logic play the role of motiva-
tors for inquiry" (p. 84). When classical pragmatists build
Dewey's metaphysics of experience on the stilts of experien-
tial givens, it is nearly identical to placing it on empiricist
foundations. In Koopman's words, it involves "put[ting]
forth their metaphysics in the wrong kind of way, such that
their metaphysics resembles first philosophy more than it
resembles a postulated tool of inquiry" (p. 83). Not only does
the positing of experiential givens conflict with classical
pragmatists' antifoundationalism, but it also, and more dev-
astatingly, undermines the entire pragmatist project of recon-
structing philosophy as a historicist and meliorist enterprise.
In the shadow of experiential givenism and empiricist foun-
dationalism, pragmatist philosophy reverts to the same
"quest for certainty" that Dewey so staunchly opposed.
To date, only two Dewey scholars, David Hildebrand and
Gregory Pappas, have responded to Koopman's experiential
givenism objection. While it is far from complete, their
review of Koopman's book suggests some possible strategies
for articulating a more comprehensive response. Hildebrand
4 SAGE Open
and Pappas (2010) summarize Koopman's objection as fol-
lows: "The charge against CPs [Classic Pragmatists] like
Dewey was that their use . . . of experience . . . encouraged
them toward tacit acceptance of the trans-experiential
`Given' which Wilfrid Sellars warned about." Instead of an
original objection, they see it as a resuscitated or "repurposed
. . . charge" that Richard Rorty made "against Dewey"
brought to bear "against CP [Classical Pragmatism] in gen-
eral" (p. 3).3 For Hildebrand and Pappas, the objection draws
battle-lines between classical pragmatists, who lean heavily
on Dewey's unifying notion of experience, and neo-pragma-
tists, who are moved instead by more variegated appeals to
language, culture, and discourse. However, the experiential
givenism objection is clearly misdirected, they contend, as
no conclusive textual proof of givenism or foundationalism
can be detected in Dewey's oeuvre. Moreover, Sellars's
Myth of the Given implicates knowing (or in Aikin's words
"a knowing affair"), not experiencing (in Dewey's more
totalizing sense):
[T]he target of Sellar's [sic] critique is a certain conception of
knowledge--experience in the modern sense; but this is not
"experience" in Dewey's dominant sense, namely, the best
methodological starting point for a melioristic philosophy in a
processual world. (p. 5)
Experience (or lived experience) offers agents a practical
"starting point" from which to launch inquiries, solve prob-
lems, and improve life's conditions, as well as a point to
return to in a "processual world" of what Dewey called
"doing and undergoing." While Hildebrand and Pappas's
reply to Koopman clarifies the two positions in the experien-
tial givenism debate, it only travels parts of the journey
toward offering a full account of Dewey's experiential meta-
physics, let alone one that repels the experiential givenism
objection.
Dewey on Qualitative Thought
One of the best single writings illustrating the technical nature
of John Dewey's (1996) theory of experience is his 1930
essay "Qualitative Thought" (LW 5:243-261). In contrast to
the empiricism espoused by many early analytic philoso-
phers, human experience does not begin with the reception of
sensible impressions, sense data, or other atomistic elements
in the experienced world, but comes to us in full bloom as
qualities initially felt or had in a "situation" and later selected
and determined as "objects in thought" (Dewey, 1996, LW
5:246). Throughout the history of philosophy, qualities have
been relegated to a lower station relative to objects, concepts,
and classes, whether properties of mind-independent objects
(in realist metaphysics), predicates of actual or formal con-
cepts (in Aristotelian and formal logic), or characteristics of
classes (in set theory). Objects, concepts, and classes are dis-
tinctive and objectively quantifiable, whereas qualities are
vague and only subjectively appreciated. However, as Dewey
(1996) observes in his "stoical red Indian" example, the for-
mer fail to capture the experiential richness of phenomena:
Take the proposition: "The red Indian is stoical." This is
interpreted either as signifying that the Indian in question is
characterized by the property of stoicism in addition to that of
redness, or that he belongs to the class of stoical objects. The
ordinary direct sense of the proposition escapes recognition in
either case. For this sense expresses the fact that the indigenous
American was permeated throughout by a certain quality, instead
of being an object possessing a certain quality along with others.
He lived, acted, endured stoically (LW 2:244).
According to Dewey, the experience of the stoic Native
American is permeated through and through by a certain felt
quality that is had prior to being selected, determined, and
cognized. The experience occurs within the context of a situ-
ation, or "a complex existence that is held together in spite of
its internal complexity by the fact that it is dominated and
characterized by a single quality" (LW 5:246). The single
pervasive quality is a quality of the total situation, not of the
selected object. In contrast, the analytic philosopher under-
stands the agent as having experience E, of which its phe-
nomenal properties are Red, Indian, and Stoical. As the
properties Indian and Stoical would, in all likelihood, be
reducible to another set of more basic sensible properties, let
us consider just the single phenomenal property of Red. In
scientific parlance, the retinal and neuronal patterns indicate
to the perceiver that the object is red. In the language of rep-
resentationalist epistemology, the Red sense data or sense
impression inside my head corresponds to the red object in
the external world. However, the ordinary experience of the
stoic Native American in its qualitative wholeness eludes
detection, as the decomposed or analyzed experience cannot
do justice to the experience that "[h]e lived, acted, endured
stoically" (Dewey, 1996, LW 5:244).
How does Dewey's essay speak to the experiential given-
ism objection? In short, Dewey believes that the primary rea-
son analytic philosophers mistake the quality of a situation
for a property of an object is that they subscribe to a very
limited "subject-predicate theory of propositions" (LW
5:245). Critically important for this theory is the idea that the
"subject is `given'--ultimately apart from thinking--and
then thought adds to what is given a further determination or
else assigns it to a ready-made class of things" (LW 5:245).
Predication and classification are cognitive operations per-
formed (or added) to a perceived object--once converted
into the subject of a proposition, but initially outside the
bounds of thought (i.e., nonconceptual). The simplest cri-
tique of this propositional theory of knowledge is that not all
experience involves cognition. Some experiences are felt or
had, not analyzed, or known. The more complex and forceful
criticism is that the attribution of properties to objects in the
absence any consideration for the quality of the total situa-
tion mistakes propositional knowledge for the method by
Ralston 5
which it is obtained. The proposition is not given prior to
thought (i.e., nonconceptually) as a sensible object of experi-
ence. Instead, the proposition is the outcome of inquiry, the
result of selecting, determining, attributing, predicating, and
classifying objects only after initially experiencing the situa-
tion permeated throughout by a certain quality. Appreciating
experience as an assembly of preexisting objects to which
agents attach phenomenal properties, as many analytic phi-
losophers do, involves positing a given (or subject of propo-
sitional knowledge) and thereby ignoring the qualitatively
rich background against which cognitive operations occur.
Dewey's (1996) point is that,
the selective determination and relation of objects is controlled
by reference to a situation--to that which is constituted by a
pervasive and internally integrating quality, so that failure to
acknowledge the situation leaves, in the end, the logical force of
objects and their relations inexplicable. (LW 5:246)
The problem of given-ness, according to Dewey (1996),
lies not in the qualitatively rich experience that we initially
feel or have in a "situation" and later select and determine as
"objects in thought" and inquiry (LW 5:246). Rather, it lies in
the faulty assumption that experience lacks these pervasive
qualities, except insofar as we intellectually convert percep-
tual content into propositional form, attribute properties, and
thereby transform that content into proper objects of knowl-
edge. Therefore, the way in which Sellars frames the Myth of
the Given, i.e., as a problem of how to ground knowledge in
empirically present, nonconceptual content, falls prey to
Dewey's charge of given-ness (or version of the Myth of the
Given), for it neglects the felt quality of the total situation out
of which sensible content is only later discriminated.
Johnson on Embodied Cognition
While the strength of Dewey's metaphysics resides in its
ability to capture the qualitative immediacy of what is gener-
ically referred to as experience, it might appear weak as a
factual-scientific explanation of embodied cognition. Mark
Johnson addresses this shortcoming in his work on how cog-
nitive science and neuroscience support Dewey's theory of
experience.
In Experience and Nature, Dewey argued for an emergent
concept of mind, or what he calls "body-mind," whereby antic-
ipating future contingencies involves a reciprocal dance
between brain, body, and nervous system, not merely conscious
control over actions. For Dewey (1996), "body-mind" is
what actually takes place when a living body is implicated in
situations [. . . where] "body" designates the continued and
conserved, the registered and cumulative operation of factors
continuous with the rest of nature, inanimate as well as animate;
while "mind" designates the characters and consequences which
are differential, indicative of features which emerge when
"body" is engaged in a wider, more complex and interdependent
situation. (LW 1:285)
Furthermore, he claims that,
when locomotor organs are accompanied by distance receptors,
response to the distant in space becomes increasingly prepotent
and equivalent in effect to response to the future in time. A
response toward what is in the future is in effect a prediction of
a later contact. (LW 1:197)
Consciousness for Dewey is the capacity for judgment
formation. Dewey's emergent theory of mind was not the
product of armchair philosophizing, but the result of care-
fully translating research by members of theAmerican school
of neurology, includingAdolf M. Child, C. L. Herrick, Henry
Donaldson, and Frederick Tilney, into terms suitable for a lay
audience (Dalton, 2002, p. 11). Unsurprisingly, more recent
advances in neurological and cognitive science research
have superseded these findings. Nevertheless, Johnson
(2007) argues that recent studies, especially on brain archi-
tecture, "make sense of Dewey's claim that our experience
always begins with a pervasive unifying quality of a whole
situation, within which we then discriminate objects, with
their properties and relations to each other" (p. 100).
Johnson's best evidence that brain science supports
Dewey's theory of experience comes from the work of cog-
nitive neuroscientist Don Tucker. Tucker examines the archi-
tecture of the brain, noticing that there is a "core-shell
structure" that supports a "higher" level capacity to think
conceptually as well as "lower" level abilities to feel and
monitor. Johnson (2007) explains,
To vastly oversimplify, our brain developed through evolution
by adding new structures and layers on top of more primitive
parts shared with some other animals. The present-day result is
a brain with core limbic structures (mostly responsible for
body monitoring, motivation, emotions, and feelings) that are
connected to "higher" cortical layers that have ever more
differentiated functions, such as perception, body movement,
action planning, and reasoning. One striking feature of this
core-shell organization is that structures in the core regions are
massively interconnected, whereas structures in the shell are
sparsely interconnected. An important consequence of this is
that there is more functional differentiation and more
modularity of brain areas in the cortical shell than in the limbic
core. (p. 100)
Organisms with this more evolved brain architecture can
select, distinguish, and analyze objects, signify the meanings
of concepts, and make inferential leaps, relying on the brain's
cortical shell, once they have felt (or had) an experience of
the qualitatively whole situation, relying on the brain's lim-
bic core. Shifting between core limbic structures to shell cor-
tical structures, the outcome is a two-level "core-to-shell
movement of cognition" from detecting a single pervasive
6 SAGE Open
quality in the situation to engaging in more advanced opera-
tions, such as conceptual thinking and ratiocination (p. 101).
As an outgrowth of this highly evolved brain architec-
ture, sensorimotor trends structure the ways in which body-
minds encounter environments, physically and conceptually.
In what Johnson (2007) calls "image schemas," we can iden-
tify "dynamic, recurring pattern[s] of organism-environment
interactions" (p. 136). Our bodily architecture allows us to
view objects in certain ways and then to extend these into
higher level concepts and even inferences. For instance, the
"CONTAINER image schema" permits us to conceive an
object as being in another object, whether a fly in a bottle or
a brain in a body (p. 139). Likewise, the "SOURCE-PATH-
GOAL" schema allows agents to understand progression
from an origin along a route as an advance toward the objec-
tive.As image schemas press the limits of our combined brain
architecture and perceptual fields, they are neither restricted
to the mind or the body; they implicate both. By synthesizing
image schemas, Johnson notes, it is possible to understand
more complex linguistic operations (e.g., into combines
CONTAINER and SOURCE-PATH schema) and inferences
(such as transitivity through double CONTAINMENT; pp.
139, 142).
What Johnson offers is no less than credible scientific
support for Dewey's theory of experience. Recent studies on
brain architecture and function substantiate Dewey's account
of how experience ebbs and flow between its primary and
secondary phases.
Misunderstanding Dewey's Experiential
Metaphysics
Having presented the Myth of the Given, the experiential
givenism debate, one of Dewey's best explanations of his
theory of experience and Johnson's evidence that the theory
is scientifically warranted, I would like to return to the expe-
riential givenism debate with the express purpose of identi-
fying some critical mistakes on both sides. My intention is
not to resolve the issue. Nor is it to defend classic pragma-
tists or Deweyans against neo-pragmatists. Instead, it is to
provide a robust account of Dewey's metaphysics of experi-
ence and then pinpoint some of the difficulties encountered
by the debate's participants. It is apropos that Dewey would
devise a "metaphysics" for describing the generic traits or
qualities of experience, rather than (pace McDowell) merely
describing what we mean by the term experience or (pace
Rorty) jettisoning the term metaphysics altogether.
Dewey's metaphysics divulges the generic qualities and
patterns that underlie our experience of the felt and known
world. In the history of philosophy, brilliant figures, from
Plato to Kant to Russell, were mistaken in claiming that cog-
nition, knowing, or reasoning is either the predominant or the
only feature of so-called real or really real human experi-
ence. Rather, it is a small part of our experience of the natural
world and a single mode among many for appreciating what
Dewey terms the "generic traits of existence." "A naturalistic
metaphysics," Dewey notes, "is bound to consider reflection
as itself a natural event occurring within nature because of
the traits of the latter" (LW 1:62). As they are bound up with
these generic traits, our experiences of natural events are
objective and cognitively rich. However, objectivity here
does not mean purely factual, impartial, a God's-eye view or
transcending all perspectives. The tendency to bifurcate our
experience into categories of pure objectivity and plural,
subjective perspectives is one that Dewey eschews in his
naturalistic metaphysics. Instead, the cognitive foreground
of analyzing and resolving problematic situations occurs
against the noncognitive (or precognitive) background of a
situation, initially felt or had and pervaded by a single unify-
ing quality.
The degree of affectivity and qualitative wholeness versus
objectivity and cognitive-richness is reflected in Dewey's
distinction between two phases of experience: (a) primary
and (b) secondary. Only when humans are confronted with
an entirely novel and problematic situation do they shift from
"primary experience," which is habitually "had" and medi-
ated by previously formed habit, to "secondary experience,"
which demands genuine reflection, "knowing" and inquiry.
"The distinction [between primary and secondary experi-
ence]," Dewey (1996) explains, "is one between what is
experienced as a result of a minimum of incidental refection
and what is experienced in consequence of continued and
regulated reflective inquiry" (LW 1:3-4). While the dominant
mode of experience for Dewey is what Lenore Langsdorf
(2002) calls "a complex affair of doing and undergoing . . .
that is `felt'rather than `known'" (p. 151), experience is nev-
ertheless a cyclical, ebb-and-flow movement between pre-
cognitive or felt havings and cognitive knowings (Ralston,
2009, p. 191).
The outcome of each successful inquiry is that experience
grows in ordered richness. Dewey (1996) defines inquiry as
the "controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate
situation into a [determinate and unified] situation" (LW
12:55). "The existence of inquiries," Dewey claims in the
Logic, "is not a matter of doubt. They enter into every area of
life and into every aspect of every area" (LW 12:105). In
"secondary experience," inquirers ideally achieve the objec-
tives of inquiry and, consequently, deliver the objects or out-
comes of inquiry to "primary," practical, or everyday
experience as settled meanings. The net result is that experi-
ence becomes enriched with an ensemble of intelligent habits
(LW 1:379; Fott, 1998; Ryan, 1994). Enriched primary expe-
rience, or what Kenneth Chandler (1977) calls the "alpha and
omega of all theorizing," also renders ideational tools avail-
able for use or "ready-to-hand" (p. 51; Heidegger, 1962;
Ryan, 2004, p. 20). So, once learned through focused inquiry
these experiential lessons are stored or funded as resources in
primary experience for use in future inquiries. Henceforth,
they can be accessed and acted on easily, framing our ongoing
experiences in intelligent and habit-governed ways. In the
Ralston 7
language of cognitive neuroscience, those neural connections
responsible for conceptual meaning at the shell cortical layers
can in turn impact structures at the limbic level responsible
motivation and emotional well-being, thereby producing
what Johnson (2007) calls "a never-ending dance of changing
experience" (p. 101).
What this rendering of Dewey's experiential metaphysics
reveals is that parties on both sides of the experiential given-
ism debate are clearly right on some points, but nearly as
wrong on others. Aikin (2007) is correct that experience is
"at least partially a knowledge affair," though it is predomi-
nantly about having or feeling (primary experience).
However, he is only half-right in claiming that givens for
Dewey are "non-inferential cognitive input . . . necessary for
inquiry" (p. 24). The resources funded in primary experience
(habits, meanings, ideas, and concepts) do provide inputs for
future inquiries. However, primary experience's resources
are inferential, as they are themselves the products of prior
inquiries (secondary experience) made available for subse-
quent inquiries through the funding of experience (secondary
experience again) with habits, values, and concepts. As
Johnson (2007) reminds us, many of our most reliable lin-
guistic operations, metaphors, and habits of inference are
based on image schemas (such as CONTAINMENT and
SOURCE-PATH-GOAL) that are made available to us as
resources in primary experience (p. 139).
To recall Koopman's objection, it is that Dewey's theory
of experience invokes the mythical notion of a Given.
Whether the theory actually does is a point of contention
between him and some classical pragmatists. Hildebrand and
Pappas respond that the Myth of the Given is tied up with
problems of traditional epistemology. As experience for
Dewey bears no relation to knowledge proper, he cannot be
blamed for invoking foundational givens. Thus, Hildebrand
and Pappas deny the charge of experiential givenism because
primary experience, at least for Dewey, is about having or
feeling, not knowing or cognizing. Whose position is stron-
ger? Hildebrand and Pappas are correct in asserting that pri-
mary experience is not about knowledge if they mean that it
is not exclusively about knowledge. However, they are wrong
if they mean that primary experience is wholly noncognitive.
Primary experience funds secondary experience with cogni-
tive resources (perhaps precognitive or transcognitive is a
more apt adjective). When secondary experience generates
tools, habits, concepts, and logical forms as outcomes of
inquiry, these are then funded (or re-funded) back into pri-
mary experience so that they can serve as resources in future
inquiries (marking the return of secondary experience). So,
Koopman is correct if he means that primary experience
loosely resembles an experiential given in the Sellarsian
sense, at least insofar as it "constitutes the ultimate court of
appeals for all factual claims--particular and general--about
the world" (Sellars, 1997, p. 69).4 However, he is incorrect if
he intends to claim that primary experience must, therefore,
be a primordial given. Unlike a given, primary experience is
through-and-through inferential (the resources available in
primary experience are inferred through inquiry or second-
ary experience) and at least partially conceptual (many,
though not all, of the resources in primary experience have
conceptual content).
Finally, Koopman and Aikin's inference from experiential
givenism to empiricist foundationalism is an illicit move of
entailment or equivocation. In contrast, Sellars (1963) makes
the inference from experiential givenism to empiricist foun-
dationalism, but on the sound basis of an elaborate theory
tying verbal and nonverbal events and takings:
The idea of observation . . . constituted by certain self-
authenticating nonverbal episodes, the authority of which is
transmitted to verbal and quasi-verbal performances . . . is, of
course, the heart of the Myth of the Given. For the given, in
epistemological tradition, is what is taken by these self-
authenticating episodes. These "takings" are, so to speak, the
unmoved movers of empirical knowledge, the "knowings in
presence" which are presupposed by all other knowledge, both
the knowledge of general truth and the knowledge "in absence"
of other particular matters of fact. Such is the framework in
which traditional empiricism makes its characteristic claim that
the perceptually given is the foundation of empirical knowledge.
(p. 77)
Notwithstanding a sophisticated Sellarsian account, the
relationship between givenism and foundationalism is more
often one of equivocation, not entailment. For the charges of
givenism and foundationalism to stick (and by implication,
the pragmatist's project of philosophical reconstruction to
fail), the critic must first substantiate the presence of a non-
inferential and nonconceptual content to the given (concern-
ing the origin of the warrant of belief) and, second,
demonstrate that the structure of the warrant is identical to
primary experience (hence foundational). Clearly, the critics
have been unable to accomplish either. Until they do, the
experiential givenism objection remains at best a dubious
charge. Although a fuller case would need to be made, it
appears that the structure of the warrant of belief is found in
inquiry or secondary (not primary) experience. It is only by
experimentally testing beliefs, on Dewey's (1996) account of
inquiry, that they become "warranted" or "warranted asser-
tions" (LW 14: 168-9). As secondary experience is pre-
empted by primary experience, this could lead to the
conclusion that primary experience is the ultimate source of
the warrant of our beliefs, and thus a version of the given.
Once again, though, primary experience provides some of
the conceptual resources for that warrant, and so cannot be
the same nonconceptual given that worried Sellars, Davidson,
and McDowell.
Conclusion
The experiential givenism debate still occupies a marginal
place in mainstream Philosophy and American pragmatism
8 SAGE Open
literature. So, what moves might shift it away from the mar-
gin and toward the center of concern? In the discipline of
Public Administration, a similar debate emerged, but with a
greater emphasis on the implications for the practice of gov-
ernance.5 At the very least, a more practical orientation could
nudge the debate beyond the current state of impasse. Given
John Dewey's concern for "the problems of men" (MW
10:42), it is unsurprising that classic pragmatist would prefer
this route. However, it is also a suggestion that would likely
please neo-pragmatists who, following Richard Rorty's
(1996) similar call, substitute "idealizations of our practices
. . . [for] foundations for those practices" (p. 333). Likewise,
Robert Brandom (2008) believes that a paramount concern
for practice binds classical pragmatists and neo-pragmatists,
Deweyans and Rortyans:
The only question that remains [once we eliminate questions of
truth and objectivity] is one of social engineering: what shape do
our practices need to take in order to institute this kind of
normative status? This is a Deweyian question that Rorty would
have welcomed. (p. 10)
The proposal to engage the practical side of experiential
givenism will strike some as odd, though, as the debate
occurs at such a high level of abstraction, insulated from the
practical concerns of most nonphilosophers (perhaps reflect-
ing its origins in analytic philosophy's obscure epistemology
literature).
Nevertheless, there is some practical value to the proposal--
value that becomes evident once we view it through the prism
of Ludwig Wittgenstein's (1922) aphorism of climbing a lad-
der. We must climb the ladder of a philosophical problem to
eventually kick it away. In doing so, we therapeutically over-
come it (Colapietro, 2011). Therefore, classic pragmatists,
neo-pragmatists, and nonpragmatists alike should take this
heretofore marginal debate seriously for at least two reasons.
First, it highlights critically important issues at the intersection
between two major philosophical traditions (analytic philoso-
phy and American pragmatism) as well as two prominent
branches of the same tradition (classic pragmatism and neo-
pragmatism). Resolving the debate could potentially bridge
gaps and facilitate conversation between these diverse tradi-
tions and branches, thereby making Philosophy as a discipline
more inclusive--or what Koopman (2009) calls a "big-tent"
(p. 48). Second, and perhaps more importantly, working
through or getting over this theoretical debate (following
Wittgenstein's aphorism) could empower contemporary prag-
matists, especially Deweyans, to return to what they arguably
do best: the practical business of pragmatic inquiry or testing
philosophical ideas for the sake of evaluating their concrete
consequences in lived experience.

Notes
1. This is a selective account of the Myth of the Given litera-
ture tailored for the specific purposes of this article. For more
extensive commentaries, see Foss (1968), Brandom (1994),
Chisholm, (1964/1996), Sosa (1997), Bonevac (2002), Alston
(2002), and Hanna (2011).
2. Citations to The Collected Works follow the conventional
method, LW (Later Works) or MW (Middle Works) or EW
(Early Works), volume:page number. For example, MW
10:354 refers to the Middle Works, vol. 10, p. 354.
3. Although Rorty (1979) extensively discussed the Myth of the
Given in his first book, he never used it to criticize Dewey's
theory of experience. He did worry that Dewey's experiential
metaphysics, just by virtue of it being called "metaphysics,"
would reinvigorate the foundationalist metaphysics of the past.
This is likely what Hildebrand and Pappas are referring to when
they claim that Koopman has "repurposed Rorty's charge."
4. This might be a slight overstatement in the case of Dewey's
theory of experience, as inquiry tests beliefs and thus is closer
to what Sellars (1997) calls "the ultimate court of appeals"
(p. 69).
5. A parallel debate about experiential givenism, antifounda-
tionalism, and pragmatism was waged by pragmatists--most
notably, Patricia Shields (2003)--and neo-pragmatists--espe-
cially Hugh Miller (2005)--concerned about the relationship
between public administration theory and practice. For a sum-
mary of the debate, see Ralston (2010).
