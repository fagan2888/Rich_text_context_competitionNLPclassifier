Abstract
Objectives: To examine the role of numeracy, or comfort with numbers, as a potential risk factor for financial elder exploi-
tation in a community sample.
Method: Individually administered surveys were given to 201 independent, community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older. Risk
for financial elder exploitation was assessed using the Older Adult Financial Exploitation Measure (OAFEM). Other variables
of interest included numeracy, executive functioning, and other risk factors identified from the literature. Assessments were
completed individually at the Wood Lab at Scripps College in Claremont, CA and neighboring community centers.
Results: After controlling for other variables, including education, lower numeracy was related to higher scores on the
OAFEM consistent with higher risk for financial exploitation. Self-reported physical and mental health, male gender, and
younger age were also related to increased risk.
Conclusions: Results indicated that numeracy is a significant risk factor for elder financial exploitation after controlling for
other commonly reported variables. These findings are consistent with the broader literature relating numeracy to wealth
and debt levels and extend them to the area of elder financial exploitation.
Keywords: Elder mistreatment--Numeracy--Risk factors
At 7:00 a.m. Betty Bell, aged 88 years, received a call tell-
ing her that she had failed to attend jury duty and that
the police were on their way to arrest her. To avoid being
arrested she needed to pay a fine. Fortunately, Betty's nurse
aid got on the phone and the caller hung up (Olson, 2014).
Millions of older adults, however, are not as lucky as Betty
is. Indeed, governments, law enforcement agencies, and
third-sector organizations have long been interested in
reducing the rate of financial victimization, but with little
hard data to support any specific programs (Scheibe et al.,
2014).
Financial elder abuse is increasingly common (Dong,
2014), and researchers have long been interested in what fac-
tors help protect older adults against financial exploitation.
We define financial elder exploitation (FE) broadly in this
paper as the illegal or improper use of older adults' finan-
cial resources. Large population-based studies have, thus,
examined common correlates of financial elder abuse (U.S.
Government Accountability Office, 2011), emphasizing
demographic variables such as age, race, and income (Beach,
Schulz, Castle, & Rosen, 2010; Garre-Olmo et al., 2009;
Laumann, Leitsch, & Waite, 2008). Functional depend-
ence--activities of daily living (ADLS) and instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLS), and some mental and
physical health diagnostic information (depression, current
diagnoses)--were also found to be related to elder financial
exploitation (Acierno, Hernandez-Tejada, Muzzy, & Steve,
2009; Beach et al., 2010; Lichtenberg, Stickney, & Paulson,
2013). There has also been a growing interests in the link
between cognitive variables such as memory and executive
functioning, and financial elder abuse (Dong, 2014).
Although the research on financial exploitation of
older adults has gained some attention, a parallel line of
research has focused the relationship between cognitive
ability and financial behavior, such as investing. Based on a
series of studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment
and moderate dementia, neuropsychological measures
have been linked to financial incapacity including arith-
metic abilities, executive functioning, and verbal memory
(Griffith et al., 2003; Marson, Earnst, Jamil, Bartolucci, &
Harrell, 2000; Martin et al., 2008). Decline in arithmetic
skills as assessed by the WRAT-R calculation subtest was
associated with impairment in financial capacity in the very
earliest stages of mild cognitive impairment (Griffith et al.).
Even among healthy adults, researchers have shown that
higher cognitive abilities are associated with increased like-
lihood to plan for the future and participate as investors in
financial market (Cole & Shastry, 2009).
Numeracy--usually conceptualized as the capacity to
understand and manipulate basic mathematical concepts--is
a variable that has been reported to be important in a broad
range of decision-making contexts (Schwartz, Woloshin,
Black, & Welch, 1997). However, numeracy is a distinct con-
struct from basic calculation abilities and influences not only
an individual's ability to "do the math" but also their engage-
ment, comprehension, and use of numeric information in
decision making (Reyna, Nelson, Han, & Dieckmann, 2009).
A paper by Hung, Parker, and Yoong (2009) maintains that
while numeracy and financial literacy have certain features in
common, they capture different abilities, skills, and knowl-
edge. The authors argue, therefore that, "it is more produc-
tive to keep general numeracy distinct from financial literacy"
(2009, p. 7). Numeracy, however, is not only a separate
capacity than financial literacy. After reviewing the literature,
Reyna and colleagues (2009) state that on "the basis of stud-
ies that have controlled for education, intelligence, literacy,
and other factors, we can be reasonably sure that numeracy
is a separate faculty" (p. 967).
Typically, assessments of numeracy include an indi-
vidual's ability to understand probabilities. For example,
Peters and colleagues (2006) have reported that indi-
viduals lower in numeracy are more susceptible to cer-
tain biases in the decision making, such as being more
susceptible to framing effects in their medical decision
making. These individuals are more likely to demonstrate
the "denominator" effect, that is, focusing on a numera-
tor, but ignoring the denominator when estimating prob-
abilities. Individuals lower in numeracy have also been
reported to be more susceptible to mood effects, that is,
demonstrating overconfidence when in a positive mood
(Reyna & Brust-Renck, 2014). Numeracy appears to be
related to deliberative reasoning in the sense that infor-
mation derived from numbers is more easily extracted
and comprehended in high numerate individuals.
Individuals lower in numeracy have been reported to be
left with information that is less complete and less under-
stood than in high numerate individuals. As a result, the
low numerate appears to be influenced by competing
irrelevant affective factors (Peters et al., 2006). Ample
research has demonstrated the importance of numer-
acy as a protective factor in both the health and finan-
cial domains. Individuals high in numeracy make better
health insurance decisions (Hibbard, Mahoney, Stock, &
Tusler, 2007), and numeracy is an independent predictor
of people's ability to choose a health plan (Hibbard et al.,
2007; Wood et al., 2011). Interestingly, older adults tend
to be less numerate than younger adults and therefore
may be at higher risk for poor decision making (Jenkins,
Ackerman, Frumkin, Salter, & Vorhaus, 2011).
Works by Lusardi and Mitchell (2007, 2011) have
highlighted the important link between numeracy and the
ability to understand, grapple, and utilize financial infor-
mation. Their studies show that numeracy is related to the
ability to correctly answer financial questions, make bet-
ter financial decisions about their retirement saving, and
more likely to pay off loans and credit cards (Lusardi &
Mitchell, 2011; Lusardi & Tufano, 2009). Also, it has been
argued that one way of protecting older adults from FE is
to increase their financial knowledge (Gamble, Boyle, Yu,
& Bennett, 2014). Despite this corpus of data, we know of
few empirical studies that have examined the link between
numeracy and financial exploitation among older adults.
Given earlier work linking financial capacity to mild cogni-
tive impairment, it is, therefore, reasonable to predict that
numeracy may also be an indicator of risk in a nonclinical
group (Griffith et al., 2003).
Assessment of financial exploitation has been done tra-
ditionally by a single-item measure. Realizing its limita-
tion, researchers have developed a multiple-item interview
questions to better capture the complexity and diversity of
financial exploitation (Acierno et al., 2009, 2010; Beach
et al., 2010). Probably the most in-depth and comprehen-
sive measure currently available, the Self-Report Measure
of Financial Exploitation of Older Adults (the Older Adult
Financial Exploitation Measure [OAFEM]) is a 79-item,
client self-report measure that has been psychometrically
validated in a sample of abused older adults (Conrad, Iris,
Ridings, Langley, & Wilber, 2010). The OAFEM covers six
domains of financial exploitation: theft and scams, abuse
of trust, financial entitlements, coercion, signs of possible
abuse, and risk factors. The wide variety of domains cov-
ered in the OAFEM makes the measure more likely than
others to detect potential financial exploitation that has
taken place within the past 12 months. These character-
istics render the OAFEM as the best instrument for our
purposes, which is the study of elder financial exploitation
broadly defined in a community sample.
In the current study, we interviewed a sample of commu-
nity-dwelling older adults to identify risk factors for finan-
cial exploitation. Previous work in elder mistreatment has
Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 6 979
found that dependency, physical health, and mental health
are important risk factors in elder mistreatment (see Wilber
& Reynold, 1997, for a theoretical overview). We included
these variables and added executive functioning, general
cognitive functioning, and numeracy. It was hypothesized
that lower scores on all of the cognitive measures will
be a critical risk factor for higher scores on the OAFEM.
However, we were especially interested in the role that
numeracy may play in vulnerability to financial exploita-
tion in this project.
Method
Participants
A total of 201 community-dwelling adults aged 60 and
older were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Area.
Participants were residents in Claremont and nearby cities
recruited from an existing participant pool, or with flyers
distributed to senior centers and retirement communities.
Participants' average age was 74.84 years (SD = 8.17;
range 60­95 years) and were highly educated (16.05 years
of education; SD = 3.09). Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) average score was 28.25 (SD = 2.03), ranging
from 20 to 30.
Measures
OAFEM ( = 0.83)
The OAFEM contains 79 items of exploitation statements
(Conrad et al., 2010). Participants self-reported whether
each statement had occurred to them within the past
12 months. Positive endorsement received a score of 2, sus-
picion of exploitation received a score of 1, and negative
endorsement received a score of 0. Responses could range
from 0, indicating no exploitation, to 158. As indicated by
Conrad and colleagues, the OAFEM is unidimensional,
Rasch person and item reliability were high, and fit of the
79 items were fine.
Numeracy
An 11-item numeracy scale was included to assess numeri-
cal literacy (Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2001). Most of the
questions assess basic calculation or probability. One point
was given for each correctly answered question, with the
highest possible score of 11.
Dependency
The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADLS)
was used to measure dependency (Lawton & Brody,
1969). Research assistants were trained to interview par-
ticipants about their ability to perform daily activities
independently. IADLS score was based on abilities in eight
domains of daily living, including ability to use a tele-
phone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry,
transportation, medication adherence, and financial man-
agement. Participants received 1 point for each domain in
which they can handle the domain tasks; thus, the possible
score ranges from 0 to 8.
Physical health and mental health
The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) includes
subjective physical and mental health questions rated by
participants themselves (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996).
Score range for the SF-12 is 0­100, with a lower score indi-
cating poorer health.
General cognition: MMSE
The Folstein MMSE is a 30-item scale that will be used to
screen participants for cognitive impairment and to help
stage level of impairment (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,
1975). Each item answered correctly received 1 point.
Executive functioning: Trail Making Tests A and B
The Trail Making Test A requires participants to trace a
sequence of numbers while timed and can be used as a
simple measure of processing speed (Reitan, 1958). Trail
Making Test B requires participants to shift between two
streams of information and was found frequently to be
impaired in the LACEAFC data on victims of financial
exploitation (Wood et al., 2014). Executive performance
was calculated as the difference of task completion time
between part A and B (B - A difference), which adjusted for
general slowing with age (Bowie & Harvey, 2006).
Executive functioning: Stroop task
The color-word-interference task takes advantage of partic-
ipants' ability to read words faster than respond to colors.
Participants were asked to name the ink color of a list of
words; for example, the word green was written in blue
ink. The task measures executive functioning on inhibition.
The Delis­Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D­KEFS)
version of the color-word-interference task was used (Delis,
Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001). This measure included the tra-
ditional color-word version and a more challenging color-
word-condition version for four color-word-interference
conditions in total.
Demographics
The demographic questionnaire included age, gender, ethnic-
ity, education, marital status, and living situation. No identi-
fying information such as name or social security was asked.
Procedure
The study materials were part of a larger, ongoing NIJ
funded study on elder financial exploitation. The study pro-
tocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review
boards, and all participants provided informed consent.
A 2-hr meeting session was scheduled for participants to
980 Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 6
complete the study individually at Scripps College or local
senior centers. Research assistants conducted interviews
and assisted participants to complete a survey/interview
battery including the above measures. Time to complete the
study varied from 50 to 120min, depending on the number
of breaks taken and the relative speed of participants.When
participants completed the battery, they were thanked and
given $25 for their participation.
Results
On average,participants' OAFEM score was 7.26,whereas
the median was 4.00. Our sample contained more women
(70.1%) and Caucasians (83.6%) and 60.2% of partici-
pants were married or lived with a partner (see Table 1).
Empirically, no score has been identified as a cutoff point
for elder financial exploitation substantiation on the
OAFEM. With the possible range of 0­158, a mean of
7.26 indicated that few elder financial exploitation cases
were at severe levels. One can conceptualize the OAFEM
on a continuum with risk for FE and mild symptoms at
the low end and substantiated severe cases at the high
end. Our sample of community-dwelling individuals
with a mean score of 7.26 clearly represents the mild end
with many individuals (64/201) endorsing no for all the
79 items.
Although the OAFEM distribution might reflect the
national incidence of 5% elder financial exploitation
(Acierno et al., 2009), adjustments are required for statisti-
cal analysis after examining the data distribution. Because
the distribution of OAFEM scores was strongly positively
skewed (skewness = 4.03, kurtosis = 23.18), the assump-
tions of linear regression analysis with the OAFEM as a
dependent variable were not satisfied. When data are sub-
stantially positively skewed, it is suggested to perform a
logarithmic transformation (Howell, 2009; Tabachnick &
Fidell, 2012). A small constant (one) was added to all par-
ticipants' OAFEM score because some participants, who
did not experience any of the 79 events, reported zero val-
ues of the OAFEM.The transformed log OAFEM produced
improved skewness and kurtosis values (skewness = 0.23,
kurtosis = -0.98). Subsequent analysis, therefore, adopted
the log-transformation OAFEM as the dependent variable.
Trail making tests and Stroop tasks also went through the
same logarithmic transformation due to the skewed data
distribution. The case number, mean, and standard devia-
tion of each potential predictor, as well as correlations
between predictors are listed in Table 2.
The first model included only demographic variables.
Male participants scored higher on the OAFEM. A below-
average standard of living was related to higher OAFEM
score (Table 3). Numeracy was added to the second model.
Unlike with the first model, more years of education was
related to higher OAFEM score. Lower numeracy was
associated with higher OAFEM score above and beyond
demographic controls (R2 = 0.04, F(1, 184) = 7.52,
p = .007).
Numeracy remained a significant predictor even after
other risk factors were entered into subsequent models. In
Models 3 and 4, worse physical and mental health were
associated with higher OAFEM score, whereas younger,
male, and more educated participants also reported
higher OAFEM scores. In Model 3, controlling for other
risk factors, lower numeracy was still related to higher
OAFEM score (R2 = 0.02, F(1, 168) = 4.52, p = .035).
Similar to the results from Model 3, lower numeracy con-
tinued to be related to higher OAFEM score (R2 = 0.02,
F(1, 154) = 4.80, p = .030) after risk factors and exec-
utive functioning were taken into account in Model
4. Executive functioning, however, was not related to the
OAFEM.

Discussion
With millions of older adults experiencing financial exploi-
tation (Acierno et al., 2010), it is vital to gain a better under-
standing of what protects them from FE. As expected, our
data reveal that numeracy plays a key role. High numeracy
was found to be a significant predictor of decreased risk
after controlling for other demographic variables. Less
numerate participants reported risk of experiencing finan-
cial exploitation significantly more frequently. Importantly,
numeracy remained a significant predictor in the presence
of other risk factors, including dependency, physical and
mental health, as well as overall cognition. Our findings,
thus, are aligned with those of Hung and colleagues (2009)
and Reyna and colleagues (2009) that numeracy acts as an
independent factor in the medical and financial domain.
Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper
to illustrate the protective role numeracy plays in tackling
financial exploitation.
Recent research in numeracy has documented its
importance for decision making in a spectrum of contexts.
Individuals lower in numeracy, in general, are less likely
to engage with numeric information and are less able to
extract meaningful and precise information resulting in
errors (Peters et al., 2006; Wood et al., 2011). Further, low
numerate individuals have been reported to be more sus-
ceptible to certain biases in their decision making including
increased susceptibility to verbal versus numeric risk infor-
mation, framing, and mood effects (Gurmankin, Baron,
& Armstrong, 2004; Peters et al., 2006; Reyna & Brust-
Renck, 2014). We propose that low numeracy presents as
a risk factor for financial exploitation because it may limit
individuals from understanding and engaging in delibera-
tive reasoning. As such, individuals with lower numeracy
may be at greater risk for financial exploitation. Although
our study provides preliminary support for this hypoth-
esis, indirect evidence supporting our suggestion comes
from a study by Fischer, Lea, and Evans (2013). Although
the authors did not investigate the role of numeracy, they
argue that what distinguishes those who fall victim to scams
from those who don't is the reliance on ineffective decision
techniques. In a similar vein, DeLiema, Yon, and Wilber
(2014) reported that diminished cognitive resources can
increase the success of persuasion tactics used by fraudu-
lent sales agents. As argued earlier, low-numeracy individ-
uals are more likely to be the ones to engage in ineffective
decision techniques in the medical and financial domains.
It seems reasonable, thus, to argue that they also fail to use
adequate decision techniques when dealing with possible
financial exploitation threats. In an older adult sample, it is
likely that some individuals due to lack of education may
have never obtained a high degree of numeracy, whereas
others may have demonstrated capacity at 1 point, but
have declined. These subgroups may present with differ-
ent types of risk and may benefit from different types of
interventions.
Interestingly, executive functioning was not related
to financial exploitation in this sample. Executive func-
tioning has been reported as a critical domain in other
studies of financial exploitation and we expected that to
be the case here as well (Wood et al., 2014). Executive

functioning can be measured by a wide range of assess-
ment tools that may tap reasoning, impulse control, flex-
ibility, and planning. In this relatively high-functioning
sample, it may be that the tasks we chose were not sen-
sitive enough to provide discrimination. It is also pos-
sible that executive functioning emerges as a risk factor
only in more impaired populations. Indeed, in a previous
paper, it was found that the Trail Making B measure was
significantly lower among victim sample compared with
a control group; however, in that study, the substanti-
ated victims were lower functioning (mean MMSE = 23)
(Wood et al., 2014).
This study was designed to focus on community-dwell-
ing individuals who may or may not be at risk for current
and future financial exploitation. We predicted that many
of the individuals would show no risk and hoped that we
could find measures that discriminated a "pro-dromal"
group similar to work relating financial capacity to mild
cognitive impairment (Griffith et al., 2003). In our work
with substantiated FE victims, we have observed that by
the time an intervention has occurred by social services,
many had already suffered exploitation for years and been
serial victims of FE. At that point, because of significant
impairment, only formal protections (conservatorship,
fiduciary assistance, and power of attorney) could be
used to minimize risk. In the current study, our focus has
shifted to individuals who had a variety of levels of risk but
were generally lower than substantiated elder abuse sam-
ples because we believed that these individuals will most
likely benefit from intervention and be most amenable to
interventions.
As a result of this sampling decision, our current sam-
ple had low scores on the OAFEM. Conrad et al. (2010)
provide some guidance for characterizing severity. For
example, a difference between two scores can be safely
assumed to be at different severity levels when it is two
times greater than standard deviation, although most of
our sample lacked variability. Additionally, it is difficult
to pinpoint an exact cutoff for financial exploitation
occurrence, as the instrument includes items that might be
better categorized as risk than occurrence. The restricted
range of scores may have limited the ability for some rela-
tionships to emerge, for instance, dependency and overall
cognition were not significant predictors to elder finan-
cial exploitation. However, we did replicate some previ-
ous findings including seeing a link between physical
and mental health and experiencing mistreatment (e.g.,
Acierno et al., 2009). It is also likely that different models
of risk will emerge in different subgroups of older adults
(cognitively intact, mild cognitive impairment, and clearly
impaired). For example, numeracy may well be a critical
factor in high-functioning seniors, but may play a minor
role among older adults with lower ranges of cognitive
ability.
Other limitations of this study included sample com-
position, as our relatively highly educated, active sample
of older adults is not representative of the general popula-
tion of older adults. It is important to note that even in
this sample, risk for financial exploitation emerged. Future
studies should target more representative population. We
did not deliberately exclude cognitively impaired older
adults, thus ended up with a small subset of our sample
scoring lower on the MMSE (six older adults scored lower
than 23). Nonetheless, all participants were living indepen-
dently in the community and arranged their own trans-
portation to participate in the study. Moreover, although
our data indicated numeracy to be a risk factor, we cannot
infer a causal relationship between numeracy and financial
exploitation.
In summary, we provide evidence that it is feasible to
evaluate risk in community samples using the OAFEM.
Although overall scores were low, the majority of our sam-
ple (137/201) endorsed at least one item on the OAFEM.We
find that variables associated with elder mistreatment con-
tinue to demonstrate a significant relationship in our sample
(physical health and mental health). Above and beyond our
basic model, numeracy demonstrated a significant relation-
ship to risk of financial exploitation, with lower numerate
participants reporting higher levels of financial exploitation.
These findings are in line with other work indicating the
importance of numeracy in financial decision making.
