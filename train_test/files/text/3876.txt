Introduction
It is well known that individuals living with chronic illness
are at increased risk for psychological distress and mental
health problems, which negatively affect the overall health
of these individuals, as well as their capacity to function in
everyday life (Kessler, Ormel, Demler, & Stang, 2003;
Naylor et al., 2012; Vogeli et al., 2007). Specifically, chronic
illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes constitute signifi-
cant risk predisposing individuals to mental health problems
that can negatively affect their work, socioeconomic status,
social support, capacity for self-management, and adaptation
to other illnesses (Brands et al., 2007; Dewa, Lin, Kooehoorn,
& Goldner, 2007; Egede & Ellis, 2010; Livneh, Lott, &
Antonak, 2004; Munir et al., 2007). It has also been docu-
mented that as the severity of physical illness increases, so
will concurrent mental illness (Sederer, Silver, McVeigh, &
Levy, 2006). Furthermore, untreated psychological distress
and mental health problems frequently follow a chronic
course (Chapman, Perry, & Strine, 2005; Monroe, Slavich,
Torres, & Gotlib, 2007), resulting in a tremendous level of
burden for the individual, family, community, and health
care system (Drake, Bond, Thornicroft, Knapp, & Goldman,
2012). Despite this high degree of need, there is evidence to

Abstract
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group
intervention to reduce psychological distress as well as to strengthen self-esteem, resilience, and general well-being for
individuals living with a chronic illness and/or other health challenges. This pilot study employed a pre­posttest design to
evaluate the outcome of the intervention for individuals receiving care in a Community and Family Medicine department and
a Women's Health Centre located in an urban downtown hospital. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in the study and 35
participants completed the intervention. Thirty-five of 42 enrolled participants completed the intervention. Twenty-eight
participants completed the pretest and posttest assessments, which demonstrated statistically significant improvement on
most outcome measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies­Depression Rating Scale (CES-D), Depression
Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Affect Balance Scale (ABS), the Resilience Scale (RS), and the Five-Item World Health
Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Large effect sizes were observed for the CES-D, the ABS, and the DASS Stress
subscale. Observed improvements were sustained at 4 weeks posttreatment. Results are consistent with studies indicating
that MBCT offers promise in alleviating psychological distress for those who are seeking care in primary health care settings.
Continued focus on how to best implement MBCT in primary health care, particularly for those with comorbid physical and
mental health conditions, supports the World Health Organization's recommendation to integrate evidence-based mental
health care within primary health care to promote equitable access to care for those most in need.

suggest that access to quality care is limited; with the institu-
tional and professional separation of mental and physical
health care resulting in fragmented approaches to care
(Naylor et al., 2012; Vasiliadis, Tempier, Lesage, & Kates,
2009; Vogeli et al., 2007).
Overall, there is an aversion to seeking mental health care
(Gaynor & Brown, 2013), regardless of whether these mental
health concerns are in the context of chronic physical illness
(Roberge, Fournier, Duhoux, Nguyen, & Smolders, 2011).
Moreover, globally, two thirds of adults are not receiving
effective mental health care services (Chisholm et al., 2007;
Ngui, Khasakhala, Ndetei, & Roberts, 2010). To increase
access to quality mental health care for vulnerable groups,
the World Health Organization (WHO, World Organization
of National Colleges, Academies, & Academic Associations
of General Practitioners/Family Physicians, 2008) identified
the integration of evidence-based mental health care into pri-
mary health care as one of the most effective approaches.
Primary care settings provide care where people live and
work, and thus support a population-based approach to care
that is accessible (Naylor et al., 2012) and less stigmatizing
(Zeiss & Karlin, 2008). Evidence-based mental health inter-
ventions are ideally suited to primary care environments as
they are less intensive and can address the health concerns of
individuals with physical and/or chronic illness, as well as
mental health challenges (Cape, Whittington, Buszewicz,
Wallace, & Underwood, 2010; Cully et al., 2010; Jané-
Llopis, Barry, Hosman, & Patel, 2005; Zaretsky, Segal, &
Fefergrad, 2007).
One major barrier to the effective integration of evi-
dence-based strategies in primary care is the lack of evi-
dence regarding effective interventions to prevent and
reduce psychological distress in the context of chronic ill-
ness (de Lusignan, Chan, Parry, Dent-Brown, & Kendrick,
2011; Spurgeon, Hicks, Barwell, Walton, & Spurgeon, 2005;
Taylor et al., 2007). To date, public health strategies to
address mental health problems are directed primarily
toward the detection, diagnosis, and medical treatment of
depression (Gilbody, Whitty, Grimshaw, & Thomas, 2003;
Stewart, 2008; van Weel, van Weel-Baumgarten, & van
Rijswijk, 2009). Evidence indicates that best practice for
depression is the combination of medication and psycho-
logical interventions (Parikh et al., 2009); however, evi-
dence-based psychological treatments, such as cognitive
therapy or mindfulness-based approaches, are not readily
available in primary care (Naylor et al., 2012; Patten &
Juby, 2008; Shafran et al., 2009). As such, current policy is
focused on how best to support the integration of evidence-
based approaches within primary care settings, as exempli-
fied by the United Kingdom's commitment to expand access
to psychological therapies, known as "talking therapies"
(Department of Health, 2011) among the general popula-
tion. Furthermore, Canada's Mental Health Strategy advo-
cates for increased access to psychological therapies, as well
as increased integration of mental health services within
primary care (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2012).
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal,
Williams, & Teasdale, 2012) is an empirically supported
mental health intervention that is administered in a group
format and teaches individuals to disengage from repetitive
patterns of negative thinking by shifting perspective from
mindless cognitive processing to a more engaged mindful
processing of experience (Segal et al., 2012). MBCT extends
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn,
1991) by combining mindfulness-based strategies with ele-
ments of cognitive therapy. A review of research findings
demonstrates that MBCT is highly effective in preventing
relapse for individuals who have experienced three or more
episodes of depression (Ma & Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale
et al., 2000). A recent meta-analysis of randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) concerning the effectiveness of mindful-
ness-based interventions, namely, MBCT and MBSR,
extended these findings and found that MBCT is particularly
beneficial for people with a depressive disorder who are cur-
rently experiencing symptoms (Strauss, Cavanagh, Oliver, &
Pettman, 2014).
While originally developed to prevent recurrent depres-
sion, MBCT shows promise in alleviating psychological dis-
tress associated with chronic depression as well as a wide
range of illnesses (Eisendrath, Chartier, & McLane, 2008;
Finucane & Mercer, 2006; Radford, Crane, Eames, Gold, &
Owens, 2012; Ree & Craigie, 2007). For example, MBCT
has significantly improved psychological distress in individ-
uals with cancer (Foley, Baillie, Huxter, Price, & Sinclaire,
2010; Sharplin et al., 2010), bipolar disorder (Stange et al.,
2011), Parkinson's disease (Fitzpatrick, Simpson, & Smith,
2010), generalized anxiety disorder (Evans et al., 2008;
Wong et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2016), fibromyalgia (Parra-
Delgado & Latorre-Postigo, 2013), tinnitus (Philippot, Nef,
Clauw, de Romrée, & Segal, 2011), and medically unex-
plained symptoms (van Ravesteijn et al., 2013). An overview
of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs conducted
by Gotlink et al. (2015) concerning the effectiveness of
MBCT and MBSR for a wide range of common chronic con-
ditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain,
depression, and anxiety disorders supports the use of these
mindfulness-based interventions to alleviate both mental and
physical health symptoms. Similarly, the results of a meta-
analytic review by Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, and Oh (2010)
suggest that mindfulness-based therapy is an effective inter-
vention for treating anxiety and mood problems in clinical
populations, specifically for those who had a psychological
or physical/medical disorder. Another systematic review of
the literature by Crowe et al. (2016) evaluating the effective-
ness of only MBSR, and not MBCT, in improving physical
health outcomes for long-term physical conditions reported
that most of the studies reviewed demonstrated improve-
ments in psychological symptoms.
McCay et al. 3
Indeed, studies employing mindfulness-based interven-
tions, specifically MBCT and MBSR, for patient adjustment
to chronic illness have shown promising results. However,
given the emphasis in MBCT on developing skills to cope
with the negative thinking patterns frequently associated
with a wide range of long-term health challenges and con-
cerns, it may be that MBCT has a particular advantage in
alleviating psychological distress experienced by individuals
seeking care in primary care settings. To the best of our
knowledge, few studies have been undertaken that evaluate
the effectiveness of MBCT for individuals with long-term
illness and health concerns, implemented by frontline clini-
cians in primary care settings. In two exploratory studies
where MBCT was evaluated in primary care settings
(Finucane & Mercer, 2006; Radford et al., 2012), MBCT was
offered to participants who were either experiencing elevated
depression and/or anxiety, or were vulnerable to increased
depression and/or anxiety. Results of these preliminary stud-
ies suggest that MBCT may be effective in addressing
depression and anxiety in primary care settings; however,
these studies do not indicate whether participants were also
experiencing additional health challenges, such as chronic
illness and/or other stressful life events. A randomized con-
trolled clinical trial by Wong et al. (2011; Wong et al., 2016)
supported the effect of MBCT on generalized anxiety disor-
der among Chinese community patients in Hong Kong.
While the participants were recruited by referral from doc-
tors who worked in an Outpatient Clinic and a website avail-
able to the general public, it is unclear where the intervention
took place and whether MBCT was in fact implemented
within a primary care setting. Furthermore, three instructors
with experience in either MBSR or MBCT led the MBCT
groups; however, it is uncertain whether these instructors
were connected to existing primary care teams. The same
limitation is true for the study by van Ravesteijn et al. (2013),
which reported on findings of an RCT to assess the cost-
effectiveness of MBCT for a heterogeneous group of patients
with medically unexplained symptoms. These patients
belonged to the 10% most frequently attending patients of
the participating general practitioners. While MBCT was on
average shown to be more effective than enhanced usual
care, the MBCT trainers were not integrated into the existing
care team. As is evident from this review of the literature, the
majority of MBCT studies do not address the generalizability
of MBCT to real world primary care settings (Kuyken et al.,
2010; Lilja, Broberg, Norlander, & Broberg, 2015).
As such, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of MBCT, implemented by frontline clinicians
within primary care, to improve psychological well-being for
individuals living with persistent illness and/or other health
challenges (e.g., life stressors). It was hypothesized that par-
ticipation in the MBCT intervention would reduce psycho-
logical distress, specifically depression and anxiety, as well
as strengthen self-esteem, resilience, and general well-being
for individuals living with a chronic illness and/or other
health challenges. The ultimate purpose was to provide pilot
data to support larger well controlled studies to increase
access to effective primary mental health care services.
Method
This study employed a pre­posttest design. The study mea-
sures were administered to all participants at baseline, imme-
diately after the completion of the intervention, and at a
4-week follow-up.
Participants
A total of 42 patients were recruited from the Department of
Community and Family Medicine and from the Women's
Health Care Centre at an urban downtown hospital. To be
eligible, participants identified that they were experiencing
elevated levels of psychological distress related to a chronic
illness and/or other health challenges for 2 years or less. In
addition, participants were older than 18 years of age, under
the care of a physician, as well as able to speak and under-
stand English and provide informed consent. Eligible partici-
pants were invited to participate in the study by their primary
care physician at each clinic. Forty-two participants agreed
to participate in the study. Thirty-five of the 42 participants
completed the intervention with seven participants dropping
out. Individuals reported a number of reasons for dropping
out including scheduling conflicts and challenges engaging
in MBCT. Of the 35 participants who completed the inter-
vention, 28 completed both the pretest and posttest question-
naires.Atotal of 20 participants completed the questionnaires
at all three time points: pretest, posttest, and at a 4-week
follow-up. Although 35 out of 42 participants completed the
MBCT intervention, a number of participants were unable to
complete the follow-up questionnaires at posttest (7) and at
the 4-week follow-up (8), due to time demands.
Table 1 provides the demographic characteristics for
those participants who completed the intervention (N = 35).
Participants ranged in age between 23 and 71 years with a
mean age of 43.74. The majority of participants (68.6%)
were female. Most participants reported being single (40%)
or married (31.4%). At the start of the intervention, five of
the 35 participants were attending school (14.3%), and
approximately half of the sample was employed (48.6%).
The majority of participants did not have any children
(74.3%), and 35% of the sample were born outside of Canada
(e.g., Africa, China, India, Europe). Most of the participants
spoke English at home (77.1%).
The majority of participants who completed the interven-
tion identified that they were living with a chronic illness,
such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, arthritis, HIV/
AIDS, and/or physical symptoms such as chronic pain or
hypertension (see Table 2). Virtually all participants identi-
fied multiple health challenges including mental health chal-
lenges, however, only primary health challenges are identified

in Table 2. A number of participants (n = 9) experienced men-
tal health challenges such as anxiety and depression in con-
junction with chronic illness or symptoms although all
participants identified elevated psychological distress, which
was an inclusion criteria for the study. Furthermore, a small
number of participants (n = 4) identified a mental health chal-
lenge such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit disorder
as their primary symptom. As well, some participants (n = 6)
identified coping with stressors, such as being laid off work,
retirement, and coping with pregnancy under trying circum-
stances as their primary health challenge. In addition, all par-
ticipants, with the exception of one, identified a range of life
stressors such as unemployment, retirement, financial issues,
or family challenges such as divorce, or stress pertaining to
children, in conjunction with the primary health challenges
identified.
Procedure
As identified above, participants were recruited from the
Department of Community and Family Medicine Program
and from the Women's Health Care Centre at a downtown
urban hospital in Toronto. Prior to conducting the study, eth-
ics approval was obtained from the appropriate research eth-
ics boards. Two social workers met with each participant to
explain MBCT and the expectations of involvement in the

intervention. Prior to the start of the study, informed consent
was obtained from the study participants. The intervention
was conducted by two social workers employed within the
Department of Family and Community Medicine and at the
Woman's Health Care Centre who possess a depth of knowl-
edge and clinical experience in mindfulness and cognitive-
behavioral strategies, including personal experience with
meditation. The intervention was conducted in a local com-
munity setting affiliated with a downtown Toronto hospital.
Measures
The study questionnaires were selected in accordance with
the study purpose and hypothesis to assess mental health
challenges and strengths for the participants, and have sound
psychometric properties. Relevant sociodemographic char-
acteristics were included to provide a comprehensive
description of the sample.
Affect Balance Scale (ABS).The ABS is a 10-item scale that
contains five statements reflecting positive feelings and five
statements reflecting negative feelings (Bradburn, 1969).
The focus of the scale is on overall psychological well-being
with responses of "yes" or "no" to each question. The indi-
vidual is asked to focus on his or her feelings during the past
week. This scale has strong test­retest reliability and high
levels of internal consistency (Schiaffino, 2003). A higher
score on this scale represents an overall positive mood state.
A constant of 15 was added to the ABS scores to yield a dis-
tribution of positive numbers.
Center for Epidemiological Studies­Depression Scale (CES-
D).The CES-D scale is 20-item measure of psychological
distress and depression that has been used in studies with
young people and adults. Excellent levels of internal consis-
tency have been reported, as well as concurrent and construct
validity (Radloff, 1977). A higher score on the CES-D scale
indicates a greater degree of depression.
DepressionAnxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The DASS is a 42-item
self-report instrument that is used to measure an individual's
depression, anxiety, and stress within the past week (Antony,
Bieling, Cox, Enns, & Swinson, 1998). The DASS has dem-
onstrated strong internal consistency, as well as robust con-
vergent and discriminant validity in large clinical samples
(Brown, Chorpita, Korotitsch, & Barlow, 1997). Higher
scores on each subscale indicate greater distress.
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The RSES (Rosenberg,
1979) is a well-validated 10-item self-report inventory
developed to measure global self-worth. The RSES has
been shown to have high levels of internal consistency as
well as convergent and discriminant validity (Sinclair et al.,
2010). A higher score on the RSES signals a higher level of
self-esteem.
The Resilience Scale (RS). The RS (Wagnild & Young, 1993)
is a 25-item self-report scale with a 7-point Likert-type
response format. Resilience is a positive characteristic that
enhances individual adaptation and is conceptualized as
comprising personal competence and acceptance of self and
life. Reliability and concurrent validity have been demon-
strated with adults (Wagnild & Young, 1993), as well as for
homeless adolescents (Rew, Taylor-Seehafer, Thomas, &
Yockey, 2001).
Five-Item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5;
1998 version).The WHO-5, 1998 version, is a five-item
questionnaire using a 6-point rating scale from 0 to 5, where
individuals are asked to select a response based on how they
have been feeling in the past 2 weeks. Five indicates the
highest level of well-being and 0 indicates the lowest level of
well-being. The five items are based on how the individual
feels, specifically; relaxed, cheerful, fresh, rested, and spend-
ing time doing things that interest him or her (WHO, 1998).
This measure of well-being has been shown to have high lev-
els of internal and external validity, and concurrent validity
in a range of populations, including the older adult popula-
tion with depression (Heun, Bonsignore, Barkow, & Jessen,
2001) and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes (De Wit,
Pouwer, Gemke, Delemarre-van de Waal, & Snoek, 2007).
Scores are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 by multiplying
by 4, with higher scores indicating a greater feeling of
well-being.
Demographic characteristics.Participants reported their age,
gender, years of education, school attendance, employment
status, marital status, sexual orientation, living arrangements,
number of children (if any), place of birth, parents' place of
birth, length of time in Canada, language spoken at home,
primary health challenges, current stressors, and reasons for
attending the group. This information was collected by a
self-report questionnaire devised for this study.
Intervention
MBCT is an empirically supported mental health interven-
tion (administered in a group format) that extends MBSR by
combining mindfulness-based strategies with elements of
cognitive therapy (Segal et al., 2012). Unlike MBSR, MBCT
is taught within a cognitive framework, placing a greater
emphasis on understanding and attending to the cognitive
and psychological aspects of experience, and incorporating
techniques and exercises from cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT; Segal et al., 2012). As stated above, the purpose of the
current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT in
reducing psychological distress and promoting well-being
for individuals living with a chronic illness and/or other
health challenges. As the participants in the current study did
not necessarily have a diagnosis of depression, minor modi-
fications were made to the MBCT intervention wherein there

was no emphasis on providing education about depression
and preventing relapse/recurrence, particularly in Session 7.
Furthermore, there was more attention to promoting cogni-
tive and psychological insights around illness experiences
and challenges in particular, and to developing skills to cope
with these, specifically skills that recognize negative think-
ing patterns, especially in Weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5.
As stated above, the structured 8-week group intervention
was conducted by two social workers (employed in the iden-
tified study settings) who possessed a depth of knowledge
and clinical experience in mindfulness and cognitive-behav-
ioral strategies, including personal experience with medita-
tion. Each session was 120 min, and included formal and
informal mindfulness practices, as well as teaching cogni-
tive-behavioral skills. Participants were assigned homework
and were expected to do a formal meditation practice for 30
to 45 min a day, 6 days a week. They were also given read-
ings and worksheets to complete and discuss in the following
sessions.
The first session of the intervention introduced the partici-
pants to mindfulness, and included the raisin exercise and
body scan. These are two different methods of building
awareness of the present moment. The raisin exercise
requires individuals to mindfully hold, examine, feel, smell,
and taste a raisin. The body scan requires individuals to lie or
sit still while slowly bringing awareness and relaxation to
each body part at a time. The second session consisted of
awareness of breath and an introduction to CBT, including
dealing with barriers to practice. The pleasant events calen-
dar was introduced for homework. The third session involved
a mindful seeing exercise, breath and body meditation, and
the CBT concepts of mind traps, wise mind, and automatic
thoughts. In the fourth session, participants were introduced
to the meditation of sound and a CBT exercise recognizing
mind traps was introduced. The fifth session included walk-
ing meditation and the 3-min breathing space. The sixth
week was devoted to a 3-hr retreat session followed by a half
hour discussion. Loving kindness practice intended to
strengthen an attitude of compassion was discussed, with the
majority of time used for silence in meditation. Participants
were also asked to complete the stressful communication
calendar. The seventh session was devoted to the concept of
being mindful with others, and included choice-less aware-
ness (i.e., perceiving things as they really are) and walking
practice. The eighth and final session consisted of a review
of the group, including intentions for ongoing practice. A list
of community resources to support continued mindfulness
practice was offered to all participants.

The data were analyzed with the SPSS for Windows, Version
20. The sample frequencies, means, and standard deviations
were calculated. To compare characteristics and baseline
study variables between those who completed the interven-
tion and those who dropped out, independent t tests for con-
tinuous data and chi-square (2) tests for categorical data
were conducted. Paired-sample t tests were calculated on the
study measures to assess the degree of change between base-
line and posttest for those participants who completed the
pretest and posttest questionnaires. Paired-sample t tests
were also calculated on the study measures to assess the
degree of change from posttest assessment to the 4-week
follow-up assessment. To correct for the use of multiple
paired-sample t tests, the Bonferroni correction formula was
calculated and indicated a significance value of p = .006 or
below.
Results
At baseline, there were no significant differences in sociode-
mographic characteristics or the baseline study variables
between those who completed the intervention and those
who dropped out. Table 3 describes the results of the paired-
sample t tests for study measures at baseline and immedi-
ately following the completion of the intervention.

Participants who completed the intervention and the posttest
assessment demonstrated a significant improvement in
scores on the ABS, t(27) = -4.21, p = .000; CES-D, t(26) =
5.84, p = .000; DASS, t(27) = 4.39, p = .000; RS, t(27) =
-4.00, p = .000; and WHO-Five, t(27) = -3.28, p = .003. The
scores obtained on the DASS subscales also demonstrated
significant improvement in participants' levels of depres-
sion, stress, and anxiety (see Table 3). Cohen's d statistic was
computed for all of the study variables (see Table 3) and
yielded a large effect size on the ABS (0.90), CES-D (1.00),
and DASS Stress subscale (0.84). In addition, a medium
effect size was obtained for the DASS Total Score (0.76),
DASS Depression subscale (0.62), DASS Anxiety subscale
(0.52), and the WHO-Five (0.65). As well, a medium effect
size was obtained for the RS (0.47) and a small effect size for
the RSES (0.36).
For Cohen's d values: d = 0.2 to 0.5, small effect; d = 0.5
to 0.8, medium effect; and d = 0.8 to 1.0, large effect.
Table 4 describes the results of the paired-sample t tests
for study measures at posttest and at a 4-week follow-up for
participants who completed the intervention and the ques-
tionnaires at all three time points: baseline, immediately pos-
tintervention, and at a 4-week follow-up. No significant
differences were observed between participant scores imme-
diately postintervention and at the 4-week follow-up, indi-
cating that observed improvements were sustained at 4
weeks posttreatment. The improvement observed on the
anxiety subscale of the DASS was not considered significant
as the significance level for the study was set at p = .006 or
below, based on the Bonferroni correction.
Discussion
The findings from this pilot study suggest that MBCT is a
promising intervention for individuals seeking treatment in
primary health care settings who are experiencing elevated
levels of psychological distress in the context of chronic ill-
ness and/or other stressful health-related challenges. As
hypothesized, participants experienced significantly
decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as
significantly increased levels of resilience and well-being
following the completion of the 8-week MBCT intervention.
The overall effect size for depression, positive mood states,
and stress was large, and is comparable with previous studies
that have also documented large effect sizes for depression
following MBCT (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kenny & Williams,
2007). These gains were also sustained 1 month following
completion of the study intervention. The sustained improve-
ment may be related to continued practice of MBCT skills
that were acquired over the 8-week intervention although the
degree to which individuals engaged in MBCT practice fol-
lowing the intervention is unknown.
It is noteworthy that scores for depression and anxiety in
the current study population were high and comparable with
those reported in the literature for other chronic illness popu-
lations, such as HIV/AIDS (Plach, Stevens, & Heidrich,
2006), chronic pain (R. Taylor, Lovibond, Nicholas, Cayley,
& Wilson, 2005), multiple sclerosis (Chwastiak et al., 2002),
diabetes (Glasgow, Boles, Mckay, Feil, & Barrera, 2003;
Wagner et al., 2001), as well as irritable bowel syndrome
(Nickel et al., 2010), underlining the similarities between the
current sample and other normative studies. Taken together,
these results convey a high level of mental health need
among individuals with chronic illness and other health
challenges.
Specifically, all participants in the present study experi-
enced psychological distress and many experienced symp-
toms of depression and anxiety in the context of chronic
illness and physical symptoms. It is well known that comor-
bid anxiety and depression in the context of chronic illness
greatly increases the likelihood that individuals will experi-
ence increased medical symptoms, such as increased pain,
angina, dyspnea, as well as poor self-care (Katon, Lin, &
Kroenke, 2007). Furthermore, comorbid mental health prob-
lems, including psychological distress, constitute significant
risk factors that can negatively affect the capacity for work,

socioeconomic status, and social support; dramatically
affecting overall quality of life (Brands et al., 2007; Egede &
Ellis, 2010; Livneh et al., 2004; Munir et al., 2007) and fur-
ther emphasizing the profound need for early mental health
intervention in primary care.
The results of this study add to the emerging body of evi-
dence that suggests that MBCT is likely an effective low
intensity mental health intervention that can be adopted in
primary health care settings. This is one of very few studies
that have evaluated MBCT with individuals who experi-
enced psychological distress in the context of chronic illness,
physical symptoms, and life stressors, implemented by pri-
mary care frontline clinicians within a primary health care
setting. Although there is a scarcity of studies undertaken in
primary care, the current findings align with two studies that
have previously evaluated MBCT in primary care settings
(Finucane & Mercer, 2006; Radford et al., 2012). It is impor-
tant to note that these two studies evaluated MBCT in pri-
mary care where individuals were living with recurrent
depression and anxiety in the absence of comorbid chronic
illness (Finucane & Mercer, 2006; Radford et al., 2012),
unlike the current study where the majority of individuals
were living with comorbid medical conditions, as well as
psychological distress and stressful life circumstances. These
studies also demonstrated an improvement in anxiety and
depressive symptoms.
The application of MBCT to a range of clinical popula-
tions in primary care settings is a logical extension of MBCT.
MBCT was developed to address the chronic and relapsing
nature of depression over time and specifically to prevent
recurrence. The theoretical orientation of MBCT takes into
account the capacity to recognize and disengage from depres-
sive and ruminative thought patterns, which underlie depres-
sion and psychological distress, through engaging in
mindfulness, an approach that has been found to effectively
prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes (Chiesa &
Serretti, 2011; Segal et al., 2012). Psychological distress and
depression are commonly experienced by many living with
chronic medical conditions and across a broad spectrum of
challenging health problems. As such, implementing MBCT
in primary care promises to offer ready access to treatment
that has the potential to prevent the chronic and disabling
course of depression and distress in these populations.
Current health care policy emphasizes the need to reorient
health care toward prevention rather than waiting to intervene
in periods of acute illness. Furthermore, it is well recognized
that approaches directed toward building competence, self-
responsibility, and positive behavioral change are highly bene-
ficial to at-risk individuals, helping them to take control of their
overall health to better manage their lives (Khanlou, 2003;
McCabe Ruff & Mackenzie, 2009; WHO, World Organization
of National Colleges, Academies, & Academic Associations of
General Practitioners/Family Physicians, 2008). The findings
from this study suggest that MBCT supports the orientation
toward competence and self-responsibility, as evidenced by
significantly improved levels of resilience (the internalized
sense of capacity to withstand stress and manage challenge;
Wagnild & Young, 1993) and well-being following participa-
tion in the MBCT intervention.
The results also underline the broader issue of building
capacity among health care providers in delivering psycho-
logical interventions, such as MBCT. In this pilot study, the
intervention was delivered by two social workers but could
be provided by other members of the health care team, such
as registered nurses or family physicians, with adequate
training and personal commitment to ongoing mindfulness
practice. Increasing the number of health care providers who
work in primary care and who are trained in MBCT can
enhance much-needed access to mental health services in a
manner that is acceptable and accessible. Given the limited
availability and cost of mental health care in tertiary care set-
tings, the integration of MBCT within primary care to treat
psychological distress for clients experiencing chronic ill-
ness has been identified as an imperative that is both feasible
(Naylor et al., 2012; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013) and effec-
tive (Radford et al., 2012).
Limitations
This study used a pre­posttest design to evaluate the effec-
tivenesss of MBCT in primary care and did not include a
control group, and consequently the findings cannot be
directly attributed to participation in MBCT. Another limita-
tion is the relatively small sample size, which reduces the
generalizability of the current study findings. Future research
studies evaluating MBCT in primary care would benefit
from the addition of a control group and a larger sample, to
provide increased confidence regarding the study findings.
Further details regarding MBCT practice, such as continued
homework, were not explored and would provide additional
understanding regarding the mechanisms of change observed
in the current study.
Conclusion
Despite the study limitations, MBCT is likely an effective
intervention that can reduce psychological distress and
improve well-being in primary care settings for a broad spec-
trum of the population seeking care in primary care. Restricted
access to mental health services is a serious public health
problem. MBCT, when delivered within primary health care
settings, can be made available to those who otherwise would
not be able to gain access to mental health care. Continued
focus on how to best implement MBCT in primary health care,
particularly for those with comorbid physical and mental
health conditions, supports the World Health Organization's
(WHO, World Organization of National Colleges, Academies,
& Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family
Physicians, 2008) recommendation to integrate evidence-
based mental health care within primary health care to
McCay et al. 9
promote equitable access to care for those most in need. Given
the magnitude and chronicity of mental health problems
worldwide (Chapman et al., 2005; Monroe et al., 2007;
Roberge et al., 2011), the importance of policy relevant
research focusing on scaling up MBCT to other primary health
care programs and sectors should not be overlooked. The cur-
rent study highlights the potential of MBCT to equip individu-
als with a range of skills to manage their distress early in the
illness trajectory, thus averting serious mental health problems
and contributing to an improved quality of life.
