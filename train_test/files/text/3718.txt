Abstract
Among Veterans, heart failure (HF) contributes to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalization. Dual health care
system use (dual use) occurs when Veterans Health Administration (VA) enrollees also receive care from non-VA sources.
Mounting evidence suggests that dual use decreases efficiency and patient safety. This qualitative study used constructivist
grounded theory and content analysis to examine decision making among 25 Veterans with HF, for similarities and differences
between all-VA users and dual users. In general, all-VA users praised specific VA providers, called services helpful, and
expressed positive capacity for managing HF. In addition, several Veterans who described inadvertent one-time non-VA
health care utilization in emergent situations more closely mirrored all-VA users. By contrast, committed dual users more
often reported unmet needs, nonresponse to VA requests, and faster services in non-VA facilities. However, a primary
trigger for dual use was VA telephone referral for escalating symptoms, instead of care coordination or primary/specialty
care problem-solving.

Original Research
Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent chronic disease
afflicting over 5 million Americans.1 There are approxi-
mately 650 000 new cases of HF per year in the United
States, and adults aged 40 years and older face a ~20% life-
time risk of developing this disease.2,3 HF causes over 800
000 emergency department (ED) visits and over 1.1 million
hospitalizations each year with total estimated costs for HF
care reaching $32 billion.4-6 Approximately 20.4% of
Medicare patients hospitalized for HF are rehospitalized
within 30 days.7 After HF hospitalization, overall 30-day
mortality is approximately 8.8%, and HF patients have a
5-year mortality rate that approaches 50%.3,8
A variety of factors predict HF hospitalization, hospital
readmission, and mortality, including age, gender, New York
Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection
fraction, comorbid medical conditions, and measures of hos-
pital quality.7,9-16 In addition, dual health care system use
(dual use) is an emerging health system­related factor asso-
ciated with higher health care utilization and worse outcomes
for several diseases. For example, almost 20% of Medicare
patients rehospitalized within 30 days after an HF hospital
admission are admitted to different facilities on their second
stay.17 Thus, the decisions patients make regarding when and
where to receive acute care for chronic conditions such as
HF can have a significant impact on their subsequent health
care utilization and outcomes.
Within the Veteran Health Administration (VA), dual use
occurs when patients receive care from multiple providers or
health care facilities as well as the VA. Dual use is particu-
larly common in the VA health system where a majority of
hospitalizations for cardiovascular disorders among older
Veterans occur at non-VA facilities.18 Compared with
VA-only users of acute care, Veterans with HF who were
dual users had 15% higher adjusted rates of ED visits, 40%

higher rates of hospital admission for HF, and 46% higher
rates of all-cause 30-day readmission.19 Although HF is a
leading cause for hospital admission, readmission, costs, and
mortality in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System,20 there
have been relatively few studies that have solicited Veteran
perceptions of such HF-related issues.21 This article exam-
ines how Veterans make decisions to seek care as their symp-
toms escalate. In addition, though there are a few studies of
dual use of VA and non-VA health services by Veterans with
HF, we could locate none from the Veteran's perspective.22
Although a limited sample (n = 25), this exploratory, descrip-
tive qualitative study compares the perspectives of Veterans
who used only VAcare, Veterans who described an unplanned
use of non-VA service in a single emergency, and Veterans
who identified as usual dual users. The patterns that appeared
within the dual user group compared with the other 2 groups
suggest specific descriptive evidence for the design and test-
ing of future interventions, a potentially relevant pattern that
may contribute to more patient-centered HF interventions to
improve VA health services.
Methods
Most studies of dual use to date have analyzed secondary
data to establish patterns of health care utilization and to
measure health care outcomes.23-28 However, much less is
known regarding the subjective factors leading Veterans to
seek care across health care systems. To better understand
care seeking decisions among Veterans with HF and to
explore differences in decision making between single and
dual system users, we conducted a qualitative study of
Veterans with HF at 2 VA medical centers. This study drew
from both conventional qualitative content analysis and con-
structivist grounded theory to explore perceived similarities
and differences between Veterans who had single and dual
use of VA and non-VA services as broadly as possible.29,30
Rather than apply a preestablished theoretical framework,
grounded theory supplies a logic of data collection, constant
comparison of developing concepts, and reflective analysis
that generates an emerging framework in its final results.31
Separate coders applied the 2 primary qualitative methods
and negotiated a consensus between content analysis and
grounded theory­based findings, using the computer-assisted
qualitative content analysis program and Web-based corpus
analysis tool Wmatrix for triangulation.32
Study Data and Interpretation
Selection of Participants
Veteran subjects for this analysis were recruited from VA
Medical Centers in the southern United States. Beginning in
May 2014, approved by the VA Central Institutional Review
Board (CIRB), we created a purposive sample of subjects
identified through 3 mechanisms: (1) review of existing
patient registries of those previously receiving care for
chronic HF, (2) review of inpatient census documents for
patients hospitalized with HF, and (3) posting advertisements
in patient care areas of our facilities. Potentially eligible
patients lived in specific geographic regions, had a diagnosis
of HF, and had received treatment within the preceding year.
They were mailed a letter of recruitment or approached in
inpatient settings (after an introduction facilitated by clinical
staff). Individuals responding with interest to these recruit-
ment efforts were contacted by a study team member who
screened subjects for eligibility to participate by reviewing
questions related to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects
with limited English proficiency or who were unable to pro-
vide individual informed consent were excluded from par-
ticipation in semistructured interviews, as they would likely
be unable to complete study procedures. Subsequently, con-
senting participants were scheduled for interviews conducted
in person or via telephone.
Semistructured Interviews
Interviews were developed using constructivist grounded
theory.30 After obtaining basic demographic information,
open-ended questions explored how Veterans perceived their
heart condition, how they managed HF, what influenced their
decision to seek emergency assistance, and how they made
the choice to use VA- versus non-VA services, based on a
standard interview guide shown in Table 1. Two interviewers
with previous experience in qualitative studies conducted
semistructured interviews lasting 30 to 60 minutes, using
principles of qualitative interviewing. Interviews were digi-
tally recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo Version
10 software for coding.33,34
Qualitative Analyses
Two coders planned parallel coding for the broadest per-
spective possible, using separate approaches to coding in a
first pass, and then negotiated and refined codes in a pro-
cess of consensus coding.35 The first coder used classic
qualitative content analysis to explore the text from a
health services perspective by selecting codes deductively
in response to the research question, pretesting codes on a
few transcribed interviews, applying the codes completely,
and creating a case by case variable matrix from emerging
categories.36 Using a more inductive approach, the second
coder used constructivist grounded theory, reexamining
language for specific views, values, what actions were rep-
resented, relationships implied, positions taken, and what
was unsaid.30
Transcriptions were coded line by line, grouped into cat-
egories, and subsequently examined for emerging themes
using constant comparison. Veterans were initially sorted
into single- versus dual-users of services for purposes of
analysis. During analysis, it became evident that a sizable
Pope et al 3
number of Veterans initially categorized as dual-users had
instead accessed non-VA services only during a critical inci-
dent and then returned to acting as VA single-users for fol-
low-up care by preference.
Computer-Assisted Qualitative Content Analysis
As an additional point of comparison for triangulation, a
third coder, an applied linguist, used an online linguistics-
based tool, Wmatrix, to compare computer-assisted qualita-
tive content analysis and grounded theory findings of the
texts, with quantitative comparison of language patterns
between the 2 sets of health service research coders. Wmatrix
helped identify significant conceptual themes, commonali-
ties, and differences suggested by word use as a complemen-
tary analysis to the consensus reached by the initial content
analysis and grounded theory coding. Wmatrix tags every
word in a text by its part of speech and also its semantic cat-
egory and measures their frequencies of use for compari-
sons.32 In comparing language used by single- versus
dual-users, Wmatrix provides a means to apply log-likeli-
hood analysis to identify statistically significant keywords
and key semantic fields (such as Time or Emotion). The
identification of significant keywords and semantic fields is
complementary to the analysis of themes identified by con-
tent analysis and grounded theory, refining their identifica-
tion and reducing potential investigator bias.

Veterans aged 51 to 88 years. Nine subjects were only VA
users, six were committed dual users, and 10 were inadver-
tent one-time dual users.
Findings From Grounded Theory Analysis
In reviewing all interviews, we noticed that participants in all
groups exhibited low levels of engagement with their pri-
mary care providers for problem solving, which can contrib-
ute to increased use of the ED for symptom management in
general and during the early stages of an exacerbation.
Symptom escalation was often not perceived as recognized
by Veterans. Self-management was clearly a concern, as
shown in the patterns we identified for consistent only-VA
users, consistent dual users, and inadvertent one-time dual
users. This last category of Veterans, inadvertent dual users,
often sought care in response to a critical incident. They
described being pressured by family or from a member of
their social network to seek care at the closest available facil-
ity for rising symptoms, fear, or a feeling of being over-
whelmed. Several were taken to non-VA facilities by the
emergency medical service they contacted for transportation.
Often patients had not called VA Primary Care for consulta-
tion about emerging symptoms, a consistent pattern across
users, but waited until the ED was the necessary choice.
Table 3 exemplifies precipitating factors leading Veterans in
all 3 categories to seek care.
Both the exclusively single users and inadvertent one-
time dual users had specific reasons for selecting VA care,
keyed to its perceived quality, as shown in Table 4. Although
often concerned about delays with specialty care, they were
less concerned about wait-time for general VA services.
Consistent dual users who planned to remain in that cate-
gory reported that they had their own insurance and did not
feel limited to either the VA or to the closest available medi-
cal care. Like single and inadvertent one-time users, they
waited until escalating symptoms, such as lack of breath,
caused them to seek care, and displayed little personal
agency, being content to go wherever an ambulance, family
member, or friend took them. They were more likely to cite
lack of access to VA primary care and difficulty scheduling
as main reasons for choosing non-VA care, keyed to frustra-
tion with access to services, as shown in Table 4.
Findings From Computer-Assisted Content
Analysis
Using Wmatrix for triangulation, semantic fields identified
for both single and dual users shared many similarities, as
members of each group were being asked similar questions.
In both groups, word usage falls into identical conceptual or
semantic clusters keyed to identity in the interview questions.
These conceptual clusters included comparisons of hospitals
and their staffs, listing of symptoms leading to hospitaliza-
tion, reports on what clinicians had told them, descriptions
contrasting ease or difficulty in gaining admission to medical
treatment, listing of chronic conditions including HF, how the
heart condition escalated, highlights in the Veteran's heart
disease story, and evaluation of the hospitals and their care.
Dual-users' words were significantly more likely to fall
into the category for Evaluation. To further examine the cat-
egory of Evaluation, we extracted the answers by all 25
Veterans to the question, "Can you describe the quality of
care you received" and compared those against the full text
of all of the interviews. That comparison underscored that
speakers were inclined to report what others said about their
condition, and had strong concerns about getting appoint-
ments and being seen in a timely fashion. For the 50 words
identified as semantically evaluative in the responses to
Quality of Care, we noted that Okay was used to close a
question-answer sequence, Well was used to open a topic or
to signal slight hesitation before giving an opinion, but the
other words characterized the quality of care as being of high
value. Interestingly, Veterans who were dissatisfied with the
VA did not use words such as Poor; instead, they launched
immediately into uninterrupted monologues on one of 3 con-
ceptual themes: the difficulty of obtaining appointments, of
getting clear answers, or being seen within a time they saw as
reasonable. Overall, the theme of symptom escalation
emerged as a precipitating factor that triggered ED use, yet
had a described trajectory open to intervention. However, the
Veterans'statements suggest a lack of recognition or response
early in the symptom cycle.
The theme of symptom escalation emerged as a precipitat-
ing factor that triggered ED use (as seen in Table 3), yet had a
described trajectory open to earlier problem solving or inter-
vention. However, the Veterans' statements suggest a lack of
recognition or willingness to respond early in the cycle.
I started sweating at night, I mean, a whole lot of sweat. And I
got kind of skeptical, but then the sweating and then it started
turning into that real bad feeling.
This typical example suggests a process that was noticed,
reflected upon, escalated, but not acted upon until the final
"bad feeling," without primary care consultation. Another
dimension of this decision-making process reflects a lack of
care coordination within the multiple services often needed
for persons with HF, reflected in this example in which the
physician in the primary care clinic goes unmentioned or
mistakenly identified as one of many specialists.
Interviewer: "Did you go to your primary care doctor or
heart specialist before or after your emergency depart-
ment visit?"
Veteran: "Well, the emergency department, they admitted
me into the hospital and then the heart specialist came
by and determined that's what it was and that I didn't
need any special treatment or medication . . . Well, my
primary care doctor is in nephrology, so I very seldom
Pope et al 5
see him. I see him once a month maybe when he makes
his rounds up in the dialysis unit. Every decision I
make I make it on my own because I've really never
been to see a heart specialist. You understand? You
know, they make appointments, they do an EKG and
he looks at it and that's it. As far as sitting down and
talking and explaining to me exactly what the problem
is or what may have caused it, no, I never got that
information."
Another theme that affected choice of care across the 3
groups was related to accessing care, especially through the
VA Telephone Advice Program (TAP), the patient informa-
tion service available at all VA medical centers 24 hours a
day. Though committed dual users expressed some frustra-
tion, study participants in the other 2 groups referred to TAP
rarely.
Others portrayed that some VA telephone access had
improved.
Table 4. Reasons for Choosing Care in Only-VA Users and Inadvertent One-Time Dual Users Versus Consistent Dual Users.
Theme Representative quote
VA-only and one-time dual users
 Quality overall: overall
satisfaction with quality of care
The doctor comes out there and she sees me and she knows I have an appointment. "Come
on." Can I do that with anybody else? No. I'm very pleased with the service that I get for my
heart . . . I would not change it for any other hospital.
 Quality as equity: perceived
equity as part of quality of care
Well, I mean, they go right to work on you. They just handle you very professionally. There's
no color, creed or what have you. They handle you as a patient.
 Quality in decisions: decision
to choose VA based on quality
of care
Right now the reason for my decision to come to the VA is because I just overall get better
service. When I come to the VA, I feel that if I'm in a detrimental situation, I'll be seen.
Going to the private emergency room, they don't get to you that quickly.
 Quality as information: better
communication with often
named providers and can echo
directives or explanations
The heart specialist and my diabetic specialist, nurses and doctors and all them made me
extremely aware over the last four years of what I had to be aware of, the symptoms and
when I need to get in here to the doctor. Weight gain, fast weight gain is another symptom
of retaining fluid around my heart.
 Quality as replacing insurance
concerns
Money. I couldn't afford the outside insurance. Me and my wife, we spend over $1000 a
month, and I couldn't afford that . . .
Dual users
 Lack of access to primary care I'm tired. I use the emergency room for my primary care physician, but that's not right. That's
the only way I can get to see a doctor is go to the emergency room. You go down there and
you sit and somebody says, "What are you in here for today?"
And the other thing is the TAP [Telephone Advice Program] number or the nurse? The help
for after hours? It doesn't matter what you say to them, when you're done they say, "Go to
the emergency room."
 Scheduling problems I can't get an appointment. I had an appointment August 20th, believe it or not, made back in
April, I think. But August 20th, that's how far ahead I had to go. But then I got a call Friday
cancelling that. I said, "Where's he going to be?" "He's out of town." And she said, "When
do you want to come back?" I said, "I do not give a damn. Send me a letter, whatever you
want to," and hung up.
Note. VA = Veterans Health Administration.
Table 3. Factors Precipitating Veterans' Decisions to Seek Heart Failure Care.
Themes of decision making Representative quote
Symptom escalation: sweating So after I started to have that real bad feeling and sweating because, I mean, I'd wake up soaking
wet, and that's when I called the VA. From the sweating, and then when I got to feeling real bad,
they got an 800 number to call the nurse, and I called them and explained to them what's going on.
Symptom escalation: breathing That's more or less I just couldn't breathe. I couldn't catch my breath. I was just sitting there in the
bed and I went to go use the bathroom. I came and sat down on the bed. I just couldn't catch my
breath and I didn't know what was going on. That was when it first happened.
Symptom escalation: choices
driven by providers
I didn't decide. The doctor in California decided, sent me to a VA after they found out that I was
a Veteran. They decided to send me to a VA for better service and a cheaper service, and it was
done for me. I did not decide because I had no idea of ever being sick.
Note. VA = Veterans Health Administration.
6 INQUIRY
The other thing I'm finding is that it used to be you'd wait an
hour or so on the phone to talk to somebody at the VA. You don't
have that wait period right now, which is a bit better. Nobody
minds waiting 10 or 15 minutes, but you wait an hour, hour and
a half to talk to somebody, that's . . . a bit much.
Discussion
In this article, we have presented findings from a qualitative
study of decision making regarding care seeking among
Veterans with HF. By using complementary approaches to
analysis and interpretation, we identified key words, key
themes, and prevalent discourse patterns. Not surprisingly,
dual users chose negative words (including taboo words) to
describe their experience, keyed primarily to a lack of satis-
faction with delays in service, and resistance to being consis-
tently sent to the ED when calling with a problem. They
apparently had impersonal relations with providers, tending
not to know their names. Feeling that quality of care was low,
and having insurance of their own, they consistently chose
care outside the VA whenever it was available or as more
convenient geographically. Dual users were more likely to
criticize the VA Telephone Advice Program known as the
TAP line for providing nurses who invariably sent them to
emergency care and were highly dissatisfied with not getting
what they saw as clear answers. Single users tended to have
no private medical insurance, and though sometimes irritated
by consistent delays in getting appointments and receiving
care, they felt that the care they received was well-worth it,
even "wonderful" on occasion, primarily because of strong
relationships with providers, whom they named and enjoyed
seeing. They largely felt that providers gave clear answers,
saw them as individual persons of importance, and were pre-
pared to provide care for them.
Many of our findings echo key themes identified in other
studies of care seeking decisions in HF patients.37,38 Many of
our patients described confusion in interpreting symptoms or
their severity until emergent care was necessary, a finding
described previously.39-41 Separate reports also describe
avoidance-based coping, fear of hospitals, fear of being a
burden, and depression as additional barriers to timely care
seeking in HF.37,42 As modeled by only-VA users in our sam-
ple, healthy engagement in primary care has also been
described previously as a positive factor in promoting HF
self-management.43 Although much of the qualitative litera-
ture to date focuses on factors associated with decisions to
seek care and delays in care seeking, our study focused on
the slightly narrower question of choice of care setting.
However, to the extent that dual use is a marker of increased
need for health care services, it is beneficial to better under-
stand these discrete decisions.
Counter to a priori expectations, we discovered that
patients fell into 3 distinct groups rather than 2 groups. In
addition to consistent dual-users and only-VA users, we
observed multiple patients to be inadvertent one-time dual
users. This third group typically responded to questions in
the same manner as the only-VA group but had exposure to
non-VA health care during times of acute HF exacerbation.
The implications of this health care utilization pattern are as
yet unclear, as compared with the other 2 groups. Yet the
inadvertent one-time dual users presented opportunities for
care coordination that could conceivably decrease avoidable
ED use, a potential hypothesis for testing. Most studies of
dual health care system used to date that examine secondary
data have focused on categorical (yes/no) definitions of dual
use. Our qualitative observations indicate that there may be
important experiential and motivational differences between
consistent dual users and inadvertent dual users, which could
impact outcomes of care as well as potential interventions.
This hypothesis will need further analysis and exploration
using quantitative methods.
This study should be interpreted in light of certain limita-
tions. Grounded theory methods consist of systematic guide-
lines for iteratively collecting and analyzing qualitative data
to construct theories from interview data that are exploratory
in nature.30 This study involved interviews from 25 predomi-
nantly male Veterans from 2 VA medical centers. While our
sample was adequate to achieve thematic saturation, extrapo-
lation of our findings to other VA medical centers or to
female Veterans should be done with caution. Other than
grouping patients based on their dual use status, we did not
make any attempts to assess clinical outcomes for patients in
our sample. Thus, we cannot comment on the impact of dual
use or single system use on quality of care or outcomes for
these participants. Separately, our research team is also per-
forming quantitative dual use analyses on a cohort of over 13
000 Veterans with HF, and these analyses should comple-
ment our qualitative findings.19
In closing, this qualitative study sheds new light on fac-
tors affecting decision making in Veterans with HF regarding
the VA system of health care. These findings are timely given
the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act (VACA)
and increased dual use among Veterans entitled.44 Further
study regarding the implications of inadvertent dual system
use seems warranted. Future interventions to improve symp-
tom recognition in HF, early and effective triage during exac-
erbation, and effective primary care engagement may enable
decreased dual use in situations that may be less effective for
Veterans as well as decrease preventable ED visits while
managing HF.
