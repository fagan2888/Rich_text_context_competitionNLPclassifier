Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer worldwide, and metastasis develops in 50% of the
patients.1,2 The most frequent sites of metastasis are the
liver and lungs. CRC patients with untreated metastatic can-
cer have a median survival period of less than 10 months
and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%.3,4 In particular,
lung metastasis is seen in 10% to 20% of patients with CRC,
and studies have reported 5-year survival rates of 24% to
64% in patients who have undergone resection.5,6 In the past
13 years (1999-2011), the age-standardized incidence rates
of CRC have increased from 20.4 to 37.8% in Korea. Along

Abstract
Background: -Lapachone is a quinone-containing compound found in red lapacho (Tabebuia impetiginosa, syn. T
avellanedae) trees. Lapacho has been used in traditional medicine by several South and Central American indigenous people
to treat various types of cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimetastatic properties of -lapachone
and the underlying mechanisms using colon cancer cells. Methods: This research used metastatic murine colon cancer
cell lines, colon 26 (CT26) and colon 38 (MC38). A WST assay, annexin V assay, cell cycle analysis, wound healing assay,
invasion assay, western blot analysis, and real-time reverse transcription­polymerase chain reaction were performed
to examine the effects of -lapachone on metastatic phenotypes and molecular mechanisms. The effect of -lapachone
on lung metastasis was assessed in a mouse experimental metastasis model. Results: We found that the inhibition of
proliferation of the colon cancer cell lines by -lapachone was due to the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
-Lapachone induced the apoptosis of CT26 cells through caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
cleavage; and downregulation of the Bcl-2 family in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, a low concentration
of -lapachone decreased the cell migration and invasion by decreasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and
-9, and increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 and -2. Moreover, -lapachone treatment
regulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as E- and N-cadherin, vimentin, -catenin, and
Snail in CT26 cells. In the mouse experimental metastasis model, -lapachone significantly inhibited the lung metastasis of
CT26 cells. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the inhibitory effect of -lapachone on colorectal lung metastasis.
This compound may be useful for developing therapeutic agents to treat metastatic cancer.

with the significant increases in the incidence rates of CRC,
mortality rates have also continued to increase.7
Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the primary
lesion to remote organs, and abnormally fast growth of
metastases is the most harmful aspect of cancer.8 Metastasis
is a complex process of cancer cells spreading from a primary
site and forming tumors at distant sites. It occurs through a
multistep process by which primary tumor cells lose cellular
adhesion and increase cellular motility. To metastasize into
distant tissues, cancer cells need to acquire special properties
that would enable them to invade the extracellular matrix
(ECM), migrate to and invade lymph nodes and blood ves-
sels, and then adhere and survive in target organs.9
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important extra-
cellular proteases that can trigger the degradation of ECM
and provide a pathway for cancer cells to migrate, invade,
and spread to distant organs.10 Tissue inhibitors of metallo-
proteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous inhibitors of the
hydrolytic activities of MMPs and are consequently impor-
tant regulators of ECM turnover, tissue remodeling, and
cellular behavior.11,12 Therefore, the role of MMPs and
TIMPs is important during the migration and invasion steps
of the metastatic process.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular
process in which epithelial cells appear as mesenchymal
cells during cancer progression and metastasis.13,14
Advanced tumor cells frequently exhibit marked downregu-
lation of epithelial markers and a loss of intercellular junc-
tions, resulting in a loss of epithelial polarity and reduced
intercellular adhesion.15 The loss of epithelial features is
often accompanied by increased cell motility and expres-
sion of mesenchymal genes. EMT regulatory transcription
factors, including -catenin, Snail, and Slug, change the
epithelial gene expression profile, decrease the expression
of genes encoding epithelial cell-cell adhesion complexes
and cytokeratins, and increase the expression of genes
encoding mesenchymal markers.16,17 These factors are
expressed in various cancer types such as breast cancer,
colon cancer, and melanoma.18-20
Induction of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest is important
for tumor suppression.21 Synthetic inhibitors of cyclins
and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) induce cell cycle
arrest and could be therefore useful as anticancer agents.22
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death, which
changes the cell morphology, induces nuclear and DNA
fragmentation and chromatin condensation, and ultimately
leads to cell death. Apoptotic cells are eliminated by
phagocytes such as macrophages, without eliciting inflam-
mation, whereas necrotic cells release products of cell
death, which promote an inflammatory response.23
Therefore, induction of cancer cell apoptosis is considered
a therapeutic method against the progression of cancer.
Various natural products and compounds can induce apop-
tosis by regulating the expression of apoptotic or cell
cycle­related factors in cancer cells.24
Lapacho trees (Tabebuia impetiginosa, syn. T avellane-
dae), native to South America, have been used in traditional
medicine by South and Central Americans for thousands of
years. This plant has been used to treat bacterial infections,
fever, malaria, and stomach diseases, as well as several types
of cancer.25 -Lapachone, a natural quinone compound, is the
main bioactive compound obtained from lapacho trees. It
shows various pharmacological effects, including antibacte-
rial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities.26-29
In particular, this compound has been considered one of the
main antitumor compounds and investigated to elucidate its
antitumor effects and mechanisms. -Lapachone selectively
induces apoptotic death in various cancer cells, including
breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia.30,31 Moreover,
-lapachone also shows antitumor effects in human colon
cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a
sirtuin 1­forkhead box O1 or a caspase-mediated pathway,
along with the elevation of either quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1) or death receptor 5 levels.25 However, the antimeta-
static effects of -lapachone have been rarely reported, and
the effect of -lapachone on colorectal metastasis has not
been clarified.32,33 Therefore, we investigated the antimeta-
static effect and mechanism of -lapachone action using
metastatic colon cancer cell lines and a mouse experimental
metastasis model.
Materials and Methods
Antibodies and Reagents
Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, and
caspase-8 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc (Danvers, MA). Caspase-9 antibody was
purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY).
B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) antibody was purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Bcl-xL,
Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and -tubulin antibodies
were purchased from Bioworld Technology (Louis Park,
MN). -Lapachone was chemically synthesized by KT&G
Life Science (Suwon, Korea).
Cell Culture
The mouse colon carcinoma cell lines colon 26 (CT26) and
colon 38 (MC38) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin
and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO
2
incubator.
Animals
BALB/c female mice (5 weeks old, 19-20 g) were pur-
chased from Da-Mool Science (Daejeon, Korea). They
were housed, 6 per cage, in a laminar airflow room
Kee et al 587
maintained at a temperature of 22 ± 1°C and a relative
humidity of 55 ± 1% throughout the study. The research
was conducted in accordance with the internationally
accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as
stated in the Wonkwang University guidelines
(WKU14-15).
Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was quantified using the cell proliferation
reagent WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-
nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,
monosodium salt] (Enzo Life Sciences). Cells were seeded
in 96-well microplates at 3 × 103 cells/well, and a
-lapachone-containing medium was added to the wells.
After the incubation, the medium was changed, followed
by the addition of a WST-8 solution, and absorbance was
measured at 450 nm.
Annexin V Assay
Annexin V assay was carried out using FITC Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA).
Harvested cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in 1× Annexin
V binding buffer (1 × 106 cells/mL). Then, 100 µL of the
suspension (1 × 105 cells) was transferred to a 5-mL culture
tube and labeled with 3 µL of a titrated fluorescein isothio-
cyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide
(PI) staining solution. The cells were vortexed and incu-
bated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The
volume was then adjusted to 500 µL, and the cells were
analyzed using a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Western Blot Analysis
CT26 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with vari-
ous concentrations of -lapachone. The stimulated cells
were rinsed with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer
(iNtRon Biotech, Seoul, Korea) for 1 hour. The cell
lysates were centrifuged 13000 rpm for 10 minutes, and
the quantity of protein in the cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions was evaluated using a bicinchoninic acid protein
assay. The supernatant was mixed with 2× sample buffer,
then proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked
with 5% skim milk for 1.5 hours and incubated for 3
hours with primary antibodies. The bound antibodies
were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and IgG antibodies (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) using an enhanced chemilumines-
cence system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Cell Cycle Analysis
The cell cycle distribution was assessed using the Muse cell
cycle kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. CT26 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in
6-well plates and incubated with various concentrations of
-lapachone for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and
fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol at -20°C for at least 3
hours. After washing with PBS, the cell pellets were resus-
pended in 200 µL of the cell cycle reagent and incubated for
30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The cells were
analyzed using a Muse cell analyzer, and the cell cycle
phase distribution was quantified using the Muse analysis
software (Millipore).
Real-Time Reverse Transcription (RT)­
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using an RNA-spin total RNA
extraction kit (iNtRon Biotech) according to the manufac-
turer's directions. First-strand cDNA was prepared from an
RNA template (2 µg) using an oligo(dT)18 primer and a
Power cDNA synthesis kit (iNtRon Biotech). RT was per-
formed at 42°C for 50 minutes and then at 70°C for 15 min-
utes. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using
Power SYBR Green PCR master mix and a StepOnePlus
real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). All data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The
primer sequences are summarized in Table 1.
Wound Healing Assay
CT26 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well)
to form a monolayer. Using a 200 µL pipet tip, a scratch of
~1-mm width was made in triplicate. The detached cells
were removed, and the attached cells were incubated in
serum-free medium containing -lapachone at the indicated
concentrations. The scratches were monitored at regular
intervals over a course of 0 to 24 hours, and images were
acquired under phase-contrast microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany).
Invasion Assay
The invasion ability of cancer cells was estimated using a BD
BioCoat GFR matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences).
CT26 cells (5 × 104 cells) were suspended in serum-free
DMEM with -lapachone (10 and 100 nM) and added to the
upper part of the transwell chamber. For the invasion assay,
the lower part of the transwell was filled with DMEM con-
taining 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 24 hours of
incubation, the membrane inserts were washed twice with
PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min-
utes. After washing twice with PBS, the fixed cells were
treated with 100% methanol for 20 minutes and stained with
588 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(4)
Giemsa stain for 15 minutes. The inner side of the chambers
was wiped with a cotton swab. The membrane inserts were
dried and observed under a microscope (Leica).
Gelatin Zymography
Activity of MMPs was assayed by gelatin zymography
using a zymogram buffer kit (Koma Biotech, Seoul, Korea).
Cells (5 × 105 cells) were seeded in 6-well plates and stabi-
lized in serum-free medium overnight. After -lapachone
treatment for 24 hours, the conditioned medium was col-
lected. Samples were mixed with 2× sample buffer and
electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1%
gelatin. The gels were washed with renaturing buffer for 15
minutes and incubated in developing buffer at 37°C for 24
hours. The gel was stained with a Coomassie blue R-250
solution for 30 minutes and destained with destaining buffer
(50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 40% distilled water)
for 30 minutes. The gelatinolytic activity of MMPs was
photographed using a digital imaging system.
Experimental Lung Metastasis Model
For experimental lung metastasis, CT26 cells were harvested
and resuspended in PBS. Mice were intravenously inoculated
with CT26 (3 × 104 cells) in 200 µL of PBS via the lateral tail
vein. -Lapachone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were
administered by intraperitoneal injection 2 hours prior to the
injection of the cancer cells and then injected once every 2 days.
The mice were sacrificed 17 days later, and the lungs were
removed and fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO).
The increase in lung weight and the number of tumor colonies
in the lungs were measured to evaluate tumor metastasis.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the
Student's t test. P values of <.05 were considered to indicate
statistically significant differences. The mean and standard
deviation (SD) were calculated for all variables.
Results
Effect of -Lapachone on Viability of Colon Cancer
Cells
The chemical structure of -lapachone is shown in Figure
1A. To determine whether -lapachone is cytotoxic to the
metastatic colon cancer cells, we evaluated their cell viabil-
ity using the WST assay. Figure 1 shows that the treatment
with -lapachone decreased the viability of CT26 and
MC38 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure
1B and C). Moreover, apoptotic morphological changes
were detected in -lapachone-treated CT26 cells by micro-
scopic observation (Figure 1D).
Effect of -Lapachone on Apoptosis of CT26 Cells
To determine whether the inhibition of cell proliferation
by -lapachone was due to cell apoptosis, CT26 cells were
treated with -lapachone (0, 1, or 10 µM) for 9 hours, and
the annexin V assay was conducted. As shown in Figure
2A, -lapachone increased both early (lower right of Figure
2A) and late (upper right of Figure 2A) apoptosis of CT26
cells. Because -lapachone increased the annexin
V­positive CT26 cell population, the mechanism underly-
ing -lapachone-induced apoptosis was investigated by
western blot analysis. Exposure of CT26 cells to
-lapachone (1 µM) for 0 to 9 hours or to various concen-
trations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 µM) of -lapachone for 9
hours caused cleavage of caspases-3, -8, -9, and PARP. In
addition, -lapachone decreased the truncation of Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL and increased the expression level of Bax in a
time- and dose-dependent manner in CT26 cells in an
intrinsic pathway (Figure 2B and C).
Effect of -Lapachone on Cell Cycle Arrest in
CT26 Cells
To investigate whether -lapachone induces the cell
cycle arrest, flow cytometry was used to analyze the

changes in the cell cycle. CT26 cells were treated with
various concentrations of -lapachone for 24 hours, and
its DNA content was measured. It was found that,
on treatment with a high concentration (1 µM) of
-lapachone, the percentage of CT26 cells entering the
S phase was decreased and the cells were blocked in the
G0/G1 phase (Figure 3A and B). Moreover, downregu-
lation of the mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4
by -lapachone was also observed in CT26 cells
(Figure 3C).
Effect of -Lapachone on EMT Markers in
CT26 Cells
To determine whether -lapachone affects the expression of
EMT markers typical for metastatic phenotypes, mRNA
expression of EMT-related molecules was determined. As
shown in Figure 4, the expression of the epithelial pheno-
typic marker E-cadherin was increased (Figure 4A), while
that of the mesenchymal phenotypic markers N-cadherin,
vimentin, -catenin, and Snail were decreased in
-lapachone-treated CT26 cells (Figure 4B-E).

Effect of -Lapachone on Migratory and Invasive
Ability of CT26 Cells
Migration and invasion are the fundamental features of
metastasis after the EMT process. Therefore, a wound
healing assay was performed to determine whether
-lapachone suppresses the migration of CT26 cells. Cell
movements were observed 24 hours after the treatment
with -lapachone. In the presence of -lapachone, the cells
showed a decrease in collective cell migration when

compared with that of the control. The control cells
migrated toward the scratched region in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas the -lapachone (10 and 100 nM) treated
cells did not migrate (Figure 5A). The invasive ability of
CT26 cells was measured by the matrigel invasion assay.
As shown in Figure 5B, -lapachone (10 and 100 nM)
induced significant decreases in the invasion of CT26 cells.
To determine the molecular mechanism of the anti-inva-
sive ability of -lapachone, mRNA expressions of MMP-
2/9 and their inhibitor TIMP-1/2 were measured. Activities
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also determined using gelatin
zymography. -Lapachone dose-dependently inhibited the
activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 5C). The real-
time RT-PCR results showed that -lapachone treatment
suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions, and increased
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5D and E).
Effect of -Lapachone on Lung Metastasis
of CT26 Cells in an Experimental Metastasis
Model
The present study also investigated whether -lapachone
could inhibit spontaneous lung metastasis of colon cancer
cells in mice. Body weight, an indicator of toxicity, was not
changed by the injection of -lapachone (Figure 6A). As
shown in Figure 6B and C, the number of pulmonary tumor
nodules significantly was increased in the lungs of the mice
intravenously injected with CT26 cells alone. However, the
intraperitoneal injection of -lapachone (2 or 5 mg/kg) for 2
weeks significantly decreased the formation of tumor nod-
ules by about 50% or 55%, respectively. Compared to the
control group, the -lapachone-treated mice showed signifi-
cantly smaller tumors (Figure 6D). Additionally, we inves-
tigated the expression of EMT markers and MMP-2/9 in
lung tissues to determine whether the in vivo antimetastatic
effect of -lapachone is associated with the regulation of
EMT-related genes and MMP-2/9. -Lapachone adminis-
tration increased the expression of E-cadherin, whereas it
downregulated the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and
Snail (Figure 6E). Moreover, the expressions of MMP-2
and MMP-9 were also decreased in lung tissues of the
-lapachone-administered group (Figure 6F). These results
are consistent with those of the in vitro experiments.
Discussion
Because lapacho has been used by South Americans since
old times for its improvement effects against cancer and
pain caused by diseases, researchers have focused on

antitumor effects and related mechanisms of this plant and
its main active compounds. In particular, it has been dem-
onstrated that -lapachone shows a potent anticancer effect
against colon cancer.25,34 However, the antimetastatic
effects of -lapachone have not been widely studied. Only a
few studies have revealed that -lapachone inhibits the
migratory ability of HepG2 and Hep3B human hepatocarci-
noma cells and reduces the spleen-to-liver tumor burden in
a metastatic pancreatic cancer mouse model by inducing the
NQO1-mediated apoptosis.32,33 In this study, we clarified
that -lapachone inhibits the colorectal lung metastasis by
inducing apoptosis and reducing metastatic phenotypes
such as EMT, migration, and invasion.
Cancer is a complex disease involving changes in mul-
tiple pathways and microenvironments. In particular, can-
cer cells that avoid cell death and continue to proliferate
uncontrollably help in cancer progression. Apoptosis is a
programmed cell death that occurs naturally in cells and can
be beneficial for cancer therapy.35 Therefore, anticancer
effects of natural products and compounds caused by induc-
tion of apoptosis have been extensively studied.24 According
to recent studies, -lapachone can induce apoptosis in
human leukemia HL-60 cells and human prostate cancer
cells.31 It can also promote the cell cycle arrest and caspase-
mediated apoptosis in human colon cancer cell lines, includ-
ing HCT-116, SW480, and SW620.34,36 In this study, the
antiproliferative effects of -lapachone were investigated in
the metastatic colon cancer cell lines CT26 and MC38. We
demonstrated that -lapachone significantly inhibited the
proliferation of both cell lines (Figure 1B-D), and this anti-
proliferative effect occurred through the induction of apop-
tosis (Figure 2).
Apoptosis occurs via 2 main pathways, extrinsic and
intrinsic. The extrinsic pathway is a death receptor-
dependent pathway, with death ligands involved or extra-
cellular stimulations initiated through specific death recep-
tors. In this pathway, caspase-8 is activated by binding of
death ligands to the receptors, which subsequently activates

caspase-3 and PARP.37 The intrinsic pathway, which is a
mitochondria-dependent pathway, is activated by several
signals, including DNA damage and loss of cell survival
factors due to various types of cell stress. This pathway is
maintained by balancing the activity of pro- and anti-apop-
totic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Among the Bcl-2 family
members, the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL suppress Bax, which promotes apoptosis by release
of cytochrome c, a pro-apoptotic protein. The release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria activates caspase-9
and subsequently activates caspase-3.38 In the present study,
-lapachone induced the apoptosis of CT26 cells through
the cleavage of caspases-3, -8, -9, and PARP. Moreover, the
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are anti-apoptotic
proteins, decreased, while that of the pro-apoptotic protein
Bax increased after treatment with -lapachone (Figure 2B
and C). These results suggest that -lapachone shows a
strong apoptosis induction effect through inhibition of both
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in CT26 cells.
Control of cell cycle progression is considered an effec-
tive strategy for tumor treatment. It has been reported that
-lapachone induces cell cycle arrest in diverse cancer
cells.31 Our data showed that -lapachone (1 µM) treatment
for 24 hours induced G0/G1 phase arrest of cell cycle pro-
gression in CT26 cells (Figure 3), which indicates that the
cell cycle arrest is one of the mechanisms of inhibition of
CT26 cell proliferation. However, human colon cancer cells
SW480, SW620, and DLD1 were arrested at different
stages of the S phase by -lapachone (5 µM) treatment for 4
hours.36 In other studies, it was shown that -lapachone
induces the S-phase blockage in human hepatoma cells
(HepA2), and G0/G1 phase arrest in leukemia, prostate, and
breast cancer cells.31,39 Additionally, it was found that low
concentrations of another phytochemical berberine induce
G0/G1 arrest, while higher concentrations induce G2/M
arrest in prostate cancer cells.40 Therefore, these studies
indicate that the mechanisms of -lapachone-mediated cell
cycle arrest is modulated by external conditions such as the
treatment concentration or time.
Metastasis has been found to be accompanied by vari-
ous physiological alterations, which contribute to the deg-
radation of ECM, as well as invasion and migration of
tumor cells via the blood stream or lymphatic system. This
also includes subsequent transport of tumor cells to other
Figure 5. -Lapachone reduces migration and invasion ability. (A) Wound healing assay. CT26 cells were cultured to 80% confluence
in a 6-well plate, and the cell layer was scratched with a 200 µL micropipette tip. After washing with a serum-free medium, the cells
were treated for 24 hours with the indicated concentrations of -lapachone. After the incubation, images were photographed using a
microscope (100× magnification). (B) Invasion assay. CT26 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in a 24-well plate with a matrigel-
coated transwell chamber. After 24 hours of incubation with -lapachone, the inner side of the chamber was fixed and stained.
Photographs are representative of 3 independent experiments. (C) MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in -lapachone-treated CT26 cells
were determined by gelatin zymography. (D and E) mRNA expression levels of the cell invasion­related factors MMP-2, -9 (D) and
TIMP-2, -1 (E) were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR after -lapachone (10 or 100 nM) treatment for 24 hours. Results are expressed as
the mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments. *P < .05 and **P < .01.

tissues and organs.8 Because the EMT process contributes
to a more stromal cellular adhesion profile, increased
tumor cell motility, and invasive properties, this process is
important for metastasis. The classical cadherins (E- and
N-cadherin) are transmembrane adhesion glycoproteins
linked to the actin cytoskeleton by different types of catenin
molecules.19 The mobility and invasive ability of cancer
cells increase with reduction in E-cadherin expression,
which is a cell-cell adhesion molecule, and increase in the
N-cadherin expression, which is inversely associated with
the expression of E-cadherin. EMT regulators, including
the transcriptional repressor Snail and transcriptional tar-
gets such as vimentin and -catenin, are also associated
with this response.41 Our results showed that -lapachone
at noncytotoxic concentrations increased the expression of
the epithelial marker E-cadherin and decreased the
expressions of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin,
vimentin, -catenin, and Snail (Figure 4).
Characteristic changes associated with EMT enable the
migration and invasion of cancer cells.15 Deregulated cell-
cell or cell-matrix adhesion and increased cell migration are
preconditions for the progression of metastatic cancer.42
MMPs have a crucial role in the cancer cell migration and
invasion.43,44 In particular, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are known
to degrade the ECM in a process associated with cancer
progression, invasion, and metastasis, whereas their inhibi-
tors TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 regulate these activities. Thus,
many studies have focused on the levels of MMPs and
TIMPs which are involved in the metastasis process.45
Based on these observations, we investigated the effects of
-lapachone on the invasive ability of CT26 cells. We con-
firmed that -lapachone could decrease the migratory and

invasive ability by inhibiting the activities and expression
of MMP-2 and MMP-9, while increasing the expression of
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in CT26 cells (Figure 5).
-Lapachone induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
various cancer cells, and several mechanisms have been
reported for the anti-proliferative effects of
-lapachone.46-49 -Lapachone, known as an NADPH qui-
none oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) regulator, triggered
necroptosis through the NQO1-dependent, reactive oxy-
gen species­mediated receptor-interacting protein kinase
1­PARP1­apoptosis-inducing factor pathway in human
hepatic adenocarcinoma SK-Hep1 cells.46 Additionally,
inactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal-
ing pathway was found to be related to -lapachone-
induced apoptosis and growth inhibition of human gastric
carcinoma AGS cells.47 Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a
constitutive transcription factor involved in the regulation
of apoptosis in cancer cells.48,49 -Lapachone modulated
the transactivation of Sp1 and induced apoptosis through
regulation of apoptosis- and cell cycle­related proteins in
non­small cell lung cancer and melanoma cells. Therefore,
further studies are needed to elucidate other mechanisms
for the antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects of
-lapachone on CRC cells.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated for the first time that the antimeta-
static effect of -lapachone against the metastatic colon
cancer cell line CT26 in vitro and in vivo. -Lapachone
inhibited the lung metastasis of colon cancer cells by induc-
ing apoptosis and suppressing metastatic phenotypes such
as EMT, migration, and invasion. These results suggest that
-lapachone may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for
colorectal lung metastasis treatment. Further studies on
-lapachone are necessary to investigate its antimetastatic
effects and mechanisms in various cancer cell lines and
clinical cases.
