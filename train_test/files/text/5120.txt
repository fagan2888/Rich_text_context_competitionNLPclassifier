Abstract
Objective: To investigate levels of chemokine (C­X­C motif) receptor 4 (cxcr4) mRNA and
protein in X-irradiated glioma cells.
Methods: Murine malignant glioma GL261 cells transfected with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a
miRNA or control miRNA were irradiated with X-radiation. Cxcr4 mRNA and protein were
analysed using real-time reverse transcription­polymerase chain reaction and Western blot,
respectively.
Results: Levels of cxcr4 protein in GL261 cells increased in a radiation dose-dependent manner
48 h after 0, 5, 10 and 15 Gy X-irradiation. Irradiation of both HIF-1a knockdown cells and control
cells resulted in a significant increase in cxcr4 mRNA levels, compared with nonirradiated cells, at
24 h after 5 Gy X-irradiation.
Conclusion: Irradiation enhances expression of cxcr4 in glioma cells via a HIF-1a-independent
pathway.

Introduction
The main features of glioma are aggressive
invasion and diffuse infiltration of tumour
cells into surrounding brain tissue.1
Traditional radiotherapy involves the use
of large radiation fields to ensure treatment
of these diffusely invasive glioma cells, but

clinical research has demonstrated that
glioma tends to recur within the irradiated
field.2 Radioresistance is therefore an
important issue in glioma treatment. In
glioma, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) is upregulated by irradiation and
promotes the motility of the glioma cell
in vitro,3 indicating that cytokines secreted
by irradiated tumour cells play a role in
radioresistance.
Stromal cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a)
is the only known ligand for chemokine
(C­X­C motif) receptor 4 (cxcr4). In glioma
cells, the SDF-1a promoter is activated 24 h
after exposure to 8 Gy radiation,4 and cxcr4
is a key determinant of glioma progression.5
Irradiation induces tumour satellite forma-
tion by enhancing the glioma tropism of
haematopoietic progenitor cells to the
tumour bulk, an effect mediated by SDF-
1a.4 The role of tumour cells in SDF-1a/
cxcr4-mediated radiotherapy resistance is
unclear, however.
Hypoxia stimulates CXCR4 production
by the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF)-1a in glioma cells,6 and SDF-1a has
been shown to be co-localized with HIF-1a
in glioma cells that surround areas of necro-
sis.6 The aim of the present study was to use
micro RNA (miRNA) knockdown targeting
HIF-1a to investigate the role of SDF-1a/
cxcr4 signalling in radiosensitivity, in a
murine malignant glioma cell line.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The murine malignant glioma cell line
GL261 (transfected with HIF-1a miRNA
or control miRNA) was provided by the
Brain Science Research Institute of
Shandong University, Shandong, China.
Cells were cultured at 37C in a humidiEed
5% carbon dioxide atmosphere in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin.
Irradiation
Exponentially growing cells were irradiated
at room temperature with an X-ray dose
energy of 6 MV at a dose rate of 3.0 Gy/min
(VarianÕ 2300 Linear Accelerator, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). Irradiation was delivered
as a single dose of 5, 10 or 15 Gy on a 2-cm
solid water (bolus), with a source-to-surface
distance of 100 cm. Cxcr4 mRNA and pro-
tein were analysed at 24 h and 48 h after
irradiation, respectively. Experiments were
performed in triplicate.
Real-time RT­PCR
The GL261 cells (5 Â 106 cells/ml) were lysed
with TRIzolÕ reagent (Invitrogen), follow-
ing the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
was treated with DNase and purified with
the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Purified RNA was eluted in
30 ml of RNA storage solution (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) and stored at ­80C.
Total RNA was quantified by UV spectros-
copy (U3000 Spectrophotometer, Hitachi,
Japan) and cDNA synthesis was conducted
using the high-capacity cDNA archive kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Levels of cxcr4 mRNA were analysed via
quantitative real-time reverse transcription­
polymerase chain reaction (qRT­PCR)
using an ABI Prism 7500HT Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
Primers were: cxcr4, forward 50-
TCCAACAAGGAACCCTGCTTC-30 and
reverse 50-TTGCCGACTATGCCAGTCA
AG-30; Gapdh (internal control), forward
50-ATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTG-30
and reverse 50-CATACCAGGAAATGAG
CTTG-30. Reactions were conducted in a
total volume of 20 ml (1 ml cDNA, 10 ml
Zhou et al. 927
SYBRGreenÕ real-time PCR master mix
[Roche, Mannheim, Germany] and 0.6 ml
of each primer). Cycling conditions included
a prevention of carry-over contamination
(2 min, 50C) and a hot start (10 min, 95C),
followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 10 s and
60C for 45 s. For analysis, a threshold was
set for the change in fluorescence at a point
in the linear PCR amplification phase. Melt
curve analysis was performed to ensure a
single product species. All experiments were
performed in triplicate for both target gene
and internal control, and were repeated
three times, independently.
Western blotting
Whole-cell extracts were prepared using lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM sodium
chloride, 1% TritonÕ X-100, 0.01% SDS,
1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0] and protease inhibitor
cocktail tablets [Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN, USA]). Total protein
(30 mg/lane) was separated by 12% SDS­
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). After
blocking in 5% nonfat skim milk in TBST
(Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride
with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room tem-
perature, membranes were incubated with
rabbit antimouse cxcr4 antibody (1 : 1000
dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
rabbit antimouse gapdh antibody (1 : 1000
dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4C. After
washing three times with TBST, membranes
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin G
(1 : 5000 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies) for 1 h at 37C, then
washed three times with TBST. Proteins
were visualized using an ECL Plus kit
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed
by chemiluminescent detection using a Fuji
LAS 3000 (FujiFilm Medical Systems,
Stamford, CT, USA) system.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD and
between-group comparisons were made
using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
In malignant glioma cell line GL261, levels
of cxcr4 protein at 48 h after irradiation
were visibly increased in a radiation dose-
dependent manner (Figure 1).
Data regarding cxcr4 mRNA levels in
GL261 control cells and HIF-1a knock-
down cells at 24 h after 5 Gy irradiation are
shown in Figure 2. Irradiation of both cell
types resulted in a significant increase in
cxcr4 mRNA levels compared with nonirra-
diated cells (P < 0.05 for both comparisons).
Discussion
Findings of the present study indicate that
irradiation enhances the expression of cxcr4
in murine glioma cells in vitro. It has been
shown that irradiation enhances the invasive
potential of glioma cells via activation of the
Rho signalling pathway,7 as well as enhan-
cing VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) -2 secretion.8,9 In addition, glioma

cell mobility was enhanced by
adding irradiated-conditioned medium to
nonirradiated cells.3 We hypothesize that
the enhanced invasive ability of irradiated
glioma cells is mediated both directly via
glioma cells themselves and indirectly via the
increased expression of various mediators.
Hypoxia-inducible factor IF-1a is a key
factor in hypoxia-induced CXCR4 produc-
tion.5 The CXCR4 receptor was found to be
co-localized with HIF-1a in glioma cells
surrounding areas of necrosis, suggesting a
correlation with HIF-1a.6 Hypoxia pro-
motes expansion and inhibits the differenti-
ation of human glioma-derived cancer stem
cells through activation of HIF-1a.10 The
present study focused on the role of HIF-1a
in irradiation-induced cxcr4 production.
Silencing of HIF-1a by RNA interference
attenuates glioma cell growth in vivo.11
Low-dose irradiation was found to activate
endothelial cell migration directly via SDF-
1a, independent of HIF-1a induction.12
Irradiation-stimulated upregulation of
cxcr4 in glioma cells was not inhibited by
HIF-1a knockdown in the present study,
suggesting that HIF-1a is not the key medi-
ator of irradiation induced SDF-1a/CXCR4
signalling.
Our present study found that irradiation
induced cxcr4 expression. The SDF-1a/
CXCR4 and VEGF/VEGFR pathways syn-
ergistically induce tumour neoangiogenesis
and metastasis,13 and interrupting this
synergistic axis would be a more efficient
antiangiogenesis strategy than inhibiting
VEGF alone. Preclinical studies have indi-
cated that the therapeutic effect of

anti-VEGF treatment combined with irradi-
ation is transitory, and is followed by rapid
regrowth and increased tumour aggressive-
ness.3,14 Clinical studies of patients with
rectal cancer found that monotherapy with
the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab upre-
gulates SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression in
tumour cells, and higher SDF-1a plasma
levels during bevacizumab treatment were
significantly associated with distant metas-
tasis.15 Simultaneous inhibition of both
VEGF and SDF-1a/CXCR4 might enhance
the efficacy of radiotherapy. New targets for
controlling the invasiveness of irradiation-
treated glioma cells are required, thereby
facilitating a new strategy in the fight against
radioresistance.
