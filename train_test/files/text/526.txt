ABSTRACT
Objective To assess differences in the use of electronic
medical records (EMRs) among medical specialties and
practice settings.
Methods A cross-sectional retrospective study using
nationally representative data from the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the period
2003­2010 was performed. Bivariate and multivariate
analyzes compared EMR use among physicians of 14
specialties and assessed variation by practice setting.
Differences in EMR use by geographic region, patient
characteristics, and physician office settings were also
assessed.
Results Bivariate and multivariate analysis
demonstrated increased EMR use from 2003 to 2010,
with 16% reporting at least partial use in 2003, rising
to 52% in 2010 (p<0.001). Cardiologists, orthopedic
surgeons, urologists, and family/general practitioners
had higher frequencies of EMR use whereas psychiatrists,
ophthalmologists, and dermatologists had the lowest
EMR use. Employed physicians had higher EMR uptake
than physicians who owned their practice (48% vs 31%,
p<0.001). EMR uptake was lower among solo
practitioners (23%) than non-solo practitioners (42%,
p<0.001). Practices owned by Health Maintenance
Organizations had higher frequencies of EMR use (83%)
than practices owned by physicians, community health
centers, or academic centers (all <45%, p<0.001).
Patient demographics did not affect EMR use (p>0.05).
Conclusions Uptake of EMR is increasing, although it
is significantly slower in dermatology, ophthalmology,
and psychiatry. Solo practitioners and owners of a
practice have low frequencies of EMR use compared with
non-solo practitioners and those who do not own their
practice. Despite incentives for EMR adoption, physicians
should carefully weigh which, if any, EMR to adopt in
their practices.
INTRODUCTION
Electronic medical records (EMRs) have been
touted as a way to reduce medical errors, consoli-
date medical records, reduce costs, and increase
coordination and quality of patient care.1­4
Although there is no federal requirement for physi-
cians to use EMRs, the federal government has
incentivized the use of EMRs by subsidizing physi-
cians and hospitals for adopting `meaningful use' of
certified EMRs in their practice.5 Meaningful use
has been defined to mean that certified EMR pro-
grams should result in healthcare that emphasizes
prevention, efficiency, evidence-based medicine,
and is patient-centered, with more specific criteria
to be implemented in stages.6 The American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009
delineates three main components of meaningful
use: (1) EMR must be used in a meaningful way,
such as for prescriptions; (2) EMR must involve
exchanging health information electronically to
improve healthcare quality; (3) EMR technology
must be used for submitting clinical measures and
quality.7 8
Under the ARRA, the federal government has
allocated $17 billion in incentives for purchase and
adoption of EMRs. These incentives include up to
$18 000 in extra Medicare payments during the
first year of implementation if done in 2011 or
2012, which can total $44 000 over 5 years.7 9
Reimbursement will be less if physicians implement
EMRs after 2012. Furthermore, physicians who do
not demonstrate meaningful use of certified elec-
tronic health records will receive deductions from
their reimbursement for services provided to
Medicare and Medicaid patients effective from
2015. The deductions begin at 1% in 2015,
increase to 2% in 2016, and become 3% in 2017.9
Although implementation of EMRs among physi-
cians is increasing, the rate of adoption has, until
recently, been relatively slow, especially among
small and independent practices.10­12 Commonly
cited barriers to establishing EMRs in the office
setting include initial costs and costs of mainten-
ance, concern over slowing of the physician's pace
and workflow, uncertainty over which of the many
EMR products and software is most user-friendly,
and concerns over technical support and whether a
given EMR program will become obsolete.13 14
The purpose of this study was to assess the
trends in EMR implementation among the various
medical specialties and office settings practicing
within ambulatory medicine in the USA. By dem-
onstrating which specialties and office settings
have had slower rates of adoption to date, the
study seeks to identify targets for future incentive
programs.
METHODS
We used data from the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) to assess the use of
EMRs from 2003 to 2010. The NAMCS has col-
lected data from 1973 to 1981, in 1985, and annu-
ally since 1989 from non-federal employed
physicians about outpatient visits in the USA. The
NAMCS uses a multistage probability design to
obtain its data. The first stage consists of obtaining
samples from 112 primary sampling units (PSU)
out of the roughly 1900 such units into which the
50 states and District of Columbia is divided. The
second stage involves obtaining a sample of prac-
ticing physicians from each PSU. The final stage

consists of random samples of office visits from the practices of
sample physicians. These sample physicians were divided into
52 subsamples of physicians, each of which was randomly
assigned a different 7-day reporting period. During these report-
ing periods, a random systematic sample of visits was selected.
Data are recorded by the physician or staff regarding the reason
for the visit, symptoms, diagnoses, medications prescribed and/
or provided, and demographics of patients and the services pro-
vided. Visits to hospitalists, anesthesiologists, pathologists, and
radiologists are excluded from the NAMCS data. In the final
report, the number of survey responses by physician specialty
were adjusted according to the proportion of total physicians
that each specialty represents.15 16
We analysed data from 2003 to 2010 to determine the pro-
portion of physician visits with partial and full use of EMRs.
The year 2003 was chosen because a previous study using
NAMCS data had demonstrated no change in EMR use from
2001 to 2003.17 We assessed the use of EMRs among the 14
medical specialties classified by the NAMCS. The NAMCS uses
the system of specialty classification defined by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a separate system from
those used by the American Board of Medical Specialties or
American Medical Association.15 Full and/or partial use of
EMRs is presented as a separate survey question from use of
EMRs for billing. The NAMCS survey allowed physicians to
state they had full use, partial use, no use, or were unsure
whether they had use of EMRs.
We also assessed the influence of patient characteristics on
EMR use. The NAMCS allows physicians to record patient
characteristics such as age, gender, and race for each visit. We
divided age into 10-year increments (0­9, 10­19, 20­29, etc).
Race was divided into Caucasian, African-American, and other,
which is consistent with the categories used by the NAMCS.
Further, we explored physician practice characteristics on
EMR use. The NAMCS asked physicians, `Is this a solo prac-
tice?' for which we divided the answers into `Yes' and `No'. We
further analyzed the data to determine the proportion of solo
practices by specialty, as we hypothesized that, if there was a sig-
nificant difference in EMR use among specialties, the specialties
with lower frequencies of EMR use may have a higher propor-
tion of solo practitioners. Our reasoning was that, if the cost of
EMR was a barrier for implementation, solo practitioners may
face larger barriers without other group members to share in
the costs.
Type of office setting for each visit was assessed by physician
responses to `Type of Office Setting for this Visit'. Responses
were divided into private practice, Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO), and others (community health center,
mental health center, non-federal government clinic, and family
planning clinic). Employment status of the physician was also
assessed, dividing the responses into owner of the practice or
non-owner.
We further analyzed differences in EMR use by geography.
The categories for geography included North, South, Midwest,
and West based on the NAMCS methodology for grouping the
geographic regions of the ambulatory visits.
Bivariate analysis was performed using software to conduct
linear regression and 2 testing (SAS/STAT software, SAS
Institute). For multivariate analysis, a logistic regression was per-
formed to explore the use of EMR among physician specialties,
adjusting for physician specialty, year, practice ownership status,
office type, and geographic region (STATAV
.11.0, Stata, College
Station, Texas, USA). The logistic regression was weighted using
the NAMCS sampling and weighting scheme. For the purposes
of logistic regression, `partial' and `full' EMR use were com-
bined as using EMR. The office setting variable was categorized
as HMO, private or group practice, and other. The study was
declared exempt by the Wake Forest University Institutional
Review Board.
RESULTS
Bivariate analysis
From 2003 to 2010 the NAMCS sampled 228 965 physician
office visits, which estimate the experience of 6.73 billion total
ambulatory visits. Primary care physicians (obstetrics and gyne-
cology, family and general practice, pediatrics, and internal medi-
cine) accounted for 102 965 responses (45.0%), while surveys
from specialists represented 126 000 responses (55.0%). Across all
specialties combined, the reported full and partial use of EMRs
increased from 2003 to 2010 (figure 1). The surveys in 2003 and
2004 did not differentiate between full and partial use of EMRs.
During those 2 years, use of EMR (whether full use or partial use)
increased. The full use of EMRs in 2010 among all specialties was
39%, which represents a 3% increase from the previous year and a
127% increase from 2005. At least partial use of EMRs in 2010
was 52%, which was 3% higher than in 2009 and 100% higher
than in 2005. EMR use was highest among urologists, general and
family physicians, oncologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic sur-
geons and was lowest among psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, and
dermatologists (figure 2).
Increases over the period from 2003 to 2010 varied from
74.1% in otolaryngology to 397.2% in urology (table 1). The
specialties with the lowest frequencies of use still saw large
increases over time: 294.2% in psychiatry, 229.2% in dermatol-
ogy, and 131.3% in ophthalmology.
Physicians' employment status was another factor in EMR
use. Use of at least partial EMR among physicians who were
employed (48%) was higher than EMR use among physicians
who owned their practice (48% vs 31%; p<0.001). EMR use
was also dependent on whether or not a physician was in solo
practice, with EMR use among solo practitioners of 23% com-
pared with 42% among those not in solo practice (p<0.001).
The specialties with higher proportions of solo practitioners had
lower frequencies of EMR use than specialties with lower pro-
portions of solo practitioners (figure 3).

There were also different frequencies of at least partial EMR
use according to practice ownership (figure 4). Physician or
physician group ownership was associated with 32% EMR use
while HMO ownership of the practice demonstrated an EMR
use of 83%, community health center ownership was associated
with EMR use of 42%, and medical/academic health center
ownership with 40% (all p<0.001). There was no provision in
the NAMCS survey that allowed physicians to state the number
of physicians in their group.
Physician office visits in the West were more likely to be asso-
ciated with EMR use than visits in the Northeast, Midwest, and
South (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference
in EMR use when comparing patient characteristics of race, sex,
or age (p>0.05).
Multivariate analysis
There were 192 179 sampled office visits representing over 6.5
billion total office visits included in the multivariate analysis.
This differs somewhat from the figures in the bivariate analysis
since the data from 2006 were dropped in the multivariate ana-
lysis due to collinearity. There was a significant time trend of
increasing use of EMR since 2003 (table 2). General and family
practice had the highest frequencies of EMR use and, while
other specialties had similar ORs of EMR use, these were not
statistically significant. Compared with general and family prac-
titioners, EMR use was lowest among dermatologists, ophthal-
mologists, and psychiatrists (OR=0.52, p<0.01; OR=0.60,
p<0.01; OR=0.34, p<0.001, respectively).
Office setting was also a predictor of EMR use. Physician
practice owners were less likely to use EMR than non-owners
(OR=0.61, p<0.01), and physicians in HMOs and other

prepaid office settings were much more likely to use EMR than
physicians in private solo or group practices (OR=0.24,
p<0.001) or other practice settings (OR=0.33, p<0.001).
Geographic region was not a determinant of EMR use after
adjusting for physician specialty, office setting, ownership status,
and year (table 2).
DISCUSSION
The use of EMRs among all physicians has been rising since
2003. Financial incentives will most likely continue to increase
EMR adoption, and even the three lagging specialties had more
than doubled their EMR use since 2003. However, EMR use
among the different medical specialties varied widely between
2003 and 2010, with three specialties (ophthalmology, derma-
tology, and psychiatry) significantly lagging behind the others.
Uptake of EMR among solo practitioners has been slower
than for non-solo practitioners. The three specialties with the
lowest frequencies of EMR use were among the specialties with
highest rates of solo practitioners (figure 3). The likelihood of
EMR adoption increases with the number of physicians in a
medical group.18 One recent study demonstrated that the use of
EMRs was 17.2% in practices with 1­2 physicians, 38.2% in
practices with 3­7 physicians, and 44.8% in practices with 8­12
physicians.19 With the significant costs of EMR implementation
and annual maintenance, solo practitioners may find it more dif-
ficult to share the costs of EMR than those in a group practice
or those employed by larger organizations. However, gaps in
EMR use may be narrowed by the reimbursements for EMR
implementation provided by the ARRA.
A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study suggested that
office-based providers may see little benefit to adopting EMRs
because many of the administrative benefits that EMR is
designed to create can only be seen by providers who are part
of an integrated healthcare delivery system. In fact, the CBO
further suggests that office-based providers may in fact lose
money from EMRs.20 Another paper with a wide literature
review concluded that there were insufficient data to make cost-
effectiveness conclusions regarding EMR adoption.1 Others
have demonstrated possible, but modest, financial benefits.13
The relatively small incentives available are perhaps insufficient
to motivate physicians in some settings to adopt EMRs.
Another possible contributing factor to varying frequencies of
EMR use among different specialties is that, until recently, many
of the EMR software programs tended to be `one-size-fits-all'
with features and tabs that may be valuable for some specialties
but not others.21 Recently, however, software companies have
developed more specific EMR software programs for individual
specialties. It is unclear what effect, if any, these targeted EMR
software programs will have on EMR implementation rates in
the near future within these specialties. However, a recent study
showed that, as of 2011, intention to apply for EMR meaning-
ful use incentives still varied widely among specialties, from
15% in psychiatry to 82% in cardiovascular disease.22 The
adoption of EMRs in psychiatry may be hampered by strict reg-
ulations governing privacy and security of behavioral health

records. System integration, such as image management solu-
tions for ophthalmology and dermatology, appears to be
another specialty-specific obstacle. Thus, skepticism about the
benefits of EMRs seems to persist in the slower-adopting spe-
cialties despite new features and incentives.
One limitation of this study is that the NAMCS has
up-to-date publicly available data through 2010, which cannot
examine the full effects of the federal government's incentives
toward EMR adoption, much of which started to occur in late
2009. These incentives will probably continue the increased use
of EMRs; recent NCHS studies estimate that the overall fre-
quency rose to 57% in 2011 and 72% in 2012.23 24 This study
also did not examine year-by-year trends within each specialty,
allowing for the possibility that a specialty has more recently
made significant strides toward EMR uptake that may not be
reflected by a significantly lower overall frequency of EMR use
from 2003 to 2010. In addition, physician age was not pro-
vided, so the NAMCS does not permit assessment of gener-
ational differences in EMR adoption patterns. The general
question asked in the survey about full or partial EMR use
does not show whether use is sufficient to meet meaningful use
criteria.
EMRs have the potential to enhance organization, lower costs
in some settings, and reduce errors. However, industry experts
contend that the EMR software market lacks a clear leader or
standard bearer because EMR design and usability is still devel-
oping.25 While universal EMR implementation ultimately seems
inevitable, adopting EMRs simply for the sake of adoption may
prove to be detrimental, as evidenced by a 2001 study which
illustrated physician disenchantment and significant time and
autonomy concerns after 6 months' use of EMR.26 Other
studies since that time have suggested wider acceptance and sat-
isfaction with EMRs. However, although EMR software has a
high probability of improving care and workflow, its adoption
cannot in and of itself guarantee what it has been touted to
do.27 28 Although the theoretical benefits of EMRs are convin-
cing, two recent studies demonstrated that EMRs have not yet
significantly improved quality of care.29 30
CONCLUSIONS
For physicians who are looking to implement EMRs, there are
many potentially positive reasons for doing so: better coordination
of patient care, organization of patient files, improvement in pro-
viding preventative services, reduction of redundant laboratory
tests, and drug interaction warnings--to name a few. With federal
incentives through 2014, much of the cost of EMRs can be offset
by demonstrating meaningful use of EMRs. However, EMRs are
clearly continuing to evolve, and will undoubtedly improve as phy-
sicians provide more feedback and market forces support the soft-
ware that demonstrates ease of use and better patient care. This
study suggests that there are significant discrepancies in EMR use
among specialties and physician office characteristics which
provide an opportunity for both physicians and EMR developers
to address, and for government to design appropriate incentives.
For now, physicians should carefully weigh whether the impact of
EMRs on patient care and reimbursement for EMR adoption
justify entering `uncharted' territory.
