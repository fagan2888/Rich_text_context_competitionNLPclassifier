Abstract
Our objective was to examine the association between ethnicity and birthplace and the percent of energy from selected
food groups among Hispanics, the largest growing segment of the US population. We used data from NHANES 1999­
2004, collected from Mexican (n ¼ 3375) and other Hispanic (n ¼ 622) adults (18 y and older), classified as foreign born (FB)
or US born (USB). Using University of North Carolina's food-grouping system, we created 24 nutrient- and behavioral-
based food groups. We examined percent consuming and per-consumer estimates using logistic and linear regression
models, respectively. Predicted mean energy was estimated using marginal effect models. All models were controlled for
gender, age, income, and education and were weighted to account for sampling design. FB Hispanics obtained more
energy from food groups such as legumes, fruits, and low-fat/high-fiber breads, with differences accounted for by a
greater percent consuming these foods rather than higher energy intake among consumers. Conversely, FB Hispanics
consumed a lower percentage of energy from foods such as non-Mexican fast food and snacks and desserts. Speaking
Spanish also was associated with greater consumption of legumes, rice, fruits, soups, and potatoes. Variation in diet may
in part account for the difference in nutrition-related adverse health outcomes observed among USB Hispanics, particularly
Mexicans. Targeted dietary interventions are needed to reduce health disparities associated with dietary intake. J. Nutr.

Introduction
The United States Latino population, of whom ,60% are of
Mexican origin, is the largest growing segment of the population
with a growth rate almost 4 times that of the total population
(1). This increase is partly a function of high fertility levels
among this subpopulation but is also due to migration (2); an
estimated 37% of the total foreign-born (FB)5 population living
in the US was born in Mexico or Central America (3). This has
led to extensive research on the role of acculturation and
immigrant status on health.
Researchers have often concluded that living in the US
adversely affects the health of Hispanics (4­8). Under the
concept of the Hispanic paradox, which refers to the tendency
for Hispanics to enjoy relatively good health despite socioeco-
nomic disadvantages (9), it is frequently noted that Hispanics
tend to have healthier diets prior to arriving in the US.
Furthermore, it has been observed that the longer Hispanics
are in the US, the worse their diets become (8). Such shifts in
health-related behaviors are associated with the higher rates of
obesity and diabetes among US Hispanics (10) and among those
who have lived here for $15 y (11). The hypothesis is that
through exposure to the US environment and lifestyle, there is
adoption of the dominant culture's behaviors and norms,
including greater consumption of away-from-home foods (par-
ticularly fast food) for both lunch and dinner.
In the absence of more rigorous studies of the acculturation
process (e.g. national longitudinal studies), researchers have
attempted to develop a consensus on the most meaningful
operationalization of this process. Language spoken at home
and length of time residing in the US are 2 such operationali-
zations (5,6,8,12­14). More recently, researchers have begun
examining the influence of country of origin, which may be
particularly important given the diversity of countries repre-
sented by Hispanics in the US. Although Mexicans are the
largest Hispanic group in the US, estimated at 28.4 million in
2006, there is considerable heterogeneity among Hispanic
subgroups (15), including differences in histories of immigra-
tion to the US, age, socioeconomic status, and location of
residence in the US. For example, Mexican-Americans tend
to be younger, less educated, and have lower incomes than
Cuban-Americans (16).

However, surprisingly few studies have explored dietary
differences among Hispanic subpopulations, especially between
the most dominant groups, Mexican/Mexican-Americans and
other Hispanic subgroups. Additionally, little is known about
whether potential differences are modified by birthplace or
degree of acculturation. Separating Mexican from other His-
panic subgroups is particularly important because adult resi-
dents of Mexico now have obesity levels similar to US residents
(71% of Mexican women and 66% of Mexican men were
overweight or obese in 2006), whereas rates of overweight and
obesity are lower in Cuba, Dominican Republic, and all other
Central and South American populations (17­19).
This study seeks to understand this gap by using nationally
representative data to: 1) examine differences in the percent of
energy from specific food and beverage groups by ethnicity; 2)
determine whether birthplace modifies the relationship between
ethnicity and dietary intake; and 3) examine the relationship
between degree of acculturation (defined as language spoken in
the home) and percent of energy from selected food groups.
Methods
Participants and data source. This study uses secondary data collected
from adults $18 y from 4 consecutive NHANES (1999­2004). These
samples contained stratified area probability samples of noninstitution-
alized US households. Each survey year was designed to be nationally
representative. Detailed information about each survey and its sampling
design have been published previously (20­23). From the full NHANES
sample, we selected a subgroup of individuals identifying themselves as
Mexican/Mexican-American (n ¼ 3375) or other Hispanic (n ¼ 622).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Dietary intake and food groups. Dietary intake information was
collected by 24-h dietary recall, which was administered in person by
trained interviewers. Respondents reported all foods and beverages
consumed in the previous 24-h time period, including names of foods,
times consumed, type of meal or snack, and location of food consump-
tion. Instructions and interviews were completed in either English or
Spanish. Collection of dietary information was aided by a 4-step
automated coding and collection system (Computer Assisted Dietary
Interview System, 1999­2001) or the USDA's automated multiple pass
method (2002­2004), a 5-step computerized dietary recall instrument
used for data collection (21). Although the 4- and 5-step automated
systems are very similar, they do introduce a source of methodological
variation. However, it is unlikely that differences in the dietary recall
methodology would result in differential dietary recalls by ethnicity [i.e.
that foreign born (FB) other Hispanics would respond differently than
FB Mexicans] and are therefore not expected to differentially affect
our results. Because only a single 24-h recall was available for years
1999­2001, we chose to exclude the additional 24-h recalls available
in 2002­2004 for the purpose of maintaining consistency within our
dataset.
We used a modified University of North Carolina food-grouping
system (24) to group all reported foods and beverages into 57 food
groups based on nutrient (i.e. fat and fiber content) and behavioral
consumption (i.e. snacking) characteristics. Beverage groups are in
accordance with the recently suggested Beverage Guidance System (25).
Based on this and previous work (26,27), it was determined that many of
these food groupings did not facilitate differentiation of dietary intake
between ethnic subgroups and thus it was most convenient to create
groups comprised of combinations of foods. For example, it was more
appropriate to use a combined vegetable group instead of individual
green and orange vegetables, low-fiber vegetables, medium-fiber vege-
tables, and high-fiber vegetables groups. Similarly, given space limita-
tions, it was not possible to present differences for all 57 food groups.
Results are presented for foods/food groups that represented at least 2%
of total energy intake for at least 1 subgroup [FB or US-born (USB)
Mexican or other Hispanic] or for which there was at least a 1%
difference between 2 groups (i.e. Mexican FB consumed 2.4% more
energy from legumes and soybeans than USB Mexicans).
Our final analyses were conducted on 57 variables, 24 of which are
presented here, representing the proportion of energy from each food/
beverage group. Examples of the food groups used include: legumes and
soybeans (e.g. lentils, pinto, black, soy, and garbanzo beans), low-fat/
high-fiber breads (e.g. tortillas, whole-wheat breads, and bread prod-
ucts), fruits (citrus and noncitrus, fresh and dried), vegetables (e.g. lima
beans, corn, squash, and tomatoes) snacks and desserts (e.g. cookies,
pastries, ice cream sandwiches, crackers, chips, and popcorn), and non-
Mexican fast food (e.g. pizza, French fries, hamburgers, and Chinese
from fast food restaurants). Additionally, we examined several beverage
variables, including low- (1.5% or skim) and high-fat milk (2% or higher
and buttermilk), soda and fruit drinks (fruit drinks that are not 100%
juice), and fruit and vegetable juice (only 100% juice). Potatoes were
grouped separately from all other vegetables and French fries were also
grouped independently but later combined with other fast food items
(due to negligible differences in consumption) into the non-Mexican fast
food group. More detailed descriptions and sample foods for each of the
24 food groups presented in the article can be found in the Online
Supplemental Material.
Acculturation variables and additional covariates. All demographic
and socioeconomic variables were collected using a combination of in-
person and in-home interviews. For the 2 ethnic subgroups, Mexican and
other Hispanic, we examined degree of acculturation, which was defined
using 2 unique variables: birthplace (USB vs. FB) and language spoken in
the home (primarily Spanish speaker, yes/no). Location of mother and
father's place of birth (US, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, Dominican
Republic,othercountry)wasexaminedfordescriptivestatistics.Covariates
used in analyses include gender, age (continuous), total family income
(,$20,000 vs. $$20,000), and education (highest grade completed).
Statistical analyses. All analyses were completed in Stata 10.0 (Stata
Corp) using weighted survey commands to account for study design and
sampling methods. Sampling methods have been described in detail
elsewhere (23,28,29). Briefly, data are collected using a complex,
multistage probability sampling designed to select participants that are
representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Indi-
viduals are selected from households, which are selected from segments,
which are selected from counties across the US. Oversampling of certain
subgroups is done to increase the reliability and precision of estimates
of health status indicators for those groups. Relevant to this article,
Mexican-Americans were oversampled in 1999­2004 survey years.
Demographic characteristics were summarized for all ethnic groups
and are presented as means and or percentages 6 SEM. Comparisons
between ethnicity and/or birthplace were conducted using Student's
t tests for means or chi-square tests for proportions. All P-values were
2-tailed and significance was defined as P , 0.05.
To examine the relationship between acculturation and diet, we
generated a weighted mean [using 2-stage marginal effect models
(MEM)] of percent energy from each food group on ethnicity and
birthplace or being a Spanish speaker. MEM are appropriate where the
ordinary least-squares (OLS) assumption of normality is violated. For
example, nearly 43% of our sample did not consume high-fat milk, so an
OLS estimate of ethnicity/birthplace for percent of energy from high-fat
milk would be misestimated.
Using a 2-stage modeling process, MEM first estimate the probability
of consuming a given food and then, among consumers, estimate the
effect of the exposure on the amount consumed. These values are then
multiplied and the resulting estimate is a weighted mean of the effect of
the exposure on consumption amount in the full sample. There was a
significant interaction between the exposures ethnicity and birthplace
(Wald chunk test; P , 0.05), so indicator variables [Mexican FB
(referent); Mexican USB; other Hispanic FB; other Hispanic USB] were
used to model the relationship between this indicator of acculturation
and percent of energy from selected foods.
To examine the Spanish language exposure variable, a dichotomous
variable was used. A control variable ``no language information
available'' was also included to account for those who did not provide

information on their primary language used at home. We tested and did
not find a significant 3-way interaction between ethnicity, birthplace, and
being a Spanish speaker or between birthplace, income, and being a
Spanish speaker. Bootstrap estimation, using random sampling from the
dataset with replacement, was used to generate standard errors around
marginal effect estimates. All models controlled for gender, age, family
income, and education.
Logistic regression models were used to estimate the percent of each
ethnic group [Mexican USB, other Hispanic USB, and other Hispanic FB
vs. Mexican FB (referent)] that consumed food and beverage groups.
Finally, we estimated the amount eaten among consumers (persons who
actually reported consuming a food or food group) by ethnicity and
birthplace (USB vs. FB) using OLS regression. To ease interpretation,
we transformed the estimated percent of energy from each food group
into absolute predicted mean kilocalories. For example, if 9% of an
ethnicity's 2200 daily kcal6 (9211 kJ) were obtained from soda and fruit
drink, we present 198 predicted mean kcal/d (829 kJ/d) from soda.
Likewise, if consumers of the legumes and soybeans food group obtained
10% of their 2200 total energy from this food group, we reported 220
predicted kcal/(consumerÁd) [921 kJ/(consumerÁd)]. Similar to other
studies, all models controlled for gender, age, family income, and
education (5,11). Differences in percent of energy from food groups were
tested using t tests and are considered significant at the P , 0.05 level.
Results
FB other Hispanics were slightly older, whereas FB Mexicans
were slightly younger than their USB counterparts (P , 0.05)
(Table 1). Regardless of ethnicity, a larger proportion of FB
Mexicans (68.9 6 1.6%) and FB other Hispanics (42.8 6 0.3%)
had less than a high school education compared with USB
Mexicans (31.8 6 2.3%). Among FB other Hispanics, Cuba and
``Other Country'' represented the top 2 paternal and maternal
place of birth categories. Nearly 97% of FB Mexicans had
parents who also were born in Mexico. Spanish as the primary
language spoken in the home was most prevalent among FB
other Hispanics (38.5 6 10.0%) and least prevalent among USB
other Hispanics (1.9 6 1.0%; P , 0.05) (Table 1).
Differences in consumption between USB and FB Mexicans
and other Hispanics. Being born in the United States, compared
with elsewhere, was associated with greater total energy intake
and a lower percent of energy from food groups such as fruits and
vegetables (Table 2). For example, USB consumed a lower percent
of kcal from legumes and soybeans, fruit, high-fat milk, and
vegetables than FB Mexicans (P , 0.05).
These translated into considerable differences in absolute
predicted mean kcal/d. For example, FB Mexicans consumed
nearly twice as much energy from legumes and soybeans as USB
Mexicans (P , 0.001), 32 more kcal (134 kJ) from fruits (P ,
0.01), and 20 more kcal (84 kJ) from vegetables (P , 0.001). FB
Mexicans also consumed more energy from low-fat/high-fiber
breads than USB Mexicans (P , 0.001) (Table 3).
Generally, differences in predicted mean kcal/d are the result
of differences in the percent consuming rather than per-
consumer kcal estimates [predicted kcal/(consumerÁd)] (Table
3). For example, 19% more FB (40.0 6 0.3%) than USB (20.9 6
0.3%) Mexicans consumed legumes and soybeans (predicted

more kcal/(consumerÁd) [155 kJ kcal/(consumerÁd); P , 0.001].
Similar trends in the percent consuming and predicted kcal/
(consumerÁd) were observed for fruits, vegetables, and low-fat/
high-fiber breads (Table 3). In fact, nearly 23% more FB
Hispanics reported consuming fruits compared with their USB
counterparts. Only in the case of vegetables was the difference in
the percent consuming relatively small between FB (77.5 6
0.3%) and USB Mexicans (72.1 6 0.2%; P , 0.001).
In both age- and gender-adjusted (Table 2) and fully adjusted
predicted means (Table 3), USB other Hispanics consumed
significantly less energy from fruits than FB other Hispanics, and
nonsignificantly less energy from legumes and soybeans, and low-
fat/high-fiberbread (amongothers, Table3). For eachofthese food
groups,significantly fewer USB thanFBother Hispanicsconsumed
from these food groups, although the percentage was most striking
for fruit; 48.1 6 0.6% FB other Hispanics compared with just
25.6 6 0.8% USB other Hispanics (Table 3). Unlike FB Mexicans,
FB other Hispanics ultimately consumed less energy from legumes
and soybeans than USB other Hispanics.
Greater consumption of unhealthy foods by USB than FB.
For many foods groups, USB Mexicans and other Hispanics
tended to consume greater predicted mean kcal compared with
their FB counterparts, with the most significant differences
observed for Mexicans. Consider, for example, non-Mexican

fast food. Adjusted for age and gender, USB Mexicans obtained a
greater (P , 0.001) percentage of energy from this food group
(Table 2), amounting to a difference of 56 mean kcal/d (234 kJ/d)
(Table 3). Significant differences in the predicted mean kcal/d
were also observed for soda and fruit drinks (P , 0.001), snacks
and desserts (P , 0.001), and candy and sugars (P , 0.001)
(Table 3, predicted mean kcal/d).
Differences in the predicted mean kcal/d estimates between
USB and FB were largely accounted for by differences in the
percent of consumers rather than differences in the amount eaten
by consumers (Table 3). For example, 34.5 6 0.5% of USB
Mexicans compared with 23.7 6 0.4% of FB Mexicans reported
consuming non-Mexican fast food (P , 0.001), whereas
consumers in each group obtained 23 6 0.5% of their daily
energy from this group (data not shown), the equivalent of 515 6
1 kcal/(consumerÁd) for FB and 529 6 2 kcal/(consumerÁd) USB
Mexicans (Table 3). Given the differences in the overall energy
intake of these 2 groups [2311 6 38 kcal (9676 6 159 kJ) vs.
2248 6 32 (9412 6 134 kJ) kcal for USB and FB Mexicans,
respectively], this amounted to a difference of just 14 kcal (59
kJ) (P , 0.001; Table 2). Similarly, for snacks and desserts and
candy and sugars, more USB (12%) compared with FB (9%)
Mexicans consumed these foods, accounting for between 30
(126 kJ) and 40 (167 kJ) additional kcal/(consumerÁd) (P ,
0.001 for each food group; Table 3).
Patterns were slightly different for other Hispanics. Although
significantly more USB other Hispanics reported consuming
non-Mexican fast food (114 6 0.1%; P , 0.001), consumers
obtained 5.3% less energy (data not shown) than FB consumers,
which translated into 68 fewer kcal/(consumerÁd) [285 kJ/
(consumerÁd)] for USB other Hispanics (Table 3). For candy and
sugars, although there were 8% fewer USB consumers, they
obtained roughly 74 more kcal/(consumerÁd) [310 kJ/(consum-
erÁd)] compared with FB other Hispanics (Table 3).
Small but significant percent of energy from beverages.
Although beverages accounted for a smaller proportion of
overall energy intake, there were significant differences between
ethnic groups and birthplace. USB Mexicans and other His-
panics consumed less energy from high-fat milk and fruit and
vegetable juices compared with their FB counterparts, although
differences were significant only for Mexicans (high-fat milk and

fruit and vegetable juice; P , 0.001). Compared with FB
Mexicans, significantly fewer USB Mexicans consumed high-fat
milk, but the percentage of energy among consumers was
relatively equal (data not shown) and amounted to roughly
equivalent predicted kcal/consumer (Table 3).
Low-fat milk consumption differed for other Hispanics. USB
consumers obtained 13.6 6 0.6% of their daily energy from
low-fat milk, compared with just 6.0 6 0.4% among FB, which
is the equivalent to 184 6 0.88 fewer kcal/(consumerÁd) (770 6
3.68 kJ) from low-fat milk for FB other Hispanics.
Similarly, although the predicted mean kcal from soda and
fruit drinks did not differ between FB and USB Mexicans (data
not shown), USB Mexicans obtain 34 6 0.07 more daily kcal/d
(142 6 0.29 kJ/d) compared with FB Mexicans (Table 3). The
difference between USB and FB other Hispanics is even greater
[1100 6 0.3 kcal/d (419 6 0.13 kJ/d) than for USB compared
with FB other Hispanics (Table 3)].
Spanish and non-Spanish speakers maintain different
dietary patterns. As an alternative to birthplace/generation
status as an indicator of acculturation, we examined the effect of
being a primarily Spanish speaker (compared with a non-
Spanish speaker) on dietary intake using MEM controlling for
age, gender, family income, and education (Fig. 1). As was the
case for birthplace/generation status, Spanish speakers tended to
consume foods commonly observed among the less acculturated
(8). Significant differences in the percentage of total energy were
observed for legumes and soybeans (P , 0.01), pasta, rice and
ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals (P , 0.01), soups (P , 0.05),
potatoes (P , 0.05), and fruits (P , 0.01).
Discussion
The objective of this study was to examine how ethnicity and
acculturation were associated with dietary intake in Hispanic
adults living throughout the United States. Specifically, we
sought to compare percent of daily energy intake between
Mexicans and other Hispanics who were either USB or FB to
determine whether birthplace was differentially related to diet
within ethnic groups. We found that acculturation, having been
born in the US, was associated with a lower percentage of energy
from arguably ``healthier'' food groups, specifically legumes,
fruits, and vegetables. At the same time, more acculturated
Hispanics seem to consume a greater percent of energy from less
healthy foods such as snacks and fast foods. These foods are also
those that tend to be associated with increased risk of non-
communicable diseases (30­34).
Generally, the greatest differences were observed between FB
and USB Mexicans, supporting the hypothesis that accultura-
tion, and not just modernization, might account for differences
in diet. Similar results to ours have been reported previously
among adults (35), but discrepant findings have been reported
among adolescents (5) and may reflect underlying differences in
dietary patterns of older compared with younger Mexicans. The
lack of significant differences between USB and FB other
Hispanics might be due more to the relative heterogeneity of
ethnicities represented by this group rather than an actual lack of
differences between those born in the US or elsewhere. We were
not able to more specifically characterize other Hispanics due to
sampling design and the small sample sizes.
Dietarypatternshighinfruits,vegetables,andfiberaretypically
considered ``healthier'' (36,37) and these consumption patterns
tend to be associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist
circumference (38) and a reduced risk of other chronic diseases
(39,40) compared with other dietary patterns. Our findings,
combined with the results from other studies in the same
population (41), suggest that USB Hispanics, and Mexicans in
particular, might be at increased risk for nutrition-related chronic
disease.
Specific health-related consequences of the shifts toward a
more nontraditional dietary pattern have been observed in both
children and adults. A study of Latino families in San Diego
County, CA, found that BMI was positively correlated with
frequency of fast food consumption in children and consump-
tion at an ``American'' restaurant in their parents (42). The
degree of acculturation also has been shown to be highly
associated with increased risk for obesity. The adjusted odds
ratio [95% CI] for obesity in men was 1.43 [1.11, 1.84] and 1.38
[1.19, 1.67] in women. The effect was even stronger for those
who were more highly acculturated (defined using 4 measures of
linguistic preference) and persons who had lived in the US for the
longest time had the highest BMI (11). Physical activity also is
likely to play an important role in weight gain and the develop-
ment of obesity among children and adults (43,44) who are more
acculturated, due primarily to changes in occupational- and
transportation-related physical activity (7).
There are several limitations to our study. First, our charac-
terization of ethnicity did not permit us to examine subgroups of
other Hispanics (i.e. Dominican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.)
accurately and the sample size was too small to examine them
separately. It is possible that there is considerable heterogeneity
among these groups that we could not account for in these
analyses. Related to this point, due to missing data, we were
unable to accurately classify generational status (beyond 2nd
generation, due to missing data on parents' place of birth) or
to assess the level of acculturation using the currently recom-
mended multidimensional, bidirectional approach (14). Again,
important differences in these groups might exist and warrant
further study.
Despite these limitations, the present study has several
strengths that allow us to fill important gaps in the literature on
the topic of acculturation and diet. Specifically related to the use

of NHANES data, we had a strong, nationally representative
sample of Mexican-American adults living in the US, comprehen-
sive dietary intake measures, and a validated computer-assisted
data collection method that increased the accuracy of dietary
intake reports. A notable methodological advantage of this study
was our use of modeling strategies that allowed us to account for
nonconsumers when estimating the effect of ethnicity and
birthplace on diet. This is a standard method used in economics,
but rarely do nutrition scholars consider this issue, which can bias
results (45,46). The marginal effect approach employed in this
study has 2 distinct advantages. First, it accounts for the
simultaneity of the probability of consuming a food and the effect
of consuming in the function that is being estimated. Second, it
does not impose a restriction on the distribution of individual
characteristics or the distribution of food intake. This is essential
to obtaining unbiased, accurate estimates. Finally, the use of
bootstrapping allows for the computation of more precise
measures of standard error around these estimates.
Considering the well-established link between diet and disease,
and the increased risk of adverse health outcomes observed in
more acculturated Hispanics, this work has important implica-
tions for the development of culturally and generationally targeted
nutrition interventions. For example, improving access through
neighborhood interventions might prove a useful strategy for
supporting maintenance or increased consumption of foods that
have consistently been found to decrease with the acculturation
process (8).
In a recent study of primarily first-generation Latino women,
most reported shopping at supermarkets and grocery stores that
catered to Mexican clientele with respect to store design and
items offered (47). Additionally, women in this study who
indicated a preference for fast food vs. other restaurants
identified distance to the restaurant as one of the most influential
factors in determining restaurant choice (47). In a separate
immigrant community, low-fat milk represented just a fraction
of available milk options in smaller grocery stores and super-
markets (48), but consumption increased significantly in this
community when access to low-fat milk increased in school
cafeterias (49). Altering access could have potentially positive
impacts on healthfulness of the diet.
We report that FB and USB Mexicans and other Hispanics
consume foods differently both with respect to percent consum-
ing certain food groups and the amounts consumed among
consumers. These findings suggest that Hispanic subgroups have
important differences in dietary behaviors that might be
obscured if they are studied as a single ethnic group. There are
likely important interactions between the process of accultura-
tion and the environment in which this process occurs. Future
studies should examine Hispanic subgroups individually and
seek to identify additional characteristics, beyond birthplace,
which might provide further insight into the differences in health
behaviors and health outcomes.
