Abstract
In this paper, we reflect on the disciplinary contours of contemporary sociology, and social science more generally, in the
age of `big and broad' social data. Our aim is to suggest how sociology and social sciences may respond to the challenges
and opportunities presented by this `data deluge' in ways that are innovative yet sensitive to the social and ethical life of
data and methods. We begin by reviewing relevant contemporary methodological debates and consider how they relate
to the emergence of big and broad social data as a product, reflexive artefact and organizational feature of emerging
global digital society. We then explore the challenges and opportunities afforded to social science through the wide-
spread adoption of a new generation of distributed, digital technologies and the gathering momentum of the open data
movement, grounding our observations in the work of the Collaborative Online Social Media ObServatory (COSMOS)
project. In conclusion, we argue that these challenges and opportunities motivate a renewed interest in the programme
for a `public sociology', characterized by the co-production of social scientific knowledge involving a broad range of
actors and publics.

Introduction
In this paper, we report on the work of the
Collaborative Online Social Media ObServatory
(COSMOS) project1 as an evolving response to a
number of fundamental methodological and disciplin-
ary challenges for social science at the beginning of the
21st century. We explore the challenges presented to
sociology and the social sciences in general as a conse-
quence of the rise of commercial transactional data and
the opportunities afforded by big and broad, publically
available social media data for sociological and social
scientific enquiry in the digital age. A key organizing
principle here is the idea of collaborative observation.
We frame these opportunities and challenges within the
context of calls for a `public sociology' (see Burawoy,
2005), whose aim is to establish a dialogue with a broad
array of audiences beyond the academy and transform
sociological practice. This dialogue requires an infra-
structure for communication and collaboration to sus-
tain it. As a contribution towards this, we present
COSMOS, an open platform for social data analysis.
Building and applying COSMOS necessitates engaging
constructively with the `computational turn' in soci-
ology (also known as computational social science:
for a critique, see Boyd and Crawford, 2012).
COSMOS reflects how processes of social scientific
knowledge production are adapting to meet the

challenges and opportunities offered by new forms of
social data. Of potentially even greater significance, we
argue, is how COSMOS may contribute to the pro-
gramme for a public sociology by providing a vehicle
for the involvement of a broad array of publics in the
co-production of social scientific knowledge.
Theoretical and methodological context
It is important to couch these challenges and opportu-
nities within contemporary social thought. Many of
these have been framed within the context of global
complexity, mobilities and information flow (Urry,
2003), the rise of the networked society (Castells,
2011) and the consequential and constitutive effects of
`big and broad' social data upon social formations and
relations (Ruppert et al., 2013). These represent pro-
found questions for sociology as a viable empirical dis-
cipline that is able to speak truth to power while, at the
same time, affording opportunities for innovation and
re-invigoration in terms of theory, method, data and its
relationship to society beyond the academy. The scale,
complexity and speed of these transformations demand
an interdisciplinary response, but they also speak to
core sociological concerns that relate to classic ques-
tions of social organization, social change, and the inte-
gration and regulation of citizens within complex, late
modern, globalizing, and interconnected social forma-
tions. However, these transformations raise questions
about the capacity of academic social science to scope
and make sense of them in comparison to other agents
and institutions, where `scoping the social' through
access to `big and broad' social data can help to realize
competitive or strategic advantage for states, multi-
nationals, and other agencies in the `global race' in a
`runaway world' (Archibugi et al., 1998; Giddens,
2002). Furthermore, the theoretical consequences for
reflexive modernization (Beck, 1992), liquid modernity
(Bauman, 2000) and late modern social formation
(Giddens, 2002) require further consideration in the
light of the emerging contours of digital societies.
However, for sociology, and social science more gen-
erally, the present debate and response are centred on
empirical concerns. The reasons for this can be under-
stood to lie in the emergence of big and broad social data
as a consequence of social and economic transformation
realized through the digital revolution and rise of net-
worked societies. Digital societies are self-referential, in
the sense that they generate data as an accountable trace
and functional pre-requisite for network and system
integration. Furthermore, this data provides a powerful
means of understanding and scoping populations and
social life on a massive scale. This represents a challenge
and an opportunity for sociology that is suffused with
political, ethical and empirical issues. While all these are
salient and mutually constitutive, it is questions of data
and empirical enquiry that have brought these and
related issues into sharp focus within sociology and the
social sciences under the rubric of the `social life of meth-
ods'; Ruppert et al. (2013: 24) state:
. . . we seek to unsettle debates about how the prolifer-
ation of the digital is implicated in large-scale social
change and remaking the governance and organization
of contemporary sociality (for instance, Castells' [1996]
network society, or the notion of biopolitics . . . we are
concerned with the implications of digital devices and
data for reassembling social science methods or what
we call the social science apparatus. Here we build on
our interest in elaborating the social life of
methods . . . through a specific concern with digital
devices as increasingly the very stuff of social life in
many locations that are reworking, mediating,
mobilizing, materializing and intensifying social and
other relations.
In their account of the `coming crisis of empirical soci-
ology', Savage and Burrows (2007) argue that, in pre-
vious decades, social scientists were able to claim a
distinctive expertise in investigating social relations
through such methodological innovations as the
sample survey and the in-depth interview. Since the
advent of digital technologies, this claim has been com-
promised by the proliferation of transactional data gen-
erated, owned and increasingly analysed by large
commercial organizations, as well as government
departments. The availability to commercial enterprises
of large volumes of continuously updated data on, for
example, retail transactions, telephone communica-
tions, financial expenditure and insurance claims
makes for an uncomfortable comparison with episod-
ically generated datasets such as the census of popula-
tions,2 general household surveys, police recorded
crime, victim of crime surveys and labour market sur-
veys on which academic sociology has traditionally
relied, and provokes an existential question: is aca-
demic sociology ``becoming less of an `obligatory
point of passage' for vast swathes of powerful agents. . .
if so, how can the discipline best respond to this chal-
lenge?'' (Savage and Burrows, 2007: 886). Concerns
about the marginality of academic sociology need
revisiting in the light of the subsequent explosion of
new digital communications, such as social networking
sites, the `blogosphere' and the increasing popularity of
micro-blogging, or, named after the most renowned
micro-blogging service, `tweeting'. Significantly, these
technologies facilitate the mass communication and
sharing of `user-generated content', and have given
rise to a form of mass, self-reported data about their
users' daily routines, perceptions of, and sentiments
2 Big Data & Society
about, particular events. Twitter users, for example,
post more than 500 million tweets per day; Facebook
users post 9 million messages per hour.
Social and computational researchers have already
begun to mine and `repurpose' this naturally occurring,
socially relevant data in their `predictive' efforts.
Tumasjan et al. (2010) were able to measure Twitter
sentiment in relation to candidates in the German gen-
eral election, concluding that this source of data was as
accurate at predicting voting patterns as traditional
polls. Again, mining the `Twittersphere', Asur and
Huberman (2010) were successful in correlating the sen-
timent expressed about movies with their revenue,
claiming that this method of prediction was more
accurate than the gold standard Hollywood Stock
Market. Beyond social networks, Ginsberg et al.
(2009) successfully correlated flu-based search terms
entered into the Google search engine with visits to
the local doctor to epidemiologically trace the spread
of the disease across the USA.3 Another notable exam-
ple is the wealth of social media communications about
major incidents of civil unrest, such as the `Arab
Spring' (e.g. Howard et al., 2011; Stepanova, 2011)
and the riots in English cities during August 2011
(Procter et al., 2013a, 2013b). These studies illustrate
the potential significance of social media technologies
for facilitating the harvesting and analysis of `naturally
occurring' mediated data as contrasted with findings
from experiments, surveys and in-depth interviews,
which are necessarily the artefacts of social research
methods (Cicourel, 1964). However, this proliferation
of `lively' social data poses a significant set of chal-
lenges that are still being confronted. Savage (2013: 4)
states:
My argument is that the `Social Life of Methods' arises
as part of a dual movement. These are, firstly, an
increasing inter-disciplinary interest in making methods
an object of study . . . I explore how this current poses a
topical challenge to dominant instrumentalist readings
of methods, which currently predominate in social sci-
ence research. The second aspect of this interest is,
however, less commented on, but in my view equally
important. This is the crisis, increasingly evident in the
`research methods community' regarding positivist
forms of knowledge, as forms of standardized data
exceed the capacity of standard quantitative procedures
to process and analyse them. The proliferation of
`lively' data has created an emergent space in which
there is a dramatic potential to rethink our theoretical
and methodological repertoires.
As academic researchers grapple with the methodo-
logical challenges posed by the growth of big and
broad social data, it is important to acknowledge that
these will not be resolved through internal dialogue
alone. Big and broad social data raise significant ethical
issues that demand an open debate with citizens about
the role and status of academic research and the
relationship between the academy and wider society.
In his invitation for a `public sociology', former
President of the American Sociological Association
Michael Burawoy identified the different ways in
which social research is produced for and communi-
cated to various publics, specifically students, policy-
makers and the broader citizenry (Burawoy, 2005).
For Burawoy, a truly public sociology is one that sus-
tains, nurtures and defends civil society against state
and market pressures. However, in their paper on the
`coming crisis of empirical sociology', Savage and
Burrows (2007) argue that the capacity of social
research to realize such a public role is compromised
by the emergence of big and broad social data streams
generated by ­ and largely exclusive to ­ commercial
transactional data. A consequence of this, in their view,
is that commercial and private interests now have the
capacity to envisage, indeed constitute, populations in
powerful ways that are insulated from open and demo-
cratic scrutiny.
As we will argue, when set against the growth of
openly available data from social media platforms
and the momentum of the open data movement,4
these threats to the legitimacy of academic social sci-
ence may not be as grave as they seem. In our view,
these developments provide an opportunity to forge a
new relationship with society beyond the academy,
which, if researchers are willing to seize it, may help
to reinvigorate the programme for a public sociology.
Big and broad social data
The term `big and broad' social data serves to draw
attention to three salient dimensions that define new
forms of social data: volume, variety and velocity, the
latter reflecting its often real-time and rapidly changing
character. The term has become one of the key phrases
for describing the data deluge and the rise of digital
infrastructure and device innovations that not only
shape and constitute new forms of practice but also
configure data streams in ways that reconfigure and
constitute social relations and populations (Ruppert
et al., 2013). Big Data is being generated in multiple
and interconnecting disciplinary domains that include
genetics, environmental science and astronomy, as well
as within the social domain, where data is being pro-
duced through a myriad of transactions and inter-
actions through multiple media and digital networks.
Technological innovation in digital communications,
epitomized in the shift from the informational web
(Web 1.0) to the interactional web (Web 2.0), provokes
Housley et al. 3
new opportunities and challenges for social research.
Web 2.0 technologies, particularly the new social
media platforms (e.g. social networking, blogging and
micro-blogging), as well as the increased accessibility of
the Web through portable and ubiquitous devices like
smartphones, tablets and net books generate new forms
of data which are of significance for social research, as
well as stimulating the development of new methods
and techniques for analysis. At the same time, the
increasing adoption of open data principles by large
public bodies in the UK and elsewhere is giving
researchers fresh opportunities to interrogate new digi-
tal data streams to answer social science questions.
Large national and multinational corporations have
recognized the power of Big Data to help them spot
business trends; they have developed infrastructure
and strategies to collect a wide range of data, and con-
cerns have grown that traditional social science
research methods would not be able to compete. It is
feared that big business and other organizations with
deep pockets can use the data they gather to group
people together into populations that are new and
powerful, but are inaccessible to public social science
or, indeed, to any meaningful public scrutiny. This has
led to the so-called `empirical crisis' identified above.
However, the rise of digital innovations characterized
by interaction, participation and the `social' provides
an opportunity to explore ways in which this asymmet-
rical relationship with data and analytic capacity might
be confronted. In particular, they offer the prospect of
new ways of engaging with diverse publics, such as `citi-
zen social science' where members of the public can
assist with research through crowdsourced coding and
registration of their beliefs and opinions at volume in
relation to key sociological concerns (see Procter et al.,
2013c). We see these developments as affording a way
forward for confronting the empirical crisis within the
social sciences through exploiting these new forms of
open data and for developing an additional resource for
a public sociology that has citizen participation at its
core. Realizing this transformation entails the develop-
ment of a participatory infrastructure of digital `obser-
vatories' and `collaboratories'. To this end, we present
the COSMOS project as a potential exemplar and early
prototype.
Challenges, opportunities and digitally
re-mastering the classic questions
In contrast to the pessimism of the Savage and Burrows
thesis, we see opportunities as well as the challenges
presented to social science by innovations in digital
technologies. Broadly defined, the evolving field of
`digital social research'5 has begun to recognize the
value of big and broad social data. The COSMOS
project forms a part of this evolving research field
and is itself the product of intensive inter-disciplinary
collaboration between the social scientists and com-
puter scientists co-authoring this paper. The computa-
tional engineering involved in the COSMOS project is
discussed in further detail below. In this section, our
focus is upon the social scientific relevance of digital
technologies and the kind of data they produce. In
brief, we want to argue that far from undermining the
social scientific programme pursued in the latter half of
the 20th century and epitomized in C. Wright Mills'
(1959) vision of the sociological imagination, these
technologies and their allied data have the potential
to `digitally re-master' classic questions about social
organization, social change and the derivation of iden-
tity from collective life.
Now that people have enthusiastically adopted
social networking platforms right across society, and
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are
routinely used to access information and to interact
with friends and with strangers alike, new forms of
data are being created that are highly significant for
social research. Even though we are in the midst of
this rapid innovation, it is nonetheless possible to dis-
tinguish three basic lines of argument about its current
and prospective impact (Edwards et al., 2013). Some
commentators suggest that this innovation generates
methods and data that can act as a surrogate for
more traditional quantitative and qualitative research
designs such as experiments, sample surveys and in-
depth interviews. Others argue that digital communica-
tion technologies re-orientate social research around
new objects, populations and techniques of analysis
such as parenting skills or medical self-diagnosis. It
can also be argued that digital social research augments,
but needs to be used in conjunction with more trad-
itional methods. C. Wright Mills' identification of
three classic questions that underpin the sociological
imagination are useful for clarifying the distinctive con-
tribution of digital social research: what can it do that
traditional methods cannot in understanding how
social organization and relations are constituted, how
do these change over time and how do they generate
social identities? It is argued that digital social research,
particularly in the context of the analysis of new social
media, is distinctive in capturing naturally occurring or
`user-generated' data at the level of populations in real
or near-real-time. Consequently, it offers the hitherto
unrealizable possibility of studying social processes as
they unfold at the level of populations as contrasted
with their official construction through the use of `con-
ventional' research instruments and curated datasets
(see Table 1 for a summary).
An exemplar of this is the possibility of augmenting
traditional methods of psephology by registering voting
4 Big Data & Society
sentiments expressed through micro-blogging or trad-
itional methods of urban political analysis by investi-
gating the role of social media in shifting local policy
agendas (e.g. Bonso
´ n et al., 2012; Lide
´ n and Nygren,
2013). In these two examples, new social media can be
seen to have the potential both to re-organize and
change social relations, while leaving a digital footprint
that can be collected, analysed and visualized. The pace
at which this footprint is accumulating and the recur-
sive qualities of social media also have the potential to
re-orient social research. An early example of this was
the role of social media in propagating rumours about
riotous activity in English cities in August 2011 and in
dispelling them (Procter et al., 2011, 2013a). There are
also examples of the role of social media in propagating
not only hateful sentiments but also counter-speech,
which challenges bigotry and other misinformation.
An instance of this is the recent micro-blogging reaction
to a UK television documentary (`Benefits Street'),
which followed the lives of welfare benefits claimants
living on a street in the city of Birmingham in the
English Midlands. The Twitter timeline for #benefits-
street demonstrates the pace at which misunderstanding
about the numbers and characteristics of benefits claim-
ants can be challenged both by individual micro-blog-
gers and by those representing campaigning groups and
trade unions.
As indicated in Table 1, the distinctive contribution
of big and broad social data such as social media, as
both a subject and means of social research, can be
clarified through reference to concepts of research strat-
egy and design in the philosophy of social science (e.g.
Edwards et al., 2013; Sayer, 1992). In this literature, the
distinction between intensive and extensive research is
used to differentiate research strategies that are con-
cerned with investigating how processes work in a par-
ticular case from those concerned with identifying the
`regularities, common patterns and distinguishing fea-
tures of a population' of cases (Sayer, 1992: 243).
Another useful distinction is between research designs
that seek to capture the locomotion of social life, the
idea that social relations always have to be accom-
plished and are therefore subject to reformation if not
transformation, and those that seek to puncture this
process at certain points in order to capture a `snap-
shot' of how social relations are configured at any one
moment. The former designs imply research that can
support the continuous observation of social life,
which, prior to the advent of big and broad social
data, necessitated forms of qualitative inquiry and
ethnographic immersion in the social process in ques-
tion and this limited observation to the study of `indi-
vidual agents in their causal contexts' (Sayer, 1992:
243). By contrast, the distinctive quality of big and
broad social data for research is the possibilities it pro-
vides for the continuous (`real-time') observation of
populations hitherto only accessible through episodic
and retrospective snapshots gleaned through such
instruments as household surveys and census data, lon-
gitudinal studies of cohorts and experiments measuring
pre-test and post-test conditions. In these terms, the
distinctiveness of big and broad social data is the pos-
sibility of extensive research into the locomotion of
social life, such as the unfolding of election campaigns,
the shaping of policy agendas in local government, the
prevalence of suicidal ideation, the propagation of big-
oted and prejudicial opinions and the `sensing' of crime.
As emphasized elsewhere (Edwards et al., 2013), how-
ever, the real transformative power of big and broad
social data is in its use to augment and re-orientate
rather than replace the other more established research
strategies and designs depicted in Table 1.
The COSMOS project as a response
The COSMOS project represents an attempt to forge
interdisciplinary working between social, computing
and computational scientists as a means of realizing
the theoretical, methodological, empirical and public
objectives identified above. A genuine conversation
and orientation towards interdisciplinarity is key to
responding to the challenges of big and broad social

data and the emerging architecture of digital societies.
In a recent article, Tinati et al. (2013: 175) state:
Unless sociologists are prepared (and able) to acquire
sophisticated computational expertise, we must collab-
orate with computer scientists . . . to develop multidis-
ciplinary curricula and research that transcend the
usual disciplinary boundaries. We have experienced
first-hand the challenges arising from the different epis-
temologies, histories and languages of sociology and
computer science, which raise questions about the
wider politics of knowledge and dynamics of power
and identity that arise in multidisciplinary work.
Practices associated with collaborative working and
teamwork are important for realizing interdisciplinary
work of this sort. While not a focus of this paper, the
role of interdisciplinary work in networked and distrib-
uted teams and citizen research is worthy of future scru-
tiny and consideration (Dutton and Jeffreys, 2010).
Furthermore, it is important to note that the co-pro-
duction of digital tools has to sit side by side with the-
oretical and methodological concerns. To this extent
the COSMOS platform is merely one expression of a
wider programme of research within a collaborative
observatory framework where other `offline' research
methods are also of importance ­ not least in relation
to the ongoing refinement of algorithms via expert and
lay input through a process of `collaborative algorithm
design' (Edwards et al., 2013: 256­257). For the remain-
der of this paper we will focus on the features of the
COSMOS platform and consider how it links to a
public sociology agenda and the challenges and oppor-
tunities outlined earlier.
The COSMOS platform
The COSMOS platform provides an integrated suite of
computational tools for harvesting, archiving, analys-
ing and visualizing social media data streams using
publicly accessible application programming interfaces
(APIs). In this paper, we focus on Twitter data as it
arguably provides the most open and voluminous social
media data source and has thus become established as a
key data source for public opinion and behaviour
mining. Twitter data has been used to measure public
mood (Bollen et al., 2009), opinion (Pak and Paroubek,
2010; Thelwall et al., 2011), tension and cohesion
(Burnap et al., 2013a; Williams et al., 2013) and to
explore communication patterns (Bruns and Stieglitz,
2012).
The COSMOS platform currently provides nine
modes of analysis, some of which operate at the indi-
vidual tweet level and others at a corpus level (i.e. tweet
collections). These can be applied individually or in
combination to enable the exploration of, and `drilling
down' into, datasets as a precursor to more detailed
interrogation.
Individual tweet level
. Gender identification is used to derive the portrayed
gender of the person who posted the tweet (the
tweeter).
. Language detection is used to determine the lan-
guage used in the text of the tweet.
. Sentiment analysis is a form of opinion mining that
attempts to derive a score (positive or negative) to
measure the polarity and strength of mood expressed
in a tweet (Thelwall et al., 2011).
. Tension detection was developed specifically for
COSMOS. It implements a conversation analytic
method ­ membership categorization analysis ­
combined with lexicons of expletive terms, tension-
specific degradation terms and attribution terms to
classify tweets on a three-point ordinal tension scale
(Burnap et al., 2013a).
. Geo-spatial location assigns a sending location to
the tweet. A small proportion of tweets (1%) cur-
rently have global positioning system (GPS) co-ordi-
nates included within their metadata. For those that
do not, this tool attempts to derive a probable loca-
tion from user profile metadata and keyword match-
ing of text referring to place.
Corpus level
. Keyword frequency analysis visualizes occurrences
of specified keywords as a bar chart over time.
This allows the researcher to identify visually
points of high and low activity in relation to an
event or topic. COSMOS visualizes frequency using
three units of time ­ by day, hour and minute ­ each
visualized on its own timeline (see Figure 1).
. Social network analysis enables visualization of the
interactional relationships between groups of
Twitter users (see Figure 4 for an example).
. Qualitative overview provides a list of the text in all
tweets. This can comprise all tweets within a specified
time range, tweets that match the parameters identi-
fied using the filters, or a combination of both. The
text of each tweet is displayed, along with two attri-
butional annotations: the gender of the tweeter and
the sentiment scores (positive and negative) calcu-
lated based on tweet content. This gives the
researcher an `at a glance' view of the filtered dataset,
which can support identifying key topics, events,
opinions and perspectives from the text.
6 Big Data & Society
For a detailed description of the COSMOS platform
and its tools, see Burnap et al. (2014a).
Linked data
The COSMOS platform was conceived from the begin-
ning as providing ways to link social media data with
other sources of social data, including key socio-demo-
graphic datasets. At the time of writing, the platform
has access to the UK Police API, which provides crime
data on a local district level for the previous month,
and is in the process of establishing access to the UK
Office for National Statistics, which holds census data
(as well as many other datasets), including, inter alia,
district-level unemployment, ethnic composition and
population size.
One way in which COSMOS supports data linking is
through geography (see Figure 2).
Summary
The COSMOS platform is currently undergoing beta
testing and additional analytical tools are in develop-
ment. Because of the inter-disciplinary make-up of the
project team and the core role played by its social sci-
entist members, development has always been driven by
an evolving understanding of how computational meth-
ods can best serve the needs of social research. The
guiding principle has been to explore ways in which
computational social science can make analysis of big
and broad social data tractable for the established
study principles of qualitative and quantitative
research, while creating the space for methodological
innovation.
Overview of current research
COSMOS is based on interdisciplinary, collaborative
working where a combination of theory, method
and data informs our empirical research. In this
section, we present four examples of current
research in order to illustrate the potential for col-
laborative observatories to generate empirically and
theoretically informed insight into the use of social
media-as-data within sociological and social scien-
tific research.
In a recent paper, Tinati et al. (2013: 2) argue that
sociologists have been slow to respond to the challenges
of big and broad social data and some of the opportu-
nities afforded by social media. They state:
. . . to date, the scope for pushing this research forward
has been methodologically limited because social scien-
tists have approached Big Data with methods that
cannot explore many of the particular qualities that
make it so appealing to use: that is, the scale, propor-
tionality, dynamism and relationality described above.
Rather, Big Data has commonly been approached with
small-scale content analysis ­ looking at small numbers
of users ­ or larger scale random or purposive samples

of tweets. Rendering Big Data manageable in this way
overrides its nature as `big' data, bypassing the scale of
the data for its availability or imposing an external
structure by sampling users or tweets according to a
priori criteria, external to the data themselves.
Furthermore, most previous social science studies are
snapshots, categorising content and user-types rather
than following the data as it emerges dynamically or
exploring the nature of the social networks that consti-
tute Twitter.
The body of work now emerging out of the
COSMOS project (Burnap et al., 2013a, 2013b,
2014b; Edwards et al., 2013; Housley et al, 2013;
Procter et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014; Sloan et al., 2013;
Williams et al., 2013) exemplifies how the concerns
raised by Tinati et al. may be addressed. This work
reports extensively on interdisciplinary collaborative
platform and tool development, methodological issues
in social media analysis, the use of social media ana-
lytics in the study of contemporary social phenomena,
and a consideration of wider methodological and the-
oretical issues for sociology and social science. Space
prevents a recapitulation of the points here. However, it
is worth reporting some observations derived from our
current projects at this point.
Social media, demographic proxies and crime
sensing
A fundamental problem for researchers is that tweets are
`data-light', i.e. they lack important demographic data,
e.g. gender, location, class and age, about their users
(Gayo-Avello, 2012; Mislove et al., 2011). Yet although
such data is not present in an explicit manner, the tools
available on the COSMOS platform enable it to be
inferred with a relatively high level of confidence
(Sloan et al., 2013). These derived metadata are auto-
matically generated and added to harvested tweets.
The London 2012 Olympics provide an example of
how demographics can aid interpretation of social
media data. Figure 3 is a sentiment graph covering
between 20:00 and 23:00 on Saturday, 4 August 2012
(taken from Burnap et al., 2013). This date is more
commonly known as `Super Saturday' as it was the
evening during which Team GB won three gold
medals. The data used to produce this graph consists
of tweets containing the hashtag #TeamGB.
Looking at the top two lines we can see that the major
peaks in positive sentiment for Mo Farah's progress in
the 10,000 m and the moment when Jessica Ennis cap-
tures the gold in the heptathlon are female dominated,
i.e. female tweeters show higher levels of positive senti-
ment than male tweeters. Observations such as this

generate new questions over how people engage with
social media and the influence of gender on content.
One current COSMOS project is using census, crime
and tweets to explore whether crime can be `sensed'
through social data via the signatures (social media)
and context (area demographics) of real world
events.6 This is an example of how linked social
media and curated data can be used to enrich statistical
models of social phenomena in ways that may be able
to account for complex temporal and spatial factors.
Understanding social media use at the local and
civic level
We are conducting an ongoing study of Twitter use in
two districts in the UK cities of Cardiff and Manchester
to compare emerging trends in the use of this social
media at the local and civic level and the extent to
which social media offers ways for the re-shaping of
citizen engagement in civil society (Procter et al.,
2014). Methodologically, our goal is to explore how
the analytical tools and capabilities of the COSMOS
platform can be applied to scope big and broad
Twitter data streams to a local or civic level and to
assess the sociological benefit of doing so in terms of
the capacity to generate some form of `scopic' socio-
logical insight. It illustrates how COSMOS supports the
combination of computational social science methods
applied to big social data (and social network analysis
in particular) with in-depth, qualitative analysis.
We are interested in looking for evidence of the
impact of early adopters and `innovation intermediaries'
Figure 3. Male/female sentiment of tweets containing #TeamGB between 20:00 and 23:00 on 4 August 2012 (Burnap et al., 2013).
Housley et al. 9
(Williams et al., 2005), that is, individuals and groups
with the skills and resources to shape the use of social
media as a tool for civic participation and how they
orientate to achieving their objectives. In the UK, for
example, third sector non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) such as MySociety (``using digital technologies
to make people powerful'') are noteworthy for their use
of Web 2.0 technologies to gather opinions of citizens
and act as advocates for local causes.
The study is based on tweets harvested from the
Twitter streaming API between 25 October 2012 and
14 January 2013 containing hashtags and accounts that
we identified through an initial snowballing exercise as
being associated with the respective communities. This
resulted in a total collection of over 100,000 tweets and
re-tweets. Applying social network analysis to this
sample enables us to identify accounts from which
tweets and re-tweets originated. In particular, we are
interested in three specific measures (see Figure 4):
1. In-degree (those accounts that were the most tar-
geted by other tweeters and re-tweets);
2. Out-degree (those accounts that posted the
most tweets and whose tweets were the most re-
tweeted);
3. Between-ness centrality (those accounts that ranked
highest in terms of receiving and posting tweets).
Using these measures and more general measures of
activity on Twitter, we identified 50 accounts for fur-
ther investigation, i.e. qualitative analysis of Twitter
postings to determine their topics and interviews to
explore the variety of strategies and tactics deployed
in their use of social media within the local civic
sphere. Each of these interviews was transcribed and
coded using the NVivo software package.
Social network analysis of the dataset reveals that
the local state was overwhelmingly represented with
the local council and police force figuring prominently
Figure 4. Visualization of the social network of Twitter communications in West Cardiff.
10 Big Data & Society
and representing key nodes in the network.
Nevertheless, it also reveals the presence of several
NGOs acting as `bridges' between local state actors
and individual citizens.
One local civil society organization explained how
they had used social media to mount a successful cam-
paign against a council scheme:
When [council xxxx] proposed introducing residents'
parking in [yyyy], we created a separate Twitter
account called ``Saveyyyy'' and garnered peoples' opin-
ions on the issue. Enabled us to effectively mobilise a
campaign to object to the scheme . . .
Another interviewee explained:
I have been doing Twitter to communicate with third
sector organizations in [xxxx], but particularly our
member organisation . . . that you mentioned, retweet-
ing information and getting the message out, shoring
up relationships. That sort of thing . . .
I guess it is more to increase the following, but we want
to represent the third sector organisations in [xxxx], so
we have got our member organisations and we are
looking at increasing our membership, so it's to
engage with our member organisations, but also hope-
fully other third sector organisations in [xxxx] who
aren't members and maybe haven't heard of us and
who will think gosh, they have got a lot of resources
or information.
So far, our study provides mixed evidence for the
proposition that social media is enabling a radical
reshaping of local civil society. Powerful local state
actors and established political groupings have been
amongst the most enthusiastic and effective early
adopters of new digital communications technologies,
but there is also evidence of local civil society organ-
izations using social media effectively to promote
their agendas.
These results are only a snapshot of social media use
as a tool for civil society promotion and the relatively
short sampling period may bias the results, which
motivates continuing research into how early adopters
are using these technologies and how this is influencing
their potential for radically re-shaping citizen engage-
ment in local civil society.
`Hate' speech and social media: Understanding
users, networks and information flows
The rapid and widespread uptake of social media plat-
forms brings both benefits and risks for civil society and
new challenges for agencies responsible for ensuring
that the boundaries of acceptable and legal behaviour
are not crossed. In this respect, the proliferation of the
so-called `hate speech' in social media is an area of
growing concern, as recent high-profile examples con-
firm.7 The most senior prosecutor in England and
Wales recently acknowledged the harm that can be
caused by hate speech on social media and explained
that ``banter, jokes and offensive comment are com-
monplace and often spontaneous'' and ``communica-
tions intended for a few may reach millions.''8 This
project is a study of the migration of hate speech to
social media platforms and focuses on understanding
the propagation of this type of antagonistic language.9
The project poses several key questions: (i) can we
identify hateful and antagonistic social media content,
as well as attempts to counter it, in terms of key
events, linguistic characteristics, sentiment and ten-
sion? (ii) Can we profile hateful and antagonistic
social media networks in relation to user behaviour
and interaction, building on the previous question to
develop a typology of users? (iii) Can we triangulate
the above analysis with other forms of open data,
such as the new Google Trends10 metrics to validate
the propagation of hateful content into online envir-
onments beyond social networks? (iv) Can we utilize
the data derived from the above questions to build
probabilistic models to forecast the emergence and
evolution of information flows within social media
networks through which hate-related content is trans-
mitted? And (v) can the model and methodology
inform the social scientific interpretation of how hate-
ful content travels and is impeded online, drawing on
social scientific concepts such as responsibilization
(Garland, 2001) and nodal governance (Shearing
and Wood, 2007) as framing devices?
To date we have generated hate speech corpora
covering content that is considered homophobic,
racist, sexist and disablist. These datasets are being
examined using various statistical modelling tech-
niques to identify enablers and inhibitors to hate
speech propagation (Burnap et al., 2014b). The sig-
nificant covariates of propagation can be used by
regulatory authorities to potentially stem the spread
of hate speech in the social media eco-system. Our
most recent results have shown that racial tension on
Twitter can propagate around major sporting events
and can be identified using bespoke tools such as the
COSMOS tension engine that is usable by law
enforcement to help inform operational decisions
(Williams et al., 2013).
Citizen social science
We are committed to developing ways in which the
COSMOS platform can be used to facilitate public par-
ticipation in social science. One approach we are
Housley et al. 11
currently exploring is `citizen social science', where
members of the public can assist with research, and
record their beliefs and opinions at volume (Procter
et al., 2013c).
Our interest in encouraging citizen social science has
the very pragmatic goal of securing scalable human
effort for the analysis of large social media datasets,
as projects such as Galaxy Zoo11 have already demon-
strated for the physical sciences. However, we argue
this may be a potentially significant step towards realiz-
ing the programme for a public sociology. It seems to
us that an important principle for motivating volunteer
effort is offering meaningful engagement with the
research. At a minimum this might involve providing
volunteers with access to the results made possible by
their efforts. More ambitiously, we see citizen social
science as providing a basis for forging a new relation-
ship between the social science academy and society.
Huge potential exists to harness the power of crowd-
sourcing for the study of society and human behav-
iors . . . but it's just not happening as well as it
could . . . it seems odd that social science researchers
appear to have been comparatively slow to investigate
the potential of crowdsourcing . . . social research could
be enhanced by the involvement of the public ­ from
helping to set research agendas, contributing to and
helping to analyse data sets, to formalising findings
and conclusions. Social science issues are human
issues, after all ­ they are about how we relate to
each other and organise our society and economy ­
so there seems to be a natural fit with crowdsourcing
that's largely being overlooked. This raises some obvi-
ous and legitimate concerns ­ from representation to
research ethics and integrity ­ but none of these seem
insurmountable. Indeed, social scientists would surely
benefit from greater public engagement with their
work. The prize is surely quicker, cheaper and more
imaginative research ­ the findings from which could
benefit us all. (Harris, 2012)
Our aim over the long term is to develop the COSMOS
platform as a `collaboratory', an element of a partici-
patory research infrastructure supporting public
engagement in a range of activities that includes the
exchange of ideas, debates about the shape of institu-
tions, current social problems, opportunities and
events, as well as the co-production of social scientific
knowledge through citizen social science, where publics
act as vital sensors and interpreters of social life.
However, any emerging citizen social science will also
have to take account of other relational elements and
configurations that include social class, race, gender,
sexual orientation and geography, in addition to con-
stellations of expertise and broader common sense
understanding. The synthesis of crowdsourcing tech-
niques with a sociologically informed citizen social sci-
ence remains public sociological work in progress.
Concluding remarks
Developments linked to the emergence of big and broad
social data are happening rapidly, and we cannot be
certain what impact it will have on research processes.
It is possible that it will promote the use of computa-
tional social science methods in place of more trad-
itional quantitative and qualitative research methods.
It may also influence thinking and re-orientate social
research around new objects, populations and tech-
niques. However, we think it is most desirable that
new methods be used in conjunction with the existing
ones, to make research richer and more nuanced, and
we have attempted to motivate this synthesis through
examples of our current research summarized above.
The analysis of social processes as they actually
happen is bound to give researchers insights and inter-
esting avenues to explore that are absent from the offi-
cial construction of events that is available via
traditional research instruments and curated datasets.
The COSMOS platform has been developed to help
academic researchers embrace this opportunity.
This is not without its challenges, however. An initial
hypothesis of ours was that the high volume and vel-
ocity of social media communications, as a form of big
social data that is user-generated, would enable us to
better access or `sense' civil society without the inter-
locution of administrative or professional categories.
However, as our discussion of initial findings suggests,
administrative and professional organizations have
been amongst the most enthusiastic early adopters of
social media communications and thus the next phase
of social media analysis will need more refined methods
for differentiating between the kinds of actor generating
this `Big Data', including, of course, the impact of `bot-
nets'. An obvious example of this is the use of botnets
to re-tweet and propagate campaigning materials
during elections. As a consequence, this next phase
will also have to develop methods for understanding
the recursive qualities of social media communication
and whether it is possible to disambiguate types of
human and non-human actor in social media commu-
nications and, in turn, the consequences of their inter-
action for shaping social relations, such as the outcome
of election campaigns. COSMOS has made a start on
this kind of analysis through its interrogation of infor-
mation flows and what they tell us about the patterns of
human interventions in Big Data, such as the authori-
tative rebuttal of rumour, prejudice and bigotry.
Returning to our earlier distinction between the qua-
lities of social media as both a means for, and subject
12 Big Data & Society
of, social science, it is possible to identify a number of
challenges for augmenting and re-orienting social
research through use of the Big Data generated by
social media. First, with respect to augmentation,
there is a need to reconstitute the `Big Data' generated
by social media into units of analysis that enable it to be
linked to datasets held by administrative, professional
and commercial organizations. As discussed above,
COSMOS has made some headway in this by examin-
ing how the sensing of crime through social media can
be meaningfully contrasted with police-recorded crime
rates. The granularity of insights into the pattern of
social relations that can be gleaned through linking
Big Data with other sources of data also needs to
address the wealth of administrative and curated data-
sets held by local authorities, not just those stored in
national archives. As we noted earlier, here the increas-
ing adoption of open data principles by public bodies
gives grounds for optimism.
Second, with respect to re-orientation, there is the
issue of access to social media data, and here the out-
look is less clear. Although free, open access to social
media datasets is subject to constraints, as companies
seek to monetize their data assets, it is nevertheless cur-
rently possible for academics to harvest significant and
useful volumes of data at no cost. This present arrange-
ment is not sustainable for three reasons, however.
First, it does not meet the needs of all researchers: inev-
itably, some research will require more data than is
available without cost and charges imposed by social
data resellers12 that are often too expensive for most
academic researchers. While it has been possible for
some researchers to negotiate individual deals with
social media companies, this solution is unsatisfactory
for obvious reasons: it does not scale and benefits the
few at the expense of the majority. Second, it leaves
researchers at the mercy of data providers' terms and
conditions, which may change at any time. Third,
where these terms and conditions prohibit sharing of
data, they actively inhibit the capacity of the research
community to test and validate findings, a cornerstone
of empirical research practice and trust in scientific
knowledge production.
Resolving these tensions calls for concerted action
by research agencies and other stakeholders to negoti-
ate with social media platforms not-for-profit access,
under suitable terms and conditions, to social media
datasets at no charge.13 Indeed, there are some grounds
for optimism. In the USA, for example, the Library of
Congress announced in 2010 that it had reached agree-
ment with Twitter on the archiving of all public tweets,
with the promise that the archive will be made available
to researchers.14 At the time of writing, the archive
remains inaccessible. Nor, of course, does the Library
of Congress plan cover other social media.
Our aim in the COSMOS project is to help confront
the challenges to the social sciences that have been
raised by Burawoy, Savage and Burrows and many
others. We are doing it by engaging with new forms
of social data and developing in COSMOS a resource
for public sociology that has citizen participation at its
heart. Social science is by no means the only discipline
in which knowledge production is changing and becom-
ing more `public': but it is probably the one in which
the change seems especially appropriate. Now research
can start to be done differently, and communicated dif-
ferently. These changes will inevitably force us to
rethink the role of the academic social scientist in the
future. One way forward would be for academic social
scientists to actively seek collaborations with groups,
both professional and lay, involved in doing various
kinds of `practical sociology'. Examples of the former
might include journalists15 who increasingly find them-
selves needing to analyse large datasets in order to
report news stories;16 examples of the latter might
include community activists who wish to engage with
policymakers over issues of concern. As academic
social scientists, we are intrigued by the prospects of
emulating the example of voluntary organizations
such as the Public Laboratory for Open Technology
and Science,17 which seek to promote the transfer of
skills and technologies for environmental science to
community groups.
Big and broad social data has given fresh stimulus to
debates about research ethics (see e.g. Boyd and
Crawford, 2012), much of which focuses on the issue
of people's right to privacy. At one level, we would
argue that questions about the `public' or `private'
character of the communications captured as big
social data, its panoptic use for mass surveillance and
its synoptic use for challenging elite constructions of
social problems and so forth, ought themselves to be
the subject of ongoing deliberation and empirical
inquiry as part of the search for a consensus. We
would also argue that we must not lose sight of the
broader issue of the ethics of research and innovation
(see e.g. Stahl et al., 2012). We see the promotion of a
public sociology as an important step towards both of
these objectives.
Finally, and following on from the above, the
boundaries of social science research practice are
becoming more porous. As with other disciplines,
social scientific knowledge production is changing,
potentially becoming more `public', the emergence of
citizen social science being a case in point, but also in
terms of the ways in which research is communicated
and the rise of the `networked researcher'. These devel-
opments require a rethinking of the role of the aca-
demic social scientist. The opportunity exists for
reinvigorating the programme for a `public sociology'.
Housley et al. 13
Taking this opportunity involves embracing openness
and public dialogue in a digital age, and having the
capacity to engage in timely ways ­ including in `real-
time' ­ with unfolding events and social problems as
they emerge.
