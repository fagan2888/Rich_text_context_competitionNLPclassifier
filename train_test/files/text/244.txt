Objectives: To examine the effect of measurement error in dietary data on the relationship between diet and
body mass index (BMI). To correct for the effect of measurement error on diet±BMI association by using
replicate measurements of diet. The effect of measurement error on diet±BMI relationship was simulated, and its
implications are discussed.
Design: Prospective study design.
Setting: The ®rst and second China Health and Nutrition Survey conducted in 1989 and 1991, respectively.
Subjects: Three thousand, four hundred and seventy-nine adults age 20±45 y at the 1989 survey.
Methods: Statistical methods were used to demonstrate the effect of measurement error in dietary data on the
diet-BMI association.
Results: By using the average of three replicate 24 h dietary recalls, the attenuation of diet-BMI association was
reduced substantially. The regression coef®cients of fat and energy intakes differed markedly from those
computed by using only single measurement of diet.
Conclusions: Measurement error in dietary data may signi®cantly attenuate the diet-disease association. Where
appropriate, speci®c emphasis may be needed to address the problem of measurement error in the study of diet-
disease relationship.

Introduction
Diet is a biologic exposure that is extremely dif®cult to
measure in the population. A central feature of dietary
intake of free-living individuals is the daily variation
superimposed on an underlying consistent pattern (Willett,
1990). For most epidemiologic studies, long-term diet
rather than intake on any speci®c day is the exposure of
interest. Estimates of long-term diet may be obtained by
using dietary assessment methods such as food frequency
questionnaires. In many situations, however, food intakes
during one or more days are measured. The effect of this is
to increase the standard deviation of intakes, that is, the
observed distribution has values that are higher and lower
than the true average for any subject (Willett, 1990).
Clearly, the dif®culty in obtaining accurate dietary data
from study population presents a major challenge in the
epidemiologic study of diet±disease relationship.
Measurement errors and its effects on the statistical
estimates and tests of hypotheses have been studied exten-
sively (Edwards, 1994, 1995; Fuller, 1987; Keiding, 1993;
Nakamura, 1990). In the area of nutrition, the nature of
variation in dietary intake and the measurement error
caused by such variation have also been studied (Beaton
et al, 1979; Clayton, 1994; Liu et al, 1978; Liu, 1989;
Plummer & Clayton, 1993). The within-person error caused
by daily variation in intake above and below individual's
true long-term intake has been studied in detail. It is the
major source of error in dietary data, although its magni-
tude varies by nutrient. Macronutrients tend to vary less
because they make large contributions to total energy
intake. Micronutrients tend to vary more because they are
often concentrated in certain foods, and their intakes are
strongly in¯uenced by food choices for the day (Willett,
1990).
Measurement errors in dietary data can be thought of as
random and systematic (Willett, 1990). For random errors,
the average value of many repeated measurements
approaches the true value. Each or both may occur at two
levels: within a person and between persons. Random
within-person error is exempli®ed by the day-to-day varia-
tion in food intake, as described above. It is the major
source of error in dietary data and it is the focus of this
paper. Random between-person error may be caused by
using only a few measurements per subject in the presence
of random within-person error. Systematic within-person
error is best typi®ed by under-reporting or over-reporting of
intake by some individuals, and systematic between-person
error results from systematic within-person error that
affects subjects nonrandomly. For example, using incorrect
nutrient composition values for some foods may appear to
affect all individuals in the same direction, but their
impacts are not the same since consumption of these

foods is likely to differ among subjects (Willett, 1990). To
date, there is no formal way to deal with systematic errors.
Other forms of error exist, such as those caused by mistakes
in reporting and recording of food intake by respondents
and interviewers. These types of error can not be corrected.
The following discussion focuses on the random within-
person error in dietary data that can distort the diet±disease
association of interest. Generally, the effect of this error is
to attenuate the strength of association, causing the correla-
tion or regression coef®cient to be biased toward zero
(Fuller, 1987; Willett, 1990). This has been long recog-
nized, and there are studies that have empirically demon-
strated such effect of measurement error on diet±disease
association (Davis et al, 1990; Frost et al, 1991; Liu, 1989).
Methods to adjust for the within-person error are available.
However, their use in the epidemiologic study of the diet-
disease relationship has been limited.
In this paper, we examined the effect of measurement
errors on the association between diet and body mass index
(BMI). First, we used the averages of two and three
replicate measurements of diet instead of single measure-
ment in the regression model of diet±BMI association. The
attenuation of regression coef®cients and the usefulness of
replicate measurements in reducing such attenuation were
demonstrated. Next, we used a statistical method to exam-
ine and simulate the relationship between the amount of
measurement error and its effect on the regression coef®-
cients, standard errors and con®dence intervals. The impli-
cations of measurement error in dietary data for
epidemiologic study of diet±disease relationship were dis-
cussed.
Methods
Survey data
The 1989 and 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey is a
longitudinal survey covering eight provinces in China.
Details of the survey design and survey data were given
elsewhere (Popkin et al, 1995).
All eligible adults, 20±45 y of age, were included in this
study. Of the 4675 adults with complete anthropometric
and dietary data at baseline (1989), 3479 individuals (74%)
also provided complete data in 1991. Our analysis showed
that the BMI, dietary intakes and other major character-
istics of individuals who were lost to follow-up did not
differ signi®cantly from those who remained in the study.
For example, the mean BMI and fat intake at baseline of
those who were lost to follow-up were 21.4 kg/m2 and 544
calories compared to 21.5 kg/m2 and 545 calories, respec-
tively, of those who remained in the study (P b 0.1).
Women who were pregnant or lactating at the time of
either survey (n  292) were excluded from analysis.
Dietary data were collected for three consecutive days.
The 24 h dietary recall was used to obtain data from each
person on each of the three days. From these data, daily
nutrient intakes were calculated using the of®cial 1991
Chinese Food Composition Table. All ®eld workers
involved in collecting dietary data were trained nutrition-
ists. Only individuals who had completed all three 24 h
recalls were included in this study.
Anthropometric data were collected by trained health
workers. Weight was measured in light indoor clothing to
the nearest tenth of a kilogram with a beam balance scale.
Height was measured without shoes to the nearest tenth of a
centimeter with a stadiometer. From these data, the body
mass index (BMI; weight in kg/height in m2) was calcu-
lated.
Physical activity data came from the reported physical
activity level at occupation. These were classi®ed into three
categories (sedentary, moderate and strenuous). Physical
activity was included in this analysis because it has impor-
tant in¯uence on the relationship between diet and body
weight.
Methods
Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the
relationship between diet, particularly fat intake, and the
BMI. Dietary intake, age, gender and physical activity data
from 1989 survey were used as independent variables and
the BMI data from 1991 survey were used as dependent
variable.
Since fat intake tends to be highly correlated with total
energy intake, the nutrient partition method was used to
divide total energy intake into the energy from fat and the
energy from sources other than fat (Howe, 1989). These
intakes were referred to as `fat intake' and `energy intake'
throughout this paper.

on the model

the regression coef®cient b1

(Fuller, 1987). An important
assumption for this model is that ut
is a random variable
that is independent, normally distributed, and is indepen-
dent of the true value xt
and of the conventional error et
. We
assumed that the dietary intakes were measured with error,
while other explanatory variables (age, gender and physical
activity) were measured without error.
Firstly, we used replicate measurements of diet to adjust
the regression coef®cients for random measurement errors.
The averages of two and three dietary recalls were used
instead of single recall in the regression model of diet-BMI
association. The ®rst, second and third dietary recalls were
labeled as Day 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The regression
model with single recall (Day 1) was estimated. Thereafter,
models with the average of two recalls (Day 1  Day 2)/2
and the average of three recalls (Day 1  Day 2  Day 3)/3
were estimated. The results from these three models were
compared. This approach reduces the random measurement
errors in the model by using the average of replicate
measurements of diet to approximate the true value.
Next, we simulated the effect of measurement errors on
the diet±BMI association. This was done by adjusting the
sum of squares and cross-products matrix of regression
coef®cients for a speci®ed amount of measurement error
variance (Fuller, 1987). From the regression model with
average of three recalls, we removed the hypothetical,
graded amounts of measurement error variance from the
total variances of fat and energy intakes and we observed
the changes in regression coef®cients. Since measurement
errors in fat intake is likely to be correlated with error in
energy intake, the corresponding amounts of fat-energy

error covariance were also removed from the total co-
variance of fat and energy intakes. The standard errors of
regression coef®cients were adjusted accordingly.
All analyses were done with SAS version 6.08, SAS
Interactive Matrix Language (SAS Institute, 1985 and
1992) and STATA release 4.0 (Stata Corporation, 1995).
Results
Women represented 53% of the study population of 3479
individuals. The mean (s.d.) age at baseline (1989) survey
was 33.1 (6.9) y. Of the total sample at baseline, 24%, 33%,
and 43% reported sedentary, moderate and strenuous phy-
sical activity, respectively.
Fat and energy intakes at the 1989 survey and weight,
height and BMI at the 1991 survey are shown in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, the standard deviations of fat and
energy intakes progressively decreased as the number of
replicate measurements increased.
Regression model with one 24 h dietary recall and
models with the averages of two and three recalls appear
in Table 2.
The regression coef®cients of fat and energy intakes
progressively increased as the number of replicate measure-
ments of diet increased. These increases were especially
marked when the average of two recalls were used instead
of one recall. The regression coef®cient of fat intake
increased by twofold, and the coef®cient of energy intake
increased by about 40% when the average of three recalls
was used instead of single recall.
Using the regression model with average of three recalls,
we examined the effect of hypothetical, graded increments
in amount of measurement error on the regression coef®-
cients. For this, we assumed that there were different
amounts of measurement error in dietary data, ranging
from 5 ± 40% of the total variances and covariance of fat
and energy intakes. The regression coef®cients and stan-
dard errors were then adjusted for the corresponding
amounts of measurement error assumed (Table 3, Figures
1 and 2).
The regression coef®cients and standard errors of fat and
energy intakes progressively increased as the increasing
amounts of measurement error were adjusted. In other
words, the increasing amount of error was associated with
increasing attenuation of diet±BMI association, which in
turn resulted in the increasing in¯ation (de-attenuation) of
regression coef®cients after serial adjustments. Figures 1
and 2 show that the increases in the regression coef®cients
and their con®dence intervals were not linear though the
range of measurement error assumed, that is, the effect of
measurement errors became increasingly marked when the
assumed amount of error variances exceeded 10 ±15% of
the total variances of fat and energy intakes.

Discussion
Epidemiologic study of diet±disease relationship is com-
plicated by the dif®culty in measuring the long-term
`habitual' diet in the study population. The commonly
used dietary assessment methods fall into two categories:
the frequency methods such as quantitative and semiquan-
titative food frequency questionnaires; and the daily con-
sumption methods such as food record and 24 h dietary
recall (Liu, 1989). A well-designed frequency method may
give a good approximation of long-term diet. However,
they do not give meaningful absolute values of intake (Liu,
1989). The daily consumption methods give meaningful
absolute values of intake, but they are extremely vulnerable
to the daily (within-person) variation unless adequate
number of replicate measurements are collected.
The following discussion applies to studies that use daily
consumption methods. We have shown that measurement
errors attenuated the diet-BMI association, and the use of
replicate measurements of diet can substantially reduce this
effect. The collection of replicate measurements of diet,
however, is not always possible or feasible. Studies that
involve micronutrients usually require a large number of
replicates, and such undertaking can be complicated and
expensive. For macronutrients, however, a small number of
replicates may suf®ce since it has been shown that although
the minimum variance may be obtained from several
replicate measurements, two replicates provide a variance
that is not far from optimal in most situations (Rosner &
Willett, 1988). Results from our study support this view.
Day-to-day variation in dietary intake is the main source
of measurement error in dietary data. If the replicate
measurements of diet are available, there are statistical
methods that may be used to correct the diet-disease
association for within-person error. These are the reliability
ratio (Fleiss, 1986; Fuller, 1987; Snedecor & Cochran,
1980) and the correction factor (Beaton et al, 1979; Willett,
1990). Also, the within-person variance may be used to
adjust the regression coef®cients (Fuller, 1987). All of
these methods are aimed at removing the within-person
variation from dietary data, and our separate investigation
showed that they produce consistent results. In theory,
results from these methods may be viewed as an approx-
imation of results that would otherwise be obtained if the
estimates of long-term diet were available.
Our simulation showed that for a given observed asso-
ciation, an increasing amount of measurement error was
associated with an increasing attenuation of regression
coef®cients. Moreover, the effect of measurement error
on the regression coef®cients and con®dence intervals
may not be linear, and may be marked when measurement
error variance accounts for more than 10 ±15% of the total
variance. This suggests that a true but weak diet±disease
relationship may be partially or completely obscured by a
relatively small amount of measurement error in dietary
data.
Measurement error models are based on several assump-
tions, among them that the observed variation at a given
time is independent. This assumption may not hold in
studies that use data from food diaries or dietary recalls
conducted on consecutive days. For example, it is possible
that over-eating on one day may be followed by under-
eating the next day (El Lozy, 1983). For practical reasons,
the China Health and Nutrition Survey used the consecutive
24 h dietary recalls. Therefore, the possible violation of this
assumption is a major weakness of this study. If over-eating
on one day leads to under-eating the next day, then the
within-person variation is exaggerated. On the other hand,
if the meals on one day consist mostly of left-over foods
from previous day, then the within-person variance is
underestimated. To deal with this problem, the replicate
measurements of diet must be collected at random, pre-
ferably several days apart. Such problem re¯ects the
dif®culty in collecting measurements of diet from large
number of subjects.
A type of measurement error that is especially relevant
to epidemiologic study of diet and body weight is the
systematic within-person error caused by under-reporting
of dietary intake by some overweight individuals (Braitman
et al, 1985) and by deliberate dieting in response to weight
gain (Lissner & Heitmann, 1995). The effect of this error
on diet±body weight relationship can not be estimated, but
it is likely to be signi®cant in many situations. These
behaviors are especially common in the Western popula-
tions where obesity is considered to be a health and social
disadvantage and where high-fat diet is being actively
avoided. However, we believe that the magnitude of this
error in our data was small. Our preliminary analysis
showed that individuals with high BMI (for example,
BMI greater than 25 or 30) reported higher fat intake
than their counterparts, both in absolute value and as the
percentage of total energy intake. Moreover, in China and
in many developing countries, both obesity and high-fat
`af¯uent' diet are often associated with good health and
high social status (Sobal & Stunkard, 1989; The World
Health Organization, 1990). Therefore, healthy individuals
who are experiencing rapid weight gain may not perceive
the condition as hazardous to their health, and the over-
weight individuals may be indifferent to further weight gain
(Paeratakul et al, 1998).
Conclusions
Our ®ndings suggest that measurement error in dietary data
may be responsible for the weak or missing association in
studies where there are strong biologic evidence to support
the existence of diet±disease relationships. Therefore, in
situations where dietary intakes are subject to large day-to-
day variation, collection of replicate measurements of diet
and the use of a method to adjust for within-person
variation may be considered.
In designing an epidemiologic study of diet±disease
relationship, the investigator must therefore decide whether
to enroll many subjects and collect few replicates per
person, or to enroll few subjects and collect many replicates
(Willett, 1990). The answer is not simple, even with a
method to determine the number of days necessary to
estimate the true intake (Liu et al, 1978; El Lozy, 1983).
This decision depends on several factors, such as the
feasibility, cost, and the expected strength of the diet-
disease association.
Measurement error in dietary data has important impli-
cations for the epidemiologic study of diet±disease relation-
ships. The within-person error is of particular importance in
studies that collect dietary data by using the daily con-
sumption methods. Major implications include the selection
of a suitable dietary instrument, the estimation of optimum
number of replicate measurements of diet, and the calcula-
tion of appropriate sample size. For example, if the effect
of measurement error on diet±disease association is

ignored, the sample size is likely to be miscalculated
(Rappaport et al, 1995). Moreover, in the studies that
involve nutrients with high within-person variation or
food items that are not consumed frequently, it may be
appropriate to collect dietary data by using a frequency
method such as food frequency questionnaires which pro-
vides direct estimate of long-term intake. Therefore a pre-
planned effort to reduce measurement error before the
actual data collection may help to reveal the diet-disease
relationship of interest and to reduce the number of subjects
and/or replicate measurements required.
