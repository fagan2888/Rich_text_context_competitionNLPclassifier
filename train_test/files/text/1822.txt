Abstract
Background: Studies derived from continuous national surveys have shown that the prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the US is increasing. This study estimated the prevalence in 2004
of self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and other conditions in a community-based population, using
data from the Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to
Diabetes (SHIELD).
Methods: The initial screening questionnaire was mailed in 2004 to a stratified random sample of
200,000 households in the US, to identify individuals, age  18 years of age, with diabetes or risk
factors associated with diabetes. Follow-up disease impact questionnaires were then mailed to a
representative, stratified random sample of individuals (n = 22,001) in each subgroup of interest
(those with diabetes or different numbers of risk factors for diabetes). Estimated national
prevalence of diabetes and other conditions was calculated, and compared to prevalence estimates
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002.
Results: Response rates were 63.7% for the screening, and 71.8% for the follow-up baseline
survey. The SHIELD screening survey found overall prevalence of self-reported diagnosis of
diabetes (either type 1 or type 2) was 8.2%, with increased prevalence with increasing age and
decreasing income. In logistic regression modeling, individuals were more likely to be diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes if they had abdominal obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.50; p < 0.0001), BMI 28

kg/m2 (OR = 4.04; p < 0.0001), or had been diagnosed with dyslipidemia (OR = 3.95; p < 0.0001),
hypertension (OR = 4.82; p < 0.0001), or with cardiovascular disease (OR = 3.38; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: The SHIELD design allowed for a very large, community-based sample with broad
demographic representation of the population of interest. When comparing results from the
SHIELD screening survey (self-report only) to those from NHANES 1999­2002 (self-report,
clinical and laboratory evaluations), the prevalence of diabetes was similar. SHIELD allows the
identification of respondents with and without a current diagnosis of the illness of interest, and
potential longitudinal evaluation of risk factors for future diagnosis of that illness.
Background
Studies have shown that the prevalence of diagnosed dia-
betes mellitus (DM) in the US is increasing. Mokdad et
al.[1], using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS), a cross-sectional telephone survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and state health departments, showed that the preva-
lence of self-reported diagnosis of DM increased from
4.9% in 1990 to 6.5% in 1998 to 7.3% in 2000 [1,2].
Using data from four consecutive National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys, Kanjilal et al. [3] showed
a similar, significant increase in prevalence of self-
reported diagnosis of DM, as well as a significant increase
in total (diagnosed and undiagnosed) prevalence of DM.
Further, they showed that DM prevalence increased most
among persons with lower income and education levels
[3].
The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence
in 2004 of self-reported diagnosis of DM and prevalence
of specific risk factors associated with diabetes in a com-
munity-based population. Additionally, individuals with
risk factors for diabetes were identified to determine sim-
ilarities and differences with diabetes patients. SHIELD
(Study to Help Improve Earlyevaluation and manage-
ment of risk factors Leading to Diabetes), the largest sur-
vey of its kind, began with an initial cross-sectional
snapshot of the US population, followed by longitudinal
questionnaires designed to evaluate parameters poten-
tially related to DM, and is the first prospective study to
examine select risk factors (RFs) for future diagnoses of
DM. This study was also designed to provide insight into
health-related knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes as well
as their implications for individuals' transitions to a DM
diagnosis and progression of DM treatments. The SHIELD
design and methodology are described herein, along with
the initial, cross-sectional results of parameters related to
DM compared with findings from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­
2002 data.
Methods
SHIELD consists of three phases: 1) an initial screening,
cross-sectional survey that used a general population
screening questionnaire to identify cases of interest; 2) the
baseline survey, in which the identified respondents were
followed up longitudinally with a longer, more detailed
questionnaire assessing each individual's health status,
health knowledge and attitudes, and current behaviors
and treatments; and 3) annual follow-up questionnaires
to assess disease progression, which encompassed a) tran-
sition from at risk status to diagnosed DM, b) progression
of treatment over the course of the disease, and c) the
associated clinical and economic burden. Results from the
first two phases are presented here. Respondents volun-
teered to complete the surveys without compensation.
Screening questionnaire
The initial screening questionnaire was mailed in April
2004 to a stratified random sample of 200,000 house-
holds in the US. These households were a part of the Tay-
lor Nelson Sofres National Family Opinion, Inc. (TNS
NFO) survey panel, which is a market research firm that
maintains a panel of households throughout the US for
marketing and research purposes. The panel was con-
structed to be representative of the US population in terms
of residence (including both geographic region and
household area population size), age of the head of
household and household income and size. The require-
ments for participation included being 18 years of age and
having a telephone and mailing address. Random sam-
ples of households were invited to enroll in the panel, and
demographic information was obtained from those who
enroll (and updated every 2 years). Households who
agreed to participate were invited to take part in periodic
surveys. The NFO panel has been used previously to deter-
mine general population prevalence of migraine [4,5],
bipolar disorder [6], disease related impairment [7-9],
and depression and comorbidity in epilepsy and asthma
[10].
The SHIELD screening survey used 12 questions created
by an expert advisory panel to identify individuals with
DM (and type of DM) or RFs associated with a diagnosis
of DM. After being mailed, the screening questionnaire
was completed by the head of the household who
answered for up to four adult members of the household
(18 years of age). The head of household was identified
BMC Public Health 2007, 7:277 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/277

as the individual who is the panel member for the NFO
panel and typically was the adult female of the household.
Due to the self-administration approach, the head of
household was able to consult with other adult family
members and personal health records to report whether
they or any adult member had been told by their doctor
or nurse that they had any of the conditions.
Risk factors (RFs) associated with diabetes mellitus
In addition to self-reported DM, the screening question-
naire included the following items: age, family history,
adiposity (as measured by body mass index [BMI]) and
presence of potential DM-related predictors such as
abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and car-
diovascular disease (CVD) events. The SHIELD data were
analyzed and compared with overall prevalence estimates
from NHANES 1999­2002 data (which used both self-
reported and laboratory values). The following factors
were hypothesized to be associated with a diagnosis of
DM: (1) abdominal obesity (waist circumference), (2) over-
weight/obesity (BMI, calculated from self-reported height
and weight), (3) cholesterol problems (reported diagnosis of
cholesterol problems of any type), (4) hypertension
(reported diagnosis of high blood pressure), and (5) his-
tory of CVD ("heart disease/myocardial infarction, narrow
or blocked arteries, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft
surgery/angioplasty/stents/surgery to clear arteries").
Respondents were provided with a measuring tape and
while standing were asked to hold the tape measure
loosely around their waist at the level of their navel
("belly button") to determine waist circumference.
These CVD parameters were confirmed using logistic
regression analyses on the SHIELD screening data, which
indicated that each RF had independent and similar pre-
dictive power for diagnosis of DM. Specific thresholds for
waist circumference and BMI were determined as
described below in "Data Analysis."
Sampling for baseline survey
Once the screening questionnaire was returned, baseline
(BL) follow-up disease impact questionnaires were
mailed in September and October of 2004 to a represent-
ative stratified random sample of individuals based upon
several subgroups of interest, which included: (1) type 1
DM (defined as reported type 1 diagnosis made at age 21
years plus insulin use), (2) type 2 DM (defined as reported
type 2 diagnosis made at age >21 years), and (3) individ-
uals without DM but with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 RFs. Less than
12% of baseline survey respondents were from the same
household and the correlation between responses for
individuals from the same household was minimal (r <
0.03) and not statistically significant. After the BL ques-
tionnaires were returned, a subgroup of 600 responses
was created from the total response pool to represent a
general population sample for comparison with the DM
and RF groups. This "population-based" control group
sampled returns from the type 1 and type 2 DM groups
and each RF level in proportions to reflect the overall prev-
alence of that stratum in the general population. This
group was constructed by stratified random sampling
(without replacement) of 600 individuals from within the
disease and RF groups in proportion to their rates of
occurrence in the population (as estimated from the
screening study).
Baseline (BL) questionnaire
The BL questionnaire consisted of 64 detailed questions
regarding comorbidities, symptoms, and family history;
medical testing; health-related quality of life, depression
and health-related disruptions of normal activities; diet,
exercise and other health-related behaviors; healthcare
insurance coverage and resource use; and impact of health
problems on work productivity.
The BL questionnaire also included several validated sur-
vey instruments including: (1) the 12-item Short Form
Health Survey [11] (SF-12v2;) and the European Quality
of Life (EuroQoL) EQ-5D instrument [12-15] to assess
quality of life; (2) Sheehan Disability Scale [16] to assess
the level of disruption felt in work, social life, and family/
home life due to health problems; (3) 9-item Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [17] to assess depression;
and (4) the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
Questionnaire: General Health, version 2.0 (WPAI-GH)
to assess work productivity and performance of other reg-
ular activities [18].
In addition, the questionnaire included some, but not all,
questions from the following instruments: the Diet and
Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS), the Press-Ganey Satis-
faction Questionnaire, and the International Physical
Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which was developed to
assess health-related aspects of physical activity and sed-
entary behaviors [19].
Data analysis
Estimated national prevalence of DM and each RF was cal-
culated using SHIELD and NHANES data. Logistic regres-
sion analyses of the SHIELD screening data with diagnosis
of type 2 DM as the dependent variable and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and RFs as explanatory variables
were used to identify those factors associated with being
diagnosed with type 2 DM. In addition, specific thresh-
olds for waist circumference and BMI were determined
separately for men and women, using the area under
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to quantify
sensitivity and specificity. The waist circumference or BMI
value that maximized the area under the ROC curve was
chosen as the threshold (point that maximized the

number of people correctly classified as diabetes or not)
for determining whether that RF (i.e., "abdominal obes-
ity" or "high BMI") was present. Odds ratios around the
threshold were stable. The ROC analysis was done to
determine diabetes-specific thresholds for obesity (BMI)
and abdominal obesity (waist circumference) rather than
using the continuous variable for these factors; and the
ROC model with the continuous variables was only
slightly improved over the dichotomous variable. The
sensitivity of the model predicting diabetes (duration  3
years) was 0.63 (range = 0.61­0.70) and specificity was
0.80 (range = 0.75­0.82). Analyses of the areas under the
ROC curves for abdominal obesity found an optimal cut-
off value at waist circumference  97 cm for men and waist
circumference  89 cm for women. For BMI, the optimal
threshold value was  28 kg/m2 in both men and women.
RF levels were calculated as the unweighted number of
RFs reported by each respondent on the screening ques-
tionnaire. For example, if a person reported three RFs on
the screening questionnaire, they were classified into RF
level 3. Most analyses of the SHIELD BL data reported here
grouped individuals into cohorts with lower risk (0­2
RFs) or higher risk (3­5 RFs). Data reported here reflect
the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents
to the BL survey and the occurrence rates of each RF
among our respondent subgroups.
Results
Response rates and analyzed cohort
Of the 200,000 households that received the screening
questionnaire, 127,420 households (containing a total of
211,097 adults) returned usable questionnaires, yielding
a response rate of 63.7% for the screening survey. The fol-
low-up BL survey was mailed to a total of 22,001 individ-
uals, and 17,640 were returned, for a response rate of
80.2%. The total number of usable (i.e., no missing val-
ues) returns was 15,794 (71.8%).
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus and risk factors
The SHIELD screening survey revealed that the overall
prevalence of self-reported diagnosis of DM (either type 1
or type 2) was 8.2% for the 211,097 respondents, with
increased prevalence with increasing age (Table 1). In
comparison, the overall DM prevalence in NHANES for
self-report was 6.5% and 9.0% for self-report and clinical
and laboratory evaluations, with approximately 2.5% of
the 9.0% undiagnosed.
The prevalence estimates for each of the 5 RFs, as found in
the SHIELD and NHANES studies, are also shown in Table
1. The estimated proportions of the population with BMI
28 kg/m2 (obese) and history of CVD events were gener-
ally similar in SHIELD and NHANES, while the preva-
lence of abdominal obesity and of dyslipidemia estimated
in SHIELD were lower than from NHANES.

Logistic regression analysis results
The logistic regression model of factors associated with
diagnosis of type 2 DM in the screening data is shown in
Table 2. Individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with
type 2 DM if they had abdominal obesity (odds ratio [OR]
= 3.50; p < 0.0001), or had been diagnosed with dyslipi-
demia (OR = 3.95; p < 0.0001) or hypertension (OR =
4.82; p < 0.0001). A BMI 28 kg/m2 also put individuals
at a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with type
2 DM (OR = 4.04; p < 0.0001), as did a prior CV event (OR
= 3.38, p < 0.0001).
After adjusting for other factors in the model, men were
more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 DM than women
(OR = 1.18; p < 0.001). African Americans were at a higher
risk for being diagnosed with type 2 DM than were indi-
viduals who responded white for race (OR = 1.67). Lower
household income and increased age were also associated
with increased odds of type 2 DM diagnosis.

(n = 368) and type 2 DM (n = 3,898), and 0­2 (n = 5,295)
and 3­5 RF (n = 5,400) groups are shown in Additional
File 1. US census data are also included for comparison.
Younger age groups, African Americans, and Asian Amer-
icans were generally under-represented in the study popu-
lation, compared with US census data.
With some exceptions, in general, the sociodemographic
characteristics of the population sample group and US
census data were similar to those seen in the 0­2 RF
group. In contrast, at least with regard to age, income, and
household size, the 3­5 RF group had sociodemographic
characteristics more similar to the type 2 DM group. The
type 1 DM group tended to be younger and the type 2 DM
group tended to be older than the population sample. In
summary, the 3­5 RF and type 2 DM groups tended to be
older, and to have lower incomes and smaller household
size compared to the 0­2 RF group, population control
sample, and US census. The lower income and smaller
household size relationship for the 3­5 RF and type 2 DM
groups remained even with age stratification.
RF proportions
The proportion of respondents with individual RFs within
each subgroup of interest are shown in Table 3. The type
1 DM group had similar proportions of abdominal obes-
ity and BMI 28 as the population sample and the 0­2 RF
groups. Both the type 1 and type 2 DM subgroups had a
higher likelihood of being diagnosed with dyslipidemia,
hypertension, and CVD events (perhaps in part related to
more intensive medical evaluations once being diagnosed
with DM) compared to the population sample and 0­2 RF
group. The type 2 DM group and the 3­5 RF group had
generally similar individual RF proportions and a similar
average number of risk factors. Approximately 78% of the
type 2 DM group had 3­5 risk factors. Finally, within each
subgroup, CVD was the least frequently reported RF.
Discussion
The SHIELD design allowed for a very large, community-
based sample with broad demographic representation of
the population of interest. The use of the TNS NFO house-
hold survey panel also resulted in a high response rate for

a written survey. The completion of the questionnaire in
the home setting allowed for thoughtful answers and for
time to check records and medications for accurate report-
ing. In addition, the respondents could work at their pace,
and there was no interviewer bias. Any sampling bias due
to demographics can be measured and adjusted for in the
final analysis. Finally, the survey allowed the identifica-
tion of respondents without a current diagnosis of the ill-
ness of interest, and potential longitudinal evaluation of
RFs for future diagnosis of that illness.
SHIELD consists of a cross-sectional, and then 5-year lon-
gitudinal observational study of individuals with or at risk
for DM. A large number of the cross-sectional, screening
questionnaires were sent and a high return rate was
achieved, providing a sample that was generally represent-
ative of the overall US population. The BL survey was
designed to provide a more detailed view of DM and other
health conditions in a large sample that will be followed
over 4 subsequent annual surveys. The overall response
rate for the BL survey (80%) was also quite high for a
large, mailed survey.
Demographically, the population sample was generally
similar to US census data, indicating that the SHIELD
results are representative and generalizable to the US pop-
ulation. The population sample and the 0­2 RF groups
were also similar to each other. One important result from
this survey was the similarity of the 3­5 RF and the type 2
DM groups. Results from SHIELD reveal that the mean
number of RFs increases with age, as does the likelihood
of being diagnosed with DM. The proportion of individ-
ual RFs was highest in the type 2 DM and 3­5 RF groups,
with somewhat higher percentages for each of the five
individual RFs in the 3­5 RF group as compared with the
type 2 DM group. The 3­5 RF group has not been diag-
nosed with diabetes but they appear similar to the type 2
DM group, which is not explained by age stratification.
This finding may indicate the importance of managing the
risk factors in the 3­5 RF group to delay or prevent diabe-
tes. Importantly, in follow-up surveys, it may be possible
to determine which RFs in those persons without DM best
correlate to a future diagnosis of DM. The similarity in
prevalence rates of DM between SHIELD and NHANES
confirm that surveys like SHIELD, with self-reported diag-
noses, acquire data approximating surveys that also
include clinical and laboratory evaluations.
The lower prevalence of dyslipidemia and abdominal
obesity in SHIELD versus NHANES may be largely due to
the use of laboratory data (cholesterol levels) and inter-
viewer measurement in NHANES compared with only
self-report in SHIELD. For diagnoses that are dependent
on laboratory evaluations, particularly when more than
one laboratory parameter is used to define a specific diag-
nosis (such as dyslipidemia), self-report surveys may
underestimate the true prevalence of these diagnoses.
Multivariate analysis indicated that smaller household
size, population size and the US South were independ-
ently associated with a higher likelihood of type 2 DM
diagnosis. These associations may be due to differences in
diet, lifestyle habits, access to medical and/or diabetes
care and limited family support.
It should be noted that panel data have some limitations.
For example, only a small percentage (5%­8%) of con-
sumers invited to participate in the NFO panel elected to
do so, leading to the possibility of bias. Household panels
tend to under-represent the very wealthy and very poor
segments of the population, and do not include military
or institutionalized individuals. However, these limita-
tions are true for most random sampling and clinically
based methodologies as well.
Another limitation is that data collected by self-reported
surveys cannot always be directly compared to clinical
and laboratory surveys, such as NHANES data. This is
especially true in trying to assess clustering of CVD risk
factors.
Currently, further analyses of the screening and BL survey
data are in progress, to investigate differences in health
attitudes and behaviors between survey respondents with
type 1 and type 2 DM and those with 3­5 RFs. It is antici-
pated that the long-term, longitudinal data from SHIELD
will allow for continued clarification of predictors of
being tested for or being diagnosed with DM. In addition,
it is possible that SHIELD data may help identify those
RFs (and health attitudes and behaviors) that are most
predictive of transitioning from one stage of DM to the
next (disease progression) and from one stage of DM
treatment to the next (treatment progression).
Conclusion
When comparing results from the SHIELD screening sur-
vey to those from NHANES 1999­2002 (self-report and
clinical and laboratory evaluations), the prevalence of DM
was similar. In addition, the prevalence of DM observed
in SHIELD increased with higher ages and lower income
levels. Multivariable analyses of the SHIELD baseline sur-
vey data found that abdominal obesity, higher BMI, and
diagnosis of cholesterol problems, hypertension or CVD
were each independently associated with higher likeli-
hood of type 2 DM diagnosis. Other factors positively
associated with type 2 DM diagnosis were increased age,
black race, and decreased household income level.
SHIELD is an ongoing self-reported survey study that
began with a cross-sectional questionnaire, followed by
targeted longitudinal surveys, and is the largest survey of

its kind. Because a large number of questionnaires were
sent with a high return rate achieved, the SHIELD survey
achieved a large sample that is representative of the over-
all US population. SHIELD provides information that is
unique from data more commonly reported, especially
regarding the longitudinal follow-up on a large sample,
which may allow correlation of RFs with the future diag-
nosis of DM.
