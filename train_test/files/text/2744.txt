Differences in Nutrient Intake Associated
With State Laws Regarding Fat, Sugar,
and Caloric Content of Competitive Foods
Daniel R. Taber, PhD; Jamie F. Chriqui, PhD, MHS; Frank J. Chaloupka, PhD
Objective: To determine whether nutrient intake is
healthier among high school students in California, which
regulates the nutrition content of competitive foods sold
in high schools, than among students in states with no
such standards.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: California and 14 states without high school
competitive food nutrition standards in the 2009-2010
school year.
Participants: A total of 680 high school students sampled
in February through May 2010 as part of the National
Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study.
Interventions: State laws governing fat, sugar, and ca-
loric content of competitive foods sold in vending ma-
chines, school stores, and cafeterias (à la carte).
Main Outcome Measures: Several measures of nu-
trient intake assessed by 24-hour recall, overall and strati-
fied by location of consumption (school, home, other).
Results: On average, California students reported con-
suming less fat, sugar, and total calories at school than
students in states with no competitive food nutrition stan-
dards. California students also reported less at-school in-
take of vitamins and minerals. All at-school differences
in nutrient intake were null after adjusting for total ca-
loric intake; California students consumed a lower pro-
portion of their daily calories in school (21.5%) than stu-
dents in other states (28.4%). Mean overall intake was
lower in California for most measures that were ana-
lyzed, particularly added sugars.
Conclusions: California high school students con-
sumed lower quantities of fat, sugar, and calories in
school than students in states with no competitive
food nutrition standards, but the nutrition composi-
tion of California students' in-school diet was similar.
Policy initiatives should promote competitive foods
that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans.

SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMON-
stratedthepoornutritioncon-
tent of foods and beverages
sold in schools in the United
States.1-6 Federally reimburs-
able school meals must abide by nutrition
standards set by the US Department of Ag-
riculture, but individual foods and bever-
ages sold in vending machines, school
stores, and cafeterias (à la carte) have his-
torically been exempt from federal regula-
tion except for restrictions on the sale of
foods of minimal nutrition value.7-9 Foods
of minimal nutrition value include only a
small number of specific items such as hard
candies, gum, and soda. Competitive foods
are commonly foods of high caloric den-
sity and low nutrient density,2,5 and school
food environments tend to become pro-
gressively less healthy at higher grade lev-
els.1,5 In 2007-2008, 77% of high schools
nationwide offered regular-fat and sugar
snacks in competitive venues.3
Policy initiatives designed to regulate
nutrition content of competitive foods are
increasingly being promoted at the fed-
eral, state, and local levels.10-14 The Healthy,
Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires,
among several provisions, that the US De-
partment of Agriculture develop regula-
tions specifying nutrition standards for all
competitive foods sold in schools that par-
ticipate in federally reimbursable school
meal programs.11 This will be the first at-
tempt to regulate competitive food nutri-
tion content on a national scale, al-
though some states have already taken
legislative and/or regulatory action to
implement similar standards.12-14 As imple-

mentation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010
begins, policy makers can benefit from research on ex-
isting state regulations to identify areas where stan-
dards have been successful as well as potential pitfalls.
California was one of the first states to regulate com-
petitive food nutrition content.7 State Senate Bill 12, ef-
fective July 2007, required several nutrition standards for
competitive foods at all grade levels, including limiting
the number of calories and the fat, saturated fat, and sugar
content of snacks sold in schools.15 State Senate Bill 965
banned the sale of soda and other sweetened beverages
in high schools and was scheduled to be fully imple-
mented by July 2009.15 Several studies have docu-
mented California's success in improving the nutrition
content of competitive foods since the laws went into ef-
fect.16-18 Woodward-Lopez et al18 collected several mea-
suresoffoodandbeverageavailabilityinCaliforniaschools
and student intake of select food items and reported sev-
eral improvements following implementation of State Sen-
ate Bill 12. They were cautiously optimistic, though, as
they found that many compliant foods and beverages had
limited nutrition value and that at-school intake of veg-
etables declined following the legislation. Without using
another state as a control, it is also difficult to determine
whether the positive changes in California were attrib-
utable to legislation or reflected secular trends taking place
nationwide.
This study was designed to complement existing re-
search on California's competitive food laws by compar-
ing nutrient intake among high school students in Cali-
fornia vs states that do not regulate competitive food
nutrition content, using 24-hour recall data. In addition
to analyzing several measures of overall intake, we com-
pared intake in different locations outside school to as-
sess whether California students compensate for school
changes by consuming more elsewhere.
METHODS
POLICY DATA
State laws regarding the nutrition content of competitive foods
sold in high schools for the 2009-2010 school year were com-
piled as part of the Bridging the Gap research program.19 State
laws were compiled from the subscription-based Westlaw and
Lexis-Nexis legal research databases through primary legal re-
search methods.20,21 Laws were defined to include codified state
statutory and administrative (ie, regulatory) laws effective as
of September 2009. Analyses in this study are based on 9 dif-
ferent provisions--laws regarding 3 specific types of nutrition
content (fat, sugar, total calories) for foods in each of 3 set-
tings (vending machines, school stores, cafeteria [à la carte]).
Each state's law was 100% double-coded by 2 trained cod-
ers and verified against secondary sources to ensure complete
collection and coding interpretation.22-25 Laws were coded using
an adaptation of a reliable and valid coding tool originally cre-
ated to evaluate district-level policies and further modified to
specifically evaluate nutrition content standards for each loca-
tion of sale.13,26 Individual provisions were categorized as strong
if they were required, specified an implementation plan or strat-
egy, and included language such as shall, must, and enforce.
Laws were classified as weak if they were suggested or recom-
mended and included language such as should, might, and try.
California was classified as strong for all 9 provisions included
in this study. At the high school level, California's law re-
quired that snacks contain no more than 35% of total calories
from fat, no more than 10% of total calories from saturated fat,
no more than 35% of its total weight from naturally occurring
and added sugars, and no more than 250 calories per item and
that competitive food entre
´e items contain no more than 400
calories and no more than 4 g of fat per 100 calories.27
STUDENT DATA
Student data on nutrient intake were obtained from the Na-
tional Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS),
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion.28 The NYPANS included a written survey of diet and physi-
cal activity behaviors administered to a nationally representa-
tive sample of 9th- through 12th-grade students as well as a
telephone interview with a subsample of students to collect de-
tailed information on nutrient intake using 24-hour recall.
Among the 168 schools sampled as part of the NYPANS, 138
agreed to participate in the written survey component. Each
school was invited to participate in the 24-hour recall compo-
nent, and 60 volunteered to do so. Among the 1416 students
in these schools who were eligible for the 24-hour recall, 1229
provided contact information for the telephone interview. In-
terviews were conducted in February through May 2010.
As part of the 24-hour recall, students provided detailed data
on food intake and location of consumption for the day prior
to the interview. Students participated in up to 3 recalls, but
for the sake of consistency we used only the first weekday 24-
hour recall for each student, unless otherwise noted. Nutrient
intake data were compiled using Nutrition Data System for Re-
search software (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of
Minnesota). In addition to calculating overall daily intake, we
stratified the calculations by location of consumption--
school, home, and other (eg, restaurants).
Twenty states were represented in the 24-hour recall sample.
OurstudysamplewasrestrictedtostudentsinCalifornia(n=114)
and 14 states with no laws for the majority of the 9 domains listed
earlier (n=566; within-state median sample size=44.5). We spe-
cifically focused on these states to make results more interpre-
table and to improve the internal validity of our analyses. Four
states that had a mixture of strong, weak, and no relevant laws
were excluded because they would create a very heterogeneous
comparison group that would be difficult to characterize. One
state other than California had strong provisions across do-
mains, but it was excluded because it had a small sample of stu-
dents who completed a 24-hour recall (n=12). Combining the
other state with California would overstate the geographic scope
of our treatment group and potentially bias results.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
General linear models were used to estimate differences in av-
erage dietary intake between students in California and states
that did not have laws regarding the nutrition content of com-
petitive foods. First, we estimated differences in the following:
(1) total caloric intake, overall and stratified by location of con-
sumption; (2) proportions of total calories consumed in the
forms of protein, carbohydrates, and different types of fat (satu-
rated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated); and (3) total in-
take of macronutrients and micronutrients (sugars, fiber, and
several vitamins and minerals). We then estimated differences
in macronutrient and micronutrient intake, stratified by loca-
tion of consumption, and repeated each analysis with and with-
out adjustment for total caloric intake. Each analysis adjusted
for race/ethnicity, age, sex, and where students obtained their

lunch on school days (school, home, other, none). We ex-
plored controlling for school-level clustering but determined
that within-school correlation of nutrient intake was low and
that controlling for it could bias the estimates.
The California sample had a substantially higher propor-
tion of Hispanic students than other states. We repeated the
analyses in Hispanic students only to determine whether nu-
trient intake was more favorable in California, specifically among
this population that tends to have higher prevalence of youth
obesity, particularly among boys.29,30
As a supplementary analysis, we modeled within-student dif-
ferences between weekday and weekend intake, stratified by
location of consumption, in the overall sample. The purpose
was to explore whether students in California compensated for
changes to their school environment by consuming more at
home or other locations during the school week, relative to stu-
dents in states that did not govern competitive food nutrition
content. A fixed-effect model was used to estimate within-
student differences between weekday and weekend consump-
tion at home and in locations outside school and home and to
compare these differences between California and other states.
Each student's weekend intake effectively served as his or her
own control and enabled us to adjust for unmeasured charac-
teristics such as socioeconomic status. This analysis was re-
stricted to students who completed one 24-hour recall for both
a weekday and a weekend day (n=515).
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of the University of Illinois at Chicago. All statistical analyses
were conducted with Stata version 11 statistical software
(StataCorp LP).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of the study sample can be found
in Table 1. As described earlier, the California sample
had a greater proportion of Hispanic students (76.6%)
than other states included in the sample (14.7%). The
sex and age distributions were approximately equal be-
tween the 2 groups. All census regions were repre-
sented in the sample of states with no competitive food
nutrition standards, although the sample contained a rela-
tively high proportion of students from the South (54.4%).
Adjusted differences in mean intake between Califor-
nia and states with no competitive food nutrition stan-
dards are displayed in Table 2. California students con-
sumed a mean of 157.8 fewer calories (95% CI, -371.0
to 55.5), with the difference coming largely from at-
school intake (=-170.0; 95% CI, -288.8 to -51.2). Over-
all, California students consumed less of almost every nu-
trient that we examined. When taking both effect size and
precision into account, the strongest evidence of lower
intake among California students was found when ana-
lyzing total sugars (=-17.9; 95% CI, -36.1 to 0.4) and
added sugars (=-17.5; 95% CI, -34.3 to -0.8).

California students consumed a relatively low pro-
portion of their calories at school compared with stu-
dents in other states (21.5% vs 28.4%, respectively) and
a relatively high proportion outside school and home
(19.8% vs 14.1%, respectively). Differences in nutrient
intake by location are presented in Table 3. At school,
California students consumed less than students in other
states for every measure that we examined, particularly
added sugars, trans fat, monounsaturated fat, sodium, po-
tassium, iron, and vitamin B12
. After adjusting for total
caloric intake, however, the at-school differences were
substantially reduced. In some cases, the direction of as-
sociation changed after adjusting for total calories, such
that California students consumed more of specific nu-
trients (eg, calcium) than students in other states. Mean
intake from locations other than school and home was
higher in California for most measures; intake of fiber,
vitamin B12
, sodium, and iron remained higher in Cali-
fornia after adjusting for total calories. There were vir-
tually no differences between states in at-home intake,
regardless of whether we adjusted for total caloric in-
take (results not shown).
Results were very similar when restricting the analy-
sis to Hispanic students (Table 4). The estimated dif-
ferences between California and other states in at-
school intake were slightly larger than those for the full
sample prior to adjusting for total caloric intake. As with
the full sample, though, results were virtually elimi-
nated after adjustment. The results for total intake among
Hispanic students (not shown) were also similar to the
results in Table 2, as Hispanic students in California con-
sumed only 20.1% of their total calories within school.
The fixed-effect analysis suggested that California stu-
dentsdidnotcompensateforconsuminglesswithinschool
by consuming more elsewhere. We found no evidence that
California students consumed more outside school on
weekdays, relative to weekends, than students in other
states did. The average within-student difference in week-
day vs weekend intake at home and other locations was
approximatelyequalinCaliforniavsotherstatesforallmea-
sures that we examined (results not shown).
COMMENT
In previous research on California's competitive food laws,
Woodward-Lopez et al described the laws as "an effec-
tive first step"18 while cautioning that the public health
impact may be limited without more comprehensive ini-
tiatives. Their conclusions were based on analyses of
school environment measures and a survey of select food
items administered only among California students. We

complemented their research by comparing detailed nu-
trient intake data in an independent sample of students
in California vs states with no laws regarding competi-
tive food nutrition content, and we similarly conclude
that California's laws have been successful in certain re-
spects but that their limitations should be highlighted as
school districts begin to implement competitive food nu-
trition standards as part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids
Act of 2010.
Unequivocally, California students in this study re-
ported less at-school intake of fat, sugar, and total calo-
ries--the nutrition measures that California laws were
designed to regulate--compared with other states in our
sample. Reported intake of these measures was lower in
California in the overall sample and specifically among
Hispanic students. The reductions among Hispanic stu-
dents are particularly encouraging given the high preva-
lence of youth obesity among Hispanic individuals in Cali-
fornia29 and the United States overall.30 It is also
encouraging in light of research that documented the high
presence of convenience stores, mobile food vendors, and
other food outlets surrounding schools in Hispanic com-
munities,31,32 including one study of a predominantly His-
panic school district in California.31 Estimated differ-
ences were in fact greater among Hispanic students than
among the overall sample, and one could argue that the
internal validity of results is greater when analyzing this
subgroup because of the substantial racial/ethnic differ-
ences between our comparison groups.
California students also reported lower at-school in-
take of several vitamins and minerals, and all differ-
ences in nutrient intake were eliminated after adjusting
for total caloric intake. This suggests that the nutrition
composition of California students' in-school diet was
similar to that of students in other states even if they con-
sumed less. The lack of difference in overall nutrition qual-
ity is not surprising given the following: (1) California's
competitive food laws limit fats, sugars, and calories but
do not require vegetables, whole grains, and other foods
that are compliant with the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans33; and (2) Woodward-Lopez et al18 reported that
many California schools complied with competitive food
laws by offering items such as baked chips that were tech-
nically compliant but had limited nutrition value. This
does not take away from the fact that California stu-
dents in this study consumed fewer calories in school,
which suggests that competitive food standards may be
a method of reducing adolescent weight gain. Yet, to im-
prove students' overall nutrient intake, policy makers may
need to promote more stringent competitive food regu-

lations that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans and do not merely ban junk food.
Overall, students in the sample consumed less than
one-third of their total calories at school. Larger studies
have reported similar estimates of the proportion of total
caloric intake that comes from at-school consump-
tion.34,35 On average, California students consumed an
even lower proportion of their calories at school and con-
sequently had an only slightly lower overall intake of
sugar, fat, and calories than students in other states. The
fixed-effect analysis indicated that California students re-
lied on other sources more in general, not owing to dif-
ferences in their school food environment. Regardless,
as Woodward-Lopez et al18 and other experts36 have ar-
gued, the low proportion of at-school intake suggests that
school-based policy initiatives are a starting point but must
be complemented with nutrition education and policy
changes in other sectors to improve the overall health of
the adolescent population.
California may differ from other states in its educa-
tional system and other school nutrition policies that could
account for differences in intake or lack thereof. This limi-
tation is heightened by the cross-sectional design, which
precludes us from concluding that California's laws were
the cause of any differences in intake. Our study was also
limited by the reliance on self-reported measures; al-
though 24-hour recall is a common measure of diet, chil-
dren are known to underreport their intake.37 Students
in our study sample generally reported less intake than
larger studies have reported, although the distribution
of calories between fats, carbohydrates, and proteins was
similar.38 Lower intake in our study sample may also be
attributable to self-selection bias. The 24-hour recall
sample represented a small proportion of the full NYPANS
sample, and students who consented to the recall may
have had less average consumption.
It should also be reiterated that the NYPANS sample
was not designed to represent individual states. The large
proportion of Hispanic students in the California sample
illustrates that the sample was not representative of Cali-
fornia. The evidence from this study is inconclusive be-
cause of these limitations, although there is sufficient evi-
dence to support the development of larger studies that
collect nutrient intake from a more representative sample.
Future studies should also include data on socioeco-
nomic status, a key covariate for which we were unable
to control.
One should assess this as a study of California's spe-
cific standards, not as a reflection of competitive food regu-
lations in general. California's competitive food stan-
dards are more strict than those of most states, but some
of California's standards for high schools in 2009-2010
remained lower than the standards recommended by the
Institute of Medicine.9 California did not regulate so-
dium content, for example, and had a higher caloric limit
for individual food items (250 calories) than the limit rec-
ommended by the Institute of Medicine (200 calories).
Interestingly, California's laws regarding sugar content
for competitive foods in high school in 2009-2010 were
equal to the standards set by the Institute of Medicine;
the relative stringency of sugar content policies may ex-
plain why sugar intake was the dietary measure for which
we found the strongest evidence of lower consumption
in California. Policy makers should look to standards set
by the Institute of Medicine and Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, and consider how to incorporate policy
changes in other sectors, to enhance the potential for
school changes to improve adolescents' overall diet.
