Introduction
Nineteenth-century alienists were forerunners to psychiatrists--
physicians who devoted themselves especially to the under-
standingandtreatmentofinsanity.Theinsanewereconsidered
withdrawn (alienated) from their normal faculties (Tuke,
1892). For the alienists, insanity was a discrete medical entity
including a definition, classification, diagnostic symptoms,
causes, duration, prognosis, and treatment (Bucknill & Tuke,
1858; Esquirol, 1845; Prichard, 1837/1973; Tighe, 2005).
The diagnosis and management of insanity required special
training that could be achieved only in asylums (Eigen,
1995; Mohr, 1993). The "medical jurisprudence of insanity"
was a major field of interest for the early alienists who
emerged during the first decades of that century (Zilboorg,
1944). As ample experience with insane inmates admitted
to the proliferating lunatic asylums accumulated, men like
Haslam (Zilboorg, 1944), Georget (Goldstein, 1987), Prichard
(1837/1973),Ray(1838/1962),vonFeuchtersleben(1845/1976),
and Winslow (1854) were eager to offer their opinions in judi-
cial proceedings involving insanity (Ray, 1839). These alien-
ists, claiming expertise different from other physicians and
laymen, offered themselves as medico-legal witnesses who
have directed their attention almost exclusively to the
study of medical psychology, and who, by patient
investigation and long experience, have obtained a
practical insight into the characteristics of the varied
phenomena of mental alienation, the habits and pecu-
liarities of the insane (Ray, 1839, p. 86)
and are therefore able to supply the courts "information as
to the nature of those causes on which unsoundness of mind
depends as to their extent and duration, their distinguishing
character, and ultimate results" (Prichard 1837/1973, p. 252).
The history of the jurisprudence of mental medicine of that
era is the controversial account of the successes and failures
encountered while trying to bring to the attention of the courts
theory and experience that converged into special knowledge,
mostly in criminal cases (Eigen, 1995; Mohr 1993).
However, "insanity considered in its civil relations"
(Zilboorg, 1944, p. 523; e.g., the capacity of an insane person
to manage his own affairs or the state of mind necessary to
constitute a valid will) was also a topic of great interest to the
early alienists and assumed a prominent position in the clas-
sification of the "different forms in which insanity becomes
the subject of legal investigation" (Coventry, 1844, p. 134).

A Narrow Definition of Insanity
Opined by Medical Experts in
the Oliver Smith Will Case in 1847
Jeremia Heinik1,2 and Kenneth I. Shulman3,4
Abstract
Physicians specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of insane people (alienists) emerged in the early 19th century and
offered their expertise for the courts to consider in judgments of mental competence. In the Oliver Smith will case (1847),
the competency of an attesting witness was contested on the issue of insanity. Four well-known alienists testified at trial.
Although the insanity of the witness could have been viewed in broader terms, the experts used a narrow definition of
insanity based primarily on the presence of delusions.These opinions were only partially consistent with contemporaneous
medical notions of insanity and the broad definition of criminal responsibility.We suggest three explanatory factors for the
narrow definition related to available medical knowledge, courtroom restrictions including the case itself, and mid-19th-
century relationships between mental medicine and the law.

A central place among the civil issues was occupied by
will contests. Testamentary litigation was generally believed
to be on the rise in the 19th century as reflected in the textual
analysis of contemporary law reports, treatises, and medico-
legal literature (Blumenthal, 2006; e.g., the American Journal
of Insanity, a predecessor of the American Journal of
Psychiatry, published at least seven "will cases" during the
first decades of publication beginning in 1844); however,
exact numbers need yet to be studied (Eigen, 2006). In an era
where capacity of self-government was presumed for all, the
bounds of testamentary freedom (absolute liberty of the testa-
tor vs. the domestic rights of his family) were debated
(Blumenthal, 2006). In legal practice, the extent of the liberty
of testation would hinge on the legal meanings of a "sound
and disposing mind and memory" (Blumenthal, 2006). It was
exactly this niche, comprising cases of "unnatural" or deviant
wills that attracted the interest of the early alienists. As scien-
tific experts, they could opine on the observable manifesta-
tions of insanity, capable of drawing the line between insanity
and mere eccentricity, but also demonstrated a "palpable
curiosity regarding the motives that animated the eccentric,
the singular, and the socially--if not mentally--irrational"
(Eigen, 2006, p. 236).
The Oliver Smith will case (1847) offers an opportunity
to examine the practical application of the theoretical basis
of insanity in a civil case. A newspaper article, "The Case of
Oliver Smith's Will" (Anonymous, 1847) and a short book
by attorney James W. Boyden (1847 [HeinOnline 2008])
were the first reports of the case. The book provides a com-
prehensive account, including a biography of Oliver Smith,
a copy of his will, and the proceedings in the Probate Court.
They were followed by an article titled "AWill Contest on the
Grounds of the Insanity of One of the Attesting Witnesses,"
running title "Oliver Smith's Will" (Anonymous, 1848), the
second account of a will contest published in the American
Journal of Insanity (henceforth, the Journal), preceded only
by a translated abstract of a French will case (T. R. B, 1846).
The anonymous author of the report might have beenAmariah
Brigham, the Journal founder and first editor, who wrote
many of the articles that appeared in the earliest volumes
(Brigham, 1833,1973). Brigham acknowledged the Hampshire
Gazette for the report of the trial, of which only a substance
(italics in original) of the testimony was included. He was
also one of the experts involved at the trial.
Based on these, other sources (Amherst College, 1927;
Anonymous, 1899, 1907, 1939), and personal communica-
tions, we introduce Oliver Smith, his will, the attacks to the
will, and the participants at the trial. We describe the men-
tal malady of the attesting witness, and the medical experts'
testimonies and opinions, followed by a brief summary
of the lawyers' arguments and the verdict, and then com-
pare the experts' testimonies with contemporaneous medi-
cal notions of insanity including their own published works
on that subject.
Oliver Smith: The Man and His Will
Oliver Smith of Hatfield, Massachusetts, farmer and
tradesman, died a bachelor in 1845 at the age of nearly
80 (Anonymous, 1847, 1848, 1907, 1939; Boyden, 1847
[HeinOnline 2008]). He was the youngest of six brothers, all
deceased before him; his father died when he was 1 year old,
and he was raised by his mother. Having a very limited for-
mal education, at the age of 21 he took his share in the
patrimony, in land, at the value of US$500. In course of
time, being an industrious, hard working man, who made
good investments as well as other successful financial deci-
sions, while spending little (Sttebins, 1898), he accumulated
a significant fortune.
Oliver Smith was a charitable man, directing his assistance
toward poor young women, the building of school houses in
poordistrictsofhisnativetown,andtheAmericanColonization
Society. Given his personal history, and because "his kindred
were in good circumstances" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 8), it was anticipated that the "bulk of his estate
should be applied to public uses" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 8). And so it was.
As early as 1832, with the aid of a local judge, a draft of
the first will was prepared, and completed the same year by
Charles P. Phelps, a successful lawyer of nearby Hadley.
Various codicils were added from year to year, reflecting the
fluctuations in the value of his property. Accordingly, the
number of the beneficiary towns varied from 8 to 12, and
"some individual legacies were occasionally inserted, or
omitted"(Boyden,1847[HeinOnline2008],p.8).Eventually,
Charles P. Phelps prepared another will, which was executed
on July 15, 1844. A codicil was added on the 13th of August,
1845, with further specifications on how to invest the funds,
however without changing the will's beneficiaries. In his
final will, a detailed and thoughtful document, Oliver Smith
nominated Austin Smith, a nephew ("a shrewd man of busi-
ness, honest, keen, and clear in his dealings"; Sttebins, 1898,
p. 174), as executor to the will, and for his past and future
services was given the testators' homestead in Hatfield. Ten
other relatives were given mostly small annuities. The major
bulk of the estate, around US$400,000 (a large sum of
money, but comparable with other "will cases" reported in
the Journal), was left for the establishment of an agricultural
schoolinNorthampton,forusebytheAmericanColonization
Society, and especially for the use and benefit of indigent
boys, girls, young women and widows, and residents of
several local towns. The attesting witnesses on both occa-
sions included Charles P. Phelps and his sons Charles and
Theophilus Parsons.
Attacks to the Will
Oliver Smith's heirs-at-law (16 in number excluding the
executor, all of them nephews and nieces, husbands included
Heinik and Shulman 3
whenever married) were "aggrieved" (Boyden, 1847
[HeinOnline 2008], p. 59). Some of them were probably
included in the preceding will or codicils and now excluded.
Others, although included in the last will, were disappointed
at the relatively small bequests appointed. All of them thought
"it was natural that those, who had lived around him for fifty
years, his relations by blood, should expect from their uncle,
a bachelor, at least some token of his remembrance" (Boyden,
1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 29). All of them were ready at
any time to stop legal proceedings "had he (the executor)
seen fit to divide between them and the devisees" (Boyden,
1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 30; 19th century will contests as
already indicated were usually fought on similar grounds;
Blumenthal, 2006).
At the Probate Court held at Northampton in March 1846,
the executor to the will expressed his willingness to execute
the trust, supported by Osmyn Baker, a lawyer appearing on
behalf of six of the beneficiary towns. Charles P. Huntington
on behalf of the heirs-at-law opposed the Probate of said
will, and objected the jurisdiction of Judge Conkey as Judge
of Probate on account of interest (his town of residence was
mentioned in the will). The latter claim was subsequently
declined, and in December 1846, Judge Conkey approved the
will and codicil.
Shortly thereafter, Smith's heirs-at-law filed a probate
appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) claiming that
(a) Oliver Smith was not of "sound and disposing mind and
memory" at the time of the execution of the will and codicil
and (b) the will and codicil were not "attested and sub-
scribed in the presence of the testator by three competent
witnesses;--competent at the time of attestation" (Boyden,
1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 2).
The first claim was dropped (Smith's neighbors "promptly
testified they had never known a more sensible, saner man";
Anonymous, 1907), and it was agreed by all that the testator
was of sound mind. Hence, the parties went to trial on the for-
mal objection that one of the attesting witnesses, Theophilus
Parsons, was incompetent on account of insanity. Idiots
("those who have no intellect, whether from birth or occa-
sioned by subsequent cause"; Walker, 1860, p. 264), lunatics
("those who have intellect but in a deranged state. There
need not be frenzy or raving madness, but only derangement
greater or less of the reasoning faculties. And here the true
criteria is delusion"; Walker, 1860, p. 264), infants, and those
on the ground of interest or infamy were incompetent to tes-
tify according to American law (Walker, 1860) of the time.
Thus, Theophilus was dragged into the plot by the heirs-
at-law legal tactics whose "case was not too strong" (Fuess,
1928, p. 149). There seemed to be only one point at which
an attack could offer any chance of success. "One of the
witnesses to the will had lived so secluded from society and
had conducted himself so singularly that he was reputed to
be insane" (Fuess, 1928, p. 149). The decisive evidence was
based on the fact that 11 months before the will was made, the
witnesswasdeclaredinsanebyDr.Woodward,Superintendent
of the Worcester State Asylum (Anonymous, 1847, 1848;
Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]; Brown, 1862).
The Participants at theTrial
Judge Wilde of the SJC for the County of Hampshire presided
at the trial, in front of a crowded courtroom, at Northampton,
Massachusetts, for three consecutive days beginning July 6,
1847 (Anonymous, 1847, 1848; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008]). Rufus Choate, R. A. Chapman, and C. P. Huntington
represented the heirs-at-law, while Daniel Webster, C. E.
Forbes, and Osmyn Baker represented the executor. Choate
(Brown, 1862; Fuess, 1928) and Webster (Remini, 1997)
were two of the most prominent lawyers of the time. Witnesses
included the father, the brothers, and Theophilus himself (evi-
dently considered competent by the court to testify at the time
of the trial), as well as 13 or 14 laymen and nonexpert physi-
cians. Four asylum superintendents were called as experts,
all of them formed part of the group of the "thirteen origi-
nals" of American psychiatry (Overholser, 1944): Samuel B.
Woodward (1787-1850), first president of the "Association
of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for
the Insane" (henceforth, the "Association"; forerunner of
the American Psychiatric Association; Overholser, 1944);
Amariah Brigham (1798-1849), founder and first editor of
the Journal; Isaac Ray (1807-1881), pioneer and founder of
the field of medical jurisprudence of insanity in America
(Zilboorg,1944);andLutherV.Bell(1806-1867).Woodward,
who examined Theophilus about 4 years before the trial, was
also heard as a witness.
Theophilus's Mental Malady
Theophilus was born in Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1821
(Anonymous, 1847, 1848, 1899; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008]). His mother was the daughter of famous Chief Justice
Theophilus Parsons of the Massachusetts State Bench. He
prepared for college at local schools and in 1837 went to
Amherst College. The descriptions and opinions concerning
Theophilus made by the objecting and proponent witnesses
evidently were not concordant (Anonymous, 1847, 1848;
Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]). However, the points
of agreement and other available data permit a coherent
account. Theophilus, a rather reserved and shy boy, was not
fond of company and changed conspicuously during his last
year of college. He was in poor health (dyspepsia, pain in the
head), generally depressed, and even more asocial. His phy-
sician told him the complaints were of nervous character.
Consequently, he left college in the summer term of his junior
year and the last part of his senior year, and did not complete
his requisite assignments for commencement. Nevertheless,
being a good student, he eventually graduated college in 1841.
Thereafter, considering himself physically disqualified from
4 SAGE Open
pursuing a profession, he lived at home working on the family
farm. Although not usually at the dinner table when company
was present, he could discuss freely many subjects and was
a voracious reader. In the summer of 1843, he told his uncle
that he experienced peculiar feelings, extraordinary eleva-
tions of spirits and fullness about the head. Another uncle
(a reverend), who met him on July 1, 1843, thought he
was under "high religious excitement" (Anonymous, 1848,
p. 231), confessing to taking pears from a tree near the road
when 10 or 12 years old. In August of the same year, shortly
after his father broke a thigh in an accident, Theophilus
started to claim that some people, including his brother,
intended to injure him, and he was in a state of nervous
excitability. He became reluctant to enter the nearby woods,
locked the windows during the day, and got up at night to see
if there were people around.
In this state, he was advised by his father to go to Worcester
Asylum, accompanied by another brother. Woodward
described him on August 1843 as follows:
Theophilus was still and silent, answering only in
monosyllables. . . . I found his health poor. . . . com-
plained of dyspeptic symptoms, of uncomfortable
feelings in his head, not exactly headache, but an
oppression. . . . at times, he seemed anxious, walked
about the room, looked out of the windows and doors,
and admitted his apprehension that some one was in
pursuit of him. He said, that he was afraid that people
would dissect him, that there was a conspiracy, that
individuals were about the house, suspected of evil
intentions, and . . . suspected a brother of being in
conspiracy. While I was conversing with [brother],
Theophilus came to me, walking rapidly, and asked,
"Doctor, do you think me a pig?" I thought this totally
disconnected with anything said previous. . . . I asked
him why he said so. He replied that it occurred to him,
at that moment, that I thought so. (Boyden, 1847
[HeinOnline 2008], p. 19-20)
Woodward, thinking it would be better for Theophilus to
stay at home, rather than in the asylum with "other eighteen
insane persons in room" (Boyden, 1847 [HeineOnline 2008],
p. 25) apparently in worthier conditions, prescribed for
Theophilus, who was not better. On Sabbath, after his
return, under some delusion and in a state of excitement,
"he threw himself into the water" (Anonymous, 1848,
p. 229), probably trying to "drown himself in the river"
(Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 27). It seems that
within several months, a change for the better took place.
According to Theophilus, he was more rational and had no
fears or delusions anymore. His mind, however, had been
somewhat more depressed since then, and he more frequently
avoided company. In Spring 1844, he wrote a history of the
Five Books of Moses for Sabbath School that was accepted by
the Committee of Publication. In the following years, he
continued to read new books, occasionally wrote short pieces,
and managed his "little gains" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 16) from the farm.
At the time of the execution of the will (July 1844),
Theophilus said, his "bodily health was not much improved,"
but his mind "was good" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 15).
At trial, Theophilus's testimony "was given with remark-
able clearness and precision. He gave a minute and lucid
account of the transaction of attesting the will, relating
some circumstances which the other witnesses had omitted"
(Anonymous, 1848, p. 228).
We know little about Theophilus following the trial in which
his sanity, at least in the eyes of some, was "fully established"
(Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 5). Of his class atAmherst
College, he was the only one not to pursue a career and one of
few not married (Amherst College, 1927; Anonymous, 1899).
He was not mentioned either in his father's extensive autobiog-
raphy of 1855, nor in his correspondence with family (P. Nelson,
personal communication, June 2007). During almost his entire
life, he was more or less considered an invalid, and for several
years was unable to go out of doors. Most of his life passed at
Hadley quietly and uneventfully. His final illness (apoplexy)
wasashortone,andhediedattheageof77atAmherst(Amherst
College, 1927; Anonymous, 1899).
Medical Expert
Testimonies and Opinions
The experts were asked if Theophilus was insane (idiot or
lunatic; Walker, 1860) on July 15, 1844, and consequently
incompetent to attest the will (Brown, 1862). All four agreed
that Theophilus was insane in August 1843. However, the
crucial date was neither August 1843 nor July 1847, when
the experts were able to observe but not examine him.
Therefore, the legal question dictated that those contesting
the will would claim that insanity was present in July 1844,
by trying to expand its scope, whereas the parties supporting
the will would try to limit its definition, or deny its existence.
This becomes apparent in the lawyers'arguments to the court
to be summarized in the next section. Thus, the experts were
interrogated as to presence of insanity, its characteristics,
duration, causation, relationship to peculiarities of behavior,
competence at daily activities, body complaints, not to men-
tion their opinion concerning Theophilus's reliability at trial
and his competency at the crucial legal time.
Woodward thought Theophilus was ill during the 2 years
preceding their first meeting. At Worcester, the alienist was
certain that Theophilus suffered from at least one delusion
and was influenced by it, and that this was a form of insanity,
insane melancholy different from hypochondriasis. He was
not impressed by Theophilus's literary and work accom-
plishments claiming that many insane persons write coher-
ent letters, essays, poetry, or even books. Avoiding society,
he proclaimed, was not necessarily the effect of delusion.
Heinik and Shulman 5
Woodward was convinced that Theophilus's condition was
caused by hard study­induced dyspepsia that produced a
morbid condition of the brain and nervous system, that is,
insanity. He saw no evidence of delusions in 1844, maybe
due to a lucid interval. Woodward argued that insanity is not
always dependent on the delusion. Rather, because the dys-
pepsia that caused the "aberration of mind" (Anonymous,
1848, p. 233) existed in 1844, he was insane, and therefore
not legally responsible.
Brigham thought Theophilus was insane at Worcester in
1843, and that his delusions and attempt to drown himself
in the river after his return from Worcester confirmed the
presence of insanity. He regarded his "religious revivals"
(Anonymous, 1848, p. 234; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 26) a reflection of a developing insanity, but was
less convinced that Theophilus's dyspepsia, headache, shy-
ness, or writing an essay, caused or perpetuated his insanity.
He noticed that dyspepsia very frequently precedes, but gen-
erally subsides, at the commencement of insanity and that
there is very little headache in the insane. He mentioned, as a
general fact, that when the minds of the insane recover, their
bodies recover, although their minds are sometimes relieved
before they recover their bodily health. Brigham was not
impressed by Theophilus's literary activities and indicated
that an insane person could still write a book, unless there is
"general insanity" (Anonymous, 1848, p. 234; Boyden, 1847
[HeinOnline 2008], p. 27). He was impressed byTheophilus's
account of his recovery and concluded that there was no evi-
dence for insanity in 1844.
Ray, similarly impressed by Theophilus's testimony,
found his frank and open account the strongest proof of his
mental stability. He agreed that there were delusions for a
limited time in 1843; however, they were no longer present
in 1844. He claimed that those delusions were the only proof
of insanity in 1843. Nothing further indicative of insanity
was observed. Consequently, Ray said that Theophilus was
perfectly competent to attest the will in 1844.
Bell, in agreement with the other experts, had no doubt
concerning Theophilus's insanity at Worcester, in 1843; how-
ever, he presumed that it gradually disappeared in 2 to 3 months.
Headache was not an essential component of insanity, and
thus it was concluded that Theophilus was capable to attest
the will, in July 1844.
A Brief Summary of the
Lawyers' Arguments, the
Verdict, and Epilogue
Choate raised an expanded and comprehensive account
concerning Theophilus's insanity, which, rhetoric excluded,
might seem derived from a contemporaneous textbook
on insanity, whereas Webster argued for a limited one
(Anonymous, 1847, 1848; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]).
According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, a change in personality
started when Theophilus went to college, in the end of the 3rd
or the beginning of the 4th year; this culminated into manifest
insanity during the summer of 1843, when he was "not mad for
the first time, but differently mad" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 31). Because no "restoration" had been proven, in
July 15, 1844, Theophilus was "there present; but . . . his
mind was not there; he was brooding over some delusion"
(Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 32), hence unable to
"try the testators' mind" and to "protect" him (Boyden,
1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 31), and therefore was, accord-
ing to his interpretation of the law, an incompetent witness.
For Webster, the case turned a good deal on the "character
of a young man" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 33),
and if insanity has been proved, then it might be "temporary or
coming and going" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 35),
or curable. Moreover, even if there was insanity, then much
would depend on its degree.According to Webster, in mid-July
1844, Theophilus was intelligent, and understood the nature
of an oath, and therefore was credible (competent) to testify in
a case of assault or battery. Consequently, he concluded that
"a competent witness in a court of law is a competent wit-
ness to a will" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 34).
Judge Wilde, while charging the jury, reminded them that
the issue before them was whether Theophilus was a com-
petent or credible witness. He identified principle elements
of competency as absence of interest, infamy, and imbecility
of mind. The judge commented at length on the evidence of
the "mental capacity" of Theophilus and concluded that "if
the jury believed that he might have been admitted to testify
in court immediately after attesting the will, he was a com-
petent witness within the statue" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 36). Subsequently, at the third ballot, the jury was
"unanimous in favor of establishing the will" (Boyden,
1847 [HeinOnline 2008], p. 36). This concurred with the
December 1846 ruling of Judge Conkey. In August 1847,
Judge Conkey ruled that the validity of the will had been
established and appointed Austin Smith executor of the will
(Anonymous, 1939).
Thereafter, the Smith Charities were founded (Ebbeling,
1976). When Austin died, unmarried, in 1861, his estate of
US$450,000 was bequeathed to his sister Sophia. Sophia
Smith bequeathed her fortune in 1870 for the establishment
of Smith College for Women at Northampton (Sttebins,
1898). She was one of the heirs-at-law opposing Oliver
Smiths's will (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]).
The Medical Expert Testimonies
in Light of Contemporaneous
Notions of Insanity
In the middle of the 19th century, a considerable amount of
knowledge had accumulated in Europe regarding insanity
and was made available to American alienists in textbooks,
periodicals, and by personal visits. By 1847, the 3-year-old
6 SAGE Open
"Association" had its third annual meeting that provided a
forum for the exchange of ideas. The proceedings were pub-
lished regularly in the Journal, the first periodical in the
English language to be devoted exclusively to psychological
medicine (Overholser, 1944), that also published both trans-
lated and original articles by European authors and reported
news from Europe. Rush's textbook of 1812, Ray's "Treatise"
of 1838, and "lesser volumes" (Bunker, 1944) were already
published. The alienists who participated in the trial were
actively involved in the formation of American mental
medicine. They all contributed to the literature and debate on
insanity. With the exception of Woodward, all had visited
the institutions for the insane in Europe, and all were inspired
by French and English alienists (Overholser, 1944). The
American view of insanity was therefore very similar if not
identical to the European perceptions (Dain, 1964).
Definition of insanity. Nineteenth-century writings reflected
a very broad definition of the faculties impaired in insanity
(Esquirol, 1845; Prichard, 1837/1973; Winslow, 1854).
"Definition of Insanity--Nature of the Disease," published
in the first volume of the Journal, most probably by Brigham,
described "a chronic disease of the brain, producing either
derangement of the intellectual faculties or prolonged change
of the feelings, affections, and habits of an individual"
(Anonymous, 1844, p. 97). Thus, this wide ranging defini-
tion of insanity, departing from overt delusions and frenzied
behavior, was inherently problematic (Bucknill & Tuke, 1858;
Prichard, 1837/1973; Ray, 1838/1962; Winslow, 1854;
"insanity belongs to a class of phenomena that may be
described and explained, but are not the proper object of a
definition"; Ray, 1871/1976, p. 631), especially in a medico-
legal setting where lawyers would ask for a definition of
insanity to confound and discredit the expert witness (Ray,
1838/1962, 1839; Winslow, 1854). We therefore presume that
the four alienists would avoid defining insanity as much
as possible. The text itself does not refer to definitions
(Anonymous, 1847, 1848; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]).
Classification of insanity and diagnosis. Classifications were
abundant and varied (Bucknill & Tuke, 1858; Esquirol, 1845;
Prichard, 1837/1973; Ray, 1838/1962, 1839). Ray's (1839)
comprehensive classification of insanity was similar to the
one adopted by Esquirol (lypemania/melancholy, monoma-
nia, mania, dementia, imbecility/idiocy). In his "Treatise," he
maintained,
A natural classification of the various forms of
insanity . . . will be of eminent service to the legal
inquirer . . . The deplorable consequences of knowing
but one kind of insanity, and of erecting that into a
standard, whereby every other is to be compared and
tested, are too common in the records of criminal juris-
prudence. (Ray, 1838/1962, p. 59)
After Pinel, Woodward (Grob, 1962) divided insanity into
mania, melancholia, and dementia. Each existed in chronic
and acute forms. Brigham and Bell as well used a symptom-
atological classification, although the latter had his reserva-
tions and suggested an etiological classification (Bucknill &
Tuke, 1879).
It is remarkable that only Woodward presented a specific
diagnosis (insane melancholy) beyond the general label of
insanity. One does not know if any other diagnosis was
ascribed to Theophilus by the other alienists involved.
Diagnostic symptoms. Analyzing symptoms that characterize
insanity was considered fundamental (Ray, 1839). In addi-
tion to disorders of sensibility, understanding, intelligence
and will, change in habits, tastes, and passions, which could
appear a long time before an individual was regarded as
insane, were important diagnostic elements (Esquirol, 1845).
For Ray a change of character was a proof of insanity (Ray,
1839), a view sustained over the next decades (Bucknill &
Tuke, 1879).
The mental phenomena demonstrated by Theophilus could
be subdivided into delusions and nondelusions (e.g., change
of disposition and habits, depression/melancholy, behavioral,
etc.). It is remarkable that only the overt delusions expressed
by Theophilus were considered central indicators of insanity
by all four experts. Other morbid phenomena were not men-
tioned, or mentioned only in conjunction with a delusion
(e.g., the attempt to drown himself in water), or considered
nonspecific (e.g., headache as a good explanation for avoid-
ing company).
Causes of insanity. Esquirol (1845) divided causes of insan-
ity into general or special, physical or moral, primitive or sec-
ondary,andpredisposingorexciting.Hereditarypredisposition
as well as ill health, dyspepsia, and application to study ranked
high in physical and moral causes of insanity based on Ameri-
can asylum data (Earle, 1848).
"Dyspepsia-hereditary" (Anonymous, 1848, p. 232) in
three generations was mentioned at trial by Dr. Gridley, one
of the nonexpert physicians involved (Anonymous, 1848;
Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]). Theophilus's father was
a noted hypochondriac and Theophilus Parsons, the grandfa-
ther, was regarded as the "hypochondriacal Chief Justice"
(Fuess, 1928, p. 149). We would suggest considering these
remarks somewhat humorously, presumably made by the
defendants, as the reputation of being a hypochondriac was
not associated with insanity in either case.
Brigham (1833/1973) published on the association between
moral causes, body ailments, and insanity. He theorized that
prolonged moral causes continuously irritate the brain, fol-
lowed by dyspepsia and insanity. At trial, however, he tried
to diminish the causative role for dyspepsia and headache
in this case. Woodward suggested hard study as a cause for
Theophilus's dyspepsia. However, as the evidence showed,
Theophilus had dyspepsia and headaches before, during, and
after the summer of 1843, long after he graduated college.
Neither Theophilus himself nor any of the alienists attributed
much importance to his father's accident; consequently, it was
not considered a "shock" or a moral cause.
Heinik and Shulman 7
Duration of insanity. All alienists of the time agreed that the
duration of insanity is variable (Prichard, 1837/1973). The
duration of the disease in cases terminating favorably was
considered by Pinel to range from 5 to 6 months and by
Esquirol and Tuke to be as long as 1 year (Bucknill & Tuke,
1879). Associated with duration was the idea of "incubation"
of insanity that was developed by French alienists in the first
third of the 19th century for clinical and forensic reasons
(Esquirol, 1845; Martinez Perez, 1993). Ray (1839) was also
cognizant of the state preceding insanity and seemed to have
adopted Pinel and Georget's opinions on incubation of men-
tal alienation during which the true state of the patient is
generally misunderstood, or not appreciated and may last
for a long time.
The medical opinions at trial varied on the duration of
Theophilus's delusions. The shortest notion (Bell) considered
it to have continued for 2 or 3 months. Ray referred to its
existence in 1843 but not 1844. Brigham and Woodward were
of a similar opinion. Theophilus himself said the delusions
terminated in winter. If it was winter (January, February),
then the duration of the delusions was 6 to 7 months.
From a broader medical point of view, the question was
not purely whether there was a clear delusion in 1844, but if
there was evidence of insanity or other nondelusional morbid
phenomena in 1844. The medical experts were also interested
in the morbid phenomena that preceded August 1843 cover-
ing the period of "religious revival" (Anonymous, 1848,
p. 234; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008] p. 26), extraordinary
elevations of spirits and excitement, and changes of habits
and disposition described by some witnesses at the end of
college. Whether regarded as an incubation period, indic-
ative of approaching insanity, or as forming a part of a
broader definition of insanity, they surely indicate a period of
mental turmoil, distress, and morbidity, ranging from 1 month
to 2 years, preceding the delusional period, which Theophilus
experienced.
Course of insanity. Of the three possible outcomes of insan-
ity (remission, dementia, death; Prichard, 1837/1973), it was
evident that Theophilus was neither demented nor dead in
1844. He lived to an advanced age, which suggests that no
real malignant disorder underlined his physical complaints.
However, did Theophilus recover from his insanity in 1844?
Although a change for the better took place as Theophilus
stated that he was not afraid anymore (at trial, presumably
even in July 1844), he still was depressed a great deal of the
time. Theophilus himself mentioned that even if the delusion
concerning injuries by his brother and others passed in
the winter of 1844, he still considered his case to resemble
"hypochondriasis" (Anonymous, 1848, p. 229) and main-
tained those ideas concerning his physical health mentioned
at trial, presumably in July 1844. At that time, hypochondria-
siswasthoughtbymanytobeaformofinsanity(Anonymous,
1845b). Frequently melancholia and hypochondriasis alter-
nated complicated by suicide or terminated by mental
alienation (Galt, 1856). Both were considered maladies
(Esquirol, 1845). Therefore, Theophilus apparently would not
have met the criteria for a "diagnosis of recovery" (Bucknill &
Tuke, 1879, p. 479).
Prognosis. For Ray (1839) the circumstances favorable to
recovery included constitution, good moral and intellectual
education, hereditary predisposition for insanity, and early
medical treatment. Other factors favoring recovery would
be the occurrence of certain moral or physical impressions
(e.g., intense fright, attack of fever).
Were there factors that would predict favorable prognosis?
While good moral and intellectual education, lack of heredi-
tary predisposition for insanity (other than hypochondriasis/
dyspepsia), and absence of an exciting moral or physical
cause might be assumed as favorable circumstances, there are
doubts concerning the issues of constitution and appropriate
early treatment. Theophilus's frail constitution has already
been discussed. As for early treatment, he was subjected to
the prevailing home/community management, however not
exposed to the applauded asylum moral treatment (Moran,
1998). We know that he was prescribed leeching and bleed-
ing by Dr. Gridley in July 1843 and again after his return
from Worcester, but it might have been for the dyspepsia, as
Gridley saw nothing indicating insanity (Anonymous, 1847,
1848; Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008]). Woodward treated
Theophilus with medications at Worcester. He was consid-
ered an expert in therapy (Anonymous, 1844, 1845a) and
relied, perhaps too heavily, on opiates and stimulants as rem-
edies (Grob, 1962; McGovern, 1985). Gridley discontinued
Woodwards's "too stimulating" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline
2008], p. 24) prescriptions.
Discussion
The "Oliver Smith will case" turned on the legal competency
of one of the attesting witnesses to the will. The alienists
involved were primarily questioned as to his insanity at the
time of attestation. Based on the available material, we con-
clude that three out of the four alienists took a restricted view
of insanity, equating it with the presence of delusions. The
evidence, however, indicated that Theophilus experienced
morbid phenomena characteristic of insanity even before he
manifested delusions, and there were several indicators to
doubt his complete recovery from insanity in July 1844.
Woodward took a broader view. However, even for him, the
nondelusional phenomena were not crucial.
Present day practitioners have at their disposition a broad
definition of "mental disorder" ("a clinically significant
behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern";American
Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. xxi), under which catego-
ries, criteria, and textual descriptions are prescribed. As for
Theophilus, in modern eyes, a mental disorder consisting of
a prodromal period, followed by an active stage with promi-
nent delusions and terminating in a residual phase, would be
understood as probably belonging to the schizophrenia cate-
gory (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). However,
8 SAGE Open
the clinician is cautioned as to the use of the clinical diagnosis
in forensic settings where additional information beyond that
contained in the diagnosis is needed in determining "whether
an individual meets a specified legal standards" (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. xxiii).
Theoretically speaking, the trial represented an opportu-
nity for these influential alienists to present to the court all the
broad natural phenomena of insanity as reflected in this case,
and which formed part of a contemporaneous broad view of
insanity, especially vis-à-vis criminal responsibility (Weiss,
2007). Moreover, Ray (1838/1962), much ahead of his time,
advocated that incompetence to testify is not necessarily con-
nected with insanity. He felt it would be appropriate to con-
sider the former an independent fact to be established by a
distinct order of proofs.After the German jurist Hoffbauer, he
maintained that even a subject with lower degrees of imbecil-
ity, partial intellectual mania, or partial moral mania, and old
men in the early stages of dementia, under some restrictions,
can still testify if (a) senses are sufficiently sound to take cog-
nizance of the facts to which he testifies, (b) the impressions
are really what he believes they are, (c) testimony coincides
with his belief, and (d) he is able to convey to others his own
ideas without fear of being misinterpreted. These criteria
established a distinction between diagnosis and its symptoms
on one hand and the capacities necessary for the appropriate
completion of a specific legal task on the other hand.
Consistent with Ray's reasoning, Theophilus could be broadly
defined as insane however still a competent witness.
Nonetheless, in this case, the experts gave primacy to the
existence of delusions, whose presence or absence tradition-
ally constituted the "true test" of insanity for legal purposes
(Tighe, 2005; Wetmore, 1864; Winslow, 1854). This stood in
contradiction with the prevailing tendency of the early alienists,
including their own views (Bucknill & Tuke, 1858; Esquirol,
1845; Prichard, 1837/1973; Ray, 1838/1962; Winslow, 1854),
in favor of a broad definition of insanity.
We suggest three explanatory sets of factors:
A. Available medical knowledge: The alienists thought
that this case represented a short-term insanity.
All the great alienists described cases of relatively
short episodes of insanity (Esquirol, 1845; Prichard,
1837/1973). In addition, not only was there a gen-
eral belief of a good prognosis for some recent cases
of insanity as the statistics of asylum admissions
and discharges demonstrated (Grob, 1962), but
socially, a "cult of curability" prevailed (Luchins,
1992). Alternatively, a more specific diagnosis other
than insanity was difficult to formulate. Theophi-
lus's case was more characteristic of lypemania/
melancholia (Woodward's diagnosis) according to
Esquirol. This suggested monomania according to
Prichard, and partial intellectual mania accord-
ing to Ray. The period preceding the confirmed
insanity and the one that followed it were difficult
to classify because the appropriate terminology and
concepts were still lacking (Berrios, 1996). In 1847,
the lack of a longitudinal view of disease (Berrios,
2007), clear concepts of personality and personality
disorders (Berrios, 1996) and recovery, would have
rendered a specific diagnosis difficult. Nevertheless,
they could have regarded Theophilus's eccentricity
a lifelong process complicated by insanity, a change
of character indicative of insanity, or insanity result-
ing in "imperfect recovery" (Ray, 1871/1976).
B. Courtroom restrictions and the case itself: The
medical men in the courtroom were subpoenaed
by the judge, the parties involved, and their attor-
neys (Eigen, 1995). In court, the medical expert can
be subjected to "yes" or "no" answers by experi-
enced lawyers. Thus, they would have preferred
to distinguish between solid clinical findings, the
so-called "pathognomonic signs" of insanity (delu-
sions; Mohr, 1993), as opposed to the theoretical
constructs. For example, when Woodward was pro-
ceeding to append remarks to one of his replies, he
was reminded that Webster did not want "a speech
on a question" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline 2008,
p. 21]). Theophilus's other symptoms did not con-
stitute decisive evidence for insanity. In fact, the
belief that dyspepsia was a form of insanity was
disputed (Brigham, 1833/1973), and not every-
one accepted that hypochondriasis was equivalent
to insanity and disease of the brain (Anonymous,
1846). Theory aside, Woodward (Grob, 1962) did
not find classifications of insanity useful in treat-
ing the disease as the various forms tended to blend
into one another, and Bell (Bucknill & Tuke, 1879)
abandoned his etiological classification. The alien-
ists were free within the judicial arena, to make up
their own minds and to pick and choose aspects of
theory that were consistent with their practice and
experience and appealed to them. They might not
have found the courtroom as the appropriate forum
to expand on "textbook" concepts and theories. The
convincing testimony offered by Theophilus himself
at trial might have served to strengthen this view.
C. Mid-19th-century relationship between mental med-
icine and the law: This period was a "golden era"
(Blumenthal, 2006; Tighe, 2005) in the relationship
between mental medicine and the law, although this
state of affairs would soon change (Mohr, 1993;
Tighe, 2005). Medical experts knew more about the
manifestations and varieties of mental illness. The
challenge was how the courts could be educated to
the levels of understanding of experts in mental ill-
ness (Mohr, 1993). Judges and lawyers were initially
receptive to these "scientific means of accounting"
(Blumenthal, 2006). There was a sense that they
"should and could share a definition of insanity,
Heinik and Shulman 9
if only they could clearly articulate how `the best'
practitioners of their respective professions under-
stood the concept" (Tighe, 2005, p. 254). All this
was presumably easier to achieve in civil cases such
as a will contest (Zilboorg, 1944), especially in an
uncomplicated case (short duration, small number
of witnesses) where the best practitioners on both
sides were involved, as was the "Oliver Smith will
case." Using a narrow definition, with a focus on
the presence or absence of delusions, would seem
a step in that direction of consensus on the con-
cept of "insanity" in mid-19th century. The medi-
cal discourse would have been different if the legal
question concerned Theophilus's criminal respon-
sibility, with its potentially serious consequences.
