ABSTRACT
Background: Australian adults reportedly have poor oral health when compared to 28 other OECD countries. The
Australian ranking was based on edentulism and caries experience data from selected age groups that apparently were
collected in 1987­88. The objective of this study was to compare the oral health of Australian adults with that of three other
western countries that have comprehensive oral health survey data.
Methods: Published data were obtained from the NHANES 2003­2004, the Fourth German Oral Health Study 2005 and
the UK Adult Dental Health Survey 1998. Data from the Australian NSAOH 2004­06 were analysed to generate
comparable age-specific estimates using nine dental clinical indicators, two measures of oral hygiene behaviour and two of
dental attendance.
Results: Australia had the best oral health based on two clinical indicators, was equal first on three indicators and ranked
second in the remaining clinical indicators. Australia ranked first or second based on dental flossing, use of mouthwash and
frequency of dental attendance.
Conclusions: The oral health of the Australian adult population was among the best of the four nations studied.
Key words: Dental health surveys, oral health, epidemiology.

INTRODUCTION
Comparisons of oral health and oral health behaviours
between industrialized countries give insight into how
successful, or otherwise, various countries are in pro-
moting oral health and providing dental care.
Findings from a database compiled by the Organisa-
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development1
(OECD) have been quoted suggesting that Australia's
oral health ranked 21 out of the 29 OECD countries.
The Australian ranking was based on edentulism and
caries experience data from selected age groups that
apparently were collected in the 1987­88 National
Oral Health Survey of Australia.2 The finding has been
used as an indicator of Australia's relatively poor adult
oral health in research papers3 and in Australia's
National Oral Health Plan 2004­2013.4 The OECD
finding indicated that Australia languished among
countries with the worst rate of edentulism.5 However,
recent data reveal that during the 17 years since the
1987­88 Australian survey, the percentage of edentu-
lous adults had more than halved, and decay experience
had halved in some age groups.6
Similarly, data from the US National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated
that oral health status had improved in the decade since
1988­1994.7 For seniors, edentulism and periodontitis
had declined; for adults, improvements were seen in
dental caries prevalence, tooth retention, and periodon-
tal health; and for adolescents and youths, dental
sealant prevalence had increased and dental caries had
decreased.
Likewise, in Germany from 1997 to 2005, there was
a decline in children's caries experience, a significant
reduction in tooth loss among adults and senior
citizens, a high degree of prosthetic dental care, and

an increase in the prevalence of severe periodontal
disease and root caries.8
Trends have also been noted over 10 years from the
UK Adult Dental Health Surveys. In the decade after
1988, the average number of sound teeth had increased,
there was no significant change in the average number
of decayed or unsound teeth, and little overall change in
the average number of restored teeth.9
National oral health surveys have been used to
monitor oral health status in many countries and
typically collect data on the clinical signs of dental
caries, tooth presence, periodontal health indices and
oral health behaviours. The 2004­06 Australian
National Survey of Adult Oral Health (NSAOH), and
published data from three other OECD countries,
provided a timely opportunity to compare the oral
health and oral health behaviours of adult Australians
with adults of the same age groups from the US,
Germany and the UK. The aim of this paper was to
compare the oral health of adult Australians with adults
in three other countries.
METHODS
Published data from three recent national oral health
surveys conducted in the United States of America,
Germany and the United Kingdom were compared
with Australian findings computed for comparable age
groups from the 2004­06 NSAOH. The NSAOH used
a clustered stratified random sampling design to select
a representative sample of people aged 15 years or
more. Survey participants were interviewed by tele-
phone and those who had one or more natural teeth
were asked to attend a nearby dental clinic where
standardized oral epidemiological examinations were
conducted by one of 30 dentist-examiners trained in the
survey methods. Of the 14 123 people interviewed,
5505 (43.7 per cent) were examined. Extensive analysis
was undertaken to investigate potential non-participa-
tion bias, with the results showing that the survey
underestimated some estimates of oral disease, although
the degree of underestimation was no more than three
percentage points for measures of prevalence. Full
details of sampling, examination protocol and survey
participation have been described elsewhere.10
Published data from the United States came from the
2003­2004 NHANES in which 28 661 participants
were interviewed in their homes;7 88.4 per cent
completed the oral health examination that was
conducted by dentist-examiners trained in the survey's
procedures.
The Fourth German Oral Health Study (OHS) was a
population-representative cross-sectional study held in
2005.8 Four age groups were examined: 12-year olds,
15-year olds, 35­44 year olds and 65­74 year olds.
Information was collected by a self-complete question-
naire and a clinical dental examination. A total of 4631
survey participants completed both the clinical dental
examination and sociological survey components of
the German OHS. The examination participation rate
was 63.1 per cent, but extensive non-response analysis
allowed an increase in the rate for core information to
72.6 per cent.
The UK Adult Dental Health Survey (ADHS) used a
stratified sampling design to select adults aged 16 years
and over living in the UK in 1998.9 It consisted of
a face-to-face interview to collect information on
the respondent's oral health behaviour, attitudes and
opinions; and for dentate respondents, a home dental
examination. Seventy-four per cent of all eligible
households agreed to take part in the 1998 UK ADHS,
and 92 per cent of the 6764 adults in these households
completed an interview. A total of 3817 of the 5281
interviewed dentate adults were clinically examined.
Comparisons were made using nine clinical indicators
of oral health status: the percentage of people who were
edentulous; the mean number of teeth present per person;
the percentage of people who had one or more decayed
teeth; the mean number of coronal decayed surfaces per
person; the percentage of people who had one or more
filled teeth; the mean number of coronal filled surfaces
per person; the percentage of people with a DMFT
(decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth) index
greater than zero; the percentage of people who had at
least one tooth with clinical attachment loss (CAL) of
4 mm or more; and the percentage of people with at least
one tooth with periodontal pocketing of greater than
4 mm. Four oral health behaviours were reported: the
percentage of people who flossed one or more times a
day; the percentage of people who used a mouthwash
once or more a day; the percentage of people who had
visited a dentist in the last 12 months; and the percentage
of people whose last dental visit dentist was five years ago
or more.
The Australian NSAOH data were used as a refer-
ence so that comparisons could be made between the
different age groups reported for the remaining three
countries. For example, after excluding the child and
adolescent age groups from the published results of the
Fourth German Oral Health Study, adults of ages 35­
44 and 65­74 years remained, so Australian estimates
were computed for the same age groups. The random
variability caused by the sampling was expressed by
computing 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the
Australian data and statistically significant differences
were made in comparison with the US, the only other
country to have reported 95% CIs. In those instances, a
difference was judged to be statistically significant if the
95% CIs did not overlap.
Statistical analyses of the Australian data were
performed using SAS/SUDAAN software (Version 9.1;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

RESULTS
Edentulism prevalence was negligible below the age of
35 years in all four countries. For other age groups,
Australians had the lowest prevalence of edentulism for
all comparisons except with US adults aged 75 years or
more. Within that age category, prevalence in Australia
exceeded the US by 4.4 per cent, though the difference
was not statistically significant (Table 1).
The mean number of missing teeth per person was
lower in Australia than in the UK and Germany
(Table 2). When compared with the UK, the greatest
relative difference was observed for 16­24 year olds
while the smallest difference was between people aged
65 years or more. When compared to the US, Austra-
lians had a lower mean number of missing teeth for age
groups under 50 years of age, and a higher mean
number of missing teeth for those 65 years of age or
older.
In all age groups with the exception of 35­44 year
olds, the percentage of people with one or more
decayed teeth was more than twice as high in the UK
compared to Australia (Table 3). Germany had a lower,
whilst the US had a similar, percentage of people with
one or more decayed teeth compared to Australia.
Australians up to the age of 65 years had a lower mean
number of coronal decayed surfaces when compared to
their counterparts of the same age in the US population,

and those members of the US population older than
65 years (Table 4). Australians also had a lower mean
number of coronal filled surfaces than their US counter-
parts under age 35 years and their German counterparts
in people of 35­44 years, but a higher mean number of
coronal filled surfaces with US citizens 35 or more years
and German citizens of 65­74 years.
US citizens had a lower percentage of people with
caries experience (DMFT of one or more) in all age
groups than Australians, whilst Germans had a simi-
lar percentage of people with caries experience to
Australians.
The US had the lowest percentage of people with
either clinical attachment loss of 4 mm or more, or with
periodontal pockets greater than 4 mm. With both
indicators, Germany had a greater percentage of people
with poorer periodontal health than Australia. Results
varied among age groups when comparing Australia
and the UK (Table 5).
Published data on oral hygiene behaviours were
available only from the UK and Australia. The per-
centage of people who flossed or used mouthwash was
greater in Australia compared to the UK. Whilst no
dental visiting behaviour was available from Germany,
the UK had the highest percentage of people who

visited a dentist in the last 12 months, and the lowest
percentage of people who have not visited a dentist in
the last five years.
The data are not shown here but compared to the UK
and Germany, the percentage of Australians with one
or more filled teeth was lower among people 44 years
of age or younger. For people in older age groups,
Australia had a greater percentage of people with filled
teeth, with the difference increasing in those aged
55 years or more.
When the preceding data were summarized by
ranking countries, Australia had the best oral health
based on two clinical indicators (edentulism and filled
teeth) and was equal first on three indicators (number
of teeth present, number of decayed tooth surfaces, and
number of coronal filled tooth surfaces) (Table 6).
Australia ranked second in the remaining four clinical
indicators: caries experience, periodontal pocket depth,
people with decayed teeth and periodontal attachment
loss. Australia ranked first or second based on dental
flossing, use of mouthwash and frequency of dental
attendance.
DISCUSSION
This analysis found that Australia ranked first or second
among the four countries studied when they were
ranked according to nine dental clinical indictors
and four oral health-related behaviours. The finding
is in contrast to the OECD 2000 Health Data, where
Australia ranked below the same three countries in
the DMFT index of 35­44 year olds and edentulism
prevalence among people aged 65 years or more.5
These new comparisons indicate that Australia's oral
health relative to other countries is not as poor as that
reported in OECD data.
One explanation for the differing findings was that
tooth loss had declined precipitously in Australia over
the last 10 years.11 The decline has been attributed to
the passing of generations born in the first half of the
20th century when extraction of all teeth was widely
practised.12
Secondly, the contention that Australia had relatively
poor oral health was partly based on the DMFT index
which has inherent problems. For example, it suffers
from its mixing of disease and treatment13 and is based
on the assumption that all filled teeth were carious prior
to the filling which may lead to the overestimation of
the caries experience as expressed by the FT component
of the DMFT.14
Thirdly, the OECD Oral Health data suffer from
limitations in their representativeness because the data
were not always based on nationally representative
samples.15
It is paradoxical that dental visiting behaviour was
better in the UK than in Australia or the US (Table 6)
whereas the UK had the poorest outcomes on three
indicators of tooth loss. Nor did frequent dental
attendance in the UK reflect more frequent oral hygiene
practices. The debate on appropriate dental visiting
behaviour began in 1997 when Sheiham16 found that
though the most frequent dental attenders had the
advantage over the less frequent attenders of having a
higher number of functioning teeth, they also had the
disadvantage of higher levels of dental disease experi-
ence. Later, regular attenders were found to have to
be less likely to suffer acute symptoms and require
emergency treatment.17­19 The debate on the time
interval between check-ups continues to this day with a
recently published Cochrane Review20 finding that
there was insufficient evidence to support or refute
the practise of encouraging patients to attend for dental
check-ups at six-monthly intervals. It included only
one study in the review and that study provided limited
data for dental caries outcomes and economic cost
outcomes. The debate could have been hampered by
the fact that oral health-related quality of life was
not measured. Studies have demonstrated association

Also of interest is the better periodontal health in the
US when measured by periodontal pocket depth and
clinical attachment loss. One explanation could be the
accuracy of the measure. Albander and Rams24 argue
that at a population level, probing pocket depths are of
limited value for the appraisal of the extent and severity
of periodontal diseases. They note that an increase in
probing depth may not be associated with attachment
loss, that the probing depth at a given site is a change-
able measure particularly as the patient ages, and that
probing depth does not provide an accurate measure of
periodontal tissue destruction accumulated over a per-
son's lifetime as reliably as assessments of periodontal
attachment level. However, in this study attachment loss
was also greater in the Australian to the US population.
Australians had a higher mean number of missing
teeth for older age groups than US citizens. An argument
that the difference in attachment loss may be due to a
higher number of retained teeth being accompanied by
an increase in the prevalence of attachment loss is not
valid because it is in the older age groups that clinical
attachment loss is expected to be found. Knowledge
concerning risk factors for periodontal destruction is
still being accumulated.25 It may be that US citizens
are more aware of periodontal health than Australian
citizens but any proposed explanation of the difference
in periodontal health between Australia and the US at
this stage would be speculation.
Several limitations hampered the comparisons made
in this analysis. The surveys were conducted as much as
10 years apart, with Australia's being the most recent.
This favoured Australia in measures of tooth loss which
have declined markedly in all countries. However, that
effect would be relatively small in comparison with
Germany or the US. A second problem was the use of
different examination protocols among the surveys. For
example, Australia used a modification of the NHANES
protocol for periodontal assessments, whereas the UK
and Germany used other protocols. However, this is
likely to be less problematic for measures such as tooth
loss and fillings, where protocol variations produce
only minor differences in population levels. A further
limitation was that 95% CIs were reported only for the
US, so it was not possible to determine if Australia
differed to a statistically significant degree from the UK
or Germany. Finally, data were available from only
three other western countries, so it was not possible to
determine if previously reported OECD rankings for
other countries might have changed as dramatically as
shown here for Australia.
Despite these limitations, there was a generally
consistent pattern to indicate that Australian adults
ranked relatively highly in their oral health compared
with the other three countries. Certainly the findings
were in marked contrast to the previous OECD
rankings, cited for 2000. This turnaround highlights
hazards that probably are inherent in ranking national
data when their representativeness cannot be assured,
and when that data were from markedly different time
points. Indeed, we were unable to find the original
OECD report that ranked 29 nations, a report that is
said to be available on CD-ROM.3 Hence, it was not
possible to verify the magnitude of differences that may
have existed between countries in that report, and it
was impossible for us to verify sampling details or other
methodological features of the studies used to generate
the data.
CONCLUSIONS
Oral health of Australian adults as measured by 13
clinical and behavioural indicators, was better than
indicated in previous OECD Health data.
