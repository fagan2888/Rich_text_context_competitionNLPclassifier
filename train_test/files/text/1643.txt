Abstract From a longitudinal sample (n = 957; 49.9%
male; 77.3% White/non-Hispanic) of participants studied
from infancy through age 15, adolescents' depth of
engagement in, and quality of romantic relationships were
predicted from early and contemporaneous parent­child
interactive quality and peer social competence. High
quality maternal parenting and peer experiences prior to
and during adolescence tended to be negatively associated
with the depth of engagement in this domain for the full
sample, yet positively associated with the quality of ado-
lescents' romantic relationships for the sub-set of
individuals currently dating at age 15. Results reconcile
contrasting views of the origins of romantic relationship
engagement and quality and the positive versus negative
developmental salience of romantic relationships in
adolescence.

Introduction
In recent years, adolescence scholars (Collins 2003; Fur-
man et al. 1999) have made a compelling case that
adolescent romantic relationships represent an important
context of human development, in particular by empha-
sizing that these relationships likely integrate the functions
of, and are in part organized by, prior and contemporane-
ous experiences with parents and peers. In apparent
contrast, however, other evidence has called into question
whether such early romantic relationships--though quite
normative in this age period--should be considered salient
developmental tasks in adolescence, in part because (a)
competence in this domain may not have long-term pre-
dictive significance for adaptation in adulthood (Roisman
et al. 2004) and (b) precocious engagement in this domain
may actually undermine development (Davies and Windle
2000; Neemann et al. 1995). The present study attempts to
reconcile these two lines of research by examining whether
high-quality parenting and peer experiences prior to and
during adolescence were negatively associated with the
depth of romantic relationship engagement (e.g., number of
serious relationships; sexual experience) for a cohort
tracked from infancy to age 15. Then, for the subsample
with a current romantic involvement at the time of the age
15 survey, we examined whether high-quality parenting
and peer experiences prior to and during adolescence were
positively associated with romantic relationship quality.

Most theories of the development of romantic relation-
ships have focused on parents' influence on adolescents
(Connolly et al. 2000). According to attachment theorists,
the attachment behavioral system provides the foundation
for the attachment, caretaking, and sexual behavior systems
operating in romantic relationships (Furman and Wehner
1994). Early experiences in attachment relationships affect
individuals' ability to form affectional bonds as well as the
quality of these bonds. Hazan and Shaver (1987) proposed
that representations of parent­child relationships influence
representations of romantic relationships because these
relationships serve similar attachment functions, suggest-
ing continuities between experiences with primary
caregivers and the quality of later romantic attachments.
Although some research has shown links between child­
parent attachment and romantic relationships, these studies
frequently have focused on late adolescents and young
adults (e.g., Collins et al. 2002; Roisman et al. 2005, 2001;
Scharf and Mayseless 2001), perhaps because, until
recently, it was assumed that romantic relationships in
adolescence were of little developmental significance
(Collins 2003). In one exception, Engles et al. (2001)
showed that attachment to parents was related to 15- to
18-year-old adolescents' social skills, which in turn were
associated with adolescents' friendship and romantic rela-
tionship competence. Other research indicates that negative
emotionality (e.g., anger, ambivalence) in parent­adoles-
cent dyads is predictive of poor quality interactions with
romantic partners in late adolescence (Kim and Capaldi
2004). Thus, there is some evidence that individuals with
more supportive experiences with parents also tend to have
higher quality romantic relationships in adolescence.
An alternative view is that adolescents' romantic rela-
tionships, particularly those that occur before late
adolescence, are more closely aligned with their relation-
ships with close friends and other peers than with their
relationships, past and present, with parents (Connolly
et al. 2000; Furman 1999). Early and middle adolescents'
romantic relationships are less intimate than later romantic
relationships and primarily involve the affiliative and sex-
ual systems rather than the attachment and caregiving
systems (Connolly and Johnson 1996; Furman 1999;
Furman and Wehner 1994). Furthermore, romantic rela-
tionships are egalitarian and develop within the peer
network, unlike child­parent attachment relationships
(Furman and Wehner 1994). Indeed, early on, Sullivan
(1953) proposed that the capacity for intimacy first devel-
ops during pre-adolescence in same-sex friendships.
According to Sullivan, once puberty begins, heterosexual
adolescents begin to desire and seek intimacy in opposite-
sex romantic relationships, transferring what they have
learned in same-sex friendships to opposite-sex romantic
relationships.
There is some empirical evidence of associations
between the qualities of peer and romantic relationships
(Connolly et al. 2000; Connolly and Johnson 1996; Furman
and Wehner 1994; Furman et al. 2002; Shulman et al.
1997). In addition, Furman and colleagues have stated that
current evidence indicates that links between supportive
characteristics of parental and romantic relationships are
weaker than those between friend and romantic relation-
ships in adolescence, yet virtually no study of adolescents'
romantic relationships has included data on parent­child
and friend relationships beginning in infancy and early
childhood, respectively (Furman 1999; Furman et al. 2002;
cf. Collins and Sroufe 1999).
The current study aims to address this gap in the liter-
ature using prospective, longitudinal data drawn from a
cohort of over 1,000 youth tracked from infancy through
age 15 as part of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth
Development (NICHD SECCYD). Specifically, we drew
on outcome data on romantic relationship engagement and
quality (the latter for the subset currently involved in a
romantic relationship) from the age 15 assessment of this
cohort, as well as observational data on maternal sensitivity
and mother-reports of participants' peer competence from
childhood through mid-adolescence.
Hypotheses
Following from the results of studies conducted to date on
adolescent romantic relationships reviewed above, we
expected that both parent­child and peer relationships in
childhood and adolescence are likely to be correlated with
the quality of adolescents' romantic relationships at age 15,
such that supportive experiences with parents and peers is
reflected in higher quality romantic relationships during
adolescence. However, in line with recent theory and evi-
dence that romantic relationships represent emerging
(rather than already salient) tasks of development in ado-
lescence (Roisman et al. 2004), we hypothesized (a) that
high-quality experiences with parents and peers are most
likely to be reflected in higher-quality romantic relation-
ships for the sub-set of adolescents who engage in them,
yet (b) negatively associated with indicators of intense
engagement in this domain. This latter hypothesis is con-
sistent with other empirical evidence that family
experiences can, in part, influence the likelihood that
adolescents engage in risky sexual behavior (Coley and
Chase-Lansdale 1998; Ellis et al. 2003) and longstanding
theoretical arguments that adolescence reflects a period
focused on the development of identity, only after which
(in adulthood) does intimacy (with romantic partners)
emerge as a central theme of development (Erikson 1968).

Method
Participants
Participants were enrolled in the NICHD SECCYD, a
prospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 research
sites across the US (Charlottesville, VA; Irvine, CA;
Lawrence, KS; Little Rock, AR; Madison, WI; Morganton,
NC; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; Seattle, WA; and
Wellesley, MA). During selected 24-h sampling periods
8,986 women who gave birth were screened, and 5,416 met
the eligibility criteria for the study. Families were excluded
if the mother was younger than 18 years of age; the family
planned to move; there was a multiple birth; the infant had
a known disability or remained in the hospital more than
7 days; the mother acknowledged substance abuse; the
mother did not speak English; or the mother lived more
than an hour from the laboratory site or in an extremely
unsafe neighborhood as determined by local police. From
that group, 1,364 families became study participants upon
completing a home interview when their infants were
1 month old. The recruited sample consisted of 52% boys,
24% children of color, 11% mothers not completing high
school, and 14% single-parent families. Additional details
about recruitment and selection procedures are available in
prior publications from the study (see NICHD Early Child
Care Research Network 2005) and from the study web site
(http://secc.rti.org/).
The analysis sample in the present report comprised 957
(49.9% male) of the 1,364 children, due to attrition and
missing data (note that although n = 957 is the sub-sample
of participants at age 15 who completed the measure of
romantic relationship involvement, n = 213 indicated a
current romantic relationship and completed questions
related to quality--ns fluctuate further as a function of
missing data from earlier assessments). Participants inclu-
ded in the n = 957 analysis sample were primarily non-
Hispanic White (77.3%), their mothers had a mean of 14.5
(SD = 2.4) years of education when participants were
1 month old, and their families had a mean income-to-
needs ratio (from 1 month through 15 years) of 4.0
(SD = 3.0).
Procedure
Children were followed from birth through age 15.
Assessments occurred when the children were 1, 6, 15, 24,
36 and 54 months old; when they were in kindergarten and
Grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; and at age 15 (data were
gathered from participants at home, in the laboratory, at
school, and via regular phone calls by trained personnel
from the ten study sites that were centrally trained and
certified to conduct each assessment). The following
sections describe the specific measures used in the present
analyses and the time points of administration. Additional
details about all data collection procedures, psychometric
properties of the instruments, and descriptions of how
composites were derived and constructed can be found in
the study's Manuals of Operation and Instrument Docu-
mentation (http://secc.rti.org).
Measures
Demographic Characteristics
Child gender and maternal education level were obtained
by maternal report at 1 month. Family income was reported
by mothers at each major data collection point (1 month
through age 15) and converted to an income-to-needs ratio
by dividing total family income by the US Census-based
poverty-level income for that family size. Ratios used in
analyses were averaged from data obtained at 1 month
through 15 years. Child race/ethnicity was coded as
1 = White/non-Hispanic, 0 = all others represented in the
cohort (Hispanic, African American, Asian, Native Amer-
ican, biracial, or other).
Maternal Sensitivity
Earlier Maternal Sensitivity Our measure of earlier
maternal sensitivity was calculated from mothers' behavior
during a videotaped interaction between mother and child
under semi-structured conditions at 6, 15, 24, 36,
54 months, and grades 1, 3, and 5 (NICHD Early Child
Care Research Network 1998, 2002). A composite score of
maternal sensitivity was created at each age from coding of
the videotapes for developmentally appropriate indicators
of sensitivity. These composites were transformed to the
same scale and averaged from 6 months to Grade 5
(standardized a = .83).
Contemporaneous Maternal Sensitivity Contemporane-
ous sensitivity was assessed at age 15, via coding of a
video-recorded 8-min home discussion of one or two areas
of disagreement between the adolescent and mother (e.g.,
chores, homework, money), selected by the adolescent (this
variable was standardized for analyses). Seven-point rating
scales of the interaction were used, with higher scores
indicting higher levels of sensitivity (M. T. Owen et al.,
2006, Unpublished manuscript), based on adaptations of
the more micro-analytic coding systems of Allen and his
colleagues (J. P. Allen et al., 2003, Unpublished manu-
script) and coding systems used at earlier ages in the
NICHD SECCYD (e.g., M. T. Owen et al., 2000, Unpub-
lished manuscript). Interrater reliability (intraclass
correlation) was .86.

Peer Competence
Earlier Peer Competence We assessed earlier peer
competence using mother reports on an a priori, internally
consistent peer competence sub-scale derived from the
Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham and Elliott
1990) when children were age 54 months, in kindergarten,
and grades 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. (Standardized alphas for these
scales at each assessment point ranged from .70 to .80;
mean = .75). These scales were, in turn, averaged to form
a single measure of early peer competence (standardized
a = .91).
Contemporaneous Peer Competence At age 15, we
assessed contemporaneous peer competence using the
z-score of the same sub-scale (i.e., peer competence) of the
SSRS (standardized a = .81), again as reported by moth-
ers, with higher scores indicating higher levels of peer
competence. (Note that maternal reports were used at age
15 to maintain consistency with the earlier assessments).
Romantic Relationship Quality and Engagement at Age 15
Romantic Relationship Quality Romantic relationship
quality was measured using items from the Network of
Relationships Inventory (NRI; Furman 1996) pertinent to
romantic relationships that were completed by the partici-
pating adolescents at age 15. Specifically, this slightly
modified 29-item measure resulted in ten a priori scales:
companionship, conflict, instrumental aid, intimacy,
nurturance, affection, admiration, reliable alliance, antag-
onism, and criticism (the internal consistencies of these
scales ranged from .61 to .90; mean = .81). In order to
further reduce the number of dependent measures of
quality, we subjected these NRI sub-scales to a Principal
Components Analysis, which yielded evidence for two
components: (a) positive qualities (i.e., companionship,
instrumental aid, intimacy, nurturance, affection, admira-
tion, reliable alliance; standardized a = .91) and (b)
negative qualities (i.e., conflict, antagonism, and criticism;
standardized a = .89). Note that only participants currently
in a romantic relationship at the age 15 assessment com-
pleted the NRI.
Depth of Romantic Engagement The entire age-15 cohort
completed questions about their depth of engagement in the
romantic domain. For the current study we used the four
indicators derived from a set of descriptive items, in
addition to a measure of sexual behavior, to assess depth of
romantic engagement. More specifically, the four descrip-
tive indicators included (a) a Guttman-like composite scale
of dating experience based on the average of answers given
to five yes/no questions (I only hang out with same-sex
friends [reversed], I go to activities with boys and girls
present, I go to dances with boys and girls present, I go out
at night in group with boys and girls, I go out on dates--but
with a group, and I go out on dates--just the two of us), (b)
Longest romantic relationship (in days), (c) Number of
serious romantic relationships, and (d) the response to the
question: ``Have you ever been deeply in love?'' To assess
sexual behavior, participants were also asked how many
times they had ever had oral sex (recoded either to
0 = never or 1 = one or more times) or engaged in sexual
intercourse (recoded either to 0 = never or 1 = one or
more times) with higher scores indicative of more sexual
involvement. The two sexual behavior indicators were
averaged.
Results
Analytic Plan
Data were analyzed in two steps. First, we provide
descriptive information in order to characterize (a)
involvement in romantic relationships at age 15, as
reflected in dating, sexual, and romantic engagement for
the full cohort and (b) the perceived quality of participants'
romantic relationships for the sub-set of individuals who
were currently dating. Second, we examined early and
contemporaneous parenting and peer competence as pre-
dictors of romantic engagement (for the entire sample) and
perceived quality (for the currently dating sub-group). We
present both correlational data as well as regressions where
all independent variables were simultaneously entered as
predictors of each romantic outcome at age 15. A series of
follow-up regressions were conducted and reported that
also include demographic covariates (i.e., child sex, child
ethnicity, maternal education, and family income-to-needs
through age 15) as predictors in order to examine how
robust effects of sensitivity and peer competence were after
accounting for potential confounds. Note finally that many
of the analyses reported here had high levels of statistical
power to detect statistically significant effects--even for
correlations small in absolute magnitude. As such, con-
sistent with Cohen's (1988) recommendations, we viewed
correlations smaller than r = .10 as of ``trivial'' magnitude.
Descriptive Data
Descriptive data on all romantic relationship dependent
measures are presented in Table 1. Measures of engage-
ment in romantic relationships completed by the full cohort
demonstrate that, with just a few exceptions focused on
dating experience, adolescents were not engaging in high
levels of romantic involvement at age 15. For example,
J Youth Adolescence (2009) 38:1294­1303 1297
123
whereas a strong majority of participants reported going
out at night with groups of boys and girls, less than half had
the experience of dating in groups or in pairs. Similarly,
participants reported that their longest relationships aver-
aged approximately 7 months, they had just over 1 serious
relationship to date, they engaged in relatively low levels
of sexual behavior, and just over a third had ever been
deeply in love. Only 22% of the sample reported a current
romantic relationship. In sum, while a large majority of
participants had some experience in the romantic domain
by age 15, high levels of engagement were relatively
uncommon.
Correlational Analyses
As shown in Table 2, for the full cohort, early and con-
temporaneous peer and parent experiences tended to be
negatively associated with indicators of intense engage-
ment in the romantic domain. There were, nonetheless,
several exceptions and caveats to this trend that should be
noted: (a) a non-significant association between age 15
peer competence and number of serious romantic rela-
tionships, (b) the dating experience outcome was trivially
correlated with early and contemporaneous maternal sen-
sitivity and actually positively associated with both early
and contemporaneous peer competence, and (c) correla-
tions between early peer competence and romantic
engagement, although statistically significant, were trivial
to small in magnitude.
For the 20% of participants who reported being cur-
rently engaged in a romantic relationship, earlier and later
peer and parent experiences were, with one exception, all
significantly and non-trivially associated with the per-
ceived quality of participants' romantic relationships at
age 15, such that higher quality parent and peer experi-
ences were correlated positively with positive features of
these relationships and negatively associated with negative
features. The one exception to this trend was that con-
current maternal sensitivity was not significantly
correlated with either positive or negative romantic rela-
tionship quality.
Regression Analyses
As indicated above, all four independent variables (i.e.,
earlier peer competence, contemporaneous peer compe-
tence, earlier parent­child quality, contemporaneous
parent­child quality) were entered simultaneously into
regressions as predictors of romantic engagement (dating
experience, longest relationship, number of serious
romantic relationships, sexual experience, and ever been
deeply in love?) and measures of quality (positive, nega-
tive). (Note that a logistic regression was conducted for
``Ever deeply in love'' as this outcome variable was
dichotomous). The robustness of significant effects was
challenged by subsequently adding a set of four demo-
graphic variables to the regression analyses.
In general, earlier maternal sensitivity uniquely and
negatively predicted indicators of depth of romantic
engagement, although some of these effects were attenu-
ated with the addition of demographic covariates (see
Tables 3, 4). One partial exception to this general trend
was the regressions predicting dating experience, with age
15 peer competence positively associated with the

outcome, even with demographic controls in place. Earlier
peer competence was uniquely predictive of romantic
quality (see Table 5, Model I). After adding demographic
covariates (see Table 5, Model II), this effect remained for
the prediction of positive but not negative quality. Earlier
maternal sensitivity emerged as a significant predictor of
positive quality in these more complex models. Note that
the variables cumulatively accounted for modest propor-
tions of the variance in each romantic outcome (3­8% in
Model I, which did not include demographic covariates and
6­13% in Model II equations, which did include these
control variables).
Discussion
The results of this study were consistent both with evidence
that adolescent romantic relationships reflect current and
past relationship experiences with parents and peers (Fur-
man et al. 1999) as well as the notion that the romantic
domain may not be a salient developmental task of mid-
adolescence (Roisman et al. 2004). Specifically, we found
that high-quality experiences with parents and peers prior to
and during adolescence tended to be negatively associated
with indicators of intense engagement in this domain for the
full NICHD SECCYD cohort, but positively associated with
the reported quality of adolescents' romantic relationships
at age 15 for the sub-set of adolescents engaged in them.
We resist the interpretation that evidence that peer and
parent experiences were negatively correlated with indicators
of romantic engagement is merely reflective of a kind of
pseudo-intimacythatcharacterizes adolescentswho engagein
a relatively large number of relationships. Instead, given that
supportive relationships with parents were associated with a
wide range of indicators of intense romantic involvement, we
are more inclined to interpret these findings as suggesting that
serious engagement of this domain (either in terms of quantity
of partners or depth of emotional investment) is less than
optimaldevelopmentally(DaviesandWindle 2000;Neemann
et al. 1995), perhaps in part because it is not until adulthood
thatintimacy insuch relationships becomes a key challenge of
development (Erikson 1968).
We should also note that, because the theoretical per-
spectives that framed this analysis do not claim that
processes differ by males versus females, we did not
present relevant moderator analyses. Nonetheless,

supplementary analyses revealed no instance where a sig-
nificant regression effect was moderated by sex. In
addition, although our composites of earlier peer compe-
tence and maternal sensitivity aggregated data across a
wide age range, in follow-up analyses we found no evi-
dence that predictors assessed in infancy, preschool, or
grade school were more or less strongly associated with the
outcomes explored in this report. Also, it should be

emphasized that analyses examining depth of engagement
were based on the full NICHD SECCYD cohort, whereas
the romantic quality questions explored in this study
focused on the sub-set of participants currently in a (self-
defined) romantic relationship at age 15. We do not present
depth of engagement analyses for the romantically
involved sub-group largely because indicators of depth of
engagement are censored at the low end of the relationship
quality distribution among such individuals. Indeed, not
surprisingly, associations between early and later peer and
parent experiences and depth of engagement indicators
failed to emerge in supplementary analyses focused on the
currently involved sub-sample.
The current study has a number of strengths. First,
measures of peer, parent­child, and romantic relationships
were drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of
development, resulting in evidence that experiences prior
to adolescence were uniquely predictive of adolescent
romantic relationship engagement and quality, above and
beyond comparable contemporaneous assessments of par-
ent and peer experience. Second, in no instance were
associations between predictors and outcomes overesti-
mated by the use of a single informant or measure,
resulting in a relatively conservative test of our hypotheses.
Finally, this study is among the first to distinguish among
the origins of different parameters of functioning in ado-
lescent romantic relationships (for an excellent theoretical
taxonomy, see Collins 2003).
This research is nonetheless limited in several respects.
Perhaps most critically, although rich information is
available on participants in the NICHD SECCYD from
infancy through adolescence, data specific to participants'
romantic relationships are exclusively self-report. Argu-
ably, information regarding involvement in the romantic
domain (e.g., number of romantic partners, ever been
deeply in love?) is best acquired from the adolescent him or
herself. However, our assessment of relationship quality
was also focused on the adolescents' perceptions of those
experiences, an important though by no means compre-
hensive indicator of interpersonal functioning that is
ideally complemented with observational and other mea-
sures. Additionally, it should be noted that social
competence data for the current analysis derived exclu-
sively from maternal-report, and the study, though multi-
site, is not based on a nationally representative sample.
The current analysis contributes to the literature in a
number of respects. Specifically, results of this study sup-
port the notion that adolescents' romantic relationships
reflect the relational history of those involved in them in
mid-adolescence, both with parents and peers as assessed
prospectively from infancy forward. In contrast, given
evidence reported here and elsewhere that supportive early
and later relationship experiences (particularly with
parents) are normatively reflected in less intense engage-
ment in the romantic domain in adolescence, it appears that
adolescent romantic competence--at least by age
15--should not be regarded as a defining developmental
task within which adaptation in adolescence is judged.
