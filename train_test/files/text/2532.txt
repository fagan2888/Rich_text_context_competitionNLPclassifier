When people are presented with a random list of digits to remember over an interval of a few seconds, the cognitive
systems that are used are mainly verbal working memory systems, and these are different from those used when
remembering visuospatial information. Our previous work has demonstrated that under certain circumstances, visuospatial
memory processes can assist verbal memory processes. If a sequence of random numbers is presented for immediate recall
in order, memory is better if the digits are displayed on a familiar telephone keypad array compared to either an unfamiliar
random keypad or a single item. We previously argued that this was evidence for the existence of processes (described in
many modern theories of memory) that could integrate information held in long-term memory (knowledge about the
keypad) with short-term visuospatial memory for sequences of locations and short-term verbal memory for sequences of
digits. In the current article, we report a study that demonstrates that this pattern remains present in a sample of older
(55­76 years) adults compared to a younger sample (19­35 years). There are important benefits of this identification of
the age-resilience of linkages between different types of information in short-term memory. One specific benefit is to
theories of aging, but a second, broader, benefit may be that we can capitalize upon this finding to develop strategies and
techniques for boosting the efficiency of working memory in older adults, an outcome that would have many benefits to
an aging population.

Recent studies on verbal immediate serial recall show evidence of the integration of information from verbal and
visuospatial short-term memory with long-term memory representations. Verbal serial recall is improved when the
information is arranged in a familiar spatially distributed pattern, such as a telephone keypad. This pattern, termed
visuospatial bootstrapping, is consistent with the existence within working memory of an episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2000).
The present experiment aimed to investigate whether similar results would be obtained in a sample of older adults. Older
(55­76) and younger (19­35) adults carried out visual serial recall in 3 visual display conditions that have previously been
used to demonstrate visuospatial bootstrapping. Results demonstrated better performance when digits were presented in a
typical telephone keypad display. Although digit serial recall declined with age, there was no evidence that this visuospatial
bootstrapping effect differed in size between older and younger adults. Theoretical and practical implications of these
results are described.

Current models of working memory (e.g., Baddeley, 2000) propose
that it functions as an ensemble of different processes. These include
so-called "slave systems," broadly passive stores that maintain infor-
mation over short periods. Other processes can manipulate informa-
tion held in the slave systems; many such processes are considered
part of a central executive, a limited set of control resources that are
recruited for tasks such as planning, sequencing, and inhibition (Bad-
deley, 2010; Baddeley, Allen & Hitch, 2011).
There is good evidence of a clear distinction between verbal and
visuospatial temporary memory systems (Smith, Jonides, & Koeppe,
1996; Baddeley, Lewis, & Vallar, 1984; Quinn & McConnell, 1996).
Despite this, memory often needs to maintain links between attributes
that fall into supposedly separate domains; for example, in tasks
where participants must remember the location and content of a verbal
stimulus (e.g., Prabhakaran, Narayanan, Zhao, & Gabrieli, 2000). To
accommodate this, Baddeley (2000) proposed a further component of
working memory, the episodic buffer. This limited capacity store is
assumed to be recruited when domain specific information, such as
that held in working memory slave systems and in long-term memory
(LTM), has to be linked together and the link needs to be temporarily
retained; for example, remembering what item went where, or remem-
bering that a word was presented in red ink.
Representations composed of conjunctions of visual stimulus ele-
ments are evidently formed and retained in memory (e.g., Allen,
Baddeley, & Hitch, 2006; Allen, Hitch, & Baddeley, 2009; Baddeley,
Hitch, & Allen, 2009; Bao, Li, & Zhang, 2007; Karlsen, Allen,
Baddeley, & Hitch, 2010). Binding of this type can proceed automat-
ically without the intervention of executive attentional processes
(Allen, Baddeley, & Hitch, 2014; Allen, Hitch, Mate, & Baddeley,
2012), leading to the conclusion that binding processes in the episodic
buffer can operate broadly independently of the central executive
(Baddeley et al., 2011). Such patterns of binding are not limited to
attributes that broadly share the same perceptual domain: There is
evidence of binding between materials in verbal and visuospatial
temporary memory (Bao et al., 2007; Prabhakaran et al., 2000) and
that information stored in different modalities can interact or compete
(Mate, Allen, & Baqués, 2012; Morey & Cowan, 2004, 2005).
Binding between verbal and visuospatial working memory has been
observed repeatedly in a series of studies using a task that avoids
explicitly asking participants to "bind" information at all, hence
demonstrating implicit cross-modality feature binding, an effect
termed visuospatial bootstrapping (Darling & Havelka, 2010; Dar-
ling, Allen, Havelka, Campbell, & Rattray, 2012; Darling, Parker,
Goodall, Havelka, & Allen, 2014; Allen, Havelka, Falcon, Evans, &
Darling, 2014). In this task, information presented visually for verbal
serial recall is recalled better when the visual display is arranged in a
familiar spatially distributed pattern, a telephone keypad, than when
to-be-remembered numbers are presented one after another in a single
location. For such patterns to be observed, memory performance must
have been improved (i.e., bootstrapped) by the integration of visu-
ospatial information when it was available in the display. This obser-
vation was assumed (Darling & Havelka, 2010) to reflect the retention
of bindings of visuospatial information (locations), and verbal infor-
mation (digits), facilitating performance. Visuospatial bootstrapping
is consistent with the episodic buffer addition to the working memory
model described previously.
Processes underlying visuospatial bootstrapping require the exis-
tence of a familiar representation in LTM because only well-known
displays (phone keypads) elicit the effect, whereas unfamiliar displays
(random keypads) do not (Darling et al., 2012, 2014). A comparable
pattern exists when spatial material is to be remembered: long-term
spatial memory influences working memory for spatial configurations
(Brown & Wesley, 2013). Taken together, it seems that that arrays in
LTM can facilitate more effective recall in working memory. How-
ever, the visuospatial bootstrapping pattern also requires the operation
of visuospatial working memory components: It is completely atten-
uated under a random tapping task assumed to load visuospatial
working memory whereas it is slightly exaggerated under verbal
working memory load (Allen et al., 2014).
Visuospatial bootstrapping appears to develop along a characteris-
tic trajectory (Darling et al., 2014): Although a clear bootstrapping
effect is observed in adults and 9-year-olds, there is no evidence of a
similar effect at 6 years of age. Based on this, visuospatial bootstrap-
ping seems to attain a magnitude comparable to that of adults between
ages of 6 and 9. This apparent maturation of bootstrapping precedes
the maturation of memory capacity in both visual and verbal domains
which continues to increase through adolescence (Siegel, 1994), a
type of pattern that suggests the involvement of different cognitive
resources (Gathercole, 1999).
Although the pattern of visuospatial bootstrapping in young adults
and children has been investigated, it is unclear what the effects of
aging on visuospatial bootstrapping might be. The current research is
specifically targeted at investigating the visuospatial bootstrapping
effect in typically aging older adults. Hence, we report an assessment
of visuospatial bootstrapping that was carried out in a sample of
younger and older adults.
Working Memory in Aging
Normal aging is associated with a decline in several cognitive
functions (Manan, Franz, Yusoff, & Mukari, 2013) including working
memory, auditory processing, (Anderson, Parbery-Clark, Yi, &
Kraus, 2011; Dew, Buchler, Dobbins, & Cabeza, 2012), attention
(Smith et al., 2001) and LTM (Park, Lautenschlager, Hedden, David-
son, Smith, & Smith, 2002). Many researchers consider working
memory to be a key factor in age-related cognitive decline (Borella,
Cornoldi, & De Beni, 2009; Bopp & Verhaeghen, 2005; Borella,
Carretti, & De Beni, 2008), as it has been repeatedly observed that
working memory declines with aging (Jost, Bryck, Vogel, & Mayr,
2011; Myerson, Emery, White, & Hale, 2003; Chen Hale, & Myerson,
2003) in a gradual and linear fashion (Vaughan & Hartman, 2009; for
a review, see Rajah & D'Esposito, 2005).
Working memory decline might explain the difficulties faced by
older adults in a wide variety of tests of fluid cognition (Baddeley,
1989; Dobbs & Rule, 1989; Verhaeghen & Salthouse, 1997), in
contrast to a minimal decline in crystallized intelligence performance
(Schaie, 2005). Visual working memory is more strongly correlated
with general fluid intelligence, whereas verbal working memory is
more strongly associated with crystallized intelligence (Bergman &
Almkvist, 2013; Dang, Braeken, Ferrer, & Liu, 2012; Haavisto, &
Lehto, 2005; though see Colom, Flores-Mendoza, & Rebollo, 2003;
Conway, Cowan, Bunting, Therriault, & Minkoff, 2002; Verguts &
De Boeck, 2001), possibly reflecting increased executive demands of
common visuospatial working memory tasks (e.g., Vandierendonck,
Kemps, Fastame, & Szmalec, 2004). In line with this, research has
demonstrated that visuospatial working memory is particularly age-
sensitive, compared to the verbal component of working memory (Bo,
Jennett, Seidler, 2012; Hale et al., 2011; Park et al., 2002; Jenkins,
Myerson, Joerding, & Hale, 2000; Jenkins, Myerson, Hale, & Fry,
1999; Verhaeghen, Cerella, Semenec, Leo, Bopp, & Steitz, 2002;
Bopp & Verhaeghen, 2007). Thus, separable subcomponents may
have different age-related trajectories (Dang et al., 2012). It should be
noted, however, that findings are somewhat mixed on this point, with
some studies reporting older adults' superior performance in the
visual-spatial domain than in the verbal (Fastenau, Denburg, & Abe-

BOOTSTRAPPING AND AGING
les, 1996; Vecchi, Richardson, & Cavallini, 2005), or no clear differ-
ences in age-related decline between visuospatial and verbal memory
across the life span (e.g., Borella, Ghisletta, & de Ribaupierre, 2011;
Kemps & Newson, 2006).
Nevertheless, if visuospatial working memory is indeed subject to
decline in typical aging we might expect to see an attenuation of the
visuospatial bootstrapping effect in older adults, in reflection of the
important role of visuospatial processing in visuospatial bootstrapping
(Allen et al., 2014).
In addition to declines in verbal and visuospatial working memory,
it has been suggested that memory for the bindings between elements
in memory may be particularly impaired with healthy aging. For
example, studies have shown that older adults are less accurate on
tests of shape-location binding, relative to memory for the individual
elements (Borg, Leroy, Favre, Laurent, & Thomas-Anterion, 2011;
Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Mitchell, Johnson, Raye, & D'Esposito,
2000; Thomas, Bonura, Taylor, & Brunyé, 2012). This may be spe-
cific to tasks requiring binding to location, as other forms of binding
(e.g., between shape and color) do not consistently produce age-
related declines (see Allen, Brown, & Niven, 2013, for a review). As
visuospatial bootstrapping may be based on binding between digit and
location, we might therefore expect to see the bootstrapping effect
reduced or abolished with age.
Age-related decline has been observed to be more impactful in
complex (storage and processing) compared to simple (storage only)
span tasks (Mammarella, Borella, Pastore, & Pazzaglia, 2013), and in
those that require a high level of executive control, independently of
type of material presented (De Ribaupierre & Lecerf, 2006; De
Ribaupierre & Ludwig, 2002; Park et al., 2002). However this pattern
has not been universally observed: using carefully matched stimuli,
Hale et al. (2011) observed that the rate of age-related performance
decline was the same for both simple and complex tasks within the
respective verbal and visuospatial domains, though decline in the
visuospatial domain was greater than in the verbal.
One possible reason for such patterns may relate to the HAROLD
model of cerebral aging (Cabeza, 2001; Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore,
& McIntosh, 2002), which argues for a more bilateral recruitment of
the prefrontal cortex in older age. In typical young adults, brain
activation is predominantly left lateralized for verbal and right later-
alized for visuospatial working memory, whereas older adults show
more bilateral activation patterns for both types of memory (Reuter-
Lorenz, Jonides, Smith, Hartley, Miller, Marshuetz, & Koeppe, 2000).
The implications of this for bootstrapping are unclear; however, one
possible interpretation is that the specialized visuospatial systems
associated with strong cerebral lateralization might also decline with
age leading to decreased bootstrapping. Alternatively, as specialized
verbal memory systems become less effective, older adults may gain
a greater relative benefit of bootstrapping--in much the same way that
participants carrying out articulatory suppression tasks showed greater
bootstrapping (Allen et al., 2014) in which case bootstrapping would
increase with age.
Another relevant perspective is the scaffolding theory of aging and
cognition (STAC: Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). This suggests that
one of the outcomes of an adaptive brain that engages in compensa-
tory scaffolding in response to the challenges posed by declining
neural structures and function is the increase of frontal activation with
age. According to the authors, STAC is a process that involves use
and development of complementary and alternative neural circuits to
achieve a cognitive goal and it is present across the life span. As
bootstrapping is by definition an alternate route toward achieving a
goal, then it would seem logical to suggest that the STAC framework
would predict the persistence of bootstrapping into old age.
To address these contrasting predictions, the current study was
designed to investigate visuospatial bootstrapping in an older adult
sample. As in previous work, a single-digit condition was contrasted
with a typical keypad condition and a random keypad condition, with
the latter condition included to estimate the degree to which a familiar
representation of a particular spatial array is necessary for the obser-
vation of visuospatial bootstrapping-based facilitation.
Method
Participants
A total of 110 participants entered into this study. Samples of 55
older adults (M age  63.5, SD  5.6, range: 55 to 76; M years of
formal education  12.2, SD  4.6; 34 females) and 55 younger
adults (M age  28.0, SD  4.0, range: 19 to 35; M years of formal
education: 15.9, SD  2.5; 30 females) were recruited. Younger
adults were recruited from students and staff of the Hospital and
University of Bari and wider Bari community, whereas older partic-
ipants were recruited from cultural associations in Bari (Italy).
Each participant was assessed with a brief neuropsychological
battery of tests and a visuospatial bootstrapping task (described be-
low). This battery measured cognitive function with the Mini Mental
Status examination (MMSE: Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975),
intellectual capacity with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices
(RCPM: Raven, Raven, & Court, 1993), verbal memory span with
Digit Span forward & backward test (Wechsler, 1997), visual memory
span with the Visual Patterns Test (VPT: Della Sala, Gray, Baddeley,
& Wilson, 1997) and spatial memory span with the Corsi Block
Tapping Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987). These tasks were used to
check that participants were aging in a typical (rather than atypical)
pattern.
Participants were given a brief interview to exclude those with
serious health problems or those on medication that can cause drows-
iness or affect cognitive functioning. All participants were asked to
provide informed consent for research participation. This project
received approval from the Research Ethics Committee at Queen
Margaret University.
Design
Participants were tested at their own span, assessed in a pretest.
Display type (single digit [SD], typical keypad [TKP], and random
keypad [RKP]) was a within-subjects factor manipulated in blocks
and age group was between-subjects factor. There were 30 trials in
each block. The dependent variable was the number of completely
correctly recalled sequences (out of a total of 30).
Materials and Procedure
Figure 1 shows the displays used in the three display conditions. A
laptop PC with a 15-in display was used to present the stimuli, which
were compiled using e-Prime 2 (Psychology Software Tools, 2013).
In each trial of every display condition participants tried to remem-
ber a random sequence of digits (no digit was repeated in a sequence).
The sequence length was set at the single-item capacity measured in
the pretest. The participant started the session by pressing a key on the
keyboard.
SD display. Following a fixation screen (500 ms), the digit se-
quence was presented in a single square (with a green background and
side of 120 px) in the middle of the screen. Each digit was shown for
1,000 ms, with a 250 ms interval between digits, during which the
screen was blank. Digits were presented in the Arial font, point size

36. After the final digit, there was a retention interval of 1,000 ms,
following which the message "Ripeti" (repeat) appeared in the middle
of the screen and participants attempted to verbally recall the se-
quence of digits in the correct order, without a time limit.
TKP display. In the TKP condition, the digits 0­9 were pre-
sented in the same array used in a traditional telephone keypad,
aligned centrally on the screen (see Figure 1) and within outline boxes
of similar dimensions to the box described in the SD condition above.
There was a horizontal and vertical spacing of 20 px between the 120
px outlines surrounding each digit. The sequences were indicated by
successively highlighting the background of the digits in the to-be-
remembered sequence, in green, for 1,000 ms, at which point the
background reverted to clear. Between items, the entire array was
cleared for 250 ms.
RKP. The RKP keyboard condition was similar to the TKP
condition, except that the locations of the digits were randomized and
hence unfamiliar to participants--they did not appear in their typical
locations. Following the first trial, however, digit locations remained
consistent throughout remaining trials in this condition.
Pretest. Prior to the three experimental conditions, participants
took part in a pretest to ascertain their baseline span. The SD display
(described above) was used for this pretest. Participants were asked to
carry out two trials at a given sequence length, beginning with just one
item. If they remembered at least one trial, they would then progress
to the next sequence length. However, if they failed to recall either
sequence the procedure stopped. Span was then determined to be the
maximum sequence length at which participants recalled at least one
sequence correctly.
Results
Two participants did not complete the full test session, and hence
their data is excluded from all reporting. With regard to overall
memory capacity in the single-item span pretest, mean span was 4.76
items (SD  1.16, min  3, max  8) for the group of older adults,
whereas it was significantly higher for the younger adult participants
(M  5.81 items: SD  0.87, min  4, max  8), t(106)  5.33, d
 1.02, p  .001. The differential between older and younger adults
here was broadly comparable with that observed in the Weschler
Digits Forward Task (Table 1 gives full details of performance on the
background assessment battery of participants in the study), though it
is noteworthy that performance on the visually presented digit span
pretest was somewhat worse for both groups than on the verbally
presented Weschler Digits Forward Task.
Our main focus of attention was the evaluation of visuospatial
bootstrapping--which would be evidenced by better performance in
the TKP condition compared to the SD. The data in Table 2 show this
pattern and a mixed 2 (age group)  2 (display type: TKP/SD)
analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed this conclusion, demon-
strating a significant main effect of display across the two groups, F(1,
106)  16.485, p
2  .135, p  .001. Although the magnitude of
bootstrapping was somewhat greater in the younger sample, the in-
teraction between display type and age group was not statistically
significant, F(1, 106)  1.832, p
2  .017, p  .179. The main effect
of age group was also not significant, F(1, 106)  .009, p
2  .000,
p  .924.
To assess the conservative hypothesis that visuospatial bootstrap-
ping could be observed independently in each of the age samples, an
assessment of the simple main effect of display (comparing perfor-
mance in the SD and TKP conditions) was carried out in each age
group independently. This comparison was significant in younger
adults, F(1, 106)  14.654, p
2  0.121, p (one-tailed)  .001, and in
older adults, F(1, 106)  3.663, p
2  .033, p (one-tailed)  .029.
To assess whether an unfamiliar display could support bootstrap-
ping, a mixed 2 (age group)  2 (display type: single/random)

Discussion
The present study is the first to demonstrate visuospatial bootstrap-
ping in a sample of older adults, and the principal conclusion is that
both older and younger adults displayed a visuospatial bootstrapping
effect. Older and younger adults also did not differ significantly in
terms of the size of the bootstrapping benefit obtained by presenting
digits in a familiar keypad array. In addition, when simple main
effects of display were assessed independently for each age group,
there was a significant benefit for typical keypads in both groups.
Hence we can conclude that visuospatial bootstrapping in visually
presented immediate serial recall of digits is indeed a phenomenon
that persists across the course of typical aging.
This is both the first time that bootstrapping has been observed in
an older adult sample and also the first time that it has been observed
in a non-English speaking sample (Italian), thus it is noteworthy that
in the younger adult condition the pattern of bootstrapping replicates
exactly that seen on several occasions in groups of English-speaking
young adults (Darling & Havelka, 2010; Darling et al., 2012; Darling
et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2014). Furthermore, older adults' perfor-
mances on the neuropsychological battery were in no way atypical.
Consequently we have no grounds to suspect limits on the generaliz-
ability of these findings, at least to samples that would be expected to
be familiar with numeric keypads.
Performance in both age groups was significantly better in the
(familiar) TKP condition compared to the SD condition, whereas
unfamiliar (RKP) keypads offered no benefit to performance. Hence
it is clear that the visuospatial bootstrapping effect requires the avail-
ability of a familiar visuospatial representation in LTM, an observa-
tion that is entirely consistent with previous results in younger adults
and older children (Darling et al., 2014).
Taking into account the evidence from previous studies (Darling et
al., 2012, 2014), it can be argued that visuospatial bootstrapping
seems to develop around 9 years of age and remains relatively stable
across the life span, into old age. This pattern is in contrast with other
changes that occur with the progression of age. For example, there is
clear evidence of declines in several cognitive functions and particu-
larly in working memory (Jost et al., 2011; Myerson et al., 2003; Chen
et al., 2003), including visuospatial working memory (Thomas et al.,
2012; Bo et al., 2012; Jenkins et al., 2000, 1999; Verhaeghen et al.,
2002; Bopp & Verhaeghen, 2007). In addition, some studies have
suggested that identity-location binding in working memory is subject
to particular age-related declines (see Allen et al., 2013). In contrast,
visuospatial bootstrapping appears to be relatively robust to cognitive
decline.
Although there was no significant interaction between age and
display type, it would be incorrect to assume equivalence between the
magnitude of bootstrapping in older and younger participants. There
are two reasons for this: the pattern of means appears to suggest that
the benefit of TKP displays was slightly greater for younger partici-
pants and, in addition, asserting the absence of an effect statistically is
difficult. However, it is to be noted that this study was powered to
detect small to medium effects (minimum p
2  .029;   .05,  
.95), and yet no significant interaction was observed, so it is likely that
any unobserved effect would at most be relatively small.
Consequently, although full equivalence of bootstrapping in the two
cohorts was not demonstrated beyond doubt, it is appropriate to claim
that we have found no evidence that bootstrapping changes over
normal aging. Therefore we assert that visuospatial bootstrapping is
relatively robust to aging, and certainly that it is preserved to some
extent in aging, with the caveat that further research is merited to
establish whether effect sizes in older and younger adults are equal.
It is important to note that these effects are observed in a paradigm
whereby difficulty is set on a per-individual basis and therefore that
the underlying visuospatial and verbal memory systems may not be so
robust to age. Indeed, the significant difference in performance be-
tween age groups on the pretest span assessment and on the VPT and
Corsi blocks tasks indicate declines in both visuospatial and verbal
working memory capacity with age. Fluid cognition (e.g., logical
problem solving; Horn & Cattell, 1967), declines over the course of
normal aging (Schaie, 2005).
Within this context it is possible that visuospatial bootstrapping
reflects an important contribution from visuospatial long-term knowl-
edge that can sustain the function of an otherwise declining visuospa-
tial working memory, though it is now clear that LTM is necessary,
but not sufficient, to produce visuospatial bootstrapping (Allen et al.,
2014). Overall, the present study suggests that although both verbal
and visuospatial working memory did decline with age, the necessary
working memory resources were still available to support visuospatial
bootstrapping. Given that visuospatial bootstrapping seems reason-
ably robust against aging, this makes it a potentially fruitful candidate
for further research into interventions that may assist individuals with
age-related memory difficulties. It may also indicate that the form of
implicit identity-location binding possibly underlying the visuospatial
bootstrapping effect differs from those tapped by explicit tests of
binding that have previously shown age-related decline (e.g., Mitchell
et al., 2000).
Current theories aimed at addressing the cognitive difficulties faced
by older adults (Manan et al., 2013; Kemps & Newson, 2006; Bopp
& Verhaeghen, 2005; Park et al., 2002) might broadly be thought to
predict that visuospatial bootstrapping would decline over age (though
some theories are hard to specify clear predictions from, e.g., Cabeza,
2001; Cabeza et al., 2002), but the present data are not really consis-
tent with this. A full understanding of this will require future research,
but it is possible that visuospatial bootstrapping can exploit compen-
satory mechanisms through a plastic reorganization of neurocognitive
networks as described by Cabeza et al. (2002) in their HAROLD
model and by Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009) in their STAC frame-
work. The STAC framework considers the engagement of scaffolding
an adaptive neural response that is used in the face of cognitive
challenge throughout the life span, rather than a process specific to old
age. The observation of visuospatial bootstrapping in young adults
under certain types of cognitive load (Allen et al., 2014) may also
represent a manifestation of scaffolding under cognitive challenge.
However, it is also possible that visuospatial bootstrapping reflects a
cognitive component such as the episodic buffer (Baddeley et al.,
2011) that is itself fairly resistant to aging.
As in any study of typical aging, it is unclear to what extent patterns
observed in this study can inform our understanding of age-related

degenerative cognitive decline. Future research might focus on un-
derstanding the mechanisms involved in the transition from normal to
pathological aging. This would have the potential to provide a theo-
retical basis for developing techniques to support older people in
remaining independent for longer and inform best practices when
working with such populations. Moreover, the use of spatially dis-
tributed displays to facilitate learning and memory of complex infor-
mation has a range of potentially useful applications especially in an
aging society with the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases on the
rise (Hort et al., 2010). Examining the cognitive processes underlying
the visuospatial bootstrapping task could also enable the development
of clinical tools for assessing LTM, visuospatial, and verbal integra-
tion in working memory. Finally, returning to working memory the-
ory, the episodic buffer has proven to be a useful and productive
addition to the working memory model (Baddeley, 2000; Baddeley et
al., 2011), but at present there is no adequate and straightforward tool
with which to assess it. It is possible that visuospatial bootstrapping
may be helpful in meeting this challenge.
