Would Safety-Net Expansions
Offset Reduced Access Resulting
From Lost Insurance Coverage?
Race/Ethnicity Differences
Increasing the availability of community health centers would help
reduce access disparities even if insurance coverage expands.
by Jack Hadley, Peter Cunningham, and J. Lee Hargraves
ABSTRACT: This study simulated whether increased community health center (CHC) fund-
ing under the Bush administration narrowed racial/ethnic gaps in access to care among
low-income people. Expanded CHC funding resulted in small increases in access to care,
more so for minorities than for whites. Spanish-speaking Hispanics had the largest improve-
ments in access in the simulation. However, minorities experienced bigger drops in insur-
ance coverage. The net result was no improvements in the access measures for Spanish-
speaking Hispanics and slight decreases in access for whites, English-speaking Hispanics,
and African Americans. Access gaps either remained the same or worsened slightly for Eng-
lish-speaking Hispanics and African Americans relative to whites. [Health Affairs 25, no. 6
(2006): 1679­1687; 10.1377/hlthaff.25.6.1679]
Racial and ethnic minorities consistently have higher rates of
uninsurance than whites, by almost twofold for African Americans and
roughly threefold for Hispanics.1 Recent data indicate that the gap is get-
ting larger. Between 2000 and 2004, the percentage of nonelderly people without
insurance increased 3.1 percentage points for African Americans, 2.2 percentage
points for Hispanics, and 1.8 percentage points for white non-Hispanics.2 Along-
side these significant differences, national reports on health care disparities docu-
ment minorities' consistently lower levels of access to care.3
Coinciding with increased uninsurance, the Bush administration expanded
federal funding for community health centers (CHCs) by more than 50 percent--
roughly $250 million--between 2001 and 2006.4 The president's 2006 State of the
Union address called for continued expansion, setting a goal of establishing a

CHC "in every high-poverty county in America that can support one."5 This policy
was motivated in part by the desire to maintain or expand access to care for people
who lose or cannot afford private insurance coverage, since CHCs typically use
grant funds to provide care to the uninsured. CHCs also disproportionately serve
minority patients: In 2001, 35 percent of CHC users were Hispanics, and 25 per-
cent were African Americans.6
This study estimates the effects of CHCs and insurance coverage on access to
care by race and ethnicity, and it simulates whether expanded funding for CHCs
narrowed the gaps in access to care between whites and minority groups. Since ra-
cial and ethnic minorities use CHCs more than non-Hispanic whites do, federal
investments in CHCs should narrow differences in access. However, a growing
gap in insurance coverage between whites and racial/ethnic minorities might frus-
trate this goal.
n Previous studies. Marsha Lillie-Blanton and Catherine Hoffman reviewed
four multivariate analyses of the role of health insurance coverage in explaining ra-
cial/ethnic disparities in access to health care.7 With one exception, these studies
found that differences in health insurance coverage between whites, Hispanics, and
African Americans accounted for a sizable share of the differences in having a usual
source of care. Two of these studies also examined the effects of area resources and
found that they explained very little of the difference in access to care.8 Another un-
published study also found only a weak relationship between a county's broadly de-
fined safety-net resources and access to care.9
These studies shared two major limitations: They used indirect measures of
safety-net capacity, and, more importantly, they did not account for possible endo-
geneity bias in both insurance coverage and safety-net capacity. Endogeneity bias re-
fers to the difficulty of disentangling the direction of causation between insurance
coverage, CHC capacity, and access to care. For example, CHCs might be more
likely to locate in areas with poor access or high rates of uninsurance, or greater lo-
cal CHC capacity might influence some people to forgo insurance coverage.
In previous work, Jack Hadley and Peter Cunningham showed that safety-net
availability, measured by the distance to the nearest safety-net provider, is in fact
endogenous and that failure to adjust for endogeneity understated the estimated
impact of safety-net proximity on access.10 Using an appropriate statistical
method, they found that greater proximity to safety-net providers has a statisti-
cally significant and positive effect on several measures of access to care.11
In a study of the effects of insurance coverage and safety-net capacity on having
a usual source of care, Cunningham and Hadley used an improved measure of
safety-net availability (total grant revenues received by federally qualified CHCs
within a five-mile radius of survey respondents) and treated both insurance cover-
age and safety-net capacity as endogenous.12 After adjusting for endogeneity bias,
their study concluded that both insurance coverage and safety-net capacity have
positive effects on having a usual source of care.

n Current analysis. The analysis on which we report here follows and extends
our prior work. We based our simulations on statistical models that treat both in-
surance coverage and safety-net capacity as endogenous variables but used an im-
proved measure of safety-net capacity: total CHC grant revenues per poor person
within a five-mile radius of survey respondents. This measure captured both the ab-
solute capacity of nearby CHCs and the potential demand for care from CHCs by
poor people. We extended this earlier work by allowing all effects to vary by race
and ethnicity and by distinguishing between English- and Spanish-speaking His-
panics (based on whether the interview was conducted in Spanish or English) in esti-
mating the access models and comparing the effects of coverage and CHC capacity.13
Study Data And Methods
n Data. The analysis used data from three rounds of the CTS survey, conducted
in 1998­99, 2000­01, and 2003. The CTS is a nationally representative telephone sur-
vey conducted primarily in sixty randomly selected communities in thirty-four
states and the District of Columbia.14 Since CHCs primarily serve low-income peo-
ple, the analysis sample was limited to nonelderly people with incomes below 300
percent of the federal poverty level. The total sample size is 47,992 people catego-
rized into four racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics interviewed in
English, Hispanics interviewed in Spanish, and African Americans.15 We distinguish
between English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanics because prior research indicates
that Spanish-speaking Hispanics have a much higher uninsurance rate, are much
more likely to be noncitizens, and generally have less access to public insurance or
jobs that offer private insurance than is true for English-speaking Hispanics.16 Span-
ish speakers might also be more likely than English speakers to use CHCs, which of-
ten provide on-site interpreters and might be more culturally sensitive.17
n Access measures and statistical estimation. We analyzed two measures of
access to care: whether the person has a usual source of care, and whether the person
had any ambulatory care visits with a health professional in the previous year. Hav-
ing a usual source of care is an important indicator of whether a person is likely to be
able to obtain care if needed, while having had at least one ambulatory care visit is a
marker for whether the person was able to realize a perceived need for care by actu-
ally seeing a health care provider.
CHC capacity is defined as the amount of CHC grant revenue per poor person
(family income less than 100 percent of poverty) within five miles of the survey re-
spondent.18 We identified all CHCs within five miles of each respondent using in-
formation on the latitudes and longitudes of CHCs' and survey respondents' five-
digit ZIP codes. We then summed the CHCs' grant revenues (obtained from the
Uniform Data System maintained by the Health Resources and Services Adminis-
tration, Bureau of Primary Health Care) within a five-mile radius of each survey
respondent as an indicator of CHCs' financial capacity to provide care to unin-
sured people.19 Total CHC grant revenue was then divided by the number of poor

people within the same radius, to adjust the capacity measure for the potential de-
mand for CHC services.
We simulated the effects of changes in CHC funding and insurance coverage on
access to care from the parameters of multivariate regression models that control
for the effects of several important sociodemographic characteristics: age, educa-
tion, self-reported general health status, marital status and the presence of chil-
dren, attitudes toward risk, and type of community (small metropolitan or non-
metropolitan versus large metropolitan). To allow the results to vary with race/
ethnicity, all of the models' independent variables were interacted with dummy
variables for race/ethnicity (English-speaking Hispanic, Spanish-speaking His-
panic, and African American relative to non-Hispanic white).20 We estimated the
models' parameters using instrumental variable estimation to test and adjust for
potential endogeneity bias.21
Study Findings
n Levels of access by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and CHC capacity.
Regardless of race, ethnicity, and the level of nearby CHC capacity, insured people
have better access to care than uninsured people (Exhibit 1). In no case, moreover, is
the level of access for the uninsured with a high level of CHC capacity greater than
for the insured with no nearby CHCs. Within each of the two insurance-status
groups, non-Hispanic whites tend to have the best levels of access, while Spanish-
speaking Hispanics have the worst.

Holding insurance status fixed, the association between the access measures
and the level of CHC capacity is more ambiguous. Among the uninsured, non-
Hispanic whites and English-speaking Hispanics with no CHCs within five miles
appear to have better access than similar people with high levels of CHC availabil-
ity. However, for Spanish-speaking Hispanics and African Americans, the propor-
tion with an ambulatory care visit increases monotonically as CHC capacity in-
creases. However, the usual-source-of-care measure suggests that there is little
difference between no CHC availability and a low level of CHC availability.
These ambiguities are indicative of endogeneity bias. Since CHCs are more
likely to locate in areas with poor access to care, the observed relationship be-
tween CHCs and access probably understates the true effect. The association be-
tween insurance status and access looks more clear-cut. However, its magnitude
could also be biased if people who have a strong preference for having a usual
source of care or who anticipate using medical services are more likely to seek in-
surance coverage.
n Multivariate regression estimates. The statistical tests indicated the pres-
ence of significant endogeneity bias and supported the use of instrumental variable
analysis to estimate the multivariate regression models. The resulting parameter es-
timates are generally much larger in magnitude than parameters estimated without
the adjustment for endogeneity bias.22 The multivariate results indicate (1) that the
uninsured are much less likely than the insured to report having either a usual
source of care or an ambulatory care visit in the past year, and (2) that people who
live in areas with greater CHC capacity are more likely than those not living in such
areas to have a usual source of care and an ambulatory care visit in the past year.
The multivariate results also imply that insurance status has the same effects on
access in each of the racial and ethnic groups. However, CHC capacity appears to
have a bigger impact on minorities' reporting that they have a usual source of care
than it does for white non-Hispanics. The CHC capacity measure shows smaller
differences across racial and ethnic groups in affecting ambulatory care visits: The
only statistically significant difference is between African Americans and non-
Hispanic whites.
n Simulations of changes in insurance status and CHC capacity. To provide
information about associations between variations in insurance status and CHC ca-
pacity and the relative magnitudes of changes in the access measures, we used the
multivariate regression models to simulate the effects of four hypothetical policy
changes: (1) reduce the uninsurance rate by 5 percent for each racial/ethnic group;
(2) eliminate uninsurance (enact universal coverage); (3) increase aggregate CHC
grants by about $250 million, which mimics the Bush administration's increase in
CHC funding between 2001 and 2004, and (4) increase uninsurance by amounts
similar to the national changes between 2000 and 2004 and simultaneously increase
CHC capacity by $250 million. (This fourth simulation approximates the national
experience since 2000 and addresses the primary policy question raised here.)

The simulations show that both reducing uninsurance and increasing CHC ca-
pacity would improve both measures of access (Exhibit 2). The effects are some-
what larger on the probability of reporting a usual source of care than on the prob-
ability of having an ambulatory care visit, and also larger for minorities than for
non-Hispanic whites. Thus, the simulations also suggest that with one exception,
both policies would reduce disparities in access between non-Hispanic whites
and racial/ethnic minorities. (The one exception is that an increase in CHC capac-
ity increases the probability of having an ambulatory care visit by the same
amount for English-speaking Hispanics as for non-Hispanic whites.)
Spanish-speaking Hispanics appear to benefit the most from both policies. If
uninsurance were eliminated, access would increase the most for Spanish-speak-
ing Hispanics because they by far have the highest initial level of uninsurance.
However, even these substantial improvements in access would reduce the gap be-
tween them and non-Hispanic whites by only about half.

The final simulation estimates the combined consequences of an increase in
uninsurance, which reduces access, and an increase in CHC capacity. The changes
in uninsurance and CHC capacity were set to approximate actual national experi-
ence between 2000 and 2004. The simulations indicate that the expansion of
CHC capacity generally offset the adverse effects on access of the increase in
uninsurance rates between 2000 and 2004. For Spanish-speaking Hispanics, the
CHC expansion appears to have fully offset the effect of increased uninsurance,
with no change in either of the two access measures. However, the simulations in-
dicate that the other racial and ethnic groups experienced small decreases in ac-
cess (­0.1 to ­0.3 percentage points).
Concluding Comments
This analysis suggests that policies to reduce uninsurance and expand CHC ca-
pacity will increase low-income people's access to care, as measured by having a
usual source of care and an ambulatory care visit in the past year. Moreover, mi-
nority groups' access appears to be more responsive to changes in insurance cover-
age and CHC capacity than non-Hispanic whites' access. Thus, if policy changes
were targeted equally to all low-income people, the gaps in access between whites
and nonwhites should be reduced. However, although eliminating uninsurance
would have a sizable impact on minorities' access levels, it would not eliminate ac-
cess gaps completely.
The simulations also suggest that the Bush administration's CHC expansion
might have offset much of the adverse effects on access of the recent increases in
uninsurance. However, it is important to emphasize that the measures analyzed in
this study represent only the most basic forms of access. Although they are impor-
tant indicators of access to primary and first-contact care, they might not capture
variations in access to specific types of care (such as specialists, prescription
drugs, expensive therapeutic procedures, or hospital care) or the total amount of
care received. Investigating the relationships between insurance status and CHC
capacity on these additional access measures is important for obtaining a com-
plete picture of the extent to which CHCs fully substitute for insurance coverage.
Another limitation is that the simulations did not distinguish between effects
in rural and urban areas. CHCs are less widely available in rural areas; when they
do exist, they tend to treat more privately insured and fewer Medicaid or unin-
sured people than urban CHCs.23 (In the data used in this analysis, only 13.4 per-
cent of nonmetropolitan residents lived within five miles of a CHC, compared
with 42.1 percent of metropolitan residents; among those within the five-mile ra-
dius, 20.5 percent of the nonmetropolitan sample were uninsured and 16.9 percent

were covered by Medicaid, compared with 29.8 percent uninsured and 25.6 per-
cent with public coverage in the metropolitan sample.) Thus, the impact of ex-
panded CHC funding in rural areas might be more sensitive to whether new
CHCs are established, compared to urban areas where existing CHC capacity
could be a more limiting factor.
It is also important to emphasize that the simulations of expanding CHC ca-
pacity were relatively crude and did not attempt to replicate the actual changes in
CHC capacity resulting from the Bush administration's increases in CHC funding.
Nor did the simulations distinguish between expansions of existing CHCs and
funding new CHCs in areas that do not have any. Future research should examine
the impacts on access to care in communities that specifically expanded CHC ca-
pacity under the Bush administration's policy, distinguishing between rural and
urban communities and between newly established CHCs and expansions of ex-
isting CHCs.
In spite of these limitations, the simulations illustrate the importance of adjust-
ing for the endogeneity bias, which tends to be inherent in nonrandomized obser-
vational data, when drawing policy implications from multivariate regression sta-
tistical analysis. Without the adjustment for endogeneity bias, the analysis would
have implied that CHC capacity does not have a significant and positive effect on
access, especially for racial and ethnic minorities. By using an appropriate statisti-
cal method, our analysis leads to the important policy implication that expanding
CHC capacity would be valuable for helping to reduce access disparities even if
insurance coverage expands. The findings also suggest that further expansions in
CHC capacity will be needed to maintain access to care if insurance coverage con-
tinues to decline.

though using different radii based on community characteristics would have been difficult, controlling for
whether the site was a large metropolitan site (greater than 200,000 population), small metro site, or
