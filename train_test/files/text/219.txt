Objectives. This study assesses whether grandchildren's moving into or out of grandparents' households affects grand-
parents' depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, and whether such effects vary by gender or race. It further examines
whether effects of surrogate parenting on grandparents' subjective well-being are direct or mediated through the impact of
surrogate parenting on other life changes, namely, health, work hours, income, socializing, and social supports.
Methods. The analyses rely on panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households, Waves 1 and 2. The sub-
sample consists of Black and White grandparents with grandchildren younger than age 18 (N = 1,789). Ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions and path analyses are used to identify direct and indirect effects of grandchildren's move into and out of
grandparents' household on change in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction (residualized gain scores).
Results. The data indicate that grandchildren's move into the household increases depressive symptoms among grandmoth-
ers. On the other hand, grandchildren's leaving the household leads to reduced well-being among grandfathers. Grandmothers
report less participation in church activities and more supports from friends and relatives after the grandchildren move in,
whereas grandfathers frequent bars/taverns more when grandchildren move in and reduce time spent with church activities and
paid work when grandchildren remain in the household.
Discussion. The findings suggest that effects of surrogate parenting differ by gender, and that they are partially contingent
on grandparents' vulnerabilities (marital status, education, and presence of childless dependent children in the household)
before grandchildren join the household. Mediating effects of other life changes are relatively small.
TN 1997,3.9 million or 5.5% of children were raised partly or
A exclusively by their grandparents (Casper & Bryson, 1998).
Grandparents who assume such surrogate parenting responsi-
bilities can be overwhelmed by the stresses and responsibilities
associated with this living arrangement. Among the problems
noted in previous research are health problems, financial diffi-
culties, declines in social activities, stresses in relations with
other family members, and a decline in subjective well-being
(for reviews, see Burton, Dilworth-Anderson, & Merriwether-
DeVries, 1995; Emick & Hayslip, 1996; Hirshorn, 1998;
Minkler & Roe, 1993; Pebley & Rudkin, 1999; Shore &
Hayslip, 1994).
Some studies show, for example, that surrogate parents may
suffer health problems because of either exhaustion and over-
load or the physical strains caused by child-rearing activities
(Jendrek, 1993; Minkler & Roe, 1993,1996; Minkler, Roe, &
Price, 1992; Roe, Minkler, & Saunders, 1995; Solomon &
Marx, 1999). However, one recent study (Pruchno, 1999) found
few effects of surrogate parenting on grandparents' health.
Another investigation shows few health differences between
grandmothers who live alone and those who are single and care
for grandchildren. Furthermore, differences between surrogate
and nonsurrogate grandmothers were more pronounced for per-
ceived health status than for other health measures (Solomon &
Marx, 1999).
Financial problems are quite common as well. Surrogate
grandparents carry the financial burdens associated with child-
rearing, which can be particularly costly if the grandchildren
suffer from physical or mental health problems. Some grand-
parents also have to reduce their work hours or (more rarely)
quit theirjobs to accommodate grandchildren, and many com-
plain about difficulties in obtaining funds through federal or
state programs (Aquilino & Supple, 1991; Chalfie, 1994;
Dowdell, 1995; Dressel & Barnhill, 1994; Minkler & Roe,
1993,1996; Mullen, 1996; Poe, 1992; Pruchno, 1999; Roe et
al., 1995; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998; Simon-Rusinowitz,
Krach, Marks, Piktialis, & Watson, 1996).
Another commonly mentioned problem is decline in social
contacts and insufficient social supports (Minkler & Roe, 1993;
Poe, 1992; Pruchno, 1999). Surrogate parents have little time left
for social encounters and often find that their friends, unencum-
bered by parenting responsibilities, have little understanding for
their predicaments. However, some grandparents may also en-
hance social contacts after becoming surrogate parents (Burnette,
1999). Although surrogate parents seek out various sources of in-
formal and formal supports, the supports they are able to secure
frequently are limited as well (Burnette, 1999; Jendrek, 1993;
Minkler & Roe, 1993; Szinovacz & Roberts, 1998).
There also is considerable evidence that surrogate parenting
affects grandparents' psychological well-being (Ellison, 1990;
Minkler & Roe, 1993, 1996; Shore & Hayslip, 1994; Straw-
bridge, Wallhagen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997). In their panel
study, Giarrusso, Feng, Wang, and Silverstein (1996) found no
significant overall effects of surrogate parenting on well-being,
but grandparents who became surrogate parents were more
likely than other grandparents to experience a decline in psy-
chological well-being over time. Using data from the National
Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), Minkler, Fuller-

SURROGATE PARENTINGAND GRANDPARENTS' WELL-BEING S377
Thomson, Miller, and Driver (1997) showed that grandparents
who had assumed "primary responsibility for grandchildren"
after the first wave of the NSFH scored higher on depressive
symptoms than other grandparents. In many cases, emotional
problems are attributed to life changes associated with surro-
gate parenting, to concerns about the adult children, or to health
and behavior problems of the grandchildren (Hayslip, Shore,
Henderson, & Lambert, 1998; Minkler & Roe, 1993, 1996).
Other problems noted in earlier studies include loss of social
status, less privacy, fatigue, changes in routines and overload,
and marital problems as well as family problems, such as lack
of supports or jealousy of other adult children (Aquilino &
Supple, 1991; Burton, 1992; Burton & DeVries, 1992; Burton
et al., 1995; Dowdell, 1995; Jendrek, 1993; Minkler et al.,
1992; Minkler & Roe, 1993,1996; Pearson, Hunter, Ensminger,
& Kellam, 1990; Poe, 1992; Pruchno, 1999; Roe, Minkler, &
Barnwell, 1994; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998; Shore &
Hayslip, 1994). When the adult children remain in the house-
hold, tensions over child rearing and household rules may fur-
ther contribute to grandparents' stress (Aquilino, 1991; Caldwell,
Antonucci, & Jackson, 1998; Harrigan, 1992; Jendrek, 1993;
Richardson, Barbour, & Bubenzer, 1991).
Nevertheless, grandparents also derive some benefits from
coresidence with grandchildren. Most often noted are: getting
another chance at parenting, companionship, a new lease on
life, strength through coping, enhanced feelings of self-worth,
and a sense of belonging (Aquilino, 1991; Aquilino & Supple,
1991; Burton, 1992; Burton & DeVries, 1992; Flaherty, Facteau,
& Garver, 1987; Giarrusso et al., 1996; Harrigan, 1992; Jendrek,
1993; Minkler & Roe, 1993; Poe, 1992; Pruchno, 1999; Roe et
al., 1994; Shore & Hayslip, 1994).
Taken together, these studies suggest that surrogate parenting
can take its toll on grandparents' health, income, employment,
or social contacts as well as on their psychological well-being.
However, several of these findings and their interpretation re-
quire further substantiation. First, it remains unclear whether
decline in surrogate parents' psychological well-being derives
directly from their surrogate parenting responsibilities or re-
flects the impact of surrogate parenting on other life changes
(health, finances, and social contacts). This distinction is not
only of theoretical but also of practical relevance. If changes in
subjective well-being can be primarily attributed to other life
changes brought about by surrogate parenting, then interven-
tions should focus on ameliorating surrogate parents' physical
health, finances, or social contacts and supports. However, if
subjective well-being is affected directly (i.e., independent of
other life changes), then additional intervention efforts will be
necessary to boost surrogate parents' mental health. Further-
more, because many previous studies relied on retrospective ac-
counts (Burton, 1992, 1996; Minkler & Roe, 1993; Pruchno,
1999), it is important to ascertain that observed changes in
grandparents' subjective well-being are indeed causally linked
to surrogate parenting and not attributable to other factors. In
addition, several previous studies relied on relatively homoge-
nous samples in regard to grandparents' gender (Burton, 1996;
Dilworth-Anderson, 1994; Dowdell, 1995; Pruchno, 1999; Roe
et al., 1994,1995; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998; Solomon &
Marx, 1999) and race (Burnette, 1999; Burton, 1992, 1996;
Dilworth-Anderson, 1994; Flaherty et al., 1987; Roe et al.,
1994, 1995). It is, therefore, important to assess whether surro-
gate parenting responsibilities have similar outcomes for grand-
mothers and grandfathers or for African American and White
grandparents.
Our aim is to expand on Minkler et al.'s (1997) analyses by
focusing on grandchildren's movement into and out of grand-
parents' household, by investigating effects of grandparents'
care for grandchildren on selected aspects of grandparents' life
(health, income, employment, social contacts, and social sup-
ports) as well as on their psychological well-being (depressive
symptoms, and life satisfaction), and by comparing effects of
surrogate parenting by gender and race.
Theoretical Model
The transition to surrogate parenting constitutes a stressful
life event that can be expected to exert a direct negative effect
on grandparents' psychological well-being, reflected in an in-
crease in depressive symptoms and a decline in life satisfaction
(George, 1990). In addition, grandchildren's presence in the
household has been linked to various other changes in grand-
parents' life, especially their physical health, work hours and
income, and social endeavors, changes that may be stressful in
themselves. Consequently, we also predict indirect negative ef-
fects of surrogate parenting on well-being through its influence
on these four life areas. Even though social supports may often
be insufficient, many grandparents are able to secure some sup-
ports in their efforts to raise their grandchildren; such supports
have been shown to buffer the impact of negative life events on
psychological well-being (Antonucci, 1990). We thus expect
grandparents who become surrogate parents to increase their
social supports and predict a positive relationship between in-
creased social support and subjective well-being.
In contrast, grandchildren's moving out of grandparents'
household is likely to enhance grandparents' well-being.
Although grandparents whose grandchildren leave the house-
hold may still maintain some responsibility for their grandchil-
dren, grandchildren's moving out of the household relieves
grandparents of their various, often stressful, experiences with
coresident grandchildren and, in some cases, also signifies the
resolution of problems in adult children's lives that led to the
surrogate parenting arrangement. These changes should mani-
fest themselves in a direct positive effect on grandparents' well-
being. To the extent that ending surrogate parenting also leads
to positive changes in grandparents' other life spheres (income,
work hours, etc.), it can further be expected to have indirect
positive effects on well-being. Although social supports specifi-
cally targeted to help grandparents cope with surrogate parent-
ing are likely to decline when the grandchildren move out, this
decrease is unlikely to reduce well-being. Thus, we expect no
indirect effect of grandchildren's leaving the household through
its impact on social supports.
Long duration of surrogate parenting may further enhance
grandparents' stress by forcing them into more permanent care
arrangements for the grandchildren such as reduction in work
hours or quitting theirjob. If this were the case, then grandchil-
dren's continued presence in the household would lead to a fur-
ther decline in grandparents' well-being (Solomon & Marx,
1999). It is, however, also conceivable that grandparents who
remain surrogate parents eventually adapt to the situation
(Shore & Hayslip, 1994). In this case, continued presence of
grandchildren in the household would either be unrelated to the
S378 SZINOVACZETAL.
well-being variables or enhance well-being (as a result of suc-
cessful coping). Because Solomon and Marx's (1999) large-scale
study indicates that duration of surrogate parenting enhances
grandparents' health problems, we predict that grandchildren's
staying in the household will lead to a further decline in grand-
parents' well-being.
Characteristics of the grandparents themselves, especially gen-
der and race, may condition the influence of surrogate parenting
on well-being. There is ample evidence that women take on most
care in families, so that one would expect effects of surrogate
parenting to be stronger for grandmothers than grandfathers.
Indeed, some research indicates that surrogate grandfathers
derive enhanced grandparent meaning from their involvement in
custodial care (Hayslip et al., 1998). Nevertheless, grandfathers
may assume some care responsibilities, and they may also be af-
fected by their wives' preoccupation with care of the grandchil-
dren (Jendrek, 1993). Thus, surrogate parenting is expected to
exert some influence on grandfathers as well, but the effects
should be more pronounced for grandmothers. Evidence fur-
ther suggests that surrogate parenting experiences differ by
race. Black grandparents may assume surrogate parenting re-
sponsibilities under more difficult circumstances (e.g., adult
children's drug problems or incarceration) than White grand-
parents, and they are also more likely than White grandparents
to enter this care arrangement under more disadvantaged so-
cioeconomic conditions (Minkler et al., 1992; Pruchno, 1999).
Both conditions could render Black grandparents more vulner-
able than White grandparents to the stresses of surrogate par-
enting. We thus hypothesize a stronger effect of surrogate par-
enting for Black grandparents, especially when socioeconomic
conditions are not controlled.
In addition, a variety of other potential risk factors may im-
pinge on grandparents' well-being. To the extent the data per-
mit, we control for such potential competing risks (changes in
marital status, in caregiving for other family members, and in
spouse's health). Other controls (age, marital status, education,
and household composition) adjust for differences in grandpar-
ents' vulnerability.
METHODS
Sample
The study relies on secondary analyses of the National
Survey of Families and Household (NSFH), a nationally repre-
sentative survey of 13,008 households at Time 1. Two waves of
data have been collected, one in 1987-1988 and the other in
1992-1994. Thus, the NSFH now provides longitudinal infor-
mation on diverse aspects of family life. Data for main respon-
dents were collected from a randomly selected household mem-
ber age 19 or older. Respondents were interviewed and also
completed a self-administered questionnaire. Interviews lasted
typically between 70 min and 2 hr. Spouses filled out a self-
administered questionnaire during Wave 1 and were inter-
viewed during Wave 2.
The NSFH is based on a multistage area probability sample
that was augmented by oversampling of minorities, one-parent
families, families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and recently
married persons. The oversample was achieved by doubling the
number of targeted households. First wave interview response
rates for the successfully screened households were 73.5% for
the main sample and 76.8% for the oversample, resulting in a
total sample of 13,008 respondents. (For a detailed description
of the study, see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988.) A total of
10,005 respondents completed the Wave 2 interviews, repre-
senting an attrition rate of 23.2%. The subsample used for the
present analyses was restricted to respondents who were house-
hold heads and had grandchildren younger than age 18 at Time
2 (no information on grandchildren other than their presence in
the household was collected at Time 1). Because extended liv-
ing arrangements among minorities may be culturally moti-
vated (Hirshorn, 1998; Kamo, 1998) and the number of minori-
ties other than African Americans (e.g., Hispanics, Asians, and
Native Americans) are too small for separate analyses, we re-
strict our analyses to Caucasian and African American grand-
parents. The number of participants for this subsample is 1,789
(unweighted).
To assess whether attrition may have an impact on results,
we compared grandparents who remained in the study with
those who dropped out on selected life conditions and well-
being variables at Time 1. These analyses reveal that, for the
subsample of grandparents used here, attrition is somewhat
more pronounced among the disadvantaged, that is, those who
are older, have poorer health, score lower on life satisfaction,
and score higher on depressive symptoms. This means that we
may underestimate effects of surrogate parenting because the
most vulnerable grandparents are somewhat underrepresented.
However, two-step Heckman selectivity tests (Heckman, 1979)
using unweighted data indicated no major effect of attrition on
our models. In addition, attrition effects should be limited be-
cause the weights used in the analyses adjusted for attrition as
well as oversampling and nonresponses.
Measures
Dependent variables.--Two measures of well-being were
used in the analysis: depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.
Depressive symptoms were assessed with a modified version of
the CES-D. The CES-D was designed to assess depressive
symptoms in the general population, is widely used in mental
health research, and has also been applied to older populations
(Hertzog, 1989; Lewinsohn, Fenn, Stanton, & Franklin, 1986;
Radloff, 1977). The CES-D version included in the NSFH con-
tains items pertaining to two (Affect and Somatic) of the usual
four CES-D subscales. Specifically, respondents were asked,
"Next is a list of ways you might have felt or behaved during
the past week. On how many days during the past week did
you: feel bothered by things that usually don't bother you, not
feel like eating, feel that you could not shake off the blues even
with help from family or friends, have trouble keeping your
mind on what you were doing, feel depressed, feel that every-
thing you did was an effort, feel fearful, sleep restlessly, talk
less than usual, feel lonely, feel sad, feel you could not get
going" (0 to 7 days). Factor analyses indicated that the CES-D
items included in the NSFH constitute one single dimension, a
finding further substantiated by reliability analyses (Cronbach's
a = .93 for Wave 1 and Wave 2). These values remained the
same regardless of whether missing values were imputed or
not. Because the items seemed to reflect a single dimension,
total depressive symptom scores were derived by adding item
scores for each wave.
SURROGATE PARENTINGAND GRANDPARENTS' WELL-BEING S379
To assess change in depressive symptoms between waves,
we derived unstandardized residuals from regressions of Wave
2 on Wave 1 scores (with no other controls). These residuals
reflect Wave 2 depressive symptoms net of Wave 1 depressive
symptoms and can, therefore, be interpreted as gain scores
(Allison, 1990; Kessler, 1977). Because panel data are subject
to correlated measurement error, we also performed confirma-
tory factor analyses to estimate Wave 1 and Wave 2 scores for
depressive symptoms, using the AMOS structural equation
program (Arbuckle, 1997). Because results derived from these
two methods of constructing scores for depressive symptoms
were quite similar, we relied on the raw scores. The residuals
from raw scale scores are easier to interpret and also allow
adjustments for sample stratification and clustering that are
typically not available in structural equation analyses pro-
grams. High scores indicate increases in depressive symptoms
over time.
The second well-being measure is life satisfaction.
Respondents were asked: "Taking all things together, how
would you say things are these days?" (1 = very unhappy, 7 =
very happy). Unstandardized residuals were used as indicators
of change in life satisfaction over time. In this case, high scores
reflect an increase in life satisfaction between waves. Means
and standard deviations for the dependent and independent vari-
ables are shown in Table 1.
Independent variables.--The major independent variables in
the model are surrogate parenting and grandparents' life
changes (health, employment, income, social supports, and so-
cial contacts).
Surrogate parenting was derived from the household rosters
included in both waves. Comparison of grandchildren's pres-
ence in the household at Time 1 and Time 2 resulted in the
following surrogate parenting variables, coded as dummy vari-
ables: grandchildren move in (no grandchildren in the household
at Time 1, and grandchildren in the household at Time 2),
grandchildren stay (grandchildren in the household at both
waves), and grandchildren move out (grandchildren in the
household at Time 1 but not at Time 2). Grandparents with no
grandchildren in the household at both waves served as the ref-
erence category. The distribution of grandparents by surrogate
parenting responsibility is shown in Table 2. Because adult chil-
dren and their children may also move to the (grand)parents'
household to take care of the grandparent, we attempted to ex-
clude these cases in the designation of surrogate parenting.
Unfortunately, the available data are insufficient to distinguish
between coparenting and other care arrangements in all cases.
Thus, a few cases that do not constitute surrogate parenting
may have been included.
Overall, 10.7% of grandparents had grandchildren in their
households at either wave. In over one half (52.3%) of these
cases grandchildren moved in between waves, in over one quar-
ter (28.3%) grandchildren moved out, and in 19.4% cases
grandchildren remained in the household over both waves.
Both waves of the NSFH included questions about respon-
dents' work hours. In Wave 1, total work hours were assessed,
whereas in Wave 2 respondents were asked separately about
work hours in their primary and secondaryjobs. Hours in these
jobs were combined to arrive at Time 2 work hours.
Health was measured with the question: "Compared to other
people your age, how would you describe your health?" (1 =
very poor, 5 = excellent).
Income was based on constructed measures provided in the
NSFH. These measures include both individuals' own personal
income as well as couple incomes. The income variable used in
the analyses combines these two measures. Specifically, re-

spondents' own income was used if the respondent was not
married at the time of the interview, and one half of the cou-
ple's income was used for married respondents. This procedure
provides more comparable data on not only respondents' living
standard but also on changes in their living standard over time
in cases of divorce, remarriage, or widowhood. Income for both
waves was logged.
The social support measures rely on questions about help re-
ceived from friends, parents, children, siblings, and other rela-
tives in any of the following areas: babysitting, transportation,
housework, and advice (yes/no). Because type of support (ad-
vice vs instrumental) and source (relatives or friends) may alle-
viate the stresses of surrogate parenting in different ways, we
used three different support measures: number of sources (chil-
dren, siblings, other relatives, and friends) providing advice
(range = 0-4), number of instrumental supports (babysitting,
housework and repairs, and transportation) from friends (range
= 0-3), and number of instrumental supports from any rela-
tives (range = 0-9).
The social contact variables available in the NSFH refer to
how often respondents socialized (spent a social evening) with
relatives, neighbors, or friends, how often they participated in
social events at their church or synagogue, how often they at-
tended church services, how often they went to a bar/tavern,
and how often they joined in group recreational activities. The
latter variable (group activities) had no impact on any of the
well-being variables and was not used in the final analyses.
Except for church attendance, scores for the social contact vari-
ables ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (several times a week). Church
attendance was measured in number of visits per year (range =
0-365). Initial analyses (ordinary and confirmatory factor analy-
sis, and reliability) showed that these items do not scale (e.g.,
Cronbach's a < .50). Thus, single-item measures were used.
Of primary interest for our analyses is whether the impact of
surrogate parenting on well-being is direct or mediated through
its effect on grandparents' health, employment, income, social
contacts, or social supports. Thus, change between waves is the
main focus. To measure change, we derived gain scores from
regressions in which the dependent variable was the selected
characteristic (income, health, etc.) at Time 2, and the sole in-
dependent variable was this same characteristic at Time 1. The
unstandardized residuals from these regressions can be inter-
preted as gain scores. These residuals were used as independent
or dependent variables in the analyses.
In addition, various control variables were included in the
analyses. They consist of major demographic and household
characteristics including gender, race, marital status, presence
of dependent childless children in the household (all coded as
dummy variables), age, and education. Dependent children are
defined as children younger than age 19. Furthermore, other
life changes that may influence respondents' well-being were
controlled. Changes in caregiving responsibilities for household
members were assessed on the basis of questions asking re-
spondents whether they provided care to disabled household
members or to persons outside the household. Those who re-
ported such caregiving responsibilities at Time 2 but not at
Time 1 were coded as having started caregiving. We also exam-
ined whether stopping caregiving (caregiving at Time 1 but not
at Time 2) affected well-being. Because there was no signifi-
cant effect, this variable was not used in the final analyses.
Marital status changes were represented in two dummy vari-
ables: whether respondents started a new relationship or ended
their marriage between waves. Multiple changes (e.g., a respon-
dent who got divorced and then remarried) would be reflected
in a score of 1 (yes) on both measures. In addition, changes in
their spouses' lives (work hours, or health) may influence re-
spondents' well-being. Preliminary analyses revealed that only
improvements in spouses' health contributed significantly to
changes in well-being. Because many grandparents are not
married, improvement in spouses' health had to be coded as a
dummy variable. In this case, the reference category combined
respondents whose spouses underwent no change with those
who were not married. This coding procedure is appropriate
when marital status is also controlled and essentially distin-
guishes respondents whose spouses underwent some change
from respondents who experienced no change (either because
spouse's health remained the same or because they were not
married). Other controls considered in initial analyses (change
in spouse's work hours, deaths of relatives, number of grand-
children outside the household, and presence of adult childless
children in the household) did not influence relationships be-
tween the major independent variables and well-being and were
not retained in thefinalmodels.
Many of the variables have missing values. Because a signifi-
cant reduction in sample size and biases in the data may have
resulted if all cases with missing values were excluded (King,
Honaker, Joseph, & Scheve, 1999; Little & Rubin, 1987), we
replaced missing values using the SPSS missing value analysis
program. Estimation of imputed values required several steps.
The first step was to examine the missing data patterns (Little
& Schenker, 1995). Little and Schenker's chi-square test for
missing completely at random (MCAR) showed a nonrandom
pattern at both Time 1 and Time 2. Given this nonrandom pat-
tern, pairwise or listwise exclusion of missing values is inap-
propriate. The imputed data were estimated with EM (expecta-
tion maximization) maximum likelihood algorithms. Because
missing value imputation can affect estimates of standard er-
rors, we used bootstrapping to estimate standard errors and con-
fidence intervals for variables with imputed values (Stata,
1997). The resulting estimates were essentially the same as
those derived from the original analyses. Consequently, signifi-
cance levels derived from the original estimates of standard er-
rors are reported. Intercorrelations among the independent vari-
ables were low to moderate, and multicollinearity is not a
problem, as indicated by an average variance inflation (VIF) of
1.35 (Fox, 1991). Statistical power for our models (N=610 un-
weighted for men, and N = 1,119 unweighted for women, with
25 predictor variables) approaches 1.00 for an alpha of .05 and
an/?2 of .10.
Analyses
The analyses relied on ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-
sions. Estimation of standard errors was adjusted for complex
surveys (Stata, 1997). Because standardized coefficients cannot
be derived from analyses that adjust for sample design (Stata,
1997), the betas shown in the tables are based on OLS regres-
sions with robust standard errors. Three models are shown in
the tables: The first model includes gender, race, and the surro-
gate parent variables; the second model includes all variables;
and the third model includes all variables except for selected
SURROGATE PARENTINGAND GRANDPARENTS' WELL-BEING S381
controls (age, marital status, education, and presence of depen-
dent childless children in the household). Other models (e.g.,
excluding life changes) were also estimated but are not shown
in the tables. We assessed variations in the effects of surrogate
parenting by gender and race through interaction terms (Race
X Surrogate Parenting, and Gender X Surrogate Parenting).
Because differences in the gender distribution by race may con-
found race and gender interactions, race interactions were tested
separately for all respondents and for female participants. The
number of surrogate grandfathers was too small to test for race
differences. To examine whether the effects of surrogate parent-
ing are mediated by its impact on work hours, health, social
contacts, income, or supports, path analysis (Alwin & Hauser,
1981) was used. Path analysis decomposes the effect of an in-
dependent variable into its direct effect (i.e., the coefficients de-
rived from regressing depressive symptoms on the surrogate
parenting and selected control and mediating variables) and its
indirect effect (derived from the cross-product of the effect of
surrogate parenting on the mediating variables--health, in-
come, etc.--and the effects of the mediating variables on de-
pressive symptoms). Indirect effects are deemed significant
only if both coefficients (the correlation between the surrogate
parenting and the mediating variables as well as the correlation
between the mediating and dependent variables) are significant.
RESULTS
The results are presented in three sections. We first address
the impact of surrogate parenting on selected life changes. Then
we discuss effects of surrogate parenting on depressive symp-
toms and on life satisfaction, followed by the decomposition
into direct and indirect effects.
Life Changes
We expected that surrogate parenting should lead to declines
in work hours, income, health, and social contacts and to in-
creases in social supports. The data only partially support these
hypotheses (see Table 3). Men but not women (gender interac-
tion b = 13.22, p < .05) experience a significant decline in work
hours when grandchildren stay in the household, whereas grand-
children's moves into or out of the household have no impact on
work hours. At the same time, continued stays of grandchildren
in the household apparently are associated with an increase in
income for men but not women (gender interaction b = -2.22,
p < .05). There are no significant effects of the surrogate parent-
ing variables on changes in health.
Several of the social contact variables (church attendance,
participation in social church events, socializing with neigh-
bors, and going to a bar or tavern) are affected by surrogate par-
enting responsibilities. Grandmothers who assume surrogate
parenting report a decline in church-related activities (both at-
tendance and socializing), whereas grandfathers' church activi-
ties are not significantly influenced by surrogate parenting.
However, the gender interaction is not significant. On the other
hand, grandfathers report reduced participation in social church
events when grandchildren stay in the home and an increase in
such activities when the grandchildren move out. Again, the
gender interactions are not significant. In the case of church at-
tendance, there is a significant race interaction for women (b =
31.15, /? < .05), indicating that it is primarily White women
who reduce their church attendance when grandchildren move
into their homes. Socializing with neighbors increases among
women but not men whose grandchildren moved out of the
household (gender interaction b = .93, p < .05). Grandfathers

apparently increase visits to bars both when grandchildren
move in and when they move out, whereas grandmothers re-
duce bar visits when the grandchildren leave. Both gender in-
teractions are significant (b = -.51, p < .05 for grandchildren
moving in; b = -.57, p < .05 for grandchildren moving out).
As expected, surrogate parenting also influences social sup-
ports. Especially women report enhanced instrumental supports
by friends and relatives when grandchildren move in as well as
a decline in these supports when the grandchildren leave the
household. The gender interactions are, however, not signifi-
cant. Men seem more prone than women to receive additional
advice from friends or relatives when grandchildren move into
the household (gender interaction b = -.28, p < .05), but the ef-
fect itself is not significant.
Weil-Being (Direct Effects)
According to our theoretical model, grandchildren's moving
into and remaining in the household should reduce well-being,
whereas grandchildren's leaving the household should enhance
well-being. The data confirm that the beginning of surrogate
parenting (grandchildren moving in) takes its toll especially on
grandmothers' well-being. As shown in Table 4, women's de-
pressive symptoms increase when grandchildren move into the
household. Further analyses (not shown in the table) suggest
that starting surrogate parenting for grandchildren with neither
parent in the household is particularly detrimental to grand-
mothers' well-being as indicated by depressive symptoms (b =
5.32, (3 = .08, p > .05 for grandchildren with parents moving in;
fc=11.75,p = .ll,/?<.01 for grandchildren without parent
moving in for Model 1 in Table 4). However, only a few of the
NSFH grandmothers fall into the latter category (N = 19).
Although similar effects of grandchildren's move into the
household do not appear for grandfathers, the gender interac-
tions are not significant.
Overall, long-term stays of grandchildren in the household
do not appear to significantly induce more depressive symp-
toms in grandparents. However, additional analyses (not shown
in Table 4) suggest that continued presence of grandchildren
with their parent in the household does enhance grandmothers'
depressive symptoms (b = 10.99, (3 =. 11, p < .01 for Model 1

in Table 4). Once again, these data rely on a very small group
of grandmothers (N = 22).
Contrary to the hypothesis, we do not find a significant de-
cline in depressive symptoms when grandchildren move out.
Indeed, grandfathers apparently experience an increase in de-
pressive symptoms when their grandchildren leave. In this case,
the gender interaction is significant (b = 10.53, p < .01 for
Model 2 in Table 4). None of the effects of surrogate parenting
differ significantly by race.
Results for the effect of surrogate parenting on life satisfac-
tion (see Table 5) confirm that grandchildren's move into the
household reduces grandparents' well-being. Grandparents who
became surrogate parents between the two NSFH waves report
a significant decline in life satisfaction. This effect does not dif-
fer by gender or race. Once again, wefindno overall significant
effect of long-term stays of grandchildren in the household but
a significant decline in life satisfaction when grandchildren and
their parent remain in the household (b = -.48, (3 = -.03, p <
.05; data not shown in the table). The influence of grandchil-
dren's leaving the household is in the same direction as for de-
pressive symptoms (a decline in life satisfaction for men, and
an increase for women) but fails to reach significance. None of
these effects remain significant when other life changes and the
controls are included in the model.
Weil-Being (Indirect Effects)
In addition to these direct effects, our theoretical model pre-
dicts indirect effects of surrogate parenting through its impact on
work hours, health, income, social contacts, and social supports.
As noted earlier, a significant indirect effect requires significant
relationships between the independent variable (surrogate par-
enting) and the mediating variable (e.g., work hours) as well as
between the mediating variable and the dependent variable.
These requirements are only met for church attendance and
participation in social church events. However, in both cases the
indirect effects are quite small. Using an initial model that ex-
cludes both church attendance and participation in social church
events, we estimated direct and indirect effects separately for
these two variables. For grandchildren's move into the house-
hold, the total effect on grandmothers' depressive symptoms is
.0950 (beta). When church attendance is added to the model,
the direct effect is .0938 and the indirect effect through church
attendance is .0013. For the alternative model with participation
in social church events, the direct effect of grandchildren's

move into the household is .0996, and the indirect effect
through participation in social church events is -.0046. Thus,
increases in grandmothers' depressive symptoms on becoming
surrogate parents are very slightly enhanced through decreased
church attendance. As noted earlier, this seems to apply mostly
to White women. On the other hand, participation in social
church events seems to exert a buffering function as indicated
by the negative indirect effect, that is, participation in social
church events slightly reduces the effect of surrogate parenting
on depressive symptoms. There are no significant indirect ef-
fects for life satisfaction.
CONCLUSION
The main purpose of our analyses was to determine whether
grandchildren's movement into and out of grandparents' house-
holds influences selected grandparent characteristics as well
as their psychological well-being. In addition, we assessed
whether the influence of surrogate parenting is direct or medi-
ated through selected life changes and whether it differs by gen-
der and race.
Our data provide only limited evidence that surrogate parent-
ing brings about significant changes in grandparents' lives (at
least those life spheres considered here). Although several char-
acteristics (e.g., work hours and religious activities) relate sig-
nificantly to surrogate parenting, the effects are so small ((3 <
.10) that one can hardly speak of a major impact. The only ex-
ceptions are increased bar/tavern visits among grandfathers (P
= .11) and increased instrumental supports from relatives
among grandmothers who started surrogate parenting (P = .16).
Apparently grandmothers are able to secure help, especially
from relatives, when grandchildren move into the household.
As grandfathers' experience with surrogate parenting is typi-
cally as spouses (82% of those who started surrogate parenting
are married), their enhanced bar/tavern visits could signify an
SURROGATE PARENTINGAND GRANDPARENTS' WELL-BEING S385
escape from their homes once grandchildren move in. These
findings contrast with some earlier studies (Burton, 1992;
Jendrek, 1993; Minkler & Roe, 1993,1996) that report a deteri-
oration in various life spheres on becoming surrogate parents
but are in line with other research that also found little impact
of surrogate parenting on health or work hours (Pruchno, 1999;
Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998). Potential effects of surrogate
parenting on grandparents' lives most likely are contingent on
the circumstances under which grandparents assume this re-
sponsibility. Although many earlier studies focused on surro-
gate parenting under particularly difficult circumstances (e.g.,
drug abuse by the parents, or incarceration; see Dressel &
Barnhill, 1994; Hirshorn, 1998; Minkler etal., 1992), larger
data sets such as the NSFH or Pruchno's (1999) study probably
include a greater variety of surrogate parents. Because the
NSFH does not contain information on the reasons for grand-
children's presence in the household, we cannot determine
whether grandparents who assume surrogate parenting under
particularly difficult circumstances experience more adverse ef-
fects on their health, finances, or social contacts. Furthermore,
sample selection bias and attrition may have eliminated some
individuals who experienced the most detrimental effects of
surrogate parenting.
Our second research question addressed the influence of sur-
rogate parenting on grandparents' psychological well-being.
Although our results corroborate earlier research indicating a
decline in well-being among grandmothers who assume surro-
gate parenting (Ellison, 1990; Minkler & Roe, 1993, 1996;
Shore & Hayslip, 1994; Strawbridge et al., 1997), the effects
are again quite small. Methodological features of our study (the
use of residualized gain scores, and the skewed distribution of
grandparents with and without surrogate parenting responsibili-
ties in the NSFH) are likely to produce small effects. For exam-
ple, other stressful life events (other than changes in health)
such as changes in marital status or beginning of caregiving ac-
tivities yield similar small effects. Nevertheless, methodological
issues alone are unlikely to account for our results. Several
other issues may also play a role. Once again the composition
of surrogate parents in the NSFH may contribute to smaller ef-
fects. Furthermore, surrogate parenting prevails among already
disadvantaged population groups (Fuller-Thomson, Minkler, &
Driver, 1997; Szinovacz, 1998). These groups may experience a
deterioration in various life spheres and in well-being over time
regardless of surrogate parenting responsibilities. In smaller
studies it is typically not feasible to control for such influences.
Comparisons of the models in Tables 4 and 5 (and additional
models not shown in the tables) indicate that controlling for
major demographic characteristics (age, marital status, educa-
tion, and presence of dependent children in the household)
reduces the impact of surrogate parenting on well-being in the
case of life satisfaction to a nonsignificant level. It is conceivable
that grandparents attribute decreased well-being to the assump-
tion of surrogate parenting even though other factors may be at
least partially responsible. Strawbridge et al. (1997) reported,
for example, that most grandparent caregivers suffered from
poor health and other stressful life conditions well before they
became surrogate parents. However, similar to our study, de-
pressive symptoms increased after the assumption of surrogate
parenting. In addition, previous research indicates that grand-
parents also derive psychological benefits from surrogate par-
enting (Burton, 1992; Giarrusso et al., 1996; Jendrek, 1993;
Pruchno, 1999; Shore & Hayslip, 1994). The well-being vari-
ables included in the NSFH would reflect both positive and
negative effects of surrogate parenting, resulting in overall
smaller effects (i.e., positive and negative effects cancel each
other out to some extent).
Little is known about grandfathers who are surrogate parents
(or who are married to grandmothers who assume surrogate
parenting functions). Although grandchildren's move into the
household seems to exert some stresses on grandfathers (sug-
gested by nonsignificant gender interactions and grandfathers'
more frequent visits to bars/taverns after grandchildren move
in), grandchildren's presence also appears to have some benefi-
cial effects on grandfathers' well-being. This is indicated by an
increase in depressive symptoms when the grandchildren leave
the household. If, as some research suggests (Minkler & Roe,
1993; Spitze & Ward, 1998), grandfathers do not become
strongly involved in the care of custodial grandchildren, they
may derive benefits (e.g., companionship, or a new familial
focus, especially in the case of a dissatisfactory marital relation-
ship) from grandchildren's presence and miss these benefits
when the grandchildren move out. Hayslip et al. (1998)
showed, for example, that custodial grandfathers attach a more
positive meaning to the grandparent role than both noncustodial
grandfathers and custodial grandmothers. Furthermore, custo-
dial grandfathers with low-problem grandchildren scored
higher on psychosocial satisfaction than their female counter-
parts. Their more detached role in childrearing (Baranowski,
1985, 1990) also may shield grandfathers from emotional up-
heaval created by adult children's or grandchildren's problems,
as indicated by their tendency to seek relief in out-of-the home
entertainment (visits to bars/taverns).
We find no significant race differences in the influence of
surrogate parenting on well-being. However, because the cir-
cumstances under which grandparents assume surrogate par-
enting responsibilities vary by race (e.g., Black grandmothers
are more likely than White grandmothers to have grandchildren
without their parents in the home), this certainly does not mean
that the experience of surrogate parenting does not differ by
race. For example, African American grandparents may assume
surrogate parenting under more difficult circumstances but be
more able than White grandparents to secure and maintain so-
cial supports that buffer the effect of surrogate parenting on
well-being (Scott & Black, 1994). The small number of surro-
gate parents in our data also may obscure race differences.
We further explored the mediating effect of other life
changes on relationships between surrogate parenting and well-
being. Although path analyses reveal only marginal mediating
effects, the trends suggested by the data are somewhat more
complex. As already noted, surrogate parenting covaries with
demographic characteristics (e.g., marital status and education),
which also predict changes in psychological well-being over
time. This implies that some surrogate parents may be particu-
larly vulnerable to a deterioration both in various life spheres
and in their well-being over time. Because we controlled for
these demographic characteristics in our analyses, we elimi-
nated potential spurious relationships between such other life
changes and well-being. Moreover, comparisons of Models 1
and 3 in Tables 4 and 5 reveal that inclusion of health, income,
employment, and social contacts and supports (without the de-
S386 SZINOVACZETAL.
mographic variables) does reduce the effect of surrogate parent-
ing on well-being. This trend is more pronounced for life satis-
faction but also applies to depressive symptoms. This would
suggest that some of the impact of surrogate parenting on well-
being is indeed attributable to a deterioration in these character-
istics. However, it appears to be the cumulative effect of small
decreases in several characteristics rather than mediation
through one or two specific characteristics that accounts for our
findings.
Because our results differ to some extent from those docu-
mented in earlier studies, it is essential to assess limitations in
our data and other factors that may account for such discrepan-
cies. Large surveys such as the NSFH rarely include the in-
depth information that can be obtained through smaller and
more qualitative studies. For instance, we lack information on
the reasons why grandchildren moved into the household, be-
havioral and other problems exhibited by the grandchildren,
conflicts with the grandchildren's parents, or additional out-
come variables that may distinguish between benefits and costs
of surrogate parenting. In addition, grandmothers with severe
problems may have been particularly likely to refuse participa-
tion in a national survey and were more prone to attrition, so
that the most vulnerable groups are probably underrepresented.
The small number of surrogate parents in the sample and attri-
tion of the most vulnerable groups may have resulted in overly
conservative estimates of surrogate parenting effects. It is also
possible that the circumstances leading to surrogate parenting
may have already undermined grandparents' well-being before
the actual transition to surrogate parenting. Such changes would
not be evident in an analysis that focuses on change over time.
The relatively long time lag between the NSFH waves also may
contribute to our results. Grandparents may adjust to their sur-
rogate parenting responsibilities over time. Initial declines in
grandparents' situation immediately after assuming surrogate
parenting which are followed by improvement over time as
grandparents adapt to their new circumstances would again
diminish the total effect shown in these two-wave data. Mea-
surement issues also may have affected our results. Several mea-
sures used here (e.g., health, and life satisfaction) rely on single
items with questionable reliability.
Although data limitations may be responsible for some of
our findings, the design of earlier studies could also have con-
tributed to their results. Many previous studies focused on spe-
cial groups of surrogate parents, especially low-income Black
grandmothers whose adult children experienced severe prob-
lems such as drug addictions, imprisonment, or life-threatening
illness (Burton, 1992; Dilworth-Anderson, 1994; Dressel &
Barnhill, 1994; Minkler & Roe, 1993). Because these grand-
mothers are already vulnerable, they may be more affected by
surrogate parenting than grandparents covered by a representa-
tive national survey. In addition, many of the samples used in
earlier investigations were recruited from support groups for
grandparents raising grandchildren or from diverse social agen-
cies (e.g., see Hayslip et al., 1998; Minkler & Roe, 1993). Once
again, this may have led to a bias favoring those grandparents
who experience pronounced problems or those least able to
deal with surrogate parenting responsibilities. In addition, the
reliance on retrospective accounts may obscure causal relation-
ships (Kosloski, McGlinn Datwyler, & Montgomery, 1994). It
is quite possible that grandmothers may attribute diverse prob-
lems to their surrogate parenting situation even though these
problems predate this living arrangement or derive from other
factors such as poverty. These differences in study designs may
very well account for discrepancies in findings. If this is the
case, then the severe problems associated with surrogate par-
enting in some earlier studies cannot be generalized to the total
population of custodial grandparents. Rather, the consequences
of surrogate parenting responsibilities seem to be context
dependent.
In view of the relatively large proportion of surrogate parents
especially among minorities (Casper & Bryson, 1998; Fuller-
Thomson et al., 1997; Szinovacz, 1998), more research is
clearly needed to reconcile the findings from this and other
studies. Particularly useful would be representative and longitu-
dinal studies of grandparents that include in-depth measures of
psychological well-being, indicators of life quality such as
health, employment, and social contacts, and detailed informa-
tion on the circumstances leading to the surrogate parent ar-
rangement as well as on the specific problems encountered by
the grandparents and the grandchildren. Relationships between
the grandparents and the grandchildren's parents (regardless of
whether they reside in the household) should also be investi-
gated. Such studies should be conducted in relatively short in-
tervals over a prolonged time period to capture both the initial
adjustment problems during the transition to surrogate parent-
ing and the grandparents' adaptation over time. In addition,
grandmothers and grandfathers (and perhaps other family mem-
bers such as adult and dependent children in the household) as
well as divergent racial or ethnic groups should be participants
in such research. Such a broader family systems perspective
would enable researchers to identify the impact of surrogate
parenting on divergent family members and to analyze how
family members share (or do not share) care for the grandchil-
dren. In addition, careful assessment of the conditions (e.g.,
adult children's presence in the home, socioeconomic and
health status before becoming a surrogate parent, reasons for
surrogate parenting, grandchildren's problems, and extent of
care) that promote or hinder adaptation to surrogate parenting
would be particularly helpful to identify reasons for gender and
race differences and to develop successful interventions and
programs.
