Abstract:
We study differences in the price paid for liquidity across banks using price data at
the individual bank level. Unique to this paper, we also have data on individual
banks' reserve requirements and actual reserve holdings, thus allowing us to gauge
the extent to which a bank is short or long liquidity. We find that the price a bank
pays for liquidity depends on the liquidity positions of other banks, as well as its
own. There is evidence that liquidity squeezes occasionally occur and short banks
pay more the larger is the potential for a squeeze. The price paid for liquidity is
decreasing in bank size and small banks are more adversely affected by an increased
potential for a squeeze. Contrary to what one might expect, banks in formal liquidity
networks do not pay less.

Non technical summary
A well functioning market for liquidity is essential for the efficiency of the broader
financial markets. It is used by central banks to control short term rates and it
underpins the business of banking. It is also linked directly to securities markets
through the role of securities as collateral in a variety of operations and transactions.
An illustration is offered by the ongoing financial crisis, in which the entire global
banking and financial system seems to have been put at risk as liquidity has been
drying up. Many banks have already been bailed out and, since the summer of 2007,
central banks around the world have stepped in with extraordinary and emergency
injections of liquidity to help stabilize markets. Despite its importance, relatively
little is known about the market for liquidity, especially at a disaggregated level.
This paper sheds light on the workings of this market by studying how much banks
bid and pay for liquidity in 78 consecutive repo auctions by the Eurosystem in the
period between June 2000 and December 2001. The paper finds that the price of
liquidity systematically depends on bank characteristics and market conditions.
Specifically, our findings are consistent with the existence of periodically occur-
ring liquidity squeezes. A greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks is
associated with a rise in the price of liquidity, relative to the benchmark. Fur-
thermore, the shorter a bank is the more adversely it is affected by an increase in
imbalance, ceteris paribus. Since the sample period of this paper is a time of relative
normalcy in the interbank markets, this shows that liquidity squeezes are not just
a crisis phenomenon.
We also find a systematic relation between bank size and the price of liquidity.
Controlling for a variety of factors, we find that larger banks pay less than do
smaller banks. This effect is even more pronounced when there is an increase in
the imbalance of the liquidity positions. Smaller banks thus appear to be more
vulnerable to a liquidity squeeze, ceteris paribus. This may also help explain why
smaller banks tend to be less short than larger banks prior to refinancing operations.
Finally, we find that that membership in a formal relationship lending network
does not reduce the price a bank pays for liquidity. German savings and cooperative
banks, which formally belong to these networks, do not pay less than other banks,
which are not part of these networks. Cooperative banks even bid and pay more
than other banks. This gives rise to the notion that these formal networks may
induce banks to free-ride on the efforts of other banks in the network.

einzelner Banken. Dieses Papier beleuchtet das Funktionieren des Geldmarktes,
indem es das Verhalten einzelner Banken am Markt analysiert. Es untersucht, wie
viel die einzelnen deutschen Banken in den 78 aufeinanderfolgenden Repo-Auktionen
des Eurosystems zwischen Juni 2000 und Dezember 2001 geboten und letztlich f¨

The Price of Liquidity:
Bank Characteristics and Market Conditions
1 Introduction
A well functioning market for liquidity is essential for the efficiency of the broader
financial markets. It is used by central banks to control short term rates and it
underpins the business of banking. It is also linked directly to securities markets
through the role of securities as collateral in a variety of operations and transactions.
An illustration is offered by the ongoing credit-crunch, or so-called "sub-prime cri-
sis", where the entire global banking and financial system seems to have been put at
risk as liquidity has been drying up.1 Many banks have already been bailed out and,

its importance, relatively little is known about the market for liquidity, especially
at a disaggregated level. This paper sheds light on the workings of this market by
studying the price individual banks pay for liquidity and how this varies with bank
characteristics and market conditions. An important finding is that the price a bank
pays for liquidity is affected by the liquidity position of other banks, as well as its
own. This is especially significant since our sample period is taken from a time of
relative normalcy, well before the onset of the current crisis.
As for most other goods and assets, the market for liquidity consists of primary
and secondary markets. In this paper, we study primary market prices. In particu-
lar, we study the prices, or rates, German banks pay for liquidity in the Eurosystems'
main refinancing operations, which are the main source of liquidity in the euro area.
During the sample period, June 2000 to December 2001, the average operation in-
jected 84 billion euros of two-week money, against collateral. Over the crisis period,
other central banks such as the Fed and the Bank of England have introduced similar
operations to allow banks to obtain liquidity against an expanded set of collateral.
The Eurosystems' operations are organized as discriminatory auctions (pay your
bid), which means that different banks end up paying different prices, as a function
of their bids. Because we have all bids made by each bank over time, we can also
study banks' willingness to pay. Thus, since each auction provides us with a set of
bids and prices at one point in time, these auctions constitute a perfect setting for
studying the willingness to pay and the actual price paid for liquidity by different
banks.
Our analysis is concerned with potential imperfections in the market for liquidity.
The first hypothesis we examine is that liquidity squeezes occur from time to time
and, as a consequence, the shorter banks are relative to their liquidity needs, the
more they are willing to pay for liquidity, and the more they end up paying [as
suggested by Nyborg, Bindseil, and Strebulaev (2002)]. While there have been
previous studies using bidder level data from ECB operations [Nyborg et al (2002),
2
Linzert, Nautz, and Bindseil (2007), Craig and Fecht (2007)],2 none of these are able
to directly test this hypothesis because they lack data on banks' liquidity positions.
Unique to this paper, we have data on individual banks' reserve positions relative
to what they are required to hold with the central bank. We use this to construct
a measure of imbalance in the market. This is motivated by the theoretical work of
Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004) who show that an increase in the positional spread
between longs and shorts gives rise to more aggressive bidding in the auction, since
it increases the costs and benefits from a squeeze in the interbank market to shorts
and longs, respectively. The data confirms that an increase in imbalance leads to
more aggressive bidding and higher prices paid for liquidity.3 We also find that the
premium paid per unit that a bank is short is larger when the imbalance is larger.
These findings are consistent with the view that squeezes occur in the market for
liquidity and that consequently there is a cost associated with relying on the markets
to cover liquidity needs.
Our results relate to the literature on banking and liquidity spawned by Bryant
(1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and in particular on papers studying the
functioning of the interbank market [e.g. Bhattacharya and Gale (1987), Donald-
son (1992), Bhattacharya and Fulghieri (1994), Allen and Gale (2000), and Freixas,
Parigi, and Rochet (2000)].4 Bhattacharya and Gale (1987) argue that aggregate
liquidity shortfalls can occur as a result of banks free-riding on each other in pro-
viding liquidity to the interbank market. In the euro zone, however, the ECB solves
this particular problem through its policy of adjusting the size of its operations to
match the aggregate liquidity need of the entire banking system (ECB, 2002). But
this also means that liquidity in the euro zone is tight. If one bank has more than
2Breitung and Nautz (2001) study ECB fixed rate tenders, which were run until June 2000. In
these operations, bidding banks submit quantity bids, with the rate being pre-announced by the
ECB. Hartmann, Manna, and Manzanares (2001) provide an overview of euro money markets.
3This also bears relation to Furfine's (2000) finding that there is a link between interbank
payment flows and the federal funds rate.

it needs, another must have less. This gives rise to the possibility of short squeezes,
and our results indicate that this indeed occurs from time to time. This has wider
implications. The possibility of being squeezed may, for example, reduce banks
propensity to extend credit and thus lead to underinvestment in real assets. The
extra cost of liquidity arising from the possibility of squeezes may also impact on
asset prices, perhaps along the lines modelled by Allen and Gale (1994 and 2004) or
Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008), and contribute towards commonality in liquid-
ity across different securities and asset classes [Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Roll
(2000), Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001), Huberman and Halka (2001), Chordia, Sarkar,
and Subrahmanyam (2005)].
The second broad hypothesis we examine is that the price paid for liquidity is af-
fected by bank characteristics such as size and type. Allen, Peristiani, and Saunders
(1989) find that there are differences in purchase behavior among differently sized
banks in the federal funds market [see also Furfine (1999)]. The extant literature on
the ECB's operations suggests that bank size affects the price of liquidity [Nyborg
et al (2002), Linzert et al (2007), and Craig and Fecht (2007)], but again, these pa-
pers do not control for banks' liquidity positions.5 Bank size may matter because of
economies of scale and scope. A larger bank may have better access to the interbank
markets, for example because it has a larger network of regular counterparties or
because it has a wider range of collateral. It may also be less exposed to liquidity
shocks because it is more diversified, along the lines discussed by Kashyap, Rajan,
and Stein (2002). A larger bank may also be willing to put more resources into
liquidity management, since it has more to gain from a reduction in the per unit
5Nyborg et al (2002) are the first to provide evidence suggesting that the price paid for liquidity
in ECB operations is related to bank size. However, they use quantity demanded in the operations
as a proxy for size rather than balance sheet data. In their analysis of size, they also do not control
for other bank characteristics or market conditions. Their main objective lies elsewhere. Craig and
Fecht (2007) control for other factors, including bank type, but do not benchmark the rate paid
by banks in the operations by the contemporaneous interbank rate. Linzert et al (2007) study the
longer term operations.

cost of liquidity.
Our results confirm that size matters; large banks pay less for liquidity in the
primary market. The average auction has a price differential between the highest
and lowest paying banks of 11.5 bp. Some of this is related to size. The 5% small-
est banks pay in excess of 2 basis points (bp) more than the 1% largest banks, on
average across auctions. To get an idea of the relative magnitude of these numbers,
the average volatility of the two-week interbank rate on main refinancing operation
days is 5.3 bp and the average rate paid in the primary market is 1.2 bp below the
contemporaneous rate in the secondary market. Bank size remains highly significant
when we control for a variety of other bank characteristics and market conditions,
including banks' liquidity positions. Documenting that large banks indeed have a
lower cost of liquidity is important because it points to a source of competitive ad-
vantage to size in banking.6 We also find that bank size interacts with our imbalance
measure to affect the cost of liquidity; as imbalance grows, so does the extra cost
of liquidity to smaller banks. Thus, smaller banks appear to be more vulnerable to
liquidity squeezes.
The third hypothesis we examine is that belonging to a relationship lending
network reduces the price a bank pays for liquidity. This is motivated by sugges-
tions that such networks may help banks overcome frictions in the interbank market
[Freixas et al (2000)]. Cocco, Gomes, and Martins (2003) find evidence that banks
create such informal networks in the interbank market to hedge against adverse
liquidity shocks. Furfine (1999) presents evidence suggesting the existence of re-
lationships banking in the federal funds market. While we do not have data that
allow us to identify informal bank networks, in Germany many such networks ex-
ist formally. In particular, every savings and cooperative bank belongs to formal
networks of other savings and cooperative banks. Each network has its official and
6Thus our findings may be relevant for the literature on the advantages and disadvantages to
size in banking, see e.g., Peek and Rosengren (1998), Berger and Udell (2002), Sapienza (2002),
and Berger, Nathan, Petersen, Rajan, and Stein, (2005).

unique head institution through which liquidity is reallocated within the network.
In contrast, private banks are left to their own devices. Ehrmann and Worms (2004)
suggest that the formal liquidity networks of savings and cooperative banks can help
them overcome disadvantages they may have due to being small. Thus, controlling
for size and other factors, we might expect savings and cooperative banks to have
an advantage over private banks and therefore pay less for liquidity.
However, we find almost the opposite. Controlling for size, liquidity position,
imbalance, volatility, and other market conditions, cooperatives pay on average .4 bp
more than private banks. That savings banks do not pay less is especially surprising,
since they had governmental guarantees during the sample period. One would expect
that the resulting increase in credit quality would allow savings banks to borrow on
superior terms in the interbank market. A possible reason why savings banks and
cooperatives do not pay less for liquidity than private banks may be that their
respective networks do not provide good diversification with respect to liquidity
shocks. A further explanation to our findings may involve an argument along the
lines of Bhattacharya and Gale (1987) that formal liquidity networks are prone to
fostering a free-riding problem with respect to liquidity management. Individual
savings banks and cooperatives may free-ride in particular on the liquidity provision
of their head institution. Thus, networks ultimately fail to provide a cheaper source
of liquidity for banks.7
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides institutional
background on the German banking sector, reserve requirements, and the role of
the main refinancing operations. Section 2 also describes the datasets used in this
paper. Section 3 defines various liquidity status variables and provides descriptive
statistics on these variables as well on the rates banks pay for liquidity, the rates
they bid at in the auctions, and other bidding measures. Section 4 studies the data
cross-sectionally. Section 5 presents the panel analysis and provides the main results

2 Institutional Background and Data
2.1 The Structure of the German Banking Sector
The German banking system is traditionally a system of universal banking and has a
three-pillar structure. The first pillar, the private domestic commercial banks, made
up around 40% of the entire banking sector in terms of balance sheet total by the end
of 2000. The second pillar are the public banks. This group comprises the savings
banks and the savings banks' regional head institutions, the Landesbanks, which are
jointly owned by the respective state and the regional association of savings banks.
While the Landesbanks account for 20% of the German banking sector in terms of
balance sheet total, the savings banks had around 16% of the German banking sec-
tor's asset under management by the end of 2000. The cooperative banking sector
with the credit cooperatives and the cooperative central banks, which are primarily
owned by the regional credit cooperatives, constitute the third pillar. They com-
prised 12% of the German banking sector of which the credit cooperatives accounted
for 9 percentage points. Besides those major banking groups special purpose banks
(like the Kreditanstalt f¨
ur Wiederaufbau) and buildings societies (Bausparkassen)
account for 7% and 2% of the banking sector, respectively. Branches of foreign
banks operating in Germany made up 2% of the German banking sector by the end
of 2000.8
This three pillar structure affects the way in which liquidity is reallocated in
the banking sector. The public banks as well as the cooperative banking sector
form a relatively closed giro system. On balance, the second-tier institutions ­ the
savings banks and the credit cooperatives ­ typically achieve a significant liquidity

(2004).

surplus due to their retail business structure. Within the giro-systems, they pass this
excess liquidity on to the respective (regional) head institution. Consequently, on
average in the years 2000 and 2001 savings banks held almost 75% of their interbank
overnight deposits with their respective Landesbank. At the same time only slightly
more than 50% of savings banks' overnight borrowing was obtained from the regional
Landesbank. Similarly, credit cooperatives granted more than 90% of their overnight
interbank loans to one of the cooperative central banks, while they only received
around 30% of their overnight interbank borrowing from the cooperative central
banks. Conversely, the cooperative cental banks obtained around 60% of the daily
interbank liabilities from credit cooperatives, while Landesbanks, however, received
less than 30% of their overnight interbank loans from the regional savings banks.
Instead they obtained the waste majority of their short-term interbank funds from
foreign banks.9 Thus savings (i.e. public) and cooperative banks may have less of a
need to participate directly in the market for reserves than private banks.
2.2 Minimum Reserve Requirements
According to the regulation of Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the national central bank of the Euro area countries, all German
credit institution, including subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks in Germany,
are subject to a minimum reserve requirement. The required reserves have to be held
as average end-of-business-day balances over the maintenance period on account
with the national central bank. During the sample period of this paper, reserve
maintenance periods had a length of one month, starting on the 24th of each month
and ending on the following 23rd, and German banks accounted for around 30% of
total reserve requirements in the euro zone.
The basis for the calculation of a bank's reserve requirement is its end-of-calendar-

and within the three pillars in particular see Deutsche Bundesbank (2000) and Upper and Worms
(2004).

month short-term liabilities,10 held by non-banks or banks outside the euro area two
months before the maintenance period. For example, a bank's reserve requirements
for the maintenance period starting May 24th are determined by its short term lia-
bilities on March 31. The minimum reserve requirement is 2% of these liabilities.11
Thus banks that are financed primarily with short-term liabilities are required to
hold relatively more reserves.
The required reserve holdings are remunerated at the average stop-out rate of
the Eurosystems' main refinancing operations, during the respective maintenance
period. Reserve holdings that exceed the minimum requirement are not remuner-
ated, but can be transferred to the standing deposit facility which is always 100 basis
points below the minimum bid rate in the auctions. The Eurosystem also operates
with a marginal lending facility, where banks can borrow against collateral at a rate
which is 100 basis points above the minimum bid rate in the auction. Compliance
with reserve requirements is a hard constraint; unlike the US, these cannot be rolled
over into the next maintenance period.12
10More precisely, these are the overnight deposits, deposits with an agreed maturity up to two
years, deposits redeemable at notice up to two years, and issued debt securities with agreed ma-
turity up to two years.
11For a more detailed description of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system see European
Central Bank (2005).
12If a bank fails to hold sufficient reserves, for example because it fails to make up a reserve
shortfall at the marginal lending facility, the ECB can impose any of the following sanctions: It
can require payment of 1) up to 5 percentage points above the marginal lending rate or 2) up to
two times the marginal lending rate on the difference between the required and the actually held
reserves. Furthermore, the ECB can call for the provision of non-interest bearing deposits up to
three times the amount the respective bank failed to provide for. The maturity of those deposits
must not exceed the period during which the institution failed to meet the reserve requirement.
The ECB can impose additional sanctions if an institution repeatedly fails to comply with the
reserve requirement.

2.3 Main Refinancing Operations
There is a main refinancing operation (or repo auction) every week, each with a
tenor of two weeks during the sample period.13 Thus there are up to five operations
within each reserve maintenance period. Each operation is timed to coincide with
the maturity of funds obtained in the second-to-previous operation. The operations
are scheduled well in advance; the intended timing of all regular operations in a year
are announced three months before the start of the year. Typically, the operations
are scheduled for Tuesdays, 9:30 am, with terms being announced on Mondays, 3:30
pm. Results are announced on the auction day at 11:20 am. Winning bids are settled
the following business day. The operations are open to all banks in the European
Monetary Union that are subject to reserve requirements.
In each operation, or auction, each bidder can submit up to 10 bids which are
rate-quantity pairs for two week money. The tick size is 1 basis point and the
quantity multiple is 100,000 euros. There are no non-competitive bids. There is a
pre-announced minimum bid rate. This rate is determined at the meetings of the
ECB's Governing Council, normally held on the first and third Thursday of each
month during the sample period. The minimum bid rate was changed six times
during the sample period. It started out at 4.25%, changed to 4.5% in time for
the 5 September 2000 auction, then increased to 4.75% in time for the 11 October
2000 auction, fell back to 4.50% for the auctions held on and after 14 May 2001,
fell further to 4.25% for the auction on and after 4 September 2001, to 3.75% on
18 September 2001 and to 3.25% on 13 November 2001, at which level it remained
until the end of the sample period.
At the time of the auction announcement, the ECB publishes an estimate of
liquidity needs for the entire euro area banking sector for the following week. Given
13Once a month, the Eurosystem also holds longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity
of three months. We do not study these operations. See Linzert et al (2007). The ECB may also
hold non-regular, fine-tuning operations with non-standard maturities, for example overnight, but
none occurred during the sample period.
10
the ECB's neutral allotment policy, this provides bidders with an unbiased estimate
of the auction size. We refer to this liquidity neutral amount as the expected auction
size. Deviations may occur because of the lag between the auction announcements
(Mondays, 3.30pm) and the allotment decision (Tuesdays, 11.20am). During this
period, the ECB may have updated its forecast of the banking sector's liquidity
needs. Deviations from the expected auction size also occur in a few instances where
banks in aggregate demanded less than the liquidity neutral amount, speculating on
decreases in the minimum bid rate in time for the next auction in the maintenance
period. However, as documented in Nyborg et al (2002), deviations tend to be very
small, averaging to less than 1% of the pre-announced liquidity neutral amount.
Thus, bidders face little supply uncertainty in these auctions.
2.4 Data
Our analysis makes use of three data sources supplied by the Bundesbank. First,
we have the complete set of bids made by German registered financial institutions,
broken down by bidder, in all 78 ECB repo auctions (main refinancing operations) in
the period 27 June 2000 to 18 December 2001. This covers 18 reserve maintenance
periods. The number of German bidders in an auction varies from 122 to 546.
Second, we have reserve data from all 2,520 German registered financial in-
stitutions in the period May 2000 to December 2001 that were required to hold
reserves with the central bank as of December 2001. The reserve data covers 842
bidders in the main refinancing operations and 1,678 non-bidders. A bidder is de-
fined as a bank that bids at least once and therefore appears in the auction dataset.
The reserve data consists of each institution's cumulative reserve holdings within
the maintenance period, as well as its marginal reserve holding, at the end of each
business day preceeding an auction. In addition, we have each institution's reserve
requirement for each maintenance period over the sample period. The reserve data
are not available for 518 institutions that ceased operating as stand-alone entities
11
during the sample period. 17 of these submitted bids in the auctions.
Third, we have end-of-month balance sheet data for each bank, also supplied
by the Bundesbank. These come from bank balance sheet statistics that German
banks are required to report to the Bundesbank on a monthly basis. As a measure of
size, we thus use the book value of a bank's total assets at the end of each calendar
month.
Unique bank codes allow us to track banks over time and correlate bidding de-
cisions with characteristics such as size and fulfillment of reserves. The complete
bidding data consists of 59,644 individual bids and 25,345 individual demand sched-
ules from 859 bidders. Deleting the bids from the 17 bidding banks for which we
do not have reserve data reduces this to 59,156 individual bids and 25,120 individ-
ual demand schedules from 842 different bidders. We lack balance sheet data on
7 bidders, taking the number of bidders for which we have complete data down to
835.
The dataset is pruned further as follows: First, we exclude 45 banks that are reg-
istered with zero reserve requirement in every maintenance period during the sample
period. Second, we throw out two extreme outliers; the first is a non-bidder that
has an average reserve fulfillment (relative to required reserves) of 190,926%. The
second is a bidder with an average reserve fulfillment of 3,011%. Without this bank,
the average fulfillment of private domestic bidding banks is 100.1%; with this bank,
the average is 131.8%. The next highest average reserve fulfillment among private
banks is 146.8%. This takes the dataset down to 834 bidders and 1,632 non-bidders.
Third, we exclude Bausparkassen and special purpose banks (14 institutions)14. The
analysis below is thus carried out on a final set of 820 bidders (and 23,673 individual
demand schedules) and 1,632 non-bidders.
14These institutions have very low reserve requirements, averaging to around 0.1% of total as-
sets. This is substantially lower than for other banking sectors, reflecting that they have different
functions than typical banks. The Bausparkassen sector also includes several extreme outliers with
respect to reserve fulfillment.

3 Descriptive Statistics
The summary statistics we present in this section break our dataset out in several
ways. First, we differentiate between bidders, i.e. those banks that submit bids
in at least one auction, and non-bidders. Second, within these two categories, we
differentiate between six different types of banks, as described above; private banks
(domestic), savings banks, cooperatives, branches of foreign banks, Landesbanks,
and cooperative central banks.
3.1 Definitions of Liquidity Status Variables
To measure banks' liquidity status, we focus on the variables "fulfillment" and "nor-
malized net excess reserves", described below. These are different ways of gauging
the extent to which a bank is short or long reserves going into an auction.
Fulfillment is a bank's cumulative reserve holdings as a percentage of its cumu-
lative required reserves, within a reserve maintenance period.
fulfillmentijp
=
cumulative holdingijp
cumulative required reservesijp
× 100, (1)
where i refers to the bank, j to the auction, and p to the reserve maintenance
period. Multiplying by 100 means that we express fulfillment as a percentage. The
fulfillment is measured for each bank using reserve data at the close business the day
before each auction. A fulfillment of 100% means that the bank has held reserves
thus far in the maintenance period with a daily average exactly equal to the average
daily requirement the bank faces this period. Thus, a fulfillment of less (more) than
100% indicates that the bank is short (long).
To define normalized net excess reserves, we start with the "gross excess re-
serves". This compares the reserves the bank has on deposit with the central bank
the evening before the auction with what it needs to hold on a daily basis for the
balance of the reserve maintenance period in order to exactly fulfill reserve require-
13
ments.
gross excess reservesijp
= holdingijp
- required remaining daily holdingijp
, (2)
where
required remaining daily holdingijp
=
required total monthly reserves
ip
- cumulative holding
ijp
days left of maintenance period
jp
.
(3)
The "net excess reserves" nets out from a bank's holding the loan from two
auctions ago that matures at the time of the current auction.
net excess reservesijp
= gross excess reservesijp
- maturing repoijp
(4)
where maturing repoijp
is the amount the bidder won in auction j - 2. Since this
amount matures at the time of auction j, the net excess reserves is what the bank
needs to borrow in the auction in order to be even with respect to its reserve re-
quirements. A negative (positive) net excess reserves is indicative of the bank being
short (long).
We normalize the net excess reserves for size by dividing it by the average daily
required holding:
normalized net excess reservesijp
=
net excess reservesijp
average daily required reservesip
× 100. (5)
In a similar way, we also define the "normalized gross excess reserves" by dividing
the gross excess reserves by the average daily required reserves.
The normalized net excess reserves measure takes into account not only a bank's
fulfillment thus far in the maintenance period, but also its liquidity need going for-
ward, including the need to refinance maturing repos. For this reason, this measure
is arguably a better indicator of liquidity need than fulfillment, and we therefore
use it in the regression analysis. Normalization by required reserves means that the
measure is independent of size, allowing us to distinguish between size and pure
liquidity status effects. A bank that always has a fulfillment of 100% and borrows
in every auction (borrows in no auction) will have a negative (zero) normalized net
excess reserves going into every auction.
14
3.2 Liquidity Status and Size Statistics
Table 1 provides summary statistics on a comprehensive set of liquidity status vari-
ables for bidding banks, broken down into the six bank categories. Table 2 does
the same for non-bidding banks, but in this case there are only four bank categories
since there are no Landesbanks or cooperative central banks that have not submit-
ted bids in the auctions over the sample period. Comparing these two tables reveals
that the average bidder differs substantially on two key dimensions from the average
non-bidder.
First, category by category, bidders are larger than non-bidders by all size mea-
sures; asset size, reserve requirements, holding of reserves, and required remaining
reserves. For example, for bidding private banks these measures average to (in eu-
ros): 22,794 mill (asset size), 132.43 mill (average daily reserve requirement), 130.53
mill (holdings of reserves on the evening prior to an operation), and 136.73 mill
(average daily remaining required reserves). The corresponding numbers for non-
bidders are: 1,478 mill, 6.99 mill, and 7.71 mill, and 5.96 mill.
Second, bidders are shorter liquidity than non-bidders. For bidders, the average
normalized net excess reserves is negative for all bank categories; whereas it is pos-
itive for non-bidders. So by this measure, bidders are short going into the auctions,
while non-bidders are long. The average fulfillment is also smaller for bidders than
it is for non-bidders. For example, for private banks: the average normalized net
excess reserves is -243.82%, with a median of -83.39%; while for non-bidders the
mean and median are 210.83% and 24.93%, respectively; and the mean and median
fulfillment are 100.25% and 101.81% for bidders as compared with 169.61% and
108.13% for non-bidders. To summarize, non-bidders are comparatively small and
long, while bidders are comparatively large and short.
The tables also show significant differences across bank categories. Focusing on
Table 1 (bidders), we see that Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are sub-
stantially larger than the other categories, including the private banks. Mean asset
15
values are (in euros) 96,918 mill for Landesbanks, and 60,320 mill for cooperative
central banks, as compared with 22,794 mill for private banks, 2,092 mill for savings
banks, 678 mill for cooperatives, and 2,256 mill for branches of foreign banks. So,
on average by asset value, Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are up to 4.5
times larger than private banks. At the same time, private banks are approximately
10 times larger than savings and foreign banks, which in turn are approximately
3 times as large as cooperatives. The smallest asset value in the sample is 25.96
million (a cooperative), and the largest value is 267,591 million (a domestic private
bank).
Mean daily reserve requirements for bidders are: 132.4 million for private banks,
22.1 million for savings banks, 7.8 million for cooperatives, 17.1 million for foreign
banks, 352.0 for Landesbanks, and 241.2 for cooperative central banks. By this
measure, Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are on average about 2.5 times
larger than private banks. Private banks are almost 6 times larger than savings
banks, almost 8 times larger than foreign banks, and approximately 17 times larger
than cooperatives. The largest average daily reserve requirement is 2,901.6 million
(a domestic private bank). This is quite small in comparison to a typical auction
size of around 90 billion.
There are also differences in liquidity status among bidding banks. As noted
above, private domestic banks have a mean fulfillment of 100.25% . Savings banks
and cooperatives have similar mean fulfillments, 102.65% and 102.94%, respectively.
The mean fulfillment across foreign institutions is 142.30%. Landesbanks have the
lowest fulfillment, 82.44%, while cooperative central banks have a fulfillment of
99.00%. So, on average, as measured by fulfillment, German private domestic banks,
savings banks, and cooperatives are slightly long, while cooperative central banks
and in particular Landesbanks are short going into the auctions. However, taking
into account maturing repos, all categories of banks are on average short going into
the auctions, as seen by the negative mean and median normalized net excess re-
serves. Again, Landesbanks and cooperative central bank appear to be shorter on
16
average than the other bank categories. There is also substantial variation across
individual banks. The smallest average fulfillment among bidders is 50.85% (a pri-
vate bank) and the largest is 685.95% (a foreign bank). The normalized net excess
reserves varies from -3, 739.82% (a private bank) to 968.01% (a foreign bank).
3.3 Pricing and Bidding Measures and Statistics
Table 3 reports on various pricing and bidding characteristics, by bank type. It
focuses on different bank categories' willingness to pay for liquidity and how much
these bank categories end up paying, both in absolute terms and relatively to other
bank categories. This table draws on all banks that bid at least once. For each
bank, we measure the relevant variables first for each individual demand schedule
(i.e. across the bidders' set of bids in a given auction). Then we average across
demand schedules for each bank to obtain a population of bank level observations,
whose summary statistics are reported in the table.
To benchmark bids and rates paid in the main refinancing operations, we follow
Nyborg et al (2002) and use the two week Eonia swap rate taken as the midpoint
of the bid and ask from Reuters quotations at 9:15 a.m. on the auction day. Our
pricing variables are:
· Underpricing: This is a measure of the price paid by bidders relative to the
contemporaneous swap rate. It equals the swap rate less the bidder's quantity
weighted average winning bids.15
· Relative underpricing: a bidder's underpricing in a given auction less the av-
erage underpricing in that auction across bidders (in the sample).
· Discount: This is a measure of the willingness to pay. It equals the swap rate
less the bidder's quantity weighted average bid rate.16
15We call this quantity underpricing because the rate paid is typically below the contemporaneous
swap rate (midpoint of the bid and ask).
16We call this quantity discount because the rate bid is typically below the contemporaneous
17
· Relative discount: a bidder's discount in a given auction less the average
discount in that auction across bidders.
In addition to the pricing variables, we also report on a number of bidding variables,
which help provide a more comprehensive picture of banks' bidding decisions.
· Stopout deviation: the quantity-weighted standard deviation of bids around
the stopout rate.17 This is a measure of how well a bank predicts the stop-out
rate and therefore affects what it pays for liquidity.
· Award ratio: a bidder's award in an auction as a percentage of his demand.
· Demand to reserve requirement: demand (summed across individual bids)
divided by the bank's reserve requirement (in the maintenance period where
the auction occurs).
· Award to total award: a bidder's award in an auction as a percentage of
aggregate award in that auction to financial institutions registered in Germany.
· Bidding frequency: percentage of auctions a bank participates in.18
· Number of bids: the number of interest rate-quantity pairs.
There are substantial differences across bank categories in the prices paid for
liquidity, as measured by underpricing and relative underpricing. Private banks
have an average underpricing and relative underpricing of 1.24 bp and 0.07 bp,
respectively. For savings banks, the corresponding numbers are 1.66 bp and -0.01
bp; for cooperatives they are 0.78 bp and -0.87 bp; for foreign banks they are
0.69 bp and -0.18 bp; for Landesbanks they are 1.48 bp and 0.53 bp, and for
cooperative central banks they are 2.82 bp and 0.51 bp. Thus Landesbanks are
swap rate (midpoint of the bid and ask).
17The stopout, or marginal, rate is the rate of the lowest winning bid.
18This means that, unlike the other variables in this list, bidding frequency is not an average
across a bank's demand schedules in different auctions.
18
the best performers, having a relative underpricing which is 1.40 bp higher than
cooperatives, which are the worst performers. The Landesbanks are closely followed
by the cooperative central banks.19
We see very similar results when we analyze the willingness to pay for liquidity
across different bank categories. This is measured by discount and relative discount.
Private banks have an average discount and relative discount of 3.04 bp and 0.14
bp, respectively. For savings banks, the corresponding numbers are 3.32 bp and
-0.09 bp; for cooperatives they are 3.47 bp and -0.18 bp; for foreign banks they
are 2.84 bp and -0.15 bp; for Landesbanks they are 2.83 bp and 0.50 bp, and for
cooperative central banks they are 4.27 bp and 0.45 bp. Thus Landesbanks and
cooperative central banks, followed by the private banks, are willing to pay less for
liquidity than the rest of the banks.
The stopout deviation captures the banks' ability to correctly predict the stopout
rate in a given auction. It is lowest for the Landesbanks, 1.04 bp, and cooperative
central banks, 1.17 bp, and highest for the cooperatives, 2.80 bp. These results
are thus consistent again with the larger relative underpricing we observe for the
Landesbanks and cooperative central banks.
The award ratio measures the relative aggressiveness of a bidder. An award
ratio of 100% in a given auction means that all of a bidder's bids won, i.e. all his
bids were above the stop-out rate. Thus the bidder can be said to have been highly
aggressive relative to other bidders. An award ratio of 0 is indicative of very cautious
bidding. Cooperative central banks have the lowest award ratio, 42.34%, followed
by the Landesbanks with an award ratio of 48.54%. There are only relatively small
differences in award ratios across the other bank categories. The range is from
19A caveat with respect to using the raw underpricing number, instead of the relative under-
pricing, to gauge what banks pay relative to each other is that the raw underpricing measure gives
more weight to the early auctions in the sample period, since these auctions had a higher partic-
ipation rate (see Nyborg et al (2002) for a discussion of the decreasing time trend in the number
of bidders). Since interbank rates were higher around these auctions, the underpricing in these
auctions was higher than in later auctions.
19
54.90% for private banks to 58.97% for cooperatives.
The award to total award varies between 0.03% (cooperatives), 0.09% (savings),
0.17% (foreign), 0.63% (private), 1.45% (cooperative central banks), and 1.68%
(Landesbanks). The maximum is 11.58% (a private domestic bank). These numbers
illustrate how small any bank in this market is compared to the market size.
The average demand to reserve requirement ratio goes from 249.83% (coopera-
tives) to 1221.95% (cooperative central banks). These high averages are influenced
by some extremely large observations. The largest single observation is 12,124.14%
(a private bank).
Landesbanks participate more frequently than other banks, specifically they bid
on average in 80.45% of the 78 auctions. Cooperative bidders participate in the
fewest number of auctions, only 27.51%. As seen by comparing Tables 1 and 2
the cooperative sector also has the smallest participation rate, as measured by the
percentage of banks in the sector that bid at least once. The average number of bids
per demand schedule varies from 1.87 (foreign banks) to 3.51 (cooperative central
banks).
The univariate statistics for the pricing and bidding variables in this section do
not control for other important factors such as the size of a bank and auction specific
exogenous variables. This will be addressed in the subsequent regression analysis.
4 Cross-Sectional Analysis
Our objective in this section is to produce a first take of some patterns that are
apparent in the data, especially with respect to the relation between a bank's size and
the price it pays for liquidity. The cross-sectional analysis in this section is refined in
the next section where we take advantage of the panel structure of the data. In the
current section, the focus is necessarily on features that are permanent or relatively
time invariant, i.e., bank size and type. We start by tabulating descriptive statistics
for different size groups, along similar lines as what we did in the previous section for
20
different bank types. We then present cross-sectional regressions of the price banks
pay for liquidity and their willingness to pay, as well as some other performance
variables, on bank size, a bank's typical liquidity position, and bank type.
4.1 Size Sorted Groups
We divide the sample of bidders and non-bidders, excluding Landesbanks and coop-
erative central banks, into two sets of 12 size groups, sorted by average asset value.
That is, for all bidders, we first calculate each bank's average asset value throughout
the sample period and place the banks into the following percentile groupings: 0 -
5, 6 -10, 11 - 20, 21 - 40, 41 - 60, 61 -80, 91 - 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99. We do the same
for non-bidders.
We report on liquidity status statistics across auctions for these groups in Table 4.
Panel (a) reports on bidders and panel (b) on non-bidders. Focusing on bidders, the
average asset value for banks in the 99th percentile is 105,928.50 million euros, while
the average size of banks in the 0-5th percentiles is 71.22 million. This illustrates that
there is a large heterogeneity in terms of size. With respect to liquidity positions,
the table shows that the average normalized net excess reserves is negative for all
size groups, with large banks being more short than small banks. For example,
it is -372.45% for the 99th percentile and -14.70% for the smallest size group.
Large banks are more short also by other measures; for example, the 99th percentile
has an average normalized gross excess reserves of -8.11% versus 39.00% for the
smallest size group, and an average fulfillment going into an auction of 94.00%
versus 111.61% for the smallest size group. A possible reason for why large banks
take shorter positions is that they are involved in a greater range of business and are
thus fundamentally better insured against adverse liquidity shocks [along the lines
discussed in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002)].
In contrast to bidders, panel (b) shows that for all non-bidding size groups, the
gross excess reserves is positive, illustrating again that bidders tend to be more short
21
than non-bidders.20 Paralleling the result for bidding banks, we also see that among
non-bidders, larger banks are also less long than smaller banks.
Table 5 provides price and bidding statistics for the same size groups as in
Table 4. Focusing on our measures for the relative price of liquidity, we see that these
vary substantially among groups. Underpricing is negative for the three smallest
groups (up to the bottom 20 percent), and relative underpricing is negative for the
six smallest groups (up to the bottom 80 percent). The differences in underpricing
and relative underpricing, respectively, between the 99th percentile and the 0-5th
percentiles are 2.09 bp and 2.06 bp. But the best performing percentile is actually
the 97th, which has an underpricing of 1.35 bp as compared with .76 for the 99th
percentile. These differences reflect a larger willingness to pay among smaller banks,
as revealed by their larger discount. However, the difference in discounts between
the largest and smallest size groups only explains approximately 1 basis point of
the 2 bp difference in what they pay. The extra difference appears to be due to
larger banks having a smaller stopout deviation; the 99th percentile group has a
stopout deviation of 1.09 bp versus 2.78 bp for the smallest 0-5th percentile. This
increased precision of larger banks' bids, relative to the stopout rate, means that
larger banks tend to win with lower bids than smaller banks, contributing to larger
banks obtaining liquidity at a cheaper price. Finally, we note that the higher bids
of small bidders is reflected in their higher award ratios, this is 65.36% for the group
of the smallest banks but only 52.40% for those in the 97th percentile.
The table also reports on group level statistics; number bidders, fraction winners,
standard deviation of discount, and award to total award. For each group, these are
calculated for each auction, with the table reporting the means across the auctions.
From the perspective of what banks pay for liquidity, the most interesting group
variable is arguably the standard deviation of discounts. This tells us how much bids
are spread out within a group in an auction. It complements the stopout deviation.
20Note that for non-bidders, the gross excess reserves is the identical to the net excess reserves,
since there is no maturing repo for these banks.
22
The group standard deviation of discounts is 1.41 bp for the 99th percentile size
group versus 3.63 bp for the 0-5th percentile. Thus, in the smaller size group, we
see more extreme bidding, which in turn leads to smaller banks winning with larger
bids, and thus ending up paying more.
To conclude, from Tables 4 and 5, we see a sharp size effect in the primary
market for liquidity; large banks have shorter positions, yet are willing to pay less,
and end up paying less, as compared with smaller banks.
4.2 Regression Analysis
For each bidding bank, we consider the following dependent variables, as averages
across the auctions where the bank participated or won some units:21 underpricing,
relative underpricing, discount, relative discount, stopout deviation, award ratio,
and demand to reserve requirements. As independent variables, we employ for each
bank: the natural log of the bank's assets and the net normalized excess reserves,
both as averages over the sample period. We also include bank sector dummy
variables for savings, cooperatives, foreign banks, Landesbanks, and cooperative
central banks, thus taking private domestic banks as the benchmark. Standard
errors are adjusted for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of
variance.
The results of these cross-sectional regressions are reported in Table 6. With
respect to bank size, the findings are consistent with those above; the price of
liquidity decreases in bank size. The coefficient on ln(assets) in the underpricing
regression is .2. In other words, an increase in size (in millions) by a factor of e leads
to a .2 bp increase in underpricing. The coefficient on the normalized net excess
reserves is positive, but insignificant. There is thus weak evidence that bidders that
are "more long" have lower underpricing.
The regression evidence on the underpricing size effect can be compared to the
21Underpricing and relative underpricing can only be calculated conditional on winning. The
other dependent variables are calculated conditional on bidding.
23
increase in underpricing in the larger size groups as reported in Table 5. Going from
the smallest group to the 98th and 99th percentile groups represents an increase in
the natural log of the average asset size of approximately 5.8 and 7.2, respectively.
According to the regression results, this gives an increase in underpricing from the
lowest to the 98th and 99th percentile groups of approximately 1.17 bp and 1.45 bp,
respectively. This is lower than the differences reported in Table 5 of 2.21 bp and
2.06 bp, respectively. This reflects that the smallest group has an exceedingly poor
performance. Comparing the second smallest size group (6-10th percentile) to the
98th percentile, we have an increase in ln(asset size) of approximately 5.2, which
according to the regression results gives an increase in underpricing 1.05 bp. This
is in line with the numbers in Table 5, which shows a difference of 1.19 bp.
The regression results in Table 6 on the discount shows that this measure is not
related to bank size. This is surprising given the strong relation between underpric-
ing and bank size. It is also in contrast to the results from the size sorted groups.
A difference now, of course, is that the regression controls for liquidity positions
and bank type. Looking at the stopout deviation regression, we see that the reason
large banks end up paying less is that they cluster their bids tighter around the
stop-out rate than do smaller banks, as can be seen from the negative coefficient on
ln(assets).
Looking at the coefficients of the net normalized excess reserves in the seven
regressions in Table 6, we see that we cannot conclude that banks pay more for
liquidity, the shorter they are, contrary to what one might expect. Of course, since
a bank's liquidity position changes over time, cross-sectional regressions are not the
appropriate way to examine the effect of liquidity positions.
5 Panel Regressions
This section contains the main analysis of the paper. We start by running plain
panel regressions on the sample of bidding banks, examining the impact on the
24
key pricing and bidding variables of a range of bank characteristics and market
conditions. We then examine the robustness of these findings by running Heckman
selection regressions to take into account a bank's decision to participate in a given
auction, using bidding as well as non-bidding banks.
5.1 Explanatory Variables
The explanatory variables can be divided into four categories. First, we have the
(more or less) permanent bank characteristics, ln(assets) and bank type. Second,
we have liquidity condition variables, which include a temporary bank character-
istic, normalized net excess reserves; a market condition, imbalance; and two in-
teraction variables, imbalance×nex (nex is the normalized net excess reserves) and
imbalance×ln(assets). Third, we have auction specific market conditions, expected
auction size and the size ratio. Fourth, we have interbank rate variables, the swap
spread, the negative swap spread, and volatility. These are described in more detail
below (but not the bank characteristics, which are discussed in earlier sections).
Liquidity position variables: We use our reserve position data to calculate a
measure of imbalance in the market. In particular, for each operation, we define
imbalance to be the standard deviation of the normalized net excess reserves across
all banks, bidders and non-bidders alike. The purpose of including this variable in
our regressions is to examine the hypothesis that liquidity is more expensive when
there is a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks. For each bank,
we interact imbalance with the normalized net excess reserves (nex), in order to
examine the extent to which more short banks may be more vulnerable to a greater
imbalance in the market. Under the hypothesis that short squeezing is an issue,
Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004) show that a greater dispersion of holdings across
banks leads to more aggressive bidding by shorts that are subject to the possibility
of being squeezed as well as by banks that have sufficient market power to implement
a squeeze. Given the importance of bank size, documented in the previous section,
25
we also interact imbalance with ln(assets) to examine the extent to which smaller
banks may have a further disadvantage in more imbalanced markets.
Operation specific market conditions: Under the hypothesis that positions mat-
ter and that short squeezing may be a concern, we would expect that the price
of liquidity is larger when the operation offers a poor opportunity for refinancing
maturing loans from the operations two weeks ago. To examine this, we define the
size ratio to be the expected size of the current operation as a percentage of the size
of the operation two weeks ago, and which now needs to be refinanced. To control
for the absolute size of an auction, we include the expected auction size, defined as
the liquidity neutral amount as announced by the ECB the afternoon before the
operation.
Interbank rate variables: Following Nyborg et al. (2002), we define the swap
spread as the two week Eonia swap rate at 9:15 on the auction day (see above) less
the minimum bid rate in the auction. We also follow these authors in calculating
the conditional volatility of the swap rate using a modified GARCH model, based
on daily observations at 9:15 am (see Appendix 2) in the period 4 January 1999 to
20 December 2001. All these variables are shown by Nyborg et al to affect bidder
behavior in the ECB's main refinancing operations. The swap spread, in particular,
contributes to a high R2. We also define the negative swap spread as dummy variable
which is 1 if the swap rate is below the minimum bid rate and zero otherwise. Nyborg
et al find that this occurs for some auctions and that it has an adverse impact on
bidders' demand.
Summary statistics for the market condition variables, including the two inter-
action variables, are in Table 7. Imbalance has a mean of 1,144% and a standard
deviation of 3,331%. It is highly skewed; the minimum is 86%, the median is 400%,
and the maximum is 26,997%. Imbalance×nex has a mean of -208,065%2 and a stan-
dard deviation of approximately 10 times that. Imbalance×ln(assets) has a mean of
7,543 and a standard deviation of around three times that. The size ratio averages
to 1.24 and has a standard deviation of 1.75. Its minimum is .2 and its maximum
26
is 15.8, illustrating that there is a substantial range in this measure. There is sub-
stantially larger scope to refinance a repo when the current auction is 15.8 times
larger than the previous one as compared with when the size ratio is merely .2.
The expected auction size has an average of 84.256 billion euros, with a standard
deviation of 28.829 billion. On auction days, the swap spread has an average of 5.91
bp, with a standard deviation of 8.66 bp. The volatility of the swap rate has an
average of 5.32 bp on auction days, with a standard deviation of 1.33 bp.
5.2 Panel Regressions without Heckman Correction
In this subsection, we run panel regressions of underpricing, relative underpricing,
discount, relative discount, stopout deviation, award ratio, and demand to reserve
requirement on the explanatory variables discussed above. Standard errors are ad-
justed for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of variance and are
clustered on the auctions.
Table 8 reports the results. Each column represents a different regression, and
we discuss each in turn. The underpricing regression confirms our earlier results
that large banks pay less for liquidity; the coefficient on ln(size) in the underpricing
regression is a statistically significant (at the 1% level) 0.155. Looking at the bank
type dummies, we see that only the cooperatives have an underpricing which is
statistically different from that of private banks. Controlling for all other factors,
cooperatives pay .359 bp more for liquidity than private banks.
With respect to the liquidity position variables, note first that the coefficient
on the normalized net excess reserves is statistically insignificant. However, the
coefficient on imbalance is negative and statistically significant, meaning that the
price of liquidity in the primary market relative to the contemporaneous swap rate
increases when there is greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks. The
effect is also economically significant, given the magnitudes that we are dealing
with in this market. A one standard deviation increase in imbalance leads to a
27
decrease in underpricing of approximately .4 bp. The coefficient on the interaction
variable imbalance×nex is positive and statistically significant. A one standard
deviation increase in this variable has a .04 bp effect on underpricing. This shows
that as imbalance increases, banks pay more for liquidity the shorter they are. The
interaction variable imbalance×ln(assets) is also positive and statistically significant.
In this case, a one standard deviation increase in the independent variable leads to
an increase in underpricing of approximately .1 bp. In other words, as imbalance
increases, large banks suffer less than small banks, in terms of the price they pay
for liquidity.
Turning now to the operation specific market condition variables, the coefficients
on the size ratio and the expected size are .097 and .030, respectively, both significant
at the 1% level. So as the auction size grows, the price paid for liquidity falls. The
positive coefficient on expected size may reflect that increasingly expensive collateral
has to be used as the auction size grows, as suggested by Nyborg et al (2002).
The positive size ratio coefficient tells us that the price of liquidity gets relatively
more expensive when the scope for refinancing falls. This illustrates that aggregate
positions matter.
Finally, the interbank rate variables follow the results previously documented
by Nyborg et al (2002). Underpricing increases in the swap spread and decreases
in volatility. The negative swap spread dummy variable obviously has a negative
coefficient, since bids below the minimum bid rate are not admissible.
The relative underpricing regression is similar, except that most of the market
condition variables are now insignificant, as one would expect. The coefficient on im-
balance and the two interaction variables, however, are still statistically significant.
The negative coefficient on imbalance is interesting. It means that the distribution
of the price paid for liquidity across banks in an operation is skewed towards higher
rates. This is consistent with the view that a larger imbalance leads to a larger
chance of a liquidity squeeze.
The discount regression is also in line with the underpricing regression, but with
28
some notable exceptions. First, paralleling the cross-sectional regressions, we see
that ln(assets) is not significantly different from zero. Second, the normalized net
excess reserves is now significant at the 1% level. Specifically, the coefficient is
2.4 × 10-4, showing that the shorter a banks is the smaller is the discount. This is
equivalent to saying that a one standard deviation (for private banks) decrease in the
normalized net excess reserve, leads to increase in the relative willingness to pay by
approximately .1 bp. The interaction variable imbalance×nex is not different from
zero, in contrast to the underpricing. Savings banks have a lower discount, and thus
a higher willingness to pay, than private banks, yet do not end up paying more. Most
of these differences seem to be explained by the stopout deviation regression. For
example, savings banks have a significantly smaller stopout deviation than private
banks. So even though they have lower discounts, they do not end up paying more.
The award ratio regression shows that this variable tends to decrease in bank size
and the normalized net excess reserve. In other words, smaller and shorter banks
are relatively more aggressive within an auction than large and less short banks.
The coefficients on the two interaction variables, show that as imbalance increases,
a bank's aggressiveness in the auction gets relatively smaller the longer and larger
it is. This supports the evidence from the underpricing regression that smaller
and shorter banks are more vulnerable to liquidity squeezes, given that imbalance
measures the potential for a squeeze.
The demand to reserves requirements regression shows that a bank's total de-
mand relative to its reserves is decreasing in the normalized net excess reserves, i.e.,
banks demand relatively more the shorter they are.
To summarize, the panel regressions confirm the finding from our cross-sectional
analysis that banks pay more for liquidity the smaller they are. In addition, the
panel regressions show that liquidity positions affect the price paid for liquidity and
the willingness to pay. But it is not just a bank's own position that matters; it is
especially how liquidity is distributed across banks. The more imbalance there is,
the more are banks willing to pay and the more do they end up paying, especially
29
the shorter and smaller they are.
5.3 Panel Regressions with Heckman Correction
The Heckman selection model combines a selection mechanism for participating in
the main refinancing operation with a regression model. Indexing banks by i and
operations by j, the selection equation is
z
ij
=  wij
+ µij
. (6)
The regression model is
yij
=  xij
+ ij
, (7)
where (µij
, ij
) are assumed to be bivariate normal [0, 0, 1,  , ].
z
ij
is not observed; the variable is observed as zij
= 1 if z
ij
> 0 and 0 otherwise
with probabilities Prob(zij
= 1) = ( wij
) and Prob(zij
= 0) = 1-( wij
). zi
=
1 indicates that the bank participates and  is the standardized normal cumulative
distribution function.
In the selected sample,
E[yij
|zij
= 1] =  xij
+  ( wij
) (8)
The model is estimated by maximum likelihood, see Greene (2000), which pro-
vides consistent, asymptotically efficient parameter estimates. Standard errors are
adjusted for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of variance and
are clustered at the auction level.
The set of explanatory variables, x, in the regression model are the same as in
the panel regressions in the previous subsection. In the selection equation, we use
two additional variables, namely maturing repo and last auction. Maturing repo is
1 if the bank won some units two operations ago, and last auction is the aggregate
underpricing in the previous main refinancing operation. We expect that a bank is
more likely to participate if it has to refinance (maturing repo is 1). The results are
virtually the same with or without the variable last auction.
30
The Heckman model is run on the full dataset, including bidding banks and
non-bidding banks. Results are in Table 9. Panel (a) presents the regression model,
panel (b) the selection model, and panel (c) provides statistics on the parameters.
Comparing panel (a) to the plain panel regression in Table 8, we see very few notable
differences. The variables that were significant remain so, though sometimes with
altered p-levels, and the coefficients are very close to what they were before. Out-
side of the demand to reserves requirement regression, the only exception appears
to be ln(assets) in the relative discount regression, which loses significance. New
variables do not become significant in any of the regressions. The conclusions from
the previous subsection remain intact.
In panel (b), we see that the selection equation is virtually the same for the
different independent variables. This illustrates its robustness. We note that in-
creased bank size is associated with a larger likelihood to participate, as is being a
savings bank. Cooperatives and foreign banks are less likely to participate. With
respect to liquidity status, we see that a larger imbalance is associated with a larger
participation rate, consistent with the interpretation that this variable is associated
with squeezes; the more likely a squeeze is, the more important it is to participate
in order to cover one's short position, or possibly being able to squeeze. A bank is
also more likely to participate when the size ratio is large. This is not surprising,
since a larger relative auction size is indicative of an increased need for liquidity in
the banking system. Banks are also more likely to participate when the swap spread
is large, perhaps because this is associated with larger underpricing. A negative
swap spread is, not surprisingly, associated with less participation. An increase in
volatility and expected auction size are both associated with an increased likelihood
of bidding. The positive coefficients on maturing repo and last auction confirm that
banks are more likely to participate if they have a refinancing need and also when
the previous auction was highly underpriced.
Panel c reports the different parameters for the Heckman estimation, i.e. , ,
and . The results suggest that these parameters are significant for each of the
31
estimations, except for the underpricing estimation. In particular, the correlation of
the residuals in the bidding and performance model and the selection model, which
is captured by , is significant at the 5% level. This suggests that it is important
to use the Heckman approach to take into account the decision whether to submit
a bid for the analysis of how bidders submit their bids. Nevertheless, as we have
seen, the results from the Heckman panel regression are virtually the same as in the
plain panel regression.
6 Conclusion
This paper documents that the price of liquidity systematically depends on bank
characteristics and market conditions. We specifically test three hypotheses, which
are derived from economic theory, and find the following results. First, our findings
are consistent with the existence of periodically occurring liquidity squeezes. A
greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks is associated with a rise in
the price of liquidity, relative to the benchmark, as predicted by the theoretical
work by Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004). Furthermore, the shorter a bank is the
more adversely it is affected by an increase in imbalance, ceteris paribus. Since the
sample period of this paper is a time of relative normalcy in the interbank markets,
this shows that liquidity squeezes are not just a crisis phenomenon.
Second, we document a systematic relation between bank size and the price of
liquidity. Controlling for a variety of factors, we find that larger banks pay less than
do smaller banks. This effect is even more pronounced when there is an increase
in the imbalance of the liquidity positions. Smaller banks thus appear to be more
vulnerable to a liquidity squeeze, ceteris paribus. This may also help explain why
smaller banks tend to be relatively less short than larger banks prior to refinancing
operations.
Third, we find that membership in a formal relationship lending network does
not reduce the price a bank pays for liquidity. German savings and cooperative
32
banks, which formally belong to these networks, do not pay less than other banks,
which are not part of these networks. Cooperative banks even bid and pay more
than other banks. This gives rise to the notion that these formal networks may
induce banks to free-ride on the efforts of other banks in the network (as discussed
in the Introduction). An alternative view is that cooperatives and savings banks
that participate in the main refinancing operations do so because they experience
rationing by their respective networks. This may carry stigma in the interbank
market, giving them an increased willingness to pay in open market operations.
There are several ways this line of research can be broadened. For example,
a pertinent question is whether banks with poor collateral or low quality balance
sheets are more exposed to adverse liquidity conditions and therefore bid and pay
more in the primary market. That underpricing in the main refinancing operations
is increasing in the size of the operation is consistent with the view that different col-
lateral have different opportunity costs. Data on individual bank collateral holdings,
however, is very hard to obtain.
Another important issue is how the effects we have uncovered would play out
during a crisis period. For example, that small banks are more adversely affected by
increases in the liquidity imbalance in the banking sector, ceteris paribus, suggests
that small banks would be more vulnerable in a crisis. On the other hand, since
small banks tend to be less short than large banks, it is possible that the net effect
of a crisis may be worse for large banks than small ones. Thus, while our findings
are consistent with the view that large banks have better access to the interbank
market for liquidity than smaller banks, it is not clear how they would fare if this
market would seize up.
Finally, our finding that there are imperfections in the market for liquidity even
during times of normalcy leaves us with the hypothesis that the current crisis rep-
resents a flaring up of these imperfections. This is an important issue to settle for
future research.

Table 2: Liquidity Status by Bank Type: Non-Bidders
Descriptive statistics on the major variables for six types of banks as classified by the Deutsche
Bundesbank: Private banks, savings banks, cooperatives, foreign banks, Landesbanks, and
cooperative central banks. (Note that there are no non-bidders among Landesbanks and
cooperative central banks.) The liquidity variables are defined in Section 3.1. All variables
are collected for each bank the day before each auction. Note that for non-bidders, there is
no difference between gross and net excess reserves as there never is a maturing repo.

Table 4: Liquidity Status by Assets
Banks are divided into 12 size groups by assets. The liquidity variables are defined in Section 3.1. We calculate means of
each variable for each bank across all operations. We then report the mean across banks within each group. Specifically,
for each size group, means of each variable are calculated first for each auction. The reported statistics are then calculated
across auctions for each size group. This corrects for censoring bias (due to changing composition of bidders over time).
Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are excluded.

Table 7: Market Condition and Interaction Variables
Descriptive statistics of explanatory market condition and interaction variables. Imbalance is
the standard deviation of the normalized net excess reserves of all banks before a given auc-
tion. Imbalance×nex and imbalance×ln(assets) are interaction variables for which imbalance
is multiplied by the normalized net excess reserves and log of assets, respectively, for each
bidder in a given auction. (Note: nex denotes normalized net excess reserves.) Size ratio is
the ratio of the expected auction size in auction t and the realized auction size in auction t-2.
Expected auction size is the liquidity neutral amount, which is computed from the liquidity
figures announced by the ECB the afternoon on the day prior to the auctions. Swap spread
is the difference between the two week swap rate and the minimum bid rate at 9:15 a.m./
on the auction day. Volatility of swap rate is the conditional volatility of the two week swap
rate on auction days (see Appendix 2).

Appendix 2: Volatility of Swap Rate
To estimate the conditional volatility of the two week swap rate, we apply a
modified GARCH(1,1) model (Bollerslev, 1986) to daily rate changes. We have
considered various calendar effects, as in Hamilton (1996), but not all are in the
final specification. Our model is based on that in Nyborg et al (2002). However,
our final specification has a somewhat better fit in the period we are studying as
compared to their's.
51
Table 10: Conditional Volatility of Swap Rate
This table reports the results of the conditional volatility estimation of the two-week
swap rate, using a modified GARCH(1,1) model. Panel (a) gives the coefficients of
the mean equation, while panel (b) gives the coefficients of the variance equation.
Slope is the difference between 12 and 1 month Euribor. (-1) stands for the preceding
day's observation Downswap takes the value 1 if the swap rate fell the previous day
and 0 otherwise. ECBMEET(-1) is 1 if there was a meeting of the ECB Governing
Council the previous day. Underbid(-1) is 1 if there was an underbid auction. (An
auction is underbid if total demand is less than the liquidity neutral amount. For this
purpose, total demand is the demand of all, not only German, bidders. See Nyborg
et al (2002) for a discussion of underbid auctions.) Endmonth takes the value 1 if
the day is the last business day of a month and 0 otherwise, Endres takes the value
1 if the day is the last business day of a reserve maintenance period and 0 otherwise.
Endres(-1) is a dummy variable for the first business day in a maintenance period.
Mainrepo takes the value 1 if the day is an auction day (main refinancing operation)
and 0 otherwise.
