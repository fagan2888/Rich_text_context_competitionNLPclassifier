Small Primary Care Physician
Practices Have Low Rates Of
Preventable Hospital Admissions
ABSTRACT Nearly two-thirds of US office-based physicians work in
practices of fewer than seven physicians. It is often assumed that larger
practices provide better care, although there is little evidence for or
against this assumption. What is the relationship between practice size--
and other practice characteristics, such as ownership or use of medical
home processes--and the quality of care? We conducted a national survey
of 1,045 primary care­based practices with nineteen or fewer physicians
to determine practice characteristics. We used Medicare data to calculate
practices' rate of potentially preventable hospital admissions (ambulatory
care­sensitive admissions). Compared to practices with 10­19 physicians,
practices with 1­2 physicians had 33 percent fewer preventable
admissions, and practices with 3­9 physicians had 27 percent fewer.
Physician-owned practices had fewer preventable admissions than
hospital-owned practices. In an era when health care reform appears to
be driving physicians into larger organizations, it is important to
measure the comparative performance of practices of all sizes, to learn
more about how small practices provide patient care, and to learn more
about the types of organizational structures--such as independent
practice associations--that may make it possible for small practices to
share resources that are useful for improving the quality of care.
The Affordable Care Act and initia-
tives by private health insurance
companies are driving major
changes in the ownership of physi-
cian practices, the incentives prac-
tices face to improve the care they provide, and
the processes practices use to improve care.
Many practices are consolidating into larger
medical groups.1 Many others are shifting from
physician ownership to hospital ownership.2­5
Practices are increasingly subjected to pay-for-
performance and public reporting programs6,7
and are being encouraged to implement process-
es used in patient-centered medical homes.8,9
Despite these changes, and despite calls to focus
more attention on physician practices,1,10,11 rela-
tively little is known about the comparative per-
formance of different types of physician practice
structures.5,12­15
We used data from a large, unique data set, the
National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Phy-
sician Practices (NSSMPP),16 to analyze the as-
sociation between an important outcome of
care--the ambulatory care­sensitive admission
rate--and key characteristics of physician prac-
tices, including their size and ownership, the
processes they use to improve care, and the ex-
ternal incentives they are given to improve qual-
ity and control costs.
The NSSMPP focused on primary care­based
practices with nineteen or fewer physicians. It
has recently been estimated that 83.2 percent of

office-based physicians in the United States are
in practices of ten or fewer physicians: 38.6 per-
cent in solo or two-physician practices, 26.4 per-
cent in practices with three to five physicians,
and 18.2 percent in practices with six to ten
physicians.5 Other studies estimate lower but
still very substantial percentages of physicians
in small and medium-size practices.1,17
Ambulatory care­sensitive admissions are de-
fined by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) as admissions for condi-
tions such as congestive heart failure for which
good primary care may prevent admission.18
There were more than 3.9 million such admis-
sions of adults to US hospitals in 2010, at a cost
of $31.9 billion.19 As many as 40 percent may have
been preventable.20
Study Data And Methods
Survey Sample And Survey Instrument
The NSSMPP involved forty-minute telephone
surveys, conducted between July 2007 and
March 2009, with the physician leader or admin-
istrator of each practice in a national sample of
practices with 1­19 physicians.16,21 No publicly
available database of US physician practices ex-
ists. We used a comprehensive private database,
the IMS Healthcare Organizational Services da-
tabase, to create the population from which we
sampled practices. This national database in-
cludes nearly 800,000 US physicians linked to
the practices in which they work. IMS data are
widely accepted and have been used in many
studies published in peer-reviewed jour-
nals.16,21­23
Practices were eligible for the survey if at least
60 percent of their physicians were some combi-
nation of adult primary care providers, cardiol-
ogists, endocrinologists, and pulmonologists.
We included only practices with these specialties
because they typically provide ongoing care for
patients with one or more of four major chronic
illnesses: asthma, congestive heart failure, dia-
betes, and depression. Details of the sampling
process are available in online Appendix A.24
A total of 1,745 practices responded to the
survey, for a response rate of 63.2 percent (Ap-
pendixA).24 For thisarticlewe analyzeddata only
from the 1,045 practices that included at least
33 percent primary care physicians, were not
community health centers, and had patients as-
signed to them in 2008 (Appendix A).24
The survey instrument was drawn, with minor
updates, from the instrument used in our prior
national survey of large medical groups.25,26 The
instrument includes questions on practice size;
specialty mix; ownership; patient demographics
and insurance; and practice exposure to pay-for-
performance, public reporting, and acceptance
of financial risk for the cost of patients' care. It
also includes questions on practices' use of clini-
cal information technology and of care manage-
ment processes such as disease registries and
patient reminders.
Identifying Physicians In The Surveyed
Practices The NSSMPP did not provide the
names of physicians in the practices. Using
Web searches and telephone calls, we identified
3,010 physicians who worked in the 1,045 eligi-
ble practices.We identified each physician's spe-
cialty using Medicare claims and categorized
each as primary care (general internal medicine,
family practice,general practice,orgeriatrics) or
specialist.
Linking The Survey To Medicare Claims
Data We obtained Medicare claims for 2008
for 999,990 beneficiaries who met the following
criteria: The beneficiary had at least one Medi-
care Outpatient or Carrier File claim filed by at
least one of the NSSMPP physicians in 2008; the
beneficiary was at least sixty-five years old and
during 2008 had both Part A and Part B coverage
continuously; and was not in the End Stage Re-
nal Disease Program or Medicare Advantage.
We attributed each beneficiary to the physician
with whom the beneficiary had a plurality of
outpatient evaluation and management visits.
If this physician was not in the NSSMPP sample,
the beneficiary was not included in the analyses.
In case of ties between two NSSMPP physicians,
the beneficiary was assigned to the physician
(if any) who was a primary care physician. Fur-
ther details about breaking ties are in online
Appendix B.24 Beneficiaries were attributed to
the practice of their NSSMPP physician. In total,
284,401 beneficiaries were attributed to the
1,045 practices.
Variables
AMBULATORY CARE­SENSITIVE ADMIS-
SIONS: Our unit of analysis was the beneficiary.
Our outcome variable was the number of ambu-
latory care­sensitive admissions for that benefi-
ciary in 2008. Appendix C24 shows the twelve
types of such admissions, as defined by AHRQ,18
that were included. We obtained Medicare data
only for beneficiaries who were alive throughout
2008, so death was not a competing risk for an
ambulatory care­sensitive admission.
PRACTICE STRUCTURE: We classified practic-
es as physician or hospital owned and classified
theminto three size categories (1­2, 3­9, and 10­
19 physicians). We also included a variable for
the percentage of primary care physicians in the
practice.
PROCESSES USED TO IMPROVE CARE: Our
survey instrument included forty-five questions
designed to provide information on the extent to

which practices used processes that were in-
tended to improve the quality of care and that
are integral to medical homes.16 These included
theuse of primary care teams, processes aimed at
coordinating patient care, clinical information
technology (for example, electronic prescrib-
ing), guideline-based reminders for providers
at the point of care, and electronic communica-
tion between providers and patients. A patient-
centered medical home score was calculated for
each practice as a percentage based on the proc-
esses used by the practice. Details of the ques-
tions included and our method for calculating
the patient-centered medical home score have
been previously published16 and are shown in
Appendix D.24
EXTERNAL INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE CARE:
We categorized practices as having a public re-
porting incentive if they indicated that data on
their clinical quality or patient satisfaction were
publicly reported by external entities such as
health insurance plans.We categorized practices
as having a pay-for-performance incentive if they
reported that they had an opportunity to receive
additional income from health plans or other
external entities for scoring well on measures
of clinical quality or patient satisfaction, exclud-
ing Medicare's physician reporting program.We
categorized practices as having no financial risk
for the cost of hospital care for their patients;
risk for 10 percent or fewer of the practice's pa-
tients; or risk for more than 10 percent of the
practice's patients.
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: From the Medi-
care Master Beneficiary Summary File, we in-
cluded measures of beneficiaries' age, sex, race
or ethnicity, and whether the beneficiary was a
"dual eligible" (that is, was covered by both Med-
icaid and Medicare). For each of the twenty-five
chronic conditions included in the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic
Condition Warehouse, we included a variable for
whetherthebeneficiaryhadbeen diagnosedwith
the condition prior to 2008.
Statistical Analyses We calculated descrip-
tive statistics and estimated the bivariate rela-
tionship between key variables.We then estimat-
ed two negative binomial regression models,
using the beneficiary as the unit of analysis. Neg-
ative binomial models are appropriate when the
outcome is a count variable and the variance is
larger than the mean. Model 1 estimated the
relationship between practice size, ownership,
and percentage of primary care physicians and
the number of ambulatory care­sensitive admis-
sions a beneficiary had in 2008. The second mod-
el added the patient-centered medical home
score and the incentive variables. Model 2 asks,
for example, "What is the strength of the associ-
ation between practice size and ambulatory
care­sensitive admissions, holding the patient-
centered medical home score and other variables
constant?" However, the score and other varia-
bles vary by practice size, so we included model 1
because it may be of interest to test the strength
of the association between practice size and am-
bulatory care­sensitive admissions without
holding the patient-centered medical home
score and other variables constant.
In both models we controlled for beneficiary
characteristics, the hospital referral region in
which the practice was located, the six-month
period during which the practice responded to
the survey, and the percentage of primary care
physicians in the practice. Analyses were weight-
ed to account for the probability of selection
for the reporting practices, adjusted for non-
response, and controlled to population distribu-
tions. Standard errors are robust to clustering at
the level of the primary sampling units.
The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Weill Cornell Medical College.
Analyses were performed using the statistical
software Stata, version 12.0.
Limitations Our study is unique in its scale
and in the number of important explanatory var-
iables that it includes. However, it has eight lim-
itations.
First, although it is based on a very large, ran-
domly selected sample of small and medium-size
primary care­based practices in the United
States, we cannot claim that it is a precisely rep-
resentative sample, because no "gold standard"
data set exists that contains the population of US
physician practices.
Second, our study does not include practices
that are primarily composed of specialist physi-
cians. Third, our study does not include practices
with twenty or more physicians. However, most
physicians work in practices with fewer than
twenty physicians. Although it is possible that
much larger practices would have lower ambula-
tory care­sensitive admission rates, a recent
study27 found higher readmission rates in very
large practices. The national ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rate for practices of all sizes
is 5.5 per hundred patients per year.20 This rate
was 5.1 for practices in our study with one to two
physicians and 4.3 for practices with three to
nine physicians (Exhibit 1).
Fourth, our data on practice characteristics
and incentives are self-reported by a single
knowledgeable leader of each practice. Fifth,
our measure of patient-centered medical home
processes, although extensive, does not include
all practice characteristics currently used in pro-
grams recognizing practices as patient-centered
medical homes. However, a strength of our study

is that it included a reasonably representative
national sample of practices. Other studies of
the patient-centered medical home have includ-
ed only practices that volunteered to participate
and, therefore, may have differed systematically
from other practices.
Sixth, our incentive results should be inter-
preted with the caution that we did not measure
the intensity of the pay-for-performance or pub-
lic reporting incentives and had only a partial
measure of the extent to which practices had
an incentive to control the cost of care. Seventh,
our data come from 2008. It is possible that since
then larger practices have done more to reduce
preventable admissions. Finally, our study is ob-
servational and demonstrates only an associa-
tion, not necessarily a causal relationship, be-
tween the variables of interest and ambulatory
care­sensitive admissions.
Study Results
Practice Size, Ownership, And Patient Popu-
lations Most practices were in the 1­2 and 3­9
physician size range (Exhibit 1). Hospitals
owned 16.7 percent of practices. The smallest
(1­2 physician) practices cared for significantly
higher percentages of dual-eligible and racial or
ethnic minority patients and for patients who
had more chronic conditions (Exhibit 2), com-
pared to the practices with 3­9 physicians.
Use Of Patient-Centered Medical Home
Processes The largest practices (10­19 physi-
cians) used significantly more patient-centered
medical home processes than the smallest prac-
tices, with 1­2 physicians (24.1 percent vs.
19.1 percent of possible processes), although
not more than the practices with 3­9 physicians
(25.6 percent). Hospital-owned practices used
more processes than physician-owned practices
(27.7 percent versus 21.2 percent). Practices
with incentives from pay-for-performance and

public reporting programs used significantly
more patient-centered medical home processes
than practices without these incentives, as did
practices that took some financial risk for the
cost of hospital care for at least 10 percent of
the practice's patients. Practices in the lowest
quartile of use of patient-centered medical home
processes used 6.6 percent of processes com-
pared to a mean of 46.2 percent of processes
in the highest quartile (Exhibit 1).
Ambulatory Care­Sensitive Admissions
The mean ambulatory care­sensitive admission
rate was 4.6 per hundred beneficiaries per year
(Exhibit 1). In unadjusted, bivariate analyses,
practices with 1­2 and 3­9 physicians had rates
of 5.1 and 4.3 per hundred patients per year,
compared to 6.1 for practices of 10­19 physicians
(Exhibit 1). Practices owned by physicians had
significantly lower ambulatory care­sensitive
admission rates than those owned by hospitals
(4.3 versus 6.4). Practices also had lower rates if
they werein thehighest quartileof use of patient-
centered medical home processes.
Exhibit 3 presents the adjusted rates of ambu-
latory care­sensitive admissions per hundred
patients per year after controlling for other var-
iables. Model 1 examines the associations of
practice size and ownership with the rate. Model
2 examines these associations as well as associ-
ations with the patient-centered medical home
score, pay-for-performance incentives, accep-
tance of risk for the cost of hospital care, and
public reporting. Practices with 1­2 physicians
had a significantly lower ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rate than practices with
10­19 physicians in both multivariate regression
models (4.31 versus 6.47 in model 2). Practices
with 3­9 physicians had rates that were much
lower than those with 10­19 physicians and
slightly higher than those with 1­2 physicians.
In both models, physician-owned practices had
ambulatory care­sensitive admission rates that
were lower than hospital-owned practices--
significantly so in model 2 (4.63 versus 5.31).
Neither the patient-centered medical home
score, nor pay-for-performance incentives, nor
the acceptance of risk for the cost of hospital care
for the practice's patients was significantly asso-

ciated with the ambulatory care­sensitive admis-
sion rate (Exhibit 3). Practices exposed to public
reporting had somewhat higher rates.
As a sensitivity analysis, we ran both models
while excluding the 10 percent of beneficiaries
who had only one claim with a physician in the
NSSMPP sample. Results of this analysis were
virtually identical--the same variables were sta-
tistically significant--to the results just pre-
sented (data not shown).
Discussion
In our large national study of small and medium-
size primary care­based practices, practices with
1­2 physicians had ambulatory care­sensitive
admission rates that were 33 percent lower than
those of the largest small practices (having 10­19
physicians). Practices with 3­9 physicians also
had rates that were lower than the rates for the
largest small practices, although slightly higher
than the rates for practices with 1­2 physicians.
These findings were unexpected, since small
practices presumably have fewer resources to
hire staff to help them implement systematic
processes to improve the care they pro-
vide.5,16,25,28 Larger practices did have higher pa-
tient-centered medical home scores than the
practices with 1­2 physicians (though not higher
than those with 3­9 physicians) and so appear to
use more such processes, but these higher scores
were not associated with lower ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rates in multivariate an-
alyses.
Possible Reasons For The Differences Our
cross-sectional analysis cannot determine
whether there is a causal relationship between
practice size or ownership and ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rates. Larger practices are
likely to have more resources to implement or-
ganized processes to improve care, and these
processes are likely to result in better perfor-
mance on process measures of care, such as ap-
propriate test ordering for people with diabe-
tes.29,30 But it is possible that small practices
have characteristics that are not easily measured

SOURCE Authors' analyses using data from the National Survey of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices and Medicare claims. NOTES N ¼ 284; 401 patients. The
values shown are the adjusted rates of ambulatory care­sensitive admissions (ACSAs). Quartiles are arrayed from lowest scores (quartile 1) to highest scores (quartile 4).
CI is confidence interval. aModel 1 tests the association of practice size and practice ownership with ACSAs. The model controls for beneficiary characteristics (including
the beneficiary's chronic conditions, age, sex, race or ethnicity, and dual-eligible status), the hospital referral region in which the practice was located, the six-month period
during which the practice responded to the survey, and the percentage of primary care physicians in the practice. Coefficients for all variables in the model are displayed in
Appendix E (see Note 24 in text). bModel 2 tests the association of practice size, practice ownership, external incentives, and the practice's medical home score with
ACSAs, controlling for the same variables as in model 1. cNot applicable (these variables were not included in Model 1).

but result in important outcomes, such as fewer
ambulatory care­sensitive admissions. For ex-
ample, there is evidence that patients in smaller
practices are better able to get appointments
when they want them and better able to reach
their physician via telephone, compared to larg-
er practices.15,31,32 It is also possible that physi-
cians, patients, and staff know each other better
in small practices, and that these closer connec-
tions result in fewer avoidable admissions.5,15,31
We cannot fully exclude the possibility that the
largest practices, which had a somewhat higher
percentage of specialists, had patients who were
sicker and, therefore, more likely to have an am-
bulatory care­sensitive admission. However, we
controlled for the percentage of specialists in
practices and for patients' demographic charac-
teristics and comorbidities, and we found that
the smallest practices cared for a significantly
higher percentage of dual-eligible patients and
for patients with more comorbidities.
Other Findings To our knowledge, no study is
directly comparable to ours, but two studies had
results that are relevant and broadly consistent
with ours, although their methods differed.
Michael McWilliams and colleagues found that
smaller practices had slightly lower readmission
rates (1.9 percent lower) than medium-size and
large practices.27 The size categories in that study
were quite large (the mean number of physicians
in small, medium, and large practices, respec-
tively, was seven, forty-three, and 217), ambula-
tory care­sensitive admission rates were not an-
alyzed, and patient-centered medical home
scores and pay-for-performance and public re-
porting incentives were not included. John
Kralewski and colleagues, in a study of Medicare
patients with diabetes, found that smaller prac-
tices had fewer ambulatory care­sensitive admis-
sions and lower overall costs of care.33 Use of
patient-centered medical home processes and
incentives faced by the practices were not includ-
ed in the analyses. Practices in this study ranged
from 5 to 750 physicians, and size was measured
as a continuous variable, so the performance of
small practices in this study is not clear. In a
study with results that differed from ours, twenty
very large practices (250­1,300 physicians) had
lower ambulatory care­sensitive admission rates
compared to the average for all other physicians
in their hospital referral regions.29 These practic-
es are self-selected members of the Council of
Accountable Physician Practices and may not
be representative of large groups in general.
Physician-owned practices had lower ambula-
tory care­sensitive admission rates than hospi-
tal-owned practices in both bivariate and multi-
variate analyses--approximately 13 percent
lower in multivariate analysis, although the ef-
fect was somewhat smaller and did not reach
statistical significance in model 1. Kralewski
and colleagues found higher ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rates for patients with
diabetes in hospital-owned practices,33 and
McWilliams and colleagues found higher read-
mission rates in large hospital-owned practices
but did not analyze rates in small and medium-
size hospital-owned practices.27
Hospital ownership would be expected to re-
sult in a lower ambulatory care­sensitive admis-
sion rate if hospitals provided additional re-
sources to practices to hire staff and implement
systematic processes to improve care.5,16 In fact,
consistent with prior studies,16,25,34 we found that
hospital-owned practices used more patient-
centered medical home processes than physi-
cian-owned practices. But these practices never-
theless had higher ambulatory care­sensitive
admission rates. Hospital acquisition of a prac-
ticemight disruptlongstandingreferral relation-
ships between the practice's physicians and spe-
cialists outside the practice and might lead to
other changes that result in worse performance
by the practice and higher ambulatory care­
sensitive admission rates.5
We did not find an association between the
ambulatory care­sensitive admission rate and
the use of patient-centered medical home proc-
esses or between that rate and pay-for-perfor-
mance or public reporting incentives. Prior re-
search has resulted in inconsistent findings
regarding the relationship between patient-
centered medical homes and physician practice
performance8,35­39 and between incentives and
physician practice performance.7,40­44 We found
that practices subject to public reporting of per-
formance had somewhat higher ambulatory
care­sensitive admission rates. The reason for
this is not clear, although it should be noted that
these rates are not typically used as a publicly
reported measure of practice performance.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that the common assump-
tion that bigger is better45 should not be accepted
without question, at least in practices of nine-
teen or fewer physicians. Given physician prac-
tices' fundamental importance as the base from
which most health care delivery emanates, it is
surprising that so little information exists on the
comparative performance of different types of
practices.12 Evidence on the relationship of struc-
tures to processes to outcomes in physician prac-
tices is scarce. More research effort and funding
would help to close this information gap.
Meanwhile, public policy makers and health
insurance company executives might consider

policies that support organizations that help
small practices share resources--such as nurse
care managers for patients with chronic ill-
nesses.46 Independent practice associations,
for example, have been shown to increase the
number of patient-centered medical home proc-
esses provided to patients of small and medium-
size practices.23 These organizations might pro-
vide a viable alternative, in the era of health care
reform, for physicians who do not want to be-
come employed by hospitals and do not have the
desire or the opportunity to join a large medical
group (large groups do not exist in most US
communities). The Medicare Shared Savings
and Pioneer accountable care organization
(ACO) programs, as well as private health insur-
ance companies, contract with independent
practice associations. In addition, the Medicare
Shared Savings Program offers an Advance
Payment Program that provides large loans to
develop ACO infrastructure to relatively small
independent practice associations or medical
groups with less than $50 million in annual rev-
enue. Thirty-five Advance Payment contracts
have been signed to date. Regional Extension
Centers--similar to those funded by the Office
of the National Coordinator for Health Informa-
tion Technology--could also be of use in helping
small practices implement organized processes
to improve their quality of care.47­49
Physicians in small practices have no negoti-
ating leverage with health insurers, so insurers
typically pay them much lower rates for their
services than they pay to physicians who practice
in larger groups or are employed by hospitals.
This policy might be penny wise and pound fool-
ish if it drives small practices out of existence
and if further research confirms that small prac-
tices have lower ambulatory care­sensitive ad-
mission rates, and possibly lower overall costs
for patients' care, than larger groups.
Leaders of hospitals and large medical groups
that absorb physician practices might consider
whether there are advantages to trying to pre-
serve the small practice environment within
their organizations, while providing resources
to help small practices proactively improve care
for their populations of patients.
Small practices have many obvious disadvan-
tages. It would be a mistake to romanticize them.
But it might be an even greater mistake to ignore
them, and the lessons that might be learned from
them, as larger and larger provider organiza-
tions clash to gain advantageous positions in
the new world of payment and delivery system
changes catalyzed by health care reform.
