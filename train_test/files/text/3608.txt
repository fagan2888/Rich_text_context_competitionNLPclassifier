Abstract: Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that indirect aggression during
adolescence is a strategy to compete with same-sex peer rivals for resources, status, and
mating opportunities. We collected survey data on 143 young adults to determine
retrospectively, the amount of indirect aggressive behavior they perpetrated and the amount
of indirect victimization they experienced in middle school and high school. We also
collected information about reproductive opportunities such as age at first sexual
intercourse and number of lifetime sex partners to determine whether aggression or
victimization could be used to predict measures of reproductive opportunity. We
performed a principal components analysis to develop factors from 16 aggression and
victimization variables. Results indicate that females who reported indirect aggression
toward peers had earlier ages at first sexual intercourse and females who were more
victimized in adolescence experienced later ages at first sexual intercourse. We discuss
these results in terms of intrasexual competition and evolutionary theory.

Introduction
Peer aggression and victimization is widespread in children and adolescents
between 11 and 16 years old (Nansel, Craig, Overpeck, Saluja, and Ruan, 2004). The
multi-national Health Behavior in School Aged Children Study shows that no fewer than
9% and as many as 54% of school aged children from the 25 nations studied are involved
in aggressive acts toward peers, are victimized by peers, or both (Nansel et al., 2004). The
apparent ubiquity of these behaviors in children and adolescents has made their study and
prevention important educational and public health goals (Berger, 2007; Hawley, Little,
Indirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(1). 2010. -50-
and Rodkin, 2007; Olweus, 1993; Smith, Pepler, and Rigby, 2004). While developmental
and educational psychologists have dominated the study and interpretation of these
behaviors, several researchers have proposed that these behaviors can and should be
understood from the perspective of evolutionary theory (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002;
Hawley, 1999; Sutton, Smith and Swettenham, 1999; Vaillancourt, 2005).
Two recent studies use evolutionary principles to link peer victimization in
adolescence with mating and intrasexual competition. Leenaars, Dane, and Marini (2008)
found that female adolescents who considered themselves attractive were at higher risk for
indirect victimization (e.g., hurtful rumor spreading) than their non-victimized peers. The
authors interpret these results as a form of intrasexual competition between female
adolescents whereby attractive girls become targets of victimization by other girls who are
competing for mating opportunities. This interpretation follows the logic that males favor
attractive females (Buss, 1988, 1989) and females compete with each other for high quality,
attractive mates (Buss, 1988; Buss and Dedden, 1990). Indirect aggression may become a
behavioral/functional tool to lower the competitive value of rival girls by signaling the
victim's promiscuity and possible infidelity to potential male mates (Buss and Dedden,
1990). The indirect nature of the behavior reduces the chance of physical harm which is a
predicted element of female aggressive competition (Campbell, 1999). Victimized females
may not suffer in number of available short-term sex partners, but may be hindered in their
competition for genetically superior long-term mates due to reputational damage (Buss and
Schmitt, 1993).
Gallup, O'Brien, White and Wilson (2009) found that 85% of victimization in
adolescence is directed toward same-sex peers as predicted by results from large school
samples from Europe and Australia (Olweus, 1993; Rigby 2002). Gallup et al. (2009)
showed that female victims of indirect aggression started having sex at earlier ages and had
more lifetime sex partners in early adulthood than their peers who were either not
victimized or less victimized in adolescence. The opposite relationship was true for males,
as victimization in adolescence was negatively correlated with lifetime number of sex
partners and the rate of sex partners per year.
Intrasexual aggression is one of many functional and potentially adaptive responses to
competition with mating rivals and the retention of opposite-sex partners (Buss and
Shackelford, 1997). From a functional point of view, researchers have found that
aggressive behavior towards peers lowers self-esteem and self-regard in victimized children
and adolescents (Egan and Perry, 1998; Salmivalli, Kaukiainen, Kaistaniemi, and
Lagerspetz, 1999; Rigby, 2002). In adolescent females, this reduction in self-esteem could
lead to (1) reduced dating/mating opportunities due to marginalization and ostracism or (2)
to increased short-term sexual encounters as these teens seek short-term affairs that boost
self-esteem (Greiling and Buss, 2000). Numerous short-term mating opportunities favor
male reproductive strategies but may be costly to females who could be perceived as
promiscuous or potentially unfaithful to males.
Other researchers have shown that self-esteem is lower in children and adolescents who
are (1) victimized, (2) aggressive toward peers, or (3) considered both bullies and victims
(Rigby and Cox, 1996; O'Moore and Kirkham, 2001). High self-esteem appears to protect
children and adolescents from both perpetrating and being victimized by these negative
social interactions with peers (O'Moore and Kirkham, 2001). Adolescents with high self-

esteem may compete with peers using more prosocial behavior and may be better able to
avoid aggressive interactions. High self-esteem may play a role in the disparate
reproductive strategies of males and females.
In adolescent males, aggressive behavior is employed to maintain status in the social
dominance hierarchy (Hawley, 1999; Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002; Pellegrini and
Bartini, 2000). Those who are victimized descend in the hierarchy and have less access to
resources including mating opportunities. Cross-culturally, females tend to prefer high
status males who control or have the potential to control resources (Buss, 1988). In
adolescent females, however, the reproductive value of social dominance is the ability to be
choosy about dating and mating partners and priority access to resources such as alliances,
friendships, and information (Hawley, 2007). In this study we examine the interaction
between reproductive opportunities in adulthood and both indirect peer aggression and
indirect peer victimization during adolescence. Previous work has shown that victimization
and aggression in adolescence are not mutually exclusive and therefore need to be
considered together. Survey data from young adults were collected to test three
hypotheses.
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1. Females who report higher than average indirect aggression towards
same-sex peers in adolescence will also report earlier ages at first sexual intercourse.
Recent research has shown that mating motivates increased intrasexual indirect
aggression in young adult females (Griskevicius, Tybur, Gangestad, Perea, Shapiro, and
Kenrick, 2009). If indirect aggression toward same-sex peers has an adaptive evolutionary
origin by increasing social dominance or by lowering a victim's self-esteem, we expect
indirectly aggressive females to achieve a measure of reproductive benefit from these
behaviors. In fact, several researchers have found that girls who used indirect aggression
towards peers were more likely to be nominated as potential dating partners and were more
likely to begin dating at earlier ages (Connolly, Pepler, Craig, and Taradash, 2000;
Pellegrini and Long, 2003; Vaillancourt, 2005). In females, the initiation of dating and
sexual intercourse at an early age increases the length of the reproductive window and may
subsequently increase total fertility (Wood, 1994). Therefore, we expect females who used
indirect aggression during adolescence to report earlier ages at first sexual intercourse than
less aggressive peers.
Hypothesis 2. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict fewer than average
sex partners and later than average ages at first intercourse in males.
We expect that males who are victimized during adolescence will suffer damage to
their standing in the social hierarchy and therefore find themselves selected less often by
females for mating opportunities (Buss, 1988). If indirect victimization delays the onset of
sexual relations and reduces the victim's desirability to the opposite sex, it becomes an
effective evolutionary strategy for the aggressor (Buss and Dedden, 1990; Gallup et al.,
2009; Leenaars et al., 2008).
Hypothesis 3. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict higher than average
sex partners and earlier than average ages at first intercourse in females.
Gallup et al. (2009) demonstrated that female victims in their sample entered into
sexual relationships earlier and had higher than average numbers of sex partners than less
Indirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior

victimized peers. This hypothesis appears counter-intuitive because it suggests that having
more reproductive opportunities is detrimental to reproductive fitness. However,
reputational damage can occur when females are perceived by males to be promiscuous
which ultimately leads to reduced opportunities for long-term, high quality male mates.
Owens, Shute, and Slee (2000) have shown that girls denigrate victims with terms such as
"slut" or "whore" and focus negative attention on physical appearance and dress. These
aggressive acts aim directly at the sources of male attraction; fidelity and physical
attractiveness (Buss, 1989). Leenaar's et al. (2008) demonstrated that attractive girls report
high levels of indirect victimization suggesting that female aggressors target rivals who are
the most attractive potential mates.
It is important to note that early experience with sexual behavior may also provide
victims with some evolutionary benefits by expanding the length of time that they may
reproduce. However, these benefits need to be weighed in terms of the quality of mates
and future resource allocations provided by what may be inferior or uncommitted male
partners.
Somewhat more straightforward is the alternate hypothesis which suggests that
females victimized in adolescence are also marginalized from the mating pool, and thus
will have likely experienced a later onset of sexual activity and will have had fewer sexual
partners in early adulthood. Since victimization in adolescence does not preclude
perpetrating aggressive behavior as well, it is important to determine the effects of
victimization while controlling for aggression.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from introductory level psychology classes at the
University at Albany. Students received class credit for their participation. The University
Institutional Review Board approved this research and all participants signed informed
consent agreements. Participants included 82 heterosexual males and 61 heterosexual
females ranging in age from 18 to 28 years. Mean age was 18.85 years (SD =1.68) for
males and 19.11 years (SD =1.89) for females.
In preparation for statistical analyses, we eliminated outlying data points that
exceeded three standard deviations below the mean for age at first sex and three standard
deviations above the mean for number of sex partners. We also included only sexually
experienced participants. Statistical analyses were ultimately conducted on 68 male and 51
female participants.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mean ages at first
sexual intercourse for U.S. men and women aged 15-44 in 2002 were 17.0 years and 17.4
years respectively (Mosher, Chandra, and Jones, 2005). The participants retained in this
study reported a mean age at first intercourse of M = 16.13, SD = 1.61 for males and M =
16.75, SD = 1.45 for females. The median number of opposite-sex lifetime sexual partners
for Americans 20-24 years of age in 2002 was 3.8 for men and 2.8 for women. Our sample
of young adults slightly exceeds this national average with males M = 4.22, SD = 3.80 and
females M = 3.41, SD = 3.14, however we only included sexual experienced individuals.

Survey
Participants were asked to fill out an anonymous social experiences survey that
included questions about how often they demeaned-diminished-embarrassed, teased,
excluded, or isolated peers in middle school and high school and how often they were the
victim of these behaviors during the same period. Although there is some debate about
what these behaviors should be called, we recognize all of these behaviors as non-physical
means of manipulating the social environment either through peers or other
social/relational means (Björkquist, 2001; Björkqvist, Lagerspetz, Kaukainen, 1992;
Vaillancourt, 2005). Middle school was defined in the survey as grades six through eight
and high school as grades nine through twelve. Survey questions were modified from
Newman, Holden, and Delville (2005) and used previously in Gallup, White, and Gallup
(2007) and Gallup et al. (2009). Participants were also asked if they had engaged in sexual
intercourse, their age at first sexual intercourse, and their number of sexual partners.
In order to better understand the level of sexual experience in our sample we
calculated a ratio of partners per year of sexual activity by dividing the mean number of
sexual partners by the years of sexual activity. This variable captures rate of sexual
activity, and thus provides a measure of relative promiscuity. The number of years of
sexual activity was calculated by subtracting from the participant's age their age at first
sexual intercourse.
Indices were created using the variables above for high school and middle school
indirect aggression and indirect victimization by adding the score for each of the four
Likert scale responses (i.e. demeaned-diminished-embarrassed, teased, excluded, or
isolated). The minimum score is four and the maximum score is 20. Pearson correlation
coefficients were calculated to probe the relationship between aggression, victimization,
and the measures of reproductive behavior.
We also performed a principal components analysis (PCA) on the individual
aggression and victimization variables because the aggression and victimization index
results were significantly correlated. We chose to perform a PCA to produce uncorrelated
factors to use as independent variables. Sixteen questions in total were utilized in the PCA.
Males and female PCA were performed separately based on theoretical evidence
suggesting that males and females have different sexual strategies and styles of aggressive
behaviors (Björkqvist, 1994; Buss, 1989; Trivers, 1972). Correlation matrices for the full
male and female sample can be supplied by the first author. Statistical analysis was
conducted with R (R Development Core Team, 2008). R is a high level, freely available
statistical programming language and environment (Crawley, 2007).

Independent t-tests confirm that there were no statistically significant differences between
the means of males and females for number of sex partners (t = -1.364, df = 115.999, p =
0.175), age at first intercourse (t = 1.844, df = 105.927, p = 0.067) or partners/year (t = -

Table 2 lists the descriptive statistics for the indirect aggression and victimization
subscales by sex and age group (high school and middle school). We added an aggression
and victimization question on teasing after data collection began, therefore some
individuals did not respond to that question. This is reflected in the N below.

Statistical Results
Table 3 presents the correlation matrix for the four survey index questions and
reproductive behavior variables. The correlation matrix indicates that several indirect
aggression and indirect victimization variables are intercorrelated. Interestingly, in the
female sample high school aggression is significantly correlated with high school
victimization, middle school aggression and middle school victimization. In males, high
school aggression is correlated with high school victimization, and middle school

Mean values for aggression and victimization variables did not differ statistically by
sex (Hotelling's T2 for aggression variables T2 = 7.032 (8,92) p = 0.590, Hotelling's T2 for
victimization variables T2 = 9.202 (8,109) p =.382). Therefore we cannot conclude that one
sex is more indirectly aggressive or victimized than the other in this sample.
Principal components analysis results
Table 4 lists the standard deviations and variances explained by the first two
principal components as well as the loadings of each of the 16 variables on the first two
principal components for both male and female participants. The first principal component
explains the overall level of involvement in peer aggression as either a victim or an
aggressor (Table 3). Forty-eight percent of male participants and 39% of female
participants loaded negatively on PC1 which represents greater involvement in aggression,
victimization or both. This rate of involvement is higher than the 29.9% rate reported for
U.S. school children by Nansel, Overpeck, Pilla, Ruan, Simons-Morton, and Scheidt (2001)
in their analysis of the World Health Organization Health Behavior and School-aged
Children survey. However, this rate did not exceed the maximum level reported in the
international study (Nansel et al., 2004) and is based on only non-virgins.
The second principal component explains the level of aggression and victimization
reported by participants on a continuum from most victimized to most aggressive. The
factor loadings of the first and second principal components are listed in Table 4. Table 4

shows that both male and female indirect aggression loaded positively on PC2 while being
victimized loaded negatively on PC2. Figure 1A and 1B show male and female
participants plotted on PC1 and PC2. The figures also demonstrate the relationship
between age at onset of sexual intercourse and the first two principal components. We note
that 82% of the females in the top left quadrant in Figure 1B had sex at or earlier than age
16 years. This quadrant represents active indirect aggression towards peers. The mean age
at first sex in the active aggression quadrant (M = 16.318, SD = 1.46) is the lowest of all
four quadrants, however a one-way ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant
differences between the quadrant means F(3, 47) = .231, p = .874.
As expected, Figure 1 shows that the variance along PC2 is reduced for the portion
of the sample that loads positively on PC1 (i.e., overall lack of involvement in indirect
aggression). That is, the sample of individuals who were actively involved in peer
aggression or victimization varies widely in the frequency of perpetrating or experiencing
the behaviors in our survey (e.g., teasing).
The factor loadings on PC2 indicate that there is an expected developmental
decrease in the importance of indirect aggression and victimization in females from middle
school to high school. The factors that load most highly in females are middle school
excluding, isolating and teasing on the aggression side and being demeaned, teased and

excluded in middle school on the victimization side. In males there was an unexpected
reversal of the high school and middle school aggression variables indicating that high
school demeaning, teasing and excluding were the most influential variables. This may be
a product of the salience of mating related indirect aggression in older males. That is, older
Indirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior

males are more likely to be competing for mating opportunities and using indirectly
aggressive tactics. The male victimization results show that middle school isolation,
exclusion and teasing were the most influential variables.
Results indicate that 93% of male participants who reported being indirectly
victimized by peers in high school or middle school were victimized by other boys.
Similarly, females reported being victimized by other girls 72% of the time. Participants
who were indirectly aggressive toward their peers indicated that the target of their
aggression was most often same-sex peers (males = 97%, females = 84%). These data
support the hypothesis that peer aggression is a form of intrasexual competition (Pellegrini,
2007; Pellegrini and Archer, 2005).
Hypothesis 1: Age at first intercourse and indirect aggression in females.
In order to test Hypothesis 1, we performed a multiple regression analysis on age at
first sexual intercourse (dependent variable), and the first two principal components
(independent variables) which are uncorrelated representations of the 16 aggression and
victimization variables. The results of the multiple regression analysis are depicted in
Table 5. The multiple R2 of the model indicates that approximately 17% of the variance in
age at first sexual intercourse in females can be explained by PC1 and PC2. The model can
be simplified even further to include age at first sexual intercourse and PC2 as depicted in
Figure 2. The Pearson correlation coefficient between age at first sexual intercourse and
PC2 is r = -.395, p = .013 thus explaining 15.6% of the variance in the age at onset of
sexual intercourse. In other words, the more indirect aggression a girl perpetrates the
earlier she is likely to begin having sex. On the other hand, the more indirect victimization
girls experience (particularly in middle school) the older the girl is predicted to be at first
sexual intercourse. Hypothesis 1 is therefore supported by these data.

Hypothesis 2. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict fewer than average
sex partners and later than average ages at first intercourse in males.
For males, PC1 and PC2 did not predict the onset of sexual relations. The
correlation between PC2 and age at first sexual intercourse was r = -.130, p = .315. The
negative slope indicates that male perpetrators of indirect aggression have slightly earlier
ages at first sexual intercourse and victims of indirect aggression have later ages at first
sexual intercourse but the relationship is not statistically significant. Similarly, the

relationship between number of sex partners and PC2 and partners per year and PC2 are in
the predicted direction but the relationships are not statistically significant (number of sex
partners, r = .210, p = .101; partners per year, r = .178, p = .166).
Figure 2. Scatter plot and regression line of female PC2 and age at first sexual intercourse.
Hypothesis 3. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict higher than average
sex partners and earlier than average ages at first intercourse in females.
For females, the correlation between number of sex partners and PC2 is r =.220, p =
.178 and partners per year and PC2 is r = -.033, p = .844. The slope of the line for sex
partners and PC2 is not in the predicted direction suggested by Gallup et al. (2009) but
larger sample sizes are needed to explore these relationships further.
These results suggest a weak relationship between male and female reproductive
opportunities and indirect aggression/victimization but Hypotheses 2 and 3 are not
supported statistically.
Discussion
In this study, we collected retrospective data on the level of aggression and
victimization experienced by young adults to see how well these data predict reproductive
opportunity and how well they support an adaptive role for indirect aggression. The study
participants were mainly young adults beginning their most fecund period. Completed
fertility is unknown in this group and we estimated reproductive opportunity through

measures of sexual behavior such as number of sex partners and age at first sexual
intercourse. The study design is limited by the participant's ability to remember past
events and their truthfulness in responding to questions, however, the majority of
participants were only between one and ten years removed from the adolescent events we
investigated. One further limitation is that we did not collect information about marital
status and long-term relationship status. These questions will be added to future research
projects.
This study's major finding is the significant relationship between age at first sexual
intercourse and PC2 which represents a continuum from indirect aggression to indirect
victimization in females. We show that indirect aggression is associated with earlier ages
at first sexual intercourse, and thus victimization is associated with later ages at first sexual
intercourse. In a natural fertility population, age at first sexual intercourse is a proximate
determinant of total fertility and provides an important evolutionary advantage to females
who compete successfully for mating opportunities (Wood, 1994). In the absence of
contraceptive techniques, there appears to be adaptive value for indirect aggression in
females during adolescence. In a population that uses contraception like the one we
studied, indirect aggression and the resultant social manipulation of peers may help to train
adolescent girls to compete successfully for high quality long-term mates. Future work will
need to differentiate between competition for long-term and short-term mating
opportunities and how these strategies relate to indirect aggression. We will also need to
differentiate between high and low quality mates.
The adaptive advantage of indirect aggression may work through proximate
mechanisms such as increased social dominance, attacks on self-esteem, and resource
control which ultimately influence reproductive opportunities and outcomes in both males
and females (Hawley, 2007). Indirect intrasexual competition through social manipulation
by excluding, teasing, demeaning and isolating appears to activate phylogenetically ancient
pain mechanisms in the brain (Eisenberger and Lieberman, 2004). If the pain of social
exclusion is neurologically linked to the sensation of physical pain, one can easily see why
indirect aggression is such a powerful and ubiquitous technique to manipulate the social
environment (Masten, Eisenberger, Borofsky, Pfeifer, McNealy, Mazziotta, Dapretto,
2009).
We found that teasing and excluding were consistently among the top three loading
scores on both aggression perpetrated and victimization experienced in male and female
participants. Victims of adolescent aggression have been found to suffer anxiety,
depression, psychosocial dysfunction and psychosomatic illness (Rigby, 2002), the effects
of which may ultimately lead to lifelong reproductive disadvantage (Brown and Taylor,
2008; Fosse and Holen, 2004; Varhama and Björkqvist, 2005;). On the other hand, socially
aggressive adolescents are often popular, sought after by peers, and rank high in social
status (Hawley, 2007). Interestingly, these adolescents need not be well-liked to achieve
these important social gains (Cillessen and Mayeux, 2007).
Unlike physical aggression, indirect aggression appears to increase from early to
late adolescence as social intelligence increases and overt strategies are replaced by covert
strategies (Archer and Côté, 2005; Björkqvist et al., 1992; Pellegrini and Long, 2003;
Vaillancourt, Brendgen, Boivin, Tremblay, 2003). Our results indicate that although
indirect aggression may increase into late adolescence, middle school demeaning, teasing

and excluding has a particularly negative impact on victims as evidenced by the
relationship between age at first sexual intercourse and victimization. On the other hand,
excluding, isolating, and teasing others during middle school is associated with earlier
onset of sexual intercourse. Although girls may improve their competitive techniques as
they grow older, the earlier that these skills are in place the more potential reproductive
benefits they may reap. Therefore, the timing of aggression is of critical importance if it is
to have an influence on age at first sexual intercourse. In light of research that has linked
early sexual experiences with negative health outcomes such as sexually transmitted
diseases and teen pregnancy, this work suggests that indirect aggression early in
adolescence, if not a trigger, is a clue to early involvement in sexual activity in
heterosexuals (Coker, Richter, Valois, McKeown, Garrison, Vincent, 1994).
Although the results of this work are in general agreement with those of Gallup et
al. (2009) for males, we were not able to replicate their results for female victimization.
Gallup et al. (2009) showed that the lifetime number of sex partners and rate of partners per
year reported by females correlated positively with a middle school victimization index,
however, their study did not include measures of active peer aggression. The correlation
matrix in Table 3 indicates that aggressive behavior is significantly correlated with the
measures of victimization collected. That is, females in the current sample often reported
both victimization and aggression towards peers. In fact, Leenaar's et al. (2008)
demonstrated that aggression and indirect victimization are significantly correlated (r = .28,
p < .001) although this correlation was calculated with combined male and female results
(see their Table 1). The PCA allowed us to analyze both victimization and aggression
along a continuum which resulted in a strong negative correlation between PC2 and age at
first sexual intercourse. These results support previous work showing that indirect
aggression perpetrated and victimization experienced are not mutually exclusive and should
be considered together (Hawley, 1999).
These results prompt the following questions about the relationship between (1)
attractiveness and indirect victimization and (2) promiscuity and victimization. (1) Are
attractive females who report high levels of indirect victimization also perpetrators of high
levels of indirect aggression? (2) Are promiscuous victims with earlier than average ages
at first sexual intercourse also promiscuous aggressors with early ages at first sex? We
cannot answer these questions directly with the current dataset, however our results reveal
the importance of dealing with the bully/victim phenomenon (Andreou, 2000; Juvonen,
Graham, and Shuster, 2003; Olweus, 1993) as well as understanding the level at which any
particular individual participates in the social milieu. As an example of this issue, we note
that the correlation between age at first sexual intercourse and PC2 for the 16 females who
scored below 0 on PC1 (i.e. active participation in victimization or aggression) is r = -.559,
p = .024 in comparison to r = -.395 including the less active participants. It is therefore
possible that attractive victims are also attractive aggressors (Leenaar's et al., 2008) and
promiscuous victims are also promiscuous aggressors (Gallup et al., 2009).
Conclusion
Evolutionary theory is a particularly fruitful meta-theoretical framework from
which to generate testable explanations for aggressive behavior in adolescence (Hawley,
2007; Pellegrini, 2007). Competition for limited environmental resources, including mates,
Indirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior

provides a powerful explanation for what are seemingly antisocial and "maladaptive,"
although ubiquitous, behaviors among adolescents (Pellegrini, 2007, Sutton et al., 1999).
This research demonstrates that indirect aggression towards peers by females may have
long lasting positive reproductive benefits in adulthood. Future work will need to include
measures of both victimization and aggression as well as measures of long-term and short-
term mating strategies to better understand indirect aggression as a tool for intrasexual
competition.
This work demonstrates that adolescents who are actively involved in aggressive
interactions with peers are most likely to be involved in sexual behaviors earlier than those
who avoid these negative interactions.
