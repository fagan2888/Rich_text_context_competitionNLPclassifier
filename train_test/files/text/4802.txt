from sciences Po me
´dialab's experience

Abstract
In this article, we present a few lessons we learnt in the establishment of the Sciences Po me
´dialab. As an interdisciplinary
laboratory associating social scientists, code developers and information designers, the me
´dialab is not one of a kind.
In the last years, several of such initiatives have been established around the world to harness the potential of digital
technologies for the study of collective life. If we narrate this particular story, it is because, having lived it from the inside,
we can provide an intimate account of the surprises and displacements of digital research. Founding the me
´dialab in 2009,
we knew that we were leaving the reassuring traditions of social sciences to venture in the unexplored territory of digital
inscriptions. What we couldn't foresee was how much such encounter would change our research. Buying into gospel of
Big Data, we imagined that the main novelty of digital research came from handling larger amounts of data. We soon
realized that the interest of digital inscriptions comes instead from their proliferating diversity. Such diversity encouraged
us to reshape our professional alliances, research practices and theoretical perspectives. It also led us to overcome
several of the oppositions that used to characterize social sciences (qualitative/quantitative, situation/aggregation, micro/
macro, local/global) and to move in the direction of a more continuous sociology.

A peek in our logbook
In the last couple of decades, the advent of digital
media has created much ferment in the social sciences.
The availability of a new source of information on col-
lective phenomena has encouraged a growing number
of academic institutions to create interdisciplinary
initiatives at the crossroad of media studies, computa-
tional sciences and information design. Among these
we can mention (citing only the groups with which
we had direct contact): the Digital Methods Initiative
of the University of Amsterdam (digitalmethods.net);
the Institutes for Complex Systems of Rho
^ ne-Alpes
(ixxi.fr) and Ile de France (iscpif.fr); the Institut
Francilien Recherche Innovation Socie´te´ (ifris.org); the
Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies of the
University of Warwick (warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/
cim/); the Density Design Lab of the Politecnico if
Milano (densitydesign.org); the Laborato´rio de estudos
sobre Imagem e Cibercultura of the University of the
University of Espi´rito Santo (labic.net); the Medialab
of the University of Rio de Janeiro (medialabufrj.
net); the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online
Networks of the Australian National University
(vosonlab.net); the Social Science Matrix of the
University of Berkeley. This list if far from exhaustive
(a search in this very journal will easily return dozens of
other groups), yet it gives an idea of how diffused and

diverse is this movement. The me
´ dialab of Sciences Po
is only one of these initiatives. In this article, we will
focus on its story not because it is unique, but because it
will help us to narrate the peculiar way in which the
encounter with `the digital' has affected our research.
The tone of our text will be rather intimate. We are
less interested here in proposing concepts or techniques
that in conveying the peculiar atmosphere that charac-
terizes these early years of digital methods (see Latour
et al., 2012, for a more theoretical outlook). Richard
Rogers, one of the protagonist of this movement,
argued that digital methods are about `re-purposing'
new media for social investigation (Rogers, 2013).
While this is true, it is also interesting to appreciate
how digital techniques have repurposed social research
in return. This article narrates the story of this repur-
posing and leads the reader through the encounters
that, in the first years of the me
´ dialab, changed our
way of doing social research. Through its three sec-
tions, the article discusses how the digital transformed
our relation to the data, the methods and the theory of
social research.
While none of these transformations is entirely new,
the way in which the me
´ dialab weaved them in a coher-
ent narrative is, we believe, original. The fil rouge (the
guiding thread) of this narrative is the way in which
digital technologies displace and eventually dissolve
the classic distinctions of our discipline: qualitative/
quantitative in data, situation/aggregation in methods
and micro/macro in theory. Encounter after encounter,
our unexpected journey brought us beyond such dis-
tinctions, toward a more `continuous sociology'.
A last note on style: in this article, we make an abun-
dant use of metaphors and not by chance. The trans-
formations that digital methods are encouraging are
deep but still unaccomplished. Different approaches
still co-exist and their outcomes can be varied. This
openness is one of the things that we like the most
about our field and we do not want to close it too
soon or too much. Metaphors will allow us to provide
a sense of where digital research is heading while leav-
ing open the range of possible explorations.
Three displacements of digital traces
(continuity in data)
When the Sciences Po me
´ dialab left the harbor in May
2009, we all had in mind stories of the miraculous
draught of digital data. Having heard our fair share
of Big Data tales, we cast our nets in the digital sea
and waited for the miracle. Withdrawing our nets, how-
ever, we found them full to the brim, but not of data.
What we got was instead a catch of digital traces, dif-
ferent from the Big Data in at least three respects. (1)
The main novelty of digital technologies is their
increased traceability, (2) which does not zero the cost
of social data, (3) but augment their diversity. We will
describe these three displacements as we experienced
them at the me
´ dialab, but others scholars have pro-
vided similar accounts (see, for example, Bollier and
Firestone, 2010; Boyd and Crawford, 2011; Marres,
2012; Uprichard, 2013).
(1) By `digital traces', we intend loosely all the
inscriptions produced by digital devices in their medi-
ation of collective actions ­ for instance, a post pub-
lished on a blog, a hyperlink connecting two websites or
the log of an e-commerce transaction. Though the
terms `inscriptions', `traces' and `data' are often used
as synonyms, it is here important to distinguish their
different meanings.
`Inscription' is the more general terms and it refers to
any piece of information that is materialized through a
technical device (digital or not). Inscriptions are the
foundation of any scientific enterprise for they allow
to imprint knowledge on material supports, which can
be stored, transformed and transmitted (Latour, 1983,
1990, 1979; Latour and Woolgar, 1979). For most nat-
ural and social researches, inscriptions are produced by
devices specifically set up for this intent. Sometime,
however, inscriptions are produced by other purposes
and become object of scientific enquiry only later. This
is distinctively the case for digital research, which is
often performed as a form of secondary analysis of
inscriptions produced for marketing, surveillance or
technical purposes (cf. Ruppert et al., 2013).
The practice of using second-hand inscriptions for
social investigation does not start with digital media.
Since the invention of writing and increasingly with
the introduction of the alphabet, the printing press,
the broadcast media and the communication technolo-
gies in general, our collective life is organized through a
web of material inscriptions. And, since their founda-
tion, social sciences have exploited such inscriptions for
their research. In this sense, there is nothing new about
digital media (Boullier, 2015), except for the amplifica-
tion that they impose to such process (in line with
McLuhan, 1964, hypothesis of media acceleration).
As social sciences are concerned, the main novelty of
digital media is to have assembled an unprecedentedly
extensive ensemble of inscribing infrastructure (Bowker
et al., 2009).
Such crucial novelty was initially overlooked by
social sciences. Opposing `the virtual' to `the material',
early media scholars regarded to electronic networks as
a new terrain for old methods. Notions such as `cyber-
culture' (Negroponte, 1995), `virtual communities'
(Rheingold, 1993), `online identities' (Turkle, 1995)
were introduced to channel the novelty of new media
within the tradition of social sciences (Rogers,
2009).[1995, 1993] Such approach, however, concealed
2 Big Data & Society
the most interesting feature of electronic media: the
fact that, far from making social relations more vir-
tual, they multiply their material inscriptions. Passing
through routers, cables, databases, our associations
leave traces that can be easily recorded, massively con-
served and instantly retrieved:
Once you can get information as bores, bytes, modem,
sockets, cables and so on, you have actually a more
material way of looking at what happens in Society.
Virtual Society thus, is not a thing of the future, it's
the materialisation, the traceability of Society. It ren-
ders visible because of the obsessive necessity of mate-
rialising information into cables. (Latour, 1998)
(2) As digital media increase the traceability of collect-
ive phenomena, our initial Big Data enthusiasm seemed
justified. As we soon realized, however, the prolifer-
ation of digital inscriptions is not per se a gain for the
social sciences. Here is where we need to distinguish
between `digital traces' and `digital data'. With the
term traces, we refer to inscriptions as originally pro-
duced by digital devices (e.g., a hyperlink as stored in a
HTML code of a web page). With the term data, we
refer to the same inscriptions having undergone the
cleaning and refining necessary to make them useful
knowledge objects (e.g., our hyperlink as translated in
an edge of a website network).
While such distinction is somewhat artificial (there
are no such things as `raw traces' and all inscription
processes entail adjustments and correction), it has
the advantage of drawing attention to the multiple
transformations that inscriptions must undergo before
they can be exploited (see Bachelard, 1949, on `evidence
work' and Cardon, 2013, on `digital evidence work').
In the case of digital methods, much of this process
happens outside the academia, with bias that digital
researchers are forced to inherit. The problem with digi-
tal data is not that they are biased (all data is). It is that
the control that social scientists can exert on their bias
is remarkably poor (Savage and Burrows, 2007).
Digital data is still at an early stage in the process of
sociological validation and should therefore be used
with caution and never without investigating the con-
ditions of their fabrication (Marres and Gerlitz, 2016).
To be exploited in research, digital data needs to be
detached from their original contexts and refitted for
research. Such `repurposing' work (Rogers, 2013)
requires significant efforts and specific expertise. This
is why the Sciences Po me
´ dialab could not exist without
its data experts. Digital media are undoubtedly a fertile
ground, but they yield nothing if they are not skillfully
labored. Engineers, computer scientists, developers,
data geeks know how to nurture this kind of data in
ways that social scientists still have to learn. Also,
being more familiar with digital technologies, they are
also more resistant to technological hype. Being
acquainted to the hardships of `data friction'
(Edwards, 2010), they know that only a little fraction
of digital inscriptions will transmute into usable data
and only through a good deal of their work.
(3) Left as adventurers of the digital El Dorado, we
settled as data farmers. We learned that information
infrastructures pay the costs of the inscription of digital
traces, but not those of their transformation into socio-
logical data. `More traces', therefore, does not mean
`more data', but more sources from which data can
be extracted. At the beginning of our adventure, we
neglected such crucial distinction and paid the conse-
quences in our choice of sources. Like kids in a toy
store, we went for the biggest. We coveted the huge
reservoirs of Web 2.0 platforms, and forgot that the
largest sources are not always the most valuable.
Platforms such as Google, Facebook or Wikipedia do
produce large quantities of traces (and do re-distribute
some of them). Yet, such abundance of traces does not
always convert into valuable data (Lazer et al., 2014)
and mainstream social media are not always the most
interesting sources. Google is ideal for studying the flow
of online attention (Choi and Varian, 2009); Facebook
is a decent proxy of Web sociability (Rieder, 2013);
Wikipedia is great for studying knowledge debates
(Borra et al., 2014; Niederer and Dijck, 2010). Still,
none of them can answer all the questions of the
social sciences. Nor should they: there are more things
in Internet and the Web (Horatio) than are indexed in
your social media! Seen from the outside, the jungle of
digital inscription meets the eye for its extension. But
from the inside, its most amazing feature is the stunning
diversity of the species that it shelters.
An example comes from a research that the me
´ dialab
carried out on the international negotiations on climate
change. In two projects dedicated to the climate debate
(www.emapsproject.com and projetmedea.hypothese-
s.org), we were looking for information on the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). Conventional data on such negotiations
are available through the reports of ethnographers
and through the UNFCCC documents archive
(unfccc.int). Such data allows investigating respectively
the detail of diplomatic practices and the overall struc-
ture of the climate regime, but not the connection
between the two. Moving in controversy analysis trad-
ition (Pestre, 2007; Pinch, 2015; Venturini, 2010, 2012),
we wanted to follow the rise and fall of issues; the
forming of alliances and oppositions; and the position-
ing of delegations on items of the climate agenda.
We wanted to observe the dynamics of the `diplomatic
ballet' and the complex arrangements produced by such
dynamics.
Venturini et al. 3
To follow these discursive actions, we first thought
of exploiting Twitter and investigate climate talks
through the messages exchanged by negotiators and
policy-makers. Despite the existence of a remarkable
project by UN Climate Change Secretariat (climate-
talkslive.org), we found Twitter traces disappointing.
Such traces were indeed massive (with thousands of
messages exchanged every day), but they shed little
light on the negotiations. Tweets are just too short to
convey the subtleties of climate diplomacy and are gen-
erally addressed to the public more than to other nego-
tiators. They allowed us to extract the general agendas
pushed by different countries (and their reception by
the media), but not to follow the negotiation dynamics.
So, we looked further and came across the Earth
Negotiation Bulletin (www.iisd.ca/vol12), compiled by
the International Institute for Sustainable Development
(IISD). The ENB reports on all UN negotiations cover-
ing both the official proceedings and the discussions in
the corridors. The ENB can hardly be called Big Data.
Its traces are neither big (the volume dedicated to
climate negotiations contains about 600 issues of a
few pages each) nor `natively digital' (the reports are
first distributed in paper to the negotiators and then
archived on the IISD website). The ENB inscriptions
are not as rich as ethnographic observations (the
reports iron out all nuances to propose a dry para-
phrasing of the arguments exchanged) and not as exten-
sive as the UNFCCC archive (the reports cover the
positions taken in the meetings, but disregard the
materials submitted by parties or produced by bodies
of the Convention). Yet, the ENB traces have enough
breadth to follow climate debate throughout the two
decades of the UNFCCC negotiations and enough
depth to identify single diplomatic moves (cf.
Venturini et al., 2014a, and climatenegotiations.org).
Of course, this comes at a price. The ENB reports
are not written for scholars, but for negotiators. Each
issue summarizes one day of negotiations, compiling in
one document different tracks and formats that
researchers might want to separate (e.g., IPCC debates
cannot be studied in the same way as UNFCCC's; dis-
cussions in the corridors demand a different treatment
than talks in the plenaries). Also, the ENB reports
include `duplicates' in the form of summaries of the
`previous episodes' and analyses of the negotiations.
Exploiting the ENB traces demanded therefore an
extensive work of cleaning and refining that ended up
occupying most of our project time.
The ENB corpus thus illustrates the three displace-
ments characteristic of digital traces: (1) it is not larger
or more detailed than traditional datasets; (2) it
demands a thorough refinement before it can be used
for research; (3) but it allows investigating climate
negotiations in breadth and depth. This third
displacement is, we believe, the most important. As
we said, digital data is not necessary more abundant
than their predecessors and they are certainly not clea-
ner or cheaper. They are, however, more diverse and
more evenly distributed across the span of collective
existence of which they therefore offer a more continu-
ous appraisal.
Datascape navigation
(continuity in methods)
The diversity of digital traces holds great potential, but
it also demands to rethink our methods and, in particu-
lar, the classic opposition between qualitative and
quantitative approaches. In our sociological training,
we learned that knowledge can be obtained by two
opposite strategies: either by focusing on particular
events and collecting as much information as possible;
or by selecting specific bits of information and harvest-
ing them through time and space. Through qualitative
methods, we learned to examine local interactions.
Through quantitative methods, we learned to skim
over global trends. Both strategies are undeniably pro-
ductive in their sphere and most scholars are capable to
alternate and mix them. Yet, the discontinuity between
the two types of methods generated a blind spot in our
vision. We can glance at the global picture and examine
each piece of interaction, but we cannot observe how
the puzzle of collective life is put together.
The arrival of digital traceability may bridge such
discontinuity by generating information on an increas-
ing variety of phenomena and, most importantly, at a
variety of scales. By their proliferating diversity, digital
traces diffract so much the perspectives of social
research and dissolve traditional oppositions (Latour
et al., 2012). In this sense, our approach may be
called `quali-quantitative' (Venturini et al., 2015a),
but the label is inappropriate as digital methods do
not lie between qualitative and quantitative methods.
Nor do they get the best of both worlds: the quantity
of digital data is not always larger than traditional
statistics and their quality is often inferior to ethno-
graphic observations. Yet, the more the digital media
infiltrate collective life, the more varied become the
traces that social scientists can exploit. The following
figure tries to render this idea. It is far too simplistic,
but has one quality: instead of representing the classic
quali/quantitative continuum, it outlines a space in
which inscriptions distribute unevenly but not binarily
(Figure 1).
Looking at the figure below, readers will remark that
data (i.e., inscriptions refined to serve as basis for
research) tend to be more polarized than inscriptions
and have a more skewed coverage of the social space.
Not only traditional methods start from different types
4 Big Data & Society
of inscriptions, but they also refine them in opposite
directions. Most traditional research protocols are uni-
directional: they have been sharpened to produce more
situation or more aggregation. Situated observation
allows preserving the full richness of the situation, but
entails renouncing to follow the influences that associ-
ate `here and now' to other times and places.
Aggregation allows extending the scope of sociological
vision, but demands focusing on specific observables
(e.g., not persons in their full complexity, but say
their age or income) and concentrating on regularities
rather than exceptions.
Part of the discontinuity between situation and
aggregation derives from the difficulty of rewinding
such procedures and to reverse the transformations
that they operate. To be sure, good researchers have
always provided their readers the means to reverse
their protocols (Latour, 1995). Yet, before digitaliza-
tion, the variety of research devices (notepads, audio
and video recorders, questionnaires, data tables, type-
written reports, calculators, printed texts, etc.) made
reversing objectively difficult. Disaggregating a statis-
tical chart entailed, for instance, moving from the
chart to the calculator, from the calculator to the
data table, from the table to the research notebook,
from the notebook to the sample and from the
sample to the actual phenomenon. With the advent of
digital technologies, an increasing number of research
transformations take place in the same personal com-
puters. This does not mean, of course, that such trans-
formations have got any easier. It means, however, that
they can be made reversible with reasonable effort.
Unfortunately, this opportunity is not always
exploited and too often the technical expertise required
by digital methods becomes an extra obstacle to the
rewinding of research procedures. This is why, particu-
larly in digital research, findings should always be
accompanied by the data on which they are based,
the traces from which this data is extracted and the
scripts that allowed the extraction (cf. Ince et al.,
2012; Willinsky, 2006). To this purpose, Rieder and
Ro
¨ hle (2012) encourage digital researchers to comple-
ment their articles with a `companion web-site':
Such a website could further document methodological
choices, provide in-depth information on technical
aspects, and, if possible, source code. It could also, as
part of a data-sharing plan, provide access to the `raw'
data that went into the project, allowing other research-
ers to experiment with different approaches and arrive
at different results. Also, a companion website seems
like an ideal vehicle to present results more dynamically
and interactively. Instead of providing the research
results as a closed, finished product, Web-based inter-
faces could allow audiences to explore them both
inductively and deductively, involving them in the pro-
cess of knowledge production. (pp.80,81)
A more reversible digital publication not only
improves transparency and replicability, but transforms
the way we read, write and design research. A good
digital research does more than catering a series of
results to its readers, it provides them interfaces to navi-
gate through the inscriptions.
This was never clearer to us than in an investigation
that the me
´ dialab carried out on French parliamentary
system (but see another example of our work in
Leclercq, 2017). In such investigation, we were working
with political scientists to assess how much French laws
are substantially amended through parliamentary dis-
cussions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods
seemed unfit for the project. We could have dissected
the parliamentary journey of a few bills to examine
their transformation, but how to know if findings
could be generalized? And we could have devised
some statistical measures of parliamentary transform-
ation and compute them for all French laws, but how to
know whether those metrics were not too simplistic
(and capable to differentiate substantial from cosmetic
modifications)?
Eventually, we created an online platform to explore
the details some 300 laws proposals (www.lafabrique-
delaloi.fr). The platform allows comparing how long
different laws were discussed in different branch of
the parliament and how many words were changed
through such discussion (see Figure 2(a)); identifying
how much each article of each law has been modified
at each passage (see Figure 2(b)); considering all the
amendments proposed by different political groups
(see Figure 2(c)); and reading the transcription of
each word spoken by each parliament member on
each specific article at each stage of the discussion
(see Figure 2(d)).

circles), traditional data (clear black circle), digital traces (blurred
grey squares) and digital data (clear grey square).
Venturini et al. 5
The development of such platform marked the me
´ d-
ialab more than we expected (Venturini, 2017).
Building ways to move from the most aggregated over-
views to the debates' minutes (and back), we felt the
discontinuity of social sciences fading away. Not only
we encountered little opposition between the quality
and the quantity of our data (parliamentary logs offer
one and the other, provided that one is willing to invest
the efforts to mine and refine them), but we also rea-
lized that situation and aggregation could happily coex-
ist as functions of the same digital platform. Datascape
navigation (as call this experience) recognizes the
importance of both the examination of specificities
and the generalization of trends, but instead of looking
for a balance or compromise, it aims facilitating the
movement between the two. And this is where the jour-
ney of the me
´ dialab met another type of expertise:
besides social scientists and developers, our team
came to include designers.
Unlike quantitative methods, the purpose of our
research is not to deliver stable findings to its readers
and, unlike qualitative methods, it is not to immerse
them in specific situations. Its purpose is to offer its
readers (but `users' would be a more appropriate
term) interfaces to browse large datasets and identify
interesting data points. And this is where the help of
interface design and information design (Bertin, 1967;
Tufte, 1983) comes in handy. By multiplying the oper-
ations that users can perform on digital inscriptions,
datascape design dissolves the discontinuity between
situation and aggregation. Not only by finding ways
of reconciling these movements, but also by showing
they are only two among the many ways of navigating
through data. In this sense, quali-quantitative methods
are utterly different from `mixed methods' (Johnson
and Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Our objective is not to com-
bine qualitative and quantitative techniques, but to
overcome their opposition altogether, drawing on the
increased diversity of data to promote a greater diver-
sity of methods. We as are interested in alternating situ-
ation and aggregation, then in exploring other
navigational operations such as highlighting, sorting,
filtering, zooming, selecting, comparing, link surfing
and annotating (cf. Heer and Shneiderman, 2012;
Yi et al., 2007).
If all these operations existed before computers, their
digital instantiation has greatly increased the ease with
which they can be performed. In a sense, datascape
navigation materializes the dream of the Exploratory
Data Analysis (Behrens and Chong-Ho, 2003; Tukey,
1977) but also its nightmare ­ the risk that more explor-
ation possibilities might end up producing greater dis-
orientation. Over-complicated dashboards only add an
`interface overload' to the `information overload'
already experienced by digital researchers. This is why
the contribution of designers is crucial to carefully
select and combine different forms of navigation into
meaningful forms of data exploration.

Beyond micro and macro
(continuity in theory)
The dissolution of the quali/quantitative divide encour-
aged us to take one step further and rethink the theor-
etical opposition between individual actors and social
collectives, micro-interactions and macro-structures.
Central in social research at least from Durkheim
(1897, 1912), such binary conception was convenient
(even indispensable) when the separation between
qualitative and quantitative methods pulled research
in opposite directions. It provided a handy conceptual-
ization of the two types of phenomena that situation
and aggregation can best describe, respectively, local
and ephemeral exchanges and global and enduring
trends. However, as digital traceability and datascape
navigation makes data and methods more continuous,
the micro/macro distinction appears less significant.
The best proof that those two levels do not correspond
to any real ontological domains is that they begin
to disappear, to be literally redistributed, every time
one modifies or enhances the quality of access to the
datasets, thereby allowing the observer to define any
actor by its network and vice versa. This is exactly
what the striking extension of digital tools is doing
to the very notions of `individual' and `wholes'.
The experience (more and more common nowadays)
of navigating on a screen from elements to aggregates
may lead researchers to grant less importance to
those two provisional end points. Instead of having
to choose and thus to jump from individuals to
wholes, from micro to macro, you occupy all sorts of
other positions, constantly rearranging the way pro-
files are interconnected and overlapping. (Latour
et al., 2012: 595)
Digital research dissolves in practice a distinction
that we still struggle to overcome in theory.
Following the lead of its founder (Latour, 2005) and
the lesson of Actor-Network Theory (Law and
Hassard, 1999), the me
´ dialab has always tried to dis-
pense with local/global distinctions. But attacking the
micro/macro divide in theory, we were constantly
trapped in using the same concepts that we tried to
refuse (the very name `actor-network' is a perfect exam-
ple of such paradox). Talking of `quali-quantitative
methods', `navigating through situation and aggrega-
tion' and `overcoming the micro/macro divide', we
cannot avoid giving the wrong impression that the
adventure is located between and not beyond these trad-
itional oppositions. Much clearer than any theoretical
argument, the research practices embedded in our tools
and methods demonstrate what a continuous sociology
can deliver (tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr).
To understand the advantages of a continuous
research, consider a playful diagram designed by Andy
Greenwald (grantland.com/features/the-hbo-recycling-
program) to highlight how the HBO television network
`recycle' the same performers in different series (see
Figure 3(a)). Besides showing that most performers are
connected to several lines (hence the `recycling'), the dia-
gram does not convey much. In particular, it is difficult
observe which performers co-appear in the same series
and which series share the same performers. This infor-
mation is hidden by the separation between performers
and series. Since the performers are aligned on the left
of the diagram (the micro) and the series are aligned on
the right (the macro), all other groupings disappear. It is
enough, however, to remove this separation ­ and let
performers and series position themselves on the same
plan ­ to highlight other fractures and other groupings
(notably the `gangster' cluster at the bottom of the net-
work) (see Figure 3(b)).
At the me
´ dialab, we encountered the same experi-
ence in a more academic case (Venturini et al., 2016).
Using a network visualization (see Figure 4(b)),
we tried to overcome the separation between the indi-
viduals and the institutions of the French dominant
class, which a famous table by Luc Boltanski (1973)
separated in rows and columns (see Figure 4(a)).
Representing individuals and institutions on the same
plan we could highlight not only how many connec-
tions had each entity (as in the table), but also how
far in the social space did such connections extended.
Besides hiding other (often more relevant) fractures,
the micro/macro distinction has another disadvantage:
it conceals the work invested to build individual inter-
actions and collective aggregates, conceiving the former
given and the latter as `emerging'. Introduced in biol-
ogy, the notion of `emergence' has been developed to
express the idea that complex systems (e.g., living
organisms) have properties (e.g., the fact of being
alive) that are impossible to anticipate from their com-
ponents. An emergent phenomenon is `unlike its com-
ponents insofar as these are incommensurable, and it
cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference'
(Lewes, 1875: 412, cfr. the `Emergent Properties' entry
in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2012).
Transported in the social sciences, the notion of emer-
gence risks however to naturalize (and de-politicize) col-
lective systems. If institutions and norms are emergent,
then none can be held responsible for them. They derive
from the interactions among a multitude of actors, but
not correspond to the intentions of any of them. The
metaphor recurrently employed is that of ants' colonies.
Like ants reacting to the pheromones that they encounter,
but incapable to appreciate the larger architecture of their
nests (Garnier et al., 2007), social actors would create
global structures by reacting to their local environment.
Venturini et al. 7
Remarkably, this `emergent' approach characterized
the first applications of digital computation to social sci-
ences ­ particularly through agent-based models (see
Castellano et al., 2009, and the special issues of PNAS,
99-3 and American Journal of Sociology, 110-4).
Attributing global structures to mysterious emergent
dynamics (that, by definition, cannot be studied) made
sense when the opposition between qualitative and quan-
titativemethodsofferedlittleinformationonanythingelse
than situated interactions and aggregated trends. Yet, as
digital traceability allows investigating collective actions
at a plurality of levels, the opposition between `micromo-
tives and macrobehaviors' (Schelling, 1978) lose much of
its interest. Even worse, such binary approach has become
a tangible obstacle to understanding some of the collective
crises faced by our societies (Venturini et al., 2015b).
At the me
´ dialab, we stumbled on such an obstacle
while mapping the debate on climate change in
the EMAPS project (Venturini et al., 2014b, http://
climaps.eu). Such debate is blocked (among many other
reasons) because of the tendency to present
personalchoicesorworldwideagreementsastheonlypos-
sible dimensions to tackle the climate crisis (Aykut and
Dahan, 2015, callthis the `reality schisms' of international
climate regime). While both these levels are clearly
important, they are by no means the only ones.
Countless other collective actions are possible and neces-
sary at other scales, including industrial policies, con-
sumptions trends, ecological resiliencies, local
communities, etc. While all these scales have been studied
by social scientists, the discontinuity of our methods and
theories have made it difficult to observe the `scale-break-
ing' relations that connects, for example, the international
funding decisions to the adaptation projects carried out in
specific districts of Bangladesh (http://climaps.eu#!/nar-
rative/climate-adaptation-in-bangladesh); or the discus-
sions about natural and social resilience to the climate
investments in different regions of Germany (http://cli-
maps.eu#!/narrative/who-deserves-to-be-funded).
Inviting us to navigate through different scales of
actions, digital methods have profound political impli-
cations. Alongside the transformation of digital inscrip-
tions, another (more important) operation is taking
place: the crafting of alternative narratives about
social life. By dissolving the binary distinction between
qualitative and quantitative methods, situation and
aggregation, digital research makes space to a new set
of collective stories. Such stories involve a multitude of
actors other than individuals and structures ­ associ-
ations, communities, clusters, networks, interest
groups, concerned publics and a variety of other char-
acters. Though these characters have long been known

by social sciences, the `flatting' effect produced by the
continuity of digital methods suddenly bring them
together and force them to share the same stage.
Welcoming these actors and their interference is
both crucial and crucially difficult. As we tried to
convey in this article, there is nothing automatic
about digital methods. The variety of digital traces
comes with the responsibility to chose among different
sources. Say we want to work on climate adaptation
(as we did in EMAPS), where should we start from?
from the report of the OECD Official Aid Report; from
the UNDP database of adaptation projects; or from
tweets about global warming? And once the sources
chosen, we still have to decide how we will transform
their inscriptions; how we will analyse the resulting
data; and which forms of navigation we will encourage
with our interfaces. While we know that each of these
decisions will have a substantial influence on our
research outcomes, we often lack the knowledge neces-
sary to make them. Our methodological focus makes us
experts on digital techniques, not on the issues we study
through them. And this is where the dialogue with a
variety of social actors becomes crucial. Provided that
we find ways to organize the various (and sometime
conflicting) contributions coming from, e.g., a spokes-
person of the French Finance ministry, a development
specialist working on an adaptation project in Tuvalu,
or Bangladeshi negotiator at the UNFCCC.
Organizing the heterogeneity of these contributions
and redistributing research decisions demand once more
to renew our scientific practices. Different research for-
mats have been experimented at the me
´ dialab, like work-
shops, data sprints (Munk et al., 2016; Venturini et al.,
2016a), simulations and exhibitions. These different
types of events are meant to engage different types of
publics: workshops, for example, address fellow
researchers; data sprints address experts; simulations
address students; exhibitions address the general public.
Yet, all these formats represent `extreme' versions of the
way in which we do research on a daily basis: we work
collaboratively on data, we imagine uses and users for our
datascape and we show our tools to actors, experts and
(a)

communities. Crafting these interactions has become an
integral part of our approach to digital methods, a way of
doing research in which face to face interactions ended up
being every bit as important as digital computation.
The journey of the me
´ dialab is not finished and other
unexpected encounters await in the future of social sci-
ences. It is not too early, however, from taking stock of
what we have learned. By our trials and by our errors, we
experienced how different is the practice digital research
from the dream of Big Data. The digital is not a land of
abundance. It is not a place where information pour in
freely or easily; not a place where computational tricks,
powerful as they may be, can replace the hard work
necessary to mine, nurture and refine inscriptions.
Digital methods do not spare us from walking the
walk, but they give us the chance to experiment new
pathways. The diversity of digital traces and techniques
challenges disciplinary orthodoxies. It compels us to
consider new ways of collecting and redistributing infor-
mation; it pushes us out of our comfort zone; forces us to
ally with developers, designers and with a multiplicity of
social actors. None of this is easy, to be sure, and nothing
assures that the promise of digital methods will be kept.
Pursuing a more continuous sociology is not the same
thing as achieving the continuity of the social. Our jour-
ney is far from reaching its harbor, but `the sails are set,
the wind is east, the moorings fret'.
