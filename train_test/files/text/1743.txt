Abstract
Objective. Health outcome assessments have become an expectation of regulatory and accreditation agencies. We examined
whether a clinically credible risk adjustment methodology for the outcome of change in health status can be developed for per-
formance assessment of integrated service networks.
Study design. Longitudinal study.
Setting. Outpatient.
Study participants. Thirty-one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three patients from 22 Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) integrated service networks were followed for 18 months.
Main measures. The physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scales from the Veterans Rand 36-items Health Survey
(VR-36) and mortality. The outcomes were decline in PCS (decline in PCS scores greater than -6.5 points or death) and MCS
(decline in MCS scores greater than -7.9 points).
Results. Four thousand three hundred and twenty-eight (13.6%) patients showed a decline in PCS scores greater than -6.5
points, 4322 (13.5%) had a decline in MCS scores by more than -7.9 points, and 1737 died (5.5%). Multivariate logistic regres-
sion models were used to adjust for case-mix. The models performed reasonably well in cross-validated tests of discrimination
(c-statistics = 0.72 and 0.68 for decline in PCS and MCS, respectively) and calibration. The resulting risk-adjusted rates of
decline in PCS and MCS and ranks of the networks differed considerably from unadjusted ratings.
Conclusion. It is feasible to develop clinically credible risk adjustment models for the outcomes of decline in PCS and MCS.
Without adequate controls for case-mix, we could not determine whether poor patient outcomes reflect poor performance,
sicker patients, or other factors. This methodology can help to measure and report the performance of health care systems.

There is increasing emphasis on ambulatory care and a corre-
sponding need to evaluate its outcomes [1]. One particularly
useful outcome is health status, which can be determined by
patient self-report using well established and carefully validated
questionnaires such as the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form 36 (MOS SF-36) [2]. Studies have shown that the MOS
SF-36 is sensitive to changes in health in general populations
[3]. Ware et al. [4] have linked changes in MOS SF-36 scores to
the performance of systems of care. Efforts to infer quality
from such assessments may be misleading, however, if we do
not account for differences in patient's clinical characteristics,
or case-mix, that can also influence changes in health status.
Risk adjustment is a methodology to control for patient
characteristics that may affect health care outcomes. A variety

of measures are currently applied to adjust for risk across
ambulatory populations [5]. Although these applications rep-
resent significant advances in the measurement of case-mix,
they focus primarily on cost and care utilization. Studies have
shown that both the socioeconomic background and individ-
ual clinical status of patients influence performance measure-
ments [4,6]. However, methods for risk adjustment to predict
change in health status are yet to be tested.
In this article, we aimed to develop and validate a compre-
hensive approach for risk adjustment of change in health sta-
tus to assess the performance of integrated service networks
in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These net-
works are designed to provide coordinated and integrated
care with an emphasis on outpatient treatment. Given that
they vary in geography and patient characteristics, they offer a
unique opportunity to study case-mix adjustment for change
in health status. In this study, we specifically addressed three
research objectives: (i) to determine whether clinically credi-
ble and statistically reliable risk-adjusted models can be
developed, (ii) to examine whether case-mix differences exist
across integrated service networks, and (iii) to assess whether
risk adjustment alters judgements of network performance.
Methods
Study population
This study used data from the National Survey of Ambulatory
Care Patients [7]. Any veteran who received ambulatory care in
VHA integrated service networks between 1 January 1997 and
17 December 1997 was eligible to be sampled. A typical net-
work encompasses a geographic region with an average of 7­10
VA medical centers, 25­30 ambulatory care clinics, 4­7 nursing
homes, 1­2 domiciliaries, and 10­15 counseling centers [8].
Among 43,965 patients randomly recruited, 31,823 (72.3%)
patients completed a mailed survey in February 1998. Of those
patients, 1737 (5.5%) died during the 18 months follow-up and
21,378 (67.2%) responded to a mailed follow-up survey that
was administered 18 months after the baseline survey. We iden-
tified 8708 patients with missing follow-up information.
Outcome measures
We measured outcomes using the Veterans Rand 36-items
Health Survey (VR-36) [9], a reliable and valid measure of
health-related quality of life modified from the MOS SF-36
and mortality data. The SF-36 scales were summarized into
physical (PCS) and mental component (MCS) scales [10]. The
two summaries, PCS and MCS, were scored using a linear
t-score transformation that was normed to a general US
population. Mortality was determined using the VHA Benefi-
ciary Identification and Record Locator Subsystem File. This
file is a fairly complete and accurate (95%) database because it
is used to determine benefits to survivors of veterans [11].
The outcomes were the decline in PCS and MCS at the
18-month follow-up. The rationale for choosing `decline' was
because poor outcomes reflect potentially poor quality of care
[12]. The cut points for `decline' were based on two standard
errors of a point-in-time score, a similar strategy used in the
Medical Outcomes Study [3]. Decrements of more than -6.5
points in PCS scores have been associated with increased risk
of both hospitalization and mortality [12]. Declines in MCS
by more than -7.9 have been observed in those with clinical
depression compared to those without depression [13].
Patients who died were aggregated in the outcome of decline
in PCS but were excluded from MCS [3,14].
Choice of risk adjustors and data sources
We used three domains of risk adjustors: demographic and
socioeconomic information, diagnoses, and baseline health
status [15]. However, these concepts are not, strictly speaking,
independent domains of risk. The specifications of the rela-
tionships among the different domains of risk and change in
health status will be addressed in the rest of this section.
Sociodemographic data are considered proxies for pre-
existing physiological reserve as well as for preferences and
education, which may affect patients' perception of illness
and how they use the health care system. Information about
age and gender was obtained from the VHA Outpatient
Clinic File. Race, marital status, level of education, and
employment status, on the other hand, were patients' self-
reported data. We also included a VHA administrative proxy
for income, the means test, because the VHA uses it to clas-
sify patients based on their incomes (<$20,000 versus
>$20,000) for consideration of (co)payments for some serv-
ices such as medications and transportation to VHA facilities.
Diagnoses are the basis for understanding pathophysiol-
ogy, choosing therapy, and predicting health outcomes [16].
We categorized diagnoses using the Comorbidity Index, which
was developed to predict health status [17]. This diagnosis-
based case-mix measure uses conditions that are commonly
encountered in outpatient clinic visits. We calculated the
Comorbidity Index scores as the unweighted count of 30
medical and 6 mental conditions. We used ICD-9-CM diag-
noses from the VHA administrative files that were recorded
in 1 year (between January 1997 and January 1998).
Baseline health status is a significant predictor of change in
health status. Investigators have noted that high baseline
functioning was a predictor of worsened functioning [18],
whereas poor baseline health status was associated with sub-
sequent improvement [19]. We used tertiles of the baseline
PCS and MCS scores (`high', `intermediate', and `low') to min-
imize correlation errors with the outcome of change in health
status and to improve the interpretation of the resulting beta
coefficients.
Statistical analysis
Our first objective was to create clinically credible and statisti-
cally reliable risk-adjusted models to predict decline in PCS
and MCS. We used a random sample of 2/3 of the study
population (derivation sample of 21,215 subjects) to develop
the models. This was done in several stages to examine how
the selection of different dimensions of risk affects the
Use of risk-adjusted change in health status

performance of the models. We only retained variables signi-
ficant at the P  0.05 level in the final risk adjustment models
for the derivation sample. We then applied regression coeffi-
cients from those models onto the remaining 1/3 of the
sample (validation sample of 10,608 patients). We used two
measures to assess the performance of the models [15]. First,
we calculated the c-statistics test, which reflects the predictive
power of the models to discriminate among patients by ordering
them according to rates of the outcome event. A c-statistic
value of less than 0.5 indicates poor discriminatory power of
the model. Second, we used the Hosmer­Lemeshow statistic
test to evaluate the calibration of the model. Patients were
divided into deciles, based on the expected risk for decline in
PCS or MCS. Within each decile, the expected rate of
worsening was compared with the observed rate of worsen-
ing. A P-value greater than 0.05 indicates a good fit.
For our second objective, we calculated the case-mix as the
expected rates of decline in PCS and MCS at the network
level. This was accomplished by using the multivariate regres-
sion models to calculate the expected outcomes for each
patient in every network. Since patients who died were classi-
fied as `decline' in PCS, we used a previously developed
model to calculate the probability of death [20]. This was
done because the population on which death can be assessed
consists of all persons who completed the baseline survey,
but the population on which MCS and PCS can be assessed
consists of a different population of patients who completed
a follow-up survey. The following formula was used to com-
bine both probabilities to compute the expected decline rates:
[probability (death) + probability (decline in PCS) × (1 ­
probability (death)]. We applied analysis of variance to test for
differences in case-mix or expected rates among the 22 inte-
grated service networks.
For our third objective, we first examined whether net-
works had higher or lower `worse' rates than expected. To do
so, we compared each network's observed (unadjusted) rate
of decline with the expected rate of decline. To calculate the
observed decline in PCS rate, we used the following formula:
mortality rates + (1 ­ mortality rates) × (decline in PCS rates).
Second, we calculated adjusted rates of decline in PCS and
MCS at the network level. The adjusted rate for a network
was its observed rate divided by its expected rate, multiplied
by the mean of the rates observed for all networks. Next we
examined the number of networks that changed their rank
after adjustment with special attention to the identification of
outliers. We defined an outlier as being at least two standard
errors above (better) or below (worse) the mean predicted
change for the network average. Networks were blinded in
this analysis for purposes of confidentiality.
Results
Similar to the VA outpatient clinical population, the study par-
ticipants had a mean age of 64 (SD ± 12) years, 95% were
male, 80% were white, 64.5% had less than a high school edu-
cation, and 63% were married. The number of comorbid con-
ditions was on average 4 (SD ± 2). The average baseline PCS
and MCS scores were 32.7 (SD ± 11) and 42.8 (SD ± 13),
respectively. These scores are substantially lower than the gen-
eral US population in which the mean PCS and MCS are 50.
Among 31,823 veterans that were followed for 18 months,
1737 patients died (5.5%), 21,378 (67%) responded to a
mailed follow-up survey, 4328 (13.6%) showed a decline in
PCS scores greater than -6.5 points and 4322 (13.5%) had a
decline in MCS scores by more than -7.9 points.
Table 1 summarizes the associations of individual
patient characteristics and decline in PCS scores in the
derivation sample. Older patients, those with a higher
number of comorbidities, and those with a high baseline
PCS were more likely to have a decline in PCS. In contrast,
unmarried people, those employed, and those with high
baseline MCS scores were less likely to have a decline in
PCS. Race, gender, educational level, and income were not
significant predictors.
Table 2 summarizes the associations of individual patient
characteristics and decline in MCS in the derivation sample.
Older patients, those employed, and those with higher educa-
tion, income, and baseline PCS were less likely to have decline
in MCS. In contrast, patients with higher Comorbidity Index
scores (more comorbidities) and those with higher baseline
MCS were more likely to have worse MCS. Gender, race, and
marital status were not statistically significant predictors.
Table 3 summarizes the stepwise multidimensional risk ana-
lysis to predict decline in PCS scores greater than -6.5 points
and in MCS scores greater than -7.9 points. The performance
of the models improved by adding different dimensions of risk.
The final resulting model for decline in PCS scores
included only the statistically significant variables from Table 1
(age, marital status, employment, Comorbidity Index, and
baseline PCS and MCS). The c-statistic values of the model
for decline in PCS scores were 0.73 and 0.72 in the derivation
and validation samples, respectively. Model calibration was
confirmed with a non-significant Hosmer­Lemeshow statistic
test (2 = 10.86, P = 0.21, and 2 = 3.47, P = 0.90 in the deri-
vation and validation samples, respectively). The final result-
ing model for decline in MCS included only the statistically
significant variables from Table 2 (age, marital status, educa-
tion, income, employment, Comorbidity Index, and baseline
PCS and MCS). The c-statistic values of the model for decline
in MCS were 0.69 and 0.68 in the derivation and validation
samples, respectively. Model calibration was confirmed with a
non-significant Hosmer­Lemeshow test (2 = 14.4, P = 0.07)
in the derivation sample. Although the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test showed a P-value of 0.01 in the validation sample, the
expected and the observed rates of decline in MCS were simi-
lar, indicating an acceptable fit.
Figures 1 and 2 show the networks' case-mix, as measured
by the expected decline in PCS and MCS rates (dots). Expected
rates of decline in PCS by network ranged from 22.8 to 29.6%.
The range of expected rates of decline in MCS was from 20.0 to
23.2%. Analysis of variance confirmed that these 22 integrated
service networks differed significantly in their rates of expected
decline in PCS and MCS (P < 0.0001), which indicates signific-
ant differences in case-mix. The bars in Figures 1 and 2 denote
observed rates and the vertical lines with anchors indicate two

standard errors. When the expected rates (dots) are above or
below the anchored line, the observed rates are significantly
better or worse than expected. Most of the networks showed
differences between the observed and expected rates of decline
in PCS and MCS. Three networks (B, C, and U) had signifi-
cantly (P < 0.05) better than expected rates of decline in PCS
and one (K) had significantly (P < 0.05) better than expected
rates of decline in MCS. In contrast, there were four networks

Table 4 summarizes the networks' unadjusted and adjusted

works (B, C, and V) were identified as good outliers, whereas
networks G, N, and I were identified as bad outliers. After
risk adjusting rates of decline in MCS, two networks (G and P)
were identified as bad outliers.
Discussion
Accurate information on health outcomes has become an
expectation of regulatory and accreditation agencies. Impor-
tant decisions, such as reimbursements and accreditations, will
be based on perceived performance. Our study showed that it
is feasible to develop clinically credible risk adjustment models
with good statistical properties for the outcomes of decline in
PCS and MCS in outpatient care. The resulting models pro-
duced an expected rate for each integrated service network,
which we compared with its actual rate. There were significant
case-mix differences across the 22 networks. Risk adjustment
altered the assessment of network performance when com-
pared to their unadjusted rates of decline in PCS and MCS.
The rates of decline in PCS and MCS in the VHA were sim-
ilar to those in other population-based studies such as the
Health Outcome Survey [21]. However, we found that the
rates across networks differed significantly even after compre-
hensive risk adjustment. The fact that we found networks with
lower-than-expected rates of decline in PCS and MCS, for
example, suggests that some networks are doing better than
expected. This opens the possibility of examining these net-
works to identify processes of care or management practices

Use of risk-adjusted change in health status

that may serve as models of best practices. In contrast, greater
rates of decline are often attributed to poor quality of care and
may serve to identify those networks that need to improve
health care services through activities such as disease manage-
ment programs or behavioral health practice guidelines.
In highlighting differences in case-mix across the inte-
grated service networks, our study provides further evidence
for the importance of risk adjustment, which made a differ-
ence for ranking most networks when compared with unad-
justed rates. Some networks moved to lower ranks, meaning
that their performance improved relative to other networks,
whereas others moved to higher ranks, suggesting that they were
not doing so well. In addition, we found that several networks
had risk-adjusted rates of decline in PCS and MCS that were
two standard errors below (better) or above (worse) the over-
all mean. Since this rate is a strong indicator of a problem,
such findings could give networks a much better understand-
ing of their performance and greater certainty about the need
for quality improvement.
The associations among sociodemographic characteris-
tics, diagnoses, and decline in PCS and MCS were consistent
with the literature [3]. However, controlling for sociodemo-
graphics and comorbid illnesses explained only a fraction of
the variance in the outcomes measured. The same is true in
other studies [22]. Health status at baseline was a strong sig-
nificant predictor of decline in PCS and MCS scores.
Patients with higher baseline physical and mental health
were more likely to have a decline in PCS and MCS scores
compared with those with lower baseline physical and mental
health, respectively.
We should note some limitations of this study. First, in
patients who have low PCS or MCS scores at baseline, the
VR-36 questionnaire may be insensitive to further decline,
which would bias against documenting worsening health sta-
tus in patients who are already severely ill (`floor effect').
Against this is the finding of other investigators that over half
of the patients with low health status reported that their
health status subsequently declined [23]. In addition, our find-
ings did not change when we altered the cut-points of change
using those from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey
(decline in PCS and MCS scores greater than -5.7 and -6.7
points for PCS and MCS, respectively), thus leaving more
room for decline. Second, we are missing follow-up informa-
tion on some patients. This is unlikely to have affected our
findings since baseline PCS and MCS scores between those
with and without missing follow-up data showed only small
differences (PCS = 33.4 ± 11 versus 32.6 ± 11 and MCS =
40.9 ± 13 versus 42.8 ± 13, respectively). The patients without
follow-up data tended to be younger and therefore probably
were less likely to have a decline in health status, which would
bias our findings conservatively. Third, the c-statistics values
suggest a modest predictive power of the models [15]. This
represents an opportunity for future work that may lead to
improved model performance and possibly further change in
judgements of network performance.
In summary, this study advances our understanding of the
clinical predictors of decline in PCS and MCS. We have
developed a risk-adjustment model for decline in health status
that can be used to assess this important outcome of ambula-
tory care. VHA as well as non-VHA initiatives can incorpo-
rate this methodology into their process of measuring and
reporting performance of health care systems. Although not
the focus of this study, future efforts can begin to identify the
processes of care that may affect patient centered outcomes.
