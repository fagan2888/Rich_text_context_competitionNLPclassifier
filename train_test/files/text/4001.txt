Introduction
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the stomach
are rare and comprise about 0.1­0.6% of all gas-
tric cancers [Matsubayashi et al. 2000]. However,
gastric NETs have increased in incidence [Modlin
et al. 2003, 2004]. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has proposed a classification of NETs of
the digestive system based on the Ki-67 index
(grade 1, 2%; grade 2, 3­20%; and grade 3,
>20%) [Hamilton and Aaltonen, 2000]. As of
now, NETs are classified into the following
subclasses: NETs, grade 1 (carcinoid); atypical
carcinoid tumors (well-differentiated neuroendo-
crine carcinomas), grade 2; poorly differentiated
neuroendocrine carcinomas (small and large cell
type), grade 3. Rindi and colleagues have pre-
sented the `European Neuroendocrine Tumor
Society (ENETS) TNM staging of foregut
(neuro) endocrine tumors: a consensus proposal
including a grading system based on Ki-67 index
and mitosis' [Rindi et al. 2006], and Pape and
colleagues have examined the prognostic rele-
vance of a novel TNM classification system for
upper gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors (GEP-NETs) [Pape et al. 2008]. Recently,
ENETS published consensus guidelines for the
standard of care in NETs: `Towards a standard-
ized approach to the diagnosis of GEP-NETs and
Comparison of relapse-free survival in

grade 3) and gastric carcinoma

Abstract
Background: We compared relapse-free survival (RFS) in gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma
(WHO grade 3) and gastric carcinoma (GC). This is one of very few studies that compare the
prognosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (WHO grade 3, G3 NEC) with that
of GC.
Methods: Between 1996 and 2014, 63 patients were diagnosed with G3 NEC of the stomach
and 56 with gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with GC at Asan Medical Center in Seoul,
Korea. We also randomly selected 762 patients diagnosed with GC between 1999 and 2008.
Results: Patients with G3 NEC tumors that invaded the muscularis propria or shallower had
poorer RFS than those with GC of the same type, while G3 NEC that invaded the subserosa or
deeper had similar RFS to GC of that type. Patients diagnosed with G3 NEC with N0 or N2 had
poorer RFS than the corresponding patients with GC, while those who had G3 NEC with N1 or
N3 had similar RFS to the corresponding patients with GC. G3 NEC patients had poorer RFS
than well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated GC patients, while
G3 NEC patients had similar RFS to that of those with signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC). In
addition, patients with G3 NEC of stages I or IIa had poorer RFS than those with corresponding
GC, while G3 NEC stage IIb or greater had similar RFS to the corresponding GC.
Conclusions: Non-advanced G3 NEC showed poorer RFS than GC excluding SRC, while
advanced G3 NEC has a similar RFS to that of GC without SRC. Therefore, we recommend that
patients with non-advanced G3 NEC of the stomach be given a more aggressive treatment and
surveillance than those with non-advanced GC excluding SRC.

their prognostic stratification based on TNM
classification' [Kloppel et al. 2009]. However, the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
(7th edition) proposed that high-grade neuroen-
docrine carcinomas and mixed glandular/well-
differentiated NETs should be staged according
to the guidelines used for staging carcinomas at
that site [Edge et al. 2010]. Thus, the staging sys-
tems for NETs are not yet unified worldwide.
It is generally regarded that gastric neuroendocrine
carcinomas (NECs) are extremely malignant
because they have aggressive biological behavior
and frequently metastasize to lymph nodes and the
liver, even in the early stages of the disease [Matsui
et al. 1991]. It has been suggested that angioinva-
sion, tumor size, clinicopathological type, mitotic
index and Ki-67 labeling index are predictors of
tumor malignancy and patient outcome [Rindi et al.
1999]. However, there have been only few reports
supporting this view [Jiang et al. 2006; Kubota et al.
2012]. In addition, Kim and colleagues reported
that the small cell type of gastric NEC did not have
such extreme behavior [Kim et al. 2013]. We sought
to find reports that compared gastric NEC (WHO
grade 3, G3) with gastric carcinoma (GC) in terms
of relapse-free survival (RFS), but were unable to
find such studies. We therefore presumed that a
study on RFS comparison in NEC/GC would be a
valuable addition to the current clinical knowledge
in gastric cancer.
Methods
Between 1996 and 2013, 63 patients were diag-
nosed with poorly differentiated G3 NEC of the
stomach, and 56 were diagnosed as mixed type at
the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. Mixed
type was defined as NET mixed with GC. None
of the tumors had metastasized and all were cura-
tively resected. All tissues were reviewed by a
pathologist and classified according to the WHO
2010 classification [Hamilton and Aaltonen,
2000]. We also selected 762 patients with GC
according to the following criteria: availability of
entire specimen; blood samples; full follow-up
records; and records of genetic analysis between
1999 and 2008. None had distant metastases at
diagnosis and all underwent curative resection.
We used the AJCC (7th edition) TNM classifica-
tion for these tumors [Edge et al. 2010].
We compared the basic clinical features and sur-
vival data for the G3 NEC versus mixed type pair,
for the G3 NEC versus GC pair, and for the GC
versus the mixed type pair. RFS was defined as the
time from resection to recurrence or last contact.
We then evaluated clinical outcomes and RFS
according to depth of invasion, nodal stage, AJCC
TNM stages and histologic differentiation.
Numeric data are expressed as means with stand-
ard deviations, and compared using Student's
t-test. Risk factors were analyzed using the chi-
square test. Survival data were examined using the
Kaplan­Meier method with the log-rank test. All
statistical data were performed using SPSS 21.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software; a p value
below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
This study received approval from Asan Medical
Center's Institutional Review Board.
Results
Subgroup clinicopathologic analysis: grade 3
neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed type and
gastric carcinoma
All 63 G3 NEC patients had invasion of the sub-
mucosa or deeper, and only 2 (3.7%) of the 56
patients with mixed types showed confinement to
the mucosal layer. However, 196 (25.6%) of the
GCs were confined to the mucosal layer. There
were distinctive clinicopathologic differences
between G3 NEC and GC (Table 1): patients with
G3 NEC were older than those with GC (p <
0.05), and they experienced more lymph node
metastases, had higher stages and suffered more
tumor recurrence than did the GC patients (p <
0.05). Patients of the mixed type were also older
than those with GC (p < 0.05) and experienced
more lymph node metastases and higher stages (p
< 0.05). In addition, they had a higher proportion
of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet
ring cell carcinoma (SRCs) than the patients with
GC (p < 0.05), while showing a lower proportion
of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (p < 0.05).
Figure 1 shows Kaplan­Meier estimates of RFS.
Patients with G3 NEC had a lower survival rate
than the other two groups (p < 0.05), who had
similar RFS values (p > 0.05).
Adjuvant chemotherapy
We could not compare the adjuvant chemother-
apy regimen between the three groups of tumors

as a function of mucosal layer involvement
because none of the G3 NEC was confined to the
mucosa. We reviewed the adjuvant chemotherapy
regimens administered for the patients. A total of
39 (61.9%) of the GC NEC patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy and 21 (53.8%) of them
received intravenous chemotherapy. A total of 37
(66.1%) of the mixed type patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy, 14 (37.8%) received
intravenous chemotherapy, and 14 received
oral plus intravenous chemotherapy. For GC,
292 patients (38.3%) received adjuvant chemo-
therapy and 165 (56.5%) of them received oral
plus intravenous chemotherapy. Regimens of
oral chemotherapy or intravenous chemotherapy
differed between G3 NEC and GC and between

mixed type and GC. However, regimens of oral
plus intravenous chemotherapy differed only
between mixed type and GC. In stage 2 cancer, a
similar proportion of patients in each group
received chemotherapy. The route of chemother-
apy administration differed between subgroups.
Matched-pair analysis according to depth of
invasion
We analyzed the relation between clinicopathologic
data and depth of invasions. For invasions reaching
either the submucosa or the muscularis propria, the
results were similar. In the submucosal layer, G3
NEC had more aggressive behavior, including
lymph node metastasis and tumor recurrence, and
poorer RFS than GC (p < 0.05). The mixed type
also had poorer RFS than the GC. In the muscula-
ris propria tumors, G3 NEC again exhibited more
aggressive behavior, including lymphovascular
invasion and tumor recurrence, and poorer RFS
than the GC (p < 0.05), and the mixed types had
poorer RFS than the GC as well. In the subserosal
layer or beyond the subserosa, the results differed
from those in the submucosa and muscularis pro-
pria: in the subserosal layer, there were no signifi-
cant differences in lymph node metastasis and
tumor recurrence between any groups (p > 0.05)
and a similar trend was seen in the serosal layer.
Therefore, we divided the cases into two groups.
Group 1 (Table 2) contained tumors invading the
submucosa or muscularis propria; group 2 (Table
3) contained tumors invading the subserosa or
beyond the subserosa. The G3 NEC in group 1
had more aggressive behaviors, including lym-
phovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis and
tumor recurrence, than did the GC (p < 0.05).
They also had poorer RFS than the mixed type
and GC (Figure 2a), which had similar RFS
(Figure 2a) (p > 0.05). In contrast, there were no
statistically significant differences in surgical out-
comes including lymph node metastasis and
recurrence between the various types in group 2
(Figure 2b) (p > 0.05)
RFS according to nodal group, histologic
differentiation and TNM stage
We evaluated RFS according to nodal stage. In N0
and N2, G3 had poorer RFS than the other two
groups (p < 0.05), between which there was no
difference in RFS (p > 0.05). However, in N1 and
N3, there was no difference in RFS between any
groups (p > 0.05). We evaluated RFS according to
the histologic differentiation of the GC. G3 NEC
had poorer RFS than well-differentiated, moder-
ately differentiated or poorly differentiated GC
(Figure 3a­c, p < 0.05). However, the RFS was
similar to that of SRC GC (Figure 3d, p < 0.05).
We also evaluated RFS according to TNM stage.
In stage I, G3 NEC and the mixed type had poorer
survival than GC (p < 0.05), but there was no dif-
ference in RFS between G3 NEC and mixed type
(p > 0.05). In stage IIa, G3 NEC had poorer sur-
vival than the other two groups (p < 0.05), but
there was no difference in RFS between G3 NEC
and mixed type and between mixed type and GC
(p > 0.05). In stage IIb, IIIa, IIIb or IIIc there was
no difference in RFS between any groups (p <
0.05). Therefore, we divided the stages into two
groups: stage I and IIa in group 1; and stage IIb
through to IIIc in group 2. The G3 NEC in group
1 had poorer survival than the mixed type and GC
(Figure 4a, p < 0.05), and there was no difference
in survival between mixed type and GC (p > 0.05).
In group 2 there was no difference in RFS between
any of the types (Figure 4b, p > 0.05).
Discussion
The WHO and ENET grading systems according
to Ki-67 index/mitosis have been validated for the
foregut and particularly for pancreatic neuroen-
docrine neoplasm (NEN)s (PanNENs), and their
biological relevance and power to discriminate

among prognostic groups has been widely con-
firmed [Ekeblad et al. 2008; Fischer et al. 2008;
Pape et al. 2008; La Rosa et al. 2009; Scarpa et al.
2010]. However, the TNM stages of the AJCC
and ENET have not yet been unified. In the
AJCC (7th edition), the T categories for GC,
NEC and adenocarcinoma with NET are: T1 ­

NET are defined as: T1 ­ tumor invading the
lamina propria or submucosa and 1 cm or less in
size; T2 ­ tumor invading the muscularis propria
or >1 cm in size; T3 ­ tumor penetrating the sub-
serosa; and T4 ­ tumor invading serosal or other
organs or adjacent structures [and for any T, add
(m) for multiple tumors]. In contrast, ENET
TNM stage is uniform for all gastric NET or
NEC, unlike GC TNM stage. In this study we
evaluated the TNM stage uniformly according to
the AJCC (7th edition) definitions of GC, NEC,
and adenocarcinoma with NET.
Gastric NET frequently contains an adenocarci-
noma component [Waldum et al. 1998; Nishikura
et al. 2003], and it has been proposed that gastric
NET is derived predominantly from endocrine
precursor cell clones arising in earlier adenocarci-
noma components that transform into endocrine
tumors during rapid clonal expansion [Nishikura
et al. 2003]. A category of mixed adeno-neuroen-
docrine carcinoma (MANEC) was recently pro-
posed on the grounds that WHO 2010 did not
define cases with both neuroendocrine and
non-neuroendocrine components [La Rosa et al.
2012]. In addition, there are no studies that sup-
port the 30% rule for the definition of MANEC.
Thus, WHO 2010 classification is likely to be cor-
rect in the light of the evidence for the MANEC
definition [Rindi et al. 2014]. Kim and colleagues
reported that the neuroendocrine features of GC
appeared to be correlated with clinicopathologic
parameters such as high stage and high frequency
of regional lymph node metastasis [Kim et al.
2011]. In our study, we could not establish the
exact proportions of each component. Therefore,
we defined NETs with any proportions of adeno-
carcinoma as a mixed type.
Recently, Park and colleagues evaluated the clin-
icopathologic features of GCs with neuroendo-
crine differentiation (NED) and found no
significant difference in the survival rate between
NEC and GC with 10­30% of NED [Park et al.
2014]. They therefore proposed that GCs with
10% NED should be differentiated from con-
ventional adenocarcinomas. They also recom-
mended that the 10% NED cut-off may be
useful in practice and may serve as an informative
parameter for predicting patient outcomes and
establishing optimal therapeutic guidelines for
GCs with NED.
Several studies have already shown that NEC of
the stomach has a poor prognosis [La Rosa et al.
2011; Ishida et al. 2013]. However, there are few
reports that have evaluated the prognostic signifi-
cance of neuroendocrine components of GC
[Jiang et al. 2006; Kubota et al. 2012]. In addi-
tion, Kim and colleagues reported that the small
cell type of gastric NECs did not have such
extreme behavior [Kim et al. 2013], and Kubota
and colleagues reported that early detection and
curative operations are essential for improving the
prognosis of gastric NEC [Kubota et al. 2012].
Our study has the following limitations. NETs of
the stomach are very rare; therefore, the statistical
power of this study was limited by the relatively
small number of patients. Recently, WHO 2010

defined MANEC as requiring >30% of each
component. However, as mentioned above, we
could not determine the exact proportions of the
components, so we defined NETs with any por-
tion of adenocarcinoma as mixed type. Another
weakness is the lack of data on the expression of
neuroendocrine markers in the control group. In
addition, various adjuvant chemotherapy regi-
mens were administered for patients in each type
of tumor and the regimens differed widely among
subgroups. Our study may also be prone to selec-
tion bias because the patients were selected
according to the following criteria: availability of
entire specimen, blood samples, full follow-up
records, and records of genetic analysis.
In conclusion, even though the number of patients
with GC NEC was very small and different adju-
vant chemotherapy regimens were administered,
our results show that G3 NEC has a worse prog-
nosis than GC. G3 NEC tumors that invade only
as far as the muscularis propria have poorer RFS
than the corresponding cases of GC, while those
that invade the subserosa or deeper have similar
RFS to GC. Therefore, non-advanced G3 NEC
of the stomach requires more aggressive treat-
ment and surveillance than does GC, excluding
the SRC type.
Ethical standards
All procedures followed were in accordance with
the ethical standards of the responsible commit-
tee on human experimentation (institutional and
national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of
1964 and later versions. Informed consent or its
alternative was obtained from every patient in
