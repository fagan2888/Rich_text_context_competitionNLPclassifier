Risk of mercury-associated adverse health
effects (e.g., neuropsychological deficits)
in children after in utero methylmercury
(MeHg) exposures increases as Hg exposure
rises [Mergler et al. 2007; National Research
Council (NRC) 2000]. Blood Hg (BHg)
and hair Hg concentrations are indicators of
the magnitude of MeHg exposure. National
estimates for the United States are based on
data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) (Mahaffey
et al. 2004; McDowell et al. 2005). Mercury
concentrations in blood obtained from
women of childbearing age who participated
in NHANES have been collected by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
on a continuing basis since 1999. Hair Hg
concentrations were determined only in the
years 1999 and 2000 (McDowell et al. 2005).
Although the national estimates provide an
overview for the United States, indications of
regional differences within the United States
are suggested from local data (Bellanger et al.
2000; Karouna-Renier et al. 2008; Knobeloch
et al. 2005; McKelvey et al. 2007; Ortiz-
Roque and López-Rivera 2004; Sato et al.
2006; Sechena et al. 2003; Stern et al. 2001).
Women residing in New York City (McKelvey
et al. 2007), Hawaii (Sato et al. 2006), and
Florida (Karouna-Renier et al. 2008) had
both higher fish consumption and higher Hg
exposure than the national estimates from
NHANES (Mahaffey et al. 2004). These U.S.
data, as well as international data especially
from island communities (Dewailly and Pereg
2004; Hsu et al. 2007; Sakamoto et al. 2007;
Soong et al. 1991; see also Bermuda Biological
Stations for Research 2004) suggested the
importance of regional differences and proxim-
ity to coastal areas as predictors of increased
MeHg exposure. In the present article, we used
the NHANES data to identify differences in
distribution of BHg across the four major U.S.
Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South,
and West) and between coastal and noncoastal
areas of the United States.
Selecting a BHg concentration to use as
an index of excessive Hg exposure depends on
dose­response analysis. Over the past decade,
risk assessments describing association between
human exposures to MeHg and occurrence
of neurologic deficits have been developed
by multiple countries and organizations
[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Research 1999; Joint Food and Agriculture
Organization/World Health Organization
2003; NRC 2000; U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) 2001; European
Union 2002]. We discuss these risk assessments
in more detail in the Supplemental Material
[see especially Table 1 (http://www.ehponline.
org/
members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf)].
The current reference dose (RfD) used
by the U.S. EPA was based on cord blood
meas
urements and is associated with fetal
BHg concentrations of 5.8 µg/L (NRC 2000;
U.S. EPA 2001). However, differences have
been found between maternal and cord blood

concentrations due to bioconcentration of
MeHg across the placenta (Butler Walker
et al. 2004; Mahaffey et al. 2004; Mergler
et al. 2007; Morrissette et al. 2004; NRC
2006; Stern and Smith 2003). As a result,
maternal BHg concentrations as low as
approximately 3.5 µg/L may be a concern.
Therefore, we refer to BHg concentrations
exceeding 3.5 and 5.8 µg/L as levels of con-
cern for the purposes of this article.
Previous analyses of NHANES BHg data
(Mahaffey et al. 2004) confirmed fish and
shellfish consumption as the major source of
blood organic Hg for the U.S. population.
In the lower portion of the range of BHg
concentrations currently considered relevant
to the prevention of fetal neurotoxicity (i.e.,
~ 3.5 to 5.8 µg/L), organic Hg (i.e., MeHg)
accounted for approximately 90% of total
BHg for the general population not exposed
occupationally to Hg (Mahaffey et al. 2004).
NHANES data have been used to
describe the distribution of BHg concentra-
tions in a nationally representative sample
for adult women (Mahaffey et al. 2004) but
have not previously been used to character-
ize regional and coastal exposure patterns.
Analyses of NHANES data can be used
to characterize major U.S. Census regions
(Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) and
estimate population distributions in these

Adult Women's Blood Mercury Concentrations Vary Regionally
in the United States: Association with Patterns of Fish Consumption
(NHANES 1999­2004)

Background: The current, continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) has included blood mercury (BHg) and fish/shellfish consumption since it began in
1999. NHANES 1999­2004 data form the basis for these analyses.
Objectives: This study was designed to determine BHg distributions within U.S. Census regions
and within coastal and noncoastal areas among women of childbearing age, their association with
patterns of fish consumption, and changes from 1999 through 2004.
Methods: We performed univariate and bivariate analyses to determine the distribution of BHg
and fish consumption in the population and to investigate differences by geography, race/ethnicity,
and income. We used multivariate analysis (regression) to determine the strongest predictors of
BHg among geography, demographic factors, and fish consumption.
Results: Elevated BHg occurred more commonly among women of childbearing age living in
coastal areas of the United States (approximately one in six women). Regionally, exposures differ
across the United States: Northeast > South and West > Midwest. Asian women and women with
higher income ate more fish and had higher BHg. Time-trend analyses identified reduced BHg and
reduced intake of Hg in the upper percentiles without an overall reduction of fish consumption.
Conclusions: BHg is associated with income, ethnicity, residence (census region and coastal

proximity). From 1999 through 2004, BHg decreased without a concomitant decrease in fish con-
sumption. Data are consistent with a shift over this time period in fish species in women's diets.

broad regions. Unbiased population estimates
cannot be made for other U.S. geographic
subdivisions, such as coastal and noncoastal
regions, because weights have not been devel-
oped for them; however, distributional esti-
mates can be made.
Explaining patterns of MeHg exposure
is challenging because MeHg concentrations
within and among fish species are known to
vary by more than 10-fold (Mahaffey 2004;
NRC 2006). Regional distributions of BHg
and Hg exposure estimated from the patterns
of fish consumption (i.e., Northeast, Midwest,
South, and West, as well as overall coastal­
noncoastal differences) remain 
questions.
The purposes of the present study of Hg
exposures are to provide for the first time sep-
arate estimates of BHg distribution and fish
consumption for the individual U.S. Census
regions and for coastal and noncoastal popu-
lations. Such data are useful in determining
where to focus efforts to reduce Hg exposure.
The present analysis can be used to determine
a) distributions of BHg concentrations and
fish consumption that differ across the four
U.S. Census regions and between the coastal
and noncoastal populations, b) significant
temporal trends in BHg levels and fish con-
sumption between 1999 through 2004, and
c) BHg concentrations associated with racial/
ethnic and income level. Trends in patterns
of fish consumption, if present, could be used
to assess the impact of national fish adviso-
ries and Hg reduction programs. Data on
geographic/ethnic groups and socioeconomic
associations could be used to target interven-
tion programs. The regional results can be
generalized to provide population estimates
for the U.S. Census regions.
Materials and Methods
Methodology for data analysis. We evalu-
ated data for examinees who participated in
NHANES during survey years 1999­2004
to assess the statistical association between
seafood consumption and BHg by region of
residence, race/ethnicity, and annual income.
Further, we examined time trends for both
BHg and fish consumption. NHANES is an
annual survey conducted by the NCHS. The
data include BHg levels, 24-hr dietary recall,
and 30-day finfish and shellfish consumption
frequency for women 16­49 years of age who
reside in the United States. The NHANES
sampling frame includes all 50 states. The
documentation and publicly available data
for NHANES can be found online [Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
2006b]. The regional data are not publicly
available but can be accessed by special request
to the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) through its Research Data Center.
Procedures for submitting a proposal in order
to access data that are not publicly available
can be found online (CDC 2006c). We per-
formed all analyses using SAS, version 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Following NHANES analytic guide-
lines (CDC 2006a), we used SAS procedures
that accurately incorporate the stratification
and multistage sampling of NHANES: Proc
SurveyMeans, Proc SurveyReg, and Proc
SurveyFreq (SAS Institute Inc.). The weights
provided by NCHS compensate for the

oversampling of various subpopulations and
adjust for nonresponse bias. We used weights
for estimating statistics for coastal and non-
coastal regions to retain these adjustments.
Because we considered the variables of interest
(BHg and fish consumption) to be related to
some of the factors that were oversampled, we
retained these adjustments to minimize the bias
in the estimates. For example, NHANES over-
sampled Mexican Americans, who also have
lower BHg than do other racial/ethnic groups.
If the weights were not used to estimate the dis-
tribution of BHg, the results would be biased
low. We recognize that some bias may remain
within the estimates because the weights were
not specifically created for the geographic
regions of coastal and noncoastal; however,
these subdivisions (e.g., coastal, noncoastal,
Pacific, Atlantic) are based on counties, the
primary sampling units of NHANES (CDC
2006a). All multivariate analyses were done
unweighted because factors associated with
the dependent variables and for which over
sampling was based were included as co
variates
and thus adjusted for in the modeling.
In order to estimate long-term Hg intake,
we combined data collected through the 24-hr
dietary recall and the 30-day fish frequency
questionnaire to estimate 30-day Hg intake
[for specific methodologies, see Mahaffey
and Rice (1997); Mahaffey et al. (2004)]. If
we found statistically significant differences
in amount of fish consumed per meal from
the 24-hr dietary recall by either coastal sta-
tus (participants who lived in a county that
bordered the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans, the
Gulf of Mexico, or the Great Lakes vs. those
who did not) or data release (1999­2000,
2001­2002, or 2003­2004), we calculated
separate averages. We generated statistically
representative estimates from these data using
the statistical weights provided by NCHS and
following the relevant analytical guidelines
published by NCHS (CDC 2006a).
Methodology for defining coastal and non
coastal areas. Fish consumption is generally
believed to be a major contributor to BHg
concentration. We hypothesized that patterns
of fish and shellfish consumption would vary
between U.S. residents who live on or near the
coast (within ~25­50 miles) and those who
live inland. We further hypothesized that fish
consumption patterns, and thus BHg con-
centrations, may also vary by specific coast
(e.g., residents near the Atlantic Coast may
have different BHg concentrations than those
on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico) and spe-
cific inland region (e.g., West vs. Midwest).
To test these hypotheses, we categorized
NHANES respondents as living in either a
coastal or a noncoastal county and further cat-
egorized them by eight regions: Atlantic Coast,
Northeast, Great Lakes, Midwest, South, Gulf
of Mexico, West, and Pacific Coast.

The geographic unit used by NHANES is
a county or county equivalent (CDC 2006a);
therefore, we limited our definitions of coastal
and noncoastal to follow county boundaries. We
defined all counties that bordered the Pacific or
Atlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, or any
of the Great Lakes as coastal. Additionally, we
defined counties that bordered estuaries and
bays as coastal, as well as counties whose cen-
ter point was within approximately 25 miles
of any coast even if not directly bordering a
coast. [For the list of counties, see Supplemental
Material, Table 13 (http://www.ehponline.
org/
members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf).] We
then defined the four coastal regions based on
nearest body of water; for example, counties in
California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and
Hawaii that we defined as coastal were catego-
rized as Pacific Coast. We separated noncoastal
counties into four inland regions using the U.S.
Census regions; for example, noncoastal coun-
ties in California, Oregon, Washington, and
Alaska along with the entire states of Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, Utah, and Nevada became the West
region (we classified all of Hawaii as coastal).
We also designated the entire state of Florida as
coastal, split between the Atlantic Coast and the
Gulf of Mexico. We designated Miami-Dade
County as Atlantic Coast, and Monroe County
as Gulf of Mexico. These subdivisions run the
risk of small sample sizes; however, the defini-
tion of coastal was sufficiently broad to avoid
single primary sampling units.
Results
Table 1 shows the distributions of estimates
of the number of women with BHg con-
centrations > 3.5 µg/L and > 5.8 µg/L, by
region. Analyses indicate that between 1999
and 2004, the Northeast had the highest per-
centage of women with BHg concentrations
above the 3.5 µg/L level of concern (> 19%),
whereas the South had the largest estimated
number of women (1.21 million) with  3.5
µg/L BHg because of elevated population
in that region. Geometric means (Figure 1)
show similar trends, with the highest BHg
concentrations in the Northeast, followed
by the West, South, and Midwest census
regions. In the Northeast, the highest 5%
of BHg concentrations exceeded 8.2 µg/L.
[For full distributions, see Supplemental
Material, Table 2 (http://www.ehponline.org/
members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf).] When
we included coastal regions in this analy-
sis, additional spatial heterogeneity in BHg
(Figure 2A) and estimated 30-day Hg intake
(Figure 2B) was apparent, with elevated expo-
sures in all coastal areas relative to their neigh-
boring inland regions except in the Great
Lakes. In the coastal areas, the highest 5%
of BHg concentrations exceeded 7.2 µg/L,
with the Atlantic Coast exceeding 10.9 µg/L.
[For the full distributions, see Supplemental
Material, Table 4 (http://www.ehponline.
org/members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf).] Fish
species eaten by survey participants varied by
region (Figure 3), with respondents in coastal
regions reporting higher frequency of con-
sumption of fish containing higher levels of
Hg. BHg concentrations were strongly associ-
ated with the frequency of fish consumption
(Figure 4). BHg increased with monthly esti-
mated consumption of fish and shellfish over
the range of never/rarely to 4 or more times
per week. In multiple regression modeling,
women from the Atlantic (p < 0.01), Pacific
(p < 0.0001), and Gulf (p < 0.0001) coasts
had higher BHg concentrations compared
with women from the inland West, whereas

women from the inland Northeast and inland
Midwest had significantly lower BHg levels
(p < 0.0001). [For the full regression results,
see Supplemental Material, Table 11 (http://
www.ehponline.org/members/2008/11674/
suppl.pdf).]
Analysis of temporal trends through sim-
ple regression modeling showed no statistically
significant difference among the three sets of
study years (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and
2003­2004) for BHg (p = 0.07), estimated
30-day Hg intake (p = 0.11), or reported fre-
quency of seafood consumption (p = 0.69).
However, in multiple regression modeling,
adjusting for covariates including coastal/non-
coastal residence, the years 1999­2000 had
significantly higher BHg levels (p < 0.0001)
compared with 2003­2004, and 2001­2002
had significantly lower BHg levels (p < 0.01)
[Supplemental Material, Table 11 (http://
www.ehponline.org/
members/2008/11674/
suppl.pdf)]. Although the analyses did
not support the conclusion that there was
a general downward trend in BHg concen-
trations over the 6-year study period, there
was a decline in the upper percentiles reflect-
ing the most highly exposed women with
BHg concentrations greater than established

levels of concern [Supplemental Material,
Table 9 (http://www.ehponline.org/mem-
bers/2008/11674/suppl.pdf)]. In addition,
the percentage of examinees with BHg values
 3.5 µg/L and  5.8 µg/L was much greater
in 1999­2000 compared to 2001­2002 and
2003­2004 (Figure 5). We found no con-
sistent trend in fish consumption across the
study years. We observed a decrease in the
90th percentile of 30-day estimated intake of
Hg through seafood consumption across the
study years even though there was no simi-
lar decrease in the 90th percentile of 30-day
estimated consumption of grams of fish and
shellfish (Figure 6). This suggests a shift in
consumption to seafood containing less Hg.
We did not observe a similar pattern at the
mean, suggesting that this shift in seafood
consumption occurred mainly with the high-
est fish and shellfish consumers [Supplemental
Material, Table 9 (http://www.ehponline.org/
members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf)]. The RfD
for Hg intake is 0.1 µg Hg/kg body weight
(µg/kgbw
) per day, or 3.0 µg Hg/kgbw
per
month (30 days).
Results also showed that self-selected eth-
nic identity was associated with total BHg
concentrations, estimated 30-day Hg intake,
and frequency of either finfish or shellfish
consumption. For example, BHg levels,
reported frequency of seafood consumption,
and 30-day Hg intakes were highest among
women who designated themselves as being
in the "other" category (mostly people whose
ancestry is Asian, Native American, Pacific
Islands, and the Caribbean Islands). [See also
Supplemental Material, Tables 5­7 (http://
www.ehponline.org/members/2008/11674/
suppl.pdf).] Table 2 presents the percentages
of women by race/ethnicity that had  3.5
and  5.8 µg/L BHg.
We identified statistically significant
relationships between higher income and,
respectively, increasing BHg concentration
(p < 0.0001), estimated 30-day intake of Hg
(p = 0.008), and 30-day frequency of fin-
fish and shellfish consumption (p < 0.0001)
through bivariate regressions. [For the dis-
tributions of blood total Hg, estimated Hg
intake, and frequency of finfish and shell-
fish consumption by annual income, see
Supplemental Material, Tables 6­8 (http://
www.ehponline.org/members/2008/11674/
suppl.pdf).] In addition, women from fami-
lies reporting incomes of  $75,000 (the ref-
erence category) had statistically higher BHg
levels than did women from families with
incomes of  $55,000 (p < 0.01). In all cases,
BHg concentrations were also significantly
associated with age and estimated 30-day Hg
intake (p < 0.0001). Table 3 presents the per-
centage of women by annual income with
 3.5 and  5.8 µg/L BHg.
In multiple regression modeling, after
adjusting for other factors related to BHg,
both race/ethnicity and income remained
statistically significant predictors of BHg
levels observed in this study [Supplemental
Material, Table 11 (http://www.ehponline.
org/members/2008/11674/suppl.pdf)]. Non-
Hispanic blacks (p < 0.0001) and women
grouped in the "other" racial category (p =
0.002) had significantly higher BHg concen-
trations than did non-Hispanic whites.
Discussion
Regional and coastal variation in BHg
concentrations and in fish consumption.
Comparisons of the distribution of BHg data
with reference values aimed at protecting the
fetal nervous system have been made using
national-level data (Mahaffey et al. 2004).
NHANES data are often used to make
population estimates through application of
weighting factors to variables of interest such
as BHg. Population estimates for U.S. Census
regions and their distribution of BHg con-
centrations indicate that women living in the

U.S. blood Hg concentrations: regional and coastal estimates
Environmental Health Perspectives · volume 117 | number 1 | January 2009 51
Northeast had BHg concentrations exceeding
levels of concern more often than did women
living in the South and West. The lowest Hg
exposures were reported among women living
in the Midwest.
Because NHANES was not designed to
provide population estimates for coastal and
noncoastal areas, unbiased estimates for the
number of women having BHg concentra-
tions  3.5 µg/L and  5.8 µg/L cannot be
developed comparing coastal- and noncoastal-
residing women. Although the following are
not population estimates, they are statistics
for a geographic region: Women living in
coastal areas were at greater risk of having
BHg concentrations  3.5 µg/L (16.25% for
coastal and 5.99% for noncoastal residents)
and  5.8 µg/L (8.11% for coastal and 2.06%
for noncoastal residents). Women living near
the coastal areas had approximately three to
four times greater risk of exceeding acceptable
levels of Hg exposure than did noncoastal-
dwelling women. There may be some bias
in these results due to the weighting issues
(see "Materials and Methods"); however, we
do not believe that this bias is a major factor
underlying these great differences.
MeHg exposures exceeding health-based
standards, including U.S. EPA's RfD (Rice
et al. 2003), occurred more commonly
among women living in coastal areas. These
health-based standards were based on avoid-
ing MeHg-associated delays and deficits in
neurologic development of children after
in utero exposure to MeHg (Mergler et al.
2007; Rice et al. 2003). At higher exposures
to MeHg, including the highest concentra-
tions reported during these survey years, the
women themselves may risk adverse neuro
psychological and neurobehavioral outcomes
(Mergler et al. 2007).
Within the United States, people living in
coastal areas consume more fish and shellfish
than do those living in noncoastal areas and
consume fish with higher Hg concentrations.
Reports from New York City (McKelvey
et al. 2007) and Florida (Denger et al. 1994;
Karouna-Renier et al. 2008) support our
identification of higher Hg exposures in U.S.
coastal areas. This is part of a worldwide pat-
tern. An overall pattern of higher BHg levels
has also been reported among people living
on U.S. islands [Hawaii (Sato et al. 2006)]
and territories [e.g., Puerto Rico (Ortiz-
Roque and López-Rivera 2004)]. A similar
pattern has been repeated in other islands
[Bermuda (Dewailly and Pereg 2004; see also
Bermuda Biological Stations for Research
2004), Fiji (Kumar et al. 2006), Seychelles
(Myers et al. 2007), and Tahiti (Chateau-
Degat 2005; Dewailly et al. 2008)] com-
pared with inland populations. Among these
island populations, BHg concentrations at
the upper end of the distribution fall into the
range of 50 µg/L (~ 250 nmol/L) and higher
(Chateau-Degat 2005). In Bermuda, cord
BHg concentrations as high as 160 nmol/L
(~ 35 µg/L) have been reported (arithmetic
mean, 41.3 ± 4.7 nmol/L or 8.0 ± 1.0 µg/L)
(Dewailly and Pereg 2004; see also Bermuda
Biological Stations for Research 2004).
Higher BHg concentrations in the U.S.
Northeast found in this study reflect, in part,
more frequent fish and shellfish consump-
tion. Additional variability may be a function
of differences in Hg concentrations among
species and geographic regions (Sunderland
2007). For example, recent information on
"hot spots" for Hg in wildlife tissues (Evers
et al. 2007) could be associated with higher
Hg concentrations for locally obtained fish.
One limitation of the present analysis was the
use of a fish-species­specific mean Hg concen-
tration (i.e., nondistributional values) to esti-
mate individual exposure. Although most fish
consumed by the U.S. population is not locally
obtained (i.e., commercially obtained from
diverse regions and countries) (Sunderland
2007), analytical results showing geographic
differences in the distribution of BHg could
reflect higher Hg concentrations in locally
obtained fish within the Northeast states.
Ethnic group variation on fish intake
and BHg concentrations. Ethnic origins were
associated with Hg exposures with those des-
ignated as "other" (i.e., Asian, Pacific and
Caribbean Islander, Native American, Alaska
Native, multiracial, and unknown race) having
higher BHg concentrations. From additional
studies, people of Asian descent whose food
choices are influenced by Asian dietary pat-
terns (Kudo et al. 2000; Sechena et al. 2003)
tended to consume fish more frequently, in
greater variety, and in greater quantity than did
non-Asians. The ethnic diversity of the U.S.
population is well known. As of 1997, 61%
of the Asian population living in the United
States was foreign-born (Council of Economic
Advisors 1999). By comparison with overall
U.S. data, higher BHg concentrations among
Asians and islanders were reported for Taiwan
(Hsu et al. 2007), Cambodia (Agusa et al.
2007), Fiji (Kumar et al. 2006), and Tahiti
(Dewailly et al. 2008).
Within the United States, fish and shell-
fish consumption, predicting Hg exposure
described previously, varies widely, in part
a reflection of ethnicity. For example, Asian
countries [e.g., Cambodia (Agusa et al. 2007),
Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2007; Soong et al. 1991),
Japan (Murata et al. 2007; Sakamoto et al.
2007)], island nations [e.g., Bermuda (Dewailly
and Pereg 2004; see also Bermuda Biological
Stations for Research 2004), Seychelles (Myers
et al. 2007), Tahiti (Chateau-Degat 2005),
Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2007; Soong et al. 1991),
Japan (Murata et al. 2007; Sakamoto et al.
2007)], and some European countries [e.g.,
Spain (Falcó et al. 2006; Herreros et al. 2008)
and the Faroe Islands (Weihe et al. 1996)]
have reported fish/shellfish consumption levels
greater than average worldwide consumption
(World Health Organization 2008).
Income differences in association with fish
intake and BHg concentrations. In contrast
to some other environmental exposures [e.g.,
higher blood lead concentrations] (Mahaffey
et al. 1982), BHg concentrations increased
with income. This is consistent with other
studies in which women from higher income
groups were at greater risk of MeHg expo-
sure, as were women living in urban areas
(Hightower and Moore 2003; Saint-Phard
and Van Dorsten 2006).
Interactions between income and ethnic
group. A more complex association between
income and racial/ethnic group may also
exist. According to the 1990 U.S. Census
(U.S. Census Bureau 2008), the median fam-
ily income of Japanese-American families
exceeded that of non-Hispanic white fami-
lies. By contrast, the income of Cambodian-
American families was lower than that of
black families. We could not address whether
there is an interaction between belonging to
the category designated as "other" and higher
income within the NHANES data on BHg
levels available at this time, because of sample
size limitations.
Time trends in Hg exposure absent
changes in total fish consumption. Our analy-
sis of 30-day Hg intake indicated that there
was no consistent trend in fish consumption
by women of childbearing age over the 6-year
period between 1999 and 2004. Our evalua-
tion of NHANES fish intake data indicated no
differences in the mean frequency or amount of
particular fish and shellfish species consumed.
However, the estimated 30-day Hg intake
decreased at the 90th percentile and higher,
whereas total fish consumption did not, which
suggests a shift in fish species consumed. The
BHg data indicated a reduction of the higher
end of the distribution of BHg between the
first 2-year interval (the 1999 and 2000 exam-
inees) compared with the subsequent 4-year
interval (the 2001­2004 examinees).
The basis for these differences could pos-
sibly reflect spillover from the federal fish
advisory program (U.S. EPA 2008b) in terms
of total fish and shellfish consumption. A
recent analysis of a nationally representative
study specifically addressing fish-consump-
tion patterns did not support this suggestion
(Bradbury 2007).
The four fish species listed in the federal
advisory [swordfish, shark, tilefish, and king
mackerel (U.S. EPA 2008b)] were rarely
reported by the 5,465 women in this analysis.
It is clear that these four fish species con-
tributed little to Hg exposure in this gen-
eral population of U.S. women. Individual

states with higher Hg exposures [e.g., Hawaii
(Sato et al., 2006), Florida (Karouna-Renier
et al. 2008)] and greater fish consumption
[Florida (Denger et al. 1994)] have substan-
tially broader fish consumption advisories
(e.g., Hawaii and Florida) aimed at reducing
Hg exposure from high-Hg­containing spe-
cies obtained locally (Florida Department
of Health 2007; U.S. EPA 2008b). Despite
the federal advisory's emphasis on four spe-
cies of highly contaminated fish (U.S. EPA
2008b) and the states' emphasis on game-
fish, the most commonly consumed finfish
in the United States is tuna. Interpretation
of Hg exposure from tuna was complicated
by the specific wording of the dietary ques-
tions asked of the NHANES examinees,
which did not differentiate between light or
skipjack tuna and albacore tuna. The latter
contains approximately three times more Hg
than does the former: 0.38 µg/g for frozen
and fresh tuna, 0.35 µg/g for canned alba-
core, and 0.12 µg/g for canned light tuna
(Mahaffey et al. 2008).
Changes in MeHg exposure over time.
During the past decade, the U.S. EPA initi-
ated substantial interventions aimed to reduce
Hg releases and exposures (U.S. EPA 2008a)
and issued advisories to limit consumption
of high-Hg fish (U.S. EPA 2008b). Because
of worldwide atmospheric distribution and
subsequent deposition of Hg, local condi-
tions and locally caught fish are not the main
contributors to Hg intake for most people
(Sunderland 2007). Although there are eco-
nomic indications that consumption of some
species of fish may have decreased in response
to these advisories (Shimshack et al. 2007),
Hg exposures may not follow a similar time
trend despite regulatory efforts to reduce Hg
exposures. A recent analysis of a nationally
representative study specifically addressing
fish-consumption patterns did not support
this suggestion (Bradbury 2007). Our analy-
sis of NHANES data calculating 30-day Hg
intake indicated that there was no consis-
tent trend in fish consumption by women
of childbearing age over the 6-year period
between 1999 and 2004.
Conclusions
Significant geographic differences in BHg
concentrations occurred within the United
States: We found highest exposures in coastal
areas and the Northeast census region. In the
Northeast, 19% of women had BHg con-
centrations  3.5 µg/L. The highest 5% of
BHg concentrations exceeded 8.2 µg/L in
the Northeast and 7.2 µg/L in coastal areas,
concentrations more than twice the 3.5 µg/L
level of concern. BHg levels were predicted
by the quantity and type of fish consumed.
Over the 6-year period (1999­2004), the
frequency of elevated BHg levels among
women of childbearing age declined without
a significant change in quantities of fish and
shellfish consumed. This pattern suggests a
more discerning series of choices in type of
fish eaten rather than an overall reduction
in fish consumption. Within all geographic
regions, women at highest risk of elevated Hg
exposures were more affluent and more likely
to be of Asian or island ethnicity.
