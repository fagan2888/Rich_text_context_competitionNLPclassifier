Introduction
The estimated global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) for 2010 would be 285 million people, which is
projected to increase to 438 million in 2030; a 65%
increase.1 Similarly, for India this increase is estimated to
be 58%, from 51 million people in 2010 to 87 million in
2030.1 The impacts of T2DM are considerable: As a life-
long disease, it increases morbidity and mortality and
decreases the quality of life.2
The significance of genetic factors in the predisposition
to this microvascular complication (retinopathy, neuropa-
thy, etc.) can be realized from the fact that various genes
have been implicated in susceptibility to diabetic nephropa-
thy,3,4 including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
gene of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE is a
dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that removes the C-terminal
dipeptide from angiotensin I to produce the potent vasocon-
strictor and growth-promoting substance angiotensin I/I.
The ACE gene is mapped on chromosome 17q23 encoded
by a 21 Kb gene that consists of 26 exons and 25 introns.5,6
Insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs 4646994) of a
287 bp Alu repeat sequence in introns 16 of the ACE gene
is strongly associated with plasma and cellular ACE levels,
and it indicates that the polymorphism may modulate the
expression of the ACE gene.7 Several studies have reported

Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is growing in an epidemic manner across the world with an expected dou-
bling of the incidence to millions of affected individuals in the last decades. At present, adequate data are not available
regarding the ACE and FABP2 polymorphisms and their susceptibility with T2DM cases in the North Indian population.
Thus we conceived the need for further study of ACE (I/D) and FABP2 (Ala54Thr) genes polymorphism and its susceptibil-
ity to T2DM in the North Indian population.
Materials and methods: In this study, a total of 300 subjects (including 190 T2DM cases and 110 controls) participated.
ACE and FABP2 gene polymorphisms in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restric-
tion fragment length polymorphism.
Results: The frequencies of ACE I/I, I/D and D/D genotypes in T2DM cases and controls were 28.73%, 55.17%, 16.09%
and 13.63%, 57.95%, 28.40%, respectively. The frequencies of FABP2 Ala54Ala, Ala54Thr and Thr54Thr in T2DM cases
were 18.39%, 66.66%, 14.94% and 22.72%, 61.36%, 15.90% in controls, respectively. ACE I/I genotype was significantly
more frequent in cases as compared to controls (p = 0.003, 2 = 9.13).
Conclusion: It appears that the ACE I/I genotype frequency was significantly higher in the T2DM cases as compared to the
controls.

the involvement of the D allele of the ACE gene in hyper-
tension and T2DM in various populations.8­10 In a study
carried out on South Indian diabetic nephropathy patients,
a significantly high frequency (80.2%) of the D allele was
reported compared to T2DM cases with normal urine albu-
min.11 The I/I, I/D and D/D genotypes resulting from the
polymorphic site of the ACE gene have been shown to have
low, intermediate and high plasma expression, respectively.
With that, the I/I genotype has been thought to confer pro-
tective benefits while the D/D genotype is believed to con-
fer deleterious effects on various disease pathogenetic
mechanisms, particularly diabetic nephropathy.12 In addi-
tion, characterization of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism
has also been suggested for decision making regarding anti-
hypertensive treatment regimens.13
Fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) genes play a key
role in the absorption and intracellular transport of dietary
long chain fatty acids. The gene for FABP2 is located in the
long arm of chromosome 4. The G to A polymorphism
(rs1799883) of codon 54 results in the substitution of threo-
nine (Thr) for alanine (Ala).14 Carriers of the Thr54 allele in
FABP2 have a twofold greater affinity for the absorption of
the long-chain fatty acids than those with the Ala54-
containing FABP2.15 The associations between the FABP2
Ala54Thr polymorphism and increased fasting insulin (FI)
concentration, fasting fatty acid oxidation and reduced glu-
cose uptake were identified in Pima Indians, an extreme
population with high prevalence rates of obesity and
T2DM.14 Earlier studies have shown that the FABP2 Thr54
allele is significantly associated with higher total choles-
terol, with stroke incidence,16 elevation of fasting and post-
prandial triglyceride (TG),17 insulin resistance14,18and
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations.19 Currently,
adequate data are not available regarding ACE I and FABP2
genes polymorphism and its susceptibility with T2DM
cases in the North Indian population. Thus we conceived
the need for further study of ACE (I/D) and FABP2
(Ala54Thr) gene polymorphisms and their susceptibility to
T2DM in the North Indian population.
Materials and methods
Patient selection
A total of 190 blood samples of T2DM cases and 110
healthy controls were collected from the diabetic clinic of
the Department of Medicine of Era's Lucknow Medical
College and Hospital, Lucknow with prior consent. Data
collection was done for each patient on clinical variables,
including age, alcohol consumption, body mass index
(BMI), height, weight, cigarette smoking, family history,
etc. Patients with overnight fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
of more than 126 mg/dl on two consecutive events were
included in the T2DM category while samples having a
fasting blood glucose (FBG) level below 110 mg/dl without
family history of diabetes were included in the study as
controls. Patients with type 1 presentation, defined as dia-
betic ketoacidosis, acute presentation with heavy ketonuria
(>3+), or uninterrupted requirement of insulin within one
year of diagnosis, were excluded. Ethical committee clear-
ances were obtained from the respective departments prior
to the recruitment of subjects in this study.
Biochemical estimations
BMI was calculated according to the Quetelet equation by
using weight in kilograms/height in meters squared. Serum
creatinine (s. creat.) concentration was assessed by a kinetic
Jaffe's method. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and random
blood glucose (RBG) (glucose oxidase-peroxidase method),
serum cholesterol (cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase), serum
TG (glycerol phosphate oxidase-peroxidase-amidopyrine
method), High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
(immunoinhibition) were assessed by an XL-300 Transasia
Fully Auto Analyzer Transasia, Mannheim, Germany. Very
low-density lipoprotein was determined by enzymatic
method. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels
were calculated by using the Friedewald formula.20
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) was measured using a semiau-
toanalyzer (Transasia, Mannheim, Germany).
DNA extraction
Five milliliters of peripheral blood was collected from all
the subjects in 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) tubes. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole
blood using the standard phenol-chloroform extraction
method.21 DNA concentration was determined by spectro-
photometer and stored at -20°C.
Analysis of polymorphisms
ACE polymorphism
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed for
genotyping of the ACE I/D polymorphism. Reactions
were performed with 10 pmol of each primer:22 forward
primer 5'-CTGGAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3', reverse
primer 5'-GATGTGGCCATCTTCGTCAGAT -3', in a
final volume of 20 l containing 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM
KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 0.5 mM of each dNT and
2U Taq polymerase. PCR amplification was carried out
under these conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5
minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
45 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 1.15 minutes, extension
at 72°C for 2.30 minutes and final extension at 72°C for 5
minutes. PCR products were separated on 2.0% ethidium
bromide-stained agarose gel and visualized by a UVP
BIOLMAGING gel doc system. The products were 490 bp
for allele I and 190 bp for allele D (Figure 1).

FABP2 polymorphism
PCR was employed for genotyping of the FABP2 gene pol-
ymorphism. Reactions were performed with 10 pmol of
each primer:23 forward primers 5'-ACAGGTGTTAATAT
AGTGAAAAG-3' and reverse primer 5'-TACCCTGAG
TTCAGTTCCGTC-3', in a final volume of 20 µl contain-
ing 0.3 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 10 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH
8.3, 50 mmol/l of KCl, 1.5 mmol/l of MgCl2 and 100
mmol/l of dNTPs. PCR amplification was carried out under
these conditions: 35 cycles for 1 minute at 94°C, 1 minute
at 5°C and 1 minute at 72°C; the PCR products were ana-
lyzed on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to
certify the proper amplification. The amplified PCR prod-
ucts of 180 bp were digested with the addition of 2 U HhaI
(New England Biolabs), 10 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 50
mmol/l NaCl, 10 mmol/l MgCl2
and 1 mmol/l dithiothrei-
tol. After incubation at 37°C for two hours, digested sam-
ples were separated on 10% ethidium bromide-stained
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by a
UVP BIOLMAGING gel doc system. PCR products having
an intact HhaI site were cleaved into 99- and 81-bp frag-
ments; the Ala54Thr substitution abolished the restriction
site (Figure 2).

Results
Our study includes 190 T2DM cases (129 males and 61
females) and 110 controls (60 males and 50 females). The
mean age of cases in this study was 41.29 ± 11.39 years,
while in the control group 40 ± 10 years. The age of onset
(years) in T2DM cases was 44 ± 11 years. Clinical and
biochemical parameters of cases and controls are shown
in Table 1. The mean BMI, blood pressure, RBG, FBG,
HbA1C, total cholesterol (s. chol.), high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (VLDL-C), TG and s. creat. levels in the dia-
betic patients were significantly higher than the control
subjects (p < 0.001). We have found significant correla-
tion of RBS with HbA1C, s. chol. and TG (p < 0.001,
p = 0.007, p = 0.049), s. creat with HbA1C, TG and VLDL
(p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p < 0.001), s. chol. with TG and
HDL (p = 0.001, p < 0.001), VLDL with HDL and TG (p
= 0.019, p < 0.001). The frequencies of the ACE D/D, I/D
and I/I genotypes in T2DM cases and controls were
16.09%, 55.17%, 28.73% and 28.40%, 57.95%,13.63%,
respectively (p = 0.378, 0.623, 0.003; X2 = 0.78, 0.24,
9.13; power = 0.816, 0.759, 0.999). The frequency of the
ACE I and D allele in T2DM cases and controls were
56.32%, 43.68% and 42.61%, 57.39% (p = 0.001, 0.001;
X2 = 10.30, 10.30; power = 0.999, 0.999). The frequencies
of FABP2 Ala54Ala, Ala54Thr and Thr54Thr genotypes
in T2DM cases and controls were 18.39%, 66.66%,
14.94% and 22.72%, 61.36%, 15.90%, respectively
(p = 0.369, 0.379, 0.867, X2 = 0.81, 0.77, 0.03; power = 0.82,
0.817, 0.874). The frequency of Ala54 and Thr54 allele in
T2DM cases were 51.72% and 48.28% as compared to 53.40%
and 46.60% in the controls (p = 0.752, 0.752; X2= 0.10,
0.10; power = 0.796, 0.796). The genotype and allele fre-
quencies of ACE and FABP2 and statistical analysis among
the cases and controls are also shown in Table 2.
Discussion
ACE polymorphism
The frequency of ACE gene polymorphism is quite varia-
ble in different geographic and ethnic groups, and it is
also used as a marker in population structure analysis
(Table 3). Bonnet (2008) reported in healthy subjects that
the D allele conferred an increased risk of having glucose
tolerance by decreasing insulin sensitivity.24 On the other
hand, D allele was associated with a reduction in insulin
secretion.24,25 Allelic frequency of ACE I and D in
Japanese cases with T2DM26 were 57.14% and 42.85%,
which is similar to our data, where the frequency of ACE
I allele is 56.32% and D is 43.68%. A positive association
between the D allele (I/D and D/D genotype) of ACE pol-
ymorphism and diabetic nephropathy was found in
patients with T2DM in South India.11,27 ACE D/D geno-
type frequency in our study was 16.09%, which is compa-
rable to the 18.15% ACE D/D frequency reported in
Taiwanese cases with T2DM.28 A significant relationship
was observed between the D/D genotype of ACE

polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy29 in Iranians.
The frequency of the D allele is considerably lower,
27.9%, in Malaysians, compared to Caucasians30,31
(56.73%) and North Indians (43.68%, our study). The fre-
quency of I allele is 72.1% in Malaysian30 patients with
T2DM, which is higher in comparison with our data,
where I allele is 56.32%. The observed I/I genotype fre-
quency in our study was 28.73% in T2DM cases, which is
higher in comparison with Caucasian 10.6%, UK 17.77%,
Turkish 18.88% and Australian patients 20.96%.31­34 In
our study ACE D/D genotype frequency was 16.09% in
T2DM cases, which is lower than the Caucasians, having
43.26% of ACE D/D genotype in T2DM cases.
Lee and Tsai (2002) reported a strong association of the
I/I genotype with insulin resistance in T2DM patients.35
Our data also showed a stronger association of the I/I geno-
type in T2DM patients. On analyzing the ACE gene poly-
morphisms in cases and controls, the I/I genotype was
significantly more frequent in cases as compared to con-
trols (p <0.05) (Table 2).
FABP2 polymorphism
The FABP2 gene has been proposed as a candidate gene
for diabetes and insulin resistance because the protein it
encodes is involved in fatty acid absorption and metabo-
lism.18 Numerous studies have assessed FABP2 gene var-
iants and their association with insulin resistance and
T2DM. The most studied variant is the Ala54Thr varia-
tion at codon 54, a missense variant that has a definite
effect on the primary structure of the protein and affects
its fatty acid binding properties. Previous studies have
found a significant association between the FABP2 geno-
type and occurrence of T2DM or decreased insulin
sensitivity.14 Several studies have reported associations
between this polymorphism and insulin resistance, BMI,
dyslipidemia, stroke, metabolic syndromes and hypertri-
glyceridemia.14,16,18,36 Our study revealed higher levels of
serum TGs and higher BMI in Thr54 homozygotes in
agreement with the earlier studies of Carlsson et al.,16
who demonstrated similar elevations of TG levels in the
Thr54 homozygotes. Vimaleswaran (2006) reported that
the Ala54Thr variant was extensively associated with
hypertriglyceridemia.36 Previous studies have failed to
establish ascertainable associations between the FABP2
gene and T2DM in Asian Indians.11 The frequency of
FABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism described in other popu-
lations fluctuates between 37% and 45% (Table 3) as in
T2DM cases in the United States (36.93%), Sweden
(41.9%), Japan (40.62%), Britain (44.77%), Korea
(41.66%) and India (42.04%).16,17,23,36­38 The frequency
of the Thr54Thr genotype in our study was 14.94%,
which is similar to the frequency of the Thr54Thr geno-
type that is 15.62% in Japanese and 13.54% in Korean23,38
populations. The frequency of the Ala54Ala genotype in
our study was 18.39%, which is lower than 50.74% in
British and 56.4% in Swedish T2DM cases.16,37
Significant differences were not observed in the geno-
typic and allele frequencies between the T2DM cases and
controls in our study.
Conclusions
In this case-control study, it appears that the ACE I/I geno-
type frequency was significantly higher in the T2DM cases
as compared to the controls, while the FABP2 gene poly-
morphism shows no significant difference in genotypes and
allele frequencies found in the cases and controls. It might
