In this study, we attempted to identify threshold values
for kidney function measures that maximally discriminate
short-term mortality, to identify major population segments
in which these thresholds apply, and to classify the
hierarchical rank of the thresholds when other classic risk
factors are also considered. To do this we retrospectively
identified estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
urinary albumin­creatinine ratio (ACR) thresholds to
maximize sensitivity and specificity predictions for death
in non-institutionalized NHANES III participants,
representative of the United States population from 1988 to
1994 and followed through 2000. In a classification tree
excluding dichotomizing variables, age 57 years was initially
selected; ACR appeared in the second round and eGFR in the
third. The prognostic discrimination of optimum eGFR and
ACR thresholds exceeded those of commonly advocated
public health screening measures, such as LDL cholesterol
and fasting blood glucose, with body mass index appearing
in the third round, and smoking and LDL cholesterol in the
fourth. In a tree permitting dichotomizing variables, the ACR,
systolic blood pressure, and glucose first appeared in the
third round, with eGFR, smoking, and LDL in the fourth. Thus,
the albumin­creatinine ratio and eGFR may be at least as
efficient for survival-based clinical triage as most other classic
risk factors.

KEYWORDS: albumin­creatinine ratio; estimated glomerular filtration rate;
mortality; survival
Chronic kidney disease is common, and is associated with
cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death
risks in community settings.1­4 Hence, it is reasonable to
question whether kidney function tests should be routinely
recommended for community-dwelling adults, in much the
same way that blood pressure, lipid, and blood glucose
measures are recommended periodically.
Before considering screening, it is useful to evaluate how
different threshold levels perform in relation to predicting
major health outcomes. In the context of death within finite
intervals, thresholds at which individuals classified as
`normal' show low mortality rates (high proportion of true
negatives) and those classified as `abnormal' show high
mortality rates (high proportion of true positives) are
attractive for selecting subgroups in which more intensive
follow-up and treatment may be appropriate. As gains in
sensitivity are accompanied by losses in specificity, the
threshold of maximum combined sensitivity and specificity
is a logical selection.
Regarding kidney function and mortality in the general
population, there are many unknowns: should creatinine-
based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary
albumin­creatinine ratio (ACR), or both be used? At what
levels? Are optimal threshold values the same in all segments
of the community? As declining kidney function correlates
with many other classic mortality risk factors, is it more
efficient to screen for factors like blood pressure, lipids, body
mass index, and blood glucose? In this nationally represen-
tative study, thresholds with maximum sensitivity and
specificity values (MaxSn þ Sp
) were identified with a receiver
operating characteristic approach,5 and classification tree
methodology was used to assess the performance of eGFR,
ACR, and classic cardiovascular risk factors as mortality
discriminators among community-dwelling adults.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the non-institutionalized US population
between 1988 and 1994, based on the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), are shown
in Table 1. Mean age was 44.9 years; 53.2% were women,
9.4% were African American, and 5.0% were Hispanic. Mean
eGFR was 99.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the median urinary
ACR value was 5.7 mg/g. Older age was associated with lower

eGFR (r ¼ À0.76) and higher serum creatinine (r ¼ 0.24) and
ACR (r ¼ 0.09) levels. Other positive correlations included
female sex; self-reported hypertension, diabetes, and cardio-
vascular disease; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; body
mass index; waist­hip ratio; low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol; C-reactive protein; and glucose. Negative corr-
elations of age included African American and Hispanic race-
ethnicity and smoking.
The death rate was 10.0 per 1000 person years; 8.7% of the
study population died during a mean follow-up interval of
8.7 years. Sensitivity and specificity values for predicting
death at different eGFR and ACR thresholds are shown in
Figure 1. Sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) values for a
threshold eGFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were 0.25 and 0.98,
respectively, and for an ACR threshold of 30 mg/g, 0.27 and
0.94, respectively. MaxSn þ Sp
thresholds were 94 ml/min per
1.73 m2 for eGFR (Sn/Sp, 0.80/0.67) and 9 mg/g (0.62/0.75)
for ACR. When the study population was randomly split into
five similarly sized subgroups, maximum MaxSn þ Sp
levels for
eGFR were 85 (0.70/0.79), 94 (0.81/0.73), 95 (0.83/0.63), 93
(0.78/0.68), and 87 (0.68/0.78) ml/min per 1.73 m2. Corre-
sponding values for ACR were 12 (0.63/0.82), 12 (0.57/0.81),
10 (0.52/0.76), 9 (0.64/0.76), and 9 (0.64/0.79) mg/g. In
the subgroup with diabetes, MaxSn þ Sp
thresholds were
76 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for eGFR (0.49/0.82) and 12 mg/g
(0.73/0.57) for ACR; corresponding values for the subgroup
with hypertension were 83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (0.69/0.69)
and 12 mg/g (0.64/0.70).
MaxSn þ Sp
thresholds for other intrinsically continuous
variables are shown in Table 2, as are mortality odds ratios.

aSensitivity, the proportion of the population who died with the risk factor; specificity, the proportion of the population who survived without the risk factor. Thresholds for
intrinsically continuous variables (those showing maximum combined true positive and negative predictive values for predicting death) were determined by applying the
following increments: 1-unit increments to ACR (range 1­100 mg/g), age (20­90 years), BMI (18­40 kg/m2), eGFR (30­120 ml/min per 1.73 m2), glucose (70­140 mg/dl), HDL
cholesterol (30­80 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (70­200 mg/dl), and systolic blood pressure (90­150 mm Hg); 0.1-unit increments to CRP (0.3­2.5 mg/l); and 0.01-unit increments to
creatinine (0.50­2.00 mg/dl) and WHR (0.70­1.40). ORs (with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses) were calculated from logistic regression models with death (no/yes) as
outcome variable. The comparator for all variables was absence of the indicated condition. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-recommended analytical
procedures were followed and the sampling weights implicit in this complex sample survey design were used; WTPFSD6, SDPPSU6, and SDPSTRA6 as weight, cluster, and
stratum variables, respectively.

40.3mg/l, LDL cholesterol 4148mg/dl, self-reported diabetes,
body mass index 426 kg/m2, and male sex. In a similar analysis
in the subgroup with self-reported diabetes, age 462 years was
the first-ranked discriminator (Sn/Sp 0.84/0.67), followed by
systolic blood pressure 4136mm Hg (0.59/0.75), eGFR
p76 ml/min per 1.73m2 (0.49/0.82), ACR 412mg/g (0.73/
0.57), self-reported cardiovascular disease (0.42/0.88), LDL
cholesterol 4165 mg/dl (0.32/0.87), HDL cholesterol
p41 mg/dl (0.59/0.6), and C-reactive protein 40.3mg/l
(0.52/0.63). Among participants with self-reported hyper-
tension, age 465 years was the first-ranked discriminator
(0.68/0.79), followed by eGFR p83ml/min per 1.73m2 (0.69/
0.69), systolic blood pressure 4136mm Hg (0.72/0.63), ACR
412mg/g (0.64/0.70), self-reported cardiovascular disease
(0.33/0.92), serum creatinine 40.97mg/dl (0.40/0.83), glucose
4109mg/dl (0.35/0.79), waist­hip ratio 40.91 (0.78/0.36),
C-reactive protein 41.4mg/l (0.14/0.95), and self-reported
diabetes (0.15/0.92).
Because its MaxSp þ Sn
for predicting death or survival was
highest, age 457 years was the first item chosen in the
classification tree, and it formed the basis for the first two
subgroups chosen, ages p57 and 457 years. When an
otherwise identical approach was used in the subgroup aged
p57 years and age was not considered, systolic blood
pressure 4120 mm Hg was the best discriminator; ACR
412 mg/g was selected for the subgroup aged 457 years
(Table 2, Figure 2a). eGFR first appeared in the third round
in two branches of the classification tree: age p57 years and
systolic blood pressure 4120 mm Hg, eGFR p105 ml/min
per 1.73 m2; age 457 years and ACR p12 mg/g, eGFR
p63 ml/min per 1.73 m2. ACR also appeared in the fourth
round: age p57 years, systolic blood pressure 4120 mm Hg
and body mass index 426 kg/m2, ACR 47 mg/g. eGFR also
appeared in the fourth round: age 457 years, ACR 412 mg/g
and no cardiovascular disease, eGFR p62 ml/min per
1.73 m2; age 457 years, ACR 412 mg/g and cardiovascular
disease, eGFR p49 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Regarding other
classic risk factors, body mass index first appeared in the
third round of the classification tree, and smoking and LDL
cholesterol in the fourth round.
When age was not excluded as a candidate variable, age
444 years and age 474 years, respectively, were the best
mortality discriminators in the subgroups aged p57 and
457 years (Table 2). Figure 2b shows the corresponding

ACR also appeared in the fourth round, in two subsets (ACR
411 mg/g in the subset aged p44 years with glucose
496 mg/dl; ACR 47 mg/g in the subset aged 45­57 years
with systolic blood pressure p124 mm Hg. eGFR first
appeared in the fourth round (eGFR p60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 in the subset aged 480 years). Regarding other
classic risk factors, glucose and systolic blood pressure first
appeared in the third round of the classification tree, and
smoking and LDL cholesterol in the fourth round.
Table 3 shows mean ages, death rates, and mortality odds
ratios when the terminal nodes of the two classification trees
were used to classify the study population. Overall, both
classification systems appeared to exhibit satisfactory mor-
tality discrimination characteristics, with or without adjust-
ment for age, as C-statistics were X0.85 in each model.
DISCUSSION
We attempted to identify threshold values for kidney
function measures that maximally discriminate short-term
mortality, to identify major population segments in which
these thresholds apply, and to identify the hierarchical rank
of the thresholds when other classic risk factors are also
considered. We found that optimal eGFR and ACR thresholds
showed prognostic discrimination close to optimal age
thresholds, and, except for systolic blood pressure, higher
discrimination than exhibited by optimal values of com-
monly advocated public health screening measures such as
LDL cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. For urinary ACR,
the maximally discriminatory threshold value was consider-
ably lower than the values usually used to define micro-
albuminuria. Finally, classification tree analysis suggested that
measures of kidney function were most discriminatory in

older segments of the population, possibly because of their
strong positive correlation with age.
From a public health perspective, discrete threshold values
of intrinsically continuous risk factors are often used identify
individuals at higher risk who might benefit from more
extensive follow-up and treatment with established therapies.
For adverse health outcomes like death, one common
approach involves examination of risk ratios across several
risk factor levels, with risk estimates in the exposed
population appearing in the numerator and risk estimates
in the non-exposed population appearing in the denomi-
nator of the risk ratio. However, this approach ignores the
prevalence of risk factor levels, and it can easily be shown
that, depending on prevalence, thresholds defined by
maximum risk ratio gradients may not maximize the
combined proportions of true positive and true negative
predictions. If reduced mortality is the major goal, it is
difficult to argue against using a threshold that maximizes the
chances of `good' levels of the risk factor predicting survival
and `bad' levels predicting death.
Many studies have examined associations between kidney
function and death/survival. For example, a PubMed search
of human studies in April 2010 with the search terms
(mortality or survival) (glomerular filtration rate or albumi-
nuria or chronic kidney disease) and (community or general
population) yielded 1230 citations. Adding the terms
`sensitivity' and `specificity' reduced this number to 72
citations, and adding the term `threshold' resulted in zero
citations. Thus, although many studies have examined
associations between levels of kidney function and mortality,
few if any have attempted to establish threshold values of
maximum combined sensitivity and specificity. A notable
recent community-based study from Norway used diagnostic
test methodology to evaluate the ability of eGFR and
albuminuria, as continuous variables, to predict end-stage
renal disease and found that both variables provided
complementary information.6 Another community-based
study from Sweden attempted to identify optimal creatinine
clearance thresholds for the outcomes fatal or nonfatal
myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in 2176
50-year-old men without diabetes or cardiovascular disease.7
Follow-up extended to age 70 years. Optimal eGFR thresh-
olds were 98 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for myocardial infarction
and 92 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for cardiovascular death. Some-
what paralleling the observations in this study, the authors
concluded that optimal eGFR thresholds for discriminating
cardiovascular risk in the general population may be higher
than generally appreciated.
When using intrinsically continuous variables to define a
`disease,' using the same criteria for clinical triage in a public
health setting may not be optimal. For example, eGFR and
ACR thresholds of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 30 mg/g seem
to be very far from optimal in this study; only a small fraction
of individuals who died during the study were identified with
these criteria. In addition, this study does not support the
primacy of eGFR over ACR, or vice versa, for clinical triage;
both measures were discriminatory, albeit in different
segments of the population. These findings mirror findings
of other recent community-based studies with death and
end-stage renal disease as outcomes.8­10
The limitations of this study deserve scrutiny. Gold
standard techniques, such as inulin or radioisotope clearance
to measure GFR and accurately timed urine collection to
measure urinary albumin excretion, were not used. As eGFR is
calculated with age, and age is a potent predictor of mortality,
the prognostic discrimination of eGFR may be inflated.11 As
serum creatinine and urinary ACR were measured only once,
identification of participants with progressive loss of kidney
function was not feasible. The accuracy of cause-specific
mortality determination has not been assessed in NHANES III
and we did not attempt to identify eGFR and ACR thresholds
for renal and cardiovascular death. This study examined the
US population between 1988 and 1994, and generalizability of
our findings to other countries and other times cannot be
guaranteed. Similarly, these findings may not be generalizable
to hospital and out patient settings. No attempts were made to
weigh sensitivity differently from specificity. For public health
screening, confidence that a test has a high true negative rate
might be attractive from a service provision perspective; in
contrast, missing certain conditions might be so catastrophic
that high false positive test rates could be justified. This being
said, applying relative weights to true-negative and true-
positive test results requires value judgments, whether by
individuals, the caring professions, or those who decide public
health policy. Thus, we made no attempt to differentially
weigh sensitivity and specificity in this study. Finally, we only
examined short-term mortality, which is strongly associated
with age or with variables highly correlated with age, such as
kidney function. Whether reduced kidney function is causally
related to the increased short-term mortality in older adults is
not known.
Despite these limitations, we believe this study has useful
features. The study population is large, and, by design,
representative of the US population from 1988 to 1994. Several
commonly measured risk-stratification measures, such as blood
pressure, glucose, lipids, and body mass index were carefully
measured, and study participants were examined in a fasting
state. Defining discrete threshold values that discriminate
between death and survival may help current efforts to establish
clinical guidelines for chronic kidney disease,12,13 but future
studies that identify risk factors for premature mortality instead
of short-term mortality are needed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objectives
Among adult participants in NHANES III (1988 and 1994), the
objectives of this study were:
1. To identify eGFR and ACR thresholds with maximal sensitivity
and specificity (MaxSn þ Sp
) for death through 31 December 2000
(8.7 years of follow-up);
2. To use classification tree analysis (based on MaxSn þ Sp
) to rank
eGFR and ACR thresholds in a framework considering other

major mortality risk factors, especially those commonly recom-
mended for screening in community-dwelling adults.
Study population and measurements
NHANES samples are multistage, cross-sectional, stratified, clustered
probability samples of the non-institutionalized US civilian popula-
tion. NHANES III was performed in two phases (1988­1991 and
1991­199414); as recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics,15,16 data from the 1988­1991 and 1991­1994 sub-popula-
tions were combined in this study. Population subgroups of elderly,
Mexican American, and non-Hispanic African American participants
were systematically oversampled. Participants were interviewed at
home, and physical examinations and blood and urine collections
were performed at mobile examination centers. For this study, we
limited the study population to participants examined in a mobile
examination center after 12h fasting, aged X20 years, with serum
creatinine and urinary albumin­creatinine measurements.
Serum creatinine was measured by the kinetic alkaline picrate
method at the White Sands Research Center (Coulston Foundation)
laboratory (Alamogordo, NM, USA) with a Roche/Hitachi 737
analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Serum creatinine
measurements were aligned to standardized creatinine measured at the
Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH, USA).17 In
summary, a random sample of 200 stored specimens was obtained
from participants aged X60 years and creatinine was measured with a
coupled enzymatic assay (creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase;
kits no. 1775677 and 1775766) on a Roche P Module instrument.
College of American Pathologists Creatinine Accuracy Calibration
Verification/Linearity Survey LN24 samples were used to confirm
traceability to methods based on isotope dilution gas chromato-
graphy mass spectrometry. Ultimately, standardized creatinine values
(in mg/dl) were calculated from actual creatinine, as follows:
standardized creatinine ¼ 0.960 Â actual creatinineÀ0.184.
For GFR estimates, the body-surface-area-adjusted Cockcroft­-
Gault equation,18­20 the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease equation,21,22 the Mayo Clinic equation,23 and the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula24 were all
assessed. As findings were similar with all four equations, only
findings using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collabora-
tion equation are reported, calculated from the following functions
of age and serum creatinine (Scr, mg/dl):
African American, female, Scr p0.7: eGFR ¼ 166 Â
(Scr/0.7)À0.329 Â (0.993)age
African American, female, Scr 40.7: eGFR ¼ 166 Â

White or other race, male, Scr 40.9: eGFR ¼ 141 Â
(Scr/0.9)À1.209 Â (0.993)age
Urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations were measured at
the University of Minnesota, (Minneapolis, MN, USA) from
random urine spot samples by the modified kinetic Jaffe method
with a Synchron AS/Astra Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
CA, USA). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations were
measured by nephelometric immunoassay (Department of Labora-
tory Medicine, Immunology Division, University of Washington,
Seattle, Washington, DC, USA). Current smokers were defined by
affirmative answers to the questions `Do you now smoke cigarettes?'
and `Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?' Diabetes,
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (previous history of
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke) were
defined by self-report.
Outcomes
Vital status for NHANES III participants was ascertained through
31 December 2000, through linkage with death certificate data in the
National Death Index. To protect confidentiality, the public use file
was subjected to data perturbation techniques that introduce
statistical noise into the dataset to reduce the risk of identification.
Synthetic dates were substituted for actual dates of death for
selected deceased participants, whereas information regarding vital
status was not perturbed. A validation study has shown that
mortality hazards ratios from the public access, perturbed dataset
closely correspond with those from the restricted access, unper-
turbed dataset.25
To identify mortality MaxSn þ Sp
levels for eGFR, sensitivity
(exposure among those who died) and specificity (non-exposure
among those who survived) were computed separately for whole-
number eGFR thresholds between 30 and 120 ml/min per 1.73 m2
and for ACR thresholds between 1 and 100 mg/g. To assess the
reproducibility of eGFR and ACR thresholds, we randomly split the
dataset into five similarly sized subgroups and calculated MaxSn þ Sp
levels. As the discriminatory power of many variables might reflect
correlations with other variables, most notably age, we constructed
classification trees for death based on the highest MaxSn þ Sp
across
all variables, provided P-values for mortality association were o0.05
with logistic regression. At any given node, subsequent branches
were defined by MaxSn þ Sp
, a process repeated within subgroups
until four orders of dichotomization had been completed. Two four-
level classification trees were constructed, based on exclusion or
inclusion of dichotomizing variables from downstream analyses.
Thereafter, terminal branches of the classification trees were used to
classify the study population. Logistic regression was used to
compute mortality odds ratios and overall model C-statistics.
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. Because abnormal
kidney function could reflect ongoing serious illness, analyses were
repeated in which we excluded participants who died within the first
year of follow-up. As baseline assessments were performed over a
6-year period, potential duration of follow-up was shorter for later
participants; hence, analyses were repeated that truncated follow-up
at the shortest follow-up time among survivors. Findings were
similar with all strategies and are not tabulated in detail. Finally,
both logistic regression and proportional hazards regression were
used to assess mortality risk ratios, and as the findings were similar
only odds ratios with the logistic regression model were reported.
NHANES-recommended analytical procedures were followed and
the sampling weights implicit in this complex sample survey design
were used;15,26 specifically, we used WTPFSD6, SDPPSU6, and
SDPSTRA6 as weight, cluster, and stratum variables, respectively. An
alpha level o0.05 was considered statistically significant. SUDAAN, v10
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and
SAS, v9.1.3 (Cary, NC, USA) were used for data analysis.

Sensitivity, the proportion of the population who died with the risk factor; specificity, the proportion of the population who survived without the risk factor. Logistic
regression was used to calculated ORs (with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses) for death; reference groups were those without each risk factor.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-recommended analytical procedures were followed and the sampling weights implicit in this complex sample survey
design were used; WTPFSD6, SDPPSU6, and SDPSTRA6 as weight, cluster, and stratum variables, respectively.
aTrue positive is defined by death when the risk factor is present; true negative is defined by survival when the risk factor is absent. Logistic regression was used to calculated
ORs (with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses) for death; reference groups were those without each risk factor.
