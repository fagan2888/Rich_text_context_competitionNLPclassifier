Objectives. We describe how paid and unpaid home care hours received by older unmarried Americans change in
response to disability dynamics. We test whether responses to disability declines and improvements are symmetric; that is,
we test whether reductions in care hours that are due to disability improvements are of similar magnitude to increases in
care hours that are due to disability declines.
Methods. Using a national sample of older unmarried Americans, we examine changes in total hours, paid hours, and
unpaid hours of care in response to declines and improvements in personal care (activities of daily living, or ADLs) and
routine care (instrumental ADLs, or IADLs) disability. We model changes in the total hours of care received in the past
month and jointly model changes in unpaid and paid hours, using Tobit models.
Results. Changes in the total hours of care received respond to both increases and decreases in the count of ADL
limitations and appear close to symmetric. In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to be far less
symmetric: Although increases in the count of IADL limitations are met with substantial increases in the total hours of
care, decreases are not met with correspondingly large declines in care. The same general pattern is found for unpaid and
paid care, and for Medicaid-funded home care.
Discussion. Disability and care are not static constructs in old age. Older unmarried persons experience worsening,
stabilizing, and recovery of function, and their care hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs must be
cognizant of such dynamic realities.
THE cost of providing home-based long-term-care services
to older Americans with disabilities reached $37 billion in
2000, over 65% of which was paid by government programs
(Congressional Budget Office, 1999). There are also substantial
uncompensated hidden costs associated with the many hours of
``informal'' care provided primarily by family members of per-
sons with chronic disabilities (Ettner, 1996). Although married
older persons with disabilities most often rely on a spouse
to provide care (Spillman & Pezzin, 2000), those without a
spouse are subject to a more fragmented--and potentially less
stable--array of care choices.
Conservative projections suggest the number of older
persons with disabilities could exceed 12 million by the year
2030 (Congressional Budget Office, 1999). Slower growth of
potential family caregivers is also projected, in part because
of fertility declines and increasing demands from work (Wolf,
2001). Thus, despite studies suggesting recent improvements in
old-age functioning (Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002), the
anticipated growth in the sheer number of older Americans with
disabilities who require formal home care services remains
a policy concern.
In light of these demographic trends, policy makers have
shown interest in restraining the future growth in public spend-
ing for home-based care while supporting America's families.
At the federal level, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, for
example, shifted the Medicare home health benefit from a
cost-based to prospective payment system, thereby providing
incentives to contain the length of time older Americans with
disabilities receive home care services for medical conditions.
Other recent federal initiatives have aimed to expand family-
provided support through mechanisms such as tax deductions
and respite programs (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2001). States are also concerned about growth in long-
term-care expenditures under the Medicaid program, and many
have adopted cost-containment strategies to curb home care
costs (Wiener, 1997).
Related to these policy initiatives are discussions of ap-
propriate targeting of home care services to those in need (Kane,
1999). Evaluations of targeting often rely on cross-sectional
evidence comparing the characteristics of those receiving home
care services with those who do not. Such exercises ignore the
inherently dynamic underpinnings of both the disablement pro-
cess and care decisions. Here we provide additional insight into
discussions of home care service allocation by considering
the care process from a more dynamic perspective and by con-
sidering both paid and unpaid sources of care simultaneously.
In this context, effective targeting implies not only getting
people with few informal resources the services they need when
they acquire a disability, but also increasing such services for
those whose disability worsens and reducing such services for
those who improve.
The framework we develop here is unique in that it allows
us to explore whether responses to disability declines and
improvements are symmetric; that is, we test whether reductions
in response to disability improvements are of similar magnitude
to increases in response to disability declines. In doing so we
distinguish between paid and unpaid hours and between re-
sponses to changes in personal care (e.g., difficulty bathing,

dressing, or eating) and routine care (e.g., difficulty managing
money, shopping, or using the telephone). We also identify
circumstances under which services remain in place despite
improvements in functioning. Our analysis focuses on a sub-
group of older persons most likely to experience shifts in care:
those who are unmarried.
Background
Studies of paid and unpaid care for elderly persons cut across
several disciplines. Policy makers have been largely concerned
with recent increases in the utilization of paid care and in
minimizing substitution of formal for unpaid family-provided
care. To assist the medical community in targeting high-risk
patients, epidemiologists and clinical researchers have identi-
fied risk factors associated with paid care use. Demographers
have focused on the role of kin availability in constraining the
choice of living and care arrangements. Social gerontologists
have investigated family caregiving and the burdens associated
with providing care to frail older relatives. Finally, economists
have focused on the trade-offs between caregiving and work
and on the role of market factors in the demand for care.
Despite the widespread interest in personal care arrange-
ments, the literature is limited in two respects. First, most studies
focus on care arrangements at a point in time and thus provide
limited insight into the dynamic process driving changes in care
arrangements for an individual. Second, most studies focus on
the structure of care--for example, whether an older person
with a disability uses community-based or institutional care,
or whether the care is provided by an unpaid provider, paid
provider, or some combination thereof--rather than the volume
of care provided under a given the arrangement. However, the
volume of service use, both in total and by type of provider, is
probably the most crucial factor in calculating the costs of
providing care to older persons with disabilities.
Although the literature on disability trajectories is growing
(for a review see Wolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson,
1996), there are only a few studies using measures of changes
in disability to predict care use (Langa, Chernew, Kabeto, &
Katz, 2001; Miller & McFall, 1991; Miller, McFall, &
Campbell, 1994; Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991; Worobey & Angel,
1990; Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1993). These
studies show that increases in limitations in activities of daily
living (ADLs) and in instrumental ADLs (IADLs) result in
a greater tendency to live with others and to use paid care or
a ``mixed'' (paid and unpaid) care network. Studies of changes
in community-based care have also been few in number. A
study by Miller and colleagues (1994), using a national sample
of elderly persons with chronic disability, suggests that care
transitions could be quite frequent even over short periods of
time. The authors found that, over a 2-year period, sources of
care changed for at least 20% of persons initially receiving
unpaid care and for over 50% of persons initially receiving
both unpaid and paid care. Similarly, using a sample of 476
caregivers in Wisconsin, Seltzer and Li (2000) found that 36%
of women with an elderly husband or father experienced a
transition to or from a caregiving role over a 3-year period.
We know of only one past study that has included disability
changes to predict changes in home care hours. Using the first
and second waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics of the
Oldest Old (AHEAD) study, Langa and colleagues (2001) found
large increases in weekly hours of paid home care use between
1993 and 1995, and that changes in ADLs and IADLs were
positively related to these changes. However, the authors
ignored potentially important changes between the first and
second waves of AHEAD in the survey questions used to obtain
hours of care. Moreover, changes in ADLs and IADLs were
included in their model as continuous variables ranging fromÿ6
to þ6 and from ÿ5 to þ5, respectively. This specification
assumed symmetric responses; that is, increases in care hours in
response to one additional ADL limitation were assumed to be
equivalent to decreases in care hours in response to one fewer
limitation. In addition, rather than considering in a single
framework both unpaid and paid hours of care, the authors
modeled only the receipt of paid home care and included
patterns of unpaid home care as predictors of paid care, an
approach that ignores the possibility that the two may influence
one another.
Many behavioral phenomena exhibit asymmetric responses
to opposing external forces. For example, in tight labor markets
wages tend to rise, yet during recessions they may be ``sticky''
downward, failing to fall. Similarly, individual decision making
seems to exhibit asymmetric reactions to a given level of risk
attached to potential gains compared with potential losses.
There are several reasons to anticipate that the hours of care
used by older persons with disabilities will, as well, respond
differently to comparably large declines and improvements in
functional levels, other things being equal. This is particularly
likely for unpaid IADL services provided by family mem-
bers, which have substantial social and affective components.
Time-use patterns connected to shared meals, housekeeping,
or provision of transportation that are established in times of
care needs may be maintained or only partly reduced if the
care recipient recovers the capacity for self-care. If an older
parent moves in with a child in response to ADL needs, then
the coresidence may be maintained despite later recovery of
function. Coresidence, in turn, fosters the provision of IADL
assistance even if that assistance is not strictly necessary. Some
studies have also documented some degree of unpaid ADL
assistance received by older people who, according to their self-
reported accounts, do not ``need'' such help (Bootsma-van der
Wiel et al., 2001).
Regarding paid care, especially to deal with ADL needs, we
would expect third-party payers for such services to enforce
declines in service levels in response to functional improve-
ment and, accordingly, reduced levels of assessed need. How-
ever, the monitoring of changing care needs may be imperfect,
occurring at large or irregularly spaced time intervals. Discre-
tion on the part of case managers and home health aides can
also lead to situations in which clients' functioning improves
but services are not reduced (Jenkins, 1997). Thus, both un-
paid and paid care services may respond asymmetrically to
changes in the severity of disability. The responses exhibited
by each type of care may differ from each other as well. We
describe our empirical approach to these issues in the para-
graphs that follow.
METHODS
Data
We use the first three waves of the AHEAD study, conducted
by the Institute for Social Research at the University of
FREEDMAN ET AL.
S26
Michigan. The AHEAD study is a national prospective panel
survey of initially noninstitutionalized persons born in 1923 or
earlier. The purpose of the study is to provide an understanding
of the implications of health dynamics in old age for transitions
in economic well-being, for changes in family and marital
status, and for reliance on public and private support systems.
Households were selected on the basis of a multistage area
probability sample plan, with oversampling of Blacks,
Hispanics, and Florida residents. For details, see Soldo, Hurd,
Rodgers, and Wallace (1997). By the third (1998) wave of the
study, the AHEAD study was integrated with its parent project,
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
The AHEAD study is uniquely suited to examine questions
of how care arrangements are put into place over time. At each
wave (hereafter, AHEAD93, AHEAD95, and HRS98), the
AHEAD collects data on care arrangements, health status and
transitions, kin networks, familial resources, and demographic
characteristics. Although question changes preclude compar-
isons of hours of care and disability for 1993 and 1995, the
AHEAD95 and HRS98 waves obtained information on dis-
ability and hours of care provided by nonspousal helpers in an
identical fashion.
We restrict our analysis to those who were alive and un-
married at all three waves and who reported difficulty in 1995
with one or more out of six ADLs or with one or more out of
five IADLs. We exclude those living in an institution in 1995 or
1998 in order to focus our analysis on home- and community-
based care. Our final sample size consists of 746 unmarried
community-based older Americans who report difficulty with
one or more ADL or IADL activities. Sample characteristics
are provided in Table 1. To compensate for differential prob-
abilities of selection, we base estimates on weighted data.
Modeling Approach
We use the change score regression approach commonly
found in the evaluation literature (Allison, 1990). In effect, we
view changes in care needs, whether improvements or declines
and whether for ADL or IADL services, as ``treatments'' and
the associated changes in care hours as ``responses'' to them. In
order to isolate the effect of disability dynamics on changes in
the volume of care, we model changes in the hours of care
between 1995 and 1998 as a function of initial disability level
in 1995 and the change in disability between 1995 and 1998.
We first address hypotheses about the effect of disability
transitions on the total volume (measured in hours) received by
older persons with disabilities. Because we measured hours of
care in a continuous fashion by using hours of care per month,
the change in monthly hours from t ÿ 1 (1995) to t (1998)--
denoted ÁVi
tÿ1,t--was also a continuous variable, which could
take on both positive and negative values. In the population, the
distribution of changes in care hours is, in effect, unbounded.
At the individual level, however, two constraints on estimation
must be noted. For those receiving no care at t ÿ 1 (i.e., for
those with Vi
tÿ1 ¼ 0), ÁVi
tÿ1,t must be greater than or equal to
0. For individuals with Vi
tÿ1 . 0, declines cannot exceed Vi
tÿ1
(i.e., ÁVi
tÿ1,t  ÿVi
tÿ1). Such constraints manifest themselves
in the data as heaping at ÿVi
tÿ1, a problem also common to the
analysis of cross-sectional measures of hours. This problem has
been dealt with in the unpaid care literature (see, e.g., Wolf,
Freedman, & Soldo, 1997) by use of a Tobit specification.
The two constraints described reduce to a single constraint:
Changes in care hours are censored atÿV tÿ1. We therefore used
a Tobit model of changes in hours with individual-specific
censoring at ÿVi
tÿ1. Because in the population care-hours
responses are unbounded, as explained herein, the Tobit index
function produces coefficients that allow for a test of symmetry.
Symmetry exists if the effect of declines in disability on the
total hours of care is the opposite of the effect of improvements
in disability. That is, symmetry exists if the coefficient on
a variable representing a given amount of functional improve-
ment equals the negative of the coefficient on another variable
representing the same amount of functional decline. To test
for symmetry in unpaid and paid care hours, we extended the
analysis by jointly modeling changes in the number of formal

and informal hours by using a bivariate Tobit approach (Couch,
Daly, & Wolf, 1999).
Outcomes
The outcomes in this analysis--change in total hours of
care, and changes in the number of paid and unpaid hours of
care--were calculated from information about the hours of care
received in the month preceding the interview in 1995 and
in 1998. Respondents were asked to provide information
about caregivers by using three sets of questions, which were
identical in both years. The first set of questions asked about
any difficulty with ADLs (walking, bathing, dressing, eating,
transferring, or toileting), the second set asked about any
difficulty with IADLs (preparing meals, taking medicine, using
the telephone, or shopping), and the third set (considered an
IADL for our purposes) focused on difficulty with a single task:
money management.
The same general approach was taken for each of the three
sets of activities. For ADL activities, for example, respondents
were first asked whether they had any difficulty, and, if so,
whether someone helps, with each of the specific ADL items.
After completing all six ADL items, respondents reporting that
someone helps them with one or more activities were then
asked to identify caregivers who helped in the past month with
those activities for which they reported receiving help. This pro-
cess was repeated for IADL and money management activities.
After caregivers were identified for the three sets of activities,
respondents were asked, regarding each helper (but excluding
spouses and employees of nursing homes), how many days per
week each caregiver provided help in the past month, how
many hours per day that caregiver usually helped, the gender of
the caregiver, and whether the helper was paid.
To remain consistent with the monthly reference period in
the questions about hours of care, we calculated each care-
giver's hours of care in the past month by multiplying for each
helper the reported number of hours per day by the reported
number of days per week, times 52 and then divided by 12.
Summing the hours for each caregiver, we calculated the total
hours of care received in the past month. We also summed hours
provided by unpaid caregivers to yield unpaid hours in the past
month and summed hours provided by paid caregivers to yield
paid hours in the past month.
In a small number of cases, the hours of care were in-
complete or missing entirely for a respondent because of
missing information on one or more caregivers. For 42
respondents in 1995 and 31 respondents in 1998, we imputed
information on hours per day or hours of care in the past month
for one or more helpers. We assigned to caregivers with
missing information the average number of hours of care
provided by caregivers of the same type (male nonagency,
female nonagency, or agency based) in networks with the same
number of helpers (1, 2, or 3þ). For 13 respondents in 1995 and
3 respondents in 1998, we also imputed probabilistically
whether the caregiver was paid, based on the type of helper and
the size of the network.
Predictors
The main predictors of interest are changes in the disability
level of respondents. For both ADLs and IADLs, we included
categorical indicators of the change in the count of limitations
between 1995 and 1998 (e.g., increases of 1 or of 2 or more
and decreases of 1 or of 2 or more compared with an omitted
category of no change). As a further control for one's place in the
disability continuum, we also included continuous variables
indicating the number of each type of activity limitation in 1995.
Hours of care can respond to many factors besides changes
in disability: Unpaid caregivers can experience events in other
life domains that impinge on their availability; programmatic
eligibility for paid services can be achieved or exhausted; pri-
vate insurance stop-loss thresholds can be crossed; and so on.
Accordingly, in all models we included a number of variables
thought to reflect the preferences of older individuals with
disabilities and their families and shown to be related to care
hours in past studies. These covariates include age (Kemper,
1992; Miner, 1995), race and Hispanic origin (Marks, 1996;
Tennstedt & Chang, 1998), and education (Kemper, 1992). Past
studies have shown that hours received of both informal and
formal care are influenced by the number of children that
a person has, with different effects for sons and daughters
(Picone & Wilson, 1999; Wolf et al., 1997). Accordingly, the
potential supply of informal care hours was represented by a
series of variables indicating the number of sons and daughters
that respondents had. We also explored the effects of the num-
ber of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law but found no substantial
effect. Although they were available in the AHEAD study, we
omitted measures of coresidence with a child and distance to
nearest child in our models, because decisions about living
arrangements are likely to be made jointly with care arrange-
ments (Pezzin, Kemper, & Reschovsky, 1996; Pezzin & Schone,
1999). Financial resources of the respondent were classified into
low, medium, and high on the basis of 1993 income and liquid
asset quintiles for the entire AHEAD sample.
Finally, the implications of asymmetric responses for policy
makers will vary depending on the source of care. If unpaid
caregivers demonstrate ``sticky'' behavior to improvements
in health, policy makers may be less apt to intervene than if
Medicaid providers do so. We investigated the source of pay-
ment for caregivers providing such services in two ways.
Although sample sizes were too small to estimate complex
models, we descriptively examine the mean changes in hours of
care by source of payment for a caregiver (completely out of
pocket vs. insured in part or in full) and mean changes in
unpaid and paid hours for those reporting Medicaid coverage.
RESULTS
Disability and Care Hour Dynamics
Within this cohort of unmarried older Americans with ADL
or IADL limitations, average care hours increased by ap-
proximately 30 hr over the 3-year period, from 77 hr/month
in 1995 to 106 hr/month in 1998 (see Table 2). Both types of
care hours increased; they were on average 12 and 17 hr higher
in 1998 than in 1995 for unpaid and paid care, respectively.
Also consistent with much of the cross-sectional literature,
total, unpaid, and paid hours of care were generally higher at
more severe disability levels. The exception to this pattern was
found among unmarried older persons with no ADL limitations
(i.e., with IADL limitations only), a group receiving more
unpaid care hours that those with one or two ADL limitations.
FREEDMAN ET AL.
S28
The largest changes were observed for those with one or two
ADLs or with three or more IADLs at baseline.
A more dynamic perspective is provided in Table 3, in which
we present mean hours of care in 1995 and changes between
1995 and 1998 by the extent of ADL and IADL change dur-
ing the same time interval. In this and remaining tables, ``ÿ2
or more'' indicates declines of two or more in the count of
limitations (e.g., fewer activity limitations), whereas ``þ2 or
more'' indicates increases of two or more in the count of limita-
tions (e.g., more activity limitations).
The descriptive statistics in Table 3 suggest a highly
asymmetric relationship between disability and care dynamics.
Those who experienced declines of two or more in the count
of ADL limitations began on average with 81 hr of care, the
bulk of which was in unpaid hours. This group reduced their
total hours of care by only approximately 20 hr per month,
with reductions stemming from declines in unpaid hours. Con-
versely, those who experienced an increase of two or more
in the count of ADL limitations doubled their care hours from
105 hr in 1995 to over 200 hr in 1998, with the additional hours
split between paid and unpaid sources.
A similar pattern was observed with respect to IADL tasks.
In response to declines of two or more in the count of IADL
limitations, older unmarried persons decreased their care hours
by only 19 hr a month from approximately 143 hr in 1995 to
123 hr in 1998. The decline in care was the result of a trade-off
between unpaid and paid care hours, with unpaid care hours
declining by nearly one third and paid care hours increasing by
16 hr per month. Increases of two or more in the count of IADL
limitations were met with substantial increases in total hours,
tripling from 74 hr in 1995 to nearly 220 hr in 1998. The bulk
of the additional hours came from unpaid sources (86 additional
unpaid vs. 58 additional paid hours).
We also find asymmetric care dynamics when we restrict the
analysis to those reporting Medicaid coverage. As shown in
Table 4, although sample sizes are small for some cells, hours
provided by paid caregivers increase dramatically in response
to increases of two or more in the count of IADL limitations
(þ168 hr) but do not change appreciably in response to declines
in the count of IADL limitations.
Are responses of total hours of care to ADL and IADL
dynamics symmetric?--In the first few columns of Table 5,
we present the effects of ADL and IADL disability changes
on changes in total hours of care between 1995 and 1998,
controlling for preferences, resources, opportunities for care,
and baseline ADL and IADL disability. We also present tests of
symmetry; that is, we compare the coefficients, for example, for
``þ2 or more ADLs'' and ``ÿ2 or more ADLs.'' Statistically
significant departures from the null hypothesis of bÁD
¼ÿbÿÁD
indicate asymmetric responses. (For other model coefficients,
see the first column of Table 6.)
Change in total care hours respond to both increases and
decreases in the count of ADL limitations. For those persons
experiencing large disability changes (e.g., increases or
decreases of two or more in the count of ADL limitations),
responses appear close to symmetric (e.g., b ¼ÿ113 for those
experiencing declines in the count and b ¼ 87 for those experi-

encing increases). Formal tests indicate that the null hypothesis
of symmetry cannot be rejected at even the p , .10 level.
In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to
be far less symmetric. Although increases in the count of IADL
limitations lead to substantial increases in the total hours of care
(e.g., b ¼ 261 for ``þ2 or more''), comparable decreases in
the count are not followed by correspondingly large declines
in hours (e.g., b ¼ ÿ67 for ``ÿ2 or more''). In other words,
responses to declines in IADL functioning are nearly 3 times
the volume of responses to improvements (p , .05 for test of
symmetry).
Are unpaid and paid care responses symmetric?--In the last
two columns of Table 5, we present coefficients on changes in
ADL and IADL limitations from the bivariate Tobit models,
in which changes in hours of unpaid and paid care are
jointly estimated. Remaining coefficients are presented in the
last two columns of Table 6. We find that unpaid care
hours demonstrate a similar pattern to total care hours. That is,
unpaid care hours appear to respond more to declines than to
increases in the count of ADL limitations, but we cannot reject
a formal test of symmetry even at p , .10. However, unpaid
hours have an asymmetric response to a change of one in the
count of IADLs. Paid hours display the same general pattern
of symmetry with respect to ADL disability dynamics, but
responses to IADL dynamics appear asymmetric. In particular,
paid care hours increase with an increase of two or more in the
count of IADL limitations but do not decline in response to
declines of two or more in the count. Because of the small
numbers of cases experiencing declines of two or more in the
count of IADL limitations, statistical tests fail to reject the null
hypothesis of symmetry.
DISCUSSION
We have provided a dynamic perspective on the hours of
care provided to older unmarried persons with disabilities who
live in the community. We found, like Spillman and Pezzin
(2000), Langa and colleagues (2001), and others, that both paid
and unpaid care hours received by older unmarried Americans
with disabilities increased during the 1990s. Unlike previous
analyses, however, we find that for this population, care hours
respond in different ways to shifts in ADL and IADL disability.
Responses to ADL dynamics are relatively symmetric--
increasing as disability worsens and decreasing as recovery
ensues. In contrast, responses to IADL needs appear to be
asymmetric. Unpaid care hours respond to both increases and
decrease in the number of IADL limitations, but more so to the
former than the latter. Paid care hours increase in response to
declines in IADL functioning but do not decrease in response to
IADL improvements. That is, once a paid arrangement has been
put into place to meet the need for preparing meals, taking
medicine, using the telephone, shopping, or managing money,
the care remains in place despite improvements in ability.
Our study is limited in three important respects. First, the
measure of disability dynamics we adopted has some inherent
disadvantages. Perhaps most important, the measure does not
capture improvements or declines in difficulty with specific
activities, thus raising the possibility that asymmetric responses
simply reflect declines and improvements in fundamentally
different areas of functioning. We investigated whether declines
in IADL functioning were more likely than improvements in
IADL functioning to involve time-consuming activities (e.g.,
shopping) and found that this is not the case. We also found
few statistically significant relationships between changes in
difficulty with specific activities and in hours of care received.
We therefore represented disability trajectories with changes in
the number of activity limitations. Our measure of disability
also does not capture changes in the degree of difficulty with
a given activity over time. Indeed, answers to questions about
difficulty may in part reflect getting help, because older un-
married persons were not instructed whether to consider help
or equipment when answering questions about having difficulty
with a given activity. At least one study suggests, however, that
the questions used to elicit information about personal care are
a reasonable indication of underlying difficulty without help or
special equipment, if used (Freedman, 2000).
Second, because of data limitations, our analysis could not
address how married older persons balance paid and unpaid
care over time. Other studies suggest married older persons are
less likely to use paid home care (Katz, Kabeto, & Langa, 2000;

Langa et al., 2001), and that the spouse is first in line to serve
as primary caregiver (Spillman & Pezzin, 2000) and seldom
withdraws from this role (Jette, Tennstedt, & Branch, 1992).
Certainly, a separate analysis of this group is warranted should
the appropriate data become available. Until that time, it
remains unclear how married older persons handle declines in
health and what, if any, the repercussions are for joint care
decisions.
Third, we were unable to control for the changing policy and
price regimes for home care that occurred during this period.
The paid home care hours recorded in our data reflect services
provided by a variety of programs, including Medicaid-funded
home health and personal care services, personal care covered
through Medicare's home health benefit, and services re-
imbursed by private insurance and those paid out of pocket.
These different programs are subject to very different supply,
reimbursement, and regulatory provisions that may have
changed during the 1995­1998 period. Expenditures for the
Medicare home health benefit, for example, which represent an
unknown proportion of the paid services in our data, increased
by the order of 30% per year from 1995 through 1997 but then
experienced contractions of approximately the same magnitude
in 1998 (Government Accounting Office, 2000). The contrac-
tions have been attributed in part to the implementation of the
Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997, which began the shift in
Medicare's home health benefit from a cost-basis benefit to
a prospective payment system. Given that our data span from
1995 to 1998, only 1 year after passage of the amendment and
hence only months into implementation of the transitional
interim payment scheme, our estimates are likely to reflect more
of the former regime than the current prospective payment
system. Certainly, a further evaluation of the consequences of
implementation of a Medicare home health prospective pay-
ment for the hours and balance of care of older Americans with
disabilities deserves attention.
The asymmetries in home care dynamics revealed by our
analysis have both research and programmatic implications.
Cross-sectional multivariate analyses of variations in the inten-
sity of home care generally exhibit relatively low explanatory
power. Our results suggest that part of the unexplained varia-
tion in home care usage results not from omitted current-period
variables but from omitted prior-period variables, in particular
variables describing the past trajectory of disability and of re-
sponses to it. In addition, to the extent that current-period varia-
tions in service use reflect prior-period variations in disability
severity and service use, issues related to equity in the allocation
of services are raised.
Our results neither address the question of appropriateness
of service levels, either before or after a change in disability
severity, nor suggest that individuals are receiving more or
fewer of the formal services for which they might be eligible
through publicly funded programs. However, asymmetric
responses to changes in disability severity imply the existence
of cross-sectional differences in service use that are unrelated to
current circumstances. Our results suggest the possibility that
some older persons with disabilities may be receiving differ-
ent levels of publicly and privately funded home care services,
particularly for routine care tasks such as shopping and house-
keeping, for reasons unrelated to their current needs; this is a
suggestion worth addressing in future research.
Our findings of asymmetry in changes in paid service use
might be linked to programmatic intervals for assessing clients'
functioning. During the period covered by the data analyzed
herein, Medicare home health practices (which cover personal

DISABILITY AND HOME CARE DYNAMICS S31
care only if a beneficiary also is homebound and requires
skilled nursing on an intermittent basis), Medicaid regulations,
and private insurance rules varied widely. According to a study
of 72 Medicaid home care programs (Congressional Research
Service, 1993), for example, 40% of existing programs required
reassessments on an annual basis and another 50% once every
6 months, and the remaining 10% less frequently. In contrast,
Medicare's home health prospective payment system requires,
beginning in October 2000, a minimum of 60 days between
evaluations. The dynamic framework adopted in this study
could be used to explore optimal review intervals for public and
private programs alike.
And what of the unpaid caregiver, most often the daughter,
who continues to provide care with shopping, cooking, and
cleaning after her parent's difficulties have eased? Although
horizontal equity is not of programmatic concern here, why
such behavior is occurring is an interesting question for future
research. We can suggest several possibilities for further
exploration. Perhaps permanent changes to work schedules
made in anticipation of a long parental illness may free up
a caregiver's time to continue routine care activities. Perhaps
caregivers enjoy the nonmonetary rewards of participating
in intergenerational transfers, or perhaps they are helping in
anticipation of future monetary rewards or in response to
past transfers (Henretta, Hill, Soldo, & Wolf, 1997; Walker,
Martin, & Jones, 1992). It may be that continued coresidence of
caregiver and care recipient fosters this helping behavior. In our
sample, coresidence occurred in roughly 30% of cases; others
have noted the complex interrelationships of care and living
arrangement decisions (Pezzin & Schone, 1999; Pezzin et al.,
1996). Finally, public incentives (e.g., tax credits or deductions
for family caregivers) may also play some role (Gerald, 1993).
Finally, our analysis underscores the point that disability and
care are not static constructs in old age. Older persons who ex-
perience disability worsen, stabilize, and recover, and their care
hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs
must be cognizant of such dynamic realities. Moreover, although
equitable service allocations are difficult to achieve and maintain
in the presence of substantial heterogeneity in disability
trajectories, home care programs and policies have to be built
around the premise that old-age disability is a dynamic construct
if policy makers are to take aim at such a goal.
