The aim of this study was to examine the influences of age, gender, cognitive abilities, and personality styles on
odor identification. Participants (N  532) aged 45­87 years from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging
were assessed with a Swedish version of the National Geographic Smell Survey. Both detection and identification
of olfactory information were impaired with age. Gender had no effect on detection or identification. Hierarchi-
cal regressions revealed that proficiency in semantic memory, intensity perception, and personality style (i.e.,
neuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness) were potent predictors for successful odor identification, even
when individual variations in chronological age, sex, education, and global cognitive functioning were taken into
account.
GING is often accompanied by impairments in various
sensory and cognitive aspects of olfactory functioning.
Older adults exhibit a lower sensitivity for odors, as re-
flected in absolute threshold measurements (e.g., Cain &
Gent, 1991; Murphy, Nunez, Withee, & Jalowayski, 1985)
and in intensity measures of suprathreshold odors (Stevens
& Cain, 1985). Likewise, older adults' recognition memory
for odors is poorer than that observed in young adults (Lars-
son & Bäckman, 1993; Murphy, Cain, Gilmore, & Skinner,
1991), as is their ability to name or identify olfactory infor-
mation. The latter is true for both free identification mea-
sures (Schemper, Voss, & Cain, 1981) and tasks where mul-
tiple choices of possible odor names are available (Doty et
al., 1984).
An important research issue has been to establish whether
increased sensory problems, cognitive changes, or both
cause the observed age-related deficits in odor recognition
memory and odor identification. Recent research suggests
that age-related deficits in both odor recognition and odor
identification may be largely attributable to cognitive limi-
tations (Larsson & Bäckman, 1997; Murphy et al., 1991).
For example, there is evidence that episodic odor memories
are mediated by semantic factors (e.g., familiarity and odor
identification) and that older adults' difficulties in identify-
ing common olfactory information underlie the aging-related
deficits in odor memory (Larsson & Bäckman, 1993, 1997;
Lehrner, Glück, & Laska, 1999).
Given that age deficits in odor naming are highly preva-
lent and that they also mediate age-related impairments in
episodic odor memory, it is of interest to consider potential
explanations for older adults' problems in identifying odors.
Of particular interest is to examine the relationship between
aging-related deficits in odor identification and perfor-
mance in other aspects of cognitive functioning. By defini-
tion, odor identification is a semantic memory task, in that it
refers to an individual's general knowledge or experience
with a specific odorant (Schab, 1991; Tulving, 1993). It is
therefore of interest to examine whether proficiency in odor
identification relates to performance in other tasks that tap
semantic memory (e.g., vocabulary and information). Of
further interest is to determine whether odor identification is
related to performance in other cognitive domains, such as
performance in short-term memory, episodic memory, and
visuospatial functioning. Finding reliable relationships be-
tween measures of semantic memory and odor identification,
and nonsignificant relationships between measures of other
cognitive functions and odor identification, would strengthen
the hypothesis that complex verbal intellectual abilities and
odor identification tap the same cognitive domain.
In addition to cognitive variables, research suggests a
possible role for personality measures in the prediction of
odor performance. Perceptual abilities are associated with
certain personality traits such as extraversion (Stelmack &
Michaud-Achorn, 1985). Little is known as to whether vari-
ous personality styles influence olfactory functions, and the
sparse evidence presents a mixed pattern of results. In an
early study, Koelega (1970) reported that participants who
scored high in extraversion also exhibited a higher olfactory
sensitivity, whereas neuroticism was unrelated to odor per-
ception. In a related study, which focused on subjective ex-
periences (i.e., intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity) of
olfactory information, no relationship between perceptual
experience and degree of extraversion was found (Filsinger,
Fabes, & Hughston, 1987). In contrast, Pause, Ferstl, and
Fehm-Wolfsdorf (1998) reported that neuroticism was a
stronger predictor for olfactory sensitivity than was extra-
version. This latter finding is in congruence with research
focused on emotional (personal) styles and olfactory sensi-

tivity. Olfactory sensitivity for octanol was examined in
high- and low-anxiety women, and the results showed that
highly anxious women had reliably higher thresholds than
did women low in anxiety (Rovee, Harris, & Yopp, 1973).
In a similar vein, Herbener, Kagan, and Cohen (1989) re-
ported that level of shyness (introversion) was related to
odor thresholds; participants high in shyness had lower ol-
factory thresholds for butanol than participants with low
shyness scores.
A number of studies have indicated that women perform
better in olfactory tasks than do men and that the general fe-
male superiority is valid throughout the human adult life
span (e.g., Dorries, 1992; Doty et al., 1984; Ship & Weif-
fenbach, 1993). However, Ship, Pearson, Cruise, Brant, and
Metter (1996) found that men might show a more precipi-
tous and earlier decline in smell identification than do
women, implicating an age by gender interaction in olfac-
tory performance. It is still unknown why women show this
superiority, but gender-related differences in factors such
as hormones (estrogens, progesterone), environmental back-
ground, and verbal fluency might play a role. Two of our pur-
poses in the present study were to examine further whether
women perform better than men in the second half of the life
span and also to investigate the possibility of age by gender
interactions in odor detection and odor identification.
In the present study we assessed a subsample of 532 par-
ticipants from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging
(SATSA; Pedersen et al., 1991) with a Swedish version of
the National Geographic Smell Survey (Wysocki & Gilbert,
1989) with a particular focus on odor detection and odor
identification abilities. All participants were also provided
with a series of questionnaires concerning health, personal-
ity, and lifestyle variables (e.g., smoking behavior) and
were also tested across a number of cognitive domains.
On the basis of these data, we examined: (a) the influence
of age and gender on odor detection and odor identification,
(b) the relationship between odor identification ability and
performance in various cognitive tasks, (c) the influence of
personality on olfactory functioning and (d) the relative pre-
dictive value of individual differences in demographic, cog-
nitive, perceptual, and personality variables on odor identi-
fication.
METHODS
Participants
As noted, the sample was a subset of twins from the pop-
ulation-based Swedish Twin Registry (Cederlöf & Lorich,
1978). The SATSA study (Pedersen et al., 1991) included
both questionnaire and in-person testing assessments (in-
person assessments also included a questionnaire). In the
current analyses, we used data collected during the third
wave of questionnaires (in 1990) and the second wave of in-
person testing (1989­91). The in-person testing took place
in a location convenient to the participants, such as district
nurses' offices, health care schools, and long-term care clin-
ics. The testing session also incorporated a health examina-
tion, and the visit lasted approximately 4 h.
The smell survey was mailed with the 1990 questionnaire
to the subset of 606 participants who had completed the first
wave of in-person testing (1986­88), and 532 (87.8%) com-
pleted surveys were returned. Because olfactory abilities are
known to be severely affected by dementia (e.g., Larsson et
al., 1999; Mesholam, Moberg, Mahr, & Doty, 1998), partic-
ipants suffering from Alzheimer's disease, vascular demen-
tia, or unspecified dementia were excluded (n  26). Thus,
the remaining sample involved 506 adults, ranging in age
from 45 to 87 years (M  65.4, SD  8.5), 57% of whom
were female. Characteristics of the sample are provided in
Table 1. Education was rated on a 4-point scale (1  com-
pletion of elementary school, 2  completion of vocational
high school, 3  "gymnasium" or academic high school, 4 
university studies or higher). To assess global level of cog-
nitive functioning and screen for severe cognitive im-
pairment, all participants completed the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975).
We used the SUMILL scale, which surveys the number of
organ systems reported to be affected by a chronic health
problem, to measure general health. The scale incorporates
measures of 13 organ systems, including cardiovascular,
respiratory, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system
disorders. An individual's score is the summed total of or-
gan systems reported to be affected by at least one chronic
health problem (Harris, Pedersen, McClearn, Plomin, &
Nesselroade, 1992). SUMILL ranged from 0 to 9 in this
sample with an average value of about 3. Use of cigarettes,
cigars, and pipes was included in the calculation of pack-
years (Kendler, Karkowski, & Pedersen, in press). Cigar
and pipe tobacco consumptions were converted to cigarette
equivalents (e.g., one cigar was equivalent to four cigarettes).
Measures
Olfactory test.--We used a Swedish version of the Na-
tional Geographic Smell Survey to evaluate olfaction. The
original smell survey was inserted into each copy of the
September 1986 issue of National Geographic magazine,
and 1.42 million respondents were registered. The precise
methods, technical features (e.g., odor concentrations and
complete questionnaire), and data from the respondents are
available elsewhere (Corwin, Loury, & Gilbert, 1995; Rus-
sell et al., 1993; Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989). In the Swedish
version, a translation of the questions was attached to the
original National Geographic scratch-and-sniff forms.

The smell survey comprised six scratch-and-sniff mi-
croencapsulated odorants: androstenone, amyl acetate, Gal-
axolideTM, eugenol, mercaptans, and rose. Two of these
odorants are food related: amyl acetate, which has a banana-
or pear-like fruity odor, and eugenol, a major constituent of
clove oil. Mercaptans is a highly unpleasant sulfurous com-
pound that is added to natural gas as a warning odor. Syn-
thetic rose is a pleasant, familiar non food odor. Galax-
olideTM is a widely used synthetic musk that is often added
to perfumes. Finally, the compound androstenone is a vola-
tile steroid metabolite produced by many mammals, includ-
ing humans. Men produce more androstenone than women
do, but the compound may be extracted from the urine and
sweat of both sexes.
Respondents were asked to scratch and sniff each odor
panel and to answer a number of questions, including: "Did
you smell something (yes or no)?" "Did it smell good or bad
(1  very unpleasant, 5  very pleasant)?" "How intense is
this odor (1  very weak, 5  very strong)?" For odor iden-
tification, respondents were instructed to select one of the
following alternatives: floral, musky, urine, foul, ink, spicy,
woody, fruity, burnt, sweet, other (if other: What?). Survey
designers chose the descriptors to provide generic, nonover-
lapping designations of odor quality (Russell et al., 1993;
Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989). In the present study, we used the
standards provided by Wysocki and Gilbert (1989) to score
odor identification. If a respondent provided a veridical la-
bel of the odor, the response was counted as correct. Also, if
a respondent chose a near-miss label such as banana candy
for amyl acetate, it was coded as correct. If a respondent de-
tected an odorant but was unable to identify it, then the
identification response was scored incorrect.
For the analyses, data were summarized across odorants
and four measures were obtained: number of odorants de-
tected (odor detection), number of odorants correctly identi-
fied (odor identification), mean pleasantness rating, and
mean intensity rating.
Cognitive measures.--The cognitive battery in SATSA
was selected to provide representation of both the domains
of fluid (figure logic, Koh's block design, card rotations)
and crystallized (information, synonyms, analogies, Thur-
stone's memory) intelligence (Horn, 1982). In addition, the
battery included measures tapping specific cognitive do-
mains such as short-term memory (digit span forward and
backward), perceptual speed (digit symbol, figure identifi-
cation), and episodic memory (names and faces). A more
detailed description of the cognitive tests included in
SATSA is available in Pedersen, Plomin, Nesselroade, and
McClearn (1992).
Personality tests.--Five scales taken from different per-
sonality inventories were used in the SATSA battery: extra-
version, neuroticism, lack of assertiveness, impulsivity, and
openness to experience. The personality traits extraversion
and neuroticism were measured with a short form of the
Eysenck Personality Inventory (Floderus, 1974). Each scale
score is based on the sum of 0 (no) and 1 (yes) responses to
nine items. Two subscales from the Karolinska Scales of
Personality were also included in the SATSA battery: the
Lack of Assertiveness scale and the Impulsivity scale
(Schalling, 1986; Schalling, Edman, & Åsberg, 1983). The
Lack of Assertiveness scale is composed of 10 items (e.g.,
"If I'm treated badly at a restaurant I don't like to complain"
and "When someone teases me I can never think of a good
answer until afterwards"). The Impulsivity scale score con-
sists of the sum of responses to each of 10 items on a
5-point Likert scale. The impulsivity items mainly reflect
acting on the spur of the moment and rapid decision making
(e.g., "I often rush into new things" or "When I make deci-
sions I usually do it quickly"). Finally, a shortened version
of the Openness to Experience scale (25 of the original 48
items) from the NEO Personality Inventory was used (Costa
& McCrae, 1985; Leong & Dollinger, 1990). The Openness
domain taps proactive seeking and appreciation of experi-
ence for its own sake, on the basis of characteristics such as
openness to feelings, new ideas, flexibility of thought, and
readiness to indulge in fantasy (McCrae & Costa, 1985).
RESULTS
Age and Olfactory Performance
For the analyses of overall age and gender effects on odor
detection and odor identification, the sample was divided
into two age groups: young-old adults (M  58.6, SD  5.3,
range 45­65 years) and old adults (M  72.8, SD  4.8,
range 66­87 years). The total number of odors detected and
the total number of correct identifications for each individ-
ual were analyzed with separate 2 (Age: young-old, old) 
2 (Gender: male, female) analyses of variance.
The older age group detected fewer of the odorants,
F(1,501)  3.64, p  .05, and gender had no effect on odor
detection (p  .40). The interaction between age and gender
was not significant (F  1). The oldest participants identi-
fied fewer of the odorants correctly, F(1,499)  9.78, p 
.005, and men and women did not differ in identification
performance (p  .10). The interaction between age and
gender also was not significant (F  1).
Separate correlations between age and odor detection for
each odor, with gender and pack-years partialed out, indi-
cated that increasing age was associated with an impaired
ability to detect mercaptans (r  .10, p  .05) and Galax-
olideTM (r  .11, p  .01). No other correlations were sig-
nificant. There were two significant correlations between
age and odor identification across odor stimuli, suggesting
that aging may be associated with a better ability to identify
the smell of amyl acetate (r  .10, p  .05) and lesser abil-
ity to identify mercaptans or gas (r  .24, p  .001).
Diseases and Olfactory Performance
To investigate the relationship between a number of dis-
eases and performance in the olfactory tasks, we performed
a series of correlations with age, sex, and pack-years par-
tialed out. The general health measure--SUMILL--was un-
related to both odor detection and odor identification. Sepa-
rate analyses for a number of diseases (i.e., central nervous
system (CNS) disorders, diabetes, epilepsy, metabolic dis-
orders, respiratory disorders, and stroke) revealed that only
CNS disorders were reliably related to impairments in odor
detection ( p  .05) and that epilepsy was associated with an
INFLUENCES ON ODOR IDENTIFICATION P307
impaired ability to identify olfactory information (p  .05),
which is consistent with earlier observations (Savic, Book-
heimer, Fried, & Engel, 1997).
Cognitive Functioning and Olfactory Performance
The relationships between performance in the cognitive
measures and the olfactory tasks, partialed by pack-years,
are displayed in Table 2. None of the cognitive tests were
related to odor detection performance. However, odor iden-
tification was reliably and positively related to performance
in tasks tapping crystallized intelligence and semantic mem-
ory functions (i.e., analogies, synonyms, information, Thur-
stone's memory), and one measure of perceptual speed (i.e.,
digit symbol). No significant relationships were observed
for any of the measures of fluid intelligence, short-term
memory, and episodic memory.
Personality and Olfactory Performance
Partial correlations between odor detection and odor
identification and the various personality measures are dis-
played in Table 3. The correlations, corrected for pack-
years, indicated that none of the personality measures were
significantly related to odor detection. However, odor iden-
tification was reliably and negatively associated with impul-
sivity, suggesting that individuals high in impulsivity score
lower in odor identification (p  .001). Also, the personal-
ity scale measuring lack of assertiveness showed a negative
association with odor identification (p  .001), implying
that individuals with a greater lack of assertiveness also per-
form more poorly in odor identification. Individuals with high
scores in the openness to experience domain identified more
odors than did individuals low in openness to experience, as
reflected by a significant positive relationship (p  .01).
Predictors of Odor Identification
To examine the influence of individual differences in the
demographic, cognitive, perceptual, and personality vari-
ables on odor identification, we conducted a hierarchical re-
gression analysis. Only those variables that were signifi-
cantly correlated (p  .01) with the dependent measure at
the zero-order level were entered in the analysis. Also, we
wanted to explore the relative importance of hedonic value
and perceived intensity for successful odor identification.
The predictor variables were entered in the following order:
age, sex, education, MMSE, semantic memory, hedonics,
perceived intensity, and personality. In this way we could
determine whether semantic memory proficiency, percep-
tual experience, and personality style still made a significant
contribution to odor identification, even with individual
variation in demographic variables and MMSE scores taken
into account. The semantic memory variables and the per-
sonality scales were entered as two separate blocks in the
regression. Table 4 depicts the hierarchical regression for
odor identification.
As can be seen in Table 4, the independent variables ac-
counted for 13% of the variance in odor identification. Of
the eight variables, four made a significant contribution to
performance in the criterion task: age, semantic memory
proficiency, perceived intensity, and personality.
The shared variance between odor identification and the
semantic memory measures suggests that these measures
tap the same cognitive domain. Also, all beta weights, ex-
cept the one for synonyms, were positive, indicating that
higher proficiency in semantic memory tasks was related to
better performance in odor identification.
Perceived pleasantness of an odorant was unrelated to
identification, whereas the degree of perceived intensity
was strongly and positively related to identification perfor-
mance (R2  .03). Interestingly, personality traits contrib-
uted significantly to the variance (R2  .04) despite the pre-
vious inclusion of demographic and cognitive variables.
Neuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness were reli-
able predictors for odor identification, whereas extraversion
and openness to experience were not.
DISCUSSION
Our purpose in this work was to further the understanding
of the nature of age-related deficits in odor identification. In
agreement with prior evidence, the results indicate substan-
tial age-related impairments in both odor detection and odor
identification (e.g., Cain et al., 1995; Schiffman, 1997). An
important finding is the reliable positive relationship be-
tween general semantic knowledge and proficiency in odor
identification. The observation that performance in fluid in-
telligence, short-term memory, and episodic memory was
unrelated to odor identification provides a strengthening of
the view that odor identification and semantic memory pro-
ficiency in general tap the same cognitive domain (Larsson,
1997). This finding is highlighted by the fact that semantic
memory proficiency still remained a significant predictor
for odor identification performance, despite statistical con-
trol for the effects of chronological age, sex, education, and

global cognitive functioning (according to the MMSE).
These outcomes indicate the pivotal role played by semantic
memory aptitude for successful odor identification. Also,
none of the cognitive measures were related to proficiency
in odor detection, suggesting that the two olfactory tasks
measure two separate entities.
In contrast to earlier findings of gender differences in ol-
factory sensitivity and identification (e.g., Barber, 1997;
Doty et al., 1984; Lehrner, 1993), our results reveal no reli-
able influence of gender on the two olfactory measures, al-
though women were slightly better at odor identification.
Furthermore, contrary to the findings reported by Ship and
colleagues (1996), we did not find any evidence of age by
gender interactions in odor detection or odor identification
abilities. However, the observations by Ship were based on
longitudinal data, whereas our findings were cross-sec-
tional, making it impossible to disentangle true aging effects
from cohort membership.
One factor that has been proven to influence olfactory
functioning is health status (Schiffman, 1992). Our results
suggest that general health, as measured by SUMILL, is un-
related to both olfactory measures. However, separate anal-
yses for the different diseases showed that CNS disorders
affected odor detection negatively and that participants suf-
fering from epilepsy exhibited greater difficulties in identi-
fying the odorants, in accordance with a number of earlier
reports (e.g., Doty, 1991; Savic et al., 1997). A related ques-
tion that needs to be further explored in future research con-
cerns pharmaceutical use and its potential impact on olfac-
tory functioning.
Age deficits in olfactory abilities were not uniform across
odorants. Available knowledge on heterogeneous age ef-
fects for different odors is sparse. However, Wysocki and
Gilbert (1989) reported that the shape of the age-response
curve in both odor detection and identification varied across
different odorants. Our data suggest that the ability to iden-
tify amyl acetate improves with age; however, this finding
is in contrast with earlier evidence (Wysocki & Gilbert,
1989), and additional work is needed to clarify the validity
of this finding. Nevertheless, replicating earlier findings, we
found evidence that age takes a particular toll in the ability
both to detect and to identify the smell of mercaptans, the
warning agent in natural gas (Cain, Gent, & Cometto-Muniz,
1993; Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989). This is in congruence with
recent neurological data showing that brain responses for
natural gas odor, as measured by olfactory event-related po-
tentials, change across the life span. Specifically, older
adults display lower N1/P2 amplitudes, which suggest a di-
minished sensitivity, and increased P3 latencies, which sug-
gest a slower cognitive processing for gas odor (Madowitz
& Geisler, 1998). Failure to perceive and to identify the
smell of mercaptans may be a potential public safety prob-
lem, and the present data indicate that older householders
are selectively affected.
As noted earlier, not much is known concerning relation-
ships between personality factors and olfactory abilities
(Pause et al., 1998). Surprisingly, odor identification perfor-
mance was associated with personality dimensions such as
neuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness. Control-
ling for individual variation in demographic and cognitive
abilities did not negate the impact of these personality fac-
tors on odor identification.
Participants with high scores in neuroticism (emotional-
ity) also identified more odors correctly. Olfactory neuroim-
aging research has revealed that olfactory information pro-
cessing relies heavily on neuroanatomical structures within
the limbic system, such as the amygdala, enthorinal cortex,
and insula (Levy et al., 1997; Zald, Donndelinger, & Pardo,
1998). In a similar vein, it has been proposed that emotion-
ally highly reactive individuals show a higher activation
within the limbic system and that anxious individuals show
higher reactivity of the Behavioral Inhibition System, which
relates to limbic structures (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985;
Gray, 1990). Given the strong dependency between limbic
structures and olfactory functions, it is not surprising that
individuals high in emotional reactivity also would excel in
olfactory ability (Pause et al., 1998).
The predictive power of personality styles such as impul-
sivity and lack of assertiveness on odor identification are in-
triguing. Both dimensions were negatively related to odor
identification. More impulsive individuals may be more
negligent in the task situation, whereas persons exhibiting
lack of assertiveness may be indecisive in answering, which
ultimately may affect their level of performance. However,
full understanding of these findings remains unclear and
needs further exploration.
The strong influence of intensity perception on odor iden-
tification (Stevens & Cain, 1985) is of note. Perceived in-
tensity played a major role in predicting odor naming, even
when age-related variation was accounted for. This outcome
suggests that individual variation in intensity perception is a
major constituent for successful odor identification and
should be taken into account in studies evaluating profi-
ciency in odor identification.
In summary, this work has replicated and extended the
understanding of age-related deficits in odor identification.
In agreement with earlier findings, the present results indi-
cate an age-related deterioration in both odor detection and

odor identification. However, in contrast to odor identifica-
tion, odor detection was unrelated to cognitive parameters
and personality traits. Four potent factors for successful
odor identification were identified: age, semantic memory
aptitude, intensity perception, and personality style. The
fact that proficiency in odor identification was unrelated to
fluid intelligence, short-term memory, and episodic memory
strengthens the notion that semantic memory (i.e., crystal-
lized intelligence) and odor identification tap the same cog-
nitive domain.
