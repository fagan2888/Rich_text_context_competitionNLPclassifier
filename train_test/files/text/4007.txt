Abstract
Limited research exists around the interrelationships between protest camps and marketing
practices. In this article, we focus on the 2014 Hong Kong protest camps as a context where
artistic work was innovatively developed and imaginatively promoted to draw global attention.
Collecting and analysing empirical data from the Umbrella Movement, our findings explore the
interrelationships between arts marketing technologies and the creativity and artistic expression of
the protest camps so as to inform, update and rethink arts marketing theory itself. We discuss how
protesters used public space to employ inventive methods of audience engagement, participation
and co-creation of artwork, together with media art projects which aimed not only to promote
their collective aims but also to educate and inform citizens. While some studies have already
examined the function of arts marketing beyond traditional and established artistic institutions, our
findings offer novel insights into the promotional techniques of protest art within the occupied
space of a social movement. Finally, we suggest avenues for future research around the artwork of
social movements that could highlight creative and political aspects of (arts) marketing theory.

Introduction
From Tiananmen to Tahrir Square and from the Indignados movement to the Red Shirts in
Thailand, historically, protest camps have emerged as contexts of social movements' activism and
as spaces where people's opinions and demands are publicly heard. The outbreak of the 2007/2008
global financial crisis, followed by the economic recession and increased social inequality, has
caused a rise in the number of protest camps globally (Price and Sabido, 2014) and more recently,
social unrest and protests followed the 2016 US Presidential elections and Brexit vote. Phenomena
related to protests and protest camps have been examined in some fields, for example, sociology,
politics, media and communication (Feigenbaum et al., 2014; Johnson and Suliman, 2014). In
particular, social movement theorists have offered critical insights on the role of art in the context
of contentious politics as a means of communication, mobilization and collective expression to
accomplish political aims (Adams, 2002; McDonald, 2006). Surprisingly, there is very limited
research on the interface between artistic activities in protest camps and marketing theory.
Higgins and Tadajewski (2002) theoretically explored the utilization of marketing technol-
ogies and knowledge in anti-corporate protests, as vehicles for spreading political ideas and
discovering new audiences. They called for a more thorough exploration of how social
movements communicate their opinions and messages, by re-engaging with marketing theory
(Higgins and Tadajewski, 2002). Despite this call, the presence of marketing practices within
protest camps (e.g. promotion of protest art and distribution networks for collective claims and
messages) has remained unexplored in the field of marketing studies and arts marketing in
particular. While there is robust literature on the production of anti-war art (Monteith, 2008),
protest music (Rosenthal and Flacks, 2012) and activist art projects (Waltz, 2005) in several
contexts, the marketing technologies and practices utilized for their communication
and promotion are also absent from arts marketing theory. Considering the rise in frequency,
visibility and creativity of protests and social movements over the last 40 years (Jasper, 1997;
Johnson and Suliman, 2014), we suggest that marketing and arts marketing researchers could
learn from the promotional methods of protest art.
This study provides a novel exploration of how a social movement employed promotional
techniques of protest art to effectively communicate their aims and messages to the wider public.
Although our existing knowledge of arts marketing theory and practice has been heavily enriched
over the last three decades (O'Reilly, 2011), some distinctive features of protest art related to its
production, collective creativity, promotion and aesthetic consumption ­ among others ­ have been
entirely unexplored. Diverse forms of visual, performing and fine art can be produced, shared and
marketed in order to satisfy the spiritual, utilitarian or hedonic needs of the artist(s), consumer(s)
and even global audiences (Fillis, 2011). On the other hand, social movements' protest art is
(usually) collaboratively produced, ephemeral, portable and non-copyrighted, seeking to effec-
tively convey messages and symbols that will engage the public, attract media attention and stir
action. In general, the production of art aims to explore the human condition and its display can
increase aesthetic satisfaction, arouse feelings and frequently secure monetary advantages. Protest
art adopts a shared and public character and its promotion primarily aims to raise awareness of
social injustice and expose power relationships. Considering these differences, we argue that
insightful and original findings can emerge from an empirical exploration of social movements'
protest art via the lens of arts marketing theory.
In this study, our main research objective is to examine and critically discuss how marketing
technologies engaged with the promotion of protest art during the Hong Kong protests in 2014. Our
76 Marketing Theory 18(1)
empirical data are based on moderate participant observation, a visual analysis of photographs
taken by the researchers and secondary data stemming from the publicly available digital archives
of the Umbrella Movement. We employ the research findings firstly in order to identify the
promotional techniques of protest art in the occupied spaces of the Umbrella Movement. Secondly,
we contribute to existing theory and practice through a critical discussion concerning the role of
protest art in developing spatial aesthetics, audience engagement tools and arts-infused education
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how our observations provide the opportunity to inform, rethink
and extend the boundaries of arts marketing and marketing theory in general.
The Hong Kong protest camps and protest art
The 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, occurred between Sep-
tember 2014 and December 2014 (Kaiman, 2014). Since Hong Kong's reunification with China in
1997, and following the principle of `one country, two systems', this special administrative region
preserves a high degree of autonomy regarding its political and legal organization. The Chinese
government's decision, in August 2014, to introduce an alternative electoral framework which
redefined the terms of universal suffrage ­ by controlling the selection of the candidates ­ triggered
a series of protests that demanded the continuation of democratic elections in Hong Kong.
Demonstrations outside the Hong Kong Government Headquarters began in late September 2014,
gradually forming the Umbrella Movement which created protest camps in several other areas of
Hong Kong. The three main sites of the protests were formed in the arterial routes and key areas of
the city (Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok) which remained closed for almost 70 days; it is
estimated that at their peak, there were more than 100,000 protesters (Roantree and Jucca, 2014).
Following more than two months of protests ­ characterized by tensions with the police and anti-
protesters ­ the occupation sites were cleared in December 2014 without the protests having
achieved any promises from the state (Dapiran, 2015).
Together with the mass mobilization of the public, it is well documented (BBC News, 2014a;
Lau, 2014) that the most prominent features of the Umbrella Movement involved the spontaneous
outpouring of creativity, including the production and display of protest art as vehicles for both
communicating messages and engaging the public. Strategically occupying key urban intersections
at the heart of Hong Kong's business and commercial districts, the protesters carefully installed
diverse forms of highly visible, imaginative and interactive protest art. Adopting the umbrella as a
symbol of passive resistance, hundreds of artistic installations of yellow umbrellas in forms that
included patchwork canopies, statues, trees and origami mobile emerged. Furthermore, colourful
banners, lamp posts, tents, leaflets, stands and posters provided artistic platforms for pro-
democracy quotes, visual symbols, icons of resistance, as well as caricatures of politicians. In
sharp contrast to the surrounding skyscraper architecture, the proliferation and ingenious
demonstration of protest art transformed the urban environment ­ within the occupied camps ­ into
open-air spaces for arts participation and engagement. A variety of collaborative projects
encouraged protesters, Hong Kong citizens and tourists, often without any artistic background, to
actively participate in the co-production of protest art. Interactive street painting events, chalk
drawing on the pavements and blind contour sessions inspired and engaged pedestrians who
enthusiastically contributed to the co-creation of these impulsive, unconventional and all-inclusive
protest art projects. Last but not least, the Umbrella Movement utilized protest art to inform and
educate audiences as to their collective aims and with regard to issues of social justice and uni-
versal suffrage. Protesters organized and created arts-infused learning environments, including a
Patsiaouras et al. 77
specially designated study area, `mobile democracy classrooms' and free libraries in the protest
camps of Admiralty and Causeway Bay. In general, protesters' art that was displayed in the camps
and through social and mainstream media played a crucial role in politically awakening the Hong
Kong citizens and in attracting worldwide attention to their cause.
Arts marketing and protest art
Favouring a sociological perspective, we view art in general and protest art in particular as
complex constructs which mirror and communicate to wider audiences the interrelationships
between social, historical and cultural forces (Rodner and Preece, 2016; Schroeder, 2010). We
consider protest art as a broad term, encompassing both a work of fine art, such as Picasso's
Guernica, and a site-specific installation related to environmental injustice, to give two examples
(Reed, 2005). Following Jasper (2014), we suggest that protest art's main objectives are to provide
a form of criticism towards social injustice and convey messages and statements designed to
influence or cause positive change in society. In our context, the Umbrella Movement employed
spatial aesthetics, audience engagement techniques and arts-infused educational events that sought
to express protesters' critique of the Chinese government's decisions, highlight injustice and turn
into a change agent. Aiming to build on these three promotional methods, a review of relevant arts
marketing literatures is presented below, designed to suggest ways in which existing marketing
practices might constructively inform and engage with the protest art of social movements.
Spatial aesthetics
In the realm of shopping and marketing environments, spatial aesthetics and cultural production of
retail spaces have been explored in spectacular marketplace sites such as the Nike Town (Penaloza,
1998; Sherry, 1998), a festival shopping mall in Dublin (Maclaran and Brown, 2005) and a
menswear fashion house in the Netherlands (van Marrewijk and Broos, 2012). Likewise, in artistic
and specific cultural contexts, consumers' and visitors' multisensory and aesthetic experiences
towards places have been examined in museums (Goulding, 2001; Joy and Sherry, 2003), concert
halls (Debenedetti et al., 2014; Skandalis et al., 2016), Disney World's EPCOT Center (Houston
and Meamber, 2011) and anti-market festivals (Kozinets, 2002). These studies, among others, have
provided novel insights as to how the spatial dimensions of contemporary marketplaces, arts
venues and festivals, create and shape consumers' experiences and their emotional bonds with
specific places. However, the spatial contexts and aesthetic processes, explored in the existing
literature, differ significantly from the multifaceted spatial character of urban protest camps and
the participatory and political aesthetics of protest art. Protesters carefully choose their protest sites
and utilize various spatial strategies and aesthetics to attract large number of participants and to
strengthen the visibility of political symbols and messages (Brown et al., 2017). Thereupon, the
strategic display of protest art develops the capacity to generate collective experiences and unify
audiences on both intellectual and emotional levels. With this in mind, we can identify certain
similarities and resonance between the spatial aesthetics, ideological purposes and promotional
tactics of street art (Borghini et al., 2010) and protest art. Exploring ideologies of public space
consumption, Visconti et al. (2010) suggested that the employment of street art in unexpected
places is capable of creating and expressing `an aesthetics commons' for individuals who seek to
adopt common identities and a sense of belonging. Nonetheless, street artists' individualistic or
collective outcomes are usually focussed on specific neighbourhoods and aim to engage local
78 Marketing Theory 18(1)
communities, while protesters' use of spatial aesthetics aim to mobilize vast audiences, attract
global attention and enhance a sense of solidarity within and outside the movement.
Through occupying public squares, parks and/or central streets, social movements' protest art
alters the urban landscape and for a short period of time prompts visitors to both embrace social
change and consider an unconventional and artistic viewpoint of their city. Oakes and Warnaby
(2011) examined how outdoor musical events transform the environment and contribute in
attracting audiences and changing consumers' perceptions of urban spaces. Moving beyond the
physical boundaries of artistic organizations, scholars have explored the promotion of open-air
festivals (Wilks, 2014), brand building of visual artists in London's outdoor sites (Sjo
¨holm and
Pasquinelli, 2014) and the cultural branding of Liverpool (Patterson, 2010). These outdoor arts
events and projects can turn into generators of collective artistic experiences and create a fresh
awareness of a city's aesthetic character. However, the aforementioned site-specific and well-
organized arts marketing activities occur within a public funded or market governed perspective,
which stands in contrast with protest art's non-commercial, empowering and anti-authoritarian
features. Consequently, in this article, we use the Umbrella Movement protest camps as alternative
urban contexts to conceptualize the spatial and aesthetic organization of protest art and subse-
quently to rethink and develop the spatial aesthetics of open-air art events, public or street art.
Audience engagement techniques
Over the last 30 years, several arts organizations have experienced a gradual transformation from
being considered as presenters of tailored programmes to be seen as organizers of experiential
settings and participatory events and projects (Ryan et al., 2010). Cultural policies, together with
funding terms and conditions, directly encourage artists and arts managers to formulate strategies
and performances based on audience participation and engagement (Knell, 2006). Kemp (2015)
sought to define the meaning(s) and outcome of audience engagement, within the sphere of arts and
cultural organizations, concluding that artistic performances should evoke feelings, emotions and
collective responses which motivate consumers' participation. Consequently, audience engage-
ment in artistic experiences has the potential to foster social interaction, build a sense of belonging
and also strengthen individuals' attachment to the art message or organization's aims. In a similar
manner, social movements' success depends heavily upon individuals' participation (della Porta,
2013) and collaborative protest art can constitute a pre-eminent vehicle for the engagement of
citizens in collective expression and identification with pro-democratic ideals.
Arts marketing studies, especially in the domain of the performing arts, demonstrate how
artists' creative activities can blur the traditional divisions between producers and audiences in
theatres (Ryan et al., 2010), orchestra halls (Crawford et al., 2014) and museums (vom Lehn;
2006; vom Lehn and Heath, 2016). Within these experiential cultural contexts, consumers ­ as
members of the audience ­ can be transformed into collaborative producers, since they are
invited to take an active role in the co-creation of artistic services and experiences. Heritage
organizations (Minkiewicz et al., 2014), art galleries (Minkiewicz et al., 2016), theatres
(Walmsley, 2014) and online sites (Ren and Montgomery, 2012) have been turned into
experiential and collaborative platforms where visitors engage and participate in the co-
production of art. The importance of collectivity in these contexts has been emphasized by
Caru
` and Cova (2006, 2007) who explored classical music concerts and recommended that
service providers (organizers or artists) should act as `guides' who facilitate audience partici-
pation. These carefully planned collaborative performances, for the co-creation of consumption
Patsiaouras et al. 79
experiences, take place within the designed spaces of established arts institutions and typically
engage with performing arts audiences. Against this background, we turn our attention to the
complex spatial and experiential terrain of urban protest camps where ideologically, culturally
and age diverse audiences have access to public and collaborative protest art projects. In
considering the co-creation of politically inspired art, this exploration seeks to offer fresh
insights as to how collaborative art can enhance both consumers' and citizens' awareness of
social issues.
Arts-infused educational events
A plethora of arts institutions around the world act as educators, employing marketing commu-
nications and promotion for their events (Bresler, 2007; Kolb, 2005). Oakes et al. (2013)
emphasized the role of web-based forums and metaphysical branding as promotional vehicles of
artistic services that could arouse consumers' desires for aspirational self-improvement, pursuit of
the arts or university education. Butler (2000) proposed that local communities ­ and especially
young consumers ­ should be recognized as the primary market target segments for arts projects
that seek to educate and develop audiences via events, platforms and alternative distribution
networks. In the United Kingdom, arts and film festivals promote and celebrate the artistic
achievements of individuals who faced mental health battles in order to engage and educate
communities on how to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination (Clarke and Knifton, 2009).
Also, museum exhibitions seek to enhance audiences' knowledge around urban renewal and
common cultural heritage (Lazzeretti and Capone, 2015) and in the face of funding cuts a variety of
arts centres have created digital art spaces and online interactive tools which aim to strengthen non-
arts students' academic motivation and popularize arts consumption (Enhuber, 2015; Winner et al.,
2013). The aforementioned arts marketing studies mainly approach audiences' education and
development either from the psychological angle (relating to visitors' motivation) or via the
adoption and consideration of government social policies, community enterprise strategies and
measurable participation rates (Osborne and Rentschler, 2010). On the contrary, we focus on an
ideological perspective that views arts marketing as a trajectory for social inclusion and change
(Khan, 2015; Navaie, 2004), and accordingly, we seek to explore how protesters promoted arts-
infused learning practices in the open, ephemeral and all-inclusive environments of protest camps.
Considering that the vast majority of Hong Kong protesters and audiences were young people and
students (CUHK, 2014), we propose that there is a need for a more concrete conceptualization on
the role of protest art in educating audiences and cultivating social capital.
The current literature discussed a variety of promotional methods for outdoor arts events, the
co-creation of cultural services and arts-inspired education of audiences, primarily with regard to
the performing and visual arts sectors. These studies have emphasized the significance of place for
artistic experiences and consumers' reactions to interactive art and educational programmes;
however, they do not reflect the spatial complexity, multifarious collaboration and ideological
sensitivity required for the production and promotion of urban protest art. Thereupon and con-
sidering the identification of `more specific arts-related marketing frameworks' (Fillis, 2011: 15),
we now introduce the innovative promotional techniques of protest art by a pro-democracy social
movement. As O'Reilly and Kerrigan (2010: 3) suggest, arts marketing research can lead scholars
to interesting places: `in the moshpit at a rock concert, contemplating a pile of boxes in Tate
Modern's Turbine Hall, filming people at a music festival, talking to fans in a pub, reading novels
and comics'. Through visiting, exploring, photographing and critically discussing Umbrella
80 Marketing Theory 18(1)
Movement's creative activities in the heart of Hong Kong, we also invite the readers of this article
to immerse themselves in this fascinating public space.
Methodology
In this section, we analyse our methods of data collection and analysis from the Hong Kong protest
camps as research sites. Several studies on arts marketing theory have presented case study
approaches, examining topics including marketing/brand activities in museums/galleries (Pusa and
Uusitalo, 2014; Rentschler et al., 2012) and visual artist's creativity (O'Reilly, 2005). For this
study, the ideological diversity and organizational volatility of an organic, altering and dynamic
political movement and the geographical complexity characterizing the occupied areas meant that
the completion of a `holistic' case study approach was not possible. A series of lively sit-in protests
­ together with dozens of artistic and protest-related events ­ occurred from the 26th of September
2014 to the 15th of December 2014 across three sites. Consequently, the identification or
demarcation of specific `case study' boundaries (Stake, 1994) with an intensive examination of the
whole setting (Bryman, 2012) over a sustained period of time did not constitute a feasible plan.
Empirically, our study was based on moderate participant observation (Bernard, 1994) pri-
marily photo-documentation (Rose, 2012; van Leeuwen and Jewitt, 2001) so as to collect data from
the context under investigation. Two researchers spent a week ­ during the peak of the protests in
November 2014 ­ at the Hong Kong protest sites, collecting empirical data comprised of photo-
graphic images, observations, field notes and a varied assemblage of artistic objects. The
researchers adopted a moderate participant observation approach (DeWalt and DeWalt, 1998;
Spradley, 1980) throughout the process of collecting primary data. During the first two days, the
researchers acted as observers strolling in the protest camps, photographing and immersing
themselves in the protest sites, protest activities and overall atmosphere. In the following days, the
researchers moderately engaged in activities such as (a) interacting with the protesters through
informal discussions and (b) participating in some of the creative activities, such as post-it writing
and sticking as well as having their portraits drawn by local artists. These purposeful meanders
around the camps, the observations and the discussions with protesters and bystanders resulted in
field notes that included descriptions of the physical context, the presence and promotion of dif-
ferent forms of art; the creative activities taking place; and thoughts regarding the protest and the
use of art as part of it.
Our primary data set includes almost 300 photographic images collected from two different
protest camps (Admiralty and Mong Kok), field notes from observations and collection of artistic
objects, such as postal-cards and drawings. Additionally, we examined secondary data stemming
from existing digital archiving of photographic images created to preserve the artwork of the Hong
Kong social movement, which was primarily established by the Umbrella Movement Visual
Archives and Research Collective (Hilgers, 2015). For our analysis, we adopted a unifying
approach with material stemming from both the field notes and visual collected data, which
allowed us to develop a closer link between the abstract process of conceptualizing (as part of the
researcher's interpretative work), the experientially derived observations (Suchar, 1997) and the
photographic images. We employed visual analysis (Rose, 2012) on both the photographic
material we collected and the existing digital archives, in order to examine interrelationships
between arts marketing theory and how the protests' aims and causes were promoted at the site.
Following Van Leeuween and Jewitt (2001: 4), the main aim of using photographic images in our
analysis and discussion of findings was `to serve as records of reality, as documentary evidence of
Patsiaouras et al. 81
the people, places, things, actions and events they depict'. To protect the anonymity and con-
fidentiality of protesters, we focus only on photographic images that depict artistic installations and
public artwork already widely available on the Internet ­ while covering the faces of bystanders
and removing any information which could identify particular individuals.
Findings
The collected data were based on a careful conceptualization of our main research objectives
(Rieger, 1996), and following an examination of our literature review on the broadening of arts
marketing theory and its potential to engage with protests, we identified three main themes that
will be discussed in this article. First, we examine and discuss the creativity and `aesthetic and
spatial organization of protest art' employed by Hong Kong protesters, used to enhance awareness
about their causes, transform the urban environment and captivate the imagination of wide
audiences. Second, we focus on the use of creative methods to support increased participation in
and co-creation of artistic activities and experiences as vehicles to engage the audience with
protest's artwork and messages. Finally, we elaborate on the value and promotion of protesters'
artwork for the development and education of audiences', which facilitated the communication of
their aims and sought to induce social change (Navaie, 2004). Tying together insights from the
literature review with our observations, data analysis and interpretation from the Hong Kong
protest sites, we critically discuss in the following sections how our findings can inform, enrich and
even update arts marketing theory.
The aesthetic and spatial organization of protest art
Located at the central business district of the Hong Kong Island and surrounded by government
buildings and shopping malls, the Occupy site of Admiralty turned into the epicentre of the pro-
democracy camps. From the east entrance of the site, long colourful banners were hung on
overhead bridges and roads. The banner displays included pro-democracy slogans and an image
portraying the President of China holding an umbrella. The iconic and symbolic status of the
umbrella gained prominence for the movement when protesters used their open umbrellas as
shields against police tear gas two days after the start of the protests (Schumacher, 2014).
Umbrellas were used as artistic objects and installations both in the protest sites and in other parts
of Hong Kong during the protests. Walking through the central protest camp, we observed a mosaic
of connected umbrellas strung between two footbridges, as a canopy, while large yellow umbrellas
were positioned on each side of the occupied avenue (see Figure 1). Similar to the use of sun-
flowers by Taiwanese protesters in 2014 and the Goddess of Democracy statue in Tiananmen
Square in 1989, the opened yellow umbrella turned into the celebrated aesthetic symbol of the
movement (Lim, 2015) and the protesters carefully and imaginatively installed such site-specific
protest artwork so as to ensure maximum visibility.
The recognition and acceptance of the umbrella as an enduring emblem led to a popular online
competition to create an imaginative logo design for the protest movement, involving participants
from all over the world (Li, 2014). Through the growing connectivity offered by the Internet, we
observe the perhaps surprising adoption of a conventional marketing strategy for the development
of Umbrella Movement's logo. The organization of a voluntary design competition embodies
elements of crowdsourcing ­ the engagement of a crowd or group for a collective objective ­ which
is gradually turning into a popular marketing mechanism for the co-production of brands, products
82 Marketing Theory 18(1)
or services (Cova and Dali, 2009; Gabriel et al., 2015). Bauer and Gegenhuber (2015) accentuated
the marketing capacity of crowdsourcing to share knowledge, produce and develop digital arte-
facts. Focussing on the production of artwork, the authors argue that the epicentre of originality
and creativity alters from something completely `new' to innovative and collaborative patterns of
reusing and reframing existing ideas. Likewise, the digital development of the Hong Kong social
movement's logo shifted protesters' artistic efforts and communication of goals towards an online
and global network of artists sympathetic with the aims of the Umbrella Movement.
Examining arts directors' perceptions of visual brand identity, Phillips et al. (2014) indicated
the importance of colour for the creation of a strong and communicative visual identity. The
authors proposed that art directors aim to employ brand visual elements which are identifiable
and original in their sector to secure competitive advantage. Although social movements do not
compete for a commercial market share, colours and ribbons distinguish and reflect diverse
collective identities and stimulate emotional responses from protesters (Martin, 2015). Despite
the fact that Hong Kong's Movement lacked a team to co-ordinate the promotion of its artwork,
gradually and spontaneously the colour yellow was adopted by protesters for ribbons, banners
and umbrellas. Creative artistic installations of yellow umbrellas could be found in many parts of
the city, including an `Umbrella Man' statue, `umbrella bushes' made of origami art and cal-
ligraphy on umbrellas displayed in the camps, among others. Concentrating on protesters'
emotions, Sawer (2007) offered a critical review on the importance of political colours for social
movements. She considered the display of colours as a significant statement of a movement's
identity, collective action and sense of community. The author underlines how the employment
of visual strategies by social movements creates `symbolic languages that are about emotional
identification as well as about organizational needs for distinctive brands and brand loyalty, to
use the language of modern marketing' (Sawer, 2007: 54). Concurring with Sawer's (2007)
analysis, umbrellas and the colour yellow both served as visual identification of an emerging
social movement and strengthened the presence of a distinctive visual and `branding' identity
around protesters' goals and causes. Focussing on the collective nature of creativity in the
Figure 1. Image of interweaved umbrellas as a canopy (photographed at the Admiralty on 14 November
2014).
Patsiaouras et al. 83
development of an art brand by visual artists (Rodner and Kerrigan, 2014), we argue that brand
managers might learn from social movements' creative efforts to communicate their aims
through the visible features of a unifying protest symbol.
Walking throughout the occupy site of Admiralty, we experienced an explosion of creativity
involving visually striking handmade signs, banners, sculptures and artistic installations of
yellow umbrellas. Fillis and Rentschler (2005) suggested that during periods of change, the
concept of creativity in the arts adopts a wider and multidimensional scope intermingling the role
of people and objects. Correspondingly, we can argue that, during a period of turbulence, the
Hong Kong protesters' objective to promote their aims was channelled into an outburst of artistic
expression and creativity, amalgamating the role of protest art with the perceptions and political
views of the protesters, protest's opponents and the divided Hong Kong citizenry. In her seminal
paper on creativity, Hirschman (1983) claimed that artists (and ideologists) characterized by
self-oriented creativity and product-centred marketing consider a variety of viewpoints on social
issues, even if their perspective might oppose predominant popular views, sentiments and social
norms; a process that introduces the opportunity for social change through the promotion of art.
From a holistic perspective, the Umbrella Movement protest art has not been the outcome of a
single artist whose efforts might be characterized by individual self-oriented creativity. Indi-
vidual creators have been identified for only half of the 400 artistic objects now in the Umbrella
Movement Research Collective's collection (Qin, 2016). Nonetheless, due to their organized
artistic practices and common intentions, we might approach the creators as a group (Fillis,
2002) or a creative organization (Fillis and Rentschler, 2005) wherein artistic self-expression
and collective creativity was purposefully channelled towards unified aims characterized by
ideological independence. One of the intrinsic values of self-oriented artists is that they can
challenge audiences who `may find themselves confronted by ethical issues, moral choices and
emotions that are difficult or painful to acknowledge' (Hirschman, 1983: 49). As expected, the
occupation of arterial routes, major city intersections and public space by protesters was met
with both feelings of support and hostility from the Hong Kong public, causing a `yellow' (pro-
Occupy) versus `blue' (anti-Occupy) war on social media (Chan and Tsui, 2014). School clo-
sures, blocked highways and economic disruption affecting business interrupted the everyday
lives of people in a city where the last violent riots occurred in the 1960's (The Economist,
2016). Both Hirschman (1983: 48) and Fillis (2011) view public acceptance as an important
objective of self-oriented artists, since `by creating something that vividly expresses their values
and emotions, the audience might then be persuaded to accept their perspective'. Similarly, Hong
Kong protesters created protest art which distinguished their values and political beliefs, and
imaginatively promoted their creative outcomes, in order to confront their ideological opponents
and attract the attention of indifferent citizens (BBC News, 2014).
At the heart of the protest site, a large stand displayed small connected images, primarily of
superheroes, celebrities and political figures, holding the yellow umbrella. Images of Thor, Hulk,
Bruce Lee, Batman, Mahatma Gandhi, Che Guevara and Queen Elizabeth II (among very few
female figures) are easily identified, mingled with other famous Asian fictional and non-fictional
characters (see Figure 2). Focussing on Hong Kong protesters' use of superheroes, Garrett (2014)
argues that the movement employed them as visual metaphors and turned them into cultural and
political icons of resistance against the erosion of Hong Kong's core values through China's
efforts to control the elections. Although marketing and arts marketing theory has paid attention
to the use of celebrities (Erdogan, 1999; Hackley and Hackley, 2015) and famous artists
(Bradshaw and Holbrook, 2007; Fillis, 2015) as vehicles of communicating brands and ideas, the
84 Marketing Theory 18(1)
use of superheroes to cultivate intimacy and attachment has remained unexamined. The bizarre
collage of superheroes and ideologically diverse political figures not only captivated the
attention of the perplexed viewer but stimulated feelings of familiarity and growing interest
towards the aims of the movement. Rather than adopting and portraying a particular superhero or
celebrity embodying specific ideals ­ for example, Captain America (patriotism) ­ the cultural,
political and aesthetic diversity of these comic heroes and famous individuals brings the visitor a
sense of inclusiveness and universality which can create attachment with the movement's aims
through the figures portrayed.
Besides the portrayal of superheroes, we observed posters, clothing and balloons which dis-
played pictures of Hollywood action movie heroes, as well as Martin Luther King's image and his
`I Have a Dream' slogan. Examining the behaviour and practices of famous European artists during
the 19th and 20th century, Anderson et al. (2009) suggested that tactics such as an embrace of
foreign techniques (adoption) or the amalgamation of traditional artistic styles with foreign
influences (fusion) can inform the business practices of the 21st-century global manager. Anderson
et al.'s (2009) generic concept of artistic and managerial fusion can be viewed in an analogous and
metaphorical sense, taking into account authors' ­ somehow superficial ­ comparison between
Picasso's radical combination of foreign approaches with a European style and the efforts of a
cosmopolitan CEO to increase mobile penetration in Africa. Nonetheless, the visual display of
Marvel comic heroes and the protagonists of acclaimed anti-authoritarian films ­ such as V for
Vendetta and the Matrix trilogy ­ presents an interesting example of fusion practices between
Western popular culture and the promotion of protest art in `Asia's World City' (Hong Kong
Government, 2002). Fillis and Lee (2011) discussed how visionary awareness and a collective
approach to creativity have significantly enhanced the internationalization strategies of Korean
performing arts organizations. Possibly, the imaginative promotion and collective improvisation
by Hong Kong protesters, to infuse Western icons in their artistic installations, can inform inno-
vative and creative internationalization practices of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and
artistic organizations in both Asian and Western contexts.
Finally, in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, we observed a spatial context
commandeered for the display and promotion of artwork in the two, most prominent, protest

camps. Hong Kong protesters created unique public sites of communication, artistic expression
and political cultivation at the heart of a major international financial centre. These idiosyncratic
spaces emerged in stark contrast to the backdrop of emblematic skyscrapers (see Figure 3). Small
outdoor libraries, artistic installations, posters, banners, sculptures and Post-it walls were orga-
nized and placed within a few hundred square meters. For three months, the protesters generated
and fostered an alternative space within which they promoted their political messages and chan-
nelled their creativity through artistic installations. We suggest that the artistic expression and
promotion within the occupied public space of Hong Kong protests can turn into a platform adding
to the existing research (Borghini et al., 2010; Oakes and Warnaby, 2011; Sjo
¨holm and Pasquinelli,
2014) on arts marketing theory rethinking the concept of space and place identity beyond the
geographical boundaries of galleries, museums and theatres. Apart from the (anti)consumption of
art or symbolic brands in public spaces (Brown and Sherry, 2003; Chatzidakis et al., 2012; Visconti
et al., 2010), our findings identify and stress the innovative employment of spatial strategies for the
promotion of Umbrella Movement's protest art and protesters' ability to aesthetically reshape and
transform the impersonal and colourless urban environment into a non-traditional and inclusive
space for experiences, collective expression and arts engagement as we argue below.
`Audience engagement and co-creation of protest art'
In both Admiralty and Mong Kok, we observed and actively participated in the movement's
employment of artistic performances and interactive activities to enhance audience engagement
and identify with the aims of the protest. Protesters' efforts to maximize the impact of their
messages and communicate through artwork with the individuals who visited the protest camps are
encapsulated in the words of the Hong Kong Arts Centre's former Exhibition Director, Oscar Ho
Hing-kay, who argued that `the entire city is a work of art, and everyone is an artist' (Pollack,
2015). Similar to the John Lennon Wall in Prague ­ a wall filled with lyrics and graffiti inspired by
Figure 3. Image showing the unique public sites of communication and artistic expression (photograph taken
at the Admiralty on 15 November 2014).
86 Marketing Theory 18(1)
Beatles songs and Lennon's life ­ the protesters created their own Lennon Wall (see Figure 4), at
the heart of the main protest camp in Admiralty. The wall was spontaneously created by a group of
social activists who disseminated colourful Post-its and pens to protesters and visitors, asking them
to write and express their thoughts, feelings and attitudes towards the movement. In a few days, the
Lennon Wall in Hong Kong became a colourful mosaic of Post-it notes which included written
messages, lyrics and epigrams, expressing solidarity with and encouragement towards the protests.
Almost 10,000 sticky notes ­ including messages of support from tourists and locals ­ were
counted by pro-democracy protesters who sought to rebuild the wall ­ digitally ­ after the end of
the protest (Ng, 2014). Consequently, the co-creation and transformation of a curved staircase in
central Hong Kong to an artistic wall constitutes an improvisational mode of arts engagement
attracting individuals whose previous involvement in arts co-creation events and protest activities
could have been limited or non-existent.
We (as researchers) and thousands of other individuals became active participants in the co-
production of the Lennon Wall Hong Kong, an experience which involved our physical presence
and action for the co-creation of protest artwork. As participants, we posted our own messages on
the Hong Kong Lennon Wall and our experience was personalized since there was an element of
personal relevance and a sense of emotional immersion. Similarly, thousands of protesters and
participants became co-producers of public artwork, creating a highly collaborative and inventive
visual arts project characterized by mass participation and interaction. As Kozinets et al. (2008:
352) suggest consumer creation can be viewed beyond the prism of pleasure-seeking, experiential
and leisure activities, and we can see consumers `as continuing in the working tradition of orga-
nized work networks, art studios, factories', since collective creativity is fostered by `shared
values, ideologies . . . collective political action, and the shared base of grounded knowledge'. In
the context of the Umbrella Movement, our findings indicate that along with contemporary con-
sumer protest practices ­ such as Internet petitions and boycotting ­ the co-creation of protest art
emerges as a means of directly challenging institutional power and of influencing government and
corporate policies.

Citizens, tourists and even visiting children were encouraged by protesters and artists to
utilize artistic tools and resources in order to engage with the movement and its aims. The Italian
painter Francesco Lietti, based in Hong Kong, specializes in the creation of paintings portraying
the city; during the protests, he organized interactive street painting events where anyone could
contribute in the production of collaborative canvases (ArtRadar, 2014). These street painting
sessions ­ entitled `the Voice of the Streets' ­ provided a space for engagement with the co-
production of artwork that was expressing universal values related to peace, democracy and
representation. Becoming a member of the protest community himself, in this novel and
experiential street context, we can argue that the artist adopted the role of the `guide' or facil-
itator who enables and constructs the co-production of art and experiences (Arnould and Price,
1993; Caru
` and Cova, 2006). Caru
` and Cova (2006) suggest that immersion in an experiential
context derives gradually, following the stages of nesting, investigating and stamping. Nesting
embodies a feeling of comfort and familiarity with the experience, which leads the audience to
investigate further the unfamiliar territory. Through stamping, the audience member ascribes
particular meanings to the experience deriving from their own personal history and feelings.
Rethinking audience engagement practices in the context of protest camps, we observed how
visitors, tourists and sympathizers with the Umbrella Movement gradually developed a degree of
familiarity with the collaborative projects which progressively led to further exploration of this
unusual artistic terrain. We also noticed that dozens of Post-it notes on the Hong Kong Wall
included personalized messages and drawings, expressing association with the Umbrella
Movement. Creating non-traditional art spaces for co-participation, engagement and interaction,
both the interactive painting process and the co-creation of the John Lennon Wall can be seen as
platforms where audience members immersed themselves in protest art. These outdoor projects
of protest art constitute novel platforms for existing arts marketing research (Minkiewicz et al.,
2016; vom Lehn and Heath, 2016) to consider how communities, social movements or networks
of audiences and artists can turn into collaborators of creative processes distinguished by
openness, engagement and the communication of universal values.
We also actively participated in the production of street protest art. Artists produced blind
contour drawings of protesters or visitors ­ including of this articles' authors ­ and engaged in
creative street art activities throughout the protest site. The artists engaged and interacted with
visitors, inviting them over to produce individual face portraits on A5 sheets, with a pre-printed
yellow and black background in accordance with the emblematic colours used by the protest
movement. Before, during and after the drawing of our portraits by a blindfolded artist, we
embarked upon a very informative discussion with the painters regarding the origins and
ideological background of the Umbrella Movement. Like other passengers, we found an
opportunity to be informed and exchange ideas about the protesters' demands while we engaged
and participated in the production of simple and imaginative artwork in a non-art context.
Additionally, we observed chalk drawings on roads and pavements by individuals expressing
their solidarity with the movement. The spread of artistic creativity and imagination throughout
the protest camps and city is summarized in the words of the former Director of the Hong Kong
Arts Centre who argued that the totality of artwork `reflects a collective spirit, and it is organic,
so it keeps growing'. He also stated that the productive outcomes of `some trained artists are
more conservative' when compared to the inventive street art created by protesters, visitors,
students, activists and tourists, all-together (Pollack, 2015). As mentioned above, these direct
comparisons and statements by art critics seem to add status along with aesthetic legitimacy to
the Umbrella Movement's protest art. The Hong Kong protesters' artwork was displayed at the
88 Marketing Theory 18(1)
`Disobedient Objects' exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, which aimed to
focus on how collective creativity and political activism challenge standard conceptions of art
and design (Victoria and Albert Museum, 2016).
By examining the innovative methods for audience engagement and co-creation of objects and
experiences, in the occupied spaces, we suggest that cultural policies (Knell, 2006) and arts
marketing theories (Kemp, 2015) can extend their conceptual boundaries by paying more attention
to collaborative creation, methods of engagement and communication of protest artwork by social
movements. Considering the duration, central locations and scale of the movement, thousands of
people became collaborative producers of several protest art projects that transformed the urban
landscape and communicated messages of solidarity and pro-democratic ideals. Contrary to public
perceptions of protest camps as arenas of violence, struggles for control and confrontation (della
Porta, 2006; Seferiadis and Johnston, 2012), our findings show how protesters instilled elements of
playfulness, imagination and humour in their cooperative artistic platforms. Within this unique art
context, we identify nonlinear and multifarious collaborative activities, a sense of enduring
creativity and multi-sided spaces for untended and open spaces of massive arts participation. We
suggest that, especially during periods of budget cuts to arts programmes, national arts councils
and art practitioners can encourage and develop sustainable and empowering community arts
projects so as to increase art engagement in deprived neighbourhoods or rural areas.
Protest art for the development and education of audiences
Several social movements attempted to promote audience development and education within their
camps through cultural strategies and pedagogical experiments (Anyon, 2005; Feigenbaum et al.,
2014). For example, more than three hundred lectures and workshops on political education
occurred in the protest camps of the Occupy Wall Street Movement (Di Salvo, 2013), while
protesters in Taksim Square, Istanbul combined public reading and peaceful protesting (Henton,
2013) and anti-globalization camps screened anti-authoritarian films and discussed countercultural
art projects (Pleyers, 2010).
Our observations in Hong Kong demonstrate the employment of protest art as a promotional
vehicle to educate audiences about social issues and justice. We observed how the Umbrella
Movement fostered participation by creating appropriate platforms to inform and educate pro-
testers and visitors in the locality, and globally through online communications. Exploring the
emergence of technology, arts marketing research has emphasized the importance of eWoM
through social media in performing and fine arts (Hausmann and Poellman, 2016; Wroot, 2015)
and online networking sites in allowing companies to disseminate information (Ryan et al.,
2010). Focussing on politically inspired art, we observed how the Umbrella Movement turned
social media into prominent and popular digital platforms, such as the Facebook page `People in
the Streets', that acted as an initiative to collect personal stories from individuals around the
protests. Inspired by the famous `Humans of New York' Facebook page, the protesters digitally
displayed a picture of a protester, a couple and even a journalist, accompanied by a quote about
their everyday realities, relationships or working conditions in the city of Hong Kong. Addi-
tionally, the movement's main Facebook webpage was widely displayed through large yellow
banners in the protest camps. Characterized by The Guardian as a `social media revolution' (The
Guardian, 2014), through their smart phones the protesters managed to synchronize and co-
ordinate supply chains, medical teams and warnings regarding violence and attacks in protest
camps. Digital media were also turned into means of social protest and motivation, through the
Patsiaouras et al. 89
creation of a media art project which displayed short messages of solidarity from all over the
world appearing via a projector on a gigantic billboard in the protest areas (ArtRadar, 2014). The
key role of social media in the Umbrella Movement to access and inform wider audiences
reflects and builds upon the insights from marketing studies (Kerr et al., 2012; Makarem and Jae,
2016) which portray the World Wide Web as an alternative protest site for collective opposition
against the interests of powerful institutions.
In the main protest site Admiralty, we observed and photographed specially designed areas
where the protesters provided English language lessons displayed on whiteboards. Phrases like
`civil disobedience' and `universal suffrage' ­ the ultimate aim of the protestors ­ appeared in
both English and Cantonese characters, alongside a brief vocabulary list. On another white
board, we observed the translation of the terms `Wikipedia', `WikiLeaks', `Bitcoin' and `Occupy
Movement', aiming to encourage protesters and visitors to conduct further research about the
causes and objectives of the movement. Apart from these references to alternative payment
systems and non-profit journalistic organizations, the protesters displayed banners and yellow
leaflets with quotes about freedom and democracy by John Lennon, Nelson Mandela and
Mahatma Ghandi. In the central protest camp of the Admiralty, we observed how the protesters
created a `study corner' (see Figure 5) several meters from the central highway, including tables,
chairs, reading lamps and shelves in a small library in a fenced but publicly visible area. Large
yellow and blue tents protected readers from rain, while signs indicated that flash photography
was banned. Passengers and demonstrators could attend calligraphy workshops, pick a book
from the library and quietly study among the tables. Students were particularly encouraged to
complete their homework in the study corner, with volunteer tutors offering free assistance on
several academic subjects including mathematics and physics. This unconventional study space
was carefully infused with small installations and Post-it notes related to the movement, not only
Figure 5. Image of `study corner' (photograph taken at Admiralty on 15 November 2014).
90 Marketing Theory 18(1)
offering a sense of community but also reflecting protesters' efforts to facilitate the everyday
process of learning and education even within what the Hong Kong government considered to be
an illegal camp. Consequently, we suggest that arts-based educational practices within social
movements can turn into an effective promotional tool to induce social change and foster
democratization, despite the lack of modern teaching infrastructures and technological tools.
Experimental outdoor theatres and existing or emerging groups of radical performance pedagogy
(Colomina et al., 2015; Garoian, 1999) that seek to produce ephemeral utopian spaces and
amalgamate experimental aesthetics and interdisciplinary critical education (Gomez-Pena and
Sifuentes, 2011) can draw inspiration from the use of protest spaces for arts-infused educational
practices and horizontal notions of experimental co-learning.
Following these examples from the Hong Kong protest camps, our findings identify and
emphasize the potential of arts marketing to become a vehicle for community development, social
change and education of audiences (Navaie, 2004). Accordingly, we highlight the capacity of
protest art to educate and empower young people and foster equality within communities and urban
contexts. Based on our observations and readings around the potential of art to widen the social
imaginary and induce social change, we suggest arts marketing theorists and arts organizations
(Kolb, 2005; Osborne and Rentschler, 2010) ­ for example, non-profit arts organizations and
community arts centres ­ might draw their attention to the means of improvisation and creativeness
used by social movements in order to develop inclusive educational programmes, identify inno-
vative public performance spaces and explore experimental means of stimulating fruitful dialogues
around social and political issues. Especially during times of financial scarcity and conservative
cost-cutting in the arts and education sectors, art-infused education could both contribute to the
expansion of arts marketing practices and benefit the most vulnerable citizens such as refugees, the
homeless and the underprivileged.
Protest art and (arts) marketing theory
Following the lack of an empirical study on the promotion of protest art within marketing
studies, we argue that the examination of Umbrella Movement's creative displays, collaborative
art performances and arts-infused educational activities can invigorate the theoretical resources
of arts marketing and marketing theory in general. Our article proposes, for the first time, the
importance of theorizing and understanding the spatial and artistic practices in protest camps as
alternative and emerging arts-related frameworks and valuable empirical platforms for advan-
cing arts marketing theory. We suggest that the resourceful and creative use of the occupied
urban space, by protesters and sympathizers, provides a novel and fresh conceptualization
around spatial strategies and improvisational techniques for artistic promotion. Our findings
depict and elaborate upon the transformation of Hong Kong's arterial thoroughfares and public
squares into an urban protest art platform, which works to reclaim and re-enchant the built
environment with aesthetic and ideological interventions that galvanized passengers' active
participation. Appropriation of urban space, encampment and high-functioning infrastructures ­
among other spatial features of the protest camps ­ facilitated and enabled the transient,
spontaneous and to some extent celebratory co-production and communication of protest art.
Consequently, we emphasize the value and powerful potential of promoted protest art in
reframing urban environments, disrupting the mundane fabric of a densely populated city and
attracting large audiences in captivating and contested contexts of collective artistic expression
and experimentation.
Patsiaouras et al. 91
Recognizing that the promotion of protest art is capable of transforming perceptions of urban
outdoor spaces, we argue that our findings can contribute to rethinking and re-imagining the
marketing mix variable of `place' for arts marketing. Thereupon, we suggest a conceptual shift or
extension of the traditional marketing mix variable of `place' ­ perceived, for instance, as location
(art studio), settings (opera house), distribution (commercial/art collective galleries) or locales
(open-air concert) ­ towards a broader notion of space. Unlike site-specific and carefully planned
outdoor art events which have been discussed in arts marketing literature (O'Reilly and Kerrigan,
2010), we identify the capability of effectively promoted protest art to energetically demand,
organically spread and to some degree aesthetically de-alienate the monotonous space and sky-
scraper architecture of Hong Kong. In synergy with Umbrella Movements' `virtual' spaces
(Facebook page, media art projector), the public display of protest art transformed city's financial
centre and key commercial areas into an arts space characterized by openness and increased
visibility that stimulated public participation and attracted worldwide media attention. Protesters'
promotional tactics turned their art into a `modifier of space' and similarly arts practitioners or
marketers of city/music festivals and community arts projects ­ among others ­ can conceptualize
how the presentation and communication of their creative outcomes not only forms fully func-
tioning and attractive venues and settings but also in what way it has the potential to alter urban or
rural spaces. Moreover, the artistic improvisation and synergistic spirit of protesters' spatial tactics
can be infused into arts marketing practices regarding the ingenious and shared use of `physical'
space for outdoor art venues such as site-specific urban art and interactive public art. Synthetic
research approaches between the multifaceted nature of `space' (Lefebvre, [1974]1991; Soja,
1996) and `place' (Chatzidakis et al., 2014) and the complex activities of new social movements in
protest camps (Nicholls et al., 2016) offer the opportunity to expand interdisciplinary spaces where
arts (and place) marketing theorists can explore further spatial strategies for the promotion of art,
effective visibility, symbolism and emancipatory aesthetics.
Social movements seek to produce a series of campaigns and performances in order to express
common claims and form a collective identity (Tarrow, 1994; Tilly, 2004). Our findings highlight
the employment of innovative promotional activities such as the collaborative building of a visual
brand identity and unifying symbolism (yellow Umbrella), internationalization and fusions of
Western and Asian superheroes and political icons and online crowdsourcing for logo design. We
argue that Umbrella Movements' digital collective creativity and brand-building strategies evinced
a large degree of transnationalism and globalization in terms of communicating universal symbols,
language and iconic figures related to the ideals of freedom and democracy. Viewing new social
movements as alternative arts organizations and spaces, in different cultural contexts, further
research on their creative and cross-cultural `branding' practices ­ through visual/digital archives
and historical research methods ­ can provide novel insights into the increasingly aesthetic col-
laboration and technological interdependence for the promotion of common values and global
injustice symbols. Accordingly, the findings can inform and update transnational arts initiatives
and projects pursuing to promote and advance social justice and cross-cultural artistic fusion
between arts organizations that aim to forge affective bonds with global audiences.
Additionally, we suggest that the Umbrella Movement can be approached as type of an alter-
native creative organization whose temporal processes and powerful artwork can inform the
multifaceted construct of creativity for arts marketing theory (Fillis and Rentschler, 2005) and also
enlarge our understanding of managing arts organizations. We demonstrated how protesters'
courageous purposes and collective artistic expression embody the qualities of self-oriented artistic
creativity (Hirschman, 1983) and a product-centred approach towards the promotion of art. While
92 Marketing Theory 18(1)
specific art industries and entrepreneurial marketing practices permit a particular level of orga-
nizational creativity (Fillis, 2002), Umbrella Movement's lack of central leadership allowed the
proliferation of `free flowing' creativity which boosted a spirit of individual/group autonomy,
risk-taking behaviour and collective enthusiasm. In our context, movement's free-flowing
creativity ­ spread via the production and communication of protest art ­ overcame instru-
mental and traditional organizing tools, enhanced experimental artistic expression and enabled
the injection of alternative viewpoints into the public realm. Along with the study of creativity in
other contexts and fields (e.g. science and literature), urban movements and social movement
scholarship (Jasper, 2014; Shepard, 2011) can offer potential avenues of further research to arts
marketing theorists interested in horizontal leadership of arts organizations and events as well as
decentralized team or group creativity within smaller art enterprises. In-depth interviews with
protest organizers and art activists and semi-ethnographic approaches in occupied urban contexts
can explore further non-traditional forms of arts organization together with the spiralling dynamism
and contagiousness of social movements' collective and free-flowing creativity.
Apart from the inventive promotion of visual images, symbols and metaphors, our findings
showed how protesters employed the co-production of protest art and collaborative projects ­ such
as a democratic mosaic wall and interactive street painting ­ in order to enhance audience arts
engagement and foster social inclusion. Existing marketing literature has focussed on the co-
creation, and to a lesser extent co-production, of consumption experiences within artistic ser-
vice encounters (Caru
` and Cova, 2006; Minkiewicz et al., 2014) providing novel insights into the
interface between producer's service elements and consumers' emotional drivers and cognitive
engagement. Our findings identify how in open and all-inclusive urban spaces, (quasi)autonomous
groups of protesters, professional artists, locals and visitors intermingled in a collaborative artistic
process of experiencing and overtly communicating a collective sense of solidarity related to
democracy and autonomy. The accessibility of this huge creative process managed not only to
generate instructive/informative experiences about protesters' cause but also to open the move-
ment's organizational boundaries and expand its artistic vision to city dwellers, tourists and digital
audiences around the world. In this alternative context, the co-creation of protest art blurs and has
the potential to rethink the traditional roles (producer/consumer) and spatial boundaries (servi-
cescapes) of arts organizations and raise awareness of social and political issues. Additional
research on the formation of spatially complex and experimental collaborative arts projects by
social movements can inform grassroots arts groups' and local authorities' collective art activities
seeking to enhance social inclusion, strengthen community identity or promote social and envi-
ronmental issues. Furthermore, voluntary organizations and amateur arts groups can raise their
profile, attract new audiences and identify suitable outdoor venues by drawing insights from
protest art collaborative practice.
Finally, our observations focussed on Umbrella Movement's employment of the occupied space
for an arts-infused education in order to enhance equality, inclusiveness and social development,
and we suggested that during an era of arts spending cuts protest camps' `internal' education tactics
(Frenzel, 2011) can enable and inspire the emergence of cost-effective, open and non-hierarchical
learning processes and workshops. The outdoor and inventive platforms for education of audiences
demonstrate Umbrella Movement's ephemeral but resourceful efforts to foster an inclusive
learning environment and encourage a public dialogue around the necessity and means of
achieving social change. From a holistic perspective, social movements' group actions seek to
induce (Occupy Wall Street) or resist (anti-globalization movement) social change and our find-
ings indicate the employment of arts marketing practices and innovative promotion of protest art so
Patsiaouras et al. 93
as to persuade and unite the public to challenge and resist electoral reforms that threatened
democratic processes.
To date, primarily social marketing (Andreasen, 2003; Nolan and Varey, 2014) and advertising
literatures (Orazi et al., 2016; Xin and Belk, 2008) explicated the complex interactions between
marketing/advertising campaigns and social transformation pursuing to influence (voluntary)
behaviour change, improve individual or societal well-being and urge policymakers to increase
social welfare, among others. Social change, in the forward thinking and vibrant field of social
marketing, is approached, examined and enabled ­ primarily ­ through altering behaviours,
environments and policies (Gordon et al., 2016; Lefebvre, 2011). In our setting, we identified the
spontaneous creation and promotion of protest art as an essential tool of resisting controlling
political decisions and institutional power stemming from the powerful Chinese and Hong Kong
governments. Consequently, we acknowledge the role of promoted protest art as a change agent
whose value lies in the ability to highlight injustice through spatial aesthetics, audience engage-
ment and educational practices. Along with social movements and political public art projects,
marketing scholars can focus on contexts of oppression and injustice where the use of marketing
technologies and knowledge by arts communities or artists enables them to communicate a form of
art and ideas that seek to empower, educate and confront.
Concluding comments
As media scholars argue, activists and new social movements have turned into keen students of
communication strategies which enable them to engage and mobilize audiences towards col-
lective actions. In this article, we suggest that marketing theory and practice can also be
informed by the rapid growth of multi-media friendly social movements and marketing savvy
art activism. Exploring the occupied spaces of the Umbrella Movement, we identified and
discussed the presence of several marketing technologies and spatial strategies for the pro-
motion of protest art. Online crowdsourcing, visual `brand' building, co-creation of art and the
imaginative use of social media constituted some of the means that protesters utilized in order to
transform urban sites, communicate their messages, enhance audience engagement and educate
citizens. These findings can inform and update existing arts marketing studies which seek to
rethink the concepts of arts space and place identity, explore alternative forms of collective
artistic creativity and re-imagine outdoor collaborative projects for the engagement of diverse
audiences.
Future research can focus on how social movements encourage audiences to endorse social
justice, inspire meaningful actions and rethink organizational hierarchies. Additionally, the
political activities, resisting practices and promotion methods within these `alternative spaces'
can inform not only marketing theory but also the growing literature on consumer protest and the
potential of art to challenge and oppose the interests of powerful commercial or state institutions.
Protesters, consumers and activists, we argue, utilize marketing knowledge and art in order to
disrupt both the marketplace and institutional power. This process should not be viewed as an
anti-marketing phenomenon but as an invigorating stance towards the marketing concept itself
that offers the opportunity to examine and theorize the expansion of (arts) marketing activities
within unexplored social and political terrains. Consequently, further research on social
movements' efforts to effectively promote, encourage or induce social change ­ through protest
art or campaigns ­ can uncover and highlight novel aspects of the inherently creative and
political nature of marketing.
