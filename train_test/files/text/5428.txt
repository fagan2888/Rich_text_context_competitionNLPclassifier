Introduction
Self-control is important for a wide variety of consumer
behaviors and decisions. Consumers have to exercise their
capacity for self-control in order to make optimal choices,
whether it is choosing a healthy, lean green salad instead of
a scrumptious, double-layered chocolate cake; or prioritiz-
ing practicality over luxury when shopping for a product,
self-control is required in order to override impulses, over-
come temptations, and forego short-term gratifications in
favor of the more beneficial long-term goals (De Ridder
et al., 2012). However, consumers often do not exercise
self-control to warrant well-considered choices and thor-
oughly processed decisions (Bargh, 2002; Wansink and
Sobal, 2007). In a state of low self-control, consumers make
choices that offer immediate gratification that may under-
mine their long-term interests. For instance, they make more
unplanned purchases (Vohs and Faber, 2007) and buy more
unhealthy snacks impulsively (Honkanen et al., 2012).
Furthermore, while consumers' decision-making process
involves both cognition and affect, such that a virtuous
choice like a healthy choice might not always be the product
of "cold" cognition and exclusively void of affect (and vice
versa for an unhealthy choice), research appears to converge
that under low self-control consumers are typically more
swayed by affective features of a product than by cognitive
considerations (Bruyneel et al., 2006). Accordingly, in order
to circumvent such negative outcomes, an important under-
taking would be to mitigate low self-control in order to
facilitate better consumption choices that are in line with
long-term interests. However, deviating from traditional
approaches, the current research proposes to work with,
rather than against, consumer's low self-control. Earlier
work by Fennis et al. (2009) has suggested that consumers
in states of low self-control become more susceptible to
complying with marketing strategies based on influence
principles (i.e. reciprocity, liking, and consistency). In light

Abstract
Low self-control is a state in which consumers are assumed to be vulnerable to making impulsive choices that hurt long-
term goals. Rather than increasing self-control, the current research exploits the tendency for heuristic-based thinking in
low self-control by employing scarcity heuristics to promote better consumption choices. Results indicate that consumers
low in self-control especially benefited and selected more healthy choices when marketed as "scarce" (Study 1), and that
a demand (vs supply) scarcity heuristic was most effective in promoting utilitarian products (Study 2) suggests low self-
control involves both an enhanced reward orientation and increased tendency to conform to descriptive norms.

of this, in the current research, we investigate whether the
influence principle of scarcity, a classic "weapon of influ-
ence" (Cialdini, 2008) that has yet to be tested in conditions
of low self-control, can be used to guide consumers in low
self-control states toward choices that foster their long-term
interests. That is, we question whether scarcity endorsed
by marketing appeals would invariantly lead to negative
choices when self-control is low (i.e. choices that favor
immediate gratification over long-term goals). Instead, the
current research argues the opposite and aims to showcase
scarcity as a strategic tool, rather than a lethal weapon, used
in low self-control conditions to promote choices (e.g.
healthy food choices and utilitarian products with long-term
value) that would benefit consumers' long-term interests.
Through two studies, the current research first demonstrates
the influence of the general scarcity principle in low self-
control and subsequently compares the effectiveness of two
specific types of scarcity--supply scarcity versus demand
scarcity--on consumers low in self-control.
Low self-control and heuristics
A state of low self-control is proposed to occur because of
previous volitional acts of self-control (or "willpower")
depleting a single, common limited resource, and ego-
depletion has been termed to describe the phenomenon of
self-control failure due to previous exertion (Baumeister
et al., 1998). Although this conceptualization of self-con-
trol is not undisputed (Carter and McCullough, 2013;
Inzlicht and Schmeichel, 2012; Schmeichel et al., 2010),
there is considerable experimental support that exercising
self-control in an initial task results in impaired subsequent
self-control performance in a second, seemingly unrelated
task (for a review, see Hagger et al., 2010). When individu-
als are depleted and low in self-control, they tend to respond
in a more acquiescent and passive manner (Wheeler et al.,
2007), as they are also more likely to resort to easier courses
of action that are low-effort, habitual, and automatic
(Janssen et al., 2008). Considering that heuristics act as
rules-of-thumb and mental shortcuts that facilitate deci-
sion-making by reducing time, cognitive effort, and the
quantity of information to be processed (Shah and
Oppenheimer, 2008), it is not difficult to imagine why heu-
ristics are highly attractive in states of low self-control.
While previous research has shown people to increas-
ingly rely on heuristics during decision-making under low
self-control conditions (Pocheptsova et al., 2009; Pohl
et al., 2013), the current research is the first to examine
whether these findings generalize to the influence principle
of scarcity. The influence principle of scarcity is frequently
endorsed by marketers for product promotions (e.g.
"Limited Time Offer!"; "Selling out fast! Get yours now
while supplies last!"), because consumers often perceive
scarce products as more valuable than products that are
abundant (Cialdini, 2008; Verhallen and Robben, 1994). As
the limited availability of a product is considered as a cue
to the quality of the product, scarcity accordingly operates
as a heuristic (Cialdini, 2008). The current research pre-
dicts consumers low in self-control to be increasingly prone
to the effects of the scarcity heuristic. Furthermore, the cur-
rent research proposes that by working with consumers'
susceptibility to heuristic-based thinking in low self-con-
trol conditions, a scarcity heuristic could be used to pro-
mote better (i.e. long-term oriented) consumption choices.
Accordingly, in Study 1, the goal is to first demonstrate that
the effect of scarcity would be especially enhanced in states
of low self-control by testing the hypothesis that consumers
low in self-control would select more healthy food choices
if they were promoted by a scarcity heuristic emphasizing
limited availability
Nonetheless, while scarcity in general emphasizes the
limited availability of a certain product, it could be driven
by different circumstances such as supply or demand (Gierl
et al., 2008). It is important to draw the distinction between
these two types of scarcity because while both supply and
demand scarcity enhance product desirability, they operate
through different inference processes. Supply scarcity is
primarily due to short supply, for example, when a vendor
is restricting the time period that a product is available (e.g.
"Limited time offer!"). When the scarcity of a product is
conveyed through supply, consumers use this as a heuristic
inferring that the product is valuable due to its exclusivity.
In contrast, demand scarcity occurs when there is a high
amount of prior product purchases. By emphasizing that
scarcity of a product is caused by demand (e.g. "Selling out
fast! Get yours now while supplies last!"), consumers use
this as a heuristic cueing a product is particularly popular
among many others (Van Herpen et al., 2014). Study 2 spe-
cifically compares the effects of supply scarcity versus
demand scarcity in the context of low self-control condi-
tions. Intuitively, one may predict supply scarcity to be
more potent than demand scarcity due to its presumed
impact on perceived product exclusivity (Van Herpen et al.,
2014), but the reverse might actually be the case. More spe-
cifically, while the impact of supply scarcity on product
desirability seems straightforward, an early meta-analysis
(Lynn, 1991) shows only a fair effect size (r=.12), thus
suggesting that while effective, the extent to which supply
scarcity might trigger and satisfy the increased reward
sensitivity that has been shown to be associated with
conditions of low self-control (Inzlicht and Schmeichel,
2012; Schmeichel et al., 2010) might be modest. Demand
scarcity, in contrast, might prove to be particularly effective
under low self-control conditions. That is, as a heuristic,
demand scarcity suggests that the limited availability of a
product is due to its popularity among many others. This
inference may resonate well with individuals low in self-
control. Evidently, many people have chosen this product
previously, and while this may convey a high-quality
product, it might also signal something else--a descriptive
Cheung et al. 3
norm (Cialdini et al., 1991). The observation that a product
is unavailable due to popular demand suggests what is the
typical and prevalent behavior in that specific context and
critically functions as a cue to convey what is probably
attractive or immediately advantageous for the individual
(Jacobson et al., 2011). Corroborating the impact of descrip-
tive norms in a different context, in a series of studies
Jacobson et al. (2011) have indeed found compelling evi-
dence that descriptive (but not injunctive) norms proved
particularly effective in fostering conformity when people
were low in self-control. Extrapolating from these findings
to the current context, the current research therefore posits
that scarcity cues that imply a descriptive norm (i.e. demand
scarcity) should prove to be more effective than scarcity
cues without such normative information (i.e. supply scar-
city) in low self-control conditions. Hence, Study 2 tests
the hypothesis that in low self-control conditions, both a
supply scarcity heuristic and a demand scarcity heuristic
would be effective in promoting utilitarian products with
more long-term value, but that a demand scarcity heuristic
would work even better.
In summary, the current research examines the effects of
scarcity in low self-control conditions. The current research
expects consumers low in self-control to be susceptible to
the effects of scarcity in general, but that a demand scarcity
heuristic would be particularly more potent compared to a
supply scarcity heuristic. Furthermore, in light of the exist-
ing literature that typically portrays low self-control in a
negative light, in which under such a state consumers easily
succumb to "bad" temptations, the current research aims
to take advantage of low self-control conditions by employ-
ing scarcity heuristics to facilitate "better" consumption
choices that are typically not the default choice in low self-
control conditions (i.e. healthy food choices in Study 1 and
utilitarian consumer goods in Study 2). Foreshadowing our
results, the two studies in the current research reveal that
interventions could be designed to work with low self-con-
trol, and that the principle of scarcity would be a promising
and convenient strategy to promote better choices that are
in line with long-term benefits.
Study 1
Extending on the existing literature that consumers are gen-
erally sensitive to the influence of heuristics, Study 1 aims
to show that low levels of self-control would accentuate the
influence of scarcity even more.Accordingly, as a first step,
Study 1 tests the effectiveness of using scarcity as a heuris-
tic in promoting healthy food products in low self-control
conditions. Specifically, Study 1 employs a food choice
task where consumers make a choice between two products
(e.g. healthy vs unhealthy food) over a series of product
pairs. The main hypothesis is that when no heuristic is pre-
sent to promote the healthy food choices, participants low
in self-control would favor the tasty, but unhealthy food
options (i.e. opting for immediate gratification). However,
a scarcity heuristic might counter this typical low self-
control effect. In order to be more confident in attributing
the effectiveness of the scarcity heuristic exclusively to the
conditions of low self-control, Study 1 included a number
of potential covariates. Specifically, Study 1 included Need
for Cognition (NFC), which refers to the motivation for
deliberate and thoughtful thinking on a chronic level, as it
has been shown to be related to consumers'susceptibility to
peripheral cues such as heuristics in the formation of prod-
uct preferences (Haugtvedt et al. 1992). In addition, Study
1 also took into account of consumer characteristics (i.e.
frequency of purchasing food products on offer, extent to
eat healthily, and frequency of purchasing healthy food
products) that may influence participants' food choices.
Method
Participants.Participants were 67 individuals living in the
United States recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
Three participants did not indicate demographic information
including age, gender, level of education, and current
employment status. The mean age of the remaining partici-
pants was 38.02 years (SD
=
13.30), and females made up
43.8
percent of the sample. Furthermore, 1.6
percent of the
sample received no formal schooling, 17.2
percent were
educated up to high school level, 67.2
percent completed a
college or university degree, and 14
percent received post-
bachelor's education. When reporting current employment
status, 56.3percent of participants were employed for wages,
10.9
percent were self-employed, 9.4
percent were out of
work and currently looking for work, 1.6percent were out of
work and currently not looking for work, 6.3
percent were
homemakers, 7.8
percent were students, 4.7
percent were
retired, and 3.1percent were unable to work.
Design and procedure.The design of Study 1 consisted of
two independent variables, where scarcity (scarcity heuris-
tic vs no heuristic) was a within-subjects factor manipulated
in the food choice task, and self-control was a between-sub-
jects continuous predictor. The dependent variable was the
number of healthy choices made in the food choice task.
Participants were informed that they would complete
three unrelated questionnaires related to consumer prefer-
ences, but there was no explicit mentioning that they would
be first filling out the State Self-Control Scale (SSCS)
(Ciarocco et al., 2012), followed by the food choice task,
and finally the NFC Scale (Cacioppo et al., 1989) in addi-
tion to four questions that assessed consumer characteris-
tics. Upon completion of all questionnaires, participants
were thanked and received a code to confirm their partici-
pation for monetary compensation.
Food choice task.The food choice task was presented as
a marketing survey that assessed consumer preferences.
4 Health Psychology Open 
Participants were informed that they had to evaluate a series
of products presented in pairs by indicating their preferred
choice of product from each pair. In total, participants evalu-
ated 24 product pairs. Of interest were 12 food product pairs
that presented a self-control dilemma, in which a healthy
food product was paired with a tastier but relatively
unhealthy food product. To illustrate, the food pairs included
examples such as ice-cream versus Greek yogurt, salad ver-
sus pizza, cereal bar versus Oreo cookie, and donuts versus
rice crackers. Finally, the remaining 12 product pairs acted
as filler pairs that were not further analyzed.
Independent variables
Scarcity. The scarcity heuristic was conveyed with the pro-
motion tagline "Value of the week, while supplies last!"
The scarcity heuristic was presented in six of the food prod-
uct pairs in the food choice task, and it was always associ-
ated with the healthy food option. In the remaining six food
product pairs, there was no heuristic, and no information
was provided about the food products.
State self-control. State self-control was measured using the
SSCS (Ciarocco et al., 2012), which was presented as a
questionnaire on mood. Participants were asked to indicate
the degree to which they agreed (1=not true, 7=very true)
with 25 statements that described their current state such
as "I feel motivated" and "I feel like my willpower is
gone" (reverse coded) on the SSCS. A final standardized
state self-control score was calculated by averaging the
scores from all the statements, where a higher scored
reflected a higher level of state self-control. Cronbach's
alpha () of .96 reported good internal consistency for the
SSCS in this study.
Dependent variable.The dependent variable was the aver-
age number of healthy choices made from the food pairs
that had a scarcity heuristic and the food pairs that had no
heuristic in the food choice task, both ranging from 0 to 6.
Control variables. Study 1 controlled for the potential influ-
ence that the NFC, as well as the other consumer charac-
teristics, may have on the dependent variable of healthy
choices.
NFC Scale.The NFC Scale (Cacioppo et al., 1984) con-
sisted of 25 statements in which participants had to indicate
the degree to which each statement described them
(1=extremely uncharacteristic of me, 4=extremely charac-
teristic of me). Statements on the scale included examples
such as "I prefer complex to simple problems" and "I would
rather do something that requires little thought than some-
thing that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities" (reverse
coded). A final standardized NFC score was calculated by
averaging the scores from all the statements, where a higher
scored reflected a greater NFC. Cronbach's  of .94 reported
good internal consistency for the NFC Scale in this study.
Consumer characteristics.Additional questions including
(1) "How often do you purchase food products on offer or
promotion?", (2) "To what extent do you try to eat health-
ily?", and (3) "How often do you purchase healthy food
products?" were included to control for individual differ-
ences that may affect consumers'food choices. Participants
responded to these four one-time questions on a 7-point
scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The scores to
each of the three questions were standardized.
Results
Descriptives.Participants reported purchasing food prod-
ucts on offer or promotion (M=5.14, SD=1.40) relatively
frequently. Moreover, they also reported eating healthily to
a moderate extent (M=5.11, SD=1.53) and purchasing
healthy food products on a relatively frequent basis
(M=4.98, SD=1.43). Finally, participants selected an aver-
age of 5.6 healthy food products (SD
=
.21) out of the 12
food choice pairs.
Effects of a scarcity heuristic on healthy food choices.A
repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
was employed to examine the effects of a general scarcity
heuristic on participants' healthy food choices, in which
scarcity (no heuristic vs scarcity heuristic) was a within-
subjects factor and state self-control was a continuous
predictor. Furthermore, in addition to controlling for the
potential influence of NFC, consumer characteristics
including participants' extent of healthy eating (r=.57,
p<.001) and frequency of purchasing healthy food prod-
ucts (r=.45, p<.001) were included as covariates since
they were significantly correlated with the dependent
variable.
There was a significant main effect of scarcity, where
more healthy choices were made in food pairs that had a
scarcity heuristic (M=3.14, SD=1.61), compared to when
there was no heuristic (M=2.52, SD=1.19), F(1, 58)=17.37,
p<.001, 2=.23. Self-control was also a significant pre-
dictor (F(1, 58)=4.87, p=.03, 2
=
.08). Results also indi-
cated that NFC was not a significant covariate (F(1,
58)=.35, p
=
.56). Moreover, the extent to which partici-
pants try to eat healthily (F(1, 58)=14.12, p<.001, 2=.20)
had an influence on the number of healthy choices, but not
on the frequency to which participants purchase healthy
food products (F(1, 58)=.58, p=.45). Finally, as expected,
there was a significant interaction between scarcity and
self-control, F(1, 58)=8.03, p=.006, 2=.12 (Figure 1).
Parameter estimates indicate that when there was a scarcity
heuristic, the number of healthy food choices increased as
self-control levels decreased, b=-.50, t(58)=-3.11,
p
=
.03. However, self-control had no influence on the
Cheung et al. 5
outcome of healthy choices made when there was no heu-
ristic present, b=-.073, t(58)=-.53, p=.60.
Discussion
The predicted interaction with the scarcity heuristic proved
to be significant--when there was a scarcity heuristic pro-
moting the healthy food options, low self-control levels
facilitated the number of healthy choices made while con-
trolling for the effects of consumers' reported extent to
which they try to eat healthily. On the other hand, when the
scarcity heuristic was not present, results did not show evi-
dence of a negative trend between self-control and healthy
food choices. Additionally, as NFC was not a significant
covariate in our analysis, Study 1 could more confidently
rule out that the increased use of heuristic was dependent
on NFC, and that the use of the scarcity heuristic could be
attributed to low self-control.
These findings serve as first evidence that consumers low
in self-control would especially benefit from having the
installation of a scarcity in the environment to market health-
ier food choices. Nonetheless, the scarcity heuristic used in
Study 1 was ambiguous with regard to whether the scarcity
was driven by high demand or low supply (or both).As such,
while Study 1 demonstrated the influence of scarcity (in gen-
eral) in promoting healthy food choices especially in low
levels of self-control, it does not inform whether supply or
demand scarcity was driving this effect. Another shortcom-
ing of Study 1 is that due to its within-subjects design, each
food pair was only presented once with (or without) a scar-
city heuristic and not counterbalanced. Moreover, Study 1
assessed self-control using self-report measures.
Overcoming the limitations of Study 1, Study 2 pits the
two variants of scarcity directly against each other: supply
versus demand scarcity and compares their effectiveness
in the context of low self-control. Moreover, Study 2
experimentally manipulates self-control and adopts a
between-subjects design that includes a control condition
where all product pairs are presented without a heuristic
adjunct to two other experimental heuristic conditions. If
the reasoning for predictions was correct, then both sup-
ply and demand scarcity heuristics would be effective
under low self-control conditions, but we expect the
demand scarcity heuristic to exceed the effects of a supply
scarcity heuristic.
Study 2
Study 2 compares the effectiveness of the supply scarcity and
demand scarcity in promoting utilitarian products over
hedonic products, testing the hypothesis that demand scarcity
would be more effective in low self-control conditions
considering that it not only enhances product desirability but
also conveys a descriptive norm that individuals low in self-
control are highly sensitive to; whereas the supply scarcity
only infers product desirability information without confer-
ring the behavior of other people. Additionally, Study 2
examines whether the use of scarcity heuristics could extend
to promoting utilitarian products that offer long-term practi-
cal value over hedonic products that bestow short-term indul-
gence (Dhar andWertenbroch, 2000). Generally, it is expected
that participants in low self-control conditions would prefer
the attractive hedonic products with indulgent properties
unless they are accompanied by a scarcity heuristic. More
importantly, Study 2 aims to demonstrate that a demand scar-
city heuristic works better than a supply scarcity heuristic.
Method
Participants and design.A total of 165 participants were
recruited from a large university in The Netherlands. The
mean age of the participants was 21.11
years (SD=3.26).
The sample consisted exclusively of females to minimize
the potential influence of gender on product preferences.
The study used a 2 (self-control: low vs high)
×3 (heuris-
tics: no heuristic vs supply scarcity heuristic vs demand
scarcity heuristic) between-subjects design.
Procedure.The study was presented as two separate tasks,
the first being the Stroop Task employed as a self-control
manipulation and the second being a product choice task
presented as a marketing study that assessed participants'
choice between utilitarian versus hedonic products. Upon
arrival in the laboratory, participants provided informed
consent for their participation and were assigned to a cubicle
where they completed both tasks on the computer. At the
end of the experiment, participants were thanked, debriefed,
and compensated with course credit of 4 for participation.

products in the product choice task. The supply scarcity heu-
ristic was depicted by the slogan "Available only this week!"
In the demand scarcity heuristic condition, participants were
told that some products were particularly popular with par-
ticipants and were therefore low in stock. It was then pre-
sented with the slogan "Popular item, while supplies last!"
Finally, in the no heuristic condition, participants were solely
presented with product pairs without any accompanying
heuristics.
Self-control.Unlike Study 1 that measured self-control
based on self-report, Study 2 experimentally manipulated
participants' self-control levels. The Stroop Task was
employed in this study to manipulate self-control levels fol-
lowing previous research (e.g. Govorun and Payne, 2006;
Halali et al., 2014) that has also used this paradigm to
deplete participants. Participants were presented with a
series of color words (i.e. red, blue, yellow, and green) on
the computer screen; each of which was displayed in a font
color that either matched (congruent trial) or did not match
its semantic meaning (incongruent trial). Every trial began
with a fixation cross at the center of the screen (500
ms),
followed by the presentation of the color word (200
ms),
and participants had 800ms to indicate the font color of the
word by pressing the designated key on the keyboard.
All participants completed 12 practice trials in order to
familiarize themselves with the task and were then equally
distributed to either the high or low self-control condition
by randomization. In the high self-control condition, par-
ticipants performed a total of 30 congruent trials that lasted
for approximately 5minutes. In the low self-control condi-
tion, however, participants performed a total of 300 trials
divided over three blocks, where two-thirds of the trials
were incongruent trials dispersed randomly throughout the
task. In order to correctly identify the font color of the
word, participants would have to exercise self-control to
suppress the automatic and predominant response of read-
ing (i.e. Stroop effect). The length of the low self-control
condition was approximately 15minutes.
Product choice task. The product choice task was presented
as an online marketing study that assessed consumer pref-
erences. The product choice task consisted of eight product
pairs presented in a randomized order, and five out of the
eight product pairs were hedonic­utilitarian trade-off
pairs. The hedonic­utilitarian product trade-off pairs rep-
resented a self-control dilemma, as participants would
have to exercise self-control in order to forego the indulg-
ing properties of the hedonic product (e.g. make-up set)
and select the more practical but less attractive utilitarian
product (e.g. first-aid kit; Mishra and Mishra, 2011). These
product trade-off pairs were pretested, and the mean values
and SDs are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The remaining
three product pairs were filler pairs that were not further
analyzed.
Participants were asked to indicate which of the two
products they would prefer at that moment and were also
informed that it was not necessary to deliberate over the
options as the survey was only interested in consumer pref-
erences, and that there were no objective correct answers.
To increase participants' engagement in the product task,
participants were told the cover story that they would
receive one of the product choices that they selected at the
end of the experiment. The cover story was also conveyed
to increase the credibility of the scarcity heuristics--that
some products are only available this week (i.e. supply
scarcity) or that some products are low in stock because
they are especially popular with previous participants (i.e.
demand scarcity). The dependent variable was the number
of utilitarian choices made from the trade-off product pairs,
ranging from 0 to 6.
Results
Five participants who had missing data in the Stroop Task
and five other participants who performed the Stroop Task
with an accuracy of 0percent were excluded in the analy-
ses. The resulting sample in the analysis consisted of 155
participants.

In order to test the effect of self-control, heuristics,
and their interaction on the number of utilitarian products
chosen, a 2 (self-control: high vs low)
×
3 (heuristic: no
heuristic vs supply scarcity heuristic vs demand scarcity
heuristic) between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed. As expected, there was a significant main
effect of self-control on the number of utilitarian products
chosen, where participants in the high self-control condition
chose more utilitarian products (M=1.71, SD=1.23) than
participants in the low self-control condition (M=1.26,
SD=1.15), F(1, 147)=5.84, p=.02, 2=.04. The main
effect of heuristic was not significant, F(2, 147)=.12, p=.85.
Finally, the two-way interaction between self-control and
heuristics was marginally significant, F(2, 147)=2.76,
p=.06, 2=.04 (Figure 2).
In order to test the specific hypotheses regarding the
effectiveness of different scarcity heuristics, simple main
effects were examined. First, for participants high in self-
control, there were no significant differences between the
number of utilitarian products chosen across the three heu-
ristic conditions: no heuristic (M=1.85, SD=1.26), supply
scarcity heuristic (M=1.79, SD
=
1.21), and demand scar-
city heuristic (M=1.43, SD=1.25), all ps>.23. On the
other hand, results revealed that participants low in self-
control chose significantly more utilitarian products when
there was a demand scarcity heuristic (M=1.58, SD=1.29)
than when there was no heuristic present (M=.91,
SD=1.08), p=.04. The supply scarcity heuristic (M=1.17,
SD
=
.94) did not differ from the other two conditions, all
ps>.21.

Furthermore, the comparison of the number of utilitar-
ian products chosen by participants in high versus low
self-control demonstrated the typical effect of low self-
control when no heuristic was present, in which partici-
pants low in self-control (M=.91, SD=1.08) chose
significantly less utilitarian products than participants high
in self-control (M=1.85, SD=1.26), p=.007. However,
when there was a demand scarcity, no significant differ-
ence between the number of utilitarian choices made by
participants high (M=1.43, SD=1.25) or low in self-con-
trol (M=1.58, SD=1.29) was found, p=.65. Finally, a
marginally significant difference suggested that despite the
presence of a supply scarcity, participants low in self-
control (M=1.17, SD=.94) still chose less utilitarian prod-
ucts than participants with high self-control (M=1.79,
SD=1.21), p=.06.
Discussion
In Study 2, we obtained support for the hypothesis that a
demand scarcity heuristic would outperform a supply scar-
city heuristic in promoting more practical utilitarian prod-
ucts over attractive hedonic products in low self-control
conditions. Specifically, it was observed that in the low
self-control condition, participants made more utilitarian
product choices promoted by a demand scarcity heuristic,
as opposed to when no heuristic was present. Moreover, the
demand scarcity heuristic seemed to offer "protective
effects" against the pitfalls of low self-control--in the pres-
ence of demand scarcity, participants in the low self-control
condition selected just as many utilitarian choices as par-
ticipants in the high self-control condition. However, par-
ticipants low in self-control were not as receptive to the
supply scarcity heuristic that promoted the utilitarian prod-
ucts, in which they still selected fewer utilitarian products
in the low self-control condition compared to the high self-
control condition.
The finding in Study 2 that the demand scarcity heuris-
tic was more influential supports previous finding that
individuals low in self-control tend to conform with
descriptive norms (Jacobson et al. 2011). This serves as a
reminder that perhaps while all heuristics generally func-
tion as decisional shortcuts, the way they operate is not
the same, at least in the context of low self-control condi-
tions. As such, the degree of the effectiveness of different
heuristics should not be assumed to be equal without con-
sidering the context that they are performing in, and con-
sumers low in self-control may ultimately benefit more
from certain heuristics (e.g. demand scarcity heuristic)
than from others.
General discussion
This study explored the potential of using scarcity heuristics
to promote healthy food choices and utilitarian products
with long-term benefits for consumers lacking self-control
who would generally opt out for alternatives with short-term
gratification. The current research demonstrated that by
measuring state levels of self-control (Study 1) and experi-
mentally manipulating self-control (Study 2), consumers
low in self-control benefited from having scarcity heuristics
guide their decisions toward more optimal choices. Study 1
found that lower levels of self-control actually increased
consumers' choices for healthy food choices in the presence
of scarcity. Building off this finding, Study 2 distinguishes
between the demand scarcity heuristic and the supply scar-
city heuristic by comparing their effectiveness in promoting
utilitarian choices, in which results indicated the superiority
of the former in low self-control conditions. Our finding that
the demand scarcity heuristic was more influential in low
self-control conditions is in line with the notion that low
self-control is associated with increased reward sensitivity
(Inzlicht and Schmeichel, 2012; Schmeichel et al., 2010) but
also corroborates previous research that has found individu-
als low in self-control to favor and conform to descriptive
norms (Jacobson et al., 2011). Although Experiment 1 pre-
sented food choices whereas Experiment 2 presented generic
consumer goods, the similar pattern of results observed in
both studies thereby reveals the robustness of the effect of
low self-control leading to a "virtuous" choice given that it
ispromotedbyanappropriatescarcityheuristic.Nonetheless,
given the importance of health promotion in the current
obesogenic environment, we particularly welcome future
studies to replicate and extend on our current research to
further examine and validate the effectiveness of scarcity
heuristics to promote healthy food choices. Specially, our
finding that the demand scarcity heuristic was more influ-
ential also dovetails the recent study by Salmon et al.
(2014) who showed that people low in self-control were
much more likely to base their food choices on the sugges-
tion of a descriptive norm (i.e. a pie chart showing the
behavior of the majority of previous participants making a
healthy choice) that acted as a social proof heuristic.
Correspondingly, it may be that the demand scarcity heuris-
tic similarly provides a social proof mechanism. In light of
this, it would be interesting to question whether the social
information conveyed by these particular heuristics (i.e.
demand scarcity heuristic, social proof heuristic) might be
the key ingredient to its success. As such, future research
could shed insight by comparing heuristics that contain a
social component (e.g. authority, reciprocity) with heuristics
that only convey an exemplar without any social aspect (e.g.
availability, recognition). Moreover, future effort should
more stringently consider how to optimally design and max-
imize the effectiveness of heuristics in low self-control con-
ditions. In the case of scarcity heuristics, it is critical to
ensure that scarcity information offers believability (e.g. is
the scarcity understood and perceived to be legitimate?),
choice (e.g. do people still feel a sense of freedom to choice
without feeling threatened or coerced?), and alternatives
(e.g. do they need it? Are there substitutes?) (Mortensen and
Cheung et al. 9
Allen, 2013). If these criteria are not met, there is a chance
that the heuristic will backfire and induce the opposite
desired effects.
While there is a positive outlook regarding the usefulness
of heuristics, it should nonetheless be acknowledged that the
currentresearchreliedonlyonhypotheticalchoices(although
Study 2 attempted to simulate a real product choice task and
increase participant engagement by informing participants
that they would receive one of the product choices they
make). Similarly, in real-life contexts, price is an important
determinant of purchase decisions and as such in considering
consumers'choices, future research should take into account
how socio-economic factors might interact with behavioral
factors such as the ones showcased in this study. For one, it
would be important to include broader samples of individu-
als with diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Furthermore,
it has been criticized that the dichotomy of consumption
choices, prevalently applied to food choices where "healthy"
is considered the good choice and the "unhealthy" alterna-
tive is considered the bad choice, is misleading since there is
and should be much uncertainty in what defines "good" food
and"bad"foodinrelationtohealthandwellbeing(Askegaard
et al., 2014). As such, to improve and extend on the current
research, it is recommended that future studies expand the
list of choice outcomes from one-off dichotomized choices
to more comprehensive measures such as options from an
entire meal (menus), food diaries recorded over time spans,
and shopping lists that resemble more closely with real-life
and naturalistic settings. Employing such measures rather
than relying on one-off binary choice outcomes not only
increases ecological validity but also allows for directing
focus on moderation and the balance of choices, which are
crucial for health and wellbeing.
Having to process considerable amounts of information
and make countless decisions on a daily basis, consumers
often rely on heuristics to help them to think in ways that are
quickandeasy(Kahnemanetal.,1982;ToddandGigerenzer,
2007), while heuristic-based thinking is execrated when
self-control levels are low (Pocheptsova et al., 2009).
It is no coincidence that marketing campaigns frequently
endorse heuristic principles to entice consumers into buying
products to increase profit. However, the first implication of
the current research is that the same factors (e.g. low self-
control) that lead consumers to making an impulsive or sub-
optimal choice could be reversed into an impulsive but
virtuous choice. Indeed, the current research exploited low
self-control conditions and employed conventional market-
ing tactics that endorse scarcity heuristics in promoting "vir-
tuous" product choices that would support consumers'
long-term interests. This approach deviates from traditional
interventions that focus on increasing self-control and
instead showcases low self-control as a state that could be
favorable to consumer welfare. Consumers low in self-con-
trol would indeed make the "right" choice in line with long-
term interests if the choice setting offers suitable heuristics
promoting them. As Study 1 showed, simply associating
healthy food products with scarcity led to more healthy
choices made by consumers low in self-control. This strat-
egy could be easily extrapolated from an experimental set-
ting and be implemented as in-store ads or displays as part
of health promotion campaigns aimed at healthy eating.
Nonetheless, critical to underscore is that certain heuristics
may be more suitable in low self-control conditions. The
observation in Study 2 that the demand scarcity heuristic
performed best overall puts forth an additional implication.
It appears that using limited availability to emphasize prod-
uct value and presenting a descriptive norm as a social proof
component to attest to its value may be important ingredi-
ents for the successful promotion of virtuous consumption
choices in low self-control conditions. That is, when con-
sumers are seeking to buy a utilitarian product, for example,
the demand scarcity acts as a heuristic for consumers to
form an accurate judgment of product performance through
social proof information (e.g. the probability that so many
buyers would purchase a bad product would be unlikely;
Ku et al., 2013).
Deviating from traditional approaches that target at rais-
ing self-control, our strategy of working with low self-con-
trol conditions through the use of scarcity heuristics lends
itself as a promising tactic that could be publicly imple-
mented on a large scale to promote consumer welfare.
Importantly, the use of scarcity heuristics to promote
healthy food products or utilitarian consumer goods (with-
out forbidding their alternatives) aligns well with the call
for optimizing choice architectures to encourage more opti-
mal consumption choices (Johnson et al., 2012).
Conclusion
The current research began by asking whether following
scarcity heuristics endorsed by advertising appeals would
invariantly lead consumers into choices that mainly benefit
the interests of the marketeer rather than the wellbeing of
the consumers. By working with low self-control conditions
that facilitate heuristic-based thinking, which is typically seen
as a vice that inevitably leads to suboptimal choices, the cur-
rent research found that the influence principle of scarcity
was able to promote better consumption choices that would
benefit consumers'long-term interests. In this light, low self-
control is not necessarily a state that should be avoided, and
that scarcity could also be employed as a strategic tool, rather
than a weapon of influence, in promoting better consumption
choices for consumers low in self-control. Nonetheless, as
some tools are sharper than others, our findings also indicate
the demand scarcity heuristic, which highlights reward
emphasis and provides descriptive norm information, to be
more effective than the supply scarcity heuristic in promoting
utilitarian consumer goods in the context of low self-control.
