MANY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFI-
cials and organizations
have tried to warn the
public about the dan-
gers of obesity.1,2 One of the strongest
warnings came from the US surgeon
General who stated that a failure to ad-
dress overweight and obesity "could
wipe out some of the gains we've made
in areas such as heart disease, several
forms of cancer, and other chronic
health problems."3
For a health message to be effective,
it should be both understood by the re-
cipient and the information should be
perceived as relevant.4 In trying to con-
vey the magnitude of the deleterious ef-
fects of obesity, investigators have pre-
sented information on the health care
costs due to obesity,5 the relative mor-
tality rates among obese vs nonobese
persons,6 and the number of annual
deaths that might be attributable to obe-
sity.7 These messages may not be effec-
tive for individuals in the United States,
who may be less interested in popula-
tion-level effects. One way to quantify
the individual effect is in terms of the
expected number of years of life lost
(YLL). The YLL is defined as the dif-
ference between the number of years a
person would be expected to live if he/
she was not obese and the number of
years expected to live if the person were
obese.
To our knowledge, only 1 study has
attempted to calculate YLL estimates
due to obesity. Stevens et al8 found that
YLL estimates were greater for older
than younger obese individuals. This
seems counterintuitive and may be the
result of the investigators restricting
their analysis to a 12-year period rather
than estimating YLL across the remain-
ing life span. This may have led to
marked underestimation of YLL and
may have created a spurious positive
correlation between baseline age and
YLL. Therefore, we conducted a study
estimating YLL across the entire life
span to provide meaningful values.
METHODS
Method of Calculation
The YLL due to obesity can be esti-
mated by combining 3 types of infor-
mation1: an estimate of the distribution
of body mass index (BMI) for each year

Context Public health officials and organizations have disseminated health mes-
sages regarding the dangers of obesity, but these have not produced the desired effect.
Objective To estimate the expected number of years of life lost (YLL) due to over-
weight and obesity across the life span of an adult.
Design, Setting, and Subjects Data from the (1) US Life Tables (1999); (2) Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994); and (3)
First National Health and Nutrition Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHANES I and II;
1971-1992) and NHANES II Mortality Study (1976-1992) were used to derive YLL
estimates for adults aged 18 to 85 years. Body mass index (BMI) integer-defined cat-
egories were used (ie, 17; 17 to 18; 18 to 19; 20 to 21; 21 to 45; or 45). A
BMI of 24 was used as the reference category.
Main Outcome Measure The difference between the number of years of life ex-
pected if an individual were obese vs not obese, which was designated YLL.
Results Marked race and sex differences were observed in estimated YLL. Among
whites, a J- or U-shaped association was found between overweight or obesity and
YLL. The optimal BMI (associated with the least YLL or greatest longevity) is approxi-
mately 23 to 25 for whites and 23 to 30 for blacks. For any given degree of over-
weight, younger adults generally had greater YLL than did older adults. The maxi-
mum YLL for white men aged 20 to 30 years with a severe level of obesity (BMI 45)
is 13 and is 8 for white women. For men, this could represent a 22% reduction in ex-
pected remaining life span. Among black men and black women older than 60 years,
overweight and moderate obesity were generally not associated with an increased YLL
and only severe obesity resulted in YLL. However, blacks at younger ages with severe
levels of obesity had a maximum YLL of 20 for men and 5 for women.
Conclusion Obesity appears to lessen life expectancy markedly, especially among
younger adults.

BMI Distribution
We derived population-based data on
BMI distribution from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III). NHANES
IIIcollectsinformationabouthealthand
diet in a representative sample of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US popu-
lation. This survey also estimates the
prevalence of a variety of health con-
ditions and risk factors, such as obe-
sity. NHANES combines a home inter-
view with health tests, which are
performed in a mobile examination cen-
ter. NHANES III has been described in
detail elsewhere.9,10 In brief, NHANES
III represents a 6-year study, involv-
ing two 3-year phases, conducted from
1988 to 1994. The data used to derive
estimates of the population-based BMI
distribution are from both phases of the
NHANES III data collection. Mexican
Americans, non-Hispanic blacks, and
older adults were oversampled in
NHANES III to ensure weighted, un-
biased estimates from these particular
groups. Herein, only black and white
subjects were used because sample
sizes of other groups were generally in-
sufficient to allow reasonably precise
estimates.
Body mass index was divided into or-
dered, nonoverlapping categories start-
ing with less than 17 (ie, 17 to 18; 18
to 19; 20 to 21; 21 to 45; or 45).
Second, for each race and sex group, the
proportion of individuals within each
BMI category was estimated. The pro-
portions were calculated using a
smoothing procedure based on mov-
ing averages. This procedure was nec-
essary because continuous scales made
categorical with fine gradations may re-
sult in insufficient data to produce pre-
cise estimates. Smoothing is a nonpara-
metric way to minimize this problem.
Specifically, we first estimated the prob-
ability of being in each of a series of 34
overlapping BMI intervals starting with
the interval BMI of less than 17, then
progressing through BMI intervals with
widths of 5 (13 to 18; 14 to 19;
44 to 49; and the open interval of
45). For each interval, we assigned
subjects a score of 1 if their observed
BMI was within the interval and zero
if it was not. This resulted in 34 bi-
nary variables. Each of these binary vari-
ables was then regressed on age to a
third-degree polynomial via logistic re-
gression.
We chose a model with a cubic poly-
nomial because past research, which in-
cluded the NHANES I data, showed that
(over the adult life span) the change in
BMI with age is convex and can be well
characterized by a third-degree poly-
nomial or less.11 Using the resulting lo-
gistic regression equations, the prob-
ability of being in each of these broad
intervals was calculated for each age
from 18 to 85 years. Then, within each
age, the probability of being in each in-
teger-defined BMI category was calcu-
lated as the moving average of all the
broader BMI bins containing the inte-
ger-defined BMI category of interest.
These smoothed proportions were used
to represent the probability of being in
a given BMI category at each age.
Third, also using NHANES III data,
we estimated the mean BMI within each
BMI category for each race and sex
group. This was simply estimated as the
observed arithmetic mean within each
sex by race by BMI category grouping.
The HR for BMI Levels
in Each Year of Adult Life
To estimate the HR for death at a
given BMI level in each year of adult
life, we combined data from the First
National Health and Nutrition Epide-
miologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)
and the NHANES II Mortality Study
(NH2MS).12
The NHEFS is a national longitudinal
studythatwasdesignedtoinvestigatethe
relationships between clinical, nutri-
tional,andbehavioralfactorsassessedin
NHANES I and II and subsequent mor-
bidity,mortality,andhospitaluse,aswell
aschangesinriskfactors,functionallimi-
tation, and institutionalization.12 The
NHEFS includes all persons aged 25 to
74yearswhocompletedamedicalexami-
nation during NHANES I from 1971 to
1975 (n=14407). Follow-up vital sta-
tistics were collected through 1992. Of
all the participants, 96% have been suc-
cessfully traced at some point through
follow-up in 1992.12
The NH2MS cohort is composed of
adults who were aged 30 to 75 years at
the time of their NHANES II examina-
tion between 1976 and 1980 (n=9252).
Two participants were unable to be fol-
lowed-up because of incomplete per-
sonal identifying data and are consid-
ered lost to follow-up. The NH2MS
cohort members were tracked through
1992 by searching national databases
containing mortality and cause-of-
death information. The 2 datasets were
combined to increase sample size and
precision of estimates.
Usingthesedata,Coxregressionmod-
els were used with mortality as the out-
come and BMI, BMI2, age, age2, and their
interaction terms as covariates. Poten-
tial age, race, and sex interactions were
accounted for by fitting separate mod-
els to each race and sex group. Interac-
tions of BMI and BMI2 with age2 were
not used because prior research indi-
cated that change in the BMI param-
eters appears to be roughly linear in
age.13 In addition, removal of such terms
greatlyreducedcollinearity.Despitethis,
there may be some collinearity, particu-
larly among variables such as age and
age2. However, this is not a major con-
cern in this situation because collinear-
ity will increase the variance of the co-
efficients,butwillnotbiastheparameter
estimatesortheoverallpredictions.Prior
to estimating the Cox regression model,
BMI was transformed to BMI inverse
(1/BMI). We chose inverted BMI as a
predictor instead of BMI because prior
research has shown that inverted BMI
is more suitable for modeling the con-
vex but asymmetrical relationship be-

tween BMI and mortality.14,15 Within ev-
ery sex and age group examined in
NHANES III, inverted BMI was more
highly correlated with body fat than was
BMI.16 Smoking status (defined as cur-
rent, former, never, or unknown) was
controlled for in all analyses. Using the
resulting equation, we calculated the es-
timated HR for each BMI category at
each age interval by substituting the
mean BMI in each BMI category for the
BMI in the equation and the midpoint
of the age interval (eg, 18.5 for 18- to
19-year-olds) for age in the equation. As
a sensitivity analysis, we also calcu-
lated the estimated HRs across the cat-
egories of BMI using the sample weights
that account for the complex sampling
design of NHEFS and NH2MS. These
weightedestimateswereextremelysimi-
lar to the unweighted estimates and
when they differed, the HRs for obesity
were higher with than without weight-
ing, suggesting that our results may be
conservative.
To test the proportionality assump-
tion, Schoenfeld residuals were com-
puted for each variable in the model.
When the proportionality assumption is
met, Schoenfeld residuals should be in-
dependent of survival time. Therefore,
we plotted these residuals against sur-
vival time for each independent vari-
able involving BMI (ie, BMI; BMI2;
BMIage; BMI2age) and also com-
putedthatSpearmannonparametriccor-
relation between these residuals and
survival time. This was performed sepa-
rately for each of the 4 sex and race
groups. In each group, all 4 plots gave
no indication of a nonrandom pattern
of association. Moreover, across all 4
variables in all 4 groups, the largest
Spearman r2 for the correlation with
survival time was less than 0.5% of the
variance. Thus, there is substantial evi-
dence for the validity of the proportion-
ality assumption. All logistic regres-

Life Tables
The life table for the total population
of the United States in 1999 was used
to derive information on the probabil-
ity of death during each year of life
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr
/nvsr50/nvsr50_06.pdf). For each race-
and sex-specific age interval, we ob-
tained an estimate of the total prob-
ability of death within the interval,
which was conditional on having lived
to the start of that interval.
Estimate of YLL
Using data from the (1) US Life Tables
(1999); (2) Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANESIII;1988-1994);and(3)First
National Health and Nutrition Epide-
miologic Follow-up Study (NHANES I
and II; 1971-1992) and NHANES II
Mortality Study (1976-1992), we were
able, for each age interval, in each of 4
race and sex groups, to obtain an esti-
mate of the probability of death within
the interval, which was conditional on
having lived to the start of that inter-
val and being in the first BMI cat-
egory. The probability of death within
the interval conditional on having lived
to the start of that interval and being
in a given BMI category was also esti-
mated. For a person of a given age in a
given BMI category, we estimated their
expected age of death (operationally de-
fined as the median age of death for a
person with their starting age and BMI).
Finally, the YLL for a person of a given
age in a given BMI category is the dif-
ference relative to being in the refer-
ence category (ie, BMI=24). A BMI of
24 was chosen as the reference cat-
egory because it represents the upper
bound of desirable weight.
RESULTS
The YLL due to obesity estimates for
each sex and race group (compared
with a BMI of 24) for ages 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, and 70 years are displayed in
FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2. A complete
tabulation of the YLL estimates across
the entire range of BMI is posted on our
Web site (http://www.soph.uab.edu
/statgenetics/Research/Tables/YLL
.htm). Among whites, the overall
pattern suggests a J- or U-shaped asso-
ciation. For example, YLL would be
1 to 9 in individuals with low BMIs
(17 to 19) and 9 to 13 in individuals
with high BMIs (35). White men aged
20 years with BMIs greater than 45 are
estimated to have 13 YLL relative to
white men aged 20 years with BMIs of
24. A similar, although less pro-
nounced pattern occurs throughout the
upper range of BMI (Figure 1). Among
white women, the pattern shows less
variability across the range of BMI dis-
tribution as a function of age. White
women aged 20 to 30 years with BMIs
greater than 45 are estimated to have
8 YLL due to obesity (Figure 1).
The overall pattern of findings among
blacks was somewhat different. Among
black men, estimated YLL due to obe-
sity did not begin for any age group un-
til a BMI of 32 was reached. Obesity ap-
peared to be associated with a slightly
increased life expectancy across much
of the moderate obesity range for the
older age groups (60-70 years). Twenty
was the maximum YLL found among
black men aged 20 years with BMIs
greater than 45 (Figure 2). The maxi-
mum YLL for black women aged 20
years with BMIs greater than 45 was 5
(Figure 2).
COMMENT
Using 1999 US Life Tables and popula-
tion-baseddatatoderiveestimatesofthe
BMI distribution for each year of adult
life, as well as the HR for death for each
BMI category in each year of adult life,
we found that obesity has a profound
effect on life span. That is, mirroring the
association between BMI and mortal-
ity, a J- or U-shaped association be-
tween BMI and YLL at all ages was ob-
served. Moreover, the optimal BMI (ie,
the BMI associated with the greatest lon-
gevity) for adults aged 18 to 85 years is
approximately 23 to 25 for whites and
approximately 23 to 30 for blacks.
A 20-year-old white male with a BMI
greater than 45 is estimated to have 13
YLL due to obesity. Assuming a life ex-
pectancy of 78 years, this translates into
a 17% reduction in total life expec-
tancy. When one considers that a 20-
year-old white male is expected to live
another 58 years, a 13-year reduction

due to obesity actually represents a 22%
reduction in remaining years of life.
White women aged 20 years with BMIs
greater than 45 are estimated to have 8
YLL due to obesity, which is a 10% re-
duction in total life expectancy. Assum-
ing 61 years of life remaining for a 20-
year-old woman, an 8-year reduction
due to obesity actually represents a 13%
reduction in remaining years of life.
Thus, our findings suggest that obesity
has a marked effect on the life span of
whites,andthattheriskofincreasedYLL
was greatest at younger ages.
The pattern of findings among blacks
was somewhat different. Obesity was as-
sociated with only slightly increased life
expectancy across much of the over-
weight and moderate obesity range for
most age groups. A consistent reduc-
tion in expected life expectancy was not
observed until BMIs of 37 to 38 for
women and 32 to 33 for men were
reached. The maximum YLL was 20
among black men aged 20 years with
BMIs greater than 45. This is a 29% re-
duction based on a life expectancy of
70 years and a 40% reduction in re-
maining years of life. Given the small
sample size of black men with ex-
tremely high BMIs, it is worth consid-
ering the more conservative estimate
obtained among black men with BMIs
of 44 to 45. For these 20-year-olds, the
YLL was 11, which is a 16% reduction
in total life expectancy and a 22% re-
duction in remaining years of life.
Among black women aged 20 years
with BMIs greater than 45, the YLL was
5, which is a 6.6% reduction in total life
expectancy of 76 years and an 8.9% re-
duction in remaining years of life. De-
spite the different pattern of findings
from whites, we also observed that YLL
were greatest at younger ages.
In one respect, our findings run
counter to those reported by Stevens et
al8 in that the YLL attributable to obe-
sity increased with age, but declined for
those in the oldest decade (70-79 years).
A possible explanation for the diver-
gent findings is that we estimated YLL
across the remaining years of life while
Stevens et al restricted the analyses to
a 12-year period using data from the
Cancer Prevention Study I. This ap-
proach may have led to both an under-
estimation of YLL and a spurious posi-
tive association between baseline age
and YLL. This is because the method
of estimating YLL used by Stevens et al
defined the observed YLL to be zero for
all subjects who did not die within the
duration of the study. This results in an
overall underestimation of YLL be-
cause those individuals who will die be-
fore the median life span for their de-
mographic group (ie, would have an
YLL 0), but did not die during the
study, are coded as YLL=0. Moreover,
younger individuals (independent of
BMI) are less likely to die than older
people within any defined period. This
presumption results in a greater un-
derestimation for younger rather than
older individuals and potentially leads
to a spurious positive correlation be-
tween YLL and age. Our YLL esti-

mates also seem markedly higher than
those obtained by Stevens et al who con-
sidered all levels of obesity as a single
class (ie, BMI 30) so the results are
not easily compared directly with ours.
Nevertheless, the YLL associated with
obesity did not exceed 1 for any age or
sex group considered.
There was some difference in the pat-
tern of findings in YLL due to obesity
between whites and blacks. This is ac-
tually consistent with what has been ob-
served regarding the association be-
tween BMI and mortality between these
races.17 For example, in a cohort of 2731
black women who were members of the
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and
were followed-up for 15 years, Wien-
pahl et al18 found an essentially flat as-
sociation between BMI and mortality
across the entire range of BMI. Other
investigators19-22 have obtained simi-
lar results, which suggests that the effect
of a given BMI increase on mortality rate
may be different and sometimes less del-
eterious among blacks relative to
whites.
A recent review17 of the literature on
the association between BMI and mor-
tality in blacks indicates that obesity re-
sulted in a smaller increase in mortal-
ity among blacks compared with whites.
Using data from the Cancer Preven-
tion Study II, a J- or U-shaped pattern
between BMI and relative rates of mor-
tality among whites was obtained. In
contrast, the pattern among black men
and women suggests that the only cat-
egory in which the relative mortality
rate is consistently and substantially el-
evated is among black women with
BMIs of less than 18.5.
At least 4 possible explanations may
account for the differential relation-
ship between moderately high levels of
BMI, mortality, and YLL across races.
First, the true causal effect of BMI on
mortality rate may differ between blacks
and whites. Second, blacks and whites
may be exposed to different compet-
ing risks for mortality and this may

affect the outcome.23 That is, distribu-
tions of age, health status, socioeco-
nomic status, and other variables that
can affect mortality rate may differ by
race and this can affect the estimated
HR which, in turn, influences the YLL
estimates. For example, homicide is the
leading cause of death among blacks
aged 15 to 34 years, and the third lead-
ing cause of potential YLL.24 Thus, it is
possiblethathomicides,acauseofdeath
presumably independent of BMI, may
disproportionately account for excess
deaths among blacks, particularly
males, thereby altering the influence of
obesity on YLL estimates. Third, there
may be different distributions of con-
founding variables among blacks com-
pared with whites. Fourth, the critical
variable may be body composition, not
BMI, and the relationship between me-
tabolism, BMI, and body composition
(central adiposity) may differ by race,
especially among women.25,26 These 4
potential explanations are neither mu-
tually exclusive nor exhaustive.
We also observed some sex differ-
ences in the association between obe-
sity and YLL. On the whole, indepen-
dent of race, men were at increased YLL
risk. Among white men, the increased
YLL risk was generally more uniform
across age than it was for white women.
This is consistent with Stevens et al,8
who also found that YLL was higher
among men than women with compa-
rable BMIs.
The results of this study should be in-
terpreted in light of several limitations.
AlthoughelevatedBMIistheprimaryin-
dex of obesity used in most studies, it is
a proxy of adiposity and may not pro-
vide the best estimate of the association
between obesity and outcomes such as
mortality or YLL. Body mass index in-
volves fat mass and fat-free mass, so its
usemaymaskanydifferentialhealthcon-
sequences associated with fat mass and
fat-free mass,27-30 which suggests that fu-
ture studies should obtain not only BMI,
but direct measures of body composi-
tion as well.
Due to insufficient sample size, the
association between obesity and YLL
could not be reliably estimated for other
racial/ethnic groups, including Mexi-
can-Americans and Pacific-Islander
Americans, groups that are known to
have high prevalences of overweight
and obesity. Until databases of suffi-
cient size are available for these racial
groups, the association between BMI
and YLL will remain unknown.
A related issue concerns the rela-
tively small sample size of individuals in
the upper BMI categories. We chose to
collapse the upper BMI categories at 45
or greater, as opposed to some other cut
point because of the increasing propor-
tion of individuals with BMIs above 40
andthemarkedlyacceleratedincreasein
mortality rate for individuals with high
BMI levels.31,32 To address whether the
relative sparseness of data in the upper
BMI categories may have rendered YLL
estimates imprecise, we reversed the or-
der of the pi's for the upper BMI catego-
ries for white men and black women to
evaluate the extent to which this influ-
encedYLLestimates.Lessthan1%ofthe
YLL estimates for white men in the up-
per BMI categories were altered, and in
allof these cases, the changes were mini-
mal(ie,Â±1year).Forblackwomen,there
weremorechanges(approximately8%),
but the magnitude of these changes on
YLL estimates were small (Â±1 year).
Thus, although sample sizes in the up-
per BMI categories were modest, our re-
sultsappeartobequiterobusttoanymis-
estimation of the frequency distribution
of BMI at the upper end of the BMI con-
tinuum.
Although an estimate of YLL due to
obesity is interesting and important, it
is only 1 consequence of obesity. A re-
cent review33 indicates that obesity sig-
nificantly impairs quality of life, argu-
ably a more potent marker of the effect
of obesity because quality-of-life defi-
cits are experienced in the moment
rather than anticipated sometime in the
future.
We controlled for smoking status as
a potential confounder of the associa-
tion between BMI and YLL. Specifi-
cally, we categorized individuals as cur-
rent, former, or never smokers, and
unknown. The number of cigarettes
smoked was not taken into account be-
cause of the limitation of the data. We
also did not consider that changes in
smoking prevalence are occurring over
time. Given that smoking affects both
bodyweightandmortalityrate,thismay
affect the YLL associated with obesity
at future time points. Thus, future re-
searchers may wish to reestimate YLL
values at periodic intervals to see if
changes occur.
We also did not control for the pos-
sible confounding effects of subclini-
cal or occult disease. This is because it
is unclear exactly how to control for
something that is, by definition, unob-
servable. Excluding individuals who
died early in follow-up (eg, 5 years)
to reduce confounding due to preex-
istingdiseasehasbeenshowntobeinef-
fective and possibly even exacerbat-
ing.28,29,34 Nonetheless, within the
contextofBMIandYLLstudies,itispos-
sible that preexisting occult disease
couldconfoundtheassociationbetween
BMI and YLL and lead spuriously to a
diminution in the observed increase in
YLL across the upper range of BMI. To
the extent that confounding due to
occult disease exists, our YLL esti-
mates are likely to be underestimates.
Our YLL calculations assume that an
individual'sBMIremainsconstantacross
age. We sought to address the ques-
tion: Given that an individual has a BMI
of 37, for example, how much longer
would he/she be expected to live if the
BMI was 24? This is different than ad-
dressing the question: Given that an in-
dividual has a BMI of 37, for example,
andgainsorlosesweightatthesamerate
as others with BMIs of 37, for example,
how much longer would he/she be ex-
pected to live if the BMI was 24 and
gained or lost weight at the same rate as
others with BMIs of 24? The former
question is more germane to public
health and clinical communication.
Given that we used information from
3 separate and different data sets in our
calculation procedure, we were un-
able to provide confidence intervals for
our YLL estimates. We are unaware of
any developed analytic formula that
would allow easy calculation of SEs and
confidence intervals. Computer-

intensive sampling procedures could be
used, but that is a topic for future re-
search. It is likely that our YLL esti-
mates will be least precise when there
is less data such as among blacks and
among extremely obese individuals.
Finally, we did not determine statis-
tical power a priori. Although, given our
sample size, this is not a limitation per
se for most of our analyses, it should
be noted that as one moves to the ex-
tremes of the distribution of predictor
variables under study, fewer data are
available and estimates become less
stable, and the HRs can substantially in-
fluence estimates of YLL. Therefore, it
will be useful for future research to rep-
licate and refine the results herein us-
ing larger data sets, particularly among
nonwhites.
There are also several strengths of the
study. We used large nationally repre-
sentative samples to derive our esti-
mates of BMI distribution and HR of
death across the life span. We also used
an analytic approach that generated YLL
estimates for each remaining year of life
along the range of BMI. Moreover, our
YLL estimates are likely conservative
because we did not exclude cohort
members (eg, ever smokers, weight
fluctuators).
Our results confirm that obesity is a
majorpublichealthproblemthatappears
tolessenlifeexpectancymarkedly,espe-
cially among individuals in younger age
groups. Among blacks, the pattern of
findings suggests that overweight and
obesity may not decrease life expec-
tancy until a BMI of approximately 32
to 33 for men and 37 to 38 for women is
reached. At these BMI levels, longevity
