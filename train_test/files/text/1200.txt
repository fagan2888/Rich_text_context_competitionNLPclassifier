Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 38, No. 5, pp. 826­832, 2006. Purpose and Methods: Leisure physical activity was assessed using
questionnaires with different time frames in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) cohort of 3234 overweight individuals aged > 25
yr with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) from 27 centers across the United States. The three questionnaires were the Modifiable
Activity Questionnaire (MAQ; past year), the Low-Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR; past 7 d), and the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; past month). This provided the opportunity to examine the relationship between the
three activity measures and to compare activity levels of the DPP sample with that of a national sample with IGT. Results: Leisure
activity determined by the three questionnaires significantly correlated with each other, although the correlations between MAQ and
NHANES III were stronger (men: rho = 0.52; women: rho = 0.49; P G 0.01) than between LOPAR and either measure (men: rho =
0.20 for MAQ, 0.24 for NHANES; women: rho = 0.10 for MAQ, 0.13 for NHANES). In the DPP, measures of obesity and glucose
tolerance were significantly correlated with activity levels determined by MAQ and NHANES, but not LOPAR. Activity levels in
DPP participants determined by the NHANES III questionnaire were generally higher than those reported by individuals meeting DPP
eligibility criteria who were part of the NHANES cohort for similar age, body mass index, and race or ethnicity. Conclusion: If the
DPP participants were more active than a national sample of individuals with IGT, this would have implications for translation when
using the DPP lifestyle intervention in less active or less motivated populations. Finally, the weak relationship between activity levels
obtained with MAQ and LOPAR may result from the fact that they encompass different time frames and different components of
leisure activity. Key Words: DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2, EXERCISE, OBESITY IN DIABETES, QUESTIONNAIRES,
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a
randomized clinical trial of diabetes prevention in
3234 overweight individuals aged Q 25 yr with
elevated fasting glucose levels and impaired glucose toler-
ance (27). The study was designed to determine whether a
diet and exercise lifestyle intervention or treatment with
metformin would delay the onset of diabetes in a hetero-
geneous group of individuals from 27 centers across the
United States. Of the participants enrolled in the DPP, 45%
were from ethnic or racial groups that suffer disproportion-
ately from type 2 diabetes, including African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islan-
ders, and American Indians. Participants were aged 25 yr
and older, providing diversity of individuals by age as well.
Self-reported levels of leisure physical activity were
assessed at baseline in the entire DPP cohort using
physical activity questionnaires with three different time
frames (8,10,11,16,20). One of these questionnaires, the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), was also administered to a national U.S.
sample, a subgroup of which had impaired glucose
tolerance (16). The time frame of these three activity
assessment tools varied from the past week to the past year.
Given the success of the lifestyle arm of the DPP (5), it
would be valuable to compare the DPP cohort with a
national sample to better understand the generalizability of
the DPP results. In addition, because (a) the physical
activity questionnaires obtained at baseline in the DPP
cohort assessed activity over different time frames and (b)
the DPP population was highly diverse in regard to age,
gender, race, and geographic location, it would be

interesting to compare questionnaire results. Therefore, the
purposes of this study were twofold: (a) to examine the
magnitude of the correlations among reported physical
activity levels in the DPP participants determined from
three different baseline activity questionnaires and between
physical activity levels determined by these questionnaires
and measures of obesity and glucose tolerance; and (b) to
compare the prevalence of inactivity in individuals from
the DPP volunteer sample with the NHANES III cohort of
individuals in the United States with impaired glucose
tolerance who had completed the same leisure activity
questionnaire a few years earlier.
METHODS
NHANES III. This survey was conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics at 89 U.S. locations between
1988 and 1994 (16). The survey used a stratified, multistage
probability cluster design with an oversampling of African
Americans, Hispanic Americans, and the elderly (16). A
total of over 18,000 individuals who were at least 20 yr of
age completed a household interview. The survey included
a leisure physical activity questionnaire, which was also
given to DPP participants at their baseline evaluation. The
number of men and women who completed the physical
activity portion of the NHANES III and met basic DPP
eligibility criteria (see below) was 155 women and 144 men.
DPP. Details of the DPP study design have been de-
scribed in detail (27). Participants were recruited for the
DPP from 1996 to 1999. The institutional review board at
each center approved the protocol, and all participants gave
written, informed consent before baseline screening. Inclu-
sion criteria included age of at least 25 yr, a body mass
index value of 24 kgImj2 or higher (22 or higher in Asian
Americans), physical ability to walk a quarter mile in
10 min, and a plasma glucose concentration of 95­
125 mgIdLj1 in the fasting state and 140­199 mgIdLj1
2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load. Standardized interviewer-
administered questionnaires were used to obtain data on
personal and medical history. Height and weight mea-
surements were used to calculate body mass index (BMI,
kgImj2) and waist and hip circumference measures were
used to determine the ratio of waist to hip circumference
(WHR). Blood was drawn at baseline for fasting mea-
surements of glucose, HbA1c, and insulin and for 75-g
OGTT measurements of insulin (30 min postload) and
glucose (120 min postload). Immunoreactive insulin and
proinsulin were measured in the plasma. These measures
have been described (6).
Self-reported physical activity levels were assessed at
baseline using three activity questionnaires with different
time frames: the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (10),
the Low-Level Physical Activity Recall (8,20), and the
NHANES III (16). These are described in detail below.
The modifiable activity questionnaire. The Modi-
fiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) was designed for
easy modification to maximize the feasibility and appro-
priateness of physical activity assessment in a variety of
minority populations and age groups (10) and is the pri-
mary questionnaire used in the DPP (5). A unique feature
of the MAQ is that the list of leisure activities is com-
prehensive and appropriate for the DPP population because
it was developed based on pilot work performed at all
study sites. The MAQ has been shown to be both reliable
and valid (through comparisons with activity monitors,
fitness (field) testing, and the doubly labeled water
technique) in adults and adolescents (2,9,25). The MAQ
assesses past-year occupational and leisure activities,
although leisure activity was the main focus of this effort.
Estimates of leisure and occupational activity were calcu-
lated separately as hours per week (hIwkj1) averaged over
the past year. Each activity was also weighted by its
relative intensity, referred to as a MET, thereby deriving
MET-hours per week (METIhIwkj1) as the final unit of
expression. One MET represents the energy expenditure
for an individual at rest (1 MET = 3.5 mLIkgj1Iminj1 of
oxygen consumption), whereas a 10-MET activity requires
10 times the resting energy expenditure.
The MAQ assesses both leisure and occupational
physical activity over the past year. Only physical activities
that demand energy expenditure greater than that required
by activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, grooming, and
feeding) are assessed. For the leisure section of the
questionnaire, individuals were presented with a compre-
hensive list of activities developed for the entire DPP
cohort (determined by pilot testing) and were asked to
report the activities that they had participated in during the
past 12 months. They were then asked to estimate the
frequency and duration for each activity identified. For
occupational activity, individuals were asked to list all jobs
held during the past 12 months. For each job entry, data
were collected for time spent walking or cycling to work
per day, as well as the average job schedule (months per
year, days per week, and hours per day worked). Activity
on the job was determined by the number of hours spent
sitting at work and the most common physical activities
performed when not sitting.
Low-level physical activity recall. The original 7-d
Physical Activity Recall (PAR) was developed primarily
for use in large population studies to evaluate habitual
physical activity levels in healthy persons (3,22,26). The
Low-Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR) was modi-
fied from the 7-d PAR (23,26) and validated for use in its
present form for persons having low levels of habitual
physical activity because it was suggested that the original
instrument might not be sufficiently sensitive to measure
activity in persons who are primarily sedentary (8,20). The
LOPAR was validated in patients with peripheral arterial
disease as shown by correlations with maximal treadmill
walking time (r = 0.46, P G 0.01), change in maximal
treadmill walking time after exercise training (r = 0.46, P G
0.05), and energy expenditure during home-based exercise
measured by Vitalog microcomputer (r = 0.50, P G 0.05).
In type 2 diabetes, the LOPAR has also been correlated
with markers of exercise performance including V
 O2max
(r = 0.45, P G 0.05; unpublished data, 1996).

As with the original PAR, the LOPAR provides a
general measure of physical activity by assessing the total
energy expenditure of the individual at work and during
home and leisure-time activities for the preceding week
(8,20). The LOPAR has been used in several treatment
studies (exercise training and atorvastatin) in individuals
with peripheral arterial disease (14,19,20). It has also been
used in physiologic studies of persons with uncomplicated
and recently diagnosed diabetes at baseline and after
treatment with exercise training (4).
The LOPAR assesses all types of physical activity
(occupational, leisure, and home), although leisure activity
was the main focus of the present study. The amount of
energy expenditure for each activity is quantified in terms
of metabolic equivalents for each activity. Participants are
asked about the number of hours spent performing very
light (1.0­1.5 METs), light (2­3 METs), moderate (3­5
METs), and heavy (Q 6 METs) activities. Data are reported
in MET-hours per week, derived by multiplying the amount
of time spent performing an activity by the MET value of
the activity.
Physical activity questionnaire from the
NHANES III. The physical activity questionnaire from
NHANES III asked whether individuals had engaged in any
of the following activities over the past month: walking,
jogging, bike riding, swimming, aerobics, dancing, calis-
thenics, gardening, weightlifting, or ``other exercise, sports,
or physically active hobbies not mentioned'' (16). The
summary leisure activity estimate was expressed as times
per month because estimates of duration were not collected.
Individuals were classified as inactive if they did not report
engaging in any of these activities over the past month.
Statistical methods. For comparison of NHANES III
cohort with DPP participants, the NHANES III sample was
weighted according to the population weights provided for
the morning, fasting sample. The weighted percent who
reported being physically inactive based on the NHANES
III instrument from the NHANES III cohort and the
percent inactive among DPP participants were computed
across age, BMI, and race groups.
Comparing physical activity estimates deter-
mined by three activity questionnaires among
DPP participants. Spearman rank­order correlation coef-
ficients were determined to assess both the bivariate asso-
ciations between the various physical activity measures
estimated from the three questionnaires and to examine the
association between these physical activity estimates and mea-
sures of obesity and glucose tolerance adjusted for age and
stratified by sex in this cohort. Leisure physical activity levels
determined by the MAQ were compared between men and
women, ethnic or racial groups, and age groups (G 45 yr, 45­
59 yr, and Q 60 yr) using the non-parametric Mann­Whitney

8.01; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Details of the baseline characteristics of the 3234 DPP
participants have been reported (6). The overall mean age
at baseline was 50.6 (T 10.7) yr. Nearly 68% of the
participants were women, and more than 45% of the DPP
participants belonged to a racial or ethnic U.S. minority
group. The mean BMI for the entire cohort ranged across
ethnic or racial groups from 28.3 to 32.5 kgImj2 for men
and from 30.7 to 36.3 kgImj2 for women.
Baseline leisure physical activity levels of the DPP
participants from the MAQ are presented in Figure 1,
stratified by sex, age, and race or ethnicity. Women
reported being less active than men (P G 0.0001), and
older individuals (Q 60 yr of age) reported more leisure
physical activity (P G 0.0001) compared with younger age
groups. Finally, leisure-time physical activity levels varied
by race or ethnicity, with the small number (N = 20) of
American Indian men reporting more leisure activity than
any other group (P G 0.0002). Similar patterns for leisure
physical activity were observed based on the LOPAR
questionnaire (i.e., highest in the oldest age group and
somewhat higher in men than women; data not shown).
Correlations among the three physical activity measures
(MAQ, LOPAR, NHANES III) collected at baseline of the
DPP are presented in Table 1 stratified by sex. In general,
leisure activity data collected from the three questionnaires
were significantly correlated with each other, although the
correlations between the MAQ and NHANES III were
stronger in both men (rho = 0.52; P G 0.01) and women
(rho = 0.49; P G 0.01) than between that of the LOPAR and
either of the other two activity measures (men: rho = 0.20
for the MAQ and 0.24 for NHANES, P G 0.01; women:
rho = 0.10 for the MAQ and 0.13 for NHANES).
Partial correlations (adjusted for age and stratified by
sex) of activity levels as assessed by these three physical
activity questionnaires collected at baseline and measures
of obesity and glucose tolerance are presented in Table 2.
For both men and women, physical activity estimates
obtained from the MAQ (leisure and total activity) and the

NHANES III (leisure activity) but not the LOPAR (leisure
and total) were significantly and inversely associated with
BMI, waist, and hip circumference measures. The
NHANES leisure estimate was significantly related to
waist-to-hip ratio in men but not in women. Likewise,
physical activity estimates obtained from the MAQ (leisure
and total activity) and the NHANES III (leisure activity)
were generally significantly and inversely associated with
fasting and 75-g OGTT measurements of insulin (fasting
and 30 min postload), fasting plasma proinsulin, and
HbA1c. The LOPAR leisure activity estimate was signifi-
cantly and inversely correlated with fasting and 30-min
postload insulin in men alone. Physical activity levels from
these three questionnaires were not consistently associated
with fasting or postload glucose values (Table 2).
Finally, presented in Table 3 are the leisure physical
activity levels collected with the NHANES III instrument
for the DPP participants compared with activity levels
reported by individuals meeting DPP eligibility criteria
who were part of the NHANES III cohort. In general,
women were less active than men in both cohorts, with
relatively more women reporting being physically inactive,
consistent with the DPP_s MAQ and the LOPAR results.
The DPP women and men were less inactive than the
NHANES III sample for most age, BMI, and race or
ethnicity groups.
DISCUSSION
Many of the current findings regarding the physical
activity levels of the DPP participants were anticipated and
consistent with previous literature. Among the DPP partic-
ipants, men reported participating in more leisure activity
and, therefore, were less likely to report being inactive when
compared with women. This was a consistent finding across
three national U.S. surveys (National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) 1991, NHANES III 1988­1991, and the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 1992) (17),
where the ratio for the prevalence of physical inactivity for
women compared with men ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 across
these three surveys (17). That men reported more leisure
activity and less inactivity than women was also seen in the
subgroup of the NHANES III cohort with known type 2
diabetes (15). Physical inactivity measurement in the
NHANES III was based on reported participation in
leisure-time physical activity alone and did not include
participation in nonleisure activity such as housework or
occupational activity.
Based on the average number of hours of reported
leisure activity per week averaged over the past year, the
most active age group in the DPP cohort was aged Q 60 yr.
This trend held, for the most part, across all sex and ethnic
groups. This finding is inconsistent with the general notion
that physical activity decreases with age in adults (17,24).
Closer examination of national data collected around the
time of the DPP (17), however, showed that the percent of
adults, particularly men, who reported regular, sustained
leisure physical activity (five or more times per week for
30 or more minutes per occasion) was somewhat higher in
the aged 65- to 74-yr group compared with the aged 30- to
44- or 45- to 64-yr groups. For example, the percent of men
and women reporting participation in regular, sustained
physical activity in the 1992 NHIS was 24.1, 24.2, and
29.2% in men and 20.4, 20.6, and 21.3% in women for the
three age groups (30­44, 45­64, and 65­74 yr). Likewise,
the percent of men and women reporting participation in
regular, sustained leisure physical activity in the 1992
BRFSS was 17.4, 18.9, and 26.8% in men and 18.5, 19.4,
and 19.0% in women for the same three age groups. An
increase in leisure activity levels with retirement had also
been seen in individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities Study (7). These data suggest that a
substantial number of older adults of retirement age spend
a significant amount of their time engaging in measurable
levels of leisure physical activity. An additional explana-
tion may be that the older DPP participants may have been
more physically active or lifestyle conscious throughout
life, and thus may have attained a later age before
becoming IGT and thus eligible for the DPP.
Three different activity questionnaires that varied by
time frame were used to assess baseline physical activity
levels in the DPP. The advantage of assessing activity
using a survey with a short time frame, such as prior week,
is that the estimate is less likely to suffer from recall bias.
In contrast, assessment over a longer time period such as
1 yr is more likely to reflect ``usual'' behavior because
activity levels can vary with season, poor health condition,
or unexpected time pressures (10,12).
Comparing the leisure physical activity results from the
three measures collected at baseline, it is not surprising that
the MAQ (10) and the LOPAR (8,20,23,26) were not
strongly related, at least in part because the latter assesses
past-week activity, whereas the MAQ asks about physical
activity over the past year. Previous studies in both
adolescents (1) and adults (28) found stronger relationships
between past-year physical activity assessment and the
average of four past-weeks recalls collected over the same
year than when just one past-week recall was used. It is
possible that LOPAR repeated throughout the year would
be more strongly related to the past-year MAQ than one
time point alone.
Another consistent finding in the present study was that
the leisure sections of the MAQ and the NHANES III
questionnaires were more strongly related to each other than
either one was to LOPAR. Part of the explanation for this
finding is the specific components of physical activity that
these three questionnaires assess. Both the MAQ and the
NHANES III questionnaire assess the frequency of popular
moderate- to high-intensity leisure activities, whereas
LOPAR attempts to quantify the entire spectrum of
intensities, including activities of daily living, by asking
about the number of hours spent in sleep and in very light,
light, moderate, and heavy leisure activities during the
previous week. This difference in the components of
physical activity assessed by these questionnaires resembles

the comparison of food frequencies to that of food recalls in
the dietary assessment literature and may explain, at least in
part, the small correlations observed between the measures.
Biological variables of obesity (waist, hip, BMI, and
WHR) and glucose tolerance (insulin, proinsulin, glucose,
and HbA1) were examined in relation to the physical
activity estimates obtained by these three questionnaires as
criterion measures to validate the questionnaires. In general,
the NHANES III and the MAQ were significantly related to
each other and to most of these biological variables, with the
exception of glucose and WHR. In contrast, the LOPAR was
found to be less consistently related to any of these
biological measures, suggesting that its use may be more
appropriate in lower-functioning individuals for whom it
was initially designed (8,20) or in a less diverse population.
The most interesting finding was that the level of reported
physical inactivity in the DPP cohort was less than that
reported in the NHANES III subgroup with impaired
glucose tolerance. This finding was evident across most
age, BMI, and racial or ethnicity groups. Although the small
sample size of the NHANES III subgroup may suggest a
chance reason for this finding, another explanation might be
the different sample selection in the two studies. The
NHANES III survey is a cross-sectional observational study
of a random sample of the U.S. population. In contrast, the
DPP cohort represents a volunteer sample of individuals
committed to a long-term intervention study. In addition,
one of the inclusion criteria for the DPP was that you had to
be physically able to walk a quarter mile in 10 min, whereas
such criteria for NHANES III did not exist. Considering the
range of options described above for the finding that
reported physical inactivity in the DPP was less than that
reported in the NHANES III, the most likely explanation is
that the DPP participants were a healthier and possibly more
motivated group of individuals because they agreed to
participate in this clinical trial and they met the DPP
eligibility criteria. If this is true, these findings have
implications for the translation of the DPP findings. On
one hand, if the DPP cohort was healthier and somewhat
more motivated than individuals in the general U.S.
population with impaired glucose tolerance, then it could
be more difficult to implement the DPP healthy lifestyle
program in the latter. On the other hand, the impact of the
DPP lifestyle intervention might be greater in those who are
less active at baseline.
One of the main focuses in recent public health research
is the effort to translate the lifestyle intervention portion of
successful efficacy trials such as the DPP program into the
community (18). Thus, the suggestion that those individ-
uals in the general community in the United States with
prediabetes would be less motivated than the DPP
volunteer cohort is an important finding. Coupled with a
smaller budget, less personnel, and less training and
support, the likely addition of less motivated community
participants adds to the challenge of these future translation
efforts. In lieu of these difficulties, we need to adjust our
expectations accordingly with regard to the potential
impact of these community efforts.
In summary, baseline leisure activity in the DPP cohort
suggests that men and women in the DPP trial may have
been more active than the small subgroup of individuals
from the NHANES III cohort who had impaired glucose
tolerance. This may possibly be a ``healthy volunteer
effect''; if so, this would have implications for the future
translation of the DPP lifestyle intervention in other
populations. Finally, the weak relationship between leisure
physical activity levels obtained with the MAQ and the
LOPAR is consistent with the fact that they encompass
both different time frames and different components of
leisure physical activity.
