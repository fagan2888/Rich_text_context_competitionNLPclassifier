Gro w th of managed care and the  decline  of  direct access are two of the major issues confronting der­ matology. Previous study has demonstrated  that  pa­ tients in man age d care are  less  likely  than  patients with indemnity insuranc e to  se e  a  dermatologist  for skin problems, and it was predi c te d that this  would result in a slowing in the  demand  for  dermatologist servic es. To ex am in e whether the  changing  health­ care en viron 1n e n t has resulted in fewer visits to der­ matolo gists , we used N ati on al Ambulatory Medical Care Su rvey data from the ye ars 1990-1992  to exam ­ ine utilization  of  dermatologist  services over  a  period in which man ag ed care grew by 32%. Patients with HMO/prepaid in suran ce were less likely to have their skin care  provided  by  dermatologists  than  patien ts with commercial insurance (Blue Cross/Bl ue Shield


T

and other commercial carriers) or Medicare. A reduc­ tion in the number of visits to dermatologists was observed among patients with HMO/prep aid insur­ ance despite the growth in HMO/prepaid  insurance  as a form of payment; when all payors were considered, however, the number of visits to dermatologists in­ creased from the 1989 level, reaching  a  plateau  in 1992. The number of visits for skin disease to all physicians increased from 56.5 million to 63. 5  mil­ lion, whereas the proportion of this care delivered by dermatologists decreased from 39 .6% to 37 . 9%. The overall increase in visits for skin conditions tempered the reduction in demand for dermatology services expected with the growing transition to managed care.

Al t h o u g h sim ilar studies have not been performed for ski n co nd i­ tions, Stern and Nelson (l 993) anal yze d 1.989 a nd ea rl ie r data from the   National   Ambu lato ry  Care  Survey  (NAMCS)   a nd  found a
di.Ininished role of the dermatolo g ist  in  ca rin g  fo r  skin  disease. Their data sho we d m uc h g re a te r use of non-dermatologists for care of skin disease by patients in HMO o r preferred provider organi­ zations. They predicted that growing use of these forms of payment would result in a " s u b sta n tia l n ega ti ve impact on the demand for dei:n1atologists' services ." To test the hypothesis that growing
managed ca re would result in diminished use of dermatology services over ti.me, we analyzed 1990, 1991, and 1992  NAMCS data.
MATER.JA.LS   AND  METHODS
  NAMCS is conducted by the National Center for Hea lth Statistics as an ongoing descriptive data collect io n effo rt regarding office-based physician practice  (Nation'11 Cente  r for Health Statistics, l  992,   1993,   1994).   The sam p li n g was Limited to   nonfcderally   em ploye d   physic ia ns   princi pally en g a g e d in outpa tie n t care activities. The mult istage probabi.liry samp lin g desigi.1 '\-Vas stratified by priniary sa1n p ling  unit  (co un ty,  co ntiguo  us co untie  s, or sta n d ard  metropolitan  statistical  area),  then by physician  pract ice s wit h.in the	sai  n plin g unit, and, finally, by  patient visit  within   the   52   week ly rand  o m ize d  pc,-iods. Within sma ll practice  s," 100 % sa m ple of  visits during a 1-wk period was possible . For very large pract ice s,  20%  of  patient  visits were r  and om ly  sa m ple d.  The  resu l tin g  nat iona l  est im ates  desc ribe  th e uti liz a ti on of ambulatory service s in the United States.
  The st ud y interval of] 990- 1992 was chosen because these were the mo st recent data ava ilab le. For all patients and dia g noses, the entire 1990, 199 1 , and 1992 data bases ha ve respectively 43.469, 33,795, and 34,606 records, whi c h are used to estimate the ex pe rie nce of 704, 670, and 762 million ann u al office-based visits of all type s in the United States. For each visit sam p le d , a one -pa ge patient log was com plete d that in clud ed demograp hic data, reasons for patient visits. physicians' diagnoses. serv ices provided, and referral pract ice s. For th is study, visits coded with H MO / prepaid insurance we re c o nside red " 1na 11agcd care.'' To detern1ine ,Nhcther the study in terva l was su ffic ie nt ly long to dete ct cha nges in pract ice patterns due to managed care, we determined the total num ber of visit s for all problems covered by HMO/prepaid insurance. Over the  study  interval  of 1990-1992.  HMO / pre p a id insuran ce increa se d from 14.5'¼, of all visits (1.01 X 10 8 visits) in 1990 to 19.2% (1.46 X '10 8 visits) in 1992 . Thus, there was a 32% in crease in the p erce ntag e of visit s covered by H MO / prepa id in surance (and a 45% inc r e a s e in the actua l num be r of visits cove red by H MO / prepa id insur an ce). T his s u bsta ntial increase in the number of visit s cove red by HMO/prepaid insur   a n ce  provides  a methodologic  basis for studying   t he  effect of  managed care o .n practice patten1s.
  To define dermato logi c diagno ses, the en tir e d e rmat o log ist sub samp le was  extracted  fron1 the   l 990  nation.a] data  base,  a nd  prin1ary, scco n,d u  y,   or te rti a ry diagnoses rep rese n ting greater than 0.1% of visits to these clin ic ian s were i d enti fied. After review of the resultant Intern ational C la ssi fication of Diseases codes, "V" codes (suppl e me ntal c.lassification of factors influ e ncin g health stat us and co nta c t with hea lt h service s) were eliminated as were othe r non d er m ato log ic d iagnose s (Med Ind ex Pub. 1992; Kro wchuk ct n/, 1994). Usin g the remaining codes, data for all providers were st ud ied co isolate

those visits for w hich the primary  diagno sis was  a derm ato logic  co ndi tion; suc h visits were co nsid e red visits for skin cnre, the prin1ary variable assessed  in this study. A n ide nti ca l process was performed with the  1991.  and  1 992 data sets.
  Samplin g we ig h ts we re app lied to achieve the nationa lly representative estimates. Var ia ble s chosen for a nalysis were thou g ht n priori to represe n t the most lik e ly variab le s on w h ic h mana ge d ca re may have an im pact. T hese variab le s included all variab les dealing with payment for pbysician services. disposition of patient s, a nd sources  of patients . Additionally, the  specific diagno ses in eac h ye ar were reviewed. T he  NAMCS  met hod  for  record ing am bulatory surgery changed from 1 99 0 to 1991 , allowi ng fo r much greater evaluation of these data.
All estimates derive d from the NAMCS arc subje ct co samp lin g variabi l­

To  test for  t his,  visits for skin co ndition s as a proportion of all visi ts in the H MO / prepaid secto r we re dete rm in ed (Table III). V.ists for skin co nd itio ns as a proportion  of a ll  visits  dropped  24% fro m 10.6' % in 1990 to 8.0% in

T he chan g ing payo r mix for dermato logy visits o ve r this in terva l is prese nted in Table IV.
  The in crease d dema nd for de rmatolo g ist service s was not pri­ marily du e to an in c rease in the proport io n  of  patients  seen  by derm ato log ists. In 1989 , 41'1/., of skin car e visits were to dermatol­ ogists, much lo wer than th e 50%  repor ted  in  1980  (Stern  and Nelson, 1 993 ). Tn 1990, dermato logis ts ca re d for 39.6°/4, of th e visits, 44.6% in 1991, and 37.9% in 1992. T he in creased demand for derm ato log ist services app ea rs to be due to the mark e d gro wt h in the to tal numb er of  visits for  skin disease.  Although  ther e  was o nly a 9% increase in office visits fo r skin pro blems ove r the 15-y period betw ee n  1974  and  1989  (and   a  4%  decrease   betwe en  1980  an d 1 989) (Stern et al , 1 977; Ste rn  and  Gardocky,  l 986;  Stern  and Nelso n, 1993), there was  a  24%  increase  in  office  visits  for  skin pro ble ms in the 4-y period 1989- 199 2 (51 millio n in 1 989 to 63.5
million in 1992).
Increasing  Complexity   of   Care   for   Both   Derm ato  lo gist  s and N on -D erm ato lo g ist s  Potential  effe c ts  of  transferring  the car e of pati en ts from derm ato log ists to n on -d erma to log ists are an incr ease in the co mpl ex ity of skin pro ble ms see n by derm ato lo gis ts and a reduction in the pro portio n of patie n ts who arc refe rred from other physi cian s (H ughe s and W at ers, 1993).

va1i ab le. Data presented here show in g lo nger visit times for patients seen by non-dermatologists 11ers11s dermatologists adds  important eviden ce that fewer reso urce s are used when dermatologists arc

and Baker, 1.995). T he trends that we observed in a variety of areas could have a sig n ificant impact on dermato log y.

respo ns ible for the treatment of skin disease. W hi le shorter visit	 	

times to dermatologists could also be ex plained  by  less comp lex visits, we feel it is a reasona ble ass ump tion that the  complexity of care of patients under  the  care  of  dermatologists is  at  le ast as great as that of patients with skin disease cared for by non-dermatologists. With the growth of managed  care,  we  expect  the complexity  of care provided by dermatologists to in crease, as on l y patients  with more severe skin disease are refe rred. T his also imp lies greater complex i ty of skin care for the non-d e rma tologi sts, as they begin to care for patients they previously wou ld have referred. T he o bserved increased visit duration for both the dermatologists and  the  non­ dermato log ists is co mpa tib le with this hypothes is. T his raises another quest io n for dermatology  to  consid er:  what  can  we do  to im pro ve non-dermatogists	' abilities to handl  e  the greater quantity an d n e w dist1ibution of  skin  condit io ns  for  whi c h they  care Qohn so n, 1994)? Ano ther observation of this st ud y is the decreasing proportion of patients referred to dermatologists from ot her  phy­ sicians. Resentment to this and to the changes in the health-care
. syste rn may complicate the que stion of how to best ed ucate non-dermatolog ists (Little et al , 1993 ).
T he NAM CS pro vide s a com pre hens ive assessment of o u tpa tient
med ic a l services provided in the  United  States and  permits ana lysis of  outpatient  dermatologic  care.  Since   Me ndenhal   l·   et   al  (1978) fo un d that 97'X, of all dermato logi c serv ice s are performed ou tsid e the hospital sett ing, estimates of outpatient care, as found in the NAMCS, shou ld mirror the  vast  majority  of  skin  disease  care. Certain limi tations of this analysis of data supp li e d by tl1e NAM CS deser ve me ntion.  The  patient population  within  managed  care may be sig ni ficantly different from the traditional insurance plan popu­ lation, espec ially  in  regard  to chronic  diseases.  We  have  attempted to address this problem by ana lyzi11g visits for specific skin cond i­ tions;  the  finding  of  lower  dermatologist  utilization  within  man­ aged care is still observed. Another li m itat io n is the variability in the data under cond itio ns with fewe r  visits·,  such  as  in  the  data  for speci fic diagnos es in Table VI. This is a statistica l effect of the sma ll sa mp le re pres entin g data on specific diagno ses. Such data shou ld be interpreted caut io us ly but may be useful for suc h purposes as determining the most common sk in  cond itions  for  future  a n a lyses or ed uca tio nal programs. T he ex clus io n of federally emp lo yed physicians from the NAMCS database may also co ntt·ibu te to under-reporting of  dermato logic  disorders.  A lso,  the  nature  of  the sur vey does not pe rm it verification of dermatologic diagnoses. It is possibl e, there fore, that misclassification of cutaneo us diso rder s occurred; this limit atio n is not l.i ke l y to im pact  significantly  the numb er of visits for all skin cond itio ns, however.  Since  NAM CS data are based on utilization  of  hea lth- care  services,  they  do  not perm i t c alc ulatio n of cutaneous disease inciden ce or  preva lence rates in the U nited States.
  Perhaps the most imp ortant limitation of this ana lysis is the sho rt (3-y) pe1i o d co ve red by the ana lysis. T re nd s observed over th.is pe1·io d may not dete ct the full impact of managed care and  may not refle ct the lo ng - term changes that are occurr in g in this area. T he reliability of hea lth ser vices  pred ictions  based  on  c urrent  trends  is li mi ted but is bett er than predict io ns no t based on data (Bilheimer and Reischauer, 1995) . T he imp act of managed care on dermatol­ ogists appears to have been temp ered by the rapid overa ll growth in visits fo r skin care. This rapid growth may be due  to  successf  u l efforts to increase the visibili ty of  our  specialty  and to  focus attention on disorders of the ski n. As  this gro wth reaches a  plateau, we  can  ex pect  a  much  greate r  elfect  of  managed  care  on   the pract ic e of Derm ato log y.
  Despite these limitations, ana lysis of the 1990 to  1992  NAM CS data demonst ra te the availability of these data for analysis and their potent ia l for monitoring U.S. h ea lth- ca re delivery. A sh ift in the paradigm of health-care delivery is occ urr ing, and physician s are choos in g pra ct ice setti n gs to acco mmodate this change (H ugh es
