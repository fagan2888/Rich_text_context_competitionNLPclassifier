A Comprehensive Strategy for Developing
Closed-Ended Survey Items for Use in
Studies of Older Adults
Neal Krause
School of Public Health and Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan,Ann Arbor.
Objective. The purpose of this study is to describe the development and implementation of a nine-step strategy for
devising closed-ended survey questions that assess religion in late life. The intent was to illustrate one way in which
qualitative and quantitative methods could be combined in the same study.
Methods. The following methods and procedures were developed to create closed-ended questions: Focus groups,
in-depth interviews, input from ongoing quantitative studies, input from an expert panel, cognitive interviews, a quantitative
pretest, a nationwide random probability sample of elderly people, and rigorous empirical psychometric testing. Three hun-
dred ninety-nine older people took part in the first seven steps, and 1,500 elders participated in the nationwide survey.
Results. Approximately 175 closed-ended survey items were developed assessing 14 different major dimensions
of religion. In the process, practical solutions to a number of problems encountered in implementing the nine-step
strategy are discussed.
Discussion. The item development strategy may serve as a template that can be used to improve the quality of
closed-ended survey items that assess a wide range of topics in social gerontology.
growing number of investigators are calling for studies
that combine qualitative and quantitative research meth-
ods (Morgan, 1998). This promising strategy is consistent with
the principle of triangulation, in which the combined strengths
of two or more methods are used to produce more valid re-
sults than would be obtained by using the same methods in
isolation (Denzin, 1970). However, as Morgan (1998) points
out, there are a number of ways to combine qualitative and
quantitative methods in the same study. In fact, he proposes
four broad approaches for configuring the interface between
these methodologies. One is especially important for the
purposes of the present study. In particular, Morgan (1998)
argues that the insights provided by qualitative methods,
such as focus groups, may be useful for crafting high-quality,
closed-ended survey questions.
Unfortunately, researchers often encounter two problems
when they try to use both qualitative and quantitative meth-
ods for this purpose. First, even though many investigators
call for the use of qualitative methods to develop quantita-
tive survey items, relatively few show precisely how this
may be accomplished. Instead, most researchers merely
state they have used some qualitative procedure, such as fo-
cus groups, to draft closed-ended survey items, but they do
not fully describe the steps that were followed (see Fultz &
Herzog, 1993, for a notable exception). Second, a number of
different qualitative methods are available, including focus
groups, in-depth interviews, and participant observation studies.
Each of these procedures has its own unique strengths and
weaknesses. Consistent with the principle of triangulation,
it would, therefore, appear that a well-developed item devel-
opment strategy should include more than one qualitative
method. However, no one in social gerontology has discussed
how this should be done.
The purpose of the present study is to address these gaps
in the literature by providing a comprehensive strategy for
combining multiple qualitative methods to develop closed-
ended survey items. This strategy begins with focus groups
and culminates in the quantitative analysis of closed-ended
survey items that were administered to a nationwide sample
of older people. Throughout, an emphasis is placed on pro-
viding practical, hands-on advice for bridging the two meth-
odological approaches.
Three points should be kept in mind as this item develop-
ment strategy is reviewed. First, qualitative methods are used
in this study to enhance the effectiveness of quantitative sur-
vey questions. This may create the mistaken impression that
qualitative methods occupy a secondary position in the re-
search enterprise, and that their sole purpose is to provide raw
grist for quantitative work. Nothing could be further from the
truth. Instead, it should be emphasized that qualitative meth-
ods are important in their own right. In fact, Morgan (1998)
discusses how quantitative methods can be used to enrich
findings from studies that have a primary qualitative focus.
Second, the research described later was designed to develop
survey items to assess religion in late life. Even so, these
procedures can be readily adapted to virtually any substan-
tive domain. Finally, a number of the methodologies that
follow have already appeared in the literature (e.g., focus groups
and in-depth interviews). However, no one has pulled them
together to form a single comprehensive strategy for devel-
oping better closed-ended survey items.
The discussion that follows is divided into four main
A

sections. First, the benefits of combining qualitative and
quantitative methods to develop closed-ended survey items
are explored in greater detail. Second, as noted previously,
the substantive goal of the present study was to develop a
comprehensive battery of items to measure religion in late
life. To provide a better context for understanding how these
measures were devised, problems and issues in the assess-
ment of religion are discussed briefly. Methodological issues
that cut across all nine steps in the proposed item development
strategy are discussed at this juncture as well. Third, the
nine-step item development strategy is presented in detail.
Fourth, limitations and unresolved issues in the implemen-
tation of the proposed strategy are discussed.
Benefits of Combining Qualitative and
Quantitative Methods
The advantages of using qualitative and quantitative meth-
ods in the same study are best presented by briefly reviewing
how researchers typically select or develop closed-ended
survey items. One frequently used approach is to simply take
scales or items that are available in the literature. Although
this is certainly a reasonable strategy, it is often done with-
out checking to see if the items were developed specifically
for older people. Research on social desirability provides a
good example of what may happen under these circumstances.
Survey researchers often ask questions about sensitive is-
sues, such as the excessive use of alcohol or sexual difficulties.
Some investigators are concerned that instead of answering
these questions honestly, study participants may respond in
a socially appropriate manner (DeMaio, 1984). In an effort to
deal with this problem, scales have been devised to identify
those who are likely to give socially desirable responses.
Perhaps the most widely used measure is the Marlowe-Crowne
Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1964). This
measure has been used in a number of studies with older
adults (see, e.g., Kozma & Stones, 1987), yet a careful review
of the history of this scale reveals that it was developed pri-
marily with undergraduate students. As a result, this mea-
sure contains a number of items that do not seem appropri-
ate for elderly populations (e.g., "If I could get into a movie
without paying and be sure I was not seen, I would probably
do it"; Crowne & Marlowe, 1964, p. 23).
Another common strategy for developing quantitative ques-
tionnaires involves writing survey items from scratch with
input from colleagues working in the field. A more sophisti-
cated variant of this approach involves convening a panel of
experts (Fetzer Institute & the National Institute on Aging,
1999). Here, the group of experts is charged with identify-
ing the key dimensions of a conceptual domain and devising
good survey measures of them. Unfortunately, researchers
who rely on expert panels rarely take steps to verify that all
key dimensions of a conceptual domain have been identi-
fied, or that the dimensions that have been specified by the
experts are valid. Instead, the basis of this strategy rests largely
on consensus. The problem with relying on consensus is cap-
tured succinctly in Faust and Minor's (1986) critique of the
DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, ed. III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980). The
purpose of the DSM-III was to devise a comprehensive
scheme to identify, categorize, and describe the different types
of clinical mental disorder. This was accomplished, in part, by
turning to panels of experts. But as Faust and Minor (1986)
point out, expert consensus is not necessarily valid: there was a
time in history when most experts believed the world was flat.
Despite the criticisms of Faust and Minor (1986), care
must be taken not to disparage the use of expert panels. In
fact, this valuable procedure is incorporated in the item
development strategy discussed later in this article. In-
stead, the key issue is that problems may arise when expert
panels become the sole means of developing closed-ended
survey items.
Proponents of the two item development strategies dis-
cussed previously might argue that problems in their work
may be detected and resolved through careful pretesting. This
may be true, but pilot tests are typically not conducted in a
rigorous way. Instead, a draft of the closed-ended question-
naire is typically administered to between 25 and 75 respon-
dents (Oksenberg, Cannell, & Kalton, 1991). The questionnaire
is administered by interviewers who are instructed to look
out for two types of problems. First, they are told to flag any
difficulties study participants have in answering the questions.
Second, the interviewers are instructed to report any prob-
lems they encounter in administering the interview schedule
(e.g., problems following skip-patterns). Once the pilot inter-
views have been conducted, a debriefing session is held by a
field manager, who systematically works through each question
in an effort to see if any of the survey items are not working
well. Unfortunately, as Oksenberg and her colleagues point
out, this strategy is not entirely satisfactory because it relies
on a respondent's ability to express a problem and the inter-
viewer's ability to detect that one is present (Oksenberg et
al., 1991). Moreover, it is not clear what to do when inter-
viewers disagree in debriefing sessions about the presence
or the nature of a problem. Finally, standard pretesting pro-
cedures may flag items that are in need of revision, but this
strategy often provides little information about how to fix
these problems.
It is precisely for these reasons that qualitative studies
may be especially useful for developing closed-ended sur-
vey items. By allowing people to talk freely without impos-
ing a researcher's prior assumptions on the study, qualitative
methods provide an excellent opportunity for getting direct
access to a substantive domain, such as religion. Listening
while older adults share their experiences and feelings about
religion gives researchers an improved understanding of this
construct from the participants' perspective. As a result, in-
vestigators are in a better position to uncover broad themes
and content areas that more accurately reflect the ways that
elders themselves think about and practice religion in
daily life, thereby making it possible to identify key di-
mensions of a phenomenon that have not appeared previously
in the literature.
Another major advantage of qualitative methods is that
they allow investigators to capture the words and phrases
that older adults use when talking about things like religion.
These words and phrases provide excellent raw grist for writ-
ing closed-ended question stems. As a result, researchers
may enhance the relevance and comprehension of the quan-
titative survey measures they devise, thereby improving the
validity of study findings.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS S265
Issues in the Measurement of Religion in Late Life
A compelling number of studies indicate that older adults
who are religious may enjoy greater health and well-being
than elderly people who are less involved in religion (see
Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001, for a comprehensive
review of this literature). Unfortunately, there are at least
two problems with this research. First, as Ellison and Levin
(1998) point out, many investigators use relatively crude
measures to assess religion. In particular, religious prefer-
ence or the frequency of church attendance are often used
as the sole indicators of religion. Although some investiga-
tors have examined other facets of religion, such as religious
support (Krause, Ellison, & Wulff, 1998) or religious coping
(Pargament, 1997), relatively few efforts have been made to
systematically stake out the entire content domain of this
elusive construct (for a notable exception, see the work of the
Fetzer Institute & the National Institute on Aging, 1999).
The second problem with research on religion and health
in late life arises from the fact that the wide majority of religion
measures have been developed solely with younger people.
This is problematic because a number of researchers argue
that the nature and meaning of religion may change as
people grow older (Koenig, 1994). But even when measures
have been developed specifically for older adults, they may
not be appropriate for all elderly people. More specifically,
there is growing evidence of significant differences in the
way that older White persons and elderly Black persons
view and practice religion (Chatters, 2000).Yet, there do not
appear to be any studies that have systematically developed
measures of religion that are appropriate for older people in
both racial or ethnic groups.
The present study was designed to meet these problems
head-on by developing a comprehensive battery of items to
measure religion in late life that would be appropriate for
use with both Black and White respondents. In the process
of conducting this research, a number of critical decisions
had to be made to make the scope of this task more manage-
able and to ensure that the data adequately capture the views
of the typically older person. This was accomplished by
carefully specifying the exclusion criteria and developing a
sound plan for sampling study participants.
Three exclusion criteria were used in this research. First,
the study was restricted to individuals who were currently
practicing Christians, were Christians in the past but no longer
practice any religion, or people who were not involved with
any faith at any point in their lifetime. However, since 90%
of older adults in the United States currently affiliate with
the Christian faith, the measures should be useful for study-
ing the wide majority of elderly people (Princeton Religion
Research Center, 1994). Second, potential study participants
were screened to see if they were either members of the
clergy or if they resided with someone who was a member
of the clergy. Those who were ministers or people who lived
with a member of the clergy were excluded from the study
for the following reasons. Views on the meaning, nature,
and practice of religion among clergy are likely to differ
from those of the average lay person because of the exten-
sive formal training pastors receive in seminary school. In
addition, individuals who live with a member of the clergy
were excluded because they often play a role in the church
that differs significantly from that of the typical rank-and-
file church member (e.g., the minister's wife). Finally, the third
exclusion criterion had to do with religious involvement. In
particular, potential study subjects were asked the following
question: "How important is religious faith in your life?
Would you say it is very important, somewhat important, a
little important, or not at all important?" Individuals were
excluded from the initial steps of the study if they indicated
that religion was not at all important to them. This was done
because it did not make sense to ask people who are not at
all religious to discuss how they practice religion in their
daily lives. Excluding those who are not religious is not
likely to be a major problem because research indicates that
only about 8% of older adults say that religion is not very
important to them (Gallup, 1999). Even so, it should be em-
phasized that once a preliminary set of closed-ended items
was developed, all study measures were carefully tested with
all older subjects, regardless of how religious they may be.
Once the exclusion criteria were specified, a decision had
to be made about how to select eligible participants for the
qualitative components of the study. There is a fairly large
literature on qualitative sampling methods (see, e.g., Lubor-
sky & Rubinstein, 1995), but this is not the place to discuss
the relative strengths of qualitative and quantitative sam-
pling procedures. Instead, it makes more sense at this point
to review the reasons why quantitative, random-probability
sampling procedures were used in this study. Even though
this study was restricted to older Christians, there is tremen-
dous diversity within the Christian faith. In addition to the
obvious differences between Protestants and Catholics, there
is considerable variation in the way that Protestants practice
their faith. The fact that the General Social Survey codes re-
ligious preference into more than 20 different Protestant
churches or denominations provides ample evidence of this
(see the following website for a detailed overview of the Gen-
eral Social Survey: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/gss/). Initially,
it might appear that selecting potential respondents from
different Protestant churches would be a good sampling
strategy. However, this is not a viable option because find-
ings from the nationwide survey conducted for the present
study reveal that approximately 24% of eligible study par-
ticipants either do not go to church at all, or attend church
only once or twice a year. Subsequent analyses revealed that
some were unable to do so because they were either too ill
to go to church, or because they were caring for someone
who was sick.
Given these constraints, a decision was made to use
random-probability sampling procedures. The study popula-
tion was defined as all individuals who are noninstitutional-
ized, English-speaking, and at least 65 years of age and older.
Geographically, the study population was restricted to all eli-
gible persons who reside in Washtenaw County, MI. The
sampling frame consisted of all eligible individuals who
were contained in the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) Medicare Beneficiary Eligibility List (HCFA is
now called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser-
vices). This list contains the name, address, sex, and race of
virtually every older person in Washtenaw County. It should
be emphasized that people are included in this list even though
they are not currently receiving Social Security benefits.
S266 KRAUSE
However, some older adults are not covered in this database
because they do not have a Social Security number (this
may be caused by factors such as illegal immigration).
The names of potential study participants were selected
from the HCFA list with a simple random sampling proce-
dure. Then, sampled individuals were sent a letter informing
them about the nature of the study, and indicating that a
member of the research team would be calling them shortly.
The purpose of the telephone call was to briefly screen sam-
pled individuals to see if they met the eligibility criteria
discussed previously. In general, phone numbers for study
participants were found by checking the local telephone di-
rectories. However, some telephone numbers were more dif-
ficult to locate. Although precise counts were not kept, it
seemed that telephone numbers were more difficult to obtain
for older Black persons than older White persons. This prob-
lem was handled by turning to the recent addition of the R. L.
Polk City Directory for the catchment area covered by our
study. This book contains the results of a survey conducted
by the Polk Corporation to obtain information (including
phone numbers) for every individual residing in a given
geographical area.
METHODS
The nine-step strategy for developing closed-ended sur-
vey items that was developed for this study is presented in
Table 1. The steps in this table are presented in the order
in which they were executed. In the discussion provided, the
procedures that were followed in implementing each step
are described in detail. In addition, where it is appropriate,
substantive findings are presented to illustrate precisely how
the procedures were implemented.
Focus Groups
All together, 8 focus groups were conducted with a total
of 63 older adults. Thirty-one were older African Americans
and 32 were elderly White adults. The groups were run in
four pairs--one consisting solely of older White adults and
one made up entirely of elderly Blacks adults. New subjects
were recruited for each round of focus groups. Focus group
moderators were matched to the race of the study partici-
pants. All subjects were paid $25 for participating in this
study (subject remuneration was used in all phases of data
collection in this study). David Morgan, an expert on focus
groups (Morgan & Krueger, 1998), came to Ann Arbor to train
the moderators and to help run the first round of focus groups.
The focus groups were conducted in a local hotel. All fo-
cus groups were tape recorded and transcribed. In reviewing
focus group transcripts, it is often useful to know the iden-
tity of the speaker because this information enables re-
searchers to get a better sense of important issues like how
widely opinions are shared in the group. Unfortunately, when
listening to tapes of a focus group that consists of six or
eight people, it is often difficult to know who is speaking. To
attribute responses to specific people, a court stenographer
was hired to transcribe all focus group sessions. Because
court stenographers are trained to produce virtually flawless
transcripts, the risk of encountering transcription errors was
reduced significantly. Initially, it may appear that study sub-
jects would be bothered or inhibited by the presence of a
stenographer in the focus group sessions. There are two rea-
sons why this was not a problem in the present study. First,
field notes taken during the course of the focus groups re-
vealed that study participants paid little attention to the ste-
nographer and rarely even looked at this individual during
the sessions. Second, at the end of the focus groups, study
participants were asked if they were bothered in any way by
the presence of the court recorder. Without exception, they
indicated this was not the case, and some even made jokes
about it.
Two key concepts guided the flow of focus group discus-
sions: The funnel approach (Morgan, 1988) and the satura-
tion point (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Because the focus groups
were conducted sequentially over time, a funnel approach
was used to devise the moderator's guide. For those unfamil-
iar with focus groups, the moderator's guide contains a list
of topics or questions that are used to stimulate focus group
discussions. The first round of focus groups began with very
general questions that were designed to throw as broad a net
as possible, thereby ensuring that the views of the research
team were not imposed on the group discussions (e.g.,
"What is the most important part of living a religious life?").
Initially, the members of the research team read the tran-
scripts from the first round of focus groups on their own. Then,
the team met as a group to reach a consensus about what had
been said. This information was subsequently used to draft a
series of more specific questions for the next round of focus
groups. So, for example, more targeted questions were
asked about church-based social support ("Some people say
that the help and guidance they get from people at church is
important. What do you think? What are some of the ways
people in your church may help each other?").
Two important points must be made about the funnel ap-
proach. First, consistent with the basic tenets of qualitative
interviewing (Madill, Jordan, & Shirley, 2000), this strategy
helps ensure that the substantive content of the focus group
questions, and the way they are phrased, are determined by
the subjects. Second, because data from earlier rounds of fo-
cus groups were used to devise questions for later rounds of
focus groups, the content of the moderator's guide changed
several times during this phase of the study (see May
1991, for a more detailed discussion of this data collec-
tion strategy).
Concerns may arise over the use of the funnel approach
because it may seem as though the use of more focused ques-
tions would prohibit those who participate in later rounds of
focus groups from expressing their own views. This poten-
tial problem was addressed in the following manner. Even in

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS S267
later rounds of focus groups, the moderator always began
with general questions about religion, and only asked more
focused questions after study participants had sufficient
time to respond to the more general questions. In this way,
the general questions provided a way to continually bring
new information on religion to the foreground.
In the process of conducting qualitative research, investi-
gators often reach the point where respondents in later rounds
of focus groups begin to discuss the same issues that emerged
in earlier rounds of focus groups. This is called the satura-
tion point (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). If the goal of a study is
to flush out the content domain of a construct, gathering re-
dundant information is not useful. Therefore, once the satu-
ration point is reached, the moderator's guide is changed so
that time spent with study subjects can be devoted to uncov-
ering new information.
The focus group data were evaluated using a two-level
qualitative data inventory. The first level, which is part of the
funnel approach discussed previously, consisted of a more
general assessment of the findings. Here, the intent was to
sort the data into relatively crude large-level categories that
could be used to identify themes to pursue in later rounds of
focus groups (Brenner, 1985). Consequently, this first-level
assessment of the data was an ongoing process that unfolded
over the course of all eight focus groups. The second level
of analysis began once the focus groups were complete.
Here, members of the research team reviewed the transcripts
and independently developed a more detailed coding scheme
(Mishler, 1986). Following this, team members met as a
group, discussed their coding schemes, and arrived at a con-
sensus on how best to present the data.
The focus groups provided a wealth of information about
religion in late life. Two papers were written to explore se-
lect areas in detail: One examined negative interaction in the
church (Krause, Morgan, Chatters, & Meltzer, 2000a), whereas
the other dealt with prayer (Krause, Morgan, Chatters, &
Meltzer, 2000b). The findings on prayer will be reviewed
briefly to highlight the rich insights that emerged from this
phase of the item development strategy.
Most research on prayer focuses on how often people
pray and the types of prayers they offer (e.g., prayers of thanks-
giving or petitionary prayers requesting specific outcomes;
Poloma & Gallup, 1991). However, it became apparent over
the course of the focus groups that study participants had a
good deal to say about whether prayers are answered, and if
they are, how answers are provided. So, for example, some
felt that prayers are answered right away, whereas others be-
lieve that God answers prayers whenever He is ready. More-
over, some felt they got exactly what they asked for in a
prayer. In contrast, others indicated they did not always get
what they asked for. However, when these individuals took
the time to think about it, they found the answer they got
was precisely what they needed most.
This information provides a host of new ways to think
about the relationship between prayer and health in late life.
For example, older people who expect immediate answers
to prayers may become disillusioned, and lose hope, if the
anticipated answer is not forthcoming. As research indi-
cates, the loss of hope may be an important risk factor for
some health problems (Nunn, 1996). To empirically evalu-
ate this issue, closed-ended questions were crafted in later
phases of this study to assess beliefs about the timing of an-
swers to prayers.
A major advantage of using focus groups arises from the
fact that it is possible to observe and record how older
people talk to each other when they discuss important topics
like religion. The words and phrases they use provide excel-
lent raw grist for writing closed-ended question stems.
There are, however, several disadvantages in using focus
groups. First, respondent burden is heavy because subjects
must leave their homes and come to a common location,
such as a meeting room in a local hotel. Unfortunately, this
makes it difficult for elderly people to attend focus groups if
they do not have adequate transportation, or if they are physi-
cally challenged. Transportation problems may be dealt with
by providing cab rides for those who need them, but little
can be done to improve attendance rates among older adults
with physical health problems.
The second disadvantage in using focus groups is dis-
cussed by Knodel (1995). He argues that the presence of
others in the focus group may make it difficult to disclose
information of a personal nature. Because some older people
may consider their religious beliefs and practices to be a pri-
vate matter, they may feel uncomfortable expressing their
views and feelings in a focus group setting. In view of these
limitations, and consistent with the principle of triangula-
tion, the next step in the item development strategy involved
conducting a series of one-on-one, in-depth interviews.
In-Depth Interviews
The individual in-depth interviews were conducted face-
to-face with study participants in their homes. All interview-
ers were race-matched with respondents. A new set of subjects
was recruited for the in-depth interviews from the HCFA list.
Once again, the names of potential respondents were se-
lected using simple random sampling procedures. A total of
131 in-depth interviews were completed successfully. Approx-
imately 61% of these individuals were older White adults,
and 39% were elderly African American adults. All inter-
views were tape-recorded. The interviews typically lasted
between 60 and 90 min.
The number of in-depth interviews conducted for this
study is unusually large (N  131). In fact, some investiga-
tors suggest that as few as eight are sufficient to cover a new
domain (McCracken, 1988). However, the members of the
research team believed it was important to interview a large
number of older people because the content domain of reli-
gion is so vast. This decision was ultimately supported by
the wealth of data that was obtained during this phase of
the study.
Throughout, the funnel approach and the saturation point
concepts guided the flow of the in-depth interviews. As a re-
sult, the content of the questionnaire changed a number of
times as the in-depth interviews were being conducted. It is
important to emphasize two points about the way in which
the funnel approach was implemented. First, following the
procedures used in the focus groups, all in-depth interviews
began with general, open-ended questions about religion
and concluded with questions about more focused aspects of
religion. Second, in-depth interview questions about more
S268 KRAUSE
specific aspects of religion were written with input from the
focus group data. This means that the use of the funnel tech-
nique was extended in this study by carrying insights across
two different qualitative methodologies.
During the course of developing the in-depth interview
questionnaires, a procedure was implemented that departs
significantly from the traditional qualitative approach. As
noted earlier when discussing the funnel approach, focused
probe questions are typically developed based solely on the
input provided by study subjects. However, in the process of
writing the in-depth interview questionnaire, information
from other sources was taken into consideration. Shortly be-
fore the in-depth interviews began, the John Templeton Foun-
dation issued a request for proposals on forgiveness. This
initiative was developed in response to a burgeoning litera-
ture, which suggests that forgiveness may be an important
factor in promoting health and well-being (McCullough,
Pargament, & Thoresen, 2000). However, the focus group
participants in the present study had very little to say about
forgiveness. Even so, the research team decided that since
the goal of the project was to develop a comprehensive set
of religion measures, it would not be advisable to overlook
this potentially important construct. This decision raises a
broader question about how to obtain complete coverage of
a conceptual domain that has been the subject of empirical
and theoretical investigation for some time. For more than
100 years, scholars have been studying religion in an effort
to distill its essential elements (James, 1902/1997). This vast
literature contains many valuable theoretical insights and
important empirical findings (Koenig et al., 2001). We felt it
did not make sense to completely disregard this work. Instead,
a more profitable approach to designing in-depth interviews
involves finding a way to exploit existing material without
compromising the inherent advantages associated with this
important qualitative methodology.
With this objective in mind, a series of open-ended probe
questions on forgiveness were placed at the end of the in-depth
interviews. This ensures that the questions on forgiveness
did not unduly influence or bias responses to the earlier, more
traditional, qualitative probe questions because respondents
were given ample time to express their own views before they
were presented with questions based on external material.
Viewed more generally, this strategy provides a unique way
to more tightly integrate qualitative methods and quantita-
tive research findings in the interests of developing the best
closed-ended survey items.
As the in-depth interviews progressed, it quickly became
evident that the questions on forgiveness evoked the most
emotionally charged response that was encountered during
the entire study. This was especially true of questions about
self-forgiveness. Although data are not available to explain
why forgiveness did not arise spontaneously in the focus
groups, perhaps the highly personal nature of this topic ini-
tially inhibited discussion.
Because so many in-depth interviews were conducted (N 
131), the author was the only person to listen to all the tapes.
Different members of the research team reviewed segments
of the taped interviews dealing with specific topics, such as
forgiveness. After these individuals independently coded the
themes that emerged from the data, they met with the author
to discuss their findings and arrive at a consensus on the best
way to code the data.
The in-depth interviews provided rich insights into how
older adults practice religion in their daily lives. The quality
of these data may be illustrated by briefly reviewing some of
the results on forgiveness. More detailed findings on for-
giveness appear in a paper that was written with these data
(Krause & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2001). As the in-depth inter-
views progressed, it quickly became evident that respondents
held quite different views about forgiving other people. Al-
though some felt it was their duty as Christians to forgive
others automatically, and not require transgressors to do
anything first, other study participants believed that trans-
gressors must earn their forgiveness. In particular, this latter
group of subjects felt that transgressors must take one or
more of the following steps to be forgiven: (1) transgressors
must be aware of what they have done; (2) explicitly ask for
forgiveness; (3) offer an explanation for the hurtful act; (4)
make a resolution not to repeat the offense again; (5) follow-
up on this resolution by changing their behavior; and (6) make
amends (i.e., provide restitution). These insights set up a se-
ries of intriguing questions about the nature of the relation-
ship between forgiveness and health. First, regardless of how
it is attained, is forgiveness related to health? Second, does
forgiving others without requiring them to do anything first
provide the greatest health benefits, or is requiring trans-
gressors to earn forgiveness more beneficial in this respect?
Finally, if forgiveness must be earned, do potential health-
related benefits increase as transgressors perform progres-
sively more of the steps outlined previously?
In retrospect, it appears as though more valuable data
were obtained from the in-depth interviews than from the
focus groups. Although it is difficult to support this impres-
sion with hard data, study subjects may have provided better
information because they felt more comfortable discussing
sensitive religious issues in the privacy of the individual in-
depth interview (Knodel, 1995). Also, as noted previously,
because the in-depth interviews were conducted in the homes
of study participants, this methodology made it possible to
reach a wider group of older people, including those who
were homebound.
Input from Quantitative Studies
The next step in the item development strategy also de-
parts from traditional qualitative procedures. This phase of
the study emerged serendipitously. As the focus group and
in-depth interviews were being conducted, an opportunity
arose to insert closed-ended quantitative questions on religion
in a nationwide survey of people affiliated with the Presby-
terian Church (USA). Data from the focus groups and in-
depth interviews revealed that many older study participants
valued church-based social support highly. Although rela-
tively little space was available in the questionnaire for the
Presbyterian study, seven closed-ended items were crafted
from the qualitative data to assess three aspects of church-
based support: Emotional support from rank-and-file church
members, emotional support from the pastor, and spiritual sup-
port from church members. Spiritual support involves things
like sharing religious experiences and helping others live ac-
cording to their religious beliefs. Data from the nationwide
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS S269
Presbyterian survey provided an excellent opportunity to
gain a preliminary sense of the quality of the newly devel-
oped items. In particular, a series of analyses were per-
formed ranging from an examination of simple frequency
distributions to the estimation of a sophisticated second-
order confirmatory factor model. The results of these analyses
appear in a paper by Krause, Ellison, Shaw, Marcum, and
Boardman (2001).
The Presbyterian survey was useful for several reasons.
First, the confirmatory factor model revealed that the newly
developed measures had good psychometric properties (i.e.,
good item and scale reliability).
Second, the Presbyterian study provided an opportunity
to conduct a preliminary assessment of the construct valid-
ity of the newly devised, church-based support items. Con-
struct validity is assessed by seeing whether a new set of
items is related to an established outcome measure in a the-
oretically meaningful way. The Presbyterian survey also
contained a set of widely used indicators on religious cop-
ing responses that were developed by Pargament (1997).
These items assess specific ways that people use religion
when they are confronted by stressful events. Based on the
premise that the selection of religious coping responses are
socially determined, Krause and colleagues (2001) examined
whether the three dimensions of the church-based support
discussed previously are related to religious coping. Data
indicate that people are especially likely to use religious
coping responses when they receive spiritual support from
church members. Even though emotional support from the
pastor was also associated with greater use of religious cop-
ing methods, the relationship was not as strong. In contrast,
emotional support from church members had no effect on
religious coping.
Third, findings from the empirical work with the Presby-
terian data also provided valuable information on how to
implement the funnel approach in the in-depth interviews.
As discussed earlier, the funnel technique involves using
data from earlier rounds of in-depth interviews to develop
more focused questions for later rounds of in-depth inter-
views. The decision to devote scarce interview time to probe
specific areas in detail is based on the nature of the themes
that emerge from the initial in-depth interviews. However, if
the goal of a study is to ultimately develop closed-ended
quantitative survey measures, then relatively unique criteria
must be used for identifying themes that should be probed
more deeply. In particular, an investigator must determine
whether different themes that emerge from the qualitative data
will lead to the development of different quantitative scales,
or whether the themes assess content areas that are so
closely related that they can be more economically assessed
with a single scale. It is sometimes difficult to make this de-
cision based on the qualitative data alone. This was true
with respect to the church-based social support measures
identified previously. In particular, it was hard to imagine
how rank-and-file church members could provide spiritual
support to respondents without also giving them emotional
support at the same time. However, the empirical analysis of
the Presbyterian data suggests that even though the two di-
mensions of church-based support are correlated, spiritual
support is related to religious coping, whereas emotional
support from church members is not. This differential im-
pact suggests that the two dimensions of church-based sup-
port are conceptually distinct and that it would be useful to
continue to invest in-depth interview time in exploring them
both. Viewed from this perspective, the analysis of the Pres-
byterian data provides a relatively unique way of showing
how both qualitative and quantitative methods can be used
simultaneously to develop closed-ended survey items.
Developing Preliminary Quantitative Measures
Once the in-depth interviews were complete, a set of
closed-ended survey questions was developed. These ques-
tions came from three sources. First, some questions were
taken from existing scales (e.g., measures of religious com-
mitment, as well as some religious coping items). Second,
measures devised by other investigators were modified on
the basis of information gleaned from the focus groups and
in-depth interviews (e.g., some indicators of emotional sup-
port from church members). Finally, because good measures
could rarely be found in the literature, the bulk of the items
were developed from scratch.
It is important to provide more detail on how new survey
items were written when good indicators could not be found
elsewhere. Two issues figured prominently in this process.
The first involved creating a list of all facets of religion that
emerged from the focus groups and in-depth interviews. The
two-level qualitative inventory discussed earlier was invalu-
able in this respect.
The second key issue involved confronting the problem of
depth versus breadth. Data obtained in the focus groups and
in-depth interviews were incredibly rich, and the number of
questions that could be written from this material seemed
almost limitless. However, because the final step in the item
development strategy consisted of a nationwide survey last-
ing 70 minutes, crucial decisions had to be made about how
many dimensions of religion to cover, and how many items
to devise for each dimension. There does not appear to be
much guidance in the literature on how to make these deci-
sions. The following approach was used in this study.
First, the members of the research team estimated the
total number of questions that could be administered in a
70-min interview. Second, in estimating the likely number of
items, team members had to take into account the fact that
questions would also be asked about health, psychological
well-being, and a number of factual matters, such as age,
education, and marital status. Once the amount of question-
naire space that could be used to measure all areas of reli-
gion was established, the number of specific dimensions
that could be covered was estimated by turning to the work
of Andrews (1984). His sophisticated latent variable model-
ing analyses reveal that the ideal length of a scale should be
between two and four items. The upper limit of four items
was used in the present study. Although departures from the
target of four indicators ultimately arose, this general guide-
line was, nevertheless, useful. Finally, once an estimate was
derived of the number of dimensions of religion that could
be covered, difficult decisions had to be made about what to
include. This was clearly the most challenging part of this
study phase. Because the ultimate goal of this study was to ex-
amine the relationship between religion and health, decisions
S270 KRAUSE
were based, in part, on whether a particular dimension of re-
ligion is likely to affect the health of older people. Dimen-
sions of religion that might be related to health were identi-
fied by turning to the literature, as well as insights gleaned
from the focus groups and in-depth interviews.
Panel of Experts
Seven scholars with outstanding reputations in the area of
religion graciously agreed to review the items that were de-
veloped for this study. The following researchers were
members of this group: Linda Chatters, Christopher G. Ellison,
Ellen Idler, Harold G. Koenig, Jeffrey S. Levin, Kenneth I.
Pargament, and Robert Taylor. It should be emphasized at
the outset that even though these individuals provided in-
valuable input, the author is solely responsible for any prob-
lems with the closed-ended survey items that were devel-
oped in this study. Although expert panels have been used to
develop items in other studies, a protocol for fully exploit-
ing the expertise of these individuals is difficult to find in
the literature. The following procedures were developed
especially for this study.
First, a complete draft of all the religion items was sent to
each of the experts. They were instructed to rate each indi-
cator on a scale that ranged from 1 to 5, where 5 meant the
question stem and the item response categories were of high
quality, and a score of 1 denoted items that were most in
need of revision. These data were mailed back to the study
field office where frequency distributions of the ratings for
each question were tabulated.
Following this, the experts were all flown to Ann Arbor
for an intensive 2-day review of the study measures. The rat-
ings provided before the meeting were used to structure the
discussions. In particular, the meeting began by focusing on
items with the least favorable ratings. The problems with
each measure were identified, discussed, and potential solu-
tions were proposed. The 2-day session with the experts was
tape-recorded and transcribed.
An example may help illustrate how the expertise of the
panel members was put to good use. Recent research suggests
that, as people grow older, they turn control over specific
domains in their lives to trusted others (Schulz & Heck-
hausen, 1996). For example, some older people turn over the
management of their financial affairs to a grown offspring.
During the course of the focus groups and in-depth inter-
views, the subjects in our study indicated they turn control
over to God as well. A series of preliminary items were de-
vised to capture this domain. Initially, these items focused
on turning things over completely to God, but the group of
experts recommended that a second approach should also be
considered. In particular, they argued that people may only
partially rely on God while continuing to exercise control
themselves. Items were, therefore, developed to capture this
form of collaborative control with God. Following this two-
part strategy makes it possible to see if complete control by
God, or collaborative control with God, is most likely to
enhance the health and well-being of older people.
In addition to reviewing question stems and response for-
mats, the expertise of the group was also used to help deter-
mine the order of the closed-ended questions in the interview
schedule. Toward the end of the 2-day meeting, the experts
were each given a stack of index cards. The name of one di-
mension of religion was written on each card. The experts
were asked to sort the cards according to where the ques-
tions should appear in the final closed-ended questionnaire.
A consensus was determined by tabulating the rankings pro-
vided by the group.
Based on the input from the group of experts, a number of
changes were made to the newly devised religion questions.
The tapes and transcripts of the meeting with the experts
proved to be quite valuable in this respect. In the process,
problems and revisions suggested by these experts were
checked against the focus group and in-depth interview data.
Cognitive Interviews
Once a good set of preliminary closed-ended questions
was in place, a series of cognitive interviews were conducted.
Cognitive interviews involve presenting study subjects with
a closed-ended question followed by a series of open-ended
probes. The purpose of the open-ended probe questions is to
see if study subjects understand the closed-ended question
in the intended manner, to see if respondents can provide a
better way of phrasing question stems, and to see if subjects
feel comfortable with the closed-ended response options.
Eighty-five cognitive interviews were conducted with a
new sample of subjects. Once again, these study participants
were selected from the HCFA list, using simple random
sampling procedures. Up to this point, older adults were ex-
cluded from the study if they indicated that religion was not
at all important to them. However, this exclusion criteria was
relaxed at this point, and all elderly people were included in
the remaining steps of this study regardless of how impor-
tant religion may be to them. Forty-five of the participants in
the cognitive interviews were older White adults, and 40
were elderly African American adults. All cognitive inter-
views were conducted face-to-face in the homes of the
study participants.
The closed-ended religion items were broken down into
four blocks. Cognitive interviews were conducted using ap-
proximately 20 subjects for each of the four blocks of ques-
tions. It was not necessary to probe some closed-ended
questions because a good deal is already known about them
(e.g., "At the present time, what is your religious prefer-
ence?"). The cognitive interviews lasted between 60 and 90
min. All cognitive interviews were tape-recorded.
Initially, members of the research team were concerned
that study participants would quickly tire when they found
that each closed-ended question would be followed by a se-
ries of open-ended probes. This did not prove to be the case.
Instead, the older people in this study worked hard to help
the research team improve the closed-ended questions. This
high level of motivation was due in part to the way the cog-
nitive interviews were introduced. Subjects were told that a
great deal of time had been spent speaking with older people
about religion in an unstructured manner. They were also
told that a series of questions had been written about religion
based on these conversations, but to know if these items are
any good, their critical input was essential. Subjects were
asked to work hard to help the research team uncover prob-
lems and find new ways to improve the questions. This ap-
proach represents a modified version of Cannell's strategy for
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS S271
increasing respondent motivation and commitment (Cannell,
Miller, & Oksenberg, 1981).
Two broad approaches may be followed in developing
probe questions for cognitive interviews. The first is to ask
very general follow-up questions, as in the think-aloud strat-
egy (see Foddy, 1998, for a recent discussion of this tech-
nique). An example will help clarify the nature of these gen-
eral probe questions. Using religion to derive a sense of
meaning in life emerged as an important theme in this study.
Consequently, a series of closed-ended questions were de-
vised to assess this domain. One item from this battery
asked subjects if they felt that, "God has a specific plan for
my life." This indicator was followed with a broad probe:
"Can you tell me a little more about what you were thinking
about when you answered this question?"
These general probe questions did not appear to be espe-
cially useful. Instead, a second approach involving more fo-
cused probe questions was more helpful. This strategy can
be illustrated by turning to forgiveness. Some subjects in the
qualitative studies indicated that when they were hurt by
someone, they were usually able to "forgive and forget." A
closed-ended question was written to assess this topic. After
administering the closed-ended question, subjects were asked
the following focused probe questions: "What does the phrase
`forgive and forget' mean to you? If you were to ask a friend
about this, how would you do it--what words would you
use to see if they can forgive and forget?" The observation
that focused probe questions tend to produce better feed-
back than general probe questions is consistent with recent
research on cognitive interviewing by Foddy (1998).
An example may help clarify how the focused cognitive
interview probes were used to revise the religion measures.
In his outstanding work on the measurement of religious
coping, Pargament (1997) devised an item that asks respon-
dents how often they look to God for strength and guidance
in a crisis. The respondents in our focus groups and in-depth
interviews indicated they turned to God for this purpose, but
the members of the research team were concerned that the
item devised by Pargament (1997) was double-barreled be-
cause "strength" and "guidance" may not mean the same thing
to study participants. To evaluate this possibility, partici-
pants in the cognitive interviews were presented with the
original item developed by Pargament (1997). Focused probe
questions were subsequently asked to see if they felt that
turning to God for strength was the same as turning to God
for guidance. The wide majority of study subjects indicated
they were different and recommended that separate ques-
tions be asked about these issues. Based on their input, two
separate items were developed: "I look to God for strength
in a crisis," and "I look to God for guidance when difficult
times arise."
The cognitive interviews were also used to evaluate the
closed-ended responses for the religion items. For example,
subjects were asked whether they felt it is easier to answer a
question using a standard five-point Likert scale, or whether
selecting a response from a Cantril ladder (scored 1Â­10)
made more sense to them. An effort was also made to learn
more about how older people calibrate closed-ended re-
sponses. For example, subjects were asked whether they
used a particular religious coping response a great deal,
some, only a little, or not at all. Cognitive interview probe
questions were subsequently asked to determine how much
difference (if any) there was between a response of "some"
and a response of "only a little."
The newly developed religion items were revised again
after members of the research team listened to the tapes of
the cognitive interviews. These revisions were made by con-
sulting the data gathered from the focus groups and in-depth
interviews, and by turning to the feedback provided by re-
spondents during the cognitive interviews.
Pilot Study
The closed-ended religion items were administered to a
new sample of 98 older subjects. Half the respondents were
older White adults (n  49), and half were elderly African
Americans (n  49). These subjects were, once again, selected
from the HCFA list. All pilot test interviews were conducted
face-to-face in the homes of the study participants. Only
closed-ended quantitative questions were administered in
this phase of the study. As a result, this step in the item de-
velopment strategy more closely approximates a traditional
pilot test.
The goal of the pilot study was to check the length of the
survey, to examine frequency distributions to make sure the in-
dicators had sufficient variance, and to perform exploratory
factor analyses to examine the structure and psychometric
properties of the newly developed scales. This information
was supplemented with feedback from the interviewers about
any problems they encountered with the questionnaire. Some
minor revisions were made in some of the questions at this
point. In addition, the exploratory factor analyses helped
identify a few items that could be eliminated from some
scales, thereby holding down the overall length of the inter-
view schedule.
After this phase of the item development strategy was
complete, a total of 175 closed-ended questions were in hand
that assessed 14 major dimensions of religion. Copies of the
religion items are available on request from the author.
Nationwide Survey
The next step in the item development strategy involved
administering the closed-ended questionnaire to a nation-
wide sample of 1,500 older people. Data were collected by
Harris Interactive (formerly Louis Harris and Associates).
Interviewing was completed in August 2001. The sample
consisted of 750 elderly White subjects and 750 older Afri-
can Americans. The sampling frame for the study was again
provided by HCFA. Greater detail on the sampling proce-
dures is available from the author.
Before the nationwide survey went into the field, the ques-
tionnaire was reviewed closely by staff members at Harris
Interactive who have considerable experience in writing
closed-ended survey questions. A few very minor revisions
were made to the religion items. Then the entire interview
schedule was evaluated in two brief pilot tests, consisting of
15 subjects each.
Psychometric Testing
The final step in the item development strategy is cur-
rently in progress. A series of substantive papers are being
S272 KRAUSE
written to explore the relationships between select dimen-
sions of religion, health, and well-being (copies of these pa-
pers are available from the author). Detailed psychometric
testing is being performed on the religion measures that are
used in each paper. Four issues involving these tests are dis-
cussed briefly below.
First, all multiple item scales are examined with both ex-
ploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The goal is to
see whether items that were designed to capture a specific
dimension of religion cluster together, and whether the indi-
cators measure each factor well (i.e., whether the factor
loadings are equal to or greater than .400).
Second, the findings from the confirmatory factor analy-
ses are being used to compute internal consistency reliabil-
ity estimates for each scale. More specifically, based on a
formula provided by Rock, Werts, Linn, and JÃ¶reskog
(1977), the factor loadings and measurement error terms as-
sociated with each item are used to derive reliability esti-
mates. So far, the reliability estimates for the newly devised
scales are generally in excess of .800.
Third, in the process of performing the confirmatory fac-
tor analyses, tests are being performed for measurement in-
variance (Bollen, 1989). As noted earlier, older White subjects
make up half the sample obtained in the nationwide survey,
whereas the other half consists of older Black subjects. Con-
sequently, it is important to see whether the factor loadings
and measurement error terms are equivalent in both racial
groups. If these parameter estimates are the same, it is rea-
sonable to conclude that the survey items mean the same
thing to older White respondents and older Black respon-
dents. One goal in conducting the focus groups, in-depth in-
terviews, and cognitive interviews for this study was to de-
velop survey items that mean the same thing to older White
and older Black people. However, the assessment of mea-
surement equivalence in this context is largely based on sub-
jective evaluations of feedback provided by the focus group,
in-depth interview, and cognitive interview participants. The
empirical tests of measurement equivalence that are now
being performed with the nationwide data are a nice com-
plement to these qualitative strategies, and provide yet
another way of more tightly merging qualitative and quan-
titative methods in studies designed to develop closed-
ended survey measures.
Finally, in addition to assessing issues in measurement in-
variance and scale reliability, it is also important to evaluate
the validity of the newly devised measures. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to estimate some types of validity (i.e., predictive
validity) with data that have been gathered at one point in time
only (see Carmines & Zeller, 1979, for an insightful discus-
sion of scale validity). However, it is possible to evaluate
construct validity with the data on hand. As noted earlier, con-
struct validity is evaluated by embedding new measures in
substantive conceptual models to see whether the new indi-
cators are related to select outcomes in theoretically mean-
ingful ways. Although the establishment of construct valid-
ity is an ongoing task that requires replication across a series
of studies, the results that have emerged from the analyses
that have been done so far are very encouraging. For exam-
ple, as one might anticipate, older people who receive spiri-
tual support from their fellow parishioners indicate they
have a closer relationship with God, and people who feel
closer to God report they are more hopeful about the future
(further detail on this is available from the author).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Some time ago, Bohrnstedt (1983, p. 69) wrote that,
"Measurement is a sine qua non of any science." This makes
sense because the relationship between two or more mea-
sures cannot be evaluated properly until good indicators of
each construct are firmly in place. Unfortunately, it seems
that researchers spend far more time discussing how data are
analyzed, whereas far less attention is devoted to how study
measures were devised. This problem arises, in part, because
sound protocols for developing closed-ended survey items
have rarely appeared in the literature. A basic premise in the
present study is that merging qualitative and quantitative
methods represents a promising way to approach this prob-
lem. Some time ago, Lazarsfeld (1944) recommended that
qualitative and quantitative methods be used for this pur-
pose, but there is relatively little concrete guidance on how
to implement this strategy in practice. The purpose of this
study was to provide a practical, yet comprehensive, strategy
for developing closed-ended survey items. Beginning with
focus groups, and culminating in the psychometric testing of
data obtained in a nationwide probability sample of older
people, the intent was to highlight problems and provide
helpful solutions for those wishing to study the content do-
main of a wide range of constructs. Although these proce-
dures have all been examined previously in the literature,
there do not appear to be any studies that pull them together
in one place.
A tremendous amount of work was needed to execute all
nine steps in this study. In fact, it took three full years to
complete this task. Not counting the nationwide survey, the
research team spoke with 399 older adults. In addition to pro-
viding vitally important information on how to develop
closed-ended survey questions, the qualitative interviews
triggered a flood of new ideas about theoretical or substan-
tive issues in the field of religion and aging. As discussed
earlier, a great deal was learned about the steps that may be
followed in the process of forgiveness, as well as beliefs
about how prayers are answered.
Those wishing to use the item development strategy out-
lined above should pay attention to the shortcomings in this
approach. Three limitations are discussed briefly below.
First, because merging qualitative and quantitative methods is
costly and labor-intensive, it is incumbent upon those who
advocate this approach to demonstrate that this strategy pro-
duces results that are superior to findings obtained with
more traditional approaches to survey item development
(e.g., relying on a panel of experts alone). Moreover, we need
to devise ways of seeing whether each step in the item devel-
opment strategy outlined earlier has an equal payoff, or
whether one step (e.g., focus groups) is less effective than
another (e.g., in-depth interviews). Unfortunately, protocols
do not appear to exist for tackling these difficult tasks. De-
veloping a feasible evaluation component should be a top
priority for investigators wishing to merge qualitative and
quantitative research methods in the same study.
Second, with the exception of the nationwide survey, data
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS S273
for all steps in the item development strategy were gathered
in Washtenaw County, MI. This was done because practical,
as well as economic, considerations made it difficult to con-
duct focus groups and in-depth interviews in a wider geo-
graphical area. Nevertheless, research indicates that there
are regional differences in the way Christianity is practiced
(Hunt & Hunt, 2001). Consequently, the items developed in
the present study may not fully capture how older people
in other regions of the nation, such as the rural southeast,
view their faith.
Third, as noted earlier, many interesting dimensions of
religion emerged from the qualitative interviews, but ques-
tions were not written for all of them. So, for example, a good
deal of discussion in the in-depth interviews involved changes
that older adults experienced in the way they practiced reli-
gion over the course of their lives. In fact, a separate paper
was written on this issue (Ingersoll-Dayton, Krause, &
Morgan, in press). Even so, questions on change in religion
over the life course were not included in the final nationwide
survey. As noted earlier, there are no firm guidelines for figur-
ing out which domains should be pursued and which should
be eliminated. In the end, this decision was based on a
subject judgment concerning which domains are most
likely to affect health in late life. However, researchers
who are interested in relating religion to other outcomes,
and investigators who treat religion as a dependent vari-
able, may find that the dimensions of religion that were
excluded from the present study are vitally important for
their purposes.
Both qualitative and quantitative researchers may ques-
tion some of the procedures that were used in the item de-
velopment strategy. For example, qualitative investigators
may not feel comfortable with feeding empirical findings
from ongoing quantitative studies into the in-depth inter-
views (see step 3 in Table 1). Similarly, as discussed previ-
ously, quantitative researchers may feel uneasy about re-
cruiting subjects for focus groups and in-depth interviews
from a local geographical area. Consequently, the greatest
contribution of the present study may arise from the fact that
it provides a concrete forum for opening a more focused di-
alogue on how to best develop closed-ended survey items
for studies of older adults.
