Section for the International Journal of Self-Help & Self-Care
Depression is one of the most common mental health prob-
lems, with a review of European studies estimating the
1-year prevalence of major depression as 5.7% (Wittchen et
al., 2011). However, treatment may be hard to obtain or may
not be sought (Meltzer et al., 2000). One potential additional
source of help for people with depression is online support
groups (OSGs), which have many users worldwide (Griffiths,
Calear, Banfield, & Tam, 2009).
Although some people use depression OSGs even when
they are experiencing severe depression (Houston, Cooper,
& Ford, 2002; Powell, McCarthy, & Eysenbach, 2003),
some aspects of depression, particularly negative thinking
styles and low motivation, may make engagement with
depression OSGs difficult. Professionals wanting to refer
their clients to a depression OSG may not know how best to
proceed. The only empirical evidence comes from Van
Voorhees et al.'s (2013) randomized trial, which found that
an induction procedure emphasizing internal motivation led
to greater engagement than one emphasizing external
motivation.
The present mixed-methods study aimed to explore the
initial process of engagement with a depression OSG by
examining the experiences of British National Health
Service patients encountering such a group for the first
time.
Method
Participants
British National Health Service patients who experienced
depression were recruited. Adults on psychological therapy
waiting lists in three London boroughs were invited to par-
ticipate by their therapist; in addition, patients registered
with general practitioners in these boroughs were able to
self-refer in response to a study website or to information in
community venues. The inclusion criteria were as follows:
(a) self-identified as experiencing depression, (b) Internet
access (either at home or in a public venue), (c) no previous
experience of OSGs for depression, and (d) above 18 and
fluent in English. The study was approved by the Local
Research Ethics Committee.
Thirty-five eligible people (21, 60%, men) expressed
interest. Of these, 15 (43%) went on to take part (6, 40%,
women; 9, 60%, men). Their mean age was 43 (range =

Online Support Groups for Depression:
Benefits and Barriers
Louise Breuer1 and Chris Barker1
Abstract
This mixed-methods study aimed to explore the initial process of engagement with an online support group (OSG) for
depression. Fifteen British National Health Service patients experiencing depression who had not previously used an OSG
for depression were offered facilitated access to an existing peer-to-peer OSG for 10 weeks. Pre- and post-measures of
depression, social support, and self-stigma were taken in addition to a weekly measure of OSG usage. A follow-up qualitative
interview was conducted with a subsample of nine participants. Depression and self-stigma reduced over the 10-week
period, but perceived social support did not change. There was no evidence of adverse outcomes. Perceived benefits of
OSG participation included connection to others, normalization of depression, and stigma reduction. However, engagement
with the OSG was generally low. Barriers included concerns over causing harm to others or being harmed oneself, feeling
different from others in the group, and fears of being judged by others. OSGs may potentially reduce depressive symptoms
and perceived self-stigma. However, considerable barriers may hinder people with depression from engaging with OSGs.
Further work is needed to determine who will benefit most from participating in OSGs for depression and how best to
facilitate engagement.

24-60). Nine (60%) were White British, 4 (27%) Asian, 1
(7%) Black British, and 1 (7%) Greek Cypriot. Ten (67%)
were university graduates. Nine (60%) were self-referrals
and 6 (40%) were recruited via clinical teams. Eight (56%)
were currently taking anti-depressant medication. All partici-
pants were also invited to be interviewed, 9 (2, 22%, women;
7, 78% men) accepted. Their mean age was 43.5 (range =
24-60). Five (56%) of the interview participants were White
British and 4 (44%) were Asian. Eight (89%) were university
graduates. (See Table 1 for individual participant
characteristics.)
OSG
The OSG selected for this study was PsychCentral.com. This
was a U.S.-based peer-to-peer OSG which was "stand-
alone," that is, not linked to another intervention. It was cho-
sen because it was a high-traffic website that had a
constructive atmosphere and was moderated by a team
supervised by a clinical psychologist. Permission was
granted by the website's owner for this research to take place.
Design and Procedure
This was a mixed-methods study, with quantitative measures
taken before, during, and after the intervention, in addition to
post-intervention qualitative interviews.
Participants were emailed an information sheet. If they
consented to take part, they were emailed a link to the online
questionnaire, on completion of which they were directed to
the PsychCentral depression forum and given guidance on
how to register. They were encouraged to write a post to
introduce themselves to the group, and asked to engage with
the site as they wished over the next 10 weeks. At the end of
each week, they were emailed a link to the OSG Usage
Report. At the end of the 10 weeks, they were emailed a link
to the final questionnaire and were invited to participate in a
face-to-face interview. Participants were encouraged to con-
tact the researcher by phone or email if they had difficulties
using the OSG or if they wished to discuss their
experiences.
Participants whose responses to the initial questionnaires
suggested that they were severely depressed or a risk to
themselves or others, i.e., scores >0.3 on the risk scale of the
Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation [CORE] or >1 on
Item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]
("Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting
yourself in some way") were emailed with the suggestion
that they seek additional help, in line with the study risk pro-
tocol. This procedure was followed for five participants.
Measures
Pre­post measures.The following pre­post measures were
used: CORE--Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; Evans et al.,
2000), a 34-item questionnaire assessing general psychologi-
cal distress; PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), a
nine-item depression scale; the Medical Outcomes Study
Social Support Survey (MOSSSS; Sherbourne & Stewart,
1991), a 19-item social support measure; and Depression
Self-Stigma Scale (DSSS; Kanter, Rusch, & Brondino,
2008), two subscales of which were used: "General Self-
Stigma" and "Treatment Stigma."
Measures taken at end only.OSG Questionnaire (OSGQ;
Chang, Yeh, & Krumboltz, 2001) is a nine-item scale mea-
suring overall satisfaction with an OSG. Overall usage: Post-
ings made to the group were identified by searching for
participants' usernames. Each participant's total number of
posts over the 10-week study period was recorded.

week, how long they had used it for, and how many times
they had posted. It also had an open-ended question about
experiences of the group during that week.
Interview
The semi-structured interview schedule covered three main
areas: (a) depression and face-to-face social support, (b)
engaging with the OSG, and (c) view of, and interactions
with, others in the group. Interviews lasted about an hour and
were digitally recorded. Participants were offered £10 plus
expenses.
The data were analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun &
Clarke, 2006). For each transcript, units of meaning were
identified and collated into a tentative set of themes. Themes
were compared across all the transcripts and organized into
general themes and sub-themes, which were checked against
the original transcripts and modified accordingly. During the
process of analysis, the two authors discussed the emerging
thematic structure and attempted to resolve any areas of
uncertainty. The interview data were also triangulated with
week-by-week written feedback from the OSG usage report.
Researchers' Perspective
Qualitative research guidelines (e.g., Barker & Pistrang,
2005) recommend that researchers disclose relevant back-
ground. The first author was a female clinical psychology
graduate student with a positive but limited experience of
using an OSG in a personal capacity. Her initial assumptions
were that OSGs can potentially be helpful, but that there
might be barriers to engagement. The second author was a
male clinical psychologist who had conducted research on
support interventions. The researchers attempted to "bracket"
their assumptions during the course of the study to be aware
of how they might influence their interpretations of the data.
Results
Outcome, Usage, and Satisfaction
Eleven of the 15 participants completed all pre- and post-
measures. Missing data were handled on an intent-to-treat
basis using last-observation-carried-forward.
Depression and self-stigma reduced over the 10 weeks
(Table 2). In terms of reliable change (Jacobson & Truax,
1991), three people improved, 12 showed no change, and no
one deteriorated. There was no change in perceived social
support or the total CORE-OM.
Usage was generally low. The median percentage of
weeks in which participants logged in was 30% (range =
0-80%). The median number of posts over the 10 weeks was
2 (range = 0-13). Eight (55%) participants completed the
OSGQ; their mean score was 27.4 (SD = 10.7, range =
11-39), indicating a moderate level of satisfaction.
Qualitative Interviews
Context. Most participants interviewed described experienc-
ing severe recurrent depression, which had affected their abil-
ity to work and had in several cases led to suicide attempts.
Only one was experiencing a first episode. Several also expe-
rienced other mental health problems such as anxiety, post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and trichotillomania. None
had had any experience of OSGs for depression. One
described a positive experience with an OSG for trichotillo-
mania, and others had used non-mental health online com-
munities. About half had been hopeful about what the OSG
might offer them, for instance, looking forward to sharing
ideas with others and finding people with similar experiences.
The rest were less optimistic, reporting that they had not
expected to benefit from the OSG; they appeared to be moti-
vated by curiosity or a desire to further psychological research.
Thematic analysis. The themes generated from the qualitative
interviews and weekly feedback were grouped into two
domains (see Table 3): perceived benefits and barriers to
engagement.
Benefits
I'm not alone in this.Participants valued the opportunity to
make contact with others with experience of depression. Five
said that they felt less socially isolated as a result of using the
OSG and felt an emotional connection with other users, pro-
moted by others' openness about their experiences of depres-
sion. Three felt that the site had helped to make depression

Benefits
1. I'm not alone in this
1.1. Feeling connected to others (5) There were some people who I could really empathize with. I felt like they were in
exactly the same situation. I think on one occasion I actually posted something
saying that I empathize to that effect . . . (P2)
1.2. The site normalized depression (3) [Using the site] has just reminded me that this is a . . . very common thing, and the
people of the world who experience this . . . that kind of normalizes it a bit. (P8)
2. The value of talking to strangers online
2.1. Site feels safe and non-judgmental (4) The thing about an illness like depression is I think the criticism you get from
outside is quite harsh, painful, and people who have experienced it or have some
understanding of it are, are not like that, it's safe. (P7)
2.2. Anonymity makes it easier to self-disclose (3) It was a bit easier [online] because I knew that I was anonymous. I wouldn't
necessarily have to face those people again. (P8)
2.3. Others here have no preconceptions of me (2) But usually when you're speaking to your friends, they already have an image about
you . . . in the group you're being addressed on what you actually say. (P9)
3. Supporting others and being supported
3.1. I have the group to fall back on (3) There is just this surplus of people in my life to help me that give me this
assurance that I'm going to be okay, and that I'm never going to go into isolation
again . . . If nothing else works out, I have the group to fall back on, and as for
my problems, and I know that I'll have someone to speak to me. (P9)
3.2. I wanted to help others (2) If they have been positively affected [by my post], then I would consider it like you
know, a pat on my back, like okay, so I've done a good job, I've done something
good for the day that has affected somebody's life. And that's why I would want
to do it. (P9)
3.3. Reading about others' experiences helped me (2) It's quite easy to get some support from reading the other people's experiences
. . . Somebody's had something then they say what happened that made it better
which helps because you think "yeah, I can do that." (P7)
4. Could be useful for others or for me at a different time
4.1. 
It could be useful for me if I were more/less
depressed (4)
I remain open-minded about it. It could be that at a different stage of the illness it
would have been differently useful. (P4)
4.2. It seems helpful for other people (4) I'm sure it's a really good site for a lot of people because there's a lot of people
using it and some of them have been on there like 11 years and I'm sure they
get a great deal out of it. (P3)
Barriers
5. Fear of negative impact on others
5.1. I would not be able to help others (3) I don't think [posting] contributed anything. I didn't think it did anything for me, I
didn't think it did, or would do, anything for anyone else. (P4)
5.2. I might make others feel worse (5) So I kind of worry that I'll go on and there'll be some, probably some quite young
person in their teens or whatever, just coming to terms with this, and if I come
along and say "Well, here I am after 20 years and it hasn't got any better" then
that's not going to be very encouraging for them so I'd rather not say anything at
all. (P8)
5.3. I might cause trouble (3) People tend to say the same things. After a while a certain sort of house style starts
to apply. People all say the same stuff and I thought if I do say something it's
going to be radically different from what a lot of other people have said and it
might cause trouble. (P5)
6. Fear of negative impact on self
6.1. There's nothing helpful that anyone can say (3) I just didn't find the things, their replies, were particularly comforting or useful so I
didn't post again for a while. (P2)
6.2. It might make me feel worse (5) "I'd been there, I hated it, I don't want to remember" was one of them; the "no no
no you're going to do yourself damage if you do that" is another one; the "no you
just don't understand" or at least "you don't understand where I've been." (P4)
6.3. Fear of being judged by others in the group (2) I felt like all my sort of social anxiety that I feel about going into a physical room
full of people it was also there, even in this totally anonymous online group. It
still felt as though I was walking into a big party and didn't know anyone, it was
strange. (P8)

seem like a common, universal experience, which they found
reassuring. This was linked to the size and the international
nature of the OSG.
The value of talking to strangers online. Some participants felt
more comfortable talking about depression to strangers
online than to their friends and family. They attributed the
safe, non-judgmental nature of the OSG to the fact that users
had personal experience of depression. Three felt that the
anonymity enabled them to disclose more freely. Two spoke
about the helpfulness of talking with people who did not
have any preconceived ideas about them.
Supporting and being supported.Participants felt supported
from being in contact with the group, even without any actual
communication. Three said that knowing that it was there,
even if they were not using it, was helpful. They appreciated
being able to access the group immediately and at any time,
and some contrasted this with their experience of waiting a
considerable time for therapy. Two talked about wanting to
help others as a result of reading their posts and the sense of
reward that comes from offering help, and two others talked
about the support they had got from reading about others'
experiences. One felt that seeing other people going through
cycles of low moods reminded her that she would once again
come through her own current low patch, and another spoke
about the way in which he had been inspired to try different
ways of coping.
Could be useful for others or for me at a different time. Even if
they had not found the site helpful, participants without
exception expressed the view that the site could potentially
be a useful resource for people with depression, and com-
mented that users appeared to be supporting each other and
seemed to benefit. Four felt that they had been severely
depressed at the time of the research: One spoke about find-
ing it difficult to even motivate himself to log on. Two felt
that the group may have been more useful to them if they
were less depressed, although others said that they would be
more likely to use the site if they were having a bad time.
Barriers
Fear of negative impact on others.Participants' concern for
the other people involved with the group was striking, and
some cited the potential negative consequences that their
involvement could have for others as one of the reasons that
they did not contribute more. In some cases, the concern that
they would not be able to help others held participants back
from seeking support, as they felt strongly that their relation-
ship with the site should be reciprocal. Four participants said
that they sensed that others in the group were vulnerable and
worried that their contributions could make people feel
worse: one said that hearing about her long history with
depression might be discouraging for someone who was
newly diagnosed. Three worried that they might get into con-
flict with others in the group and had held back from posting
because they were afraid that they would express anger or
criticism.
Fear of negative impact on self. Participants were concerned
that spending time on the site might make their depression

7. Not my kind of people
7.1. People were too different from me (5) There was almost a feeling of "If you're well enough to be on here, relating like
this, writing coherently and reading stuff, then you and I are not in the same
place." (P4)
7.2. 
It was hard to tell whether people were
genuine (3)
It wasn't like I was reading things from real people, I was reading things from
people's online versions of themselves which put me off a bit. (P5)
7.3. Discussion was not serious enough (3) I know they mean well the people but it's all that patting on the back and "there,
there, there." It just seemed like it was more of a social gathering than a help
group. (P3)
8. It was hard to talk (to strangers) online
8.1. It was hard to share things about myself (4) What I wanted to offload to someone was all the specific thoughts and worries
I was having, and I didn't feel I could put them down because they were . . .
because I didn't know these people, they wouldn't really know what I was talking
about, or it would be too personal . . . (P8)
8.2. 
Having too much time to think made it difficult
to write (2)
I found it harder online because you've got to think about what to put down. You
can't like . . . When I talk, things come out totally different. (P3)
8.3. The value of people who really know me (4) People on the site didn't really know me or my history at all and they couldn't be
expected to. But that makes a difference because people might just come up
with, you know, a kind person might make a suggestion of something that was
good for them but it might be totally inappropriate for me, but anyone who really
knew me wouldn't have suggested that. (P8)

worse, particularly if they were not feeling especially
depressed. Three felt that others on the site could not help
them, and one who posted messages did not find the replies
helpful. One expressed the view that when people were
depressed they were too withdrawn to interact and when they
were well they were afraid of interacting with other depressed
people for fear of being pulled back down into depression.
Two participants described experiencing social anxiety in
face-to-face situations, and worried about how they would
come across in the group and whether others might be criti-
cal of them.
Not my kind of people.Participants mentioned various
aspects of how others in the group communicated which
discouraged them from becoming involved. The site being
based in the United States made it hard for some partici-
pants to relate to the other users: they mentioned differ-
ences in language, social contexts, and medication names
as barriers to understanding. Three felt that it was hard to
gauge whether others were being genuine, making it diffi-
cult to feel comfortable sharing thoughts and feelings.
Three said that the level of discussion on the site was
too shallow and people's posts could be experienced as
patronizing.
It was hard to talk (to strangers) online. Participants said that
although they wanted to express themselves, it was difficult
to do so in the OSG, because they felt embarrassed and vul-
nerable. Four spoke about the difficulty in establishing rap-
port online (sometimes attributed to factors such as the
asynchronous nature of responses and the absence of body
language and eye contact) which would have made them feel
comfortable enough to reveal personal information. Two said
that both having time to think about what they were about to
say, and not having the pressure of having to produce some-
thing for a listener in front of them, were the inhibiting fac-
tors. Four felt that people who really knew them were in a
much better position to help them through their depression
than strangers online. In interactions with people who knew
them well, these participants valued that they did not have to
explain themselves and their history, that people could tell
how they were feeling, and that they could remind them what
they were like when they were not depressed, which instilled
a sense of hope. Comments from strangers, although sup-
portive, were experienced by some as "meaningless" whereas
real friends' support had more impact.
Discussion
This mixed-methods study introduced a small sample of 15
people with depression, recruited through the British
National Health Service, to a depression OSG and tracked
their engagement with it. Most had moderate to severe levels
of depression at baseline. Over the 10-week period of
the study there were modest reductions in depression and
perceived stigma, with no change in perceived social sup-
port. Overall, there were low levels of engagement with the
OSG.
The reduction in depression is consistent with the results
of many other studies (Griffiths, Calear, & Banfield, 2009).
However, in the absence of a control group, it is not possible
to attribute a causal role to OSG participation, particularly
because engagement was low.
The low levels of activity may reflect the way in which
people naturally engage with OSGs, that is initially spending
a long time viewing the site without posting ("lurking")
before joining the discussion. Lieberman (2007) found that
74% of participants in breast cancer OSGs lurked before they
posted, with half of these doing so for 2 to 8 weeks. To
observe the engagement process as it naturally occurs, a lon-
ger study period would be needed.
Participants not only described several benefits of taking
part in the OSG but also emphasized factors that had hin-
dered their engagement. In contrast to previous studies that
have recruited participants from among existing users of
OSGs (who are likely to be at least reasonably satisfied with
such groups), the present study recruited people who had
never before used a depression OSG, tracking their engage-
ment and allowing the voices of those who find such groups
less helpful to be heard.
Participants showed a striking concern for the well-being
of others in the group and wanted to help them, but several
felt unable to do so, often because their own struggles left
them without resources. Sometimes this inhibited partici-
pants from using the group, as they felt that their relationship
with it should be reciprocal. This raises the question of what
could be done to help users access support without feeling a
pressure to reciprocate immediately.
The main barriers to participation were fears of having a
negative impact on others in the group, or the group's having
a negative impact on oneself. Participants also worried about
their depression being made worse by their interaction with
the group and reported avoiding reading posts with negative
content. This may reflect a more general tendency toward
emotional avoidance among participants which may have
affected their low engagement with the group (Cameron
et al., 2005). In addition, negative beliefs about seeking help
(e.g., that it is a sign of weakness) may also have inhibited
participation.
These concerns are understandable in the light of the
well-documented "cognitive triad" of negative beliefs about
the self, the world, and the future that characterizes depres-
sive thinking (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Levine
and Moreland (2006) suggested that in general people try to
join groups that are maximally rewarding and minimally
costly. Depressive thinking may have led participants to
Breuer and Barker 7
underestimate the rewards and overestimate the costs of join-
ing the OSG. As they did not engage, there was no opportu-
nity for them to gain evidence to disconfirm their negative
preconceptions.
Limitations
This was a small-sample, mixed-methods study. The quanti-
tative arm had low statistical power; the measures were
included to give an indication of participants' overall out-
comes. The sample was a convenience one, but it did have
the advantages of having a range of ages and ethnic back-
grounds, and of giving people access to an OSG for the first
time.
Limiting participants' choice to a single OSG was prob-
lematic, as there is evidence that when people choose a
group that "fits" them best, they are more likely to engage
with it (Lieberman, 2004, 2007). Moreover, the choice of a
predominantly North American group was with hindsight
unfortunate, as cultural differences were often mentioned as
a barrier to participation. Thus, it is unclear whether the low
levels of engagement and barriers to participation found in
this study reflect engagement with OSGs for depression in
general or with this OSG in particular. When the study
started, there was no comparable U.K.-based OSG in terms
of moderation, positive group climate, and high volume of
traffic.
Implications
There was no evidence of negative effects from the OSG,
and some participants reported benefits, which suggested
that clinicians need not be concerned by their clients'involve-
ment with OSGs. It appears that prospective members who
anticipate negative effects simply do not engage with such
groups. Many of the barriers to participation relate to peo-
ple's fears of what might happen were they to take part,
rather than to actual experiences of participation. It is unclear
to what extent these fears are related to cognitive aspects of
depression. Depressed clients may benefit from some thera-
peutic work to help them test the accuracy of their negative
predictions in the initial stages of engaging with such a
group.
Some of the barriers identified in this study are related to
the negative thinking style, withdrawal and lack of motiva-
tion characteristic of depression. It would be valuable to
design an intervention to help participants overcome these
initial barriers and evaluate if this had any impact on engage-
ment. If barriers to active participation can be minimized,
people with depression may then be able to derive more ben-
efit from online support.
