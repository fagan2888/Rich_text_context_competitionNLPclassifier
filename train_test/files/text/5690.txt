Introduction
The SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response
codes) effect reflects the finding that numbers are spatially
coded along a mental line ranging from left to right, from
lowest to highest, respectively (Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux,
1993). A consistent number of studies refer to the scanning
(i.e., oculomotor) strategies linked to reading habits for
explaining the origin of this phenomenon. Scanning strate-
gies might determine an overall visuospatial bias (Chokron
& Imbert, 1993), which might make a left-to-right or a right-
to-left SNARC effect more likely to be observed.
The first evidence in support of this assumption is pro-
vided in the study by Dehaene et al. (1993). In this study, the
authors performed nine experiments to examine how numer-
ical magnitudes are associated with spatial response codes.
The results of this work show that the SNARC effect did not
vary with handedness, or hemispheric dominance, but was
linked to the direction of writing. Specifically, a weaker
SNARC was found in Iranian participants (i.e., which read
words from right to left), which correlated to the number of
years they spent in France.
Subsequent studies have explored the SNARC effect with
other populations characterized by no left to right reading
habit such as Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese (Chan &
Bergen, 2005), Chinese (Hung, Hung, Tzeng, & Wu, 2008),
Russian-Hebrew (Shaki & Fischer, 2008), Palestinians and
Israelis (Shaki, Fischer, & Petrusic, 2009). These studies
suggest that different notations of the same quantity have
flexible mappings within space, which is plausibly shaped by
the dominant context in which the numerical notations
appear. However, the study by Shaki et al. (2009) showed
that the SNARC effect is only present when the reading
directions for numbers and words are consistent. In fact, the
authors found a SNARC effect only on Canadian (i.e., from
left to right) and Palestinian (i.e., from right to left) groups
while they failed in finding this effect in the Israeli group,
where the reading direction of words and digits are inconsis-
tent (i.e., words are read from right to left and numbers from
left to right).
SNARC seems also sensitive to finger counting strate-
gies. In fact, several works (e.g., Fischer, 2008; Fischer &
Brugger, 2011) have shown that sensorimotor practices, such
as finger counting routines, do play a fundamental role in
determining Spatial Numerical Associations. Interesting,
there is evidence suggesting a difference in counting strate-
gies between Western and Eastern populations. The recent
study by Lindemann, Alipour, and Fischer (2011) showed
that the 68% of the examined Western participants indicated
to map the numbers 1 to 5 onto fingers of the left hand,
whereas the 63.4% of the Middle Eastern participants

Random Movements Generation in
Western and Eastern Cultures
Carmelo Mario Vicario1,2,3, Giulia Sgubin2, and Anica Newman3
Abstract
Recent investigations document a space number association effect in decisional processes of left-to-right reading cultures.
Here, we expanded on this issue by studying motor decisional processes in a group of bilingual Iranians (i.e., which read
text from right to left and numbers from left to right) and a group of monolingual Australians, submitted to four different
numerical cues (i.e., digits written in Arabic, digits written in East Arabic, English number words, Farsi number words).
According to previous evidence, we found that both Arabic digits and English number words affect the performance of the
Australian participants; on the contrary, no effect has been reported for all four codes in the performance of the Iranian
participants. The current findings are discussed according to the absence of a consistence in the reading direction between
numbers and words (i.e., Iranian participants) as well as the specific Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI) adopted for displaying all four
codes.

reported an overall preference to start counting with the right
hand.
A space number association (SNA) like-effect has been
documented also at decisional level. For example, Loetscher,
Schwarz, Schubiger, and Brugger (2008) showed that lateral
head turning, which is known to affect spatial attention
(Schindler & Kerkhoff, 1997; Vicario, Martino, Pavone, &
Fuggetta, 2011), influences numerical selection in Western
participants asked to perform a Random Number Generation
(RNG) task. Specifically, while facing left, participants pro-
duced relatively small numbers, whereas while facing right,
they tended to produce larger numbers. Further work on
Western participants (Daar & Pratt, 2008; Vicario, 2012;
Shaki & Fischer, 2013) have documented a SNA like-effect
even in motor decision-making tasks, such as the generation
of random movement sequences. For example, Daar and
Pratt (2008) showed that low digits biased the voluntary
selection of typing with their left hand, whereas high digits
biased the voluntary selection of typing with their right hand.
Similar results were found (Vicario, 2012) by using a ran-
dom movement generation (RMG) paradigm (Jahanshahi &
Dirnberger, 1998). All these findings demonstrate that both
task-irrelevant sensory-motor manipulation (Loetscher et al.,
2008) as well as the exposure to numbers (Daar & Pratt,
2008; Vicario, 2012) predictably shift both abstract (i.e.,
numerical) and motor decisional processes, against the par-
ticipants' efforts to be casual.
In the current study, we investigated the effect of the read-
ing direction habit, suggested by a particular numerical code,
to the execution of a motor decisional task such as the RMG.
In particular, we tested the RMG (i.e., finger movement
selection) performance in a group of bilingual Iranians,
which are natively used not only to digits written in East
Arabic and Farsi language but also to both digits written in
Arabic and English (i.e., as their second language). In fact,
Iranian people habitually read Farsi texts from right to left,
but digits written in East Arabic from left to right. The choice
of testing RMG in Iranian participants also allowed to inves-
tigate any eventual effect related to their counting strategy
(i.e., right to left), which is the most likely in this culture (see
Lindemann et al., 2011). Moreover, our Iranian participants
were familiar with Arabic numbers and fluent with the
English language (see the "Participants" section for more
details), implying some familiarity with the left to right read-
ing. This is particularly relevant in the light of a recent study
(Rashidi-Ranjbar, Goudarzvand, Jahangiri, Brugger, &
Loetscher, 2014) showing that lateral head turning does not
affect the random number selection in Iranian participants
with a low familiarity with the left-to-right reading direction
habit (i.e., participants were "beginners" for the English lan-
guage). We also tested, with the same paradigm, a group of
monolingual Western participants (i.e., Australians partici-
pants). See Figure 1 for details about the visual codes used in
the study.
Through this study, we wanted to explore some theoreti-
cal aspects not previously addressed: (a) investigate whether
the familiarity with the left-to-right reading direction habit,
as might be argued from the results provided by Dehaene
et al. (1993), affects the RMG performance of Iranian par-
ticipants exposed to Arabic digits; (b) investigate whether
the exposure to English number words influences the RMG
performance as well as the exposure to number digits (Daar
& Pratt, 2008; Vicario, 2012); (c) investigate whether the
right-to-left finger counting strategy, which is more likely in
the Iranian sample (Lindemann et al., 2011), influences the
RMG performance, with a particular regard for the exposure
to Eastern numerical codes (i.e., East Arabic code and Farsi
number code). This last issue appears particularly relevant
given the adopted experimental paradigm (i.e., finger move-
ment's selection).
Participants and Method
Participants
Thirteen right-handed Iranian participants (6 men, 7 women,
M age = 27.92 ± 2.46 years) and 17 right-handed Australian
participants (control sample, 8 men, 9 women, M age = 23.5
± 3.22) with normal or corrected vision participated in the
research after providing written informed consent. Initially,
it was planned to recruit an equal number of participants for
both groups. However, this proved to be unachievable due to
the limited availability of Iranian participants at the
International School for Advanced Studies (Trieste, Italy).
Most of the Iranian participants were PhD students. All par-
ticipants were born in Iran from Iranian parents and had ini-
tially studied in their own country of origin, before living in
Italy. All participants were familiar with Arabic numbers and
fluent with the English language (the average number of
years elapsed since they started studying English was 19.54
± 2.50). Moreover, three participants had "beginner" knowl-
edge of the Italian language. The control group was recruited
at the University of Queensland, Brisbane (Australia), among
undergraduate and graduate students. We did not adopt sta-
tistical procedures for determining the sample size of
Figure 1. The four types of numerical cues (Arabic, East Arabic,
English numerical words, Farsi numerical words).

Australian participants. We decided to test 17 participants in
agreement of the previous study by Vicario (2012), which
has adopted the same task. Verbal informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The investigation has been
conducted according to the principles expressed in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Procedure and Instruments
Iranian participants were positioned 50 cm from an Olidata
computer 21 monitor configured at a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
Australian participants were positioned 50 cm from a Dell
computer 21 monitor configured at a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
Visual stimuli were presented in four separate blocks (coun-
terbalanced design) and were each composed of six numeri-
cal codes (low numbers: 1-2; middle numbers: 4-6; high
numbers: 8-9; size: 0.8° × 0.1°) written in Arabic, East
Arabic, English, or Farsi. Visual stimuli were casually pre-
sented according to an Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI) of 300
ms. This ISI, which marked the temporal pace for the random
finger movements selection task, was chosen according to
the evidence provided in a recent work (Vicario, 2012),
showing that numbers affect RMG performance only when
the ISI is set at 300 ms. Participants were explicitly asked to
synchronize their responses with the visual stimulus dis-
placement. In particular, they were asked to respond to
numerical cues presented on the computer screen by pressing
one among eight keys of the keyboard (left keys: A, S, D, F;
right keys: H, J, K, L) with one of their eight fingers (the
index, the middle, the ring, and the pinkie of both left and
right hands). Thus, the "go" signal to move a finger was rep-
resented by the numerical cue itself. The numerical cue dis-
appeared once the participant pressed the selected key. Each
block consisted of a total of 60 trials (10 per numerical cue)
displayed on the center of the computer screen. The depen-
dent variable was the frequency with which a finger move-
ment selection was made following the presentation of low
(1, 2), middle (4, 6), and high numbers (8, 9). All participants
were submitted to a training block of 30 trials before starting
the experimental session.
Data Analysis
The amount of finger movements generated with the left and
the right hand while looking at low, middle, and high num-
bers was analyzed via repeated-measures ANOVA. In par-
ticular, we were interested in investigating the effect of these
four codes on the RMG performance of our participants.
Thus, we performed a within-subjects analysis to address
questions discussed in the "Introduction" section. In particu-
lar, the within-subjects analysis consisted of two separated
ANOVA (one for each group), in which we compared the
RMG performance for all types of visual stimulus. Thus, for
each single ANOVA, we considered the following factors:
the numerical magnitude (i.e., low, middle, high), the type of
code (i.e., Arabic numbers, East Arabic numbers, English
number words, Farsi number words), and the Response
selection (left, right). Post hoc comparisons were performed
using t test. For all tests, the level of statistical significance
was set at p < .05. Data analysis was performed using
Statistica software, version 8.0, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA.
Results
Iranian Participants
The repeated-measures ANOVA did not reveal a significant
main effect for the type of code, F(3, 48) = 1.00, p > .05,
2 = 0.058,  = 0.255, and numerical magnitude factor,
F(2, 96) = 1.00, p > .05, 2 = 0.020,  = 0.219. However, the
response selection factor was significant, F(1, 48) = 15.4,
p = .001, 2 = 0.243,  = 0.970. In particular, participants
used the right fingers more (M = 10.58) frequently than left
fingers (M = 9.42). No significant results were reported for
the Type of code × Numerical magnitude interaction factor,
F(6, 96) = 1.00, p > .05, 2 = 0.058,  = 0.377, the Response
selection × Type of code interaction factor, F(3, 48) = 0.41, p
> .05, 2 = 0.025,  = 0.125, the Numerical magnitude ×
Type of code interaction factor, F(2, 96) = 0.90, p > .05, 2 =
0.001,  = 0.063, and the Numerical magnitude × Type of
code × Response selection interaction factor, F(6, 96) = 0.44,
p > .05, 2 = 0.026,  = 0.174. See Figure 2 for details about
the average movement frequency detected for all codes.
Australian Participants
The repeated-measures ANOVA did not reveal a significant
main effect for the Type of code, F(3, 64) = 0.0, p > .05, 2 =
-0.365,  = 2, and the numerical magnitude factor,
F(2, 128) = 0.0, p > .05, 2 = 1.134,  = 2. However, the
response selection factor was significant, F(1, 48) = 15.4, p
< .01, 2 = 0.12,  = 0.856. In particular, participants used the
right fingers more (M = 10.64) frequently than left fingers (M
= 9.36).
Talking about the interaction factors, no significant results
were reported for the Type of code × Numerical magnitude
interaction factor, F(6, 12) = 0.0, p > .05, 2 = -0.409,  = 2,
the Response selection × Type of code interaction factor,
F(3, 64) = 2.34, p > .05, 2 = 0.099,  = 0.563. However, we
detected a significant Numerical magnitude × Response
selection interaction factor, F(2, 128) = 3.63, p = .029, 2 =
0.053,  = 0.662. Post hoc analysis reveals that the right fin-
gers were used more frequently than left fingers when look-
ing at high (p < .001) and middle (p < .001) numbers while
this difference was not significant for low numbers
(p > .05). Finally, we detected a significant Numerical mag-
nitude × Type of code × Response selection interaction fac-
tor, F(6, 128) = 2.58, p = .023, 2 = 0.106,  = 0.830. Post hoc
analysis shows that, in the Arabic digits block, left fingers

were used more frequently than right fingers when looking at
low quantity (p = .007); vice versa, right fingers were moved
more frequently than left fingers when looking at high num-
bers (p = .007); a similar difference was reported also for the
English number words block. In particular, left fingers were
used more frequently than right fingers when looking at low
quantity (p = .038); vice versa, right fingers were moved
more frequently than left fingers when looking at high num-
bers (p = .038). No significant differences were detected for
the other East Arabic and the Farsi number codes. See
Figure 3 for details about the average movement frequency
detected for all codes.
Discussion
Several works recognize a central role to the reading direc-
tion habit in the mental assessment of numerical magnitude.
The SNARC effect has been considered the most relevant
experimental evidence in support of this view. However, this
role has been re-evaluated in the light of recent works (see
Fischer & Brugger, 2011, for a discussion on this argument).
For example, a recent study involving bilingual Russian-
Hebrew readers (Fischer, Shaki, & Cruise, 2009) has shown
that merely reading a single Cyrillic or Hebrew word,
changed their SNA from 1 s to the next, clearly indicating
that effects of reading are much more fragile than originally
thought (Fischer et al., 2009).
Several studies have documented a strict interaction
between motor system and numerical representation (Fischer,
Warlop, Hill, &, Fias, 2004; Badets & Pesenti, 2010, 2011)
as well as the relationship between quantity, space, and deci-
sional processes (Loetscher, Bockisch, Nicholls, & Brugger,
2010; Loetscher et al., 2008; Shaki & Fischer, 2013; Vicario,
2013). In this regard, spatial attention mechanisms might
play a key role in explaining these forms of interaction in the
human brain (Vicario, 2011; Vicario, Bonní, & Koch, 2011;
Vicario, Caltagirone, & Oliveri, 2007; Vicario & Martino,
2010; Vicario, Martino, & Koch, 2013; Vicario et al., 2008;
Vicario, Rappo, Pepi, & Oliveri, 2009; Vicario, Rappo, Pepi,
Pavan, & Martino, 2012). In fact, the mere sight of a number
would induce a spatial attentional bias, which depends on its
magnitude, with low numbers shifting attention to the left

and high numbers shifting attention to the right space
(Fischer, Castel, Dodd, & Pratt, 2003). This, in turn, could
influence spatially encoded decisional processes.
In two recent studies (Daar & Pratt, 2008; Vicario, 2012),
the authors investigated the random movement selection per-
formance, respectively, in Canadian and Italian participants
while looking at Arabic digits. The results showed that left
hand/fingers were moved more frequently while looking at
low with respect to high numerical digits. Vice versa, a
higher frequency in moving right hand/fingers while looking
at high with respect to low numerical digits was
documented.
In the current study, we used a RMG task to explore the
effect of four different numerical codes (i.e., Western vs.
Eastern) on the motor decisional processes of two groups of
participants (i.e., Iranians and Australians) to address the fol-
lowing arguments:
i. whether the RMG performance is affected by numer-
ical words as well as by digits (Daar & Pratt, 2008;
Vicario, 2012);
ii. (for the Iranian participants only) whether the high
familiarity with the Arabic number code and with a
language characterized by a left-to-right reading
direction (i.e., the English language) induces a
SNA effect in the RMG performance while looking
at Arabic numerical codes. This question is timely
in the light of the results recently provided by
Rashidi-Ranjbar et al. (2014) showing that the
modulation of spatial attention focus, via lateral
head turning, does not affect the RNG performance
of Iranian participants with a low familiarity with
the left-to-right reading habit, although previous
evidence in Western populations (Loetscher et al.,
2008);
iii. investigate whether the right-to-left finger counting
strategy, which is the most likely in Iranian sample
(Lindemann et al., 2011), might exert some kind of
influence in the current decision-making task, which
involves finger movements.
Results suggest,
i. The interaction between numbers and motor deci-
sional processes is specific for Western cultures and
does not affect the performance of the examined

Eastern culture (i.e., Iranians), despite their familiar-
ity with the Arabic code and the English language.
ii. Even numerical words affect RMG, although only in
the Western sample.
iii. The right-to-left finger counting strategy, which is
the most common in the Iranian sample (Lindemann
et al., 2011), does not affect performance in the exe-
cution of the current finger movements selection
task.
In detail, talking about the performance of the Australian
sample, we found that digits written in Arabic code affect the
RMG performance, like in previous works (Daar & Pratt,
2008; Vicario, 2012). In particular, we found that left hand
fingers were moved more frequently while looking at low
quantities and right hand fingers were moved more fre-
quently while looking at high quantities. This provides sup-
port to the reliability of the current quantity/motor
decision-making interaction across different Western cul-
tures (i.e., Canadian people, Daar & Pratt, 2008; Italian peo-
ple, Vicario, 2012; Australian people, in the current work).
Moreover, the effect sizes (i.e., medium effect size) reported
in the current work lead to argue that the current effect of
number on RMG has a fair reliability.
A novel result refers to the evidence of a similar effect on
RMG performance in association to the exposure to English
number words. This agrees with previous evidence showing
visuo-motor effects of both digits and number words
(Calabria & Rossetti, 2005) on the performance of healthy
humans. No effects on the RMG performance were reported
for the other two codes (i.e., digits written in East Arabic and
Farsi number words).
Finally, talking about the RMG performance of the Iranian
participants, no significant effects have been reported in
association to all four codes. This result leads to argue the
following remarks:
i. The familiarity with a left-to-right reading direction
habit (like in the case of our Iranian participants)
does not induce a SNA like-effect in the RMG,
although previous evidence (Dehaene et al., 1993)
shows that the familiarity with a left-to-right reading
direction habit (like in the case of our Iranian partici-
pants) leads likely the occurrence of a SNARC effect;
ii. the right-to-left counting strategy, which is the most
likely in Iranian people (see Lindemann et al., 2011),
results irrelevant in influencing the execution of the
current finger movements selection task.
Overall, the absence of a numbers/motor decisional pro-
cesses interaction in the Iranian sample corroborates the
reading direction inconsistency hypothesis proposed by
Shaki et al. (2009) documenting no SNA effect in popula-
tions (i.e., Israelis) characterized by a reading direction
inconsistency for word and digit numbers. In fact, a similar
reading direction inconsistency is also reported for the
Eastern codes used by Iranian populations (i.e., digits written
in East Arabic code are read from left to right; number words
written in Farsi are read from right to left). Alternatively, the
absence of effects in the RMG performance of the Iranian
sample could be due to the particular ISI (i.e., 300 ms)
selected for presenting the four different numerical codes in
the computer screen. In fact, this particular ISI was chosen
according to the result provided by Vicario (2012) with
Western participants (i.e., Italian participants). In particular,
one could hypothesize that Western codes (i.e., Arabic
numerical codes and English number words) did not affect
RMG of Iranian participants because the processing of these
two codes might have required a longer ISI to affect the
RMG performance. This suggestion is motivated by the rela-
tively lower familiarity of the Iranian participants with
Western codes (their exposure was limited to a school con-
text) compared with the Eastern codes. In this sense, we can-
not exclude that the current ISI might not be appropriate to
disclose any eventual effect played by the exposure to
Western codes on the RMG performance in the Iranian
sample.
Future works devoted in the investigation of this research
topic in right-to-left reading habit cultures might clarify this
issue by using longer ISI. Moreover, it would be critical that
the adoption of statistical procedures for determining, in
advance, the size of the samples to be tested, to verify the
research hypothesis. The absence of this procedure is cur-
rently a limit of our work.
