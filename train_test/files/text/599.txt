The current research drew upon the resource perspective (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000; ten Brummelhuis
& Bakker, 2012) and firstly focused on the reciprocal mediation relationship between schedule
control, work interference with family (WIF) and emotional exhaustion. First, the present study proposed
that WIF mediates the negative relationship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion, and
emotional exhaustion also mediates the negative relationship between schedule control and WIF. Second,
family time adequacy was expected to play an amplifying role in the first path of the two mediations.
Using a sample of 563 employees and adopting hierarchical linear modelling, the three-wave study first
revealed that the emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between schedule control and WIF
while WIF also mediates the schedule control-emotional exhaustion relationship, which demonstrated a
reciprocal mediation. Furthermore, the relationship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion,
as well as the indirect effects of schedule control on WIF via emotional exhaustion, were stronger for
employees with higher family time adequacy. Implications of the findings and future directions are
discussed.

As the two most important realms of adult life (Andrews
& Withey, 1976), work and family are sometimes incom-
patible with each other, which causes work-family conflict
(Frone, 2003; Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). Defined as `a
form of inter-role conflict in which the role pressures from
the work and family domains are mutually incompati-
ble in some respect' (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985, p. 77),
work-family conflict, including work interference with
family (WIF) and family interference with work (FIW),
was considered a destructive construct that brings nu-
merous adverse outcomes to individuals' work and life
(Bedeian, Burke, & Moffett, 1988; Burke, 1988; Frone,
Russell, & Cooper, 1992), such as low wellbeing (Diener &
Ryan, 2008), job dissatisfaction (Bacharach, Bamberger, &
Conley, 1991; Bedeian et al., 1988), depression (Frone et
al., 1992), absenteeism (Goff, Mount, & Jamison, 2006),
turnover intention (Nohe & Sonntag, 2014), and emo-
tional exhaustion (Pleck, Staines, & Lang, 1980).

more control over their work time and reduce employees'
WIF (Glass & Fujimoto, 1995; Thomas & Ganster, 1995).
However, compared to the more prevalent research on the
impact of other types of job control, such as decision-
making authority and skill discretion (Karasek, 1979; Van
der Doef & Maes, 1999), schedule control, which refers to
the flexibility of how much time is spentatworkandwhere
the work takes place (Thomas & Ganster, 1995), has rarely
been investigated (Kelly & Moen, 2007) within organisa-
tions. To date, schedule control is noticeably disconnected
from several important workplace outcomes, such as em-
ployees' emotional exhaustion, in the literature.
Moreover, beyond the work domain, although a
few cross-sectional studies provide preliminary evidences
about the negative association between schedule control
and work-family conflict (Beutell, 2010; Hughes & Parkes,
2007; Lapierre & Allen, 2012), how employees' control
over work schedules affects WIF, and how this impact re-
lates to employees' emotional exhaustion, is far from clear.
This is both a theoretical and practical void because, other
than job control on `how' to do the work, the control on

`when' and `where' to do the work also matters for both
individuals and organisations.
In the present study, which drew upon a resources
perspective (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000; ten Brummelhuis
& Bakker, 2012) and was based on the job demands-
resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007), a reciprocal
mediation model is expected regarding the relationship
among schedule control, WIF, and emotional exhaustion.
First, it is proposed that schedule control has an indirect
effect on their emotional exhaustion via WIF. Moreover,
it is also proposed that schedule control has an indirect
effect on their WIF via emotional exhaustion. In addition,
when employees have a high level of family time adequacy,
which refers to the time available for family (Van Horn,
Bellis, & Snyder, 2001), it is expected that a high level of
schedule control would be more genuine for employees,
and the negative effect of schedule control on emotional
exhaustion and WIF would both be strengthened. The
proposed model can be seen in Figure 1.
The investigation of the relationship between schedule
control and WIF will contribute to the demands-resources
model(Bakker&Demerouti,2007),theliteratureofwork-
family conflict and emotional exhaustion, and the prac-
tice of flexible work schedule policy in three ways. First,
through the hypothesised reciprocal mediation model, the
present study will not only explain the possible reciprocal
relationship between WIF and emotional exhaustion but
also give a clearer picture of the reciprocal mediation re-
lationship between schedule control, WIF, and emotional
exhaustion. Second, the incorporation of family time ade-
quacy will not only enrich the above picture by uncovering
a necessary condition outside of the workplace but also ex-
pand the scope of the demands-resources model (Bakker
& Demerouti, 2007) out of the work domain. Third, find-
ings of the current research will give organisations a clear
message about the importance of work time control for
employees, and a possible hint that employees' control of
family time also matters at work.
Theory Background and Hypothesis
Schedule Control, Work Interference With Family, and Emotional
Exhaustion
Compared to actual work schedule, schedule control de-
picts employees' perceived control over their work sched-
ules (Fenwick & Tausig, 2001). Drawing upon a resource
perspective(Grzywacz&Marks,2000;tenBrummelhuis&
Bakker, 2012) and job demands-resources model (Bakker
& Demerouti, 2007), I argue that there is a reciprocal
mediation between schedule control, WIF, and emotional
exhaustion. Specifically, schedule control not only has a
negative impact on employees' WIF through their emo-
tional exhaustion, but also negatively influences employ-
ees' emotional exhaustion via their WIF.
The core idea of the job demands-resources model
is that individuals experience psychological and physical
strain if job demands are high or resources are insufficient
(Bakker&Demerouti,2007).Workschedulecanbeseenas
a job demand that is imposed by the organisation (Beutell,
2010).Onthecontrary,schedulecontrol,whichfocuseson
when and where to do the job (Fenwick & Tausig, 2001),
can be seen as providing autonomy and a job resource
that allows employees to allocate their time and energy
more freely and efficiently. Thus, it is reasonable to argue
that if employees have a high level of schedule control,
they may experience fewer job demands and more job
resources, and, thus, have a lower level of job strain. As
a result, employees' emotional exhaustion, as a type of
psychological strain (Maslach & Jackson, 1981), would be
reduced. Therefore, it is predicted that:
Hypothesis 1. Schedule control is negatively associated
with emotional exhaustion.
Moreover, based on the work-home resources model
(ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), on the one hand, a
lack of resources in one domain may lead to depletion
of resources in another domain (i.e., loss spiral). On the
other hand, sufficient resources in one domain could pro-
duce resources foranotherdomain(i.e., gainspiral). Thus,
abundant resources in the workplace would not only re-
duce depletion of family resources but also spill over to
family domain and help individuals to deal better with
their family life (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000; ten Brum-
melhuis & Bakker, 2012). Thus, a high level of schedule
control on work would help to reduce work interference
with family. Therefore, it is predicted that:
Hypothesis 2. Schedule control is negatively associated
with work interference with family.
The resource perspective posits that individuals have a
finite amount of resources to use in all aspects of work and
life, and ineffective allocation of resources will lead to psy-
chological strain (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000). Based on the
demands-resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007),
emotionalexhaustioncanbeseenasaconsequenceofhigh
demands and few resources. Since work interference with
family is an indicator of personal resources (e.g., time)
insufficiency (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), it is reasonable
to expect that under a high level of work interference with
family, individuals' emotional exhaustion would also be
high. Moreover, emotional exhaustion could also be the
antecedent of resource depletion. This is because, in or-
der to cope with emotional exhaustion, employees have
to consume their limited resources (Schaufeli & Bakker,
2004). This can lead to a vicious cycle and leave insuf-
ficient resources available for family, which can trigger
WIF. Combining the above reasoning, it is likely that WIF
and emotional exhaustion have a reciprocal relationship.
Thus, it is predicted that:
Hypothesis 3. WIF and emotional exhaustion have a pos-
itive and reciprocal relationship over time.
To sum up, schedule control can act as a form of job
resources that helps employees to better manage their per-
sonal resources for family and leads to a low level of
WIF. The low level of WIF should cause less strain and

therefore a lower level of emotional exhaustion. Simulta-
neously, schedule control can also help individuals to gain
control and have less job strain, which should lead to a
lower level of emotional exhaustion. With a lower level
of emotional exhaustion, individuals would use fewer re-
sources to deal with their exhaustion, which would benefit
the family and reduce WIF. Thus, it is predicted that:
Hypothesis 4. WIF mediates the relationship between
schedule control and emotional exhaustion, while emo-
tional exhaustion mediates the relationship between
schedule control and work interference with family.
The Moderating Role of Family Time Adequacy
Based on the resources allocation theory (Grzywacz &
Marks, 2000) and conservation of resource theory (Hob-
foll,1989),tenBrummelhuisandBakker(2012)developed
a resource perspective on the work-family relationship,
namely the work-home resources model, and explained
how personal resources flow between work and family do-
mains. Combining the work-home resources model and
job demands-resources model, it is reasonable to argue
that family demands or resources, such as family time ad-
equacy, may also play a role in the relationship between
schedule control, emotional exhaustion, and WIF.
Family time adequacy refers to individuals' percep-
tion of time resources available for family (Van Horn
et al., 2001). Acting as a form of family resources, family
time adequacy and schedule control represent two parts
of personal resources in the work and family domains re-
spectively. Based on the work-home resources model (ten
Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), sufficient resources in one
domain may not only reduce depletion of resources in
another domain but also produce resources for another
domain. Thus, employees with high family time adequacy
not only have enough family time resources but may pro-
vide additional resources for work on the basis of the
existing resources from schedule control.
Given that a high level of schedule control would re-
duce the depletion of family resources and decrease WIF,
a high level of family time adequacy would strengthen
the negative effect of schedule control on WIF from both
work and family aspects. On the one hand, a high level
of family time adequacy, as an abundant family resource,
would help to enrich the whole family resources and make
it less easy to be depleted. On the other hand, this fam-
ily resource could also spill over to the work domain and
enrich the whole work resources, which would reduce the
depletion of resources in anther domain, such as family,
and finally reduce work interference with family. In other
words, I expect that a higher level of family time adequacy
would amplify the negative association between schedule
control and emotional exhaustion.
In contrast, employees who have a low level of family
time adequacy do not have enough family time resources.
Hence, based on the work-home resources model (ten
Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), they are more likely to
deplete the limited resource, especially time resources at
work, and cause the conflict between work and family.
Thus, employees with a low level of family time adequacy
would be less likely to have a low level of WIF when they
haveahigherlevelofschedulecontrolthantheircolleagues
with high family time adequacy. As proposed above, that
WIF mediates the relationship between schedule control
and emotional exhaustion, it is anticipated that family
time adequacy, as a family resource, will moderate the
indirect relationship between schedule control and WIF
through emotional exhaustion. Therefore, it is predicted
that:
Hypothesis 5a. Family time adequacy moderates the first
stage of the indirect relationship between schedule control
and emotional exhaustion via work interference with fam-
ily. Specifically, the negative relationship between schedule
controlandworkinterferencewithfamilyisstrongerwhen
family time adequacy is high.
Moreover, given that job resources are expected to be
associated with a low level of job strain, such as emo-
tional exhaustion, it is reasonable to argue that employees
with high family time adequacy, which act as an abundant
family resource, would be less likely to deplete their job
resources. Thus, they would be more likely to have a low
level of emotional exhaustion when they have a higher

level of schedule control than their colleagues with low
family time adequacy. In other words, it was expected that
a higher level of family time adequacy would amplify the
negative association between schedule control and emo-
tional exhaustion.
In contrast, employees with low family time adequacy
do not have enough time resources for the family. There-
fore, they are more likely to deplete resources at work and
thus perceive that fewer job resources are available than
employees with high family time adequacy. Given the as-
sociation between resources and strain, employees with
low family time adequacy would be more likely to have a
high level of emotional exhaustion regardless of the level
of schedule control. As proposed above, that emotional
exhaustion mediates the relationship between schedule
control and WIF, it is anticipated that family time ad-
equacy, as a family resource, will moderate the indirect
relationship between schedule control and WIF through
emotional exhaustion. Therefore, it is predicted that:
Hypothesis 5b. Family time adequacy moderates the first
stage of the indirect relationship between schedule con-
trol and work interference with family via emotional ex-
haustion. Specifically, the negative relationship between
schedule control and emotional exhaustion is stronger
when family time adequacy is high.
Method
Participants and Procedure
For this study, the data were collected as part of a large,
publicly available dataset called the Work, Family, and
Health Study (WFHS; Bray et al., 2013). The participants
were employed in the 14 centres of an extended health
care company. Employees who worked 22 or more hours
per week in direct patient care on the day or evening shifts
were eligible to participate in the present study. At baseline
(Time 1), 799 employees reported their schedule control
and family time adequacy. After 6 months, at Time 2, em-
ployees' emotional exhaustion and WIF were measured.
Finally, 12 months after Time 1, employees' emotional
exhaustion and WIF were measured at Time 3. Of the
799 participants, 563 (response rate = 70.46%) completed
the answer on the study variables of the current research
across all three waves. The average age of the 563 subjects
was 39.88 (SD = 12.19); 90.6% were female, 32.3% had a
high school degree, and 13% had a bachelor's degree or
above.
Measures
Schedule control. The measure of schedule control was
adopted from Thomas and Ganster's (1995) 14-item con-
trol scale. Eight items regarding control over work hours
were used. Participants were asked to think about what
they feel or believe is realistic for them and answered
questions about their control over work hours using a 5-
point Likert scale (from 1= strongly disagree to 5 = strongly
agree). A sample item is `How much choice do you have
over when you take vacations or days off?' The Cronbach's
alpha for the scale was .66.
Family time adequacy. Family time adequacy was mea-
sured with a seven-item scale adopted from the Family
Resource Scale -- Revised (FRS; Van Horn et al., 2001).
The original FRS consists of 30 items that assesses a family
member's perception of resources available for the fam-
ily. Participants were asked to rate their agreement on a
5-point Likert scale (from 1 = not at all adequate to 6 =
almost always adequate). A sample item is `To what extent
is there enough time to care for the needs of other fam-
ily members (spouse, parents, in-laws)?' The Cronbach's
alpha for the scale was .67.
Emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was mea-
sured by the three-item emotional exhaustion dimension
of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach & Jack-
son, 1986). Participants were asked to rate how their work
makes them feel on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1= never
to 7 = every day). A sample item is `You feel emotionally
drained from your work. How often do you feel this way?'
The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .89.
Work interference with family. Work interference with
family was measured by Netemeyer and Boles' (1996) five-
item, work-family conflict scale. Participants were asked
to think about the past 6 months and rate their agreement
on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to
5 = strongly agree). A sample item is `The demands of
your work interfere with your family or personal time'.
The Cronbach's alpha for time-based, strain-based and
behaviour-based WIF was .90.
Control variables. Participants' gender and age were con-
trolled in the current study, as they are found to affect
work-family conflict (Michel, Kotrba, Mitchelson, Clark,
& Baltes, 2011). Participants' sleep time was also con-
trolled, as enough and high-quality sleep were considered
to be an individual's important resource to deal with work
tasks (Diestel, Rivkin, & Schmidt, 2015). Sleep time was
measured at Time 1 by participants' self-reports on how
many hours they were sleeping per day on average.
Results
Preliminary Analysis
As all participants in the current study were working in
14 teams, it is possible that the nested data were non-
independent. Thus, intra-class coefficients (ICCs; Shrout
& Fleiss, 1979) of the study variables were computed. The
ICC1s, which indicate the variance explained by group
membership, were .05 for schedule control, .00 for family
time adequacy, .03 for Time 2 emotional exhaustion, .03
for Time 2 WIF, .01 for Time 3 emotional exhaustion,
and .01 for Time 3 WIF. The ICC2s, which indicate the
reliability of group means, were .68 for Time 1 schedule
control, .13 for Time 1 family time adequacy, .54 for
Time 2 emotional exhaustion, .53 for Time 2 WIF, .17 for
Time 3 emotional exhaustion, and .24 for WIF Time 3.
According to Kenny (1995), the ICC1s of .01 is considered

a small group effect, .10 is considered a medium group
effect, and .15 a large group effect. Since the ICC1s of
study variables in the current research ranged from .00
to .05 when treating the team as group variable, there was
considerable groupness regarding the current research
model. To eliminate the group effect, hierarchical linear
modelling (HLM) using Mplus 7 (Muth´
en & Muth´
en,
1998­2012) was adopted, and the group-level variances
of all study variables were controlled in the further
analysis.
Tests of Discriminant Validity
To examine whether key constructs and covariates in the
current study (i.e., schedule control, family time adequacy
at Time 1, emotional exhaustion and WIF at Time 2, and
emotional exhaustion and WIF at Time 3) were distin-
guishable from each other, a confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) using Mplus 7 (Muth´
en & Muth´
en, 1998­2012)
was conducted. CFA results indicated that the six-factor
measurement model (i.e., all variables are independent
of each other) fitted the data well, 2(419) = 1063.59,
p < .01, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .92, Tucker-Lewis
Index (TLI) = .91, Root Mean Square Error of Approxima-
tion (RMSEA) = .05. The six-factor model fitted the data
better than the three-factor model (in which variables in
the same wave were combined), 2(431) = 3146.87, p <
.01, CFI = .65, TLI = .62, RMSEA = .11, and one-factor
model (in which all variables were combined), 2(434) =
4098.65, p < .01, CFI = .53, TLI = .49, RMSEA = .12. These
results provided support for the discriminant validity of
the constructs in the present study.
Themeans,standarddeviations,correlationsandrelia-
bilities among the study variables are presented in Table 1.
Schedulecontrolwasnegativelyassociatedwithbothemo-
tional exhaustion and WIF at Time 2 (for emotional ex-
haustion, r = -.13, p < .01; for WIF, r = -.17, p < .01)
and Time 3 (for emotional exhaustion, r = -.15, p < .01;
for WIF, r = -.17, p < .01). Family time adequacy was also
negatively associated with both emotional exhaustion and
WIF at Time 2 (for emotional exhaustion, r = -.16, p <
.01; for WIF, r = -.28, p < .01) and Time 3 (for emotional
exhaustion, r = -.22, p < .01; for WIF, r = -.30, p <
.01). Moreover, schedule control was positively associated
with family time adequacy (r = .22, p < .01). Furthermore,
emotional exhaustion at Time 2 was positively associated
with WIF at Time 3 (r = .36, p < .01), while WIF at Time
2 was also positively associated with emotional exhaus-
tion at Time 3 (r = .37, p < .01). With respect to control
variables, gender was negatively correlated with emotional
exhaustion at both Time 2 (r = -.13, p < .01) and Time
3 (r = -.18, p < .01), and WIF at both Time 2 (r = -.15,
p < .01) and Time 3 (r = -.11, p < .01). Sleep time was
positive related with schedule control at Time 1 (r = .08, p
< .05) and negatively correlated with emotional exhaus-
tion at Time 2 (r = -.09, p < .05). Thus, gender, age, and
sleep time were controlled in the further analysis.
Hypothesis Tests
To examine the role of family time adequacy in the re-
lationship between schedule control and WIF via emo-
tional exhaustion and in the relationship between sched-
ule control and emotional exhaustion via WIF, the `first
stage moderation model' approach (Edwards & Lambert,
2007), in which the moderating effect takes place on the
first stage of the indirect effect of an independent vari-
able on a dependent variable through a mediator, was
used in the current study. In the present research model,
emotional exhaustion plays a mediating role in the rela-
tionship between schedule control and WIF, while WIF
also plays a mediating role in the relationship between
schedule control and emotional exhaustion. Family time
adequacy moderated the path from both schedule con-
trol to emotional exhaustion and the path from schedule
control to WIF. Thus, there were two conditional indirect
effects of schedule control on both WIF and emotional
exhaustion at different levels of family time adequacy. In
addition, the path analysis of structural equation mod-
elling (SEM) and HLM approach of Mplus 7 (Muth´
en &
Muth´
en, 1998­2012) were used to estimate the proposed
research model, while including the group level variances
into the analysis to rule out the possible group effect.
Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 proposed that sched-
ule control negatively associated with both WIF and emo-
tional exhaustion, after controlling for gender, age and
sleep time, and the direct and negative effect of schedule
control on Time 2 emotional exhaustion was significant
(estimate = -.27, SE = .11, p < .01, 95% CI [-.49, -.05]).
Similarly, the direct and negative effect of schedule control
on Time 2 WIF was also significant (estimate = -.19, SE
= .05, p < .01, 95% CI [-.28, -.11]). Thus, Hypothesis 1
and Hypothesis 2 were both supported.
Hypothesis 3 proposed a cross-lagged reciprocal re-
lationship and Hypothesis 4 proposed a reciprocal me-
diation. Reciprocal effect and reciprocal mediation were
tested using the analytic procedure of reciprocal relation-
ships from Griffin (1997) and Meier and Spector (2013).
Four time-lagged paths are needed to calculate the pos-
sible reciprocal relationship between variable X and Y at
two time points, including path Time 1 X to Time 2 Y,
path Time 1 X to Time 2 X, path Time 1 Y to Time 2
X, and path Time 1 Y to Time 2 Y. A reciprocal effect
is demonstrated if the path from Time 1 X to Time 2 Y,
while controlling for Time 1 Y, and the path from Time 1
Y to Time 2 X, while controlling for Time 1 X, are both
significant (Lian, Ferrin, Morrison, & Brown, 2014; Meier
& Spector, 2013). Addressing the above strategy, a recip-
rocal mediation in the current study is considered valid
if the path from the Time 1 schedule control to Time 3
emotional exhaustion via Time 2 WIF, while controlling
for Time 2 emotional exhaustion, and the path from Time
1 schedule control to Time 3 WIF via Time 2 emotional
exhaustion, while controlling for Time 2 WIF, are both
significant.

graduate, 4 = college 1­3 years (some college or technical school), 5 = college 4 years or more (college graduate). p < .05; p < .01.
First, after incorporating gender, age, and sleep time
as controls, the direct effect from Time 2 WIF to Time 3
emotional exhaustion, while controlling for Time 2 emo-
tional exhaustion (estimate = .13, SE = .05, p < .01, 95%
CI [.04, .23]), and the direct effect from Time 2 emotional
exhaustion to Time 3 WIF, while controlling for Time 2
WIF (estimate = .05, SE = .02, p <.05, 95% CI [.00, .09]),
were both significant, which indicated a cross-lagged re-
ciprocal effect. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.
Next, after incorporating gender, age, and sleep time
as controls, the direct effect from Time 1 schedule control
to Time 3 emotional exhaustion (estimate = -.15, SE
= .05, p < .01, 95% CI [-.25, -.04]) and Time 3 WIF
(estimate = -.08, SE = .04, p < .05, 95% CI [-.15, .00])
were both significant. After incorporating Time 2 WIF and
Time 2 emotional exhaustion as mediators and controls
respectively, the direct effect from Time 1 schedule control
to Time 3 emotional exhaustion was still significant but
weaker (estimate = -.12, SE = .06, p < .05, 95% CI [-.23,
-.01]), and the direct effect from Time 1 schedule control
to Time 3 WIF was not significant (estimate = -.07, SE
= .04, ns, 95% CI [-.14, .01]). The indirect effect from
Time 1 schedule control to Time 3 emotional exhaustion
via Time 2 WIF, while controlling for Time 2 emotional
exhaustion (estimate = -.03, SE = .01, p < .05, 95% CI
[-.05, .00]), and the indirect effect from Time 1 schedule
control to Time 3 WIF via Time 2 emotional exhaustion,
while controlling for Time 2 WIF (estimate = -.01, SE =
.01, p = .05, 95% CI [-.03, .00]), were both significant.
The proportion of mediation effect was 20% for the path
from schedule control to Time 3 emotional exhaustion via
Time 2 WIF, and was 15.67% for the path from schedule
control to Time 3 WIF via Time 2 emotional exhaustion.
Thus, Hypothesis 4 was supported.
Following the procedure suggested by Preacher et al.
(2007), the proposed moderated mediation hypotheses
(Hypothesis 4) was examined. As shown in Table 2, the
results first revealed that the schedule control-family time
adequacy interactive effect on Time 2 emotional exhaus-
tion was significant (estimate = -.37, SE = .11, p < .01,
95% CI [-.58, -.16]), but not significant on Time 2 WIF
(estimate = -.07, SE = .08, ns, 95% CI [-.23, .08]). A
simple slopes test at ±1 standard deviation of family time
adequacy was also performed, the results of which are pre-
sented in Figure 2. Schedule control was negatively related
to emotional exhaustion for employees with high family
time adequacy (+1 SD; estimate = -.43, SE = .12, p < .01,
95% CI [-.67, -.18]), but not significant for employees
with low family time adequacy (-1 SD; estimate = .04, SE
= .13, ns, 95% CI [-.22, .30]).
Moreover, a moderated mediation index (Hayes, 2013)
showed that family time adequacy significantly moder-
ated the indirect effect of schedule control on Time 3 WIF
through Time 2 emotional exhaustion (estimate = -.02,
SE = .01, p = .05, 95% CI [-.03, .00]). Specifically, the
indirect effect was significant when family time adequacy
was high (+1 SD, estimate = -.02, SE = .01, p < .05,
95% CI [-.04, -.001]), and was not significant when
family time adequacy was low (-1 SD, estimate = .00, SE
= .01, ns, 95% CI [-.01, .02]). However, the moderat-
ing effect of family time adequacy on the indirect effect
from schedule control to Time 3 emotional exhaustion via
Time 2 WIF was not significant (moderated mediation
index = -.01, SE = .01, ns, 95% CI [-.02, .01]). Thus,
Hypothesis 5b was supported, and Hypothesis 5a was not
supported.
Discussion
Drawing upon the resources perspective (Grzywacz &
Marks, 2000; ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012) and job
demands-resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007),
the current research examined the relationship between
schedule control, WIF and emotional exhaustion, and
the moderating role of family time adequacy. Specifically,
time-lagged data were collected to examine whether WIF
mediates the relationship between schedule control and
emotional exhaustion and whether emotional exhaustion
mediates the relationship between schedule control and
WIF; and further, whether family time adequacy moder-
atestheindirectrelationshipbetweenschedulecontroland
WIF via emotional exhaustion, and the indirect relation-
ship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion
via WIF.

The findings of the current research first supported the
research hypotheses of reciprocal mediation. Consistent
with the resources perspective (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000;
ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012) and the job demands-
resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007), research
results first showed that WIF mediates the relationship be-
tween schedule control and emotional exhaustion. More-
over, emotional exhaustion also mediates the relationship
between schedule control and work-family conflict. These
results suggest that employees with a high level of con-
trol over their work schedule, as a job resource, would
simultaneously have a low level of work-family conflict
through the decrease of job strains such as emotional ex-
haustion, and have a low level of emotional exhaustion via
the decrease of WIF.
Furthermore, the findings of the current research also
provide support for the moderating role of family time ad-
equacy in the relationship between schedule control, WIF
and emotional exhaustion. First, family time adequacy
had a significant moderating effect on the relationship be-
tween schedule control and WIF. Then a moderated medi-
ation analysis revealed that the indirect effect of schedule
control on emotional exhaustion via WIF was stronger
for employees with a high level of family time adequacy.
Second, family time adequacy had a significant moder-
ating effect on the relationship between schedule control
and emotional exhaustion. Then a moderated mediation
analysis revealed that the indirect effect of schedule con-
trol on WIF via emotional exhaustion was stronger for
employees with a high level of family time adequacy.
Theoretical and Practical Implications
The current research contributes to the existing litera-
ture on both the work-family relationship and the job
demands-resources model in two ways. First, the present
study found a reciprocal relationship between WIF and
emotional exhaustion over time; and, based on this, re-
vealed a reciprocal mediation between schedule control,

WIF,andemotionalexhaustion.Consistentwiththework-
homeresourcesmodel(tenBrummelhuis&Bakker,2012),
schedule control, as a job resource that could be spilled
over to family, is not only associated with emotional ex-
haustion through the impact of WIF, but correlated to
WIF via the effect of emotional exhaustion. The reciprocal
path between emotional exhaustion and WIF uncovered
a vicious circle of resource depletion between work and
family, and the incorporation of schedule control could
turn the vicious circle to a positive cycle.
Second, the current research extends the scope of
demands-resources model domain (Bakker & Demerouti,
2007), since the traditional demands-resources model is
only within organisations. The current study incorporated
family time adequacy as a boundary condition and found
that the impact of schedule control on emotional exhaus-
tion depends on the level of family time adequacy. This
results suggest that the traditional demands-resources
model needs to be more comprehensively constructed.
Specifically, looking at the antecedents of organisational
outcomes, the demands-resources model should simul-
taneously and naturally contain both demands and re-
sources from work and family.
The current study also provides empirical support for
the work-home resources model. While ten Brummelhuis
and Bakker (2012) released eight propositions regarding
the resources-based, work-family balance, they called for
a validity test of the proposed model. As found in the
current study, family time adequacy, a form of family re-
sources, would strengthen the negative relationship be-
tween schedule control (i.e., a form of job resources) and
emotional exhaustion. This result supports a unified view
of personal resources across domains of work and family.
Sufficient resources in one domain would trigger a gain
spiral and produce more resources for another domain,
while insufficient resources in one domain would bring a
loss spiral and deplete resources of another domain.
The hypothesis of the moderating effect of family time
adequacyintherelationshipbetweenschedulecontroland
WIF was not supported. A possible explanation could be
that compared to spilling over to the work domain and
strengthening the effect of schedule control on emotional
exhaustion, the effect of family time adequacy on WIF
may be parallel with the effect of schedule control. As can
be seen in Table 2, while the effect of family time adequacy
on emotional exhaustion was significant (estimate = -.37,
p < .01), the effect of schedule control was not significant
(estimate = -.19, ns). Given the significant interaction
(estimate = -.37, p < .01), these results indicated that the
effect of schedule control was highly influenced by fam-
ily time adequacy. However, although the effect of family
time adequacy on WIF was significant (estimate = -.36,
p < .01), the effect of schedule control on WIF was signif-
icant too (estimate = -.13, p < .01), indicating a parallel
effect.
The findings of the current study offer several prac-
tical implications. First, considering the positive effect of
work schedule control on reducing emotional exhaustion
and work-family conflict, organisations should promote
a flexible work schedule policy. Second, since recipro-
cal mediation exists between schedule control, emotional
exhaustion and WIF, if organisations have difficulties
making work schedules more flexible, in order to reduce
employees' work-family conflict, they could try other pos-
sible ways, such as relaxation classes, to help employees
to relieve their emotional exhaustion. Similarly, in or-
der to reduce employees' emotional exhaustion, organisa-
tions could try to help employees to reduce their conflicts
with time, strain, and behaviour between work and family
(Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). Third, organisations should
not only pay attention to employees' work schedules, but
also to their perceived adequacy of family time. Since in-
sufficient family time would weaken the effect of schedule
control on emotional exhaustion, target treatment such as
time management training is needed for employees with
low family time adequacy.
Limitations And Future Directions
There were also some limitations in the current research.
First, drawing upon a resources perspective (Grzywacz &
Marks, 2000; ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), it was ar-
gued that emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship
between schedule control and WIF, and WIF mediates the
relationship between schedule control and emotional ex-
haustion. Although time is one of the most important re-
sources that an individual can possess (Nielsen, Bachrach,
Sundstrom, & Halfhill, 2012), there are also other forms
of resources, such as feedback and social support (Bakker
& Demerouti, 2007; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Future re-
search could address this point and examine other forms
of job resources and its relationship with emotional ex-
haustion and work-family conflict. A similar suggestion
is that future studies could examine other forms of re-
sources at home such as family support (Adams, King, &
King, 1996) and its interactive effect with job resources on
workplace or, more generally, life outcomes.
Second, since work-family conflict was theoretically
grouped into three subdimensions, namely time-based,
strain-based, and behavioural-based work-family con-
flicts (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), future research could
investigate the impact of both schedule control and fam-
ily time adequacy on all three dimensions of work-family
conflict to see if there would be a difference. For example,
the impact of schedule control on time-based and strain-
based work-family conflict may be stronger than that of
behaviour-based work-family conflict because schedule
control is closer to the time and strain sources of con-
flict. Finally, the sample used in the current study was
from a large health care centre and the majority of partici-
pants were female. Future studies could use more gender-
balanced samples in other industries to test the generalis-
ability of the current research model.

Schedule Control and Work-Family Conflict
Conclusion
In summary, the current research drew upon the resources
perspective (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000; ten Brummelhuis
& Bakker, 2012) and the job demands-resources model
(Bakker & Demerouti, 2007) to investigate the reciprocal
mediation relationship between schedule control, WIF,
and emotional exhaustion. The findings first revealed that
emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between
schedule control and WIF, while WIF also mediates the
schedule control-emotional exhaustion relationship. In
addition, the mediation path of schedule control to work-
family conflict via emotional exhaustion was stronger for
employees with a high level of family time adequacy. With
these findings on the resource-based process of the rela-
tionship between schedule control and work-family con-
flict, and suggested future directions, the current study
contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of
the mechanism of the impact of personal resources on
individual and organisational outcomes.
