Population ageing is rapidly becoming a global issue and will have a
major impact on health policies and programmes. The World Health
Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) aims
to address the gap in reliable data and scientific knowledge on ageing
and health in low- and middle-income countries. SAGE is a longitu-
dinal study with nationally representative samples of persons aged
50þ years in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa,
with a smaller sample of adults aged 18­49 years in each country for
comparisons. Instruments are compatible with other large
high-income country longitudinal ageing studies. Wave 1 was con-
ducted during 2007­2010 and included a total of 34 124 respondents
aged 50þ and 8340 aged 18­49. In four countries, a subsample con-
sisting of 8160 respondents participated in Wave 1 and the 2002/04
World Health Survey (referred to as SAGE Wave 0). Wave 2 data
collection will start in 2012/13, following up all Wave 1 respondents.
Wave 3 is planned for 2014/15. SAGE is committed to the public re-
lease of study instruments, protocols and meta- and micro-data:
access is provided upon completion of a Users Agreement available
through WHO's SAGE website (www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/
sage) and WHO's archive using the National Data Archive application
(http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/surveydata).

Data resource basics
Few low- and middle-income countries have data on
levels and distribution of health and disability among
the older population, much less on which morbidity
trajectory their respective ageing populations are fol-
lowing: expansion of morbidity, where people
are living longer with more disease and disability;1,2
compression of morbidity, where longevity increases
but with delays in the age at onset and progression of
disease;3,4 or a dynamic equilibrium, where longevity
and disability rates both increase, but the severity of
disability is not as severe.5,6 Large-scale longitudinal
research in multiple settings is required to provide
comparable information on health and well-being,
as well as to track the impact of health interventions
and policies within and across countries. The World
Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing
and adult health (SAGE) aims to address this gap
with a global perspective. Its core consists of national
longitudinal studies of older people in six lower- and
upper-middle-income countries, complemented by
research collaborations with existing local
population-based research studies, comparisons with
other domestic ageing studies, and also comparisons
to studies outside these six countries.
SAGE is a longitudinal study with nationally repre-
sentative samples of persons aged 50þ years in China,
Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and
South Africa (see Figure 1), with comparison samples
of younger adults aged 18­49 years in each country.
The main aim is to generate valid, reliable and
comparable information on a range of health and
well-being outcomes of public health importance, in
adult and older adult populations. The core SAGE
countries provide a broad representation from different
geographic regions of the world, different levels of eco-
nomic development and different stages in the demo-
graphic and health transition, and include the two
most populous countries of the world. SAGE is also
designed to provide results that are comparable to
ageing studies in high-income countries, such as the
US Health and Retirement Study (http://hrsonline.isr.
umich.edu/), the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing
(www.ifs.org.uk/elsa/) and the Collaborative Research
on Ageing in Europe (COURAGE in Europe) Project
(www.courageproject.eu/) in three countries.
Data resource area and population
coverage
Face-to-face interviews conducted in China (2008­
10), Ghana (2008­09), India (2007­08), Mexico
(2009­10), the Russian Federation (2007­10) and
South Africa (2007­08). Half the interviews in
China were completed using a computer-assisted
Figure 1 World map showing SAGE and SAGE sub-studies, by collaborating country
1640 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
personal interview (CAPI) and the other half using
paper and pencil. SAGE Mexico used CAPI through-
out and the other four countries used paper and
pencil format for all interviews.
Multistage cluster sampling strategies were used in all
countries where, except for Mexico, households were
classified into one of two mutually exclusive categories:
(1) all persons aged 50 years and older were selected
from households classified as `50þ households'; and
(2) one person aged 18­49 years was selected from a
household classified as an `18­49 household'. The ar-
rangement in Mexico was similar, but included supple-
mentary and replacement samples to account for losses
to follow up in selected sampling units since Wave 0
(more sampling details provided when accessing the
data through http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/
surveydata/index.php/catalog). The sample in India is
also representative at the sub-national and sub-state
levels for the selected states. Household enumerations
were carried out for the final sampling units. One house-
hold questionnaire was completed per household--
where a household informant and individual respond-
ent need not be the same individual. One individual was
selected from 18­49 households, whereas for 50þ
households all individuals aged 50þ were invited to
complete the individual interview. Proxy respondents
were identified for selected individuals who were
unable to complete the interview. Household-level
analysis weights and person-level analysis weights
were calculated for each country, which included
sample selection and a post-stratification factor. Post-
stratification correction techniques used the most
recent population estimates provided by the national
statistical offices. The pooled Wave 1 six-country totals
for individual respondents included 34 124 respondents
aged 50þ and 8340 aged 18­49 (Table 1).

respondents for Wave 1. Both samples are new, and do not include any Wave 0 follow-up respondents.
bThe India sample for Wave 1 includes a large number of women aged 18­49 as part of a nested study, subsidized by the SAGE
India team.
THE WHO SAGE STUDY 1641
SAGE also includes two longitudinal sub-studies to
develop further hypotheses, assess the effects of
interventions and study specific populations, based
on collaborations with existing demographic and
health surveillance systems fieldsites and local
community studies. The SAGE collaboration with
the International Network for the Demographic
Evaluation of Populations and Their Health in de-
veloping countries (INDEPTH; www.indepth-network.
org) involves collaboration with eight fieldsites in
eight countries.7­9 One round of data collection took
place in 2007, with a second round planned to start in
2013 (see Box 1). In addition, SAGE includes collab-
oration with Medical Research Centre Uganda,
Uganda, and the Africa Centre for Population and
Health, South Africa, building upon existing studies,
to prospectively examine the direct and indirect ef-
fects of HIV/AIDS on the health and well-being of
older people.10,11 Wave 1 was completed in 2009/10,
with a second wave planned in late 2012/13 (see Box
2). Further sub-studies include the validation of
self-reported physical activity against accelerometry
measures in older adults (paa2012.princeton.edu/pa-
pers/122841), the assessment of happiness through
different versions of the Day Reconstruction
Method,12,13 and the validation of self-reported
chronic conditions through confirmatory medical tests.
Survey frequency
During 2002­04, WHO coordinated the World Health
Survey (WHS), a health interview survey in 70 coun-
tries of adults aged 18þ years, including the six SAGE
countries. The WHS samples were drawn from a cur-
rent national sampling frame using a stratified,
multi-stage cluster design so as to allow each
Box 1 SAGE collaboration with demographic and health surveillance systems field sites
(SAGE-INDEPTH)
INDEPTH is a network of local longitudinal demographic surveillance studies in 19 countries in Africa, Asia,
Central America and Oceania based on health and socio-demographic surveillance within defined areas.
Four African and four Asian Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) field sites were included
in a study of persons aged 50þ as part of a research collaboration with WHO SAGE.8 The data represent the
total population aged 50þ in six HDSS sites: Agincourt (South Africa), Ifakara (Tanzania), Nairobi (Kenya),
FilaBavi (Viet Nam), Purworejo (Indonesia) and Vadu (India); and a random sample of people aged 50þ in
the two remaining HDSS sites, Navrongo (Ghana) and Matlab (Bangladesh). SAGE-INDEPTH Wave 1 data
were collected in 2007, from which a pooled sample of 43 935 respondents aged 50þ (24 434 women and
19 501 men) was produced.9 The overall response rate was 75%. The eight fieldsites implemented an adapted
version of the standard SAGE modules. Socio-economic and demographic information was taken from the
HDSS site datasets. SAGE-INDEPTH Wave 2 is planned for late 2013. A special volume of publications was
published in 2010 (www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/issue/view/408).
The full SAGE questionnaire was also implemented in sub-samples of persons aged 50 years and over in
Agincourt (N ¼ 425), Navrongo (N ¼ 594) and Vadu (N ¼ 375). Data from these fieldsites can also be com-
pared with SAGE national samples in overlapping countries (South Africa, Ghana and India) to assess
plausibility of findings and generalizability, as well as to generate new hypotheses that can be more inten-
sively studied at the INDEPTH fieldsites before incorporating these components into future rounds of SAGE
in national samples.
Box 2 SAGE collaboration with existing local longitudinal studies (SAGE-HIV)
The SAGE sub-study on the effects of HIV on older people's health and well-being, with special attention to
the effects of antiretroviral therapy, includes two collaborations and was implemented in 2009/10. The
samples consist of HIV-positive people aged 50þ years, and HIV-negative older people indirectly affected
by the HIV/AIDS epidemic because their children are living with or died of HIV. The sub-studies are led by
the Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute (510 people aged 50þ years, including
198 who are living with HIV)10 and the Africa Centre for Population and Health Studies (Africa Centre),
situated in the Mpukunyoni tribal area, Hlabisa sub-district, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (422 par-
ticipants aged 50þ years, 203 people living with HIV).11 The SAGE modules for health and functioning,
chronic conditions, risk factors, health care utilization and caregiving were used during interviews.
Respondent characteristics, living conditions, household assets and income, transfers and social networks
were included. Anthropometric measures and blood samples were collected.

household and individual respondents to be assigned
a known non-zero probability of selection.14 Pooling
the data from the six SAGE countries resulted in
18 883 respondents aged 50 and over and 44 554
aged 18­49 years; this sample is referred to as
SAGE Wave 0.
SAGE Wave 0 samples were revisited in SAGE Wave
1 in four countries, resulting in a longitudinal data
set of 8160 respondents in total. In India, all people
aged 50 years and older were revisited in Wave 1. In
Ghana, Mexico and the European region of the
Russian Federation, a randomly selected sub-set was
followed up. All added random samples of new
respondents to the Wave 0 samples. China and
South Africa interviewed only newly selected respond-
ents--with China using an entirely new sampling
frame based on the national non-communicable dis-
ease (NCD) surveillance system and South Africa
updating the Wave 0 sampling frame and then select-
ing all new respondents. The Russian Federation
added new respondents from its Asian region and
the South Federal Districts of the European part of
country. The data from Waves 0 and 1 were linked
based on unique household and individual identifiers,
and location, age and sex. Age and sex variables were
verified case by case. Every household in the study
has location coordinates available through the use of
a Global Positioning System (GPS) device as part of
the interview process at both points in time.
Response rates were generally high in Wave 1 (see
Table 1). In Mexico, response rates were lowest, partly
because of the short time available for the field work
which did not allow sufficient time for multiple re-
visits if the respondent was not at home at the initial
visit. The revised sampling targets and long interval
between data collection efforts (on average 6 years)
contributed to high attrition between SAGE Wave 0
and Wave 1 (Table 1). Mexico had the highest loss to
follow-up between Waves 0 and 1: 45% out of 3188
sampled Wave 0 respondents were interviewed in
Wave 1. Only 676 refused or did not complete the
interview, whereas the remaining 1082 could not be
located (31.0%), had died (2.3%) or were otherwise
not enrolled in Wave 1. In future Waves, follow-up
rates are expected to be considerably higher because
of the shorter time interval and the design measures
employed in Wave 1.
Wave 2 will be implemented in 2012/13 and Wave 3
in 2014/15.
Measures
A standardized survey instrument, set of methods,
interviewer training and translation protocols are
used in all SAGE countries. The SAGE household
questionnaire consists of (1) a household roster
and modules about the dwelling, income, transfers
in and out of the household, assets and expenditures;
(2) an individual questionnaire with modules on
health and its determinants, disability, work history,
risk factors, chronic conditions, caregiving, subjective
well-being, health care utilization and health systems
responsiveness; (3) a proxy questionnaire about
health, functioning, chronic conditions and health
care utilization; (4) a verbal autopsy module question-
naire to ascertain the probable cause of death for
deaths in the household in the 24 months prior
to interview or between interview waves; and (5)
appendices including showcards to assist with the
interviews. In addition, SAGE Wave 1 included
anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist
and hip circumferences), blood pressure measures and
a blood sample via finger prick, and performance tests
including near and distant vision, a timed 4-m walk,
grip strength, lung function and cognition.
International standards were used to harmonize
education levels15 and occupations.16 Table 2 presents
a summary of the main measurements included in
SAGE Waves 0 and 1.
Data resource use
Some illustrative results are presented about health
status and various predictors, cross-sectionally by
country and age, and also the change in overall
health over time. The analyses presented here focus
on the assessment of health state: a multidimensional
construct consisting of eight health domains includ-
ing affect, cognition, interpersonal relationships,
mobility, pain, self-care, sleep/energy and vision.
A single composite health score was constructed
from responses to self-reported difficulties in the
eight domains. Data were scored using item response
theory, and a partial credit model was used to calcu-
late the composite health score, ranging from 0
(poor health) to 100 (good health).17
Figure 2 presents the overall health status by age
and income group for SAGE Wave 0. Across all coun-
tries there is a consistent decline in health across the
age spectrum, with respondents in China in better
health and respondents from India in worse health
as compared with the other countries. The sharpest
decline with age in Wave 0 is seen in Russia. The
differences by country are smallest between the ages
of about 50 and 75 years. This same inter-country
pattern was seen when using a single self-reported
overall general health question (of the type, `In gen-
eral, how would you rate your health today?').
The declines in health status in respondents who
were assessed at both Wave 0 and Wave 1 were com-
pared and predictors for decline between the two
waves generated using a generalized estimating
equation regression model.18 Figure 3 shows the
mean health score results for respondents aged 50þ
years from four SAGE countries pooled across Waves
0 and 1. Age gradients in health status are seen in
both waves of the survey (with women being in
consistently worse health than men across all age

somewhat level for the decade between the ages of
50 and 60 years, after which an increase in decline
with age is evident.
Table 3 includes the results from a longitudinal
analysis of 8160 respondents from Ghana, India,
Mexico and Russia to identify the main predictors
for decline in health over time. Age is clearly the
strongest predictor of decline in health status, with
older adults having a much more significant decline
in health over time than their younger counterparts.
Women's health state declines significantly more
rapidly than men's health state between Wave 0
and Wave 1. Those with chronic illnesses and comor-
bidity show a much more rapid decline in health than
those with no chronic conditions. Smokers also have
a significantly higher decline in health, but not heavy
alcohol drinkers. Those with higher levels of
education and from higher wealth quintiles have a
significantly slower decline in health. The decline in
health was largest in the Indian respondents, and
smaller among respondents from Mexico--which is
also borne out in the differences in life expectancy
at age 60 in the four countries.
Strengths and weaknesses
This is the first longitudinal study on health and
ageing in multiple low- and middle-income countries.
The six surveys have nationally representative sam-
ples, and will yield results that will be comparable
to those of similar ageing surveys in high-income
countries. Initial response rates were fairly good.
GPS coordinates have been taken from all households

Wave 2 in 2012/13 and Wave 3 in 2014/15. Funding
has been secured for Waves 2 and 3 of data collection,
with possible opportunities to expand the number of
participating countries.
The study is coordinated by WHO in close collabor-
ation with leading research institutions in the respect-
ive countries, with variable levels of involvement of
the national health authorities. The latter is particu-
larly critical to the overall success and strategic use of
the results. The collection of a range of biological and
clinical markers in addition to a very comprehensive
interview is an asset.
The SAGE collaborations with local health and
demographic surveillance studies or systems provide
an opportunity to link non-fatal health outcomes data
to information from demographic surveillance, such
as risk factors, mortality and migration, and track
these populations over time. Data from these sites
and systems can be compared with SAGE national

new hypotheses that can be more intensively studied
using surveillance field sites before incorporating
these components into future rounds of SAGE in
national samples.
Weaknesses are related to the potential high attri-
tion rates that often characterize national longitudinal
sample surveys. The duration of the interview is long
(mean time for Wave 1 was 2.5 h), as multiple dimen-
sions of health and well-being are measured, which
may be particularly demanding for both respondents
and interviewers. This may affect the data quality,
although no systematic problems have been detected
so far. In several countries, urban dwellers more often

THE WHO SAGE STUDY 1647
refused to participate in the survey, as is the case in
other population surveys internationally. All countries
in future waves of SAGE will use CAPI, which will
improve efficiency in terms of sample and data
management. Information from earlier waves will be
preloaded in the CAPI for respondents who are being
followed up and consistency checks will be carried out
in future rounds.
Data resource access
The SAGE website (www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/
sage) and Wikipedia site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Study_on_Global_Ageing_and_Adult_Health) provide
additional details and access to survey materials. A
recent US Census Bureau report provides a cogent
summary of some of the measures included in
SAGE.19
SAGE is committed to the public release of study
instruments, protocols and meta- and micro-data for
Waves 0 and 1. Study documentation was based on
standards created by the Data Documentation
Initiative (www.ddialliance.org/) for data archiving.
Prospective users will be asked to complete a Users
Agreement before access is provided. Micro- and
meta-data are available through:

Funding
SAGE and SAGE sub-studies are supported by the
Division of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR)
at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), US
National Institutes of Health, through Interagency
Agreements (OGHA 04034785; YA1323-08-CN-0020;
Y1-AG-1005-01) with WHO and a Research Project
Grant 1 R01 AG034479-01A1. In addition, the govern-
ments of China and South Africa have provided
financial or other support for their national studies.
USAID provided additional funds in support of SAGE
India to increase the sample of women aged 15­49 as
a nested study examining health in younger women,
which used the Wave 0 questions about maternal and
child health in the Wave 1 interview for these
women. SAGE Waves 2 and 3 are funded through
committed support from the NIA and WHO. All col-
laborating institutions provided substantial resources
to conduct the studies.
The US NIA BSR provided funding for the four
African INDEPTH field sites and two Asian field
sites (Matlab and Vadu), through an Interagency
Agreement (OGHA 04034785) with WHO. The
Purworejo and Fila Bavi field sites were supported
by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social
Research, Grant No. 2006-1512. The Umea Centre for
Global Health Research (supported by FAS, the
Swedish Council for Working Life and Social
Research, Grant No. 2006-1512) provided technical
support and advice to the INDEPTH field sites.
The US NIA BSR provided funding for SAGE-
Well-Being in Older Persons Study (WOPS, HIV
study) through an Interagency Agreement with WHO.

KEY MESSAGES
 SAGE provides health and well-being data on over 34 000 older adults in China, Ghana, India,
Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa, suggesting significant differences in the rates of
health decline between the countries.
 SAGE provides health, disability, chronic conditions, risk factors and health care utilization data
needed to prepare for an ageing world in lower-income countries, with data comparable to studies
in higher-income countries, such as the Health and Retirement Study family of studies.
 The SAGE-INDEPTH collaboration generates two waves of health, disability and well-being data in
eight health and demographic surveillance system field sites in four African and four Asian countries.
 A SAGE-HIV sub-study on the impacts of HIV, anti-retroviral therapy and caregiving in older adults
generates two waves of data in Uganda and South Africa.
