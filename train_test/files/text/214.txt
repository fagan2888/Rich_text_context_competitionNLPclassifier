OBJECTIVE -- Although clinically evident type 2 diabetes is a well-established cause of
mortality, less is known about subclinical states of glucose intolerance.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Data from the Second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study, a prospective study of adults, were analyzed.
This analysis focused on a nationally representative sample of 3,174 adults aged 30­75 years
who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at baseline (1976­1980) and who were followed
up for death through 1992.
RESULTS -- Using 1985 World Health Organization criteria, adults were classified as having
previously diagnosed diabetes (n  248), undiagnosed diabetes (n  183), impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT) (n  480), or normal glucose tolerance (n  2,263). For these groups, cumu-
lative all-cause mortality through age 70 was 41, 34, 27, and 20%, respectively (P  0.001).
Compared with those with normal glucose tolerance, the multivariate adjusted RR of all-cause
mortality was greatest for adults with diagnosed diabetes (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.56­2.84), followed
by those with undiagnosed diabetes (1.77, 1.13­2.75) and those with IGT (1.42, 1.08­1.87; P 
0.001). A similar pattern of risk was observed for cardiovascular disease mortality.
CONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S., there was a gradient of mortality associated with abnormal
glucose tolerance ranging from a 40% greater risk in adults with IGT to a 110% greater risk in
adults with clinically evident diabetes. These associations were independent of established
cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Diabetes Care 24:447­453, 2001
Diabetes is a well-established risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular disease mor-
tality, contributing to 700,000
deaths in the U.S. annually (1,2). How-
ever, less is known about the relationship
between mortality and subclinical states
of glucose intolerance, namely impaired
glucose tolerance (IGT) and undiagnosed
type 2 diabetes. Whereas previous studies
have generally indicated increased mor-
tality related to these states (3­14), they
have been limited by nonstandard meth-
ods of glucose tolerance assessment (4,6­
8), short follow-up (7,11), small numbers
of events (10,11), suboptimal classifica-
tion schemes (6,8,10,13), and samples
atypical of the general U.S. population
(3­14). Moreover, it remains unclear
whether this excess mortality is conferred
by glucose intolerance per se or rather by
other known cardiovascular disease risk
factors that commonly accompany diabe-
tes, i.e., high blood pressure, dyslipide-
mia, and obesity (15,16). Many previous
studies did not evaluate the relationship
between subclinical states of glucose
intolerance and death independent of
these potential confounding factors
(4,6,8,10,12). Establishing an indepen-
dent association of IGT and undiagnosed
diabetes with mortality in the general
population would support the idea that
improved screening programs and early
intervention may help reduce diabetes-
related mortality in the U.S.
Therefore, we conducted a prospec-
tive study with two objectives: 1) to com-
pare the mortality among individuals
with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, undiag-
nosed diabetes, and IGT with individuals
with normal glucose tolerance in the gen-
eral U.S. population; and 2) to determine
whether excess mortality in adults with
abnormal glucose tolerance was indepen-
dent of other established cardiovascular
disease risk factors.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data were from the
Second National Health and Nutrition
Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Study, a
prospective cohort study that passively
followed participants 30 years of age
who underwent a detailed examination in
the NHANES II (n  9,250). NHANES II
was conducted between 1976 and 1980
by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics. A stratified multistage sample design
was used to produce a representative sam-
ple of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civil-
ian population between the ages of 6
months and 74 years (17). The survey in-
cluded a physical examination, laboratory
tests, and questionnaires on health- and
nutrition-related topics. The response
rate for adults aged 20­74 years selected
for the examination was 68% (18).
Participants
Among individuals aged 30­74 years,
4,664 were selected at random and asked
to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test.
Individuals were excluded from analysis
if they attended the afternoon examina-
tion session (n  14), had a 2-h oral glu-
cose tolerance test duration 105 min or

135 min (n  2), had a missing 2-h
blood glucose value (n  1,402), or re-
ported race as "other" (i.e., neither Cau-
casian nor African-American) (n  62).
Participants who had type 1 diabetes, de-
fined by age of diagnosis 30 years and
current insulin use (n  10), were also
excluded from the analysis. Thus, the fi-
nal sample for this analysis included
3,174 Caucasian or African-American
adults whose glucose tolerance status was
known. However, participants with miss-
ing values for blood pressure, HDL, edu-
cation, smoking, or physical activity were
excluded from the multivariate analysis
(n  306).
Baseline assessments
Participants' age, sex, race, years of edu-
cation (less than high school and high
school or greater), and personal health
characteristics were obtained by inter-
view. Smoking status was categorized as
current, past, or never. Participants were
asked to rate both their recreational and
nonrecreational physical activity as "much,"
"moderate," or "little to no activity." Re-
sponses for both types of physical activity
questions were summed and recorded
according to the following classification:
1 (high in either recreational or nonrec-
reational and moderate in the other), 2
(moderate in both), 3 (moderate in one
and low in the other), and 4 (low activity
in both recreational and nonrecreational
activity).
Physical examination included mea-
suring height, weight, and blood pres-
sure. BMI was calculated as kilograms per
square meter for each participant (17). A
physician recorded each participant's
blood pressure twice in the sitting posi-
tion. The average of the two blood pres-
sure readings for each participant was
used in this study. Laboratory measures
including standard blood assays for total
serum cholesterol, HDLs, triglycerides,
creatinine, and plasma glucose levels
were obtained after participants fasted
overnight for 10­16 h (17). After a fasting
blood sample was taken, participants in-
gested 75 g glucose (17). Subsequent
blood samples were taken at 120  15
min postchallenge.
Definitions
Glucose tolerance was classified accord-
ing to 1985 World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria (17). Participants were
classified as having previously diagnosed
diabetes if they answered "yes" to both of
the following questions: "Do you have
glucose diabetes?" and "Did a doctor tell
you that you had it?" (n  248). Partici-
pants were classified as having undiag-
nosed diabetes if fasting plasma glucose
was 140 mg/dl or if 2-h plasma glucose
was 200 mg/dl (n  183) and classified
as having IGT if fasting plasma glucose
was 140 mg/dl (n  480) and 2-h
plasma glucose was between 140 and 199
mg/dl. All other participants were classi-
fied as having normal glucose tolerance
(n  2,263).
Participants were defined as having
cardiovascular disease at baseline if they
tested positive on a modified Rose angina
questionnaire (17) or answered "yes" to
any of the following questions from the
medical history questionnaire: "Has a
doctor ever told you that you had a heart
attack?" or "Have you ever had a stroke?
And did a doctor tell you this?" (17).
Outcomes
Mortality status was ascertained for the
years 1976­1992 by searching the Na-
tional Death Index and the Social Security
Administration Death Master File (19).
There was no censoring in this cohort;
participants not found to be deceased by
31 December 1992 were assumed to be
alive. Deaths were ascribed to cardiovas-
cular disease if any of the following con-
ditions were coded as underlying causes
of death according to the ninth revision
of the International Classification of Dis-
eases: hypertensive heart disease (402.0­
402.9), ischemic heart disease (410.0­
414.9), cardiac arrest (427.5), unspecified
heart failure (428.9), unspecified cardio-
vascular disease (429.2), cerebrovascular
disease (430.0­438.9), and diseases of
the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries
(440.0­444.9).
Analysis
All analyses were weighted to the U.S.
population at the midpoint of NHANES II
(1 March 1978) using SUDAAN statistical
software, version 6.4 (Research Triangle
Park, NC), to account for the complex
survey design and to provide nationally
representative estimates (18,20).
Demographic characteristics and car-
diovascular disease risk factors at baseline
were compared for participants with di-
agnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,
IGT, and normal glucose tolerance using
analysis of variance or Pearson's 2 test.
All tests of significance were two-tailed.
No corrections were made for multiple
comparisons.
Person-years analysis. The weighted
number of person-years was summed
separately for each glucose tolerance
group. The weighted numbers of deaths
due to all causes and to cardiovascular
diseases were also summed for each
group. Mortality was calculated for each
group using these weighted sums. The
Poisson distribution was used to calculate
95% CIs.
Life-table analysis. Cumulative mortal-
ity was determined using a life-table
method. For each 5-year age-group, the
weighted population, based on age at
death or at the end of follow-up, was cal-
culated along with the weighted number
of deaths from all-cause mortality and
cardiovascular disease mortality for each
glucose tolerance group. A life table was
developed, and the probability of mortal-
ity based on age was then calculated. Cu-
mulative mortality was determined for
all-cause and cardiovascular disease mor-
tality and plotted as cumulative mortality
curves by glucose tolerance group. Cu-
mulative mortality curves were compared
overall and by 5-year age intervals using
log-rank tests.
Proportional hazards analysis. To de-
termine whether differences in relative
hazard between glucose tolerance groups
could be explained by other variables,
proportional hazard models were con-
structed including age, sex and race, ed-
ucation, behavioral risk factors (physical
activity and smoking), and biological risk
factors (BMI, systolic blood pressure, and
HDL cholesterol). When participants
with baseline cardiovascular disease were
excluded from the analysis, there was no
change in the direction or magnitude of
the results. Therefore, the analysis in-
cludes participants with baseline cardio-
vascular disease. There were no signifi-
cant first-order interactions between the
glucose tolerance state and any covariate
(P  0.05). Graphs of the log-log plot of
the relative hazards by time showed that
the assumption of proportional hazards
was met. To test for trend, glucose toler-
ance was treated as a single ordinal vari-
able. Furthermore, because of potentially
differing effects of glucose tolerance by
age, all-cause mortality analyses were re-
peated after stratification at age 60 years.
This cut point was selected due to the
Subclinical glucose intolerance

oversampling of adults 60 years of age
in the NHANES II. Age-stratified models
were adjusted for all of the same risk fac-
tors as the unstratified models, including
continuous age. Because of the small
number of cardiovascular deaths in adults
60 years of age, stratified analyses were
not performed for cardiovascular out-
comes.
Analysis was repeated using the 1998
WHO criteria (21). Based on this criteria,
participants were classified as having
diagnosed diabetes (n  248); undiag-
nosed diabetes if fasting plasma glucose
was 126 mg/dl or if 2-h plasma glucose
was 200 mg/dl (n  206); IGT if fasting
plasma glucose was 126 mg/dl and 2-h
plasma glucose was 200 mg/dl (n 
464); or impaired fasting glucose if fasting
glucose was 110 and 126 mg/dl and
2-h glucose was 140 mg/dl (n  71).
Because of the small number of partici-
pants with impaired fasting glucose and
the small number of deaths in the group,
we combined the impaired fasting glu-
cose and the IGT groups into an abnormal
glucose tolerance group. All other partic-
ipants were classified as having normal
glucose tolerance (n  2,185).
RESULTS
Characteristics and risk factors at
baseline
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of
the cohort by glucose tolerance group at
baseline. The expected trends were ob-
served across the groups from normal glu-
cose tolerance to diagnosed diabetes.
Specifically, compared with their coun-
terparts with normal glucose tolerance,
individuals with abnormal glucose toler-
ance were older and more likely to be fe-
male, less educated, and sedentary. They
also had a greater adiposity, a lower HDL,
a higher blood pressure and triglyceride
level, and a stronger history of cardiovas-
cular disease.
Death rates
There were 737 deaths (23%) during
42,130 person-years of follow-up. The
all-cause death rate per 1,000 person-
years was highest for the diagnosed dia-
betes group (40.9%), followed by the
undiagnosed diabetes group (33.2%), the
IGT group (20.8%), and the normal glu-
cose tolerance group (10.6%) (P  0.001)
(Table 2). A similar gradient of death rates
was observed for cardiovascular disease
death.
Cumulative mortality
Likewise, the cumulative all-cause mor-
tality was strongly associated with the glu-
cose tolerance group (Fig. 1A). The
cumulative all-cause mortality at age 70
years was higher in those with diagnosed
diabetes (41.2%), undiagnosed diabetes
(33.9%), and IGT (26.7%) compared
with those with normal glucose tolerance
(20.3%) (overall log-rank P  0.001).
Again, a similar gradient of cumulative
cardiovascular disease mortality was ob-
served across glucose tolerance groups
(Fig. 1B).
Adjusted RRs
We constructed proportional hazards
models to determine whether the excess
risk of mortality associated with abnormal
glucose tolerance might be explained by
the presence of established cardiovascular
risk factors that commonly accompany
diabetes. After simultaneous adjustment
for age, sex, race, education, smoking, phy-
sical activity, BMI, systolic blood pres-
sure, and HDL cholesterol, abnormal

glucose tolerance remained strongly as-
sociated with all-cause mortality. Com-
pared with their counterparts with nor-
mal glucose tolerance, RR of mortality
was 1.42 times greater in those with IGT,
1.77 times greater in those with undiag-
nosed diabetes, and 2.11 times greater in
those with diagnosed diabetes (Table 2).
A similar gradient in adjusted risk was ob-
served for cardiovascular disease mortal-
ity, although the individual RRs for those
with IGT and undiagnosed diabetes were
not statistically different from those with
normal glucose tolerance (Table 2).
We repeated the analysis using the
1998 WHO criteria for undiagnosed dia-
betes and abnormal glucose tolerance.
Similar trends were observed for both all-
cause mortality and cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality. The RR of death from all
cause, compared with participants with
normal glucose tolerance, increased from
1.45 for abnormal glucose tolerance (95%
CI 1.14­1.86) to 1.64 for undiagnosed
diabetes (1.10­2.45) and to 2.42 for di-
agnosed diabetes (1.74­3.37) (P  0.05).
A similar trend was seen with the RR of
death from all cause, compared with par-
ticipants with normal glucose tolerance
for cardiovascular disease mortality. For
abnormal glucose tolerance, the RR was
1.19 (0.89­1.58), and for undiagnosed
diabetes, the RRs were 1.39 (0.76­2.55)
and 2.91 (1.94­4.35), respectively, com-
pared with participants with normal glu-
cose tolerance (P  0.05).
We conducted subsidiary analyses af-
ter stratification by age in light of the
known relationship of abnormal glucose
tolerance with age. These stratified analy-
ses revealed an attenuated pattern of risk
in individuals 60 vs. 60 years of age.
Specifically, the RR of all-cause mortality
compared with participants with normal
glucose tolerance were as follows: IGT
1.68 (95% CI 0.90­3.15) for participants
60 years vs. 1.10 (0.85­2.73) for par-
ticipants 60 years; undiagnosed diabe-
tes 2.35 (1.02­5.49) for participants 60
years vs. 1.35 (0.83­2.20) for partici-
pants 60 years; and diagnosed diabetes
2.38 (0.95­6.00) for participants 60
years vs. 2.00 (1.46­2.73) for partici-
pants 60 years. However, this apparent
attenuation of age with glucose tolerance
was not statistically significant (P 
0.24).
CONCLUSIONS -- These data sug-
gest that in the U.S., subclinical states of
glucose intolerance are associated with a
42­77% greater risk for all-cause mortal-
ity and a 15­54% greater risk for cardio-
vascular disease mortality. These asso-
ciations are independent of established
cardiovascular disease risk factors that
commonly accompany abnormal glucose
tolerance. Strengths of this study include
a large nationally representative sample,
12­16 years of follow-up, use of standard
definitions of glucose tolerance, and a
specific focus on the subclinical states of
glucose intolerance that would be the ob-
ject of screening programs.
Nonetheless, there were three limita-
tions of this study. First, there was nonre-
sponse in NHANES II at each stage of the
survey. In particular, for adults aged
20­74 years, only 68.0% of the partici-
pants selected for the survey in the oral
glucose tolerance test subsample com-
pleted the examination (18). Previous
analysis showed that respondents and
nonrespondents did not differ signifi-
cantly in demographic or health-related
characteristics (18,22). The respondents
and nonrespondents also did not differ by
mortality experience: all-cause mortality
per 1,000 person-years was 17.3 (95% CI
16.1­18.7) for respondents and 18.0 for
nonrespondents (16.1­20.2). Second,
because mortality follow-up was passive,
misclassification of vital status was possi-
ble. Previous studies indicate that deaths
may be underascertained in African-
Americans (19). In as far as African-Amer-
icans were overrepresented in the abnor-
mal glucose tolerance groups, this may
have produced an underestimate of the
mortality risk. Finally, glucose tolerance
status was only assessed at baseline, and it
is likely that many participants in the IGT
group developed diabetes. Recent evi-
dence from several U.S. cohort studies
suggests a conversion rate from IGT to
diabetes ranging from 3.5 per 100 per-
son-years to 5.7 per 100 person-years
(23). However, only 6.7% of the IGT

group who died had diabetes coded on
death certificates. This cannot fully ex-
plain the increased risk of mortality.
Since 1990, at least 12 epidemiologi-
cal studies have related glucose tolerance
to mortality (3­14); of these studies, 9
had follow-up periods 5 years (3­
11,14). All nine studies showed increased
risk of death among individuals with ab-
normal glucose tolerance, but all had im-
portant limitations. Three studies were
limited to employed, primarily Cauca-
sian, men (4,7,10). Four studies used
nonstandard glucose tolerance tests (4,6­
8), the results of which cannot be directly
compared with WHO standards. Al-
though the Seven Counties Finnish Study
and the Paris Prospective Study used a
75-g standard, neither evaluated individ-
uals with undiagnosed diabetes sepa-
rately; instead, individuals were pooled
into a single diabetes category to compen-
sate for small numbers of incident cases
(4,10). Finally, only three studies re-
ported 10 years of follow-up (4,8).
However, all 12 studies did show a con-
sistent gradient of mortality across cate-
gories of worsening glucose intolerance.
Recent studies have also shown an in-
creased risk of death by elevated 2-h glu-
cose levels compared with elevated
fasting glucose levels (3,9,11,14). A pre-
vious study using nationally representa-
tive data from the U.S. found an increased
risk of mortality for adults with type 2
diabetes, but lacked information on sub-
clinical states (24).
Our results suggest that IGT and un-
diagnosed diabetes are independent pre-

dictors of all-cause and cardiovascular
disease mortality. There are several possi-
ble explanations for this finding (25,26).
First, the subclinical states may be mark-
ers for greater or more prolonged expo-
sure to established cardiovascular disease
risk factors (such as high blood pressure),
beyond what is captured by measure-
ments of these risk factors at a single point
in time, as in this study. Second, the sub-
clinical states may be mainly important
insofar as they predict the development of
clinically evident (i.e., more severe) dia-
betes. Finally, hyperglycemia or hyperin-
sulinemia may directly confer risk.
Elucidation of the exact causal pathway
may lead to improvements in treatment.
Nonetheless, even without such informa-
tion on mechanism, subclinical states ap-
pear to convey important prognostic
information that would otherwise be
overlooked during routine clinical assess-
ment of adiposity, blood pressure, and
lipids.
Thus, subclinical states of glucose in-
tolerance may represent logical targets for
mass screening programs aimed at reduc-
ing diabetes-related mortality in the U.S.
However, identification of prognostically
valuable subclinical states alone is not suf-
ficient justification for mass screening.
One must also demonstrate that treat-
ments applied at the subclinical stage are
more effective (and perhaps more cost-
effective) than treatments applied after di-
abetes clinically manifests (27,28).
Unfortunately, data on the treatment of
subclinical states of glucose intolerance
are sparse. The U.K. Prospective Diabetes
Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that more
aggressive glycemic control of adults with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes pro-
duced reductions in microvascular com-
plications, but these individuals had
clinically manifested diabetes. In other
words, UKPDS recruitment relied on
physician referral of patients, not screen-
ing of asymptotic individuals (29). With
regard to IGT, one small treatment trial
has been completed (30), and several
larger trials are currently being under-
taken, including the Diabetes Prevention
Program (31), but these trials are not
powered to study the effects of early in-
tervention on diabetic complications or
death. Nonetheless, the main implication
of our study is that improvement in the
detection and treatment of undiagnosed
diabetes and IGT should reduce mortality
in the general U.S. population. The deter-
mination of effective treatments depends
on the results of ongoing trials and ad-
vances in our understanding of the patho-
genesis of cardiovascular disease and
other diabetes-related complications that
lead to premature death.
