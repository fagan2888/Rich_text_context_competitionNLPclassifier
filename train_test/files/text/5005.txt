Women represent more than one quarter of all new HIV diag-
noses in the United States, and unprotected sexual inter-
course is the primary exposure to HIV for females ages 13 to
24 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],
2008, 2013b). National data consistently report gender and
race as determinates of higher incidence rates, morbidity, and
mortality associated with HIV and AIDS (CDC, 2013a).
Black women are disproportionately affected by HIV,
accounting for the majority of new HIV infections among
women (CDC, 2013b). In addition, Black women ages 18 to
24 years have higher rates of unintended pregnancies and are
almost 5 times more likely to have had an abortion, than
White women (Finer & Henshaw, 2006; James et al., 2009).
Risk factors that promote HIV acquisition among Black
college students range from little or no condom-use (Adefuye,
Abiona, Balogun, & Lukobo-Durrell, 2009; Jemmott, 1991;
Sutton, 2011) to gender-ratio imbalance (larger proportion
women enrolled compared with males; Sutton, 2011). The
gender-ratio imbalance is also reflected in the African
American community, contributing to Black women being
more tolerant of partner promiscuity and concurrent relation-
ships (Waldrop-Valverde et al., 2013). Black women, who
constitute the population with the highest rate of new HIV
infections, are likely to be infected while attending college
(CDC, 1995; Gayle et al., 1990). A study by Hou (2009) sug-
gests the need for interventions targeted toward Black female
college students, reporting that Black students were more
likely than those from traditional White institutions (TWI) to
have had vaginal sex at a younger age, to have a sexually
transmitted infection (STI), or to have been pregnant.Among
adolescents and young adults, media has increasingly
become a point of reference for sexual identity and behavior
(J. D. Brown et al., 2006; Council on Communications and
Media, 2010; Strasburger & Council on Communications
and Media American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). Other
studies have concluded that media influences have been sig-
nificantly associated with sexual intentions and behaviors
(Bleakley, Hennessy, & Fishbein, 2011; J. D. W. Brown &
Elizabeth, 2002; J. D. Brown, Halpern, & L'Engle, 2005).
However, contrasting studies report that exposure to sexual
content in the media does not accelerate initiation of sexual
intercourse (Steinberg & Monahan, 2011). Our study
explored the media sources used for information about
sexual health as a foundation for learning how media might
be used to facilitate interpersonal communication.

Abstract
Young women are increasingly diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. The aim of this study was
to test various types of mass media and their associations with interpersonal communication about sex and HIV or AIDS
among female college students, stratified by race. The study used a nonexperimental cross-sectional design and an electronic
survey. The sample consisted of female college students (N = 776) at a 4-year public university in the southeast. We found
that the race of college women influenced their preferred media source for reception of information about sex and HIV/
AIDS, which subsequently either motivated or was insignificant to communication with parents and/or partners.

Media, Interpersonal Communication,
and the Female College Student
Mass media messages can be an effective tool for providing
accurate, culturally, and age-appropriate HIV/STI preven-
tion information (Romer et al., 2009; Sznitman, Vanable,
et al., 2011). In a recent report by the National Campaign
to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, Black youth
(n = 1,500) ages 13 to 21 reported that they often feel invis-
ible in the media that they consume, and when they see
themselves, the images seen are insulting ("under Pressure:
What African-American Teens Aren't Telling You About
Sex, Love, and Relationships" 2012). More specifically,
Black youth reported feeling pressured to have sex from
society (51%), the media (48%), and partners (36%).
Regarding media, Black youth felt they were portrayed as
less intelligent, more prone to failure, and less successful in
relationships. On television, Black males are portrayed as
nonchalant about sex, and females depend on sex appeal
rather than intelligence for their livelihood ("Under Pressure:
What African-American Teens Aren't Telling You About
Sex, Love, and Relationships" 2012).
The environmental influence of mass media on interper-
sonal relationships in college students is a viable area of
research (see Table 1), particularly because most HIV pre-
vention messages targeting this age group are through mass
media campaigns. Message delivery and cultural background
of the target audience are essential for tailoring mass media
interventions. Like marketers, analyzing audiences and stra-
tegically promoting product/content to targeted populations
can be a tool to create and translate HIV/STI prevention
campaigns to college women. In the past, there have been
mass media HIV prevention messages; however, there are no
evaluative tools that determine the impact of these messages.
Moreover, there have been few reports of campaign mes-
sages'ability to mediate relationships and help facilitate pro-
tective communication with parents and/or partners (DuRant,
Wolfson, LaFrance, Balkrishnan, & Altman, 2006; Helme
et al., 2011). In addition, understanding gender and racial dif-
ferences of message receptivity will allow for appropriate
customization of HIV prevention messages that promote
interpersonal communication.
Empirically based media prevention interventions using
efficacious communication techniques may have the greatest

Jones & Lacroix, 2012; Major & Coleman, 2012; Medina &
Rios, 2011; Romer et al., 2009; Sznitman, Stanton, et al.,
2011; Sznitman, Vanable, et al., 2011). Younger-aged
women are influenced significantly by mass media (J. D.
Brown et al., 2005); yet there are few research studies
reported on the association of communication systems and
interpersonal relationships in college females. Determining
mass media influences that might facilitate interpersonal
communication and ultimately affect sexual decision mak-
ing may assist scientists in developing appropriate interven-
tions that appeal to a population of female college students.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the associa-
tions between race, preferred HIV mass media message
mediums, and interpersonal relationships among female
college students. Mass media is limited to print media,
television (TV), Internet, and radio. This study addressed
the following research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the relationships between
selected demographic characteristics and extent of com-
munication with parents, partners, and peers?
Research Question 2: Based on race, to what extent does
the amount and type of media exposure affect parent and
partner communication?
Study design and research methods have been previously
described (Chandler, et al, in press). However, we summa-
rize the study methodology. In brief, a nonexperimental
cross-sectional design was used. Data were collected via an
Internet-based survey using the Dillman (2006) Tailored
Design Method.
Sample
A convenience sample (n = 766) of female college students
ages 18 to 21 years attending a 4-year public university in the
southeast was recruited.
Several instruments were combined and placed into an
electronic format to test associations between variables. The
surveys used included: a demographic questionnaire, the
AIDS Risk Knowledge Test, The Parent and Peer Influence
Scale, the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale,
the Partner Communication Scale (PCS), and the Sex and
AIDS Communication Measure. A detailed description of
each survey has been published (Chandler, et al, in press).
Data Collection Methods
After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval
from the source institution, an encrypted username/password
protected online survey program, Ultimate Survey soft-
ware®, was used for constructing and revising the survey.
This program is designed to distribute electronic recruitment
messages with survey links, via email, to a large volume of
recipients. Email addresses of the target population were
obtained from the registrar's office. Using the Tailored
Design Method to ensure maximal response rate (Dillman,
2006), age-eligible female college students could receive a
maximum of four email contacts. The second contact was
7 days after the first, and the third and fourth contacts fol-
lowed in 7-day increments.
Data Analyses
The survey data were exported, in bulk, from the Ultimate
Survey® program and analyzed using the StatisticalAnalysis
System (SAS). The data system was password protected on a
dedicated computer, to ensure confidentiality with data entry,
management, and analysis.
Statistical Methods
Analyses were conducted by race, with demographic charac-
teristics compared by use of student t tests for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Similarly, student t tests were used to compare parent com-
munication, partner communication, peer influence, HIV
knowledge, and perceived risk for HIV/AIDS scores by race.
Spearman (ranked) correlation coefficients were computed
to estimate the strength of relationship between various types
of media exposure and media content and parent and partner
communication scores. Analyses were stratified by race.
General linear models with interaction terms (race × media
exposure/content variable) were fit to test for evidence of
heterogeneity by race in the relationships between media
exposure/content variables and parent and partner communi-
cation scores. A two-sided p value less than .05 was used to
define statistical significance.
Results
The mean age of the study population was 20 years and did
not differ by race; however, Blacks were more likely than
Whites to be in their freshman year at the time of survey
participation (Table 2). Having a mother who was married
was more common in White (74.1%) compared with Black
students (50.0%), and fathers of White students were more
likely to be college educated.
Communication, Influence, and Knowledge Scores
Compared with White students, Black students had higher
mean communication scores with their partners (7.6 vs. 5.9,
p = .002) and a trend toward higher mean communication
scores with their parents (4.0 vs. 3.1, p = .07; Table 3). In
contrast, White students reported being influenced more by
peers than Black students. The mean HIV knowledge score
and perceived risk for HIV/AIDS did not differ statistically
by race.

Media Exposure and Communication
In examining extent of communication with parents, the
strongest correlation among White students was for those
who reported higher number of hours per week being exposed
to magazines (R
S
= .15, p = .0003; Table 4a). A similar result
was also observed for Black students (R
S
= .17). Yet Black
students who reported higher levels of exposure to Black
Entertainment Television (BET; R
S
= .18, p = .07) and radio
(R
S
= .24, p = .02) also reported more communication with
their parents. There was evidence of statistical interaction
(p = .0003) whereby Blacks exposed to more hours of radio
per week reported more communication with their parents,
an association that was not observed in White students.
In examining extent of communication with partners,
hours of Internet exposure per day was positively associated
with communication among White students (R
S
= .14,
p = .003; Table 4b). A reverse result was indicated in Black
students (R
S
= -.14, p = .25), which yielded a statistically
significant interaction effect (p = .02). The other contrary
finding with respect to communication with one's partner
was a positive correlation for hours of reading per day among
Whites (R
S
= .11, p = .02) and a negative correlation among
Blacks (R
S
= -.15, p = .22; for interaction p = .009).
Media Content Exposure and Communication
In evaluating exposure to information on sexual behavior
and risk of HIV/AIDS, relationships with parent communi-
cation were consistently positive yet small among White stu-
dents (R
S
range = .11-.20; Table 4a). Notwithstanding
statistical power (i.e., Blacks having a much smaller sample
size than Whites and lower statistical power), the relation-
ships between exposure to information on sexual behavior
and risk of HIV/AIDS with parent communication were con-
sistently positive and somewhat stronger among Black stu-
dents (R
S
range = .16-.33).
Adifferent pattern of association was observed for partner
communication (Table 4b). Specifically, exposure to infor-
mation on sexual behavior and risk of HIV/AIDS was con-
sistently positively associated with partner communication
scores among White students (R
S
range = .14-.40). In con-
trast, there was essentially no association among Black

risk of HIV/AIDS and extent of partner communication.
Differential Association of Radio Exposure
As depicted in Figure 1, the impact of radio exposure on
extent of parent and partner communication appeared to dif-
fer markedly by race. Specifically, Black students had higher
levels of communication with their parents than White stu-
dents when receiving more radio exposure, particularly,
sheer number of hours per week and items about IV drug use
and condoms. In contrast, White students had higher levels
of communication with their partners than Black students
when receiving more radio information about HIV/AIDS
and IV drug use (Table 5).
Discussion
Our study indicates that race is related to preferred media
sources for information about sex and HIV/AIDS and sug-
gests that exposure motivates communication with parents,
partners, and/or peers. The Kaiser Family Foundation's 2011
survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS reports that media is the
public's top source of information about HIV (KFF, 2011).
According to this report, "six in ten Americans say most of
what they know about HIV/AIDS comes from the media,
putting it ahead of other sources like school, doctors, friends
and family." Similarly, "media is the top information source
for younger and older adults alike" (KFF, 2011). Considering
that media is a formidable resource for information about
sexual health and HIV, the results of our study support the
notion that message delivery is relevant to interpersonal dia-
logue about sex and sexual risk.
Media Exposure and Communication
Black women reported higher parental and partner commu-
nication scores when compared with White women; yet,
higher rates of STI and HIV/AIDS continue to dispropor-
tionally affect Black women (CDC, 2013a; 2013b). For
Black women, more hours of radio exposure and BET had a
significant relationship with communication with parents.
We infer that the exchanges on sexual behavior and risk of
HIV/AIDS does not appear to be protective against unde-
sired health outcomes; hence, a need to facilitate more effec-
tive dialogue arises.

In recent focus groups conducted by the first author, Black
college women expressed that parents were extremely vague
when discussing sex, even describing their parents as uncom-
fortable or fearful of the topic. Yet, many of these Black col-
lege women still regarded their parents, especially their
mothers, as the most desired source for information about
intimacy. When parents are hesitant to discuss sex and sexual
risks, perhaps such hesitancy is internalized by their children
and thus avoidance of discussing this subject matter is nor-
malized. Avoiding interpersonal conversations about sex cul-
tivates interest in songs heard on the radio and videos seen on
television as alternative sources for sex education (J. D.
Brown & Keller, 2000). Lyrics are personal expressions from
musicians and videos portray a fantastical view, but don't
typically provide a factual depiction of sex or reveal the
potential risks. Although hearing and viewing sex laden con-
tent stimulates curiosity and prompts conversation with par-
ents and partners, it is unknown the extent to which women
are getting accurate or enough information. In contrast, White
women's exposure to magazines influenced their communi-
cation with parents. Although specific magazines were not
explored, magazines are much more scrutinized with regard
to information reliability. Thus, by inference, White women
who read content in magazines may be more likely to get a
detailed and accurate explanation about sex, and simply may
need to confirm what was read with their parents.
Media Content Exposure and Communication
Unlike White students, there was no association among
Black students for exposure to information about sexual
behavior and risk of HIV/AIDS related to partner communi-
cation. Considering the differences between White and Black
college women's preferred media source, and who they feel
prompted to talk to about sex when exposed to media about
intimacy, a detailed assessment of radio and television (e.g.,
BET) broadcasting statistics and magazine readership might
reveal specific content to which this population is most often
exposed. Furthermore, analyzing content from each media
domain might be useful to decipher race-related differences
and outline for organizations and/or researchers culturally-
specific media to promote safe sex and HIV prevention. Our
study implies that messages targeting Black women may not
be emphasizing the importance of talking with their partners,
and learning how to effectively communicate with their part-
ners is essential to safe sex practices, including but not lim-
ited to condom negotiation.
The limitations of this study have been published
(Chandler et al, in press ).
Conclusion
Because there was no appreciable difference among Blacks
and Whites in this study with respect to overall knowledge of
HIV/AIDS, we wonder if there remains a deficit with trans-
lating information into action. This includes whether these
women are being equipped with the skills to apply the infor-
mation they do know about HIV/AIDS to their relationships
with sexual partners. As one approach, we recommend short
and informative media (Helme et al., 2011) with a technique
that we coined Sex Safety Speed tactics (S3T). Sample topics
include (a) strategies on how to know your partner when sex-
ting, (b) romantic cues and content that reveal important
information before foreplay, (c) making condom-use your
decision but keep it sexy, (d) decode your conversation about
sex with parents.
Chandler et al. 7
Like other studies, perceived health risk tends to be low
and knowledge about HIV/AIDS high in adolescent and
young adult populations regardless of race (Lim, Hellard,
Aitken, & Hocking, 2007). Thus, in aggregate, college
women, regardless of race, generally have some basic knowl-
edge about HIV transmission. However, these women may
struggle trying to translate such knowledge into safe sex
practices. We recommend that future mass media HIV pre-
vention campaigns integrate messages that help college
women build skills that will facilitate effective interpersonal
communication. In this realm, messages should be custom-
ized to be culturally specific and age appropriate.
