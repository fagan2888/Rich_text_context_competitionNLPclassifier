Numerous studies uncover a link between cognitive skills and adolescent
violence. Overlooked is whether the relationship changes at varying levels of
neighborhood disadvantage. We examine the issue by contrasting two models
that place individual difference in cognitive skill within a social-structural
framework. Using five waves of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
and a three-level hierarchical model, results indicate that cognitive skill is
inversely associated with violence and that the relationship is strongest in non-
disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the cognitive skills­violence relation-
ship is indistinguishable from zero in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
The findings are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that social expression
of developed ability is muted in disadvantaged contexts.

A relationship between cognitive skills1 and delinquency is well documented in
criminological research. Hirschi and Hindelang's (1977) review of research
Paul E. Bellair is an Associate Professor of Sociology at The Ohio State University. His current
research examines the relationship between employment opportunity and parolee recidivism, reli-
ability, and validity of prisoner self reports, measurement of and relationship between community
organization and crime, and neighborhood effects on anti-social behavior across the life course.
Thomas L. McNulty is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Georgia. His most
recent work tests multilevel models of racial and ethnic differences in violence, with emphasis on
the role of family, school, and community context. He is currently co-principal investigator on a
four-year grant examining the socio-cultural and community risk factors for violence among African
American adolescents and young adults. Correspondence to: Paul Bellair, Department of Sociology,

1. Throughout the paper, we use the term "cognitive skills" as opposed to intelligence or IQ because
the latter connotes a more genetic interpretation than we think is warranted. In our view, intelli-
gence or standardized tests, including the composite math and reading score analyzed below, reflect
both academic skills/achievement and innate ability. This is consistent with Jencks and Phillips
(1998) interpretation of test scores as indicating "developed abilities" rather than innate abilities.
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 539
conducted between 1950 and the early 1970s (e.g., Reiss & Rhodes, 1961; Short
& Strodtbeck, 1965; West, 1973; Wolfgang, Figlio, & Sellin, 1972) led them to
conclude that the relationship is as substantively important as the associations
between delinquency, social class, and race. Numerous studies since confirm
that cognitive skills and delinquency are intertwined (Denno, 1989; Gordon,
1987; Lynam, Moffitt, & Southamer-Loeber, 1993; Moffitt, 1990; Wilson &
Herrnstein, 1985), although the mechanism by which it influences delinquency
and its effect size relative to "social" risk factors remain matters of debate
(Fischer et al., 1996).
Research examining the cognitive skills and delinquency relation most
frequently emphasizes individual rather than structural processes. This is
perhaps most telling in works such as The Bell Curve, in which Herrnstein and
Murray (1994) argue that "genetic endowment" is the root cause of social
problems ranging from low earnings to criminal involvement (see also Wilson
& Herrnstein, 1985). They propose several intervening mechanisms by which
low intelligence quotient (IQ) may increase criminal involvement including
failure and lack of attachment to school, preference for risk, diminished
sensitivity to victim's pain, and inability to comprehend right from wrong.
That work led to important rebuttals from scholars that emphasize social-
structural approaches to group outcomes (e.g., Cullen, Gendreau, Jarjoura, &
Wright, 1997; Fischer et al., 1996; Lilly Cullen, & Ball, 2002; Wilson, 1996).
Structural theories stress variation in family structure and socioeconomic
status (SES), associations with delinquent peers, attachment to conventional
institutions, and neighborhood disadvantage--each of which may mediate or
moderate the relationship between cognitive skills and delinquency (see
McGloin, Pratt, & Maahs, 2004).
Despite increasing scholarly investigation of "neighborhood effects," the role
of neighborhood context is overlooked in most research examining the cognitive
skills­delinquency relationship (but see Bellair & McNulty, 2005; Sampson,
Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). In particular, we are not aware of any studies
that document how the relationship changes at varying levels of neighborhood
disadvantage. Yet, the issue has important implications. From an empirical
standpoint, models that do not consider neighborhood context may over- or
under-estimate the effect of cognitive skills depending on the distribution of
subjects across levels of disadvantage in a particular sample. The repercussion
for theory is continued reliance on unsophisticated or inaccurate interpretations
of the impact of cognitive skill.
There are differing mechanisms by which neighborhood context may pattern
the cognitive skills­delinquency relationship. Perhaps most well known is the
cumulative continuity thesis, which suggests that delinquency is most likely
when multiple risk factors converge and compound over time (see Moffitt, 1993;
Sampson & Laub, 1993). Those theories were not designed specifically to
address the issues pursued here, but the logic of cumulative disadvantage
suggests that the impact of low cognitive skill will likely be amplified for adoles-
cents residing in disadvantaged environments. The cumulative disadvantage
540 BELLAIR AND MCNULTY
hypothesis anticipates a negative interaction effect between cognitive skill and
neighborhood disadvantage.
Alternatively, literature on trait­environment interaction suggests that every
child has a genetic potential (innate mental ability) for cognitive development,
but the chances of realizing that potential are conditioned by features of the
environment (Guo & Stearns, 2002). Children growing up in disadvantaged envi-
ronments may encounter pervasive social constraints that hamper mobility
(Kotlowitz, 1991), and therefore may be less likely to realize their potential.
Evidence that poor learning environments suppress genetic potential for intel-
lectual development implies that cognitive skills, which are partially influenced
by genetic endowment, will be constrained in their social expression and less
likely to influence delinquency in disadvantaged contexts. The prediction is
consistent with Raine's (2000) "social push" hypothesis, and with some perspec-
tives on human development which also expect individual-difference variables
to differentially impact developmental outcomes at varying levels of neighbor-
hood disadvantage (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; Lewin, 1939; Lynam et al., 2000;
Magnusson, 1988). These perspectives imply a positive interaction effect
between cognitive skill and neighborhood disadvantage.
In the present study, we address these contrasting approaches to the condi-
tional effect of cognitive skills with a sample of adolescents drawn from the
first five waves of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97),
matched with block-group data from the 2000 US Census. The dependent vari-
able is the frequency of violent attacks,2 which is examined in a three-level
hierarchical model with repeated observations of violence involvement across
five waves (Level 1) nested within persons (Level 2) and neighborhoods (Level
3). Cognitive skill is measured using the reading and math percentile score
derived from administration of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
(ASVAB), a measure that is very similar to the Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT) measure available in other NLSY datasets and utilized extensively by
Herrnstein and Murray (1994).3 In contrast to the genetic interpretation,
however, we follow Jencks and Phillips (1998) "and almost all psychologists
[whom] now agree that intelligence tests measure developed rather than innate
abilities, and that people's developed abilities depend on their environment as
well as their genes" (p. 13). In the sections that follow, we more thoroughly
situate the analysis in the respective literatures.
2. Previous research often examines cognitive skills in relation to a general delinquency outcome
rather than a measure focused solely on violence, although some research focuses exclusively on
violence. Most studies that employ a delinquency outcome include violence items in the scale. We
focus on violence because it is widely considered to be more socially and economically problematic
(see Wolfgang, Figlio, Tracy, & Singer, 1985) than many of the less serious property or drug use items
that are often included in delinquency scales.

codebook supplement.
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 541
Cognitive Skills and Violence in Neighborhood Context
Disadvantage Intensifies the Effect of Cognitive Skill on Violence
Neighborhood effects literature indicates that cognitive skills including IQ,
academic achievement, and years of schooling are influenced by neighborhood
contexts (Brooks-Gunn, Duncun, & Aber, 1997), and that this influence persists
after controlling for individual-level SES (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).
Criminological literature indicates further that neighborhood disadvantage is
positively associated with individual-level delinquency and violence (see Elliot
et al., 1996; Gephart, 1997; Gottfredson, McNeil, & Gottfredson, 1991;
Peeples & Loeber, 1994; Simcha-Fagan & Schwartz, 1986; Wikstrom & Loeber,
2000). Yet, despite theoretical justification, it remains unclear whether the
cognitive skills­violence relationship varies as a function of neighborhood
context.
The cumulative disadvantage hypothesis can be traced at least to Merton's
(1973, p. 445) description of the "Mathew effect," which proposes that the
problems of disadvantaged individuals are likely to multiply while social
advantage flows towards the already advantaged (Hannon, 2003). The theme
is influential in the criminological literature, although adapted to address
varying issues. Moffitt's (1993) theory of life course persistent (LCP) offend-
ers, for instance posits that the affect of neuropsychological deficits such as
low IQ are compounded by negative interaction in social environments.
Children with cognitive deficits, for example, may evoke dysfunctional reac-
tions from parents, especially under conditions of family adversity, including
inconsistent discipline, frustration, and withdrawal in parent­child interac-
tions. Moffitt's focus is on inadequate family environments, but the logic can
be extended to neighborhoods. Sampson and Laub (1993) emphasize that
structural disadvantage and individual differences increase violence by weak-
ening parental and school social controls and by intensifying the impact of
labeling processes.
Support for the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis is evident in several
studies. Lynam et al. (2000) provide direct evidence in their analysis of the
Pittsburgh Youth Study. They examined the conditional effect of impulsivity
on delinquency across varying levels of neighborhood disadvantage and found
that impulsivity had its strongest effect on violence in the most disadvan-
taged contexts. Their interpretation draws from prior research on the rela-
tion between disadvantage and diminished collective efficacy (Sampson,
Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997). They theorized that "external controls ... may be
especially missed by youth who have fewer internal controls" (p. 571). Indi-
rect evidence is provided in adoption studies, which show that children at
risk for crime (by virtue of having criminal biological parents) are more likely
to commit crime if they are reared in a "criminogenic" environment
(Bohman, 1996; Cadoret, Yates, Troughton, Woodworth, & Stewart, 1995;
Mednick, Gabrielli, & Hutchings, 1984).
542 BELLAIR AND MCNULTY
Theoretically, neighborhood disadvantage is associated with reduced institu-
tional resources (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000, p. 322), such as the "availability,
accessibility, affordability, and quality of ... learning, recreational, and social
activities; child care; schools; medical facilities; and employment opportunities."
Particularly consequential are learning activities such as "libraries, family
resource centers, literacy programs, and museums," the absence of which "may
influence children's development, especially school readiness and achievement
outcomes" (p. 322). As a result of blighted institutional environments, adolescents
possessing diminished cognitive skills may become more frustrated in school and
hence develop weaker attachment and commitment (Hirschi, 1969) than might
be the case in a resource rich community. If the effect of low cognitive skill is
intensified in disadvantaged environments, then a negative interaction effect in
which cognitive skills are more strongly related to violent behavior in poor
neighborhoods is expected.
Disadvantage Weakens the Effect of Cognitive Skill on Violence
Alternative conceptions also suggest the relevance for violence of an interaction
between cognitive skill and neighborhood disadvantage although the nature of
the effect differs from the previous discussion. The behavioral genetics
approach (Guo & Stearns, 2002) argues that every child has a genetic potential
for intellectual development, but the extent to which that potential is realized
depends on nurturance in the social environment. A child growing up in a poor,
inner city area will therefore have more difficulty translating his or her cogni-
tive skill into social mobility than a child of equal potential in an affluent
context.
In a context of high disadvantage, the influence of predisposition and
achievement on violence is diminished because poor learning environments
suppress the potential for cognitive development, even among those with
heightened cognitive skill. In a poor learning environment, cognitive skill is
likely to be supplanted by the influence of the social environment. Some
research supports this hypothesis. Guo and Stearns (2002), using sibling and
twin data, find that parental unemployment and African American status asso-
ciate with a lower contribution of "heritability" and a higher contribution of
the social environment to intellectual development. The results are therefore
consistent with the notion that disadvantaged environments suppress the
influence of predispositions and increase the relative importance of shared
environmental influences (see also Dunne et al., 1997; Heath et al., 1985;
Rowe, Jacobson, & van den Oord, 1999; Scarr-Salapatek, 1971). Turkheimer,
Haley, Waldron, D'Onofrio, and Gottesman (2003) examined scores on the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for a sample of seven-years-old twins from the
National Collaborative Perinatal data. Results indicate that in impoverished
families, the shared environment accounts for 60% of the variance in IQ
whereas genes account for nearly zero. The opposite is found among affluent
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 543
families--the shared environment accounts for almost none of the variance in
IQ whereas genes account for nearly 60%.
These findings are consistent with Raine's (2000) "social push" hypothe-
sis. Specifically, when risk factors (e.g., high poverty, broken homes) that
"push" children into antisocial behavior are not present in the environ-
ment, biological factors may be more relevant in explaining behavioral
differences (see also Mednick, 1977; Raine, 1988; Raine & Venables, 1981).
Raine (2000) posits that in relatively benign social settings (e.g., high social
classes, intact homes), the link between biological risk factors and antiso-
cial behavior will be stronger because the distractions created by social
influences are minimized. In contrast, in disadvantaged social settings with
strong pressures toward anti-social behavior "the link between antisocial
behavior and biological risk factors will be weaker ... because the social
causes of crime camouflage the biological contribution" (Raine, 2000,
p. 314).
An interactional perspective on human development also suggests that the
effect of an individual-difference variable on developmental outcomes may
depend on neighborhood contexts (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; Lewin, 1939; Magnus-
son, 1988). A key prediction derives from the socio-psychological distinction
between weak versus strong situations (Mischel, 1977). "Weak situations refer
to relatively ambiguous social settings that fail to provide individuals with
explicit behavioral norms and scripts .... Individual differences are expected to
shape people's behavior in weak situations because no particular response is
dictated by the circumstances" (Lynam et al., 2000, p. 564). Strong situations
refer to social settings in which there are strong pressures for behavioral unifor-
mity, and are therefore expected to minimize the relevance of person-level
variables. Poor neighborhoods have been conceived of as strong situations that
pressure individuals to behave in antisocial ways. Anderson (1999), for exam-
ple, describes the manner in which youth are socialized to the street culture in
impoverished communities. If poor neighborhoods constitute strong situations,
"person variables are expected to make little contribution to offending in these
contexts but to make strong contributions in the better-off neighborhoods,
which are unlikely to exert strong pressure for antisocial behavior" (Lynam
et al., 2000, p. 564).
The arguments reviewed above suggest alternative hypotheses that predict
a cross-level interaction effect between neighborhood characteristics and
cognitive skill on violence. The idea that person-level characteristics and
environmental risks accumulate and intensify children's vulnerability leads to
the hypothesis that cognitive skill has stronger effects on violence in poor
neighborhoods than in better-off neighborhoods. Based on theorizing about
the role of genetic predisposition under differing social conditions (Guo &
Stearns, 2002), poor neighborhoods as strong situations (Lynam et al., 2000),
and the social push hypothesis (Raine, 2000), one would expect to observe
interaction effects in which cognitive skill has stronger effects on violence in
better-off neighborhoods and weaker effects in poor neighborhoods.

Data and Methods
Sample
The data are drawn from the first five waves of the NLSY97. This is a house-
hold based, nationally representative sample of adolescents between the ages
of 12 and 16 at the time of first interview and who have been interviewed
yearly since 1997. In the first stage, 100 primary sampling units (PSU)
contained in the National Opinion Research Center's (NORC) 1990 national
sampling frame were randomly selected proportionate to size. Segments of
adjoining blocks with at least 75 housing units were selected from each PSU,
and households were randomly selected from a list of housing units in each
segment. Screening interviews in each household resulted in 7,327 eligible
subjects, 6,748 of whom participated, yielding a 92.1% response rate. By the
fifth round, 5,919 respondents completed interviews, yielding an 87.7%
retention rate.4
Because our interest lies in estimating a cross-level interaction between
neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive skills, we further restrict the analysis
to neighborhoods in which there are at least two respondents, reducing the
sample to 5,567 adolescents nested within 1,049 neighborhoods with 27,835
time-varying observations pooled over 5 waves of data (5 × 5,567). Dropping
observations that are not clustered with other cases improves the reliability of
the estimated between neighborhood variance component. Hazard models
reveal no significant differences between the subset of cases eliminated (352
respondents) and the sample utilized in the analysis. The average number of
individuals per census block-group is 5.31, ranging from 2 to 33. Regression
imputation with random error components was used to replace missing values
on explanatory measures (Jinn & Sedransk, 1989). To ensure that the reported
results are not sensitive to imputation, we replicated our models using listwise
deletion of cases with missing values and also mean substitution. There are no
substantive differences.
Level-1 Measures (Time-Varying)
Violence outcome
The number of violent acts committed in each wave is measured with an item
that asks respondents if they have attacked someone with the intention of hurt-
ing them in the past year (or since the date of last interview) and, if yes, to
4. NLSY97 over-sampled African American and Hispanic respondents. We elected against using the
over-sample because the analytic focus of the paper does not specifically address race/ethnicity.
The so called "cross-sectional" sample, which we analyze here, is also preferred because it is self-
weighted--the US population (12­16) is sampled with probability of selection proportionate to size.
The results are substantively identical when the over-sample is included in our analysis.
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 545
indicate the frequency with which they did so.5 The violence outcome is a count
of the number of violent attacks engaged in during each wave and ranges from 0
to 99 events.6 Data indicate that between 6% (Wave 5) and 11.5% (Wave 1) of
the subjects reported at least one attack in each wave. However, a larger
percentage (26.8%) reported that they attacked someone in at least one of five
waves. Given extensive skew, we treat the outcome as a Poisson sampling distri-
bution with constant exposure and over-dispersion.7 Table 1 presents descrip-
tive statistics for variables included in the analysis.
Level-1 control variables
Based on theory and data availability, we include a set of control variables to
partial out the effects of other suspected precursors and correlates of violence.
Age is measured at each wave in months (from last interview) and averages
about 17 years (207 months). Preliminary analysis suggests a nonlinear relation-
ship between age and violence and hence a squared term is included to capture
it. The nonlinear effect is consistent with what would be expected based on the
age­crime curve (see Bilchik, 1998), and is graphically depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Age­violence curve. (NLSY97)
Prior research suggests that residential mobility increases the risk for
violence because it disrupts interpersonal networks and the social capital they
provide (Ingersoll, Scamman, & Eckerling, 1989). Accordingly, a measure is
incorporated that taps the total number of times each respondent has moved
5. In preliminary analysis, we included a measure of prior violence in the model. In a change (i.e.,
group mean centered), model such as the one estimated here the inclusion of prior violence
captures ceiling effects--those who report high levels of violence during early waves are most likely
to reduce their violence involvement over time and those who report little or no violence during
early waves are most likely to avoid violence in the future. Consistent with this logic the effect of
prior violence on violence is negative when included although not significant. Its inclusion does not
alter the pattern of findings.
6. The frequency of violent attacks is the only measure of violence available in NLSY97.
7. For example, Yijk is the number of violent attacks committed during an interval of time with
length mijk termed as "exposure." In our case, Yijk is the number of violent attacks committed
during one year for each person j within each neighborhood k, so that mijk = 1 (i.e., constant expo-
sure). According to our Level-1 model, the predicted value of Yijk when mijk = 1 will be the event
rate, ijk. Specifically, to denote that Yijk has a Poisson distribution with exposure mijk and event
rate per time period of ijk, we write (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002):
The expected value and variance of Yijk, given the event rate ijk, are then:
Thus, the expected number of events, Yijk, per unit of time i for person j within neighborhood k is
the event rate, ijk, multiplied by the exposure, mijk. At Level-1, we model:
where ijk is the log of the event rate. Note that while ijk is constrained to be non-negative,
log(ijk) can take on any value. The predicted log event rate can be converted to an event rate by
generating ijk = exp{ijk}.

(range 0­9). On average, respondents changed residence approximately two
times. A dummy variable is included to adjust for residence in urban locales
(Krivo & Peterson, 1996) where the incidence of violence is expected to be
greater relative to suburban and rural places. On average, 26% of the sample
resided in urban locales. Deviations from the traditional, two-parent family
have been shown in prior research to be consequential for children due to
turmoil/disruption, depressed resources, and a less than ideal socialization
environment (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). "Biological parents" is measured
with a dummy variable that contrasts respondents residing with both biological
parents with subjects that live in other settings (referent). Roughly half of the
respondents resided with both biological parents.

We measure aspects of informal social control (Hirschi, 1969) with binary
variables that distinguish respondents who have dropped out of school, who are
married, who are separated or divorced, and a covariate reflecting the number
of weeks worked during the interview year.8 The measures of informal control
show that on average 8% of the sample did not complete high school (or a GED)
and were not enrolled in school at the time of the interview. Most respondents
were minimally involved in employment activity, on average working about 15
weeks in the previous year, and the vast majority remain unmarried (2%
married).
Gang participation is measured with a binary variable (in gang) that distin-
guishes gang members (coded 1) from non-members. Gang membership is asso-
ciated with heightened violence in previous research (e.g., Thornberry, Krohn,
Lizotte, Smith, & Tobin, 2002). Approximately 5.3% of the sample was active as
a gang member during at least one wave (not shown in the table), although
average membership across five waves is 2%. Given research showing that drug
use is a significant predictor of adolescent violence (Farrington & Loeber, 1999),
we control for variation overtime in each subject's use of drugs (including mari-
juana, cocaine, and heroin) with a dummy variable reflecting use during each
wave (use drugs). A substantial percentage of the sample reported drug use.
Drug selling (sell drugs) is assessed by an item that asks whether subjects sold
drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, etc., in the past 12 months (or since
8. We include these variables to increase the rigor of the models, but because of the relatively
young age of the sample, the level of marital involvement is quite low perhaps explaining its lack of
significance in the analysis presented below.

the date of last interview). Over 17% of the subjects sold drugs during at least
one wave (not shown) and roughly 6% did so in each wave.
Level-2 Measures (Between-Person)
Cognitive skills
The U.S. Department of Defense funded administration of the CAT-ASVAB to
NLSY97 respondents during the first wave for the purpose of establishing
national norms. The CAT-ASVAB comprises 12 separate tests that measure
knowledge and skill in wide ranging competencies and is designed to determine
which job specialties recruits are qualified for. We measure cognitive skills
using the composite reading and math score, which combines the word knowl-
edge, paragraph comprehension, mathematical knowledge, and arithmetic
reasoning subsections.9 The composite measure is preferable because it is age-
normed whereas the subtests are not, and because it is very similar to the AFQT
measure utilized extensively by Herrnstein and Murray (1994) and thus yields a
useful comparison to prior research.10
In our view, which is influenced by Jencks and Phillips (1998), standardized
test scores reflect a complex interaction between genetic endowment and
academic skills acquired through schooling and interaction in multiple social
environments. The term IQ, in our reading of the literature, connotes a more
genetic interpretation. We use the term "cognitive skills" as opposed to intelli-
gence (i.e., IQ) to reflect our view that many, if not most, intelligence or stan-
dardized tests may be more reflective of academic skills and achievement than
innate ability although we do not deny the contribution of endowment. Roberts,
Anjoul, Kyllonen, Pallier, and Stankov (2000) analyzed the factor structure of the
ASVAB and concluded that it measures "crystallized intelligence," which they
define as accumulated knowledge and which is similar to Jencks and Phillips
(1998, p. 13) interpretation of testing as reflecting "developed abilities." More
recently, Koenig, Frey, and Detterman (2008) found that a general factor that
combines the ASVAB subtests correlates highly with several different aptitude
and standardized achievement tests.
We also control, for the self-reported effort, each subject expended during
the ASVAB test. Effort was assessed at the conclusion of the ASVAB administration.
9. The ASVAB math and reading composite correlates highly with a measure we constructed that
combines all of the ASVAB subtests into a principle components factor.
10. The difference between the ASVAB reading and math score available in NLSY97 and the AFQT
measure available in NLSY79 is that the former is administered in a computer-assisted form. This
means that respondents who answered more questions correctly received progressively more diffi-
cult questions and vice versa to reduce the time required to finish the test. Also, the results are
tabulated by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) staff. The AFQT score in the NLSY79, also derived from
the reading and math subsections of the ASVAB, was derived from a paper and pencil rather than
computer-adapted test and its results were tabulated by the Departments of Defense and Military
Services.
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 549
Cognitive skills and effort are coded such that high values reflect greater cognitive
skill and greater effort. To facilitate interpretation of the hypothesized cross-
level interaction effect, cognitive skill is expressed in the analysis as a standard
score with a mean of 0 and SD of 1; effort is grand-mean centered.
Level-2 controls
Family income is included given evidence of an inverse relationship with
violence (Bilchik, 1998). It is measured in dollars and is grand-mean centered in
the analysis. The average family earns $51,521. Measurement of race is based
on self-reported racial background and is represented with dummy variables
contrasting Black (15%), Hispanic (13%), Asian (2%), and other race (6%) with
White (64%) subjects (for a recent discussion of race differences, see McNulty &
Bellair, 2003). Gender is included given well-documented (Farrington & Loeber,
1999) higher rates of violence among males (female is the referent). The sample
is approximately evenly split between males and females. Two covariates
measured during the first wave are included to control the influence of delin-
quent peers (Akers, 1998), reflecting the percentage of each subject's peers in
their grade at school (or when they were in school) that are gang members and
the percentage that use drugs.11 The response set for each item ranges from 1
to 5 with 1 indicating that almost none belong to a gang or use drugs and 5 indi-
cating that almost all (over 90%) belong to a gang or use drugs. The mean for
peer gang membership is 1.47 suggesting that on average less than 25% of
subject's peers are gang members and the mean for peer drug use is 2.23
suggesting that slightly more than 25% of peers use drugs. The measures of peer
processes are grand-mean centered in the analysis.
Level-3 Measures (Between-Neighborhood)
Definition of the geographic size of a neighborhood is a debatable issue. Urban
researchers often use census tracts as a proxy for neighborhood or local area.
We opt instead for block-group, which is roughly one quarter of the population
size of a tract, because census tracts become substantially larger in land area
further away from the inner city. Approximately two-thirds of the subjects
reside in suburban and rural contexts and thus a tract may not correspond with
their conception of neighborhood. Within urban areas, block-group may also be
better than a tract because smaller areas are more socially homogeneous. We
measure neighborhood conditions with block-group data from the 2000 US
11. Peer questions were asked during the first round of data collection only.

Census, which are attached to individual records based on the latitude and
longitude of the respondent's home address during each interview year.12
Neighborhood disadvantage is calculated in two steps. First, we average the
percentage of the population living below the poverty line, the percentage unem-
ployed, and the percentage of households headed by a female across five waves
for each subject. Next, we compute z-scores for each of the three averages and
sum them, yielding the neighborhood disadvantage scale. The component items
load well on a common factor and the resulting index has good internal reliability
(standardized alpha = .83). There is substantial variation in the neighborhood
disadvantage to which adolescents are exposed. The components of our
normalized scale--rates of poverty, unemployment, and female-headed house-
holds--range from 0% to nearly 100% across neighborhoods. We explored adding
additional variables to the scale such as percent on public assistance and percent
black as some researchers have. Those variables do not improve the predictive
utility of the scale. Moreover, we question the theoretical wisdom of adding extra
economic variables into a disadvantage scale because, in so doing, the scale
becomes weighted towards poverty which defeats the purpose of including
unemployment and family structure. Adding percent black to the scale is likewise
problematic in our view because race is included in the model at the individual
level, which makes the interpretation of percent black at the neighborhood level
less clear. Finally, it is also the case that there has been substantial growth in
the number of black middle class neighborhoods across the USA over the past
50 years (Pattillo, 2005) and that undermines the logic of including percent black
in a disadvantage scale. We therefore opted for parsimony and theoretical clarity
in using the three item scale.
Procedure
The Level-1 structural model assumes the form (see Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002):
where ijk is the log violence event rate per unit of time i for person j in
neighborhood k; 0jk is the intercept for person j in neighborhood k; pijk are
time-varying covariates that predict violence and pjk are the corresponding
Level-1 coefficients indicating the association between predictors and the
outcome for person j in neighborhood k; and eijk is a Level-1 random effect that
represents prediction error. At Level 2, random variation in the Level-1 intercept
is modeled with a set of person level characteristics, which can be expressed as
follows:
12. We are unable to explore it in the analysis due to data limitations but we acknowledge the possi-
bility of spatial interdependence.

where 00j is the intercept for the person-level effect 0jk in neighborhood k;
Xpij are person-level characteristics (e.g., cognitive skill) used as predictors;
0pj are the corresponding regression coefficients; and 0ij is a Level-2 random
effect that represents the deviation of person jk's Level-1 coefficient (0jk)
from its predicted value based on the person-level model. The central variable
of interest at Level 2 is the cognitive skills measure.
An analogous modeling process is replicated at the neighborhood level (Level
3), where the intercept and coefficient from the cognitive skills measure at
Level 2 is modeled as a function of neighborhood disadvantage. The general
Level-3 structural model can be expressed with the formula:
where pq0 is the intercept in the neighborhood model for pqk; Wsk is our
measure of neighborhood disadvantage used as a predictor of neighborhood
effects; pqs represents the extent of association between disadvantage (Wsk)
and violence at Level 3 (pqk). Our interest at this stage centers on a cross-level
interaction between cognitive skills at Level 2 and neighborhood disadvantage
at Level 3.
The models include two random effects: (1) a random intercept at Level 2,
which captures variability in the frequency of violence between persons and (2)
a random intercept at Level 3, which captures between-neighborhood variation
in mean violence event rates. Results of unit-specific models with robust stan-
dard errors are presented. We considered a variety of alternative specifications
of the violence outcome, including treating the original and a logged frequency
scale as a normal outcome. Despite substantial skew, the findings are substan-
tively equivalent to those based on the Poisson sampling distribution. We also
carefully examined the models for signs of multicollinearity by examining item
inter-correlations, variance inflation factors (VIFs), and whether standard errors
increase across equations. None of the VIFs came close to exceeding the critical
value of 4.0 (Fisher & Mason, 1981, p. 108) and the other tests also indicate that
multicollinearity is not at play in the analysis.
Results
Table 2 presents Poisson regressions of the frequency of adolescent violent
behavior on cognitive skills and neighborhood disadvantage in a three-level hier-
archical model. The upper panel displays unit-specific fixed effects and the
lower panel displays random effects. Model 1 is the unconditional growth model
of the frequency of violence across the five waves. The estimated mean within
neighborhood log event rate of violence is ­2.238 (p < .01), indicative of overall
low frequencies of violence. Consistent with the literature, and as shown in
Figure 1, the growth trajectory is nonlinear reflecting an age­crime curve of
increasing involvement in violence during early adolescence (12­15), a peak

are statistically significant, indicating significant between-person and between-
neighborhood variability in violence event rates. As is commonly the case, the

bulk of the variance in violence involvement is between-persons (60%), whereas
7% is between-neighborhoods and 33% represents temporal variation at Level 1.
Model 2 incorporates the remaining Level-1 covariates and those from Level 2
into the unconditional growth model. Consistent with prior research, greater
cognitive skill is inversely and strongly associated with violent attacks. A consis-
tent finding in the cognitive skill literature is that the effect of test scores on
violence is mediated by school performance (Bellair & McNulty, 2005; Hirschi &
Hindelang, 1977). Thus, those that possess greater cognitive skill are more likely
to perform well in school which increases their attachment and commitment,
both of which act as a social deterrent to violence. Also notable is that subjects
residing in urban contexts, that are separated or divorced, are gang members,
and are involved with drugs as users or sellers experience an elevated risk for
violence. As expected, being male and having a higher proportion of peers that
are gang members or drug users significantly increases violence event rates,
whereas greater family income reduces it. Interestingly, inclusion of control
variables reduces the age effect to nonsignificance. That result is accounted for
by the joint effects of gang membership, use of drugs, and drug selling (not
shown in the table).
Model 3 incorporates a cross-level interaction between cognitive skill and
neighborhood disadvantage to test alternative hypotheses about the effect of
cognitive skill as disadvantage changes. Findings show a significant main effect
of disadvantage--the mean violence event rate is greater in neighborhoods with
high levels of neighborhood disadvantage. The cross-level interaction between
cognitive skills and disadvantage is highly significant. Table 3 summarizes it by
evaluating the relationship from 2 SD below to 2 SD above the mean level of
neighborhood disadvantage. The interaction reveals that the cognitive skills­
violence relationship is more pronounced in neighborhood contexts with low
levels of disadvantage and that it is not significant when disadvantage rises 2 SD
above the mean (i.e., in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods). This is consistent
with the behavioral genetics approach with its focus on the role of disadvan-
taged social environments in muting the expression of innate potential. In the
following section, we elaborate on the implications of this finding.

Discussion
A voluminous literature (see Ellis & Walsh, 2003) establishes an inverse relation-
ship between cognitive skill and violence. We also find a strong inverse rela-
tionship which lends support to individual difference models. A central issue in
that literature is identifying the mechanism that mediates the relationship. We
emphasize the role of school achievement and attachment because its effect as
a mediator is most consistently supported in previous research (Bellair &
McNulty, 2005; Hirschi & Hindelang, 1977; Lynam et al., 1993; McGloin et. al.,
2004; Ward & Tittle, 1994), whereas less support has accumulated for other
mechanisms such as school reaction (i.e., tracking), deviant peers, and low
self-control.
The analysis extends the literature by asking whether the relationship
between cognitive skill and violence involvement changes at varying levels of
neighborhood disadvantage. Our approach contrasts sharply with the well-known
and often criticized argument that cognitive skill is largely heritable and immu-
table over the life-course (Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Wilson & Herrnstein,
1985). From that perspective, the impact of cognitive skill on a wide range of
outcomes is assumed to be invariant across context. It also contrasts with
approaches that interpret cognitive skill as a barometer of accumulated ability
because that approach rarely if ever conjectures that the relationship operates
differently across levels of neighborhood disadvantage.
We find that the cognitive skill­violence relationship is strongest in advantaged
neighborhoods where the local learning environment is more likely to be well
funded and conducive to enhanced school attachment (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn,
2000). The relationship is weakest (i.e., nonsignificant) in disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods where learning environments are more likely to be ineffective. Results
are therefore consistent with theorizing about the expression of genetic potential
in differing social contexts (Guo & Stearns, 2002), poor neighborhoods as strong
situations (Lynam et al., 2000), and the social push hypothesis (Raine, 2000),
each of which posit that cognitive skill has strong effects on violence in more
affluent neighborhoods and relatively weak effects in poor neighborhoods. Our
results conflict with the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis and are inconsistent
with research indicating that traits such as impulsivity (Lynam et al., 2000) have
stronger effects on some outcomes in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
The results suggest that adolescents residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods
don't derive a protective buffer against violence as they accumulate cognitive
skills over the life course. Rather, in poor neighborhoods, the pathways leading
to mainstream success are often swamped by inequalities such as disorderly
school environments characterized by less motivated or qualified teachers and
low staff morale, and under-funded facilities and programs (Kozol, 1991). A
harsh, disadvantaged social environment is often associated with a "siege
mentality" or a sense of powerlessness that leads to mistrust of local institu-
tions (Ross, Mirowski, & Pribesh, 2001), and those processes may weaken the
linkage between cognitive skills and the formation of strong social bonds such
COGNITIVE SKILLS AND VIOLENCE 555
as attachment and commitment to school. As a result, the protective qualities
of socialization towards conformity that flow from investment in and accumula-
tion of human capital such as cognitive skills don't function as expected in
highly disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Herrnstein and Murray (1994) contend that social problems such as street
crime are much more a function of diminished cognitive ability than poverty or
social class. They argue:
Many people tend to think of criminals as coming from the wrong side of the
track .... But the assumption that too glibly follows from these observations is
that the economic and social disadvantage is in itself the cause of criminal
behavior. That is not what the data say ... much of the attention now given to
problems of poverty and unemployment should be shifted to another question
altogether: coping with cognitive disadvantage. (p. 251)
Herrnstein and Murray (1994) argue that cognitive skills trump disadvantage in
their direct effect on crime, but they fail to recognize that concentration of
neighborhood-level poverty and unemployment quite possibly suppresses the
social impact of cognitive skills. Thus, their conclusion that crime can be
reduced by rendering the operation of the criminal justice system more simple
and transparent so that individuals of low ability can comprehend seems to us
off the mark. Rather, the issue is finding ways to integrate disadvantaged
communities into the social and economic mainstream such that investments in
the development of cognitive skills, whether by individual families or federal
funding of head start programs, can find expression and serve a protective
social function by constraining adolescents from self-destructive violence.
Clearly, neighborhood disadvantage appears to upend a process that functions
efficiently in affluent neighborhoods.
More fundamentally, research that ignores the role of neighborhood disadvan-
tage may over- or under-estimate the effect of cognitive skills on violence
outcomes depending on the distribution of a particular sample across
neighborhoods. The key implication for theory is the need to continue refining
perspectives that theoretically integrate individual difference (i.e., trait) models
with social-structural models of adolescent violence. Such approaches might
suggest significant modifications to existing theory about the role of person-level
variables in varying neighborhood contexts. For instance, personality researchers
have developed important models to summarize the dimensions of psychological
difference (Caspi, 1997), but have devoted little attention towards understanding
how social contexts moderate the effects of those differences on developmental
outcomes. We advocate more research to help unravel this issue, especially
research exploring the moderating role of neighborhood context on a variety of
individual traits in relation to crime outcomes.
The analysis relies on the ASVAB reading and math score to measure cognitive
skill. To be sure, the measure is widely assumed to load highly on the latent
construct intelligence. Nevertheless, a wide variety of cognitive tests have been
used to document the cognitive skill­crime relationship. The analysis reveals
556 BELLAIR AND MCNULTY
that the ASVAB measure is strongly associated with violence, but other research-
ers using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) find that the relationship
is more modest (McGloin et al., 2004). There is very little recognition that the
specific measure of cognitive skill used across studies influences the pattern of
findings. We caution researchers to anticipate complexity in these relations. A
final but important limitation is that we have observed, yet not explained, the
moderating effect of neighborhood contexts on adolescent violence. Identifica-
tion of mediators in the cognitive skill­violence relationship is a crucial future
issue that may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which social contexts
moderate the effects of individual differences on violence outcomes.
