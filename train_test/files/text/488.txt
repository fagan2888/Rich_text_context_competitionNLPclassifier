BACKGROUND: Older adults comprise an increasing
proportion of the prison and homeless populations.
While older age is associated with adverse post-release
health events and incarceration is a risk factor for
homelessness, the health status and homelessness risk
of older pre-release prisoners are unknown. Moreover,
most post-release services are geared towards veterans;
it is unknown whether the needs of non-veterans differ
from those of veterans.
OBJECTIVE: To assess health status and risk of
homelessness of older pre-release prisoners, and to
compare veterans with non-veterans.
DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 360
prisoners (55 years of age) within 2 years of release
from prison using data from the 2004 Survey of
Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities.
MAIN MEASURES: Veteran status, health status (based
on self-report), and risk of homelessness (homelessness
before arrest).
KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 61 years; 93.8% were
men and 56.5% were white. Nearly 40% were veterans,
of whom 77.2% reported likely VA service eligibility.
Veterans were more likely to be white and to have
obtained a high school diploma or GED. Overall, 79.1%
reported a medical condition and 13.6% reported a
serious mental illness. There was little difference in
health status between veterans and non-veterans.
Although 1 in 12 prisoners reported a risk factor for
homelessness, the risk factors did not differ according
to veteran status.
CONCLUSIONS: Older pre-release prisoners had a high
burden of medical and mental illness and were at risk
for post-release homelessness regardless of veteran
status. Reentry programs linking pre-release older
prisoners to medical and psychiatric services and to
homelessness prevention programs are needed for both
veterans and non-veterans.
KEY WORDS: health status; homelessness risk; pre-release prisoners;
older prisoners.

BACKGROUND
The United States has the highest incarceration rate of any
industrialized country, with 1 in 100 American adults incar-
cerated in 2008.1 Longer sentences and reductions in discre-
tionary parole have led to an increased proportion of older
prisoners (55 years of age).1­3 In 2008, 4.1% of US prisoners
were aged 55 or older,4 and substantial increases in the
number of older prisoners are expected.1­3,5 The vast majority
of prisoners (97%) eventually return to the community,6
typically with no health insurance, limited employment pro-
spects, and insufficient finances.7 Most prisoners are released
with a nominal amount of "gate money" (generally 50­100
dollars) and a bus ticket, and half of state correctional
departments provide only a 1­2 week supply of medication.7
Those eligible for government benefits such as Medicaid,
Medicare, and social security income must wait up to 3
months for reinstatement.8­10 Older prisoners are far less
likely than younger prisoners to be reincarcerated after
release.11,12 Compared to younger prisoners, older prisoners
have higher rates of chronic medical conditions and a higher
risk of post-release death,2,13,14 yet little is known about the
health status of older prisoners awaiting release.
Older prisoners may also face challenges to successful
community reentry that compound health problems.17,18 Many
newly released prisoners confront difficulties with employment
and housing,15 and up to half of the nation's homeless have a
history of incarceration.15,16 Although the US homeless popula-
tion has aged over the past several decades,19 and homelessness
is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and acute
health care utilization,20­25 the risk of post-release homelessness
among older adults has not been evaluated. Such information
would be valuable since coordinated treatment programs can
improve health outcomes for homeless adults.22

Because veterans comprise about 10% of the prison popula-
tion26 and one-third of the homeless population,27 the Depart-
ment for Veterans Affairs has spearheaded several nationwide
initiatives to help meet the health care and housing needs of
veterans being released from prisons.28,29 However, services for
non-veteran released prisoners are poorly established and are
available only on a state-by-state basis.6,30 It is unclear if the
reentry needs of non-veterans differ from those of veterans,
raising the question of whether similar interventions should be
targeted to non-veterans. We assessed and compared the health
status and risk of homelessness among older veteran and non-
veteran prisoners who were within 2 years of release.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 360 prisoners, aged 55
or older, who were within 2 years of release from a US federal or
state prison using data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in
State and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISFCF). The SISFCF
targets a nationally representative, random sample of US
prisoners who participate in confidential interviews conducted
by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS).31 The self-report medical questions were developed by
BJS from health questions in other national health surveys.32
We included prisoners within 2 years of release to characterize
the health status and risk of homelessness of older adults who
would soon reenter the community. Consistent with prior
literature, we defined "older" prisoners as those who were
55 years to reflect the increased and premature burden of
illness and disability occurring among prisoners in comparison
to non-prisoners.2,3,33,34
Overall, 14,499 prisoners from 287 state prisons and 3,686
prisoners from 39 federal prisons were randomly selected to
participate in the 2004 SISFCF. The response rate was 89% for
state and 84% for federal prisoners.31 Of 18,185 participants,
974 (5.35%) were 55 years of age. Among these older prison-
ers, 37.0% were within 2 years of anticipated release, resulting
in a final sample size of 360.
Measures
Health Status. Health status was based on self-report of 11
chronic medical conditions and 3 categories of serious mental
illnesses. The 11 medical conditions included current cancer or
paralysis, and current or past diagnosis of hypertension, brain
injury or stroke, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems,
arthritis, asthma, cirrhosis, or hepatitis. The three categories of
serious mental illnesses included depressive disorders, bipolar
disorder, and schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. We
reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately from
serious mental illness to be consistent with prior literature.35,36
The SISFCF used brief questions to elicit medical histories (e.g.,
"Have you ever had high blood pressure or hypertension?").
Survey participants who reported a history of cancer or paralysis
were asked if the condition was still present. To ascertain mental
health status, participants were provided a list of psychiatric
disorders and asked if a mental health professional had ever told
them they had any of the conditions. To assess disability status,
we analyzed responses to four questions: (1) "Do you use a cane,
wheelchair, walker, hearing aid, or other aids to help you with
your daily activities?" (2) "Do you consider yourself to have a
disability?" (3) "Do you have difficulty hearing a normal
conversations even when wearing a hearing aid?" (4) "Do you
have difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint, even when wearing
glasses?" Self-report of medical conditions and disability is well
validated in older adults.37­40
Risk of Homelessness. Risk of homelessness was primarily defined
with two measures: self-report of homelessness at the time of
arrest and/or having been homeless at any time in the 12 months
prior to arrest. Respondents who answered they were living "on the
street or in a homeless shelter" were categorized as homeless. We
chose these criteria because a history of homelessness is a strong
predictor of post-release homelessness.41 In order to better
characterize the spectrum of homelessness beyond living on a
street or in a shelter,42,43 we also examined a history of marginal
homelessness: those who reported living in a hotel, motel, or
rooming house upon arrest. Because decreased social contacts
can confer added homelessness risk,44,45 we also identified those
who planned to live alone following release.
Veteran Status. We determined veteran status based on the
question: "Did you ever serve in the US Armed Forces?"
Respondents were categorized according to their service era,
self-reported combat status ("During this time did you see
combat in a combat or line unit?"), and discharge type
(honorable/general with honorable conditions versus other
discharge type). However, in the main analyses, we compared
all veterans, regardless of discharge type, to all non-veterans
because even veterans with dishonorable discharges can
sometimes become eligible for VA benefits.46,47
Other Demographic Characteristics. We characterized
participants according to their sociodemographic characteristics,
including age, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational
attainment (having a high school diploma or GED vs. not), and
pre-incarceration employment. We also characterized criminal
history (age at first and current arrest, total arrests, and number
of years currently incarcerated). We characterized substance
abuse history using CAGE questionnaire data to assess alcohol
dependence and the Texas Christian University Drug Screen
(TCUDS), which was developed to assess drug dependence in the
correctional setting.48 By convention, a CAGE alcohol dependency
score of 2 or a TCUDS score of 3 indicates a substance abuse
problem.48,49
Statistical Analyses
We examined the differences between veterans and non-veterans
according to sociodemographics, employment history, criminal
history, health conditions (medical and psychiatric), and risk of
homelessness. All reported results were weighted to account for
the sampling design in order to obtain nationally representative
results.

This study was approved by the Committee on Human
Research at University of California, San Francisco and the
San Francisco VA Medical Center, and was conducted using
publicly available, de-identified data. All statistical analyses
were performed using STATA software version 10.1 (STATA
Corporation, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Characteristics of Older Prisoners Within 2 Years
of Release
The mean age of the sample was 61 years (range 55­84).
Overall, 7.1% of the prisoners were 70 years of age, 93.8%
were men, 30.4% were married, 56.5% were white, and 69.7%
were employed before arrest. Of those who were employed,
87.2% had full-time jobs. Participants had been incarcerated
for an average of 7.5 years and had an average of 3.1 prior
arrests (Table 1).
Characteristics According to Veteran Status
Overall, 142 (39.8%) of the pre-release older prisoners were
veterans. The veterans were more likely than non-veterans to
be men, married, and to have a high school diploma or GED
(Table 1). Veterans were more likely to identify as white (76.7%
vs. 43.3%) and less likely to identify as black (15.6% vs. 31.9%)
or Latino/Hispanic (4.3% vs. 22.2%). Veteran status was not
related to employment prior to arrest, monthly income less
than $1,000 in the month preceding arrest, number of prior
arrests, age at first or current arrest, or number of years
incarcerated.
The majority of veterans served in the Vietnam-era (69.4%),
between the Korea and Vietnam eras (14.1%), the Korean era
(9.8%), or the Pre-Korean era (5.1%). Thirty-five percent of the
veterans had served in active combat, and 77.2% had received
an honorable or general (with honorable conditions) discharge.
Health Status of Older Prisoners
Nearly 80% of older pre-release prisoners reported one or more
medical conditions with an average of 2.1 (Table 2). The most
common medical conditions included hypertension (51.8%),
arthritis (43.6%), and "heart problems" (34.1%). Additionally,
30.7% of the older prisoners reported having a disability,
13.6% reported at least one serious mental illness, and 8.1%
reported a history of hospitalization in a mental health facility.
A quarter had a TCUDS score of 3, suggestive of drug
dependency, and nearly half (45.6%) had a positive CAGE
score for alcohol dependency.
Health Status According to Veteran Status
Veterans and non-veterans reported a similar average number
of medical conditions (2.1 vs. 2.0, p=0.55), and similar rates of

each medical condition and serious mental illness with the
exception of asthma (19.6% vs. 10.0%, p=0.02) and PTSD
(12.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001). Combat veterans were more likely
to report PTSD than non-combat veterans (23.6% vs. 6.5%, p=
0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in PTSD
between non-combat veterans and non-veterans (6.5% vs.
2.3%, p=0.08). Although there was no relationship between
veteran status and alcohol or drug dependency, not all
respondents answered all relevant items; 57.3% of subjects
answered all CAGE alcohol dependency questions and 47.1%
answered all TCU drug dependency questions. These percen-
tages did not differ for veterans compared to non-veterans for
TCU questions (43.6% vs. 49.4%, p=0.32) but did differ for
CAGE questions (64.7% vs. 52.5%, p=0.04). Veterans and
non-veterans were equally likely to consider themselves to
have a disability (33.3% vs. 29.0%, p=0.43). However, veterans
were more likely to report difficulty hearing (26.1% vs. 14.6%,
p=0.01).
Risk of Homelessness According to Veteran Status
Overall, 8.4% of participants reported at least one of the
homelessness risk factors, including being homeless at some
point during the year prior to arrest (7.4% of respondents),
living on the street or in a homeless shelter upon arrest (1.7%),
and living in a motel, hotel, or rooming house upon arrest
(2.3%) (Table 1). These experiences were similar for veterans
and non-veterans. Older veterans were not more likely than
non-veterans to expect to live alone after release (31.6% vs.
24.3%, p=0.16).
DISCUSSION
As the American population ages, the number of incarcerated
and homeless older adults is increasing rapidly.1­3,19 We found
that older veteran and non-veteran prisoners who were within
2 years of release had a similar burden of medical and
psychiatric conditions, and an equal number of risk factors
for homelessness.
Appropriate targeting of community-based medical ser-
vices to the growing number of newly released older prisoners
is hampered by inadequate information about their health
needs.17 A survey of returning prisoners of all ages showed
that one-third of those with physical or mental health
conditions used emergency room care and one-fifth were

hospitalized within 8­10 months after release.50 Another
survey found that most older prisoners had fears about
their post-incarceration health.18 Former prisoners have a
12.7-fold increased risk of death in the 2 weeks following
release (even excluding seriously ill prisoners granted com-
passionate medical release); the most common causes of
death for those over age 45 are cardiovascular disease and
cancer.14 We found that nearly 80% of older pre-release
prisoners in our sample reported at least one chronic medical
condition (average of 2.1) and that the rates of many medical
conditions exceeded those reported in the community.51
These findings highlight the importance of pre-release health
care planning for older prisoners.
The prevalence of serious mental illness in older commu-
nity-dwelling adults is 15%­20%.35 A current or past history
of serious mental illness was reported by 13.6% of our
sample, similar to rates reported among older prisoners in
Texas (11.0%),36 Tennessee (16.0%),35 and Utah (13.6%).35
The actual proportion of our sample burdened with signifi-
cant mental illness is undoubtedly higher than 13.6%
because PTSD was excluded from the "serious mental illness"
category. This exclusion is the result of an operational
definition created to maintain consistency and comparability
with other studies and is not intended to imply that PTSD is
not a serious mental illness. There is a complex relationship
among mental illness, homelessness, and incarceration, and
a heightened risk of both recidivism and homelessness
among released prisoners with mental illness has been
observed.36,52,53 Additionally, homeless adults with mental
illness and an incarceration history have a higher likelihood
of experiencing long-term homelessness than those without
mental illness.54 These findings underscore the importance
of providing linkages to community-based mental health
services for older released prisoners.
Because of the association between homelessness and
increased acute health care utilization and mortality,20­25
homelessness prevention strategies have received increasing
attention.44 A history of incarceration is a risk factor for
homelessness,41,44,55 and between 6.3% and 11.4% of pris-
oners of all ages use homeless shelters following release.41 At
least 8.4% of our sample was at risk for homelessness (based
on a prior history of homelessness) and more than a quarter
expected to live alone following release. These findings suggest
that expanded efforts to secure housing for pre-release older
prisoners are warranted.
Although pre-release health care and homelessness
prevention planning for all older prisoners is needed, well-
established and coordinated programs are typically available
only to veterans. In 2001, Congress mandated that the
Department of Veterans Affairs collaborate with the Depart-
ment of Labor and the Bureau of Prisons to assist veterans
during reentry.28 This collaboration culminated in the
Incarcerated Veterans Transition Program in 2003, a demon-
stration program providing incarcerated veterans with con-
nections to housing, health care, training, and employment.56
The Healthcare for Reentry Veterans Program, implemented
in 2007, has provided outreach and reentry services to over
12,000 veterans in 451 state and federal prisons through
June of 2009.57 Our study showed that 77% of pre-release
older prisoners who were veterans reported military dis-
charges with conditions likely to make them eligible for VA
services. In addition, while veterans comprise about 10% of
the state prison population,26 nearly 40% of our sample of
older prisoners were veterans. This highlights the importance
of the VA's outreach efforts for this segment of the incarcerated
population.
Conversely, 60% of our sample of older prisoners were non-
veterans, underscoring the importance of developing national
transition programs for non-veterans for whom existing
services are limited.58 While non-veterans on parole may
receive reentry assistance via a parole officer or formal parole
programs, such services are diminishing with increasing
non-parole releases and parole officer caseloads.58 Although
the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, established in
2003, provided more than $100 million to local reentry program
development, the programs only focused on prisoners aged 35
and younger.30,59
Although coordinated reentry programs for non-veteran
older prisoners are lacking, we found that rates of poor health
status and risk of homelessness were just as high among this
group as among veterans. Unfortunately, most states termi-
nate Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security Disability
Income eligibility during incarceration,8­10 and reinstituting
coverage can take up to 3 months.8,9 Given the high costs of
emergency department services and the high risk of home-
lessness, all pre-release older prisoners should receive assis-
tance with securing housing, medical care, and reinstatement
of benefits, and should be screened for eligibility for VA
services.
A strength of our study was that it included a random,
nationally representative sample of US prisoners. Limitations
included the use of self-reported data, although the majority
of studies have found relatively strong agreement between
self-report and medical record validation of major medical
conditions in older adults.37­40 A validation of the medical
questions in the SISFCF did identify some underreporting of
medical conditions compared with administrative medical
data.32 Although we do not know the extent of underreport-
ing, the fact that Census Bureau employees conducted the
survey and that no financial incentive was offered for
participation likely minimized any incentives to provide
inaccurate information. Additionally, underreporting of med-
ical conditions would strengthen our finding that pre-release
older adults have more medical conditions than nonincar-
cerated older adults. Also, it is possible that some veterans in
our sample failed to self-identify, while other respondents
falsely identified themselves as veterans. Given that we found
few differences between the two groups, this possibility is
unlikely to have affected our findings. Finally, because this
study was cross-sectional, we were unable to determine how
many respondents actually experienced homelessness after
reentry. Prospective studies are needed to assess rates of
homelessness, medical decompensation, and mortality
among older released prisoners.
To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the
health status and homelessness risk for older pre-release
prisoners. We found that such prisoners had high rates of
medical conditions, serious mental illness, and risk of post-
release homelessness, regardless of veteran status. While
national reentry planning programs for veterans are expand-
ing, the overwhelming similarity in poor health status and
homelessness risk between older veterans and non-veterans
suggests that programs of equal breadth and caliber are
needed for non-veteran older prisoners.
