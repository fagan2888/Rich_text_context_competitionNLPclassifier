Abstract
Most Veterans who use the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) also utilize private-sector health care providers. To
better inform local and regional health care planning, we assessed the association between reliance on VHA ambulatory
care and total and system-specific preventable hospitalization rates (PHRs) at the state level. We conducted a retrospective
dynamic cohort study using Veterans with diabetes mellitus, aged 66 years or older, and dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare
parts A and B from 2004 to 2010. While controlling for median age and proportion of males, we measured the association
between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs at the state level using multivariable ordinary least square regression,
geographically weighted regression, and generalized additive models. We measured geospatial patterns in PHRs using global
Moran's I and univariate local indicator spatial analysis. Approximately 30% of hospitalized Veterans experienced a preventable
hospitalization. Reliance on VHA ambulatory care at the state level ranged from 13.92% to 67.78% and was generally not
associated with PHRs. Geospatial analysis consistently identified a cluster of western states with low PHRs from 2006 to
2010. Given the generally low reliance on VHA ambulatory care and lack of association between this reliance and PHRs, policy
changes to improve Veterans' health care outcomes should address private-sector care in addition to VHA care.

Introduction
Diabetes is a common chronic condition. The prevalence of
diabetes is over 9% in the general US population and
approximately 25% among Veterans actively utilizing the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA).1,2 Regular health
care visits to primary care providers and specialists are
prominent features of diabetes management. Of 22 million
living Veterans, 9 million have enrolled in Veterans Affairs
(VA) services and 5.9 million are regular users of the VHA.3
VHA offers a spectrum of integrated health care services
including preventive, ambulatory, and inpatient care. VHA
functions as a safety net provider for some Veterans, poten-
tially mitigating the effects of barriers to accessing private-
sector health care services. VHA also utilizes an integrated
electronic medical record system, which makes all care
received within the system available to all VHA providers
and facilitates better care coordination within the system.
Studies have reported better uptake of preventive services
in the VHA as compared with the private sector.4-7
Numerous studies have also indicated that VHA performs
better than the private sector in the ambulatory care and
management of diabetes, including diabetes care processes,
2 INQUIRY
preventive services, patient satisfaction, patient education,
and management of blood sugar and cholesterol levels.7,8
Despite the promise of comprehensive and coordinated
care, few veterans receive all of their care from VHA.9-11
For example, among Medicare eligible veterans, a plurality
(46%) utilize VHA and private-sector services.12 Although
having coverage for services in 2 systems may result in
increased choice and improved access to care, some studies
indicate that Veterans who receive care outside of the VHA
are more likely to experience poor outcomes.13,14
Preventable hospitalizations (PHs) reflect access to high-
quality ambulatory care. They represent potentially avoid-
able hospitalizations for conditions that can be controlled
with timely access to high-quality ambulatory care.15,16 The
ambulatory care may not prevent disease progression, but if
proper care is received in a timely manner, hospitalization
for complications may be less likely.
Although VHA and Medicare are federally funded and
operated programs, regional variations in utilization pat-
terns and distribution of resources have been observed in
both programs.17-19 For instance, the administrative region
of VHA made up of northeastern states was found to have
the greatest rate of hospitalizations as compared with
regions in the rest of the country.17 Availability of VHA
resources also varies at the state level with the number of
operational VA medical centers ranging from 1 in the state
of Alaska to 14 in the state of New York.19 Multiple studies
have also found differences (at state or hospital referral
level) in the amount of Medicare spending per beneficiary
and the quality of care received.18,20-22 The ratio of provid-
ers to persons, which may impact access to Medicare pro-
viders, also varies drastically from state to state. For
example, in 2012, there were 94 primary care physicians
(PCPs) per 100,000 population in the state of Hawaii but
only 27 PCPs per 100,000 population in Mississippi.23
Such variation in health care resources may impact
patients' access to care, regardless of health care coverage.
State laws and policies directly regulate many aspects of
health care delivery (eg, medical professional licensure,
certification for large capital investments, insurance cover-
age), making state-level analyses important and relevant
for health services research.
We explore variability in state-level VHA and private-
sector preventable hospitalization rates (PHRs) among veter-
ans with diabetes dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare. This
population offers a unique opportunity to examine the poten-
tial impact of dual-system ambulatory care use on PHs.
Given the VHA's integrated system, we hypothesize that
states in which Veterans demonstrate greater reliance on
VHA ambulatory care will demonstrate lower PHRs. The
findings have implications for state and federal policies
regarding Veteran utilization of and access to high-quality
ambulatory care, more generally.
Materials and Methods
IRB Approval
Our study was approved via an expedited review by the
Veterans Affairs New Jersey Healthcare System's
Institutional Review Board (IRB) (study IRB No. 01191).
Given that our study is a retrospective assessment of data
from de-identified medical records, we were approved for
waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) authorization and waiver of patient consent.
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective dynamic cohort study with cal-
endar years 2006-2010 serving as the outcome years and the
24 months preceding each outcome year serving as a base-
line period. We identified the state of residence during the
outcome year for each VHA user with diabetes.
Data Sources
The data we used for this study included 2004-2010 demo-
graphic summary, inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care
file extracts from VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)
production tables and VA Information Resource Center
(VIReC) Medicare and Medicaid data files.24,25
We used SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 software for data
cleaning and manipulation on Veterans Affairs Informatics
and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), the VA's cloud plat-
form for data analytics.26,27
Sample Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The study population consisted of Veterans with diabetes
mellitus type 1 or 2, who were 66 years of age or older as of
January 1 of each baseline period and dually enrolled in
VHA and Medicare during baseline and outcome years. To
identify patients with diabetes, we modified the method pub-
lished by Miller et al.28 We defined diabetes based on at least
1 inpatient stay or 2 outpatient face-to-face visits associated
with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code
for diabetes mellitus (250.xx) during the baseline period. We
defined face-to-face visits as in-person encounters involving
a clinician with independent decision-making capacity; we
identified face-to-face visits based on Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes associated with each visit.
We excluded patients from the study for the following
reasons in the order listed: died before start of outcome year,
lacked continuous (full 36 months) Medicare part A and B
coverage during study period, participated in a Health
Maintenance Organization (HMO) for 1 month or longer
during study period, used hospice services or experienced at
Helmer et al 3
least 1 long-term stay at a skilled nursing facility during
study period, experienced a hospital stay of longer than 180
days during the study period, and/or did not have an outpa-
tient face-to-face visit or an inpatient stay in either system
during baseline years.
Dependent Variable
Our outcome of interest was any PH experienced by the
patient during the outcome years 2006-2010. We adopted the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) def-
inition of the Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) as our
definition of PHs.29 We identified PQIs based on the associ-
ated ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. PQIs we measured
included (1) diabetes short-term complications, (2) diabetes
long-term complications, (3) chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, (4) asthma,(5) hypertension, (6) congestive heart
failure, (7) dehydration, (8) bacterial pneumonia infections,
(9) urinary tract infections, (10) angina without a procedure,
(11) uncontrolled diabetes, and (12) lower extremity
amputations.
We calculated PHRs by dividing the total number of
unique patients in each state who experienced at least 1 epi-
sode of a PH during the outcome year by the number who
were hospitalized during the outcome year. We distinguished
between total PHR (Medicare [MC] and VHA PHRs com-
bined) and system-level PHR (ie, MC PHR and VHA PHR).
Independent Variables
The key independent variable in our analysis was percent
reliance on VHA ambulatory care. We adjusted for median
age of patients and proportion of males. We measured all
variables at the patient level and aggregated to the state level.
We defined reliance on VHA as the proportion of all outpa-
tient face-to-face visits that were made to VHAfacilities [VHA
visits / (VHA visits + Medicare visits)]. We measured utiliza-
tion of ambulatory care services as the number of outpatient
face-to-face visits made by patients residing in a particular
state to providers in the VHA and in the Medicare system dur-
ing the baseline period. We excluded visits associated with
urgent care (VHA-associated primary clinic stop code: emer-
gency medicine, admitting/screening, emergency department,
observation emergency room, observation psychiatry, obser-
vation rehabilitation, observation spinal cord, observation
medicine, observation neurology, observation surgery, and
urgent care unit; Medicare-treating provider was listed as
emergency medicine, or the revenue center code listed on the
claim was associated with emergency medicine).
Spatial and Statistical Analyses
Geomapping.We mapped the state-level total PHR, VHA
PHR, and MC PHR using ArcGIS 10.3.30 Given the distribu-
tion of data, we used 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40% as the
cutoff points to group state-level PHRs in each year.
Global Moran's I and LISA. We used global Moran's I to deter-
mine whether there are clustering of PHRs among states. The
global Moran's I is an indicator of spatial association and
ranges between -1 (clustering of dissimilar values) and +1
(clustering of similar values). A value of 0 for Moran's I indi-
cates absence of clusters.
We used the univariate local indicator spatial analysis
(LISA) to identify the location and type of clusters present.31
Spatial patterns which can be visualized with this technique
include low-low cluster, high-high cluster, high-low outlier,
and low-high outlier. For example, high-high cluster indi-
cates that a state with higher than average value of PHs is
surrounded by neighboring states with higher than average
value of PHs. High-low and low-high outliers indicate ran-
dom dispersion of PHR rates.
OLS regression. We used multivariable ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression to evaluate the association between reli-
ance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs at the state level. In
these models, a negative coefficient indicates that higher
reliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with lower
PHRs and a positive coefficient indicates that higher reliance
on VHA ambulatory care is associated with higher PHRs.
GWR.
We also used geographically weighted regression
(GWR) to summarize spatially varying relationships between
VHA reliance and PHRs. GWR is a local spatial statistical
technique that can be applied to produce locally specific param-
eters and to, therefore, examine the regression parameter vary-
ing across states.32 GWR operates under the assumption that
information from nearby states is more important than distant
states. We calculated separate t statistics for each centered state
and used the cutoff points ±1.96 to identify correlations
between the VHA ambulatory care reliance and PHRs.
GAM. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to reassess
the association between VHA ambulatory care reliance and
PHRs while controlling for any variance that may result from
physical geographic differences among states. GAM is a non-
parametric generalization of multiple linear regression which
can identify a more realistic effect of the geographic location by
use of smooth functions instead of least squares fit.33
We used the "mgcv" package in R for the GAMs, GWR
4.0 for the GWRs, and GeoDa 1.6.7 for the LISAs.33-37 We
used a P value of .05 to assess significance for all analyses.
We used 50 observations (one for each state) for the OLS,
GWR, and the GAM analyses.
Results
Cohort characteristics for all outcome years have been sum-
marized at the state level in Table 1. The cohort (sample size
range: 524,530-572,461) primarily consisted of males aged
73 to 77 years. In any given outcome year, of those patients
who utilized inpatient services (sample size range: 148,060-
150,808), at the state level, on average, 17% or less had at

Notes: VHA=Veteran's Health Administration; MC=Medicare; PHR=preventable hospitalization rate. We used cut-off points of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and
40% to group state-level PHRs in each year
least 1 hospital stay at a VHA facility. Throughout the study
period, the cohort's state-level reliance on VHA ambulatory
care ranged from 13.92% to 67.78%. On average, approxi-
mately 30% of those hospitalized experienced at least 1 PH
during any given outcome year.
Figure 1 is the choropleth maps for the state-level PHRs.
The state-level total PHR varied from 21% to 37% from 2006
to 2010. The VHAPHR ranged from as low as 18% to as high
as 60%. The Medicare PHR ranged from 19% to 38%.
We found significant clustering of state-level total PHR and
MC PHR (global Moran's Is > 0.20; P < .05 in all years).
However, we did not find any significant clustering of VHA
PHR (data not shown). Using the univariate LISAs, we identi-
fied low-low clusters of total PHR and MC PHR among many
states in the western region of the United States from 2006 to
2010 (Figure 2). The low-low cluster indicated states with lower
than average PHRs were surrounded by states with lower than
average PHRs. A high-high cluster was inconsistently present
around the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio for all years in
total PHRs and MC PHRs.
Table 2 presents the results from our regression models of
the state-level association between VHA ambulatory reliance
and total and system-level PHRs, controlling for sex and
median age. Based on the OLS model, we observed a signifi-
cant positive association between VHA ambulatory care reli-
anceandVHAPHRonlyin2006andbetweenVHAambulatory

associations were observed between VHA ambulatory care

ambulatory care reliance and total PHR in 2008 and between
VHA reliance and VHA PHR in 2006 only. We found no sig-
nificant geographic patterns in the association between VHA
ambulatory care reliance and MC PHR. Using a generalized
additive model controlling for physical geographic variations
among states, we found a significant association between VHA
ambulatory care reliance and VHA PHR in 2006 only (Table
2). Overall, there were few statistically significant relationships
between VHA ambulatory care reliance and PHRs at the state
level between 2006 and 2010 (Table 2).
Discussion
Contrary to our hypothesis, across study years, state-level
VHA reliance on ambulatory care was only rarely associated
with PHs and the strength of association was weak. Given

the integrated nature of the VHA system and numerous pub-
lications touting VHA success in ambulatory care through
various metrics, we expected higher state-level reliance on
VHA ambulatory care to be associated with lower PHRs.
Failure to demonstrate this association using several analytic
approaches raises the possibility that despite greater reliance
on VHA ambulatory care services, other factors negate the
expected benefits in VHA quality of and access to
8 INQUIRY
ambulatory care for veterans at the state level. In support of
our findings, some published analyses have found that dual
VHA and Medicare health care utilization may actually com-
promise quality of care or result in provision of redundant ser-
vices.13,14,38 Perhaps the fragmentation of care resulting from
the use of ambulatory care services across systems cancels
out the benefits of utilizing superior VHA services.
It is also possible that differences in the quality of ambu-
latory care between VHA and private-sector providers are
not sufficient to impact the PHR at the state level. However,
this would contradict numerous reports of the superiority of
VHApreventiveanddiabetesambulatorycare.4-8 Equivalency
between VHA and private-sector ambulatory care is not the
most plausible explanation for our finding of no association
between PHs and the reliance on VHA ambulatory care. The
most likely explanation for the observed lack of association
is based on the fact that reliance on VHA outpatient services
in this sample was generally less than 30% and decreased
slightly over the study period. This relatively low reliance on
VHA services is consistent with other published reports of
dual-system use.12,14,39-41 This may explain why reliance on
VHA ambulatory care, despite being widely acknowledged
as equivalent or even superior to private sector, was not asso-
ciated with PHRs at the state level. Perhaps the overall utili-
zation of VHA ambulatory services by elderly veterans with
diabetes does not achieve the minimal threshold of engage-
ment with VHA ambulatory services necessary to reap the
benefits. Further research is necessary to explore these pos-
sible explanations.
Our analysis is the most comprehensive examination of
PHRs among VHA users reported in the literature. As
expected, most dually enrolled Veterans who were hospital-
ized experienced their inpatient stay in the private sector
(>80% across study years), not VHA. This reliance on the
private sector for inpatient services varied little across states
and study years, indicating a pervasive and enduring pattern
and underscoring the importance of including data from
VHA and non-VHA sources. Because we examined the total-
ity of hospitalizations considered preventable, our findings
are more robust and meaningful than if we had considered
VHA or private-sector hospitalizations in isolation. For vet-
erans who use both VHA and private-sector ambulatory care,
apportioning responsibility for PHs to one or the other sys-
tem is impossible. In absolute terms, PHs are an uncommon
outcome; fewer than 10% of veterans in our sample experi-
enced a PH per year, and only 1% to 2% experienced a PH in
VHA. Limiting our sample to those with a hospitalization
enriches the prevalence of the outcome and also partially
controls for unmeasured severity of illness and disease sever-
ity. By aggregating patient experience to the state level,
including both VHA and private-sector hospitalizations, lim-
iting the statistical modeling to only those with a hospitaliza-
tion, and using multiple modeling approaches, we designed
our analyses with the power to detect even a small
association between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and
PHR at the state level and yet did not find this association.
Our state-level findings of PHRs are consistent with other
studies of health care quality, supporting our use of PHRs as
a focus for these analyses. There is a range of PHRs across
states, although the PHRs of each state are largely consistent
across study years. The presence of a cluster of states in the
Western United States with lower PHRs throughout the study
years suggests that broader market forces, patient prefer-
ences, or standards of practice may be a stronger influence
on state PHR than VHA reliance. The high-high cluster
inconsistently present in the central Midwest region over the
study years similarly speaks to a regional effect. The states
with the highest PHRs according to our calculations (see
Supplemental Table 1) are Louisiana (LA), Kentucky (KY),
West Virginia (WV), Indiana (IN), Ohio (OH), Massachusetts
(MA), and Rhode Island (RI). At the other end of the rank-
ings, Utah (UT), Idaho (ID), Arizona (AZ), Florida (FL),
Hawaii (HI), Washington (WA), and California (CA) are
consistently among the states with the lowest PHRs.
According to America's Health Rankings, an annual compi-
lation of state-level health and health care statistics, LA, WV,
KY, OH, and IN also consistently rank among the 10 states
with the highest PHRs for Medicare enrollees.42 MA and RI
rank in the bottom 40% for PHRs among Medicare enrollees.
Consistent with our findings of low PHRs for veterans with
diabetes, UT, ID, HI, WA, AZ, and CA are among the states
with the lowest PHRs for Medicare enrollees. Florida, on the
contrary, ranks in the bottom half for PHR.43 The discrep-
ancy between PHRs for veterans of Florida indicates the pos-
sibility that Veterans' health care experience may differ from
that of non-Veterans, at least in some states. Overall, how-
ever, our PHRs are consistent with the experience in most of
the states with PHRs at either end of the spectrum, support-
ing the external validity of our findings.
Our findings may be applicable to other cohorts of VHA
users, as most veterans use a combination of VHA and pri-
vate-sector care. Dual-system use is likely to increase further
through the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act
of 2014 (PL 113-146; "Veterans Choice Act"). The Veterans
Choice Act allows eligible Veterans who have difficulty
receiving care at a VHA facility (for reasons such as long
travel time and/or unavailability of appointments) to receive
care from private-sector providers in their community at the
expense of theVHA. Since the implementation of theVeterans
Choice Act, 500 000 private-sector providers have joined the
VHA network to provide care to Veterans in the community.44
Strengthening and adapting the relationship with these pro-
viders may be an opportunity to experiment with care coordi-
nation and other interventions to improve quality and access
to ambulatory care. Exploring the relationship between reli-
ance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs in younger groups
of VHA users, in particular, will require analysis of data from
VHA and commercial insurance plans.
Helmer et al 9
Our findings indicate that federal and state policy makers
may wish to more closely examine the role of VHA ambula-
tory services for elderly Veterans with diabetes who are
enrolled in both VHA and the Medicare program within a
state. The lack of association between reliance on VHA
ambulatory care and PHs may signal a limited role for VHA
in the totality of care for this population and suggest new
interventions to optimize the use of health care resources at a
state level. To date, VHA's efforts to monitor and improve
quality of care focused primarily on VHA facilities. Our find-
ings suggest that additional care coordination resources, a
major focus of preventing hospitalizations and rehospitaliza-
tions,42,45 may have a greater impact on veterans' health if
directed toward care in the private sector. However, given the
low rates of hospitalization of these veterans in VHA, perhaps
VHA should focus on ambulatory care and improved coordi-
nation of care, rather than on inpatient services. Although the
state-level variability in VHA ambulatory care reliance and
hospitalization rates was not large, it is possible that different
approaches may be more effective in different states.
Strengths and Weaknesses
These analyses of PHRs represent an overview of state-level
ambulatory care for older Veterans with diabetes and test the
hypothesis that VHA reliance on ambulatory care is associ-
ated with PHRs at the state level. We captured the entire
population of VHAusers with diabetes over 65 years old dur-
ing the study years, a strength of this analysis. We also used
the PQI methodology, an accepted industry standard, for
determining PHRs. The utility of this methodology, although
not universally accepted, has been recognized through con-
tinued promulgation by health care policy and research enti-
ties. The data used in the analyses include VHA clinical and
both VHA and Medicare claims data and represent a near
totality of inpatient and ambulatory care services for this
population. By utilizing several different models to analyze
the geographic variation at the state level, we are confident
that the findings are robust. There is the possibility of misat-
tribution of individual veterans' care to a state if their resi-
dence was different from the state in which they received
health care; we suspect that outpatient VHA care mostly
occurred in the state of residence. In addition, we arbitrarily
chose the state of residence at the beginning of the outcome
year, resulting in possible misclassification due to receipt of
ambulatory care during the baseline period being in a differ-
ent state from the outcome year. However, state of residence
changed for less than 2% of any outcome year cohort between
first and second baseline years (data not shown). Therefore,
we do not anticipate misattributed state of residence to affect
our results in a meaningful way.
We did not include Medicaid and other non-Medicare
private-sector care in our analysis. Only 6% of the cohort
was enrolled in Medicaid in any given year (data not shown).
Because Medicare is the primary payer for individuals dually
enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, our analysis captures
any services covered by both plans. Common Medicaid ser-
vices, such as nursing home care and personal care services,
are of less relevance to our study because we focus on com-
munity-dwelling Veterans. Considering the median age in
our cohort was 74 to 75 years, we anticipate that a negligible
proportion may also have had coverage through a private
health insurance plan.
Conclusions
Given the unanticipated lack of association between reliance
on VHA ambulatory care services and PHRs across states,
federal and state officials may want to reconsider how best to
allocate resources to ensure access to and quality of ambula-
tory care services for Veterans. Examining the totality of
health care utilization utilized by veterans may suggest new
approaches.
