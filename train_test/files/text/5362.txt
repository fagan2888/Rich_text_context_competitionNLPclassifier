Abstract
Objective: To explore the possible correlation between uric acid levels and leukoaraiosis (LA).
Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients who presented with some neurological
discomfort (e.g. dizziness, headache, mild cognitive impairment). Potential demographic and clinical
risk factors associated with LA, including sex, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol
consumption, dyslipidaemia, plasma fibrinogen, D-dimer, uric acid, and homocysteine, were
investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Results: A total of 268 patients were enrolled in the study and divided into the LA group (n ¼ 164)
and the non-LA group (n ¼ 104). Compared with the non-LA group, uric acid was significantly
higher in the LA group (mean Æ SD: 356.49 Æ 121.85 mmol/l versus 289.96 Æ 102.98 mmol/l).
Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that uric acid was an independent risk factor for
LA (odds ratio 1.285; 95% confidence interval 1.062, 1.556).
Conclusion: Hyperuricaemia was an independent risk factor for leukoaraiosis in Chinese patients.

Introduction
Leukoaraiosis (LA), also known as white
matter hyperintensities, is a spot or patch of
white matter lesions around the ventricles
and subcortex (semioval centre).1 LA is not
only associated with affective disorder and
cognitive impairment in the elderly,2 it is
also associated with the incidence, recur-
rence and prognosis of stroke.2­4 A clearer
understanding of the risk factors associated
with the development of LA is required
so that treatment can be initiated as early
as possible in order to reduce clinical

symptoms and subsequent serious compli-
cations. Uric acid is a metabolic end product
of endogenous and exogenous purine
metabolism.5 With an improvement in
living standards and a change in diet com-
position, the levels of uric acid and the
prevalence of hyperuricaemia can increase.6
According a survey undertaken in China,
10% of the total population has hyperur-
icaemia, which accounts for around 120
million people.7 The correlation between
uric acid and acute ischaemic stroke is still
disputed.8,9 Few studies exist that have
investigated the correlation between uric
acid and acute ischaemic stroke.6 The aim
of this present study was to investigate the
possible correlation between uric acid levels
and LA in a Chinese population.
Patients and methods
Study patients
This cross-sectional study consecutively
enrolled patients who presented with some
neurological discomfort (e.g. dizziness, head-
ache, mild cognitive impairment) at the fol-
lowing three hospitals between May 2013
and May 2014: Department of Neurology,
Quanzhou First Hospital, Quanzhou, Fujian
Province, China; Department of Neurology,
Hospital of Jinjiang City, Jinjiang, Fujian
Province, China; and Department of
Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of
Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou,
Fujian Province, China. The inclusion cri-
teria were as follows: (i) aged 40­80 years; (ii)
no cerebral haemorrhage, intracranial mass,
subarachnoid haemorrhage, epidural haema-
toma and subdural haematoma as confirmed
by computed tomography (CT) scans of the
head; (iii) able to undergo magnetic reson-
ance imaging (MRI) examination; and (iv)
no disorders of consciousness. The exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: (i) acute cere-
bral infarction; (ii) haemorrhagic stroke,
brain tumour, meningitis, and intracranial
aneurysm; (iii) cerebral trauma, atrial fibril-
lation, hepatic, kidney and cardiac failure,
severe infection, malignant disease, systemic
lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis
(MS) and genetic disease; (iv) a history of
carbon monoxide, food or drug poisoning;
(v) patients who cannot take care
themselves; (vi) a score on the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment scale < 26;10 (vii)
hypoattenuated substantia alba caused
by MS, intracranial infection, radiation
encephalopathy, carbon monoxide poison-
ing, Alzheimer's disease, brain trauma,
normal hydrocephalus, connective tis-
sue disease, hypotension (blood
pressure < 90/60 mmHg), postural hypoten-
sion, anaemia, demyelinating diseases and
adrenoleukodystrophy.
The study was approved by the Ethics
Committees of: Quanzhou First Hospital,
Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China;
Hospital of Jinjiang City, Jinjiang, Fujian
Province, China; and Second Affiliated
Hospital of Fujian Medical University,
Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China (regis-
tration numbers: QZSYLL382, JJSYY648,
FYDFSEY362). Patients or their family
members provided written informed
consent.
Magnetic resonance imaging
All patients underwent an MRI examin-
ation, including axial T1-weighted images,
T2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inver-
sion recovery images and diffusion-weighted
images using a GYROSCAN ACS-NT
scanner (magnetic field intensity was 1.5 T,
slice thickness 5 mm, interslice gap 0.5 mm;
Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).
All images were read by two neuroimaging
experts (Y.H.H. and R.W.C.).
Leukoaraiosis was diagnosed according to
previously published criteria.1 All patients
examined by MRI were subdivided into an
LA group and a non-LA group.

Clinical data collection
When the patients attended the hospital,
their complete medical history was taken.
The routine clinical data from all patients
enrolled in the study, including sex, age,
smoking status, alcohol consumption,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary
artery disease (CAD), fasting blood glucose,
globulin, albumin, cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
triglycerides, apolipoprotein-A, apolipopro-
tein-B, homocysteine, platelet count, haem-
atocrit, fibrinogen, D-dimer and uric acid
were collected from the hospital databases
using a unified questionnaire. The biochem-
ical and haematological parameters were
analysed using a Beckman AU680
Chemistry System and a Beckman LH 780
haematology analyser according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
The presence of atherosclerotic risk fac-
tors was standardized as follows: (i) hyper-
tension was recorded when systolic blood
pressure ! 140 mmHg and/or diastolic
blood pressure ! 90 mmHg more than three
times during the 7 days after a stroke on
different days or a history of physician-
diagnosed hypertension and/or taking
antihypertensive medication; (ii) diabetes
mellitus was recorded when there were
symptoms (e.g. excessive thirst, frequent or
increased urination, especially at night;
excessive hunger; fatigue; blurred vision;
sores or cuts that won't heal; and
weight loss) of diabetes plus a random
blood glucose !11.1 mmol/l, or when there
were symptoms of diabetes plus a fasting
blood glucose !7.0 mmol/l, or when there
were symptoms of diabetes plus a blood
glucose !11.1 mmol/l at 2 h in an oral
glucose tolerance test, or a history of dia-
betes mellitus; (iii) CAD when there was a
history of CAD, or CT angiography or
digital subtraction angiography evidence of
coronary artery stenosis degree !50%,
or typical angina pectoris or myocardial
ischaemic changes proven by electrocardio-
gram; (iv) a history of smoking was con-
sidered if >10 cigarettes had been smoked
per day for >5 years; (v) a history of alcohol
consumption was considered if the patient
had been drinking >100 g per day for >5
years.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 17.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Data are presented as
mean Æ SD, mean Æ SE or n of patients
(%) as appropriate. Comparisons across
groups were examined using the 2-test for
categorical variables and Student's t-test or
one-way analysis of variance followed by the
Tukey's b test for multiple comparisons of
continuous variables. A multivariate logistic
regression analysis was performed to find
the independent predictor of LA. A P-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Of the 268 patients who were enrolled in the
study, the 164 patients with LA (LA group)
had a mean Æ SD age of 65.43 Æ 9.56 years
(range 45­80 years) and 98 were male. The
104 patients without LA (non-LA group)
had a mean Æ SD age of 52.77 Æ 7.05 years
(range 40­65 years) and 32 were male.
Table 1 presents the demographic and clin-
ical characteristics of the two groups. A total
of 124 patients had hypertension, 36 had
diabetes mellitus, 24 had CAD, 50 had a
history of smoking, and 28 had a history of
alcohol consumption.
Univariate analysis demonstrated that
there were significant differences between
the LA and non-LA groups in terms of uric

blood glucose (P ¼ 0.026), HDL-C
(P ¼ 0.049) and LDL-C (P ¼ 0.006), but
other characteristics were not significantly
different (Table 1).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
used LA as the dependent variable with the
significantly different characteristics from
the univariate analysis as the independent
variables in order to identify the risk factors
for LA. The multivariate logistic regression
analysis demonstrated that uric acid, homo-
cysteine, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus
and albumin were independently associated
with the presence of LA (Table 2).
Discussion
It is widely acknowledged that LA is one
type of presentation of small cerebrovascu-
lar disease.11 The continuous development
and wide application of neuroimaging has
resulted in ever increasing rates of detection

of LA, which has drawn greater attention
from neurologists.2 Uric acid is the meta-
bolic end product of endogenous and
exogenous purine metabolism, which are
the major components of RNA and
DNA.5 The association between uric acid
and acute stroke is still disputed,8,9 while
studies of the relationship between uric acid
and LA are limited.6 A clearer understand-
ing of the risk factors associated with the
development of LA is required so that
treatment can be initiated as early as pos-
sible in order to reduce clinical symptoms
and subsequent serious complications.
Therefore, it is important to investigate the
possible association between uric acid levels
and the presence of LA.
This present study found that hyperten-
sion, age, hyperhomocysteinaemia, diabetes
mellitus and hyperalbuminaemia were inde-
pendent risk factors for LA, findings that
were consistent with the results of previous
studies.12­16 These findings suggest that
patients with the risk factors described
above should be monitored carefully and
offered prophylactic treatment.
In this present study, hyperuricaemia was
a risk factor for LA in both the univariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Few studies have reported on the relation-
ship between uric acid and LA.6 Large
prospective studies have demonstrated
that hyperuricaemia was an independent
risk factor of cerebral-cardiovascular
diseases.17,18 Hyperuricaemia can also inter-
fere with the metabolism of lipids and
glucose.15,19 The pathogenesis of hyperur-
icaemia-promoting LA appears to be con-
sistent with stroke: (i) uric acid promotes
LDL-C oxidation and lipid peroxidation,
induces vascular endothelial cell dysfunc-
tion, and the oxygen free radicals that are
created cause an inflammatory reaction of
the vascular wall that promotes atheroscler-
osis; (ii) the inflammatory reaction caused
by uric acid crystals activates platelet func-
tion, which increases platelet adhesion and
starts the coagulation cascade, which ultim-
ately promotes thrombosis; (iii) uric acid
causes endothelial dysfunction, promotes
the formation of local oxidizing agents and
the reaction of inflammatory mediators such
as monocyte chemoattractant protein,
nuclear factor-kB, interleukin (IL)-1b,
IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-a.20­23
In this present study, sex, fibrinogen,
HDL-C, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose,
smoking and alcohol consumption were
risk factors for LA in the univariate ana-
lyses, but were not significant in the multi-
variate logistic regression analyses. This
result might have been caused by the small
sample size and the cross-sectional nature of
the study. The results suggest that larger
prospective studies are needed to confirm
these preliminary findings.
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, it was a cross-sectional study.

Secondly, the data were obtained from a
limited geographical area with a small
sample size. Thirdly, other risk factors for
LA may exist that were not examined in this
present study.
In conclusion, this present study identi-
fied hyperuricaemia as a risk factor for LA
in Chinese patients.
