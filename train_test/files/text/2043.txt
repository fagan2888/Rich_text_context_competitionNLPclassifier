Background--Whereas increased carbohydrate and sugar consumption has been associated with higher cardiovascular
disease risk among adults, little is known about the impact of high consumption of added sugars (caloric sweeteners)
among US adolescents.
Methods and Results--In a cross-sectional study of 2157 US adolescents in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, dietary data from one 24-hour recall were merged with added sugar content data from
the US Department of Agriculture MyPyramid Equivalents databases. Measures of cardiovascular disease risk were
estimated by added sugar consumption level (10%, 10 to 15%, 15 to 20%, 20 to 25%, 25 to 30%, and 30%
of total energy). Multivariable means were weighted to be representative of US adolescents and variances adjusted for
the complex sampling methods. Daily consumption of added sugars averaged 21.4% of total energy. Added sugars
intake was inversely correlated with mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mmol/L) which were 1.40 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.36 to 1.44) among the lowest consumers and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.33) among the highest
(P trend 0.001). Added sugars were positively correlated with low-density lipoproteins (P trend 0.01) and geometric
mean triglycerides (P trend 0.05). Among the lowest and highest consumers, respectively, low-density lipoproteins
(mmol/L) were 2.24 (95% CI 2.12 to 2.37) and 2.44 (95% CI 2.34 to 2.53), and triglycerides (mmol/L) were 0.81 (95%
CI 0.74, 0.88) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.96). Among those overweight/obese (85th percentile body-mass-index),
added sugars were positively correlated with the homeostasis model assessment (P linear trend 0.004).
Conclusion--Consumption of added sugars among US adolescents is positively associated with multiple measures known
to increase cardiovascular disease risk. (Circulation. 2011;123:249-257.)

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality among US adults. Whereas
atherosclerosis and CVD occur later in life, their risk factors,
including lipid disorders,1 diabetes mellitus,2 and obesity are
increasingly identified among adolescents and even children.
Currently 32% of US children and adolescents aged 2 to 18
years are overweight or obese.3 Though CVD among children
is rare, an increase in risk factors at younger ages and their
apparent tendency to track into adulthood highlights the need
for early and effective prevention efforts.4­6
Lifestyle changes, including dietary change, have long been a
central focus of efforts to reduce CVD risk. Since the 1950s
Americans have been advised to reduce their consumption of
fats and cholesterol and replace them with complex carbohy-
drates.7 It appears that, in part, Americans have followed this
advice. But whereas food disappearance data suggest that fat
consumption has decreased, it is refined rather than complex
carbohydrates that have increased. Although the overall health
impact of this trend is unclear, several studies have shown a
positive correlation between the consumption of carbohydrates,
particularly some sugars, and the presence of CVD risk fac-
tors.8­10 A recent longitudinal study among women demon-
strated that the incidence of CVD was increased among higher
consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages,11 the largest contrib-
utor of added sugars in the US diet.12 Studies comparing the
impact of different sugars have demonstrated that the monosac-
charide fructose, but not glucose, raises triglyceride levels and
lowers high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, suggesting that
the metabolic impact may differ substantially by sugar type.10,13

tion. Consumption of these sugars has increased substantially
in recent decades. Sugars used to sweeten soft drinks have
become the largest single source of calories in the US diet.14
In 1994 to 1996, Americans 2 years of age obtained nearly
16% of their total energy from added sugars; adolescents, the
highest consumers, obtained 20% of their energy from
these sugars.15 Today in the US, the most commonly con-
sumed added sugars are refined beet or cane sugar (sucrose)
and high fructose corn syrup,16 both of which contribute
fructose and glucose in approximately equal amounts to the
diet. Added sugars are estimated to contribute 74% to 80% of
the dietary fructose consumed.17,18
Given the high consumption of added sugars among
adolescents and the potential for long-term health risks
associated with early diet, it is important to understand the
impact of this dietary trend. The purpose of our study was to
determine if there is an association between the consumption
of added sugars and indicators of CVD risk among US
adolescents and to determine if body weight modifies this
association.
Methods
Study Design and Subjects
Data for our study come from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a sequential series of
cross-sectional surveys of the US civilian noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation designed to obtain nationally representative estimates on diet
and health indicators. A description of the complex sampling
methodology is described elsewhere.19 The study sample consists of
adolescents ages 12 to18 year living in the US between 1999 and
2004 (n2485) who were randomly selected to provide a fasting
blood sample for NHANES 1999 to 2000, NHANES 2001 to 2002,
or NHANES 2003 to 2004. Excluded from the sample (in order of
exclusion) were those with unreliable20 or implausible (600 or
4500 kcal/d) dietary data (n159), those pregnant (n33), those
with extreme triglyceride levels (300 mg/dL; n23), those with
previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (n9), and those with miss-
ing covariate data (n104). After exclusions, the total sample for
this study included 2157 adolescents. Study protocols for NHANES
1999 to 2004 were approved by the institutional review board at the
National Center for Health Statistics.21 Signed informed consent was
obtained from all participants and their parent/guardian.
Added Sugars and Other Dietary Intake
In NHANES 1999 to 2000 and NHANES 2001 to 2002, one 24-hour
dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake from all participants.
In NHANES 2003 to 2004, a second 24-hour recall was collected by
phone from all respondents. For consistency, we used only the first
dietary recall to assess intake for all participants in the primary
analysis. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the
mean added sugars intake for each of the respondents in NHANES
2003 to 2004. Nutrient content of the foods consumed was deter-
mined by NHANES using the Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies, which uses food composition data from the US
Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard
Reference.22 Because the Standard Reference database does not
include information on the added sugar content of many foods, we
merged the individual food files from NHANES with the most
recently released MyPyramid Equivalents database (MPED) files,
those for 1999 to 2000, 2001 to 2002, and 2003 to 2004.23 The
MPED database provides standard serving size information for the
major food categories found on the US Department of Agriculture
Food Guide Pyramid (grains, meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and
beans), as well as for added sugars and discretionary fats. A
description of the MPED database24 and the methods used to
calculate the sugar content of foods can be found elsewhere.25
To determine the amount of added sugars consumed in each food
and beverage, we multiplied the total amount consumed in grams (as
provided in the NHANES database) by the amount of added sugars
in each of these foods (teaspoons/100 g; as provided in the MPED
database). The results for each food consumed were summed to
obtain the total added sugars intake in teaspoons and converted to
grams by multiplying by 4.2 g/teaspoon.26 This result was multiplied
by 4 kcal to obtain the total energy from added sugars. Finally, the
total energy from added sugars (kcal) was divided by total energy
intake (kcal/d) to obtain the percentage of total energy from added
sugars.
Indicators of CVD Risk
Biological indicators known to be associated with CVD1,27,28 were
measured in NHANES using standardized laboratory procedures that
have been described elsewhere.29 Measured lipids include fasting
serum or plasma: HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and
triglycerides. Measured indicators of glucose metabolism include
fasting insulin and glucose. Anthropometric measures (height,
weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure were measured
by trained interviewers using standardized equipment and protocols.
Body-mass-index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and
height as kg/m2, and BMI was converted to age- and sex-
standardized percentiles and z-scores on the basis of Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention 2000 growth charts.30
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were calculated using
the Friedewald formula: LDL cholesterol (mmol/L)TCHDL
cholesteroltriglycerides/2.19.31 The homeostasis model assess-
ment (HOMA-IR) is an estimate of insulin resistance derived
from fasting glucose and insulin levels, with higher levels
representing greater degrees of insulin resistance.32 HOMA-IR
was calculated using the formula developed by Mathews et al:
fasting insulin (pmol/L)fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.33
Covariates
Variables previously shown to be associated with carbohydrate
intake and with any of the CVD risk indicators specified above were
included as covariates. These covariates include: measured waist
circumference and BMI, as well as self-reported demographic data
(participant's age [in years], sex, income, and race/ethnicity [%
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other]).
Given the small sample size, Mexican-American and other Hispanic
were combined into a single category entitled "Hispanic" for
analyses. Because education, when compared to income and occu-
pation, has been shown to be the only measure of socioeconomic
status significantly associated with measures of CVD risk,34 we
included educational level of lease or mortgage holding parent/
guardian (greater than high-school [yes or no]) in our models.
Because of the high number of missing values (7.5% of sample), we
elected to not include income as a second measure of socioeconomic
status. As a measure of physical activity, respondents were asked to
provide a list all of the moderate or vigorous leisure activities they
engaged in over the previous month and to provide the frequency and
the usual duration of these activities. MET (metabolic equivalent)
minutes were then calculated as the sum of the following for each
reported activity: duration in minutesfrequencymetabolic equiva-
lent intensity level (MET score).
The values for dietary covariates were determined using data from
one 24-hour dietary recall and included total energy intake and the
total energy-adjusted nutrient residuals for fiber, other carbohydrates
(excluding added sugars and fiber), saturated fats (SFAs), polyun-
saturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and monounsaturated fatty acids
(MUFAs), proteins, fiber, sodium, and cholesterol. These nutrient
residuals were calculated using linear regression models with total
calorie intake as the predictor and the absolute intake of each nutrient
of interest (in grams) as the outcome in order to separate the nutrient
effect from that of the calories consumed.35

sampling methods used in NHANES were applied. Sample weights
for the 6 years of data that reflect the probability of selection,
nonresponse, and poststratification adjustments were calculated as
follows: 2/3wtsaf4yr (fasting sample weight for NHANES 1999 to
2002) and 1/3wtsaf2yr (fasting sample weight for NHANES 2003 to
2004)19 and used to ensure that results were representative of the US
population. To ensure sufficiently large sample sizes in each group,
respondents were grouped into 6 groups of approximately equal size
by the percentage of their total energy intake from added sugars: 0%
to 10%, 10% to 15%, 15% to 20%, 20% to 25%, 25% to
30%, and 30%. All of the P values were 2-sided. A P value 0.05
was considered statistically significant for main effects.
Percentages, means, and standard error (SE) of key variables were
calculated to describe the sample at each level of added sugars
intake. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship
between intake of added sugars and our outcome measures while
controlling for the effect of potentially confounding variables. As the
distribution of triglycerides was skewed, the values in the linear
regression models were log transformed, and geometric means are
presented. Estimate statements in the regression models were used to
determine the adjusted mean of each of the measures of CVD risk for
each level of added sugar intake.36 Contrasts were used to specify
linear tests among the levels of added sugars consumption and to
compare each group of respondents to the referent group (10% of
total energy from added sugars) for each of the outcomes of
interest.36 2 tests were used to test differences in categorical
variables and Wald f-tests were used for continuous variables.
To identify the macronutrients to be included in our regression
models, we first performed bivariate analyses to assess the associa-
tion between the intake of total fat and the intake of protein with each
of our outcomes. The energy-adjusted residuals for protein but not
fat were found to be associated with measures of dysglycemia
(fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR), blood pressure, and
adiposity (BMI and waist circumference). Therefore, we included
protein but not fat intake as a covariate in these models. Because we
also controlled for total energy intake and intake of carbohydrates
(other than added sugars), results obtained using these models can be
interpreted as the effect of replacing fat in the diet (the macronutrient
left out of the models) with added sugars.35 In contrast, the energy
adjusted residuals for the intake of PUFAs, MUFAs, and SFAs, but
not proteins, were each found, in bivariate analyses, to be associated
with blood lipid measures (HDL, LDL, TC, and triglycerides).
Therefore, we included the intake of each of these dietary fats, but
not protein, in the models with lipid measures as the outcome. The
results of these models can be interpreted at the effect of replacing
protein in the diet with added sugars.
Because of problems with multicollinearity in models that in-
cluded both BMI and waist circumference, waist circumference was
dropped from the regression models. Given that postprandial li-
poprotein37 and insulin responses38 have been shown to differ by
body weight, race, and sex, we tested for the presence of effect
modification between level of added sugars intake and each of these
variables by including a multiplicative term for each in the models.
Body weight was dichotomized as not overweight (85th percentile
BMI; n1340) and overweight (85th percentile BMI; n817).39 A
P value of 0.10 was considered significant.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the association
between intake of added sugars and HDL and HOMA-IR levels
using the absolute intake of added sugar (in grams) as the exposure
rather than the proportion of total energy from added sugars. To do
this we grouped all respondents into 6 groups of equal size according
to the grams of added sugars consumed. In addition, to determine if
our results were consistent when data from two 24-hour recalls were
used, we repeated our analysis using a smaller (30%) subsample of
respondents from whom a second 24-hour dietary recall had been
collected. In these analyses, the mean intake of added sugars
(percentage total energy) and of other dietary covariates was used for
each respondent together with the same nondietary covariates de-
scribed for the models above.
Results
A description of the study sample by level of added sugars is
provided in Table 1. No significant differences were seen
between level of added sugars consumed and demographic
factors, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty, or educa-
tional level. Similarly, no association was seen between the
amount of added sugars consumed and physical activity or
total energy intake.
Daily consumption of added sugars averaged 118.9 g (28.3
tsp or 476 calories) daily. This represents 21.4% (95%
confidence interval [CI] 20.5% to 22.2%) of total daily
caloric intake (total energy; not shown). There was no
significant difference in consumption across racial/ethnic
groups. The increased trend in percentage total energy from
carbohydrates with higher intake of added sugars was signif-
icant (P linear trend 0.0001), as was the increased trend in
the absolute intake of carbohydrates (P linear trend 0.0001
(Table 1). Intake of added sugars was negatively correlated
with both the percentage total energy and the absolute intake
(g) of total fats, SFAs, PUFAs, MUFAs, and protein (P linear
trend 0.0001 for all). Fiber, cholesterol, and sodium intakes
were also negatively correlated with intake of added sugars
(P linear trend 0.0001, 0.0003, and 0.0001, respectively).
In fully adjusted linear regression models we found that
neither body weight, race/ethnicity, nor sex modified the
association between added sugar intake and lipid measures.
Lipid levels were correlated with intake of added sugars
(Table 2). HDL levels were lower among those who con-
sumed more added sugars (P linear trend 0.001). Among
the highest consumers (30% total energy), HDLs were
1.28 mmol/L (95% CI 1.23 to 1.33; 49.5 mg/dL) compared
with 1.40 mmol/L (95% CI 1.36 to 1.44; 54.0 mg/dL) among
the lowest consumers (10% total energy), a difference of
9% (P0.001; Figure 1). In contrast, LDL and geometric
mean triglyceride levels were higher among those consuming
higher levels of added sugars (P linear trend 0.01 and 0.05,
respectively; Table 2). Among the highest compared to the
lowest consumers, adjusted LDL levels were 2.44 mmol/L
(95% CI 2.34 to 2.53; 94.3 mg/dL) and 2.24 mmol/L (95% CI
2.12 to 2.37; 86.7 mg/dL), and geometric mean triglyceride
levels were 0.89 mmol/L (95% CI 0.83 to 0.96; 79.0 mg/dL)
and 0.81 mmol/L (95% CI 0.74 to 0.88; 71.7 mg/dL),
respectively. This represents a difference between lowest and
highest consumers of 9% in LDL levels (P0.08) and 10%
in triglyceride levels (P0.07). There was no significant
trend in TC with higher intake of added sugars (P linear
trend0.16).
Because the effect of added sugars intake was shown to be
modified by body weight (but not by race/ethnicity or sex) in
models with HOMA-IR, insulin, glucose, systolic blood
pressure, and waist circumference as the outcomes (P inter-
action 0.09 for glucose and 0.003 for all other outcomes),
the analyses of these measures were stratified by weight
status. We found that the intake of added sugars and
HOMA-IR measures were positively correlated among over-
weight adolescents (P linear trend 0.004) but not among
those who were normal weight (P linear trend 0.41; Figure
2). Adjusted mean HOMA-IR among overweight adolescents
with the highest consumption was 4.61 (95% CI 4.08 to 5.13)

compared with 3.49 (95% CI 3.02 to 3.95) among the lowest
consumers, a difference of 32% (Table 2). A similar differ-
ence was observed with fasting insulin levels. No significant
association was observed between consumption of added
sugars and fasting glucose. Similarly, there were no signifi-
cant trends in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, waist
circumference, or BMI (among either the overweight or not
overweight) with increased intake of added sugars (Table 2).
We repeated the analyses of the associations between
intake of added sugars and mean HDL and HOMA-IR levels
with respondents divided into 6 equally-sized groups accord-
ing to their absolute daily intake of added sugars (0 to 49.5,

consumption relative to their total energy intake. The results
were very similar to those obtained in the primary analysis.
HDLs were 1.19 mmol/L (95% CI 1.10 to 1.28) among the
highest consumers and 1.40 mmol/L (95% CI 1.31 to 1.49)
among the lowest (P linear trend 0.004). HOMA-IRs
among those who were overweight were 4.85 (95% CI 3.99 to
5.72) among the highest consumers and 3.39 (95% CI 2.84 to
3.94) among the lowest (P linear trend0.02).
When the analysis was repeated using the mean intake
obtained from the smaller subsample of respondents who
provided two 24-hour dietary recalls (those participating in
NHANES 2003 to 2004; n646), point estimates and trends
for HDL and HOMA-IR were again similar to those obtained
in the primary analyses. Among the highest versus lowest
added sugar consumers (percentage total energy), HDLs were
1.34 mmol/L (95% CI 1.24 to 1.44) and 1.43 mmol/L (95%
CI 1.34 to 1.53), respectively (P linear trend 0.009), and
HOMA-IRs among the overweight/obese were 4.97 (95% CI
3.19 to 6.74) and 3.19 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.95), respectively
(P linear trend 0.05).
Discussion
In 1986, the Sugars Task Force of the US Food and Drug
Administration published a review of the research then
available and concluded that there was no conclusive evi-
dence of an association between sugar consumption and CVD
or its risk factors.40 Since then, the results of several new
epidemiological studies and short- and long-term experimen-

tal studies have provided more evidence linking the intake of
carbohydrates41,42 and sugars10,11,42,43 (particularly fruc-
tose10,44,45) and increased risk of CVD. And importantly,
consumption of added sugars has risen substantially since the
research reviewed in the Sugar Task Force report was done.
The Task Force report estimated that consumption of added
sugars among adolescents was 62 to 84 g in 1977 to 1978.
The results of our study indicate that by 1999 to 2004
consumption among this group had risen to 119 g, an increase
of 42% to 92%.
Our results demonstrate that intake of added sugars is
positively associated with known cardiovascular risk factors
when controlling for other characteristics. We found in-
creased dyslipidemia (lower HDLs and higher LDLs and
triglyceride levels) among adolescents, regardless of body
size, and increased insulin resistance (higher fasting insulin
and HOMA-IR measures) among those overweight or obese
with higher intake of added sugars. Several mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the dysmetabolic effects of carbo-
hydrates and specifically sugars. These include (1) the insulin
response to the metabolism of high­glycemic index foods,
such as processed sugars, that cause a rapid postprandial rise
and fall in glucose levels; (2) the increased de novo lipogen-
esis that results when high levels of fructose are metabolized
by the liver; and (3) increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis
combined with increased secretion and/or decreased clear-
ance of very-low-density lipoproteins.46 Modification of the
effect of added sugars on measures of glucose metabolism by
weight status could be explained by the decreased insulin
sensitivity known to result from increased adiposity.38
Clearly, added sugars play a significant role in the US diet.
They increase the desirability of foods by increasing sweet-
ness. They also contribute substantially to energy intake
without contributing other important nutrients to the diet.47
Existing guidelines for limiting the consumption of added
sugars vary widely. The Institute of Medicine suggests a limit
of 25% of total energy from added sugars in order to ensure
adequate intake of important nutrients,48 the World Health
Organization advises limiting added sugars to 10% total
energy to prevent dental caries, obesity, and chronic disease49
and recently released recommendations from the American
Heart Association advise that daily intake of added sugars
should be limited to 100 calories daily for women and 150
calories for men46 (5% of total energy) as a strategy for
preventing heart disease. The 2005 US Dietary Guidelines for
Americans encourage consumers to "choose and prepare
foods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric
sweeteners"47 but do not specify an upper limit. Although our
results support the need for dietary guidelines that encourage
lower intake of added sugars, they also highlight the need for
a comprehensive examination of the evidence on the effect of
added sugars on cardiovascular and other chronic disease risks.

Our study has several important strengths. First, we have
used nationally representative data, and, to our knowledge,
this is the first study to assess the association between added
sugars and indicators of CVD risk among US adolescents.
Second, we were able to control for several important
confounding variables, including BMI, socioeconomic status,
and physical activity. Also, because we had complete 24-hour
dietary recall data on all participants, we were able to control
for total energy intake, the intake of specific fats, and other
dietary factors. Availability of a second 24-hour dietary recall
in a subsample of respondents enabled us to do a sensitivity
analysis using the mean of 2 days intake of added sugars.
Finally, the use of trained staff following standardized pro-
tocols to measure height and weight and collect laboratory
and interview data increases the accuracy and validity of the
data collected.
Our study is also subject to some limitations. Cross-
sectional studies such as ours are limited by the fact that
exposures and outcomes are measured at the same time. As a
result, our data can be used only to assess associations. They
cannot be used to assess the direction or temporarily of these
associations or to determine causality. Also, as only a single
24-hour dietary recall was used to assess diet, the dietary
intake data may not represent the usual diet of respondents.
Our inability to account for within person day-to-day vari-
ability may have resulted in some misclassification of the
intake of added sugars, but we expect that this would be
random.50 In addition, when we evaluated those with 2
available 24-hour recalls, key findings remained consistent.
Whereas underreporting of certain foods high in sugars,
such as sodas and sweets, may occur more frequently among
those who underreport total energy,51 such as those over-
weight or obese52 who are also at increased risk of diabetes
mellitus and dyslipidemia, systematic misclassification of this
type would be expected to bias our findings toward the null.
In addition, as no information on the validity of the process
used to estimate added sugar content data in the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture MPED database is available, there could
be some misclassification of our exposure variable. Similarly,
because the instruments used to assess important covariates
such as physical activity have not been validated in this
population, residual confounding could also be present.
In conclusion, higher consumption of added sugars among
US adolescents is associated with several important CVD risk
factors. Though long-term trials to study the effect of reduc-
ing the consumption of added sugars are needed, the results of
this study suggest that future risk of CVD may be reduced by
minimizing consumption of added sugars among adolescents.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Consumption of added sugars (caloric sweeteners), which contribute calories but no other nutrients to the diet, are the
source of more than one fifth of the calories consumed by US adolescents. The results of our study show that higher
consumption of these sugars is associated with blood lipid levels that may place adolescents at increased risk of future
cardiovascular disease. We also found that the risks associated with added sugar consumption may be higher among
overweight or obese adolescents because higher consumption among this group was also associated with increased insulin
resistance. Our findings highlight the prominence of added sugars in the diets of adolescents and suggest that reducing this
consumption could be a strategy for modifying cardiovascular disease risk factors and helping to prevent cardiovascular
disease. The associations demonstrated in our cross-sectional study point to the need for controlled trials to determine if
reducing consumption of added sugars can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors in adolescents and prevent future
disease.
