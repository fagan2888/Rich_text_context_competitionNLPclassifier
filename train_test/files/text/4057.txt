During a Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing in May
2007, at a time when the United States was in the middle of
the war in Iraq, U.S. Representative David Scott asked a
question central to public diplomacy efforts since the found-
ing of the country, "How do we win the hearts and minds of
foreign peoples so that we may foster productive relation-
ships with them and their governments to mutual benefit?"
(Scott, 2007, p. 4). The broad question is difficult to answer,
especially during times of regional conflict, when the United
States seeks to maintain friendly relationships with countries
such as the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and limit damage
in other countries more hostile to the United States, such as
Iraq. The question also assumes that people can be influ-
enced and are capable of seeing various sides of an issue. It
also very clearly ignores the role that culture plays in any
type of conflict and the difficulties that emerge when the val-
ues of one culture clash with the values of another. Social
identity theory may help explain the impact of cultural dif-
ferences in such conflict situations, as people in the Middle
East strongly identify with their culture. Social identity the-
ory posits that identification with a group or culture often
includes a favorable bias toward one's own group and rejec-
tion of the other group (Tajfel, 1978).
Over the years, the media, in various forms, have played
a pivotal role, often in times of conflict, in the attempt by the
U.S. government to win the hearts and minds of those "for-
eign peoples" and to shape public opinion to support foreign
policy. This rationale led to the development of Alhurra
Television, a satellite network designed to reach countries
throughout the Middle East with news and information from
a U.S. government perspective. Alhurra is an Arabic term for
"The Free One" and offers news discussion programs, current
affairs, and a variety of feature programming. Alhurra is
intended to "give its audience insights into life inAmerica and
the American system of government" (Blaya, 2007, p. 38).
Using social identity as a basis for understanding the role
media play in this international communication environ-
ment, this current research adds to the limited academic dis-
course on Alhurra and seeks to shed some light on whom
Alhurra is reaching, specifically by developing a model that
predicts cultural attributes of viewers and nonviewers. The
challenges faced at the beginning of U.S. international
broadcasting efforts were much the same as those faced by
entities like Alhurra today. As Senator Richard Lugar noted
in a Senate report on current U.S. international broadcasting
efforts,
In addition to multiple commercial and other foreign
government broadcasters competing with U.S. efforts,
with different forms of media have also come different

A Clash of Cultures: Reaching Hostile
AudiencesThrough International
Broadcasting

Abstract
This study examines U.S. international broadcasting efforts through the Office of War Information and Voice of America to
provide a philosophy and foundation for the use of AlhurraTelevision.This station was launched during the Iraq war to reach
audiences and influence public policy in the Middle East.This study found high percentages of Alhurra viewing classification
using the discriminant function, suggesting that the combination of key cultural indicator variables is a sound predictor
of viewing this news source. Thus, this study validates the premise of U.S. policy as it confirms the challenges faced by
international broadcasting 70 years ago and today--the role key cultural indicators play when these viewers decide to turn
to or away from Alhurra for news and other information. Demographic, media usage, and attitudinal variables were used to
test a model developed to understand cultural differences for prediction of Alhurra viewing or nonviewing.

methods of repressing it. Some nations completely
block U.S. broadcasting efforts by jamming our radio
broadcasts, satellite TV or Internet programming,
while others imprison, torture, or kill both local and
international journalists. (Committee on Foreign
Relations, 2010, p. 3)
The technical and programmatic problems faced by U.S.
international broadcasters are not new. To put these issues
into perspective, it is important to look back at the founding
of U.S. international broadcasting.
U.S. government efforts to reach audiences through
international broadcasting began with George Creel and the
Committee on Public Information. His committee used
various propaganda techniques to influence countries
around the world and was followed in World War II by the
Office of War Information (OWI). From its creation as a
tool of public diplomacy, the OWI's mission was
undermining morale in enemy countries; keeping alive
the hope of liberation in enemy occupied territories;
winning the moral support of people in neutral coun-
tries; and countering enemy propaganda, promoting
morale, and fostering better understanding of the
United States in Allied nations. (Davison, 1963, p. 29)
In looking back on that time, Senator Richard Lugar
notes,
[The U.S.] has always addressed two audiences. One
audience views the United States positively, as a
democracy based on the free flow of information, the
freedom of expression, civic discourse and active
citizen participation in government. This group will
more often than not be supportive of U.S. actions and
initiatives, or at least give us the benefit of the doubt.
Members of the second group believe that these
strengths are, instead, weaknesses and are predis-
posed to assume the worst about America; they
reject--or worse, attack--us as a result. Successful
Public Diplomacy (PD) keeps the first group engaged
and increases its numbers while reducing the size and
impact of the second. (Committee on Foreign
Relations, 2010, p. 5)
Reaching two diverse audiences is a challenge. In particu-
lar, reaching the second category of audience described by
Senator Lugar--those who think the worst about America--
could be described as being hostile to American sources of
news information. The OWI used a simple philosophy to
undergird its efforts to reach people overseas: "that simple
truth, offered in a friendly spirit, is the best of all possible
propaganda" (Barnes, 1943, p. 43).
Operating under that philosophy, the OWI began produc-
ing radio programs in January 1942, when the Office of the
Coordinator of Information produced its first broadcasts for
retransmission in London over the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC). Although it started later than other
countries (the Netherlands, Russia, and Britain, for exam-
ple, had been broadcasting for almost 20 years), the United
States started to catch up quickly. On February 1, 1942,
seven programs were produced each week, but a year later
2,682 programs were produced each week (Carlton, 1943).
Within a year of starting operations, OWI was transmitting
"from the United States continuously--twenty-four hours a
day to Europe and Africa alone--programs in twenty-four
different languages, over twenty-one short wave transmit-
ters" (Carlton, 1943, p. 48). OWI,
disseminated to literally every country of the world,
save the Americas, more than two million words and
more than 200,000 pictures which regularly found
their way into more than 3,500 publications and
spread their message through uncounted leaflets,
through radio broadcasts abroad, and through numer-
ous underground channels. (Barnes, 1943, p. 43)
The primary radio service used by OWI was Voice of
America, which began in February 1942. Although the
United States had led the world in radio broadcasting, this
was its first effort at government-sponsored international
broadcasting.
Leonard Carlton (1943), chief of the program preparation
division of the Overseas Operation Branch of the OWI rec-
ognized that understanding what international audiences
needed and wanted was a learning process for the fledgling
broadcaster. He said,
We have had to recognize the fact that in our most
important audiences the great hunger is for very hard,
factual news. Even our best friends in occupied lands
distrust "propaganda," and many of them have made
known that distrust to us quite clearly. They want
information, hard news--the true account of what is
going on, even when the news is unpleasant. American
short wave radio, therefore, insists upon truth in its
news as well as in the commentaries which are based
upon the news. Such bitter pills as Pearl Harbor have
been presented without apology. (Carlton, 1943, p. 47)
One of the main program series used by the OWI to pres-
ent information about the United States was called
"Answering You." For this program, the BBC would supply
questions provided by a variety of Englishmen on all aspects
of American life and culture, which would then be answered
by various well-known Americans such as Clifton Fadiman,
George Gallup, Henry Kaiser, John Gunther, Geoffrey
Parsons, Publisher W. W. Waymack of the Des Moines
Register & Tribune, Carl Van Doren, Eleanor Roosevelt,
Margaret Mead, and Dorothy Kenyon. The series was
Clark and Christie 3
broadcast over the BBC in Britain "at a peak hour [and] . . .
an audience report show[ed] that 12.1 per cent of the English
adult civilian population listened" (Carlton, 1943, p. 52). A
similar series of programs was started in February for the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and a similar series
was also started in Arabic.
Other types of programming featured music and also tes-
timonies from immigrants in the United States directed at
their former country. For example,
To Arabic countries, Outpost sends records of their
countrymen in America. Interviews with students of
Turkish nationality in America, women's programs,
and Hollywood interviews are sent to Turkey. To
Sweden the Outpost Division sends messages from
Swedish Americans, and a weekly report from
Minnesota. (Carlton, 1943, p. 53)
Using individuals from different cultures in this way was
an attempt to bridge the wide cultural gap that the United
States faced. It also understood that to reach an out-group, it
was important to not only broadcast in a way that appealed to
them but also use technology that was accessible and famil-
iar to them.
The OWI explored many different ways in which to
"transmit" its programming. The first was the development
of shortwave transmissions through Voice of America.
However, the OWI also used what it termed "relay broad-
casting" where a shortwave signal was picked up and
rebroadcast via medium wave (MW) by stations all over
the world. Finally, the OWI also prerecorded programs and
then sent those programs to MW stations in "allied and neu-
tral lands" (Carlton, 1943, p. 48). Languages used for the
broadcasts included English, Persian, Turkish, Afrikaans,
Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Swedish,
French, and Icelandic (Carlton, 1943).
What the Overseas Radio Bureau of the OWI found effec-
tive was that through rebroadcasting it was able to "reach
large audiences listening on their own small radio sets to
their home stations" (Carlton, 1943, p. 53).
As Carlton (1943) noted, through the broadcasts,
Friendly and neutral nations can be told about the
American people and their institutions, their music and
their general attitude on the war and the post-war
world. These programs, because they are our radio
ambassadors to so many people, are produced accord-
ing to the best standards of American radio. Because
they are not subject to the mechanical limitations
imposed by short wave radio (fading, atmospherics,
and jamming), Outpost programs can be more subtle
and can use emotional techniques which are of limited
usefulness in other phases of international radio. (p. 53)
Finally, to broadcast to a foreign audience via shortwave,
the OWI and Voice of America encountered issues that the
average domestic station did not have to deal with. As
Carlton (1943) stated,
American domestic radio had never been called upon
to face such problems as how to get a short wave mes-
sage through atmospheric disturbances or through
deliberate enemy jamming. Certain voices excellent
on regular domestic radio were found quite unusable
in international broadcasting. Problems of speaking
speed, of the use of music, of humor, and of sound
effects had to be solved. Faced with the urgency of
war, the United States has had to solve these problems
and build a world-wide radio service with great rapid-
ity. It has had to build under many difficulties and with
little previous experience in the field. It stood its first
great test on November 7. There will be other tests in
the future, and for these tests it is gathering its
resources in technical facilities, sense of direction, and
experience. (p. 54)
Today, shortwave broadcasting in the United States
appears to be on its way out.As part of its Financial Year (FY)
2011 budget submission, the Broadcasting Board of
Governors (BBG) proposed to close the last U.S.-based short-
wave broadcasting facility, estimating that US$3.2 million
can be saved by the closure. This proposal to severely curtail
shortwave broadcasts is causing concern, particularly as there
are many people in the world who still use shortwave, and as
countries such as China continue and even increase their
shortwave operations as the United States draws down
(Committee on Foreign Relations, 2010).
The challenges faced by early government broadcasting
policy makers have changed little in the past 70 years; how-
ever, the means to reach the audiences have changed. Instead
of using shortwave as the primary broadcast tool, the U.S.
international broadcasting services are focusing on the
Internet, terrestrial broadcasting, and satellite television.
But, as early government radio officials realized, the critical
importance of identifying with the audience to provide cred-
ible news and information has not changed, and the raison
d'être and the programming content is very similar today as
it was in 1942.
Targeting the Middle East
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Middle
East became a renewed priority for U.S. broadcasting
efforts. The latest effort by the United States to use televi-
sion to reach audiences in the Middle East is Alhurra.
Alhurra is an Arabic-language television network launched
on February 14, 2004, and initially covered 22 countries in
the Middle East using the same satellites that regional
Arabic stations use (Blaya, 2007). The network is operated
by The Middle East Television Network, financed by the
American government through a grant from the BBG, a U.S.
federal agency that oversees U.S. international broadcasting
4 SAGE Open
efforts (About Us, 2005). Alhurra is expensive to operate
with a budget of about US$90 million (Committee on
Foreign Relations, 2010). According to Gary Ackerman
(2007), chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the
Middle East and Asia, Alhurra was,
Created . . . as an alternative with a purpose, with a
motive, not to distort journalism, not to lie, not to
change the truth, not to deny real facts, but to present
a view that was prevented from being presented on
most of the existing media . . . It was not created just
so that we could present both sides of the issue. We are
the other side of the issue, or that is what I believe the
Congress thought at the time of establishing this. (p.
45)
The station covers U.S. elections, with coverage of candi-
dates and issues, and it has reporters who cover the White
House, Congress, State Department, and the Pentagon. In
addition, Alhurra offers current affairs programs and docu-
mentaries that show U.S. life. For example, Inside
Washington takes viewers behind the scenes of the political
process in Washington with guests such as Supreme Court
Justices and various politicians. The station also produces a
documentary series on American culture and values,
Americans, and another current affairs program, Equality.
Joaquin Blaya (2007) noted that Equality is
hosted by a Saudi journalist, [and] discusses the rights
of women and tackles subjects such as young girls
being forced into marriage, the right of women to
drive and the rights of women in Islam. There has been
remarkable feedback on this program and others, some
praising the courageousness of this program and oth-
ers condemning Alhurra for discussing these topics.
(p. 38)
In March 2009, Alhurra began airing a brand new show
called Al Youm (Arabic for "Today"). The show is based on
the NBC Today Show and is a live three-hour news show,
produced Sunday through Thursday. Al Youm broadcasts
from a studio in Dubai, and "seeks to present the news in a
more relaxed, conversational environment" (Committee on
Foreign Relations, 2010, p. 39). Journalists on the show are
based in five cities: Cairo, Beirut, Jerusalem, Dubai, and
Washington, D.C., "from where they are projected onto a
screen in the Dubai studio to interact with the hosts"
(Committee on Foreign Relations, 2010, p. 39).
To assess audience reception to Al Youm's 2009 launch,
Dr. Nancy Snow of Syracuse University examined sample
media coverage of the program provided by the Middle East
Broadcasting Networks (MBN; Snow, 2010). Snow also
conducted an independent survey of online news
stories about "Al Youm" in its first ten months of
operation [and found the] response has been over-
whelming positive and a marked contrast to the nega-
tive coverage that had dominated the media landscape
about Alhurra from 2004-2008. (Snow, 2010, p. 10)
According to Snow, there are a number of things that
make this program appealing to viewers in the Middle East.
Snow (2010) reported that Al Youm uses "a hybrid style of
news programming that offers breaking news, soft news,
finance, education, science, and other topical subjects that
appeal to the region" (p. 10). She also calls the program
"groundbreaking" (p. 11) because "Never in the history of
television news has a live program originated from five
bureaus (Beirut, Cairo, Dubai, Jerusalem, Washington, D.C.)
across three continents" (Snow, 2010, p. 11). Finally she says
the show features well-known anchors and reporters, and the
programming has high production values (Snow, 2010).
According to a model posited by Clark and Christie (2004),
Alhurra and its programs such as Al Youm can be classified as
facilitative communication; that is, it serves to create a friendly
atmosphere and place the host country in the best possible
light. Martin (cited in Fisher & Merrill, 1976) believes gov-
ernments do not spend the most money on propaganda but on
"facilitative communication" (p. 263) where the primary func-
tion is to create "a friendly atmosphere, or, as a psychologist
might put it, a favorable affect" (p. 263). Such programming
includes newscasts, press releases, and artistic and cultural
programs. However, as of late it appears that the audience for
Alhurra has dwindled (polling has not been conducted to
assess the success of Al Youm). A recent government report
states that Alhurra is watched in Iraq but not really anywhere
else. The report states that "given the crowded media environ-
ment of the Middle East, either greater resources must be
devoted to marketing and promotion or additional program-
ming changes must be enacted in pursuit of increasing the
channel's market share" (Committee on Foreign Relations,
2010, p. 6).
Alhurra Reviews
In 2008, two universities and the U.S. Department of State
and the BBG Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted
reviews of Alhurra's programming, operation, and journal-
istic practices. The University of Southern California
report, "An Evaluation of Alhurra Television Programming"
(2008), found that there was "A lack of news and topical
programming tailored to the interests of the Arab audience"
(p. 4). By this, the researchers felt that Alhurra was per-
ceived as being similar to state-funded broadcasters and had
done little to create a unique brand, differentiating itself in
"style, format and breadth of coverage" (p. 4) to attract a
large audience.
In terms of journalistic practice, the study cited "weak jour-
nalism" (An Evaluation of Alhurra Television Programming,
2008,p.4)and"perceivedbias"(p.5)intwoareas.Technically,
Clark and Christie 5
the product was not as good as that of its competitors, and the
stories lacked balance and attribution. The study noted that
WhenAlhurra was critical of a particular view of issues,
it was six times more likely to be critical of the Arab/
other perspective than theWestern viewpoint. Moreover,
it was twice as likely to praise the Western outlook
rather than the Arab/other perspective. (An Evaluation
of Alhurra Television Programming, 2008, p. 5)
When personal opinions were expressed, they were more
likely to favor the West, particularly when the topics were
Israeli­Arab relations and Arab human rights.
The University of Southern California report stated that
Alhurra's programming was likely to be seen as propaganda
when compared with its competitors because its coverage
was not evenhanded. This was also observed in its reporters'
reliance on official sources instead of independent voices or
those of the average Arabic citizen.
Kent Collins (2008) from the University of Missouri con-
ducted a thorough review of Alhurra stories and newscasts
for a study titled, "Alhurra Television Focus Group Research
Project." The study found that "despite recent criticism in the
American media and politically biased criticism in the
Middle East, Alhurra Television does most things right most
of the time" (Collins, 2008, p. 3). The Missouri study noted
that development of Alhurra was without parallel in
American television history. The station was established
very quickly, and now more attention needs to be paid to
content and journalistic practices. As the study notes,
Journalism everywhere is subject to criticism and
second-guessing and political influence. Compare the
current critique of the American media in the coverage
of the domestic presidential campaign to the more
complicated political, ethnic, religious and nationalis-
tic environment in which Alhurra operates. (Collins,
2008, p. 11)
In May 2008, the U.S. Department of State and the BBG
OIG released a Report of Inspection on Alhurra's
Programming Policies and Procedures (2008). The report
was in response to a request by the House Committee on
Appropriations. According to the OIG report (2008),
Congress's concern dates back to at least December
2006, when certain programs were aired on Alhurra
that did not appear to some to follow the editorial
principles stated in the U.S. International Broadcasting
Act of 1994. Specifically, the House Report asked for
a review of the editorial policy in place in 2006 and
2007 regarding broadcasts involving terrorists or those
who support them; whether any changes were made to
that policy or the Alhurra's journalistic code during the
period; who was responsible for enforcing the policy;
what action, if any, was taken against those who vio-
lated the policy; what management changes have been
made to ensure the policy and journalistic code is
monitored and enforced; and whether there are clear
lines of authority at Alhurra to provide for account-
ability of journalistic decisions. (p. 4)
The OIG report noted that "MBN during the past
year has put into place more vigorous policies, procedures,
training, and tools for transparency in order to preserve its
credibility" (p. 13). Credibility is critical to such an interna-
tional broadcasting operation. If it is not deemed credible by
its audience, the station will not achieve its foreign policy
goals. As Seib (2008) noted,
The relationship between media ownership and news
product integrity is a global issue, whether it involves
the Emir of Qatar and Al Jazeera or the U.S. govern-
ment and Alhurra . . . In the Middle East, where trust
is a limited commodity, the issue is particularly sig-
nificant for any news organization trying to enter or
expand in the market. (p. 32)
Therefore, in the case of Alhurra, it is important to under-
stand the influence of such broadcasting efforts and to be
able to predict who might watch Alhurra's programming.
The "injection" of a government's message is not automatic
or assured--a government's efforts to change hearts and
minds starts with an understanding of the nature of the audi-
ence. Although studies have determined the basic nature of
Alhurra use, there have been no studies integrating the cul-
ture of the viewers, and no studies have attempted to ana-
lyze those audience characteristics that predict either
viewing or nonviewing. Instead, studies have focused on
estimating audience size or basic credibility. In discussing
the need for a greater depth of research in this area, U.S.
Congressman Gary Ackerman (2007) noted,
To be sure, Radio Sawa, Alhurra, Radio Farda, and
VOA's Persian and Urdu language television play
crucial roles in providing news and information to
audiences in ways they would not otherwise see or
hear it . . . Simply measuring audience size is great,
but it does not tell us how much or whether our broad-
casting influences those who receive it. I have heard,
anecdotally, that Radio Sawa is very popular among
its target audience in the Arab world, but I have also
heard that those who listen to it turn it off when the
news comes on because they know it is an American
broadcast. If that is true, how does that help us? (p. 2)
Dabbous and Nasser (2009) conducted a survey of how
Alhurra was perceived by Lebanese university students.
They found that Lebanese students tended to watch Al
Jazeera and Al Arabiya much more than Alhurra. They found
6 SAGE Open
that the number of hours a student spent watching Alhurra is
not a predictor of the student's positive attitude toward the
United States. Those who knew that the station was spon-
sored by the United States viewed it as less credible than
those who were unaware of its affiliation with the United
States.
Douai (2010) conducted focus groups in Morocco, and
when the topic of Alhurra was raised found that "no [partici-
pant] was able to isolate Alhurra from the United States, and
no [participant] was able to isolate the credibility of the sta-
tion from the credibility of the United States" (p. 86).
To place this study in context, it is important to under-
stand a little more about the U.A.E., including demographic
information, its relationship with the United States, and the
media climate in the country.
Reaching the U.A.E.Through Cultural Understanding
The U.A.E. is one of the few countries in the Middle East
that maintains close ties with the United States and has
actively assisted the United States in its attempts to fight
terrorism. The U.A.E. has been an important target of the
U.S. government in its attempt to provide its perspective on
news and information in the Middle East (BBG in the News,
2004). The United States was the third country to establish
formal diplomatic relations with the U.A.E. and has had an
ambassador resident in the U.A.E. since 1974. In 2002, the
United States and the U.A.E. started a dialogue on virtually
every aspect of the bilateral relationship. In 2004, the U.A.E.
signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
(TIFA) with the United States and agreed to negotiate
toward a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United
States (U.S. Department of State, 2007). The U.A.E. is a key
partner with the United States in the War on Terror. The
U.A.E. ports host more U.S. navy ships than any port outside
the United States (U.S. Department of State, 2007).
The U.A.E. is a Middle Eastern federation of seven states
located in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering
the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and
Saudi Arabia. The capital city is Abu Dhabi.
The U.A.E. has one of the most diverse populations in the
Middle East. Of the 4.45 million people living in the country,
Emiratis, the national ethnic group, accounts only for 19%.
Other significant ethnic groups are other Arab and Iranian
(23%), South Asian (50%), and Westerners and East Asians
(8%; Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2007).
U.A.E.'s gender imbalance is the highest in the world
with a ratio of 2.19 males to females. Almost 79% of the
U.A.E.'s population is between the ages of 15 and 64, with
the total median age being 30.1 years (32 years for males and
24.5 years for females). Almost 88% of the population lives
in urban areas with the most populated city being Dubai,
with approximately 1.5 million people. The official language
is Arabic, although the other widely used languages include
Persian, English, Hindi, and Urdu. About 96% of U.A.E.
citizens are Muslim with 4% being Hindu or Christian (CIA,
2007).
Characteristics of U.A.E. Media
The 2007 Freedom of the Press report, published by the
Freedom House, suggests the mass media in the U.A.E. are
not free (Freedom House, 2007). Formally, the constitution
guarantees freedom of the press. However, journalists
often practice self-censorship because of laws that prohibit
criticism of the government, ruling families, and friendly
governments, and outlaw other statements considered a
threat to social or economic stability. All publications must
be licensed with the Ministry of Information (Freedom
House, 2006).
The media industry in the U.A.E. is developed through a
number of microcities, for example, Dubai Media City
(www.dubaimediacity.com). Dubai Media City is a tax-free
zone within Dubai and is designed to be the media hub of the
region. It encompasses both the creation of media and the
advertising and marketing industry. Numerous international
news organizations, such as Reuters, Associated Press,
France Press, Bloomberg, Dow Jones Newswires, CNN, and
the BBC, have local offices in Dubai Media City.
Alternatives to mainstream media in the U.A.E. are lim-
ited as the U.A.E. uses filtering software to block sites with
what it deems to be objectionable Internet content. These
include pornography, gambling, religious conversion, and
illegal drugs sites. The state also blocks access to all sites in
the Israeli top-level domain (OpenNet Initiative, 2006).
Understanding the media climate in the U.A.E. is impor-
tant because if audiences within the U.A.E. perceive media
sources from within their country to be not objective or not
credible, then they will look to outside alternatives for their
source of news and information. Conversely, audiences may
be happy with what they receive from the local media but
still be interested in what other sources have to say about
issues around the region and the world.
Social identity theory may explain the use of international
media in a culture markedly different from the United States.
For example, given the unpopularity of the U.S. involvement
in Iraq throughout the Middle East, the Middle East popula-
tions may feel a strong identification within their countries.
According to Social identity theory, identification with a
group often includes a favorable bias toward one's own
group, and out-group rejection and even discrimination
toward the other group (Tajfel, 1978). This is increasingly
likely to be true when a group is very important to its mem-
bers and when they perceive conflict with the out-group
(Brown, 1996). Thus, due to the nature of the conflict
between the United States and Iraq and other parts of the
Middle East, people from the Middle East may identify
strongly with themselves and tend to discount the ideas and
beliefs of the United States presented on a television network
in their country. This identification could be followed with a
Clark and Christie 7
comparison with other groups on the basis of a value dimen-
sion. Tajfel and Turner (1985) noted that classification in
social identity theory is revealed though several social cate-
gories including religion, gender, and age.
Thus, in our attempt to understand the audiences and pro-
file factors in viewing or not viewingAlhurra Television, key
variables related to these attitudinal, cultural, and media use
characteristics were selected for examination, in an effort to
answer the following research questions:
Research Question 1: To what extent, if any, do basic
audience characteristics such as age, gender, edu-
cation, and employment of the population in the
U.A.E. predict Alhurra Television viewing/non-
viewing?
Research Question 2: To what extent, if any, does gen-
eral media use predict Alhurra Television viewing/
nonviewing?
Research Question 3: Do assessments of favorable
attitudes toward the United States by audiences (as
an out-group) predict Alhurra Television viewing/
nonviewing?
Even though these audience variables alone do not define an
in-group's culture, they are indicators of patterns, behaviors,
and values needed to gain an understanding of the audience
sought by U.S. international broadcasting efforts. In addi-
tion, if these indicators were found to be actual predictors of
viewing the U.S. broadcasting outlets, the finding could
either validate or negate the premise of U.S. international
broadcasting policy that has existed for more than 70 years.
Method
Such audience characteristics can best be observed through
surveying members of the target audience. Therefore, data
for this study were drawn from a July-August 2007 survey
exploring the audiences of Alhurra Television and Radio
Sawa in the U.A.E. The survey was conducted by the Pan
Arab Research Center of Dubai, U.A.E. The sample was
designed to be nationally representative of the 15- to
34-year-old population group (n = 503).
This age group was identified as an important and influ-
ential group for the U.S. government to target in their efforts
to reach the Middle East (Pattiz, 2005). Pattiz (2005) noted
that, while Alhurra Television reaches all age groups, the
younger Arab population is a particular concern to the U.S.
government because of unemployment and disaffection,
having "few opportunities for social mobility and progress.
They are ripe for exploitation by radical Islamic fundamen-
talist ideology and elements of Arab media that seek to incite
them. Reaching them is key" (p. 76).After drawing a random
sample of the U.A.E. among Arabic respondents aged 15 to
34 years, face-to-face interviews with respondents at their
places of residence were used to complete questionnaires
translated into the Arabic language.
To examine the effects of viewing Alhurra Television, it
was necessary to identify two basic groups of individuals--
those who viewed this source of information and those who
did not. The dependent variable used to answer research
questions ascertained the use or nonuse of Alhurra
Television. Respondents were asked, "Could you please
tell me if you watch Alhurra Television?" The two groups
of viewers and nonviewers were derived from this response.
Thus, the two groups of viewers and nonviewers comprised
the dichotomous categories of the dependent variable in
this study.
Independent variables used to predict either viewing or not
viewing Alhurra Television included demographic variables
of gender, media use, age, education, and employment status.
In addition to these variables, the possible influence of two
other variables was explored: use of Radio Sawa and attitudes
toward the United States. The Radio Sawa variable was
worded, "Do you listen to Radio Sawa?" with a value of "1"
assigned for listening and a value of "0" for nonlistening. The
"attitude toward the U.S." variable was worded, "How favor-
ably do you feel about the U.S.A.?" A 1- to 10-point semantic
differential scale was provided for response to this question,
with a higher score indicating an unfavorable attitude.
To prepare the data for the statistical method selected for
analysis, responses to most demographic questions were
recoded as dummy variables, with values of 1 assigned to a
positive response, and negative responses to the questions
were coded with a 0. The education variable contained inter-
val-level categories, with the lowest of four values (1) assigned
to less than a high school education and the highest value (4)
assigned to a postgraduate education. The age variable was
coded by 4-year categories of the reported years of age.
Results
The results are based on face-to-face survey interviews of a
random U.A.E. nationwide sample of 503 adults between
the ages of 15 and 34, during July-August 2007. Of those
responding, 48.7% (n = 245) of the respondents were male,
and 51.3% (n = 258) were female. This younger group may
represent a somewhat higher proportion of females than
what is found in the general population among this age
group.
Married respondents were 43.7% of the sample, and
56.3% reported being single. The largest group of respon-
dents, 42.9% (n = 216) of the sample, was U.A.E. nationals,
followed by Egyptian (11.5%), Jordanian (8.7%), Sudanese
(8.5%), and Palestinian (7.6%) respondents. The remaining
nationalities included in the survey were Lebanese, Syrian,
Yemeni, and those from other Arabic countries.
A relatively high degree of media usage was found
among respondents. When asked if they listen to radio, for
example, 85.9% (n = 432) respondents answered positively,
and 14.1% (n = 71) said they do not listen to radio. Almost
a half of respondents (48.1%) who listen to radio reported
listening daily.

Respondents who listen to radio were asked if they listen
to Radio Sawa. About two thirds (60.2%) of respondents
replied positively, and 39.8% said they do not listen to Radio
Sawa. These listeners were asked how much time on average
are they listening to Radio Sawa. Almost one third (31.5%)
listen daily, another 19.6% listen 5 to 6 times a week, 18.1%
listen 3 to 4 times a week, 19.6% and 11.2% listen to Radio
Sawa 1 to 2 times a week or less often, respectively.
Asked if they watch television, 98.6% (n = 496) of
respondents answered positively and 1.4% (n = 7) did not
watch television. Among respondents who watch TV, 86.9%
watch TV daily, 4.6% suggested they watch TV 5 to 6 times
a week, 4.8% watch TV 3 to 4 times a week, 2.6% and 1%
watch TV 1 to 2 times a week or less often.
Respondents who watch TV daily or 5 to 6 times a week
(n = 454, 91.5%) were asked if they watchAlhurraTelevision.
Half of respondents (50.7%) replied positively and the other
half (49.3%) said they do not watch Alhurra Television.
Respondents watching Alhurra Television (n = 230) include
12.6% who watch it daily, 13% who watch it 5 to 6 times a
week, 23% who watch it 3 to 4 times a week. The remaining
viewers--almost half of the group--watch Alhurra
Television 1 to 2 times a week or less often.
When asked about the reasons for not watching Alhurra
Television, respondents mentioned the following rationale:
(a) prefer to watch other channels like Al Jazeera and Al
Arabia because they are more credible (33.5%), (b) do not
care about watching news (15.2%), (c) Alhurra is not a trust-
worthy channel (11.2%), (d) do not like Alhurra (10.3%),
(e) never heard about it (8%), (f) no entertaining programs
(3.1%), (g) there are lots of channels to watch (3.1), and (8)
none (3.1%).
Respondents who did not report watching Alhurra
Television (n = 224) were asked to indicate where they get
their television news. Two thirds of the respondents men-
tioned Al Jazeera, and more than half of the respondents
(54.9%) also mentioned Al Arabiya. Other TV sources that
were mentioned were Al Ekhbariya (5%), Al Manar (4.1%),
CNN (2.5%), Dubai TV (2.3%), Al Alam (0.9%), BBC World
(0.7%), Egypt (0.5%), MBC (0.5%), Dream (0.2%), and
Dubai Sports (0.2%).
In responding to all three research questions, a discrimi-
nant function analysis was used to determine the extent that
basic audience characteristics such as age, gender, educa-
tion, and employment of the population in the U.A.E.; media
listening habits; and attitudes toward the United States
predicted Alhurra Television viewing/nonviewing. The test
was conducted to investigate the importance and association
of a set of predictor variables--gender, media use, age, edu-
cation, employment status, Radio Sawa listening, and atti-
tudes toward the United States--to discern Alhurra viewing
(or nonviewing) using these variables. This test was best
suited to answer the research questions in this study because
of the previously cited work that identified these two groups
of interest to researchers and because of the test's ability to
predict group membership (viewing or not viewing) from a
linear combination of variables. Discriminant function
"uses mathematical techniques to determine the way of
computing scores that results in the best separation among
the groups" (Norusis, 1988, p. 379). Thus, given a set of
potential predicting variables, the test can best determine
the set of viewer and nonviewer characteristics within those
variables. More commonly used statistical tests, such as
multiple regression, were not appropriate for this study
because of the ordinal nature of the dependent variable--in
this case, viewing and not viewing. Actual survey results
indicate that 57.1% of the respondents of the U.A.E popula-
tion view Alhurra; 42.9% of the respondents did not view
Alhurra and comprised the nonviewing group. The canoni-
cal discriminant functions, a measure of how well the func-
tion discerns viewing and not viewing Alhurra, revealed an
eigenvalue of .08, representing the between-groups variance
divided by the within-groups variance on the function for
viewing or not viewing Alhurra (Table 1). The canonical
correlation is .27 on this function, indicating discriminating
power (predicting viewing or not viewing based on this set
of variables).
With the function included in the analysis, Wilks's
Lambda is .93 for Alhurra viewing and not viewing, indicat-
ing differences between groups account for 9.2% (p < .05)
of the variance in the predicting demographic, media use,
and attitudes toward the U.S.A. variables. Table 2 presents
the standardized canonical discriminant function coeffi-
cients of the independent variables, indicating the strength
or weakness of the individual variables as predictors of
viewing and not viewing. Five of seven Alhurra viewing/not
viewing predictor variables drawn from the three research
questions (education, age, Radio Sawa listening, gender,
and radio listening) rated high on this function and were
the stronger predictors of viewing and not viewing. Two of
the variables were negative predictors (education and radio
listening). The employment predictor was a weaker
Clark and Christie 9
predictor, and the "feelings about the U.S.A." variable was
the weakest predictor of Alhurra use.
Using this set of independent variables to predict Alhurra
viewing, 65.5% of all cases were correctly classified by this
analysis.
Discussion and Limitations
This study found the high percentages of Alhurra-viewing
classification using the discriminant function suggest that
the combination of key cultural indicator variables is a
sound predictor of viewing this news source. Thus, this
study validates the premise of U.S. policy as it confirms the
challenges faced by international broadcasting 70 years ago
and today--the role key cultural indicators play when these
viewers decide to turn to or away from, in this case Alhurra,
for news and other information.
U.S. international broadcasting efforts began 70 years
ago with the creation of Voice of America. The challenge
back then was to reach two audience groups: those who
were friendly toward the United States and those who were
antagonistic. The challenge was also to preserve the friend-
ship of one group while attempting to win the hearts and
minds of those who had a less favorable view of the United
States. The philosophy was that if the truth was presented in
a friendly (and culturally sensitive) way, people hostile to
the United States might be won over. That effort, with its
many challenges, technical and programmatic, continues
today through the use of Alhurra. Examining the traditional
media use variables (Research Question 2), regular radio
listening appears to be a relatively strong predictor of
Alhurra viewing or nonviewing. This suggests that Alhurra
Television may be considered another media source by this
population in the U.A.E.
Listening to Radio Sawa (its radio counterpart) was a
strong predictor of Alhurra viewing or nonviewing, suggest-
ing a possible linkage between perceptions of the two media.
Radio Sawa listeners who also viewAlhurra may be doing so
to find a video source to complement the information they
hear by radio. Perhaps these viewers need more perspective
based on their exposure to Radio Sawa. In this case, an indi-
vidual's value judgment of Radio Sawa may prompt Alhurra
viewing. This suggests that, in this sense, the two media
sources are complementary.
The findings related to the demographic variables exam-
ined (Research Question 1) suggest that the in-group identity
of the population, as manifested in the age, education, gen-
der, and employment variables, are powerful predictors of
viewing or not viewing Alhurra. Although the exact nature of
this influence cannot be determined in this study, this study
finds that these key cultural indicator variables are core pre-
dictors among this younger age group. From a U.S. govern-
ment programming perspective, these factors should inform
Alhurra programming decisions. For example, creators of
content on Alhurra should understand that reaching this key
younger demographic involves further exploration of the
influence of gender, age, and educational levels on viewing.
The results also suggest that feelings toward the United
States play little or no role in predicting Alhurra viewing or
nonviewing. This suggests that this basic attitude about a
major out-group--the U.S. government (Research Question
3)--may not affect whether or not this U.A.E. population
either turns to or rejects Alhurra Television. For example, it
is possible that the U.A.E. population watches Alhurra even
if they disagree with the news presentation. Perhaps viewers
watch for reasons of curiosity or to confirm previously held
negative beliefs.
Limitations of this study center on a need to understand
the audience's motivations for viewingAlhurra news. Further
studies could explore why these viewers watch the program-
ming, even if they dislike the United States or the U.S. source
of programming. Qualitative research methods such as focus
groups on in-depth interviews would be useful in ascertain-
ing why these media choices are made. In addition, this study
only examined a younger demographic in the U.A.E, a nation
historically friendlier to the United States than other Arabic
nations. Surveys should also be conducted in less friendly
nations to confirm the findings of this study. Other limita-
tions of this study include possible audience resistance to
simply discussing Alhurra Television and surveying audi-
ences in this region given the prevalence of anti-American-
ism in the Arab world (Douai, 2010).
As we look back on the early efforts of the OWI, and on
the use of Alhurra today, what is interesting is that this study
reveals that the criticism that OWI received back then could
apply to U.S. international broadcasting efforts in the present
time. In 1943, Joseph Barnes wrote, "The charge is that our
propaganda work is too simple, too provincially American,

and too deeply committed to using truth as a weapon with
which to confuse our enemies and give heart to our friends"
(p. 34).
One area of departure from the 1940s is that the United
States is now recognizing the need to reach audiences at
home in addition to audiences abroad. The U.S. committee
on foreign relations is considering revising the Smith­Mundt
act and allowing international broadcasters to target audi-
ences within the United States. As the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee notes,
Russia and China and other entities currently broad-
cast in English in the United States. Additionally,
recent Arabic speaking immigrants to the United
States are able to watch Al Jazeera but prevented by
Smith-Mundt from viewing Al Hurra. These realities,
coupled with the rise of the Internet, which enables
computer users in the U.S. to receive video and audio
streams of BBG broadcasts and readily access BBG
Web sites, demonstrate that aspects of the legislation
are both anachronistic and potentially harmful.
(Committee on Foreign Relations, 2010, p. 8)
In 1943, Hawkins and Pettee wrote that "Revolutionary
developments in the media have loaded the opinion process
with a dynamite which it has never before possessed"
(pp. 15-16). The same could be said today about Alhurra.
Any effort made by a government to influence public
opinion needs to first take into account the audience, and in
particular, the specific cultural characteristics of the
audience that predict the use of the medium conveying the
message. This study reveals that media use and key cultural
in-group variables play critical roles in predicting whether
the U.A.E. population turns to or away from this
U.S.-government-funded television network. It is noteworthy
that existing feelings toward the United States were shown to
play no role in predicting Alhurra viewing or nonviewing,
suggesting that viewers may be drawn by the content of the
programming of this outlet and not by the likes or dislikes
of the U.S. government. As was the case in 1943, when the
OWI realized the importance of reaching these in-groups
by incorporating people from these groups into radio pro-
gramming, the same challenge exists for the U.S. gover-
nment today--the need to relate on a cultural level with these
populations to convey credible messages through interna-
tional broadcasting.
Given the findings of this study, further studies should
examine the extent to which this programming results in
more (or less) favorable views of the United States and its
policies. Although Alhurra has made some major inroads in
attracting viewers, it remains to be seen if negative attitudes
and government policies about the United States will be
changed by this initiative and if the 70-year-old challenges
of reaching a hostile audience by bridging a cultural divide
through international broadcasting will be successful.
