Introduction
Ojeda et al. reported that growing fetuses display obvious
plasticity to adapt to the dynamically changing in utero
environment. Originally the so-called Baker Hypothesis
described permanent responses to the impairment and
stress in the developmental stages of a fetus, but since
then, this hypothesis has been renamed the Fetal Origins of
Adult Disease.1 In this process, the fetus may survive, but
exhibit permanent physiological, morphological and meta-
bolic responses that increase susceptibilities to particular
diseases. Recently, this concept has also been widely
referred to as the Developmental Origins of Health and
Disease.2
Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can result from maternal
dystrophia, preeclampsia and hyperuricemia. To protect
key organs (heart and brain), the blood is redistributed to
the key organs rather than the kidneys, liver and muscle
tissues, which results in the non-optimal development of
other organs under conditions of diminished oxygen and
nutrition, which can enhance the prevalence of various dis-
eases in adults.3 Currently, about 30 million newborns
worldwide are diagnosed with FGR, which is one of the
most important potential risk factors of future health-
related problems in humans.

Abstract
Objective: Kidney development is key to the onset of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in adults, and in the
fetal stage will be impaired by a lack of nutrients in utero in animal models. However, few human studies have been
performed.
Methods: Kidney samples from fetuses in a fetal growth restriction (FGR) environment were collected and the
morphological characteristics were observed. Potentially molecular mechanisms were explored by analyzing apoptosis
and kidney-development related gene expression.
Results: The results indicated that no malformations were observed in the kidney samples of the FGR group, but the
mean kidney weight and volume were significantly decreased. Moreover, the ratio of apoptotic cells and Bax-positive
cells was increased and the ratio of Bcl-2-positive cells was decreased in the FGR group, indicating potential apoptosis
induction under an in utero FGR environment. Finally, aberrant expression of renin and angiotensinogen indicated
potential kidney functional abnormalities in the FGR group.
Conclusions: Our study suggested increased apoptosis and decreased renin and angiotensinogen expression during
human kidney development in an FGR environment. The current results will be helpful to further explore the molecular
mechanism of FGR and facilitate future studies of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and the establishment of
preventive methods.

Moreover, some studies reported that hypertension in
adults aged 46­64 years was closely related to the inci-
dence of lower birth weight.4,5 Other than higher blood
pressure, low birth body weight may also induce the
increasing incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs) in adults. In Sweden, an epidemiological
study indicated that low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) and dimin-
ished weight gain by one year of age (< 8 kg) was strongly
correlated to the incidence of diabetes and myocardial
infarction later in life.6 Therefore, FGR in the perinatal
period may increase the risk of endocrinological abnor-
malities and CVD.
Although the mechanisms of FGR remain largely
unknown, the importance of FGR has been accepted
worldwide. Animal models have been used to mimic the
compromised uterine environment of FGR to identify
potential mechanisms. Typical methods to establish animal
models of FGR include total thermal limitation, total pro-
tein limitation, maternal chronic oxygen deficit, dysfunc-
tional placenta, and perinatal glucocorticoid treatment.
More recently, models of FGR have been successfully
established in mammals. In these models, significant cor-
relations were identified between FGR and the onset of
diseases in the mature animals. Offspring that matured in a
compromised uterine environment exhibited changes in
physiology and organ development. Moreover, kidney
impairment was prevalent in all of the animal models,
characterized by a decreased number of nephrons.
In humans, Keller et al. observed that the number of
nephrons decreased by up to 50% and the glomerular vol-
ume doubled in hypertensive patients when compared with
normotensive patients. These findings indicated that a
decrease in nephron number resulted in hyperpiesis and
the increased glomerular volume was attributable to com-
pensatory hypertrophy and ultrafiltration.7 Both research
teams studied kidney development in a FGR model and
suggested that the number of nephrons decreased by 35%
compared with normal fetuses.8,9 Regarding the roles of
the kidneys in the regulation of isohydria and blood pres-
sure,1,10 a decrease in the nephron number likely contrib-
utes to onset of adult diseases; however, specific
mechanisms remain largely unknown.
In the present study, we identified correlations between
birth body weight and the number of nephrons by calculat-
ing the number of apoptotic renal cells in fetuses under
FGR conditions compared with those of normal fetuses.
Finally, important genes and proteins that promoted or
inhibited apoptosis were identified and potential mecha-
nisms explored.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
All experimental protocols were approved by the insti-
tutional review board of Tianjin Central Hospital of
Gynecology Obstetrics (Tianjin, China). All partici-
pants were informed of all procedural details, including
the study duration, methods, publication of results and
the disposal of the research samples, and submitted
signed informed consent forms. No financial incentives
were offered for sample collection. We guaranteed that
all of the research samples were to be used for basic
scientific research and not medical purposes.
Kidney collection
A total of 11 FGR fetal kidney samples were collected
from pregnant women with or without preeclampsia from
November 2009 to December 2010 at Tianjin Central
Hospital, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Of
these samples, eight were obtained from pregnant women
with moderate to severe preeclampsia and three from
women with normal pregnancies. During the same period,
a total of 12 non-FGR samples were also collected from
women with normal pregnancies. All kidney samples had
normal morphologies with no obvious malformations.
The left kidneys were collected from late-term aborted
fetuses, weighed and immediately fixed with 10% forma-
lin before the nephron number was determined. The kid-
ney volume was calculated using the water displacement
method. Briefly, the kidney was submerged in a bottle full
of water and the overflow was collected to determine the
displaced volume.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
The kidney tissues were dehydrated with ethanol, embed-
ded in paraffin, cut into 4­6-m thick slices, dewaxed with
xylene, subjected to gradient alcohol hydration and stained
with H&E stain. The samples were cleared in xylene and
mounted under a light microscope (80i; Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan). Two experienced pathologists who were blinded to
the experimental protocol scored the kidney tissues for the
degree of apoptosis, and at least 20 H&E sections in each
group were scored.
Apoptotic cell identification via the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method
Apoptosis was indicated by DNA strand breaks in cell
nuclei and detected using the TUNEL assay according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The H&E-stained sec-
tions were deparaffinized, digested with proteinase K (20
g/ml; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and then
incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT) buffer (0.3 U/l) and biotinylated dUTP (0.2 mM;
Roche) in 1× TdT buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) for 1 h at 37°C. Next, the sections were incubated
in 10% normal horse serum to block nonspecific binding
1030 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an
avidin­biotin complex (dilution, 1:100) included in the
Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA, USA). The sections were then counter-
stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydro-
chloride (DAPI; Life Technologies) to identify cell nuclei
and examined by fluorescence microscopy (80i).
TUNEL-positive cells were counted in five randomly
chosen fields for each section and presented as a percent-
age of the total number of cells.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the kidney samples. cDNA
was synthesized from 1 g of DNase-treated RNA with
random hexamers and an 80-ng equivalent was used in
each PCR reaction. All cDNA synthesis and PCR reaction
components were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Expression levels of the selected target genes
were further analyzed by real-time PCR. cDNA was pre-
pared from 500 ng of total RNAfollowing DNase treatment
and 10 ng of RNAand gene-specific primers (Table 1) were
used for PCR amplification. Melting curve analysis was
performed at the end of each reaction. Data are presented as
the mean ± standard error of the mean from three independ-
ent experiments. Expression levels were normalized to
-actin (internal control).
Western blot analysis
The kidney samples were lysed in 200 µl of radioimmuno-
precipitation assay buffer containing fresh protease inhibi-
tor cocktail tablets. Equivalent amounts of protein, as
determined by the colorimetric Bradford protein assay,
were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis with 12% agarose gels and then trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, which were
then blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk before immuno-
assay using human monoclonal antibodies. Expression
levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (internal control).
Statistical analysis
Significant differences between the FGR and control
groups were identified using the t-test. A probability (p)
value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical data
General clinical data for the patients and fetuses are sum-
marized in Table 2. In the FGR group, the mean patient age
was 25.3 ± 5.3 years (range, 21­32 years), which was not
significantly different from that of the pregnant women in
the control group. In the FGR group, the mean pregnancy
duration was 33.4 weeks, which was comparable to that of
the pregnant women in the control group (Table 2).
In the FGR group, a total of 11 fetuses (six males and
five females) were collected, including three that died
intrauterine because of placental abruption induced by
severe preeclampsia, two from late-term abortions because
of malformations (one cheilopalatognathus and one dia-
phragmatocele) merged with severe preeclampsia, and six
because of FGR. In the control group, a total of 12 fetuses
(five males and seven females) were collected, including
four due to cheilopalatognathus, one with abnormal brain
development, two with diaphragmatocele, one with achon-
droplasia, two with esophageal atresia and two that were
aborted by parental consent. Of the 23 fetuses, all kidneys

had normal morphologies with no obvious malformations
(Table 3).
Characteristics of the kidney samples
To confirm the effects of FGR on kidney development,
characteristics of the kidney samples were analyzed. In the
FGR group, the average fetal birth weight was 1094 ± 383
g, which was significantly lower than that in the control
group (1964 ± 439 g). Moreover, the kidney weight and
volume collected from the FGR fetuses were also signifi-
cantly decreased compared with those in the control group.
The nephrons were counted, which showed a lower num-
ber in the FGR group (Table 4).
Next, fetal weight and the number of nephrons were
analyzed, which identified a significant positive correla-
tion (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, 0.86584; p <
0.001) (Figure 1), indicating that the decreased number of
nephrons contributed to decreased body weight. There
were no correlations between fetal gender and the number
of nephrons.
Apoptotic cell analysis
The TUNEL assay was performed to analyze the mecha-
nisms of impaired kidney weight and volume in the FGR
group. The positively stained cells, in which the nuclei
were stained yellow, were regarded as apoptotic (Figure
2(a) and (b)). A total of 1000 cells were analyzed in five
random views and the number of apoptotic cells was
recorded. The results showed that about 10% of cells in the
samples from the FGR group were apoptotic, whereas only
5.7% were apoptotic in the control group, which was sig-
nificantly lower (Figure 2(c)). Moreover, two apoptosis-
related genes were expressed in the FGR and control
groups. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a much
higher ratio of Bax-positive cells and much lower ratio of
Bcl-2-positive cells in the FGR group compared with the
control group (Figure 3).
Identification of renin and angiotensinogen in
kidney samples
To further identify differences between the FGR and con-
trol groups, two important genes closely related to kidney
development, renin and angiotensinogen, were analyzed
by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. The results showed
that the gene expression profiles of renin and angiotensino-
gen were significantly down-regulated in the FGR group
compared with those of the control group, and the protein
expression profiles showed similar tendencies (Figure 4).
Discussion
In the present study, we systematically investigated the
effects of FGR on kidney development and identified
important gene expression profiles. The results indicated
no malformations in the kidney samples from the FGR
group, but the mean kidney weight and volume were sig-
nificantly decreased compared with the controls. Moreover,
the ratio of apoptotic and Bax-positive cells was increased
and the ratio of Bcl-2-positive cells was decreased, which
indicated potential apoptosis induction under the in utero

FGR environment. Finally, the aberrant expression of two
important kidney development genes indicated potential
functional abnormalities in the FGR group.
Hypertension threatens the health of 25% of the popula-
tion worldwide and contributes to the onset of CVD and
chronic renal diseases;11 however, the pathology remains
unclear, resulting in the scarcity of preventive methods.2
Baker et al. suggested that CVD was actually the result of
the fetus adapting to the lack of nutrients in the uterine envi-
ronment, resulting in morphological and functional changes
of important fetal organs and an increased risk of hyperten-
sion and CVD later in life. These results were in accordance
with previous epidemiological investigations.12
Results from a previous animal model study suggested
that limited protein intake during pregnancy may result in
FGR with offspring with a decreased number of
nephrons,13-15 in accordance with results from a human
study.16 However, the molecular mechanisms remain
unknown. In the present study, we observed decreased
fetal body weight, kidney volume and weight, and number
of nephrons in the FGR group.
During development of organs and tissues, programmed
cell death is an important process; however, aberrant apop-
tosis will result in altered organ morphology and func-
tion.17 During kidney development, nephron formation
will be impaired in response to excessive cell death, result-
ing in the presence of atrophic nephrons. In the present
study, the number of apoptotic cells was increased in kid-
ney samples from the FGR group, which may have resulted
in the decreased kidney volume and weight, as well as the
lower number of nephrons. Welham et al. fed pregnant rats
with a low protein diet and observed that the offspring
became hypertensive because of the decreased number of
nephrons, the increased number of apoptotic cells, and the
changes in renin and angiotensinogen expression.
Therefore, they concluded that a lack of nutrients in the
uterine environment will result in hypertension when the
offspring mature into adults.18

In the present study, Bax and Bcl-2 expression were
analyzed. Bcl-2 is a key regulator of apoptosis inhibition,
which can prolong cell proliferation and increase cell num-
ber. Bax belongs to the Bcl-2 family, but functions in
opposition to Bcl-2. Bax can induce cell apoptosis and
inactive Bcl-2 by forming heterogenous dimers that coa-
lesce with Bcl-2.19-21 Pham et al. suggested that Bcl-2
expression was significantly down-regulated and Bax
expression was significantly up-regulated in FGR mod-
els,22,23 which was similar to our results in humans.

Results from a previous animal study suggested that
the decreased number of nephrons in FGR was not only
related to cell apoptosis, but also to the changes in the
renin­angiotensinogen system (RAS).24 RAS plays a key
role in the regulation of body fluids and salt metabolism,
and was higher expressed in the developing kidney. Thus,
aberrant expression of genes in the RAS will result in
abnormal kidney development. Goyal et al. observed a
decreased number of nephrons and onset of hypertension in
a mouse model treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker
and suggested that RAS plays a key role in kidney growth
and maturation.25 Grigore et al. feed neonatal mice with a
high dose of the angiotensin receptor inhibitor losartan and
found that all mice became hypertensive by the age of 22
weeks and the number of nephrons was decreased by at
least 42%, which indicated that insufficient angiotensin
activity will disrupt normal kidney development and result
in a decreased number of nephrons.26
In humans, Moritz et al. observed that cells containing
renin were located in the deep cortex and suggested that
both the lack of nutrients in the uterine environment and
inhibition of RAS activity resulted from kidney impair-
ment, and the limited supply of nutrients and oxygen
inhibited RAS expression.27 In the present study, we
showed that renin and angiotensinogen were two key
genes that were down-regulated in the RAS, which pro-
vided further proof of Moritz's hypothesis. Zhang et al.
suggested the mRNA expression of these two genes was
dysregulated in FGR offspring of sheep.28 However, in a
previous mouse study, Vehaskari et al. suggested the oppo-
site: an up-regulation of mRNA expression of the renal
renin protein,29 which may reflect a potential compensa-
tory mechanism when the fetus is subjected to a lack of
nutrients in the uterine environment.
In conclusion, the results of the present study sug-
gested the roles of apoptosis in kidney development of
human FGR fetuses and also indicated changes in RAS
gene expression profiles in these samples. The current
results will be helpful for further explorations of FGR
molecular mechanisms and also facilitate future studies of
