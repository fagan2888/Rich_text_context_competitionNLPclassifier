Abstract
Objective: To provide updated estimates of drinking water intake (total, tap, plain
bottled) for groups aged $1 year in the USA and to determine whether intakes
collected in 2005­2006 using the Automated Multiple-Pass Method for the 24 h
recall differ from intakes collected in 2003­2004 via post-recall food-frequency
type questions.
Design: Cross-sectional, observational study.
Setting: What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake component of the
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Subjects: Individuals aged $1 year in 2003­2004 (n 8249) and 2005­2006 (n 8437)
with one complete 24 h recall.
Results: The estimate for the percentage of individuals who reported total
drinking water in 2005­2006 was significantly (P , 0?0000) smaller (76?9 %) than
that for 2003­2004 (87?1 %), attributable to a lower percentage reporting tap water
(54?1 % in 2005­2006 v. 67?0 % in 2003­2004; P 5 0?0001). Estimates of mean tap
water intake differed between the survey cycles for men aged $71 years.
Conclusions: Survey variables must be examined before combining or comparing
data from multiple WWEIA/NHANES release cycles. For at least some age/gender
groups, drinking water intake data from NHANES cycles prior to 2005­2006
should not be considered comparable to more recent data.

National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey
What We Eat in America
Nationwide survey data permit estimation of water intake
both as a nutrient (total water/moisture; see definitions
in Table 1) and as a beverage (drinking water). The latter
is of interest for a broad range of research. Nationally
representative estimates of the intake of drinking water,
combined with estimates of moisture intake from food
and other beverages, were used in developing the Dietary
Reference Intakes for total water for the USA and
Canada(1). In the literature, many studies consider drink-
ing water in its role as a vehicle for water-borne nutrients,
chemical contaminants and micro-organisms(2,3); others
focus on the benefits of consuming water rather than
other beverages (e.g. reference (4)).
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US
Department of Health and Human Services have a long
history of collecting intake information on all types of
water. The two Departments have partnered in dietary
intake data collection since 2002, conducting the survey
What We Eat in America (WWEIA) as the dietary intake
interview component of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). The 24 h dietary recall
method used in WWEIA is the USDA five-step Automated
Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM)(5). The addition of the
collection of drinking water intake data to the AMPM
recall was initiated in WWEIA 2005­2006. Before 2005­
2006, plain water intake data were collected after the 24 h
recall via food-frequency type questions which asked
the respondent to estimate the total amounts of tap and
bottled water consumed the previous day. Based upon a
comprehensive review of water consumption studies, an
international panel concluded that a diary is the preferred
method for collection of water intake data, but that if a
diary is not feasible then a 24 h recall method ­ rather
than an FFQ ­ is the best alternative for obtaining valid,
complete water intake reports(3).
Certain research questions require either comparing or
combining data from multiple NHANES cycles. For example,
trends analysis, by definition, compares variables of interest
across time. The NHANES analytic guidelines strongly
recommend that researchers who wish to analyse data for
specific demographic sub-domains (e.g. by race/ethnicity
within age/gender group) combine data from consecutive
two-year cycles in order to produce estimates with greater
statistical reliability(6). Before performing analyses of these

types, however, users are instructed to confirm that data
items collected in all survey cycles included in the analysis
are comparable in wording and methods. Because of the
change in method, a comparison of the 2005­2006 estimates
of drinking water intake with earlier estimates is of interest.
Although a few studies have analysed current US intake
data collected using this new methodology(7­10), no study
to date has reported intakes of total drinking, tap and
bottled water for all age and gender groups.
The goals of the present study were twofold: for indi-
viduals aged $1 year, (i) to provide updated national
estimates of total drinking, tap and bottled water collected
in 2005­2006 using the AMPM; and (ii) to compare these
estimates with estimates based on data collected in
2003­2004 using the old frequency-type questions.
Methods
Sample
Water intake estimates presented are based on data from
8437 individuals aged $1 year who provided one com-
plete day of dietary recall data in WWEIA/NHANES
2005­2006(11). Although more current data have become
available (WWEIA/NHANES 2007­2008), the comparison
of water estimates across survey cycles was carried out
using the data sets immediately before and after the
methodological change in order to minimize the effect of
time on water consumption patterns. Earlier data used for
comparisons are from 8249 individuals the same age
interviewed in WWEIA/NHANES 2003­2004(12).
The NHANES samples for both 2003­2004 and 2005­2006
were designed to be representative of the civilian, non-
institutionalized US population, with oversampling of per-
sons aged 12­19 years and $60 years, low-income persons,
non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans and pregnant
women to improve accuracy of related estimates(13,14). The
data and accompanying documentation are available online
for both surveys(11,12). Breast-feeding children and pregnant
and lactating females were excluded from all analyses.
Water intake data
In the present study, the term `total drinking water' refers
to the sum of tap water plus plain bottled water (i.e. bottled
water without added sweetener or carbonation) that was
consumed as a beverage. Water consumed as a component
of another beverage or food (such as that contained in
bottled drinks, used in brewing coffee or added when
reconstituting condensed soup) is excluded.
Before and during WWEIA 2003­2004, intake infor-
mation on tap and plain bottled water was collected after
the 24 h recall, and information on sweetened water was
collected during the 24 h recall(12,15). In general, tap and
plain bottled water questions resembled food-frequency
questions in that the respondent was asked to give a
single estimate of total consumption for the day (Table 2).
Starting in WWEIA 2005­2006, data on all types of water
are collected during the 24h recall in the same manner as
for all other beverages and foods(5,11,16). Item-specific
information (such as type, amount, time and name of eating
occasion, etc.) that is obtained about foods and non-water
beverages is now also captured for drinking water.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were carried out using the statistical software
packages SAS release 9?1?3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)
and SUDAAN release 9?0 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). SUDAAN was used to
adjust for survey design effects resulting from NHANES'
complex, multistage, probability sampling(6,17,18).
Two-sided t tests were used to detect differences
between 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 estimates for the fol-
lowing variables: (i) percentage of individuals reporting
any plain water; (ii) mean intake of total plain water; (iii)
percentages reporting specific water types (tap, bottled);
and (iv) mean intake of each water type. Dietary sample
weights were applied in all analyses to produce nationally
representative estimates.
Results
The percentages of individuals reporting total drinking
water, tap water and plain bottled water on any given day
in 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 are shown in Table 3.
In 2005­2006, 76?9 % of individuals aged $1 year in the
USA reported drinking some water. For the all-inclusive
group of individuals aged $1 year, all of the subgroups
of males aged $14 years and females aged $71 years,
percentages reporting total drinking water were significantly
lower in 2005­2006 than in 2003­2004 (P,0?001). In
many of these age/gender groups, this decrease was driven
by lower percentages reporting tap water in 2005­2006. The
percentage of individuals reporting plain bottled water did
not differ significantly between the two survey cycles.
The mean total drinking water intake of adults aged
$19 years in 2005­2006 was slightly more than 1 litre/
person per d (Table 4); this mean value is based on both
reporters and non-reporters of water consumption. About
60 % of that amount was tap water and about 40 % was

bottled water. For total plain drinking water, no differ-
ences between 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 were found in
mean intakes per person. Men aged $71 years had a
lower mean intake of tap water in 2005­2006 than in
2003­2004 (0?51 litre v. 0?81 litre; P 5 0?0002). There were
no significant differences in estimates of plain bottled
water intake per person for any of the age/gender groups.
Discussion
Twenty-four hour recalls are preferable to FFQ for
obtaining valid, complete water intake reports(3). USDA's
AMPM (the 24 h recall method used in WWEIA) has been
called the `current state-of-the-art 24-hour dietary recall
instrument'(19). Although the validity of the AMPM as a
collection instrument for intakes of drinking water per se
has not been tested, research has shown that the AMPM
estimates energy intakes more accurately than FFQ do(20).
As shown by validation in doubly labelled water studies, the
AMPM yields very accurate, unbiased energy estimates for
highly motivated subjects(20), although reporting bias is still
possible among less motivated respondents and individuals
classified as overweight or obese(5).
The AMPM addresses the known issue of under-
reporting in intake surveys, having undergone extensive
methodological testing to enhance food recall and thus
minimize forgotten food items(5,21). Starting in 2005­2006,
specific mentions (probes) of water were incorporated
into AMPM questions in order to encourage respondents
to remember to report it. Water is included in both the
introductory question (`Please tell me everything you had
to eat and drink .. even snacks, coffee, soft drinks, water
[italics added], and alcoholic beverages') and the final
question (`Do you remember anything else you drank,
including water (italics added) y') of the AMPM(16).
Portion estimation aids including household cups, mugs
and glasses and a detailed USDA Food Model Booklet are
employed to help respondents estimate amounts con-
sumed, a technique recommended to enhance water
intake accuracy(3). Additional features of the AMPM that
encourage complete reporting are its administration by
trained interviewers and the collection of the first day's
intake (as used in the present analysis) in person(11,12).

-In all survey years, for types of water collected during the 24 h recall, the interviewer asked for enough information to assign the appropriate USDA food code.
Since 2002, the USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method guides the interviewer through a detailed path of standardized probes that are specific to water (only
sweetened water in 2002­2004; all types of water starting in 2005). In general, 24 h recall data include a USDA food code identifying the type of water
consumed, the amount consumed, the amounts of nutrients provided, the time and name of the eating occasion, and whether the water was consumed in
combination with other foods.

For all of these reasons, it is reasonable to consider the
current method of collecting drinking water intake data
preferable to earlier methods.
The mean intake of bottled water by all individuals aged
$2 years did not differ significantly between 2003­2004
(0?32 litre) and 2005­2006 (0?36 litre). However, the mag-
nitude of the non-significant difference between those
intakes (10?04 litre/d) aligns well with that of the apparent
increasing trend in bottled water consumption in the USA
based on disappearance data(22).

Change in water intake collection in the USA 1193

Decreases were found in the percentages of individuals
reporting tap water in several age/gender groups and in
the mean intake of tap water by males aged $71 years.
Although it is possible that a real change in tap water
intake occurred between 2003­2004 and 2005­2006, the
cross-sectional, observational nature of the present study
makes it impossible to distinguish secular trends from
artefacts related to methodological changes. Increased
sales of unsweetened carbonated (sparkling), flavoured
and enhanced waters during this time period(23) are
unlikely to explain the lower percentages reporting tap
water in 2005­2006, since the number of WWEIA
respondents who reported these kinds of water was very
low in both 2003­2005 and 2005­2006. Environmental
factors could explain some of the observed differences in
reporting between the survey periods. For example, a
drought in the Southeast USA during 2005 through the
winter of 2007(24) may have caused changes in drinking
water consumption behaviour in that region during the
2005­2006 data collection. As to whether the method
change might explain the differences in intake estimates,
the AMPM's demonstrated performance in collecting
complete food intake data(5) makes it highly unlikely that
collecting water data via the AMPM would result in
increased under-reporting. Rather, the opposite is more
likely: namely, that less over-reporting of tap water
intakes occurred in 2005­2006 when all water data were
collected via AMPM than in the earlier survey period
when they were collected via FFQ-type questions.
One conclusion that can be drawn from the differences
in percentages of individuals reporting water and in mean
water intakes between 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 is that it
may be inappropriate to combine data from older survey
cycles with newer data, at least for some age/gender
groups. Trends analysis of water intake data may be
contraindicated as well, given the (possible) impact of
this methodological change. The findings of the present
study illustrate the importance of careful examination of
survey variables before either conducting trends analysis
or combining data from multiple WWEIA/NHANES sur-
vey cycles. Despite these caveats, these data provide
benchmark estimates of drinking water intake in the USA;
invaluable information that is appropriate to use to
address a myriad of research questions.
Researchers should note the analytic benefits afforded
by the new method of collecting water data using the
AMPM. Among these benefits, the most evident is that
the WWEIA/NHANES total nutrient intake data files
now include drinking water's contribution not only to
moisture, but also to the nutrients Ca, Cu, Mg, Na and Zn.
Additionally, this methodological change has greatly
extended the array of variables that are available for
analyses involving water beyond its nutrient contribu-
tions. Data for each report of tap or plain bottled water
now include a USDA food code identifying the type of
water consumed, the amount (in grams) consumed on
that occasion, the intake day of the week, the main lan-
guage in which the interview was conducted, the time
each eating occasion began, the name by which the
respondent referred to the eating occasion (breakfast,
snack, etc.), whether the water was consumed at home or
