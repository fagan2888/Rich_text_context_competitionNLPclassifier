General Deterrence and International Conflict:
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory

Since general deterrence necessarily precedes immediate deterrence,
the analysis of general deterrence is more fundamental to an
understanding of international conflict than is an analysis of
immediate deterrence. Nonetheless, despite a few exceptions, the
quantitative literature has ignored the subject of general deterrence,
focusing almost exclusively on situations of immediate deterrence.
My purpose in this essay is to fill this evidentiary gap by subjecting a
recently developed theory of general deterrence--Perfect Deterrence
Theory--to a systematic test by examining general deterrence from
1816­2000. The results indicate that the predictions of perfect deter-
rence theory are strongly supported by the empirical record.

Deterrence is the use of a threat (explicit or not) by one party in an attempt
to convince another party not to upset the status quo. These threats have
two purposes. The purpose of direct deterrence is to deter a direct attack on
the defender. The goal of extended deterrence, conversely, is to deter attack
on one's allies (Snyder 1961:276­277). In addition, Morgan (1983) identifies
two basic kinds of deterrence situations: immediate and general. Immediate
deterrence "concerns the relationship between opposing states where at
least one side is seriously considering an attack while the other is mounting
a threat of retaliation in order to prevent it" (Morgan 1983:30). Classic

examples include the July Crisis of 1914, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
and most, if not all, acute interstate crises. General deterrence, by contrast,
"relates to opponents who maintain armed forces to regulate their relationship
even though neither is anywhere near mounting an attack" (Morgan 1983:30).
Thus, general deterrence has less to do with "crisis decisionmaking" than
with everyday decisionmaking in conflictual or adversarial relationships.
Huth (1988) combines these two kinds of deterrence situations with
the two types of deterrent threats to form four categories of deterrence:
direct-immediate deterrence, direct-general deterrence, extended-immediate
deterrence, and extended-general deterrence. Unlike many other works on
deterrence, this paper focuses on direct-general deterrence.
The need for immediate deterrence indicates that general deterrence
has previously failed (Danilovic 2001). If general deterrence succeeds, crises
and wars do not occur. Since general deterrence necessarily precedes
immediate deterrence, the analysis of general deterrence is more fundamental
to an understanding of international conflict than is an analysis of immediate
deterrence. Furthermore, because of selection effects, examining immediate
deterrence without consideration of general deterrence can lead to mislead-
ing empirical results. As Fearon (2002:15) observes, "hypotheses that are
valid for general deterrence should appear exactly reversed if we look at
cases of immediate deterrence."
Unfortunately, a divide exists between formal theories and the empiri-
cal analysis of deterrence. One reason for this divide is that while formal
theories have focused on general deterrence, the quantitative literature has
focused almost exclusively on immediate deterrence (Huth 1999). Important
exceptions include Weede (1983), who examined extended deterrence in
the cold war, and Sorokin (1994), who examined the impact of alliance for-
mation on extended general deterrence within the Arab­Israeli conflict.
Given their focus on extended deterrence, these studies are unable to pro-
vide insight on direct general deterrence. Huth and Russett (1993) did
examine direct general deterrence within the context of enduring rivalries.
They find that the balance of forces, arms races, and domestic conflict are
all important determinants of deterrence outcomes. However, they do not
directly test any specific theory of deterrence; indeed, formal theories of
general deterrence have never been subjected to direct empirical testing.
Indeed, this problem has unfortunately plagued formal theories through-
out political science (Green and Shapiro 1994), not only in the study of
deterrence. This is unfortunate since deterrence theory appears to shed
great light on the dynamics of deterrence, yet without extensive empirical
analysis, one cannot know how well these theories explain real-world phe-
nomena. One reason for this lack of testing is that, while selection of imme-
diate deterrence cases has received a great deal of attention (for example,
Huth and Russett 1984, 1988, 1990; Huth 1988), criteria for the selection of
general deterrence cases have remained elusive.

This paper has two related purposes. The specific purpose is to fill this
evidentiary gap by subjecting perfect deterrence theory--a recently devel-
oped theory of general deterrence--to a systematic test. I do so for several
reasons. First, perfect deterrence theory (Zagare and Kilgour 2000) is sup-
ported by a formal logic with explicit theoretical expectations that facilitates
empirical testing. Second, several preliminary tests of perfect deterrence
theory have rendered promising, albeit provisional results (Senese and
Quackenbush 2003; Quackenbush and Zagare 2006).1 And finally, as Huth
(1999) points out, standard formulations of deterrence--to the extent that
they have been explored empirically--are without compelling support.
The more general purpose is to develop the conceptualization and pro-
cedures to make such a test possible. This is necessary to bridge the divide
between formal theories and quantitative analyses of deterrence. Key con-
ceptualizations include case selection for direct general deterrence--I argue
that identifying opportunity for conflict is the key. In addition, this paper
offers the first direct test of incomplete information equilibrium predictions
made by formal deterrence theory. Conducting such a test requires mea-
surement of the utilities the actors have for the different outcomes that may
emerge, so a modification of the measurement procedures developed by
Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) is used. Also, since incomplete infor-
mation equilibria depend on each state's estimate of the opponent's credi-
bility, a nonlinear transformation technique is developed to estimate the
credibility parameters.
To test perfect deterrence theory, I examine general deterrence from
1816­2000. After detailing the equilibrium predictions of perfect deterrence
theory's unilateral deterrence game, I more fully discuss the research design
used to test them, including case selection, measurement of variables, and
statistical method. In the next section, I discuss the empirical results and the
theory's ability to explain general deterrence and international conflict. The
results indicate that perfect deterrence theory is well supported by the
empirical record. Finally, I compare these findings to previous results sup-
porting Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international interaction
game that is the basis of one of the most influential and important theories
of interstate conflict.
UNILATERAL DETERRENCE GAME
Perfect deterrence theory is an axiomatically distinct theoretical alternative
to classical deterrence theory, which focuses on ideas such as brinkmanship
and mutual assured destruction (for example, Schelling 1960, 1966; Powell
1In addition, Danilovic's (2002) empirical findings are consistent with the theory.
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 63
1990; see Zagare 2004 for a summary of differences between the two). I
focus on testing equilibrium predictions of the Unilateral Deterrence Game
developed by Zagare and Kilgour (2000: chapter 5).2 Furthermore, unlike
most previous tests of game-theoretic models, I focus on incomplete infor-
mation conditions, since incomplete information is an important factor lead-
ing to war (Fearon 1995).
Figure 1 shows the structure of this game, which has two players,
Challenger and Defender. At node 1, Challenger can choose whether to
cooperate or defect: if he cooperates, the Status Quo remains unchanged; if
he defects, Defender has an opportunity to respond. At node 2, Defender
can choose whether to concede or defy. If she concedes, the outcome is
Defender Concedes (DC), but if she defies, the next choice is Challenger's.
At node 3, Challenger can choose to concede, resulting in Challenger
Defeated (CD), or defy, resulting in Conflict (DD).
Challenger's utilities for outcome x are cx
, whereas Defender's utilities
are dx
, as indicated in Figure 1. Perfect deterrence theory highlights the
2Perfect deterrence theory relies on three core models: the Unilateral Deterrence Game, the Generalized
Mutual Deterrence Game, and the Asymmetric Escalation Game (Zagare and Kilgour 2000). The latter
game focuses on situations of extended deterrence, and is therefore inappropriate for the current focus
on direct deterrence. Furthermore, the unilateral deterrence game, unlike the mutual deterrence game,
allows for differentiation between states within a dyadic relationship. Accordingly, I focus on testing
equilibrium predictions of the Unilateral Deterrence Game

importance of two variables: capability and credibility. A state's threat is
capable if the threatened party believes that it would be worse off if the
threat were carried out than if it were not. For example, if Defender has a
capable threat, then Challenger prefers Status Quo to Conflict.
Credible threats are believable, and in order to be believable, they must
be rational to carry out (Zagare 1990). Therefore, a state that prefers conflict
to backing down has a credible threat, and is said to be "Hard." On the
other hand, a state that would rather back down than fight has an incredible
threat, and is said to be "Soft."
EQUILIBRIUM PREDICTIONS
Zagare and Kilgour (2000) provide complete solutions and discussion of the
Unilateral Deterrence Game. The equilibria are presented briefly in the
appendix, as is an original analysis of the situation where Defender's threat
is not capable. These equilibria are the basic predictions of perfect deterrence
theory to be tested. However, one cannot observe directly what equilibrium
is present at any one time; only the outcome can be observed. Therefore,
the equilibria must be further explicated to generate specific outcome pre-
dictions for the wide variety of conditions that may exist in reality. Three
situations may arise, each generating different predictions.
The first condition that may exist is where Challenger prefers the Status
Quo to Defender Concedes. Given no incentive to defect, Challenger will
always cooperate, leading to the Status Quo. Secondly, if Challenger prefers
Conflict to the Status Quo, then Defender lacks a capable threat. The solution
presented in the appendix shows that in this case the outcome is Conflict if
Defender is Hard, and if Defender is Soft the outcome is Defender Concedes.
Lastly, the most complicated scenario is when Challenger prefers
Defender Concedes to Status Quo and Defender has a capable threat. In this
case, only Certain Deterrence Equilibria make a unique outcome prediction
(Status Quo) over their entire range of existence. Multiple outcomes emerge
at intermediate (Separating Equilibrium) and low (Bluff and Attack Equilibria)
levels of Defender credibility.
Under a Separating Equilibrium, the player choices are completely
determined by their type. Therefore, Hard Challengers always defect at
node 1. A Hard Defender also always defies, so if both players are Hard, the
outcome is Conflict. However, a Soft Defender always concedes, so the out-
come (with a Hard Challenger) is Defender Concedes. But if Challenger is
Soft, he will always cooperate, resulting in Status Quo.
With an Attack Equilibrium, Challenger always defects initially, regard-
less of type. Therefore, the outcome reached is largely determined by
Defender's type. If Defender is Hard, she will defy and the outcome is Conflict
if Challenger is Hard as well. But in the unlikely event that a Soft Challenger
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 65
faces a Hard Defender, then the outcome is Challenger Defeated. A Soft
Defender always concedes, so the outcome is Defender Concedes.
Unfortunately, the Bluff Equilibrium does not provide unique outcome
predictions for each pair of player types like the other equilibria do. A Hard
Challenger always defects, as does a Hard Defender. Therefore, Conflict
results if both players are Hard. However, a Soft Defender defies with some
positive probability, so the outcome (with a Hard Challenger) will be either
Defender Concedes (if Defender concedes) or Conflict (if Defender defies).
A Soft Challenger also defects with some positive probability. So if a Soft
Challenger faces a Hard Defender, the outcome will be either Status Quo (if
Challenger cooperates) or Challenger Defeated (if Challenger defects ini-
tially). If both players are Soft almost anything can happen. If Challenger
defects initially and Defender concedes, the outcome is Defender Concedes.
But if Defender surprises Challenger by defying at node 2, then the out-
come is Challenger Defeated.3 Finally, if Challenger cooperates, the out-
come is Status Quo.
One additional equilibrium--Steadfast Deterrence Equilibrium--exists.
As with the Certain Deterrence Equilibrium, Status Quo is the only possible
outcome. However, this equilibrium exists at intermediate and low values of
Defender credibility, and thus coexists with equilibria of other types. Therefore,
through the Steadfast Deterrence Equilibrium, perfect deterrence theory pre-
dicts that the Status Quo is always possible as long as Defender's threat is
capable. Thus, Zagare and Kilgour's (2000:149) claim that successful "deter-
rence could conceivably emerge under (almost) any conditions in a one-sided
deterrence relationship."
These three basic conditions--1) where Challenger prefers Status Quo to
Defender Concedes, 2) where Defender lacks a capable threat, and 3) where
Defender's threat is capable--cover the entire range of possibilities. The out-
come predictions for each scenario are summarized in Table 1 and serve as
the equilibrium predictions to be tested in the empirical analysis to follow.
RESEARCH DESIGN
With the equilibrium outcome predictions now made, I turn to a presentation
of the research design used to test these predictions. I will discuss the selec-
tion of cases, measurement of the dependent and independent variables,
and the statistical method used in turn. The lack of quantitative testing of
formal deterrence theory has been driven in large part by the difficulties
presented by these issues. These conceptualizations are crucial not only for
the specific task of testing perfect deterrence theory but also the more

general task of making such tests possible and thereby somewhat bridging
the divide between formal theories and quantitative analysis of deterrence.
Case Selection
Case selection has been the biggest obstacle to the empirical analysis of
general deterrence (Huth 1999). The only previous quantitative study focus-
ing on direct general deterrence is by Huth and Russett (1993:63, emphasis
added), who argue that "the population of enduring rivalries in the interna-
tional system includes all dyadic relations in which a dispute created the
possibility of one or both parties resorting to overt military force to achieve
a gain or redress a grievance." According to this line of reasoning, then,
enduring rivalries are the proper cases for the study of general deterrence.
Similarly, Diehl and Goertz focus attention on rivalries, whether or not they
become enduring, and argue that "the rivalry approach provides a solution"
(Diehl and Goertz 2000:91) to problems with deterrence case selection.
According to Diehl and Goertz (2000), a dyad is in a rivalry if they
engage in a militarized interstate dispute. Thus, selecting all rivalries as
cases of general deterrence would capture (by definition) all failures of

general deterrence.4 However, deterrence in dyads that have not fought
would be ignored, which is particularly problematic because those are the
dyads where deterrence has always worked. Furthermore, identification of
the length of a rivalry, and thus the span of general deterrence, requires the
assumption that the rivalry begins either with the first dispute (and thus
deterrence failed when it was attempted for the first time), or at some arbi-
trary length of time before the first dispute and after the last.5
Therefore, the rivalry approach is limited as a path to general deterrence
case selection. However, one can safely assume that every state wishes to
deter attacks against itself--this is the basic rationale for the maintenance of
armed forces (Morgan 1983). This assumption is equivalent to the alliance
portfolio literature's assumption that every state has a defense pact with itself
(Bueno de Mesquita 1975; Signorino and Ritter 1999).6 Hence, the difficult
part of general deterrence case selection is not determining who makes deter-
rent threats (everyone does), but rather what states the threats are directed
against. General deterrent threats are directed against any state that might
consider an attack; these are states that have the opportunity for conflict.
Thus, the key to selecting cases of general deterrence is identifying
opportunity for conflict.7 To identify cases where opportunity exists, I
use the recently developed concept of politically active dyads (Quacken-
bush 2006a). A dyad is politically active "if at least one of the following
characteristics applies: the members of the dyad are contiguous, either
directly or through a colony, one of the dyad members is a global
power, one of the dyad members is a regional power in the region of
the other, one of the dyad members is allied to a state that is contiguous
to the other, one of the dyad members is allied to a global power that is
in a dispute with the other, or one of the dyad members is allied to a
regional power (in the region of the other) that is in a dispute with the
other" (Quackenbush 2006a:43). Quackenbush (2006a) finds that politi-
cally active dyads are able to identify opportunity as a necessary condi-
tion for international conflict, while previous measures of opportunity
4This is, of course, classifying militarized interstate disputes as general deterrence failures.
5This length of time could be assumed to be 10 years, for example. Thus, if two states last disputed in
1900, then the rivalry would continue to 1910. But if general deterrence is needed in 1910, why is it not
needed in 1911 as well?
6In other words, every state threatens to respond if attacked, even though it may not actually carry out
the threat if attacked (just as defense pacts are not always honored when tested).
7Thus, I argue that even "friendly" dyads, such as the United States and Canada, use general deterrence
to regulate their relationship. Each has an incentive to prevent the other from challenging the status quo;
indeed, deterrence has failed between the United States and Canada six times since 1974. Furthermore,
since identifying opportunity for conflict is the key to general deterrence case selection, some may con-
clude that any study that uses politically relevant dyads (or politically active dyads) is an examination of
general deterrence. While there is some merit to that view, most studies of international conflict do not
have the same focus on the credibility and capability of threats that deterrence theory does, so such a
blanket statement is not necessarily valid.
68 S. L. Quackenbush
such as politically relevant dyads and regional dyads are unable to do
so. Thus, we can have confidence that all politically active dyads could
fight if they had the willingness to do so. The goal of deterrence is to
dissuade other states from attacking the deterring state. In other words,
states seek to ensure that other states--those with the opportunity to
attack--do not gain the willingness to attack, and they do this through
deterrence. While other empirically verified causes of war certainly
impact deterrence outcomes, opportunity is the key to general deter-
rence case selection.
Some readers might be concerned that there is no attempt to determine
whether the challenger actually intends to attack, and thus, whether the lack
of an attack can meaningfully be considered general deterrence success.
This issue does not actually pose a problem for the analysis here. The pre-
dictions being tested, from Table 1, are about particular game outcomes, not
a dichotomous measure of deterrence "success" and "failure." Furthermore,
these predictions explicitly cover the case where the challenger has abso-
lutely no interest in attacking. While the three non-status quo outcomes are
essentially different categories of general deterrence failure, the status quo
outcome is not necessarily the result of successful deterrence. For example,
if Challenger prefers Status Quo to Defender Concedes, the only rational
outcome is Status Quo. Although Challenger's decision to not challenge the
status quo in this case is not really "successful deterrence," it is predicted by
perfect deterrence theory.
For the cases that are selected (because they are politically active), I
employ a directed-dyad-year unit of analysis. Within a directed dyad, the
direction of interaction is important; for example, United StatesJapan is
one directed dyad and JapanUnited States is another. The Unilateral
Deterrence Game theoretically differentiates between the roles played by
each state in a dyad, so employing directed-dyads enables empirical differ-
entiation between the states in a dyad as well. Furthermore, since each state
in a politically active dyad has the opportunity for conflict with the other,
each state has an opportunity to challenge the status quo. Therefore, each
state is considered to be a potential challenger. For example, in the United
StatesJapan directed dyad, the United States is Challenger and Japan is
Defender, while in the JapanUnited States directed dyad, Japan is Chal-
lenger and the United States is Defender.
Because most international relations data are based on annual
observations, the year is the time period used for the cross-sectional
time series data analysis conducted here. Therefore, each politically
active directed-dyad-year constitutes an observation. Since general deter-
rence deals with the outbreak, rather than the continuation, of interna-
tional conflict, I eliminate dyad-years marked by a conflict continuing
from the previous year as well as `joiner' dyads. Furthermore, I drop the
directed dyad BA in years with a continuing conflict in the directed
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 69
dyad AB.8 This results in a total of 384,865 politically active directed-
dyad-years for the time period 1816­2000.9
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable for this analysis codes which outcome--Status Quo,
Defender Concedes, Conflict, or Challenger Defeated--of the Unilateral Deter-
rence Game occurred for each observation. These game outcomes are
determined by using version 3 of the militarized interstate dispute (MID)
data set (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). If no dispute was initiated for a
given directed dyad year, the deterrence outcome is coded as Status Quo.
The coding of the other deterrence outcomes is not as straightforward,
but it is possible by utilizing information from both the outcome and the
hostility level of the MID data set. The outcome variable of the MID data
categorizes whether the outcome of a dispute is victory, yield, stalemate,
compromise, released, unclear, or joins ongoing war. More information is
needed, however, in order to capture the deterrence outcome rather than
just the dispute outcome. This additional information is provided by the
hostility level of each state in a MID, which is coded using a five-point
scale. The hostility level indicates whether no militarized action was taken
by that state, a threat to use force was made, a display of force, an actual
use of force, or war.
Dispute initiation is equated to Challenger's defection at node 1 of the
unilateral deterrence game. However, to determine what outcome--Defender
Concedes, Challenger Defeated, or Conflict--is reached following Challenger's
initial defection, it must be determined which player, if any, conceded. Unfor-
tunately, the MID data do not indicate the sequence of events within a dis-
pute. Nonetheless, the outcome and the hostility level variables can be used
to determine what game outcome best corresponds to each dispute.
If both sides use force, or the outcome is "joins ongoing war," the
game outcome is coded Conflict. If mutual use of force did not occur, then
a "victory by A" or "yield by B" is coded as Defender Concedes, whereas a
"victory by B," a "yield by A," or a "released" outcome is coded as Chal-
lenger Defeated.10 If there was no mutual use of force and the outcome was
"unclear," "stalemate," or "compromise," then I compare hostility levels to
determine the outcome.
8For detailed discussions of directed-dyads and joiners, see Bennett and Stam (2000c).
9Because of missing data, the number of observations actually used in the analyses is reduced further.
EUGene, version 3.1 (Bennett and Stam 2000a) was used to construct the data set.
10The released outcome is "identified whenever the seizure of material or personnel culminates with
their release from captivity" (Jones, Bremer, and Singer 1996:180). In game terms, Challenger backed
down in the end. Analyses (not reported here) reveal no significant differences between dropping
released cases or including them.
70 S. L. Quackenbush
If one state escalates to a higher hostility level than the other, it is rea-
sonable to infer that the other state has conceded at some point rather than
to defy by continuing to escalate.11 Thus, if Defender's highest hostility level
is lower than Challenger's, then the outcome is Defender Concedes. But if
Defender escalates to a higher hostility level, the outcome is Challenger
Defeated. Finally, if both states escalate to the same hostility level, the outcome
is coded Conflict.
Variables for the individual outcomes are combined into a single cate-
gorical variable. The resulting variable, called game outcome, is the dependent
variable for the analyses to follow.
Independent Variables
In order to test the predictions summarized in Table 1 for each observation,
player types and credibilities must be measured. This requires measurement
of the utility that each player has for the various outcomes in each dyad
year, a quite difficult task. Indeed, it has never been done with respect to
deterrence theory.
The utilities for each outcome of a deterrence situation can be specified
in terms of the costs and benefits of that outcome. For the two outcomes
following a concession--Defender Concedes and Challenger Defeated--the
utility comes from the size of concession and the cost associated with that
outcome.12 The utility for Conflict is a lottery between receiving one's
demand and conceding the stakes to the other player, weighted by the
probability of victory.13
Following this logic, each player's utility for each outcome can be
expressed in mathematical form. Accordingly, Challenger's utility for each
outcome is operationalized as
11Similar game outcome coding procedures have been employed by Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
(1992) and Bennett and Stam (2000b).
12Following Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992:43), I assume that the cost of conceding "after absorb-
ing a first-strike blow is larger, the greater the power of the rival:" gx
(1 ­ px
).
13I assume that domestic costs (fx
px
) rise with the subjective probability of victory, since "the more
powerful participant in a dyadic relationship bears a greater burden for finding a peaceful resolution of
differences. Domestic populations are assumed to dislike bullying and to punish those who employ vio-
lence if their power should have made them persuasive enough to resolve their disputes without it"
(Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman 1992:46).

and Defender's utilities are operationalized similarly, where 
x

the demand made by state x, px
is the probability x wins, fx
is the domestic
political cost associated with the use of force by x, gx
is the cost borne by x
upon giving in, and wx

Bueno de Mesquita (1975) developed a technique to measure state's
utilities based on their portfolios of alliance commitments. This technique
has been refined over time, and the procedures outlined by Bueno de Mesquita
and Lalman (1992: appendix 1) serve as the baseline for the measurement of
the individual components of equations 1 through 4 used here. States' utili-
ties are measured using the similarity of foreign policy portfolios and risk
attitudes (Bueno de Mesquita 1985). The probabilities of victory are esti-
mated using relative power and estimates of the likelihood of intervention
by third parties.15 In addition, several important changes have been made to
their procedures; details of these changes are provided in the appendix,
along with an explanation of the nonlinear method developed to measure
each state's credibility parameter.
Once the utilities, credibility parameters (pDef
and pCh
), and threshold
values (ct
, cs
, and dn
) are measured, the equilibrium outcome predictions
for each politically active directed dyad-year are made according to the cri-
teria specified in Table 1. This results in four dummy variables: predicted
Status Quo, predicted Defender Concedes, predicted Challenger Defeated,
and predicted Conflict. Each of these variables equals 1 if the corresponding
outcome is predicted in equilibrium for the current observation, and 0
otherwise.
Since not all of the outcome predictions in Table 1 are unique, these
variables are not mutually exclusive. That is, a value of "1" for predicted
Status Quo does not indicate that each of the other variables equals "0." For
those observations where multiple outcomes are predicted in equilibrium,
the variable for each predicted outcome takes the value "1." Therefore, each
of these four variables will be included in the multinomial logit models;
14These utilities for the various outcomes are equivalent to the utilities of some of the outcomes specified
by Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992). Specifically, cSQ

together, they serve as the primary independent variables for the prediction
of game outcomes.
CONTROLS
These independent variables constitute the equilibrium outcome predictions
of perfect deterrence theory. However, a number of alternative explanations
of international behavior exist. Therefore, several control variables, repre-
senting the major foci of recent conflict studies, are used to test the robust-
ness of the results obtained. Some of these variables (particularly relative
power and S score) are components of the utility functions that form the
basis of the equilibrium predictions to be tested. However, it is possible that
these variables exert an independent influence on deterrence outcomes in
addition to their influence on equilibrium predictions. Furthermore, since
these individual components are combined in a different, nonlinear fashion
within the unilateral deterrence game to generate equilibrium predictions,
multicollinearity between the equilibrium predictions and the control vari-
ables is not present.16
BALANCE OF FORCES
There is little dispute that relative power has an important effect on interna-
tional conflict behavior. Most significantly, its importance has been high-
lighted in previous empirical studies of deterrence (for example, Huth 1988).
It is therefore important to control for the effect of the balance of forces in
the present analysis. I use the composite indicator of national capabilities
from the Correlates of War project (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972) to
measure military capabilities for each state. To determine the balance of
forces in a dyad, I create a ratio of Challenger's capabilities to the total capa-
bilities of the dyad. The final variable, balance of forces, ranges from 0
(when Challenger is weak compared to Defender) to 1 (when Challenger is
very strong compared to Defender).
S SCORE
Signorino and Ritter's (1999) S score measures the similarity of foreign policy
positions between states. Although S is an important component of the
measurement of utilities employed here, it is possible that similarity in foreign
policy positions has an independent effect on the outcome of international
interactions. Therefore, I include it as a separate variable, which ranges
16Correlation between outcome predictions and control variables ranges from 0.002 to 0.25.
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 73
from ­1 to 1, with positive values indicating increasingly similar alliance
portfolios and negative values representing increasingly dissimilar portfolios.
DISTANCE
Geographic proximity has repeatedly been found (for example, Bremer
1992) to be an important predictor of international conflict. To control for
the effects of proximity, the distance between states in a dyad is measured.
I take the natural logarithm of the distance between capital cities, except for
the USSR and United States when other cities are included, and states with
land borders are considered to be zero miles apart (Bennett and Stam
2000a).
DEMOCRACY
The democratic peace literature (for example, Russett and Oneal 2001) has
repeatedly found that democracies have seldom if ever fought one another.
Furthermore, Schultz (2001) has found that democracy has an important
effect on credibility. It is therefore important to control for the effect of joint
democracy on deterrence outcomes. To measure democracy, I use the polity
2 variable, which ranges from -10 to 10, of the Polity IV data (Marshall and
Jaggers 2002). I use the minimum democracy score for the dyad as a variable
in the empirical analyses.
PEACE YEARS SPLINE
The final control variable is of more a methodological than substantive char-
acter. Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) have argued that it is important for
studies of conflict using pooled dyadic time series to account for time
dependence within dyads. In other words, while the standard statistical
assumption is that each observation is independent, observations of different
years of the same dyad are not truly independent. I account for time depen-
dence by employing Beck, Katz, and Tucker's method of including peace
years and three cubic spline variables that account for time dependence.
Statistical Method: Multinomial Logit
Because the dependent variable, game outcome, has more than two unor-
dered categories, the appropriate statistical method to use is multinomial
logit. Since there are four categories, three equations are estimated. These
equations independently estimate the effects of the independent variables
on producing outcomes Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict
relative to the Status Quo.
74 S. L. Quackenbush
Two alternative models are available for empirical analysis of the multi-
ple, unordered categories of the dependent variable employed here. The
first of these is strategic probit, which Signorino and Tarar (2006) utilized for
a unified theory and test of extended immediate deterrence. Strategic probit
provides a method for integrating the theoretical and empirical models,
while accounting for nonmonotonic influences of independent variables
resulting from strategic interaction (Signorino 1999, 2003). Thus, strategic
probit would provide an excellent avenue for empirically determining the
impact of factors such as balance of forces, arms races, and domestic conflict
on general deterrence. However, since strategic probit uses a different solu-
tion concept (quantal response equilibrium vs. perfect Bayesian equilibrium)
and different information conditions (complete vs. incomplete information)
than perfect deterrence theory, an empirical analysis using strategic probit
would not be a test of perfect deterrence theory's equilibrium predictions,
which is the purpose of this paper.
The second alternative would be a nested logit model. Nested logit
models are models of a decision process that is made in stages in which the
decisions at later stages are limited by those made in earlier stages. This
seems to fit nicely with the game structure examined here, where each
node of the Unilateral Deterrence Game would correspond to a different
stage of the nested logit model. Unfortunately, nested logit is also not
appropriate here, for two primary reasons. First, as with the strategic probit,
it would not provide a test of the equilibrium predictions of perfect deter-
rence theory. Secondly, nested logit models are unable to account for strate-
gic interaction between multiple decisionmakers, and are thus only
appropriate for analyses of a single decisionmaker's nested decisions
(Signorino 2003).
While the multinomial logit model is also a decision model that does
not account for strategic interaction, that does not pose a problem for this
analysis. Strategic interaction between Challenger and Defender is taken
into account through perfect deterrence theory, which makes equilibrium
outcome predictions prior to the empirical analysis. Thus, the theory is
the "decisionmaker" (deciding which outcome(s) is predicted for each
observation), and the purpose of this analysis is to test how well the theory
makes those decisions.
RESULTS
I begin testing the equilibrium predictions of perfect deterrence theory out-
lined in Table 1 through a base model--incorporating only the four outcome
prediction variables and the peace years spline variables--shown in Table 2.
This model fits the data significantly better than a model including only the
constant term.
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 75
Beginning with predicted Status Quo, one can see that the coefficient
for this variable is insignificant for all but the Conflict equation. This indi-
cates that predicting the status quo has no significant impact on the occur-
rence of Defender Concedes or Challenger Defeated, while it increases the
probability of Conflict. This latter result is quite surprising; if robust, this
finding would be problematic for the theory.
The impact of each of the non-status quo outcome predictions on the
occurrence of game outcomes is in line with expectations. The prediction of
Defender Concedes makes Defender Concedes significantly more likely to
occur, and significantly increases the probability of Challenger Defeated and
Conflict. Similarly, predicted Challenger Defeated makes all non-status quo
outcomes, most importantly Challenger Defeated, more likely to occur. The
prediction of Conflict also has a significant impact in each equation. In
other words, if Conflict is predicted, all non-status quo outcomes (most
importantly, Conflict) are more likely to occur.
To examine the robustness of these results against alternative explanations,
the full multinomial logit model was run including the control variables. The
full model, shown in Table 3, produces a highly significant fit to the data.
The results of the full model indicate that the predictions of perfect deter-
rence theory are quite robust.
Unlike the base model, predicted Status Quo is found to reduce the
probability of any non-status quo outcome, although the coefficient for the
Challenger Defeated equation is not significant. Thus, although the results
for this variable were somewhat contrary to expectations in the base model,
after other factors are controlled for the expected pattern emerges.

76 S. L. Quackenbush
The other key variables continue to be positive and significant across
all three equations. Therefore, perfect deterrence theory's predictions of Status
Quo, Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict are all strongly
supported by the empirical record, and these predictions are robust against
alternative explanations.
The results for the control variables are mostly in line with previously
established expectations. The balance of forces has a positive coefficient
throughout, although it is not significant for the Challenger Defeated equa-
tion. Distance, democracy, and peace years all reduce the probability of
each non-status quo outcome, although democracy is surprisingly not sig-
nificant for the Challenger Defeated equation. The S score only has a signif-
icant impact on Challenger Defeated, which is in the expected negative
direction.
These results for the prediction of game outcomes are more easily
understood through examination of predicted probabilities. The value for
the predicted outcome is set to 1, the values for the other outcome predic-
tions is set to 0, and the control variables are set to their means.

Table 4 shows the impact of outcome predictions on the predicted
probabilities of outcomes. To ease interpretation, the Status Quo column of
Table 4 shows the predicted probability of each outcome given a prediction
of Status Quo. The other columns show the change in the predicted proba-
bility of a given outcome when a non-status quo outcome is predicted. For
example, predicting Defender Concedes decreases the probability of Status
Quo by 0.19%, increases the probability of Defender Concedes by 85.71%,
and increases the probability of Challenger Defeated and Conflict by
50.00% each.
Prediction of any non-status quo outcome reduces the probability of
the Status Quo, although not by the largest of margins. The prediction of a
concession by Defender greatly increases the probability of a Defender Con-
cedes outcome (an increase of over 85%), the prediction of a defeat for
Challenger greatly increases the probability of Challenger Defeated (an
increase of 300%), and the prediction of Conflict has a large impact on the
probability of Conflict (an increase of 250%). Each of these results is in line
with expectations.
Astute readers will note that although predictions of Defender Concedes
and Conflict have their largest impact on the appropriate outcome, they also
greatly increase the probability of other non-status quo outcomes. This
should actually be expected, since each of the equations is a comparison
between a non-status quo outcome and the status quo. When a non-status
quo outcome is predicted, it should make the status quo less likely to occur.
If the status quo is less likely, then all non-status quo outcomes (even those
not specifically predicted) are more likely.17
17Thus, the key results are the direction and significance of the outcome predictions on those outcomes
(e.g., of predicted Defender Concedes in the Defender Concedes equation). Note that each of these coef-
ficients is positive and highly significant.

78 S. L. Quackenbush
Nonetheless, prediction of Challenger Defeated has a larger impact on
the Defender Concedes and Conflict outcomes than on the Challenger
Defeated outcome. This indicates that the model has some difficulty in dif-
ferentiating between concessions by Challenger and Defender. However,
Wald tests for combining outcomes confirm that the model is able to distin-
guish between each of the outcomes, again significant at the <0.0001 level.
A further test of the model's empirical fit is provided by block tests of
statistical significance, as shown in Table 5. These tests clearly demonstrate
that the full model provides a better fit than the null model. Furthermore,
removing any single equilibrium prediction produces a significantly worse
fit to the data than the full model, as does removing the set of all four equilib-
rium predictions. Thus, we can have confidence that each outcome prediction
of perfect deterrence theory provides an important contribution to explain-
ing the dynamics of deterrence.
One unusual feature of this test of perfect deterrence theory is that the
theory does not provide unique outcome predictions in most cases; rather,
because of multiple equilibria, two or three different outcomes are possible
in many observations. Table 6 helps to clarify the empirical implications of

Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 79
these nonexclusive equilibrium predictions. Each row shows the number of
observations that correspond to each group of predictions from Table 1,
separated by the outcome actually observed. Thus, for example, there are
21,563 observations where the predicted outcome is either Status Quo or
Defender Concedes; of these, 21,391 actually result in the status quo, and a
further 110 result in a concession by Defender, for a total accuracy rate of
99.71%. One can see that each of the predictions is about 99% accurate,
except for the unique predictions of Defender Concedes and Conflict, which
are less than 1% accurate.
Clearly, the accuracy of these latter predictions is problematic. As
Table 1 makes clear, these unique predictions of Defender Concedes or
Conflict occur when Challenger prefers Conflict to Status Quo. In that
case, Challenger's only rational course of action is to challenge the status
quo, leading to one of those outcomes. This is the prediction of perfect
deterrence theory; however, it must also be the prediction of any theory,
since that is the only logical result of those preferences. This result is
clearly a product of error in the measurement of utilities. For instance, despite
the maintenance of the status quo throughout, Conflict is the predicted
outcome for the United StatesCanada dyad for the period 1920­1941,
because throughout, the United States is measured to prefer Conflict to
the Status Quo. While the United States almost certainly did not truly have
that preference, it is the best estimate produced by the measurement of
utilities employed here, based on the method pioneered by Bueno de
Mesquita and Lalman (1992). Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992:298)
acknowledge that the procedures they developed "may introduce consid-
erable measurement error," concluding that this "suppresses . . . our
results." Hence, future research should seek to improve our measurement
of utilities; once that is done, one would expect support for perfect deter-
rence theory to be even stronger.
Since non-status quo outcomes are rare events, one could achieve 99%
accuracy by simply predicting the Status Quo for every observation. However,
in so doing, one would achieve 0% accuracy of non-status quo predictions.
As one can see from Table 6, the non-status quo predictions here are about
49 percent accurate (with the accuracy of individual predictions between 14
and 82 percent accurate). Thus, perfect deterrence theory provides a pro-
portional reduction in the error of non-status quo predictions of 20 percent.
Although improvement is always possible, these results nonetheless support
perfect deterrence theory.
These results for perfect deterrence theory can be put in perspective
by comparing them with an alternative theory of international conflict.
Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) constructed the International Inter-
action Game to analyze relations between states. Although this is not the
way they present it, theirs is essentially a theory of general deterrence.
Furthermore, it has been extensively tested by Bennett and Stam (2000b) in
80 S. L. Quackenbush
a multinomial logit analysis quite similar to that conducted here. Therefore,
it is useful to compare the results found here to the results obtained by
Bennett and Stam.
Only five outcomes emerge as equilibrium predictions of the Interna-
tional Interaction Game: status quo, acquiescence by A, acquiescence by B,
negotiation, and war. However, six different outcomes of the IIG--status
quo, acquiescence by B, negotiation, capitulation by A, capitulation by B,
and war--are realized. Thus, one equilibrium prediction (acquiescence by A)
never occurs in reality, and two other outcomes that do occur (capitulation
by A and capitulation by B) are never predicted in equilibrium. In the Uni-
lateral Deterrence Game, however, all four possible outcomes occur in both
predictions and the historical record.
In addition, the multinomial logit results obtained here provide much
stronger support for perfect deterrence theory than the support Bennett and
Stam (2000b) found for the International Interaction Game. As Bennett and
Stam (2000b:473) note, only two of the equilibrium predictions "are helping
to differentiate non-status quo outcomes from the status quo." Compare this
to the Unilateral Deterrence Game, where each outcome prediction helps to
differentiate between the status quo and non-status quo outcomes. If perfect
deterrence theory is more consistent with the empirical record than "one of
the most important theories of international conflict" (Bennett and Stam
2000b:451), then one must take note.
CONCLUSIONS
A divide exists in the literature between formal theories and quantitative
analyses of deterrence, largely because formal theories of general deter-
rence have never been subjected to direct empirical testing. This paper has
sought to bridge this divide in two ways.
First was to develop the conceptualization and procedures to make
such direct empirical testing possible. Key conceptualizations include case
selection for direct general deterrence--I argue that identifying opportunity
for conflict is the key. In addition, procedures to measure the actors' utilities
for the different outcomes were developed. Also, since incomplete informa-
tion equilibria depend on each state's estimate of the opponent's credibility,
a nonlinear transformation technique was developed to estimate the credi-
bility parameters.
Using these procedures, I have endeavored to fill a large void in the lit-
erature by testing perfect deterrence theory, focused on the theory's
Unilateral Deterrence Game with incomplete information. I used multino-
mial logit methods to examine the prediction of particular game outcomes.
The results indicate that the theory is well supported by the historical
record.
Testing Perfect Deterrence Theory 81
The results of this research have important policy implications as well.
The policy recommendations of perfect deterrence theory and classical
deterrence theory are diametrically opposed on many issues (Zagare 2004).
For example, classical deterrence theory argues that national missile defense
undermines the stability of deterrence (for example, Powell 2003), whereas
an application of perfect deterrence theory demonstrates that national missile
defense enhances deterrence stability (Quackenbush 2006b). However, policy
discussions in academia and government are generally based on classical
deterrence theory. Given its strong empirical support, coupled with logical
and empirical limitations of classical deterrence theory (Zagare 1996),
perfect deterrence theory would provide a much better basis for analyzing
various aspects of national security policy. This could be done by applying
perfect deterrence theory to case studies of particular events (for example,
the analysis of the war in Kosovo by Quackenbush and Zagare 2006) or to
the analysis of particular policy issues (for example, the analysis of national
missile defense by Quackenbush 2006b).
In addition, perfect deterrence theory provides a natural basis for further
empirical research on the dynamics of deterrence. First, future research
focused on improving measurement of utilities would be particularly
pertinent. Also, direct tests of further formal theories--not only theories of
deterrence--are of vital importance for improving our understanding of
international interactions. In addition, this analysis was focused on only one
of the theory's three core models, applied across all observations. Thus, this
analysis may have underestimated the theory's explanatory power. One
avenue for future research is therefore to conduct a more nuanced test incor-
porating models of mutual and extended deterrence. And finally, further the-
oretical expansions of perfect deterrence theory--such as an incorporation
of more nuanced bargaining elements like endogenous stakes--would
greatly improve our understanding of the dynamics of deterrence.

Unilateral Deterrence Game Equilibria
Zagare and Kilgour (2000) model incomplete information by allowing each
player to be uncertain of the other player's type. Challenger estimates the
probability that Defender is Hard, pDef
, and Defender estimates the proba-
bility that Challenger is Hard, pCh
(where 0 < p < 1 in each case). They find
four major types of perfect Bayesian equilibria. Each equilibrium specifies
values for four important parameters: xH
(xS
) = probability that a Hard (Soft)
Challenger defects at node 1, and yH
(yS
) = probability that a Hard (Soft)
Defender defies at node 2. Certain Deterrence equilibria exist where [xH

; Attack equilibria exist
where [xH
, xS
; yH
, yS
] = [1, 1; 1, 0] when pDef
< cs
and pCh
 dn
. The region of
existence for each equilibrium is defined by a combination of three critical
points. These critical points, defined below, are necessary to empirically
generate the equilibrium predictions tested here:
Measurement Details
Three important changes are made here to Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's
measurement procedures. First, I use Signorino and Ritter's (1999) measure of
foreign policy similarity, S, as the basic building block for these measurements
of utility. Secondly, I constrain the political cost term to be non-negative to
prevent this "cost" term from providing an artificial boost to the utility for
Conflict. Therefore, I use the equation .
The third important change in Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's mea-
surement techniques made here deals with the costs borne by a state in giving
in (gx
) compared to the costs borne by a state in conflict (wx
). While Bueno
de Mesquita and Lalman simply assume that gx
= wx
= 1, this sets the cost of
backing down equal to the cost of fighting. Unfortunately, this assumption
makes Conflict preferred to concession in almost all circumstances. In other

words, if it is assumed that gx
= wx
, then almost all possible threats are cred-
ible. Clearly this is a problem; states often prefer to back down rather than
fight, since the costs borne by a state in giving in are generally less than the
costs associated with conflict. Therefore, it is assumed here that gx
= 0.25
and wx
= 1.
With these modifications to the procedures laid out by Bueno de Mesquita
and Lalman (1992), each state's utilities for each outcome are measured. The
individual components of these utilities are calculated using EUGene (Bennett
and Stam 2000a). These raw utility values (which can range from -3 to 2) are
normalized to the interval from 0 to 1.
Since I am testing predictions based on incomplete information condi-
tions where player types are not common knowledge, Challenger's estimate
of the probability that Defender is Hard (pDef
) and Defender's estimate of
Challenger's type (pCh
) are needed. I develop a nonlinear transformation of
the difference between the utility for conflict and a concession, which I call
U = U(conflict) ­ U(back down), to the interval between 0 and 1 while
also accounting for the impact of risk propensity. These credibility estimates
for each player are measured as
