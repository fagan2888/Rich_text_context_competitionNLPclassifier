Validity of Self-rated Health Finch et al.
Validity of Self-rated Health among Latino(a)s
Brian Karl Finch,1 Robert A. Hummer,2 Maureen Reindl,2 and William A. Vega3
The authors investigated whether self-rated health (SRH) had differential mortality risks for Latino(a) adults of
various acculturation statuses living in the United States. They used cumulative National Health Interview Survey
data from 1989 to 1994 (n = 37,713) linked with the National Health Interview Survey Multiple Cause of Death data
files (1,364 deaths) that match records from the National Death Index through 1997.The authors specified survival
models to estimate the effect of SRH on mortality and further stratified their model by birth and duration in the
United States as proxies for acculturation. These estimates were compared across strata. Poor SRH was found to
be a weaker predictor of subsequent mortality risk among the less acculturated, although the overall risk among
the aggregated sample is similar to the risk reported in previous studies. The relation between poor SRH and
mortality risk increases with United States acculturation among Latinos. While poor SRH was significantly
associated with short-term mortality among the least acculturated, this association did not persist beyond 2-year
mortality risk. Health researchers wishing to use SRH to assess the physical health of multiethnic populations
should at least control for levels of acculturation among respondents. Am J Epidemiol 2002;155:755­9.

The validity of self-rated health (SRH) measures, in terms
of their predictive import for mortality risk, has been estab-
lished in multiple studies. A well-cited review concludes
that SRH is an independent predictor of mortality, above and
beyond physician assessments of health (1). Global SRH
measures generally include a question such as "How would
you rate your overall health?" and offer five response cate-
gories that range from excellent to poor. SRH measures are
often dichotomized as fair/poor versus all other categories
since the poor/fair categories represent expressions of health
distress and/or the presence of disease; a rating of fair/poor
also represents a heightened mortality risk.
Responses to SRH may vary depending on the race/
ethnicity of the person being interviewed, however. For
example, Latinos may somatize their emotional/mental
health into physical health constructs (2) such as SRH.
Somatization in this regard is defined as the tendency to pre-
sent health complaints that are indicative of personal or
social problems. Because of this tendency, Latino immi-
grants rate themselves in poorer health than do native-born
Latinos; several studies have confirmed this result (3­5).
This finding is a troubling anomaly amidst burgeoning
evidence of an inverse relation between acculturation and
health (5). Numerous studies have demonstrated that higher
levels of acculturation among immigrant Latinos are posi-
tively related to the following health outcomes: adult mor-
tality (6­10), psychiatric disorders (11, 12), infant mortality
(13), psychologic distress (14), deleterious health behaviors
(15), substance use (16), low birth weight (17, 18), and risk
for several nonfatal morbidities (19). Therefore, what
should we make of the apparent anomalous relation between
SRH and acculturation? After all, a growing Latino popula-
tion in the United States, largely due to increased immigra-
tion, has important implications for the ability of health
researchers to quickly and easily compare the health status
of multiethnic populations in the United States through the
use of SRH questions.
Following McGee et al. (20), we sought to assess the
validity of SRH for mortality risk by using a sample of
Latino adults who were characterized as having different
levels of acculturation to US society. Our primary research
question was, "Are subsequent mortality risks among
Latinos who rate themselves in fair/poor health moderated
by levels of acculturation?"
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data set
We utilized a unique data set that aggregates multiple
years (1989­1994) of the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) (21) and is linked to the NHIS: Multiple Cause of
Death (22) data set for 1989­1997. Adult respondents in
756 Finch et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 155, No. 8, 2002
each year of the NHIS were searched for in the National
Death Index and matched according to a complex scoring
algorithm. Potential matches were classified according to
the strength of the match, and we utilize the match that is
recommended by National Center for Health Statistics and
has been estimated to classify more than 97 percent of the
subjects correctly.
We selected only the subsample of respondents who self-
identified as Latino/Hispanic from each year of the NHIS;
75 percent of respondents live in California, Texas, New
York, Florida, Illinois, Arizona, and New Jersey. Although
we excluded those for whom a self-rating of health is miss-
ing (n  160), we utilized dummy variables for each covari-
ate that controlled for missing data to minimize nonresponse
bias. Our final sample size included 37,713 Latino adults
who were age 18 years or older at the time of the survey
between 1989 and 1994. Of the Latino respondents to the
NHIS between these years, 1,364 (3.6 percent) had died as
of the 1997 matching with the National Death Index.
Measures
Our key predictor variable was SRH, and our key interest
was in the estimated magnitude of this variable on mortality
risk across respondents of varying acculturation status. We
treated SRH as a dichotomous measure, distinguishing
between those who rate themselves in fair/poor health ver-
sus all others (excellent/very good/good). Since the lan-
guage of the survey was not available, we used a proxy for
acculturation from duration of stay in the United States; this
variable was categorized into three strata, including
1) recent immigrant, less than 10 years in the United States
(n  7,327; 156 deaths); 2) long-term immigrant, 10 years
or more in the United States (n  12,738; 564 deaths); and
3) born in the United States (n  17,648; 644 deaths). We
also included dummy variables for national origin, compris-
ing Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central/
South Americans, and other Latinos.
Other demographic variables included age, sex, and mar-
ital status. Socioeconomic controls included education,
annual family income, and employment status. Since these
variables came from a cross-sectional survey, they were
measured at the time of the baseline survey only and were
time invariant.
Methodology
We first used weighted Cox proportional hazards models
(23) to estimate the effects of SRH on mortality risk. Our
modeling strategy was to look first at the overall risk of
mortality by SRH status among our entire Latino sample
and then to stratify this relation according to birth/duration
in the United States. We also estimated piecewise constant
hazard models (23), which served two purposes. First,
piecewise constants allowed us to account better for hetero-
geneity of hazards over time (i.e., nonproportionality), and
second, piecewise constant models allowed us to determine
whether SRH ratings had a short- or long-term predictive
value for mortality risk.
RESULTS
We present the results of our proportional hazards models
as hazard ratios in tables 1 and 2; 95 percent confidence
intervals directly follow the hazard ratios.
Table 1 presents the models, stratified by birth/duration in
the United States. The overall mortality risk (right-hand col-
umn) for rating oneself in fair/poor health relative to better
health was nearly twofold (hazard ratio  1.80) over the
subsequent follow-up period (net of covariates). Our strati-
fied models show a monotonic increase of SRH on mortal-
ity risk as level of acculturation increases. That is, the mor-
tality risk of fair/poor SRH for recent immigrants is 1.28
times that of those who rate themselves in better health, but
is statistically nonsignificant. Among long-term immigrants,
fair/poor SRH is associated with a risk of dying that is 1.74
times that of those who rate themselves in better health; this
risk rises to 2.04 among native-born Latinos.
We performed a formal chi-squared check of the propor-
tionality assumption for SRH and mortality risk. Although
proportionality was confirmed with 95 percent statistical
confidence among immigrants, the hazard ratios among the
native born begin to converge over the course of the follow-
up period. Thus, we specified piecewise-constant hazard
models to assess differential mortality risk over several dif-
ferent time periods. We ran four separate regression models
that specify two constants for the following time periods:
model 1, 0­24 and 25­108 months; model 2, 0­36 and
37­108 months; model 3, 0­48 and 49­108 months; and
model 4, 0­60 and 61­108 months. Rather than present the
full results for each of these models, we present only the
hazard ratios (table 2) for each acculturation level, control-
ling for the full set of social and demographic factors.
In model 1 (table 2), for example, a fair/poor rating of
health is associated with a two and a half-fold or higher mor-
tality risk for 2-year mortality follow-up (0­24 months)
among all acculturation groups. However, although poor
SRH is predictive of mortality beyond 2 years for native-
born and long-term immigrant respondents, it is not predic-
tive for recent immigrants (model 1, 25­108 months). A
similar pattern emerges when examining different periods of
follow-up risk. That is, fair/poor SRH is predictive of mor-
tality only for a very short period of risk (i.e., less than 2
years) among recent immigrants and is not a statistically sig-
nificant predictor for any period of time beyond that. On the
other hand, for both long-term immigrants and native-born
respondents, fair/poor SRH is predictive of mortality risk for
a much longer time period. However, the strength of this
association diminishes over time such that fair/poor SRH is
no longer predictive of mortality risk after an initial 5-year
observation period.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicated that SRH has limitations in predict-
ing mortality risk among Latinos. A previous study has
shown that all race/ethnic groups exhibit similar mortality
risks for fair/poor SRH (20); we observe a similar risk
among the pooled sample of Latinos in our study. However,
Validity of Self-rated Health 757
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 155, No. 8, 2002
our study indicates that these cross-ethnic comparisons may
not be valid when immigrants make up a large portion of
study samples. More specifically, although fair/poor SRH
was associated with short-term mortality risk among those
with low levels of acculturation, this rating was not predic-
tive of long-term mortality risk (i.e., after 2 years). On the
other hand, as levels of acculturation increase among
Latinos, fair/poor SRH has stronger effects and longer-
lasting predictive power for subsequent mortality risk. That
is, the predictive power of SRH among the more accultur-
ated should more closely match those of non-Hispanic
White and non-Hispanic Black respondents who are born in
the United States.
As a cautionary note, differential rates of return migration

(by acculturation) could potentially bias the baseline mor-
tality estimates, although these estimates are not of direct
concern for our study. However, if those who rate them-
selves in fair/poor health are lost to follow-up because of
return migration to Mexico, at higher rates than those who
rate themselves in good health, then our results may be
affected by this bias.
Our findings imply that the use of SRH for cross-ethnic
comparisons of physical health may be problematic.
Demographically, since foreign-born respondents make up
greater percentages of survey samples (because they are
becoming a greater proportion of the US population), the
ability to quickly assess health for all subjects equally
through the use of SRH becomes more problematic.
Therefore, it is very important to control for levels of accul-
turation within and between groups for whom comparisons
are being made so that potentially artifactual components of
SRH can be factored out.
