ABSTRACT
Objective To observe the effect of electronic medical
record (EMR) system sophistication on preventive
women's healthcare.
Materials and Methods Providers in the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), 2007­8,
were included if they had at least one visit by a woman
at least 21 years old. Based on 16 questions from
NAMCS, the level of a provider's EMR system
sophistication was classified as non-existent, minimal,
basic, or fully functional. A two-stage residual-inclusion
method was used with ordered probit regression to
model the level of EMR system sophistication, and
outcome-specific Poisson regressions to predict the
number of examinations or tests ordered or performed.
Results Across the providers, 29.23%, 49.34%, 15.97%,
and 5.46% had no, minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR
systems, respectively. The breast examination rate was
20.27%, 34.96%, 37.21%, and 44.98% for providers
without or with minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR
systems, respectively. For breast examinations, pelvic
examinations, Pap tests, chlamydia tests, cholesterol tests,
mammograms, and bone mineral density (BMD) tests, an
EMR system increased the number of these tests and
examinations. Furthermore, the level of sophistication
increased the number of breast examinations and Pap,
chlamydia, cholesterol, and BMD tests.
Discussion The use of advanced EMR systems in
obstetrics and gynecology was limited. Given the positive
results of this study, specialists in women's health should
consider investing in more sophisticated systems.
Conclusions The presence of an EMR system has a
positive impact on preventive women's healthcare; the
more functions that the system has, the greater the number
of examinations and tests given or prescribed.
INTRODUCTION
One of the most innovative new technologies in
healthcare is the electronic medical record (EMR)
system. In 2006, 46% of hospital emergency depart-
ments (EDs), 29% of hospital outpatient depart-
ments, and 29% of office-based physicians reported
using EMR systems.1 By 2008, the use of EMR
systems by office-based physicians, the focus of the
current study, had increased but was still less than
50%.2 EMR systems may have the potential to
prevent adverse drug events, organize the process of
patient care, improve care itself, and decrease
healthcare costs by preventing ED visits and hospi-
talizations. Highly integrated EMR systems such as
EpicCare are used for decision support, order sets,
as well as generating reports and documentation.3
A rich literature has investigated the relationship
between features of these systems and health
outcomes. Although not all results are positive,4
much research has shown the value of an EMR
system in improving physicians' behavior and per-
formance in drug prescribing, dosing, avoiding
medication errors, and managing chronic condi-
tions.5 6 EMR systems are designed to aid practi-
tioners working with patients who require complex
coordination of care such as in the cardiovascular
therapeutic area. Previous research has documented
the effectiveness of EMR systems in lipid and chol-
esterol management,7 encouraging the adoption of
EMR systems among cardiologists.8
In the area of women's health, one study
reported that physician compliance in providing
preventive care improved when computer remin-
ders for mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap) tests,
and fecal occult blood testing were provided.9
Electronic reminders for mammography screenings
were also reported to be useful in providing early
preventive care to women with a high risk of
breast cancer.10 A randomized trial reported that
patient-specific postfracture advice, for patients
with osteoporosis, to the medical care provider by
way of an EMR system reminder, significantly
increased bone mineral density (BMD) measure-
ment and medication, and was nine times more
effective than usual care.11
Most of the literature to date has reported on
relationships between individual system features
and health outcomes in small-scale settings, limit-
ing interested providers' ability to generalize
the results. There are a few exceptions. According
to an EMR report prepared by the Healthcare
Information and Management Systems Society, an
increase in the sophistication of an EMR system led
to higher healthcare quality indicator scores as
developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality.12 Moreover, Furakawa13 showed that a
fully functional EMR system, one with more than
basic functionality, realized an improvement in ED
efficiency. However, it is unknown whether EMR
system sophistication will also generate better care
for patients seeing office-based physicians for pre-
ventive healthcare. Using a national database and
advanced statistical techniques, this study investi-
gated the relationship between the level of EMR
system sophistication and 11 different health out-
comes in the area of preventive healthcare for
women across the USA over a 2-year period.
METHODS
Data source
The database used was the publicly available
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NAMCS) for the years 2007 and 2008. The

Research and Applications
NAMCS contains survey data collected by the National Center
of Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, at the individual patient visit level. The survey
sample covers US non-federally employed physicians who are
primarily engaged in office-based patient care as classified by the
American Medical Association or the American Osteopathic
Association. The NAMCS utilizes a multistage probability
design for selection of its sample that involves physician prac-
tices within primary sample units and then patient visits within
practices. The first-stage sampling involves primary sample
units composed of counties, groups of counties, and county
equivalents. The second-stage sample consists of a probability
sample of practising physicians classified by their specialties.
The final stage consists of patient visits selected through sys-
tematic random selection. Physicians, their staff, or field agents
from the US Bureau of the Census performed the actual data
collection. The NAMCS data generate national estimates by
using either visit or provider weights. At the time of this study,
the most recent data available were from 2007 and 2008. The
data were pooled over the 2 years. Data for the dependent vari-
ables described below were obtained from responses to `yes/no'
questions regarding whether a particular test or service was
ordered or provided during a visit. The NAMCS database is
de-identified and publicly accessible, and, therefore, was exempt
from review by the institutional review board at the University
of Cincinnati.
Visit selection
A visit was selected if it was for a woman aged 21 years or
older, and a provider was included if he or she had at least one
visit by a woman aged 21 years or older. According to the
guidelines for preventive women's healthcare, developed by the
Office on Women's Health, specific tests and examinations
recommended depend on the age of the patient. Although a
few tests (such as for chlamydia) are recommended for women
younger than 21 years, the majority of preventive services are
for women aged 21 years or older.14
Dependent variables
Eleven dependent variables, constructed at the provider level
after pooling data from 2007 and 2008, were selected based on
the guidelines issued by the Office on Women's Health,14 and
data availability:
1. Number of breast examinations ordered or provided;
2. Number of pelvic examinations ordered or provided;
3. Number of Pap tests ordered or provided;
4. Number of chlamydia tests ordered or provided;
5. Number of cholesterol tests ordered or provided;
6. Number of blood pressure (BP) tests ordered or provided;
7. Number of mammography tests ordered or provided;
8. Number of BMD imaging tests ordered or provided;
9. Number of seasonal flu vaccinations ordered or provided;
10. Number of visits including education on nutrition and
diet;
11. Number of visits including education on exercise.
Independent variables
The key independent variable was the level of EMR system
sophistication. In 2007 and 2008, the NAMCS included 16
`yes/no' questions (primary questions plus follow-up ques-
tions) on the provider's EMR system relating to 16 different
features of the system. Based on these questions, the level of
sophistication of the system was categorized as one of the fol-
lowing: no EMR system; minimal EMR system; basic EMR
system; or fully functional EMR system, consistent with the
four-way classification developed by health-information
experts.15 The highest frequencies were found for the following
four functions: patient demographics; laboratory results;
imaging results; and clinical notes (see figure 1). We considered
them basic functions for the purposes of the analysis. If a
system had one to three of these functions, we classified it as a
minimal system. Whereas, in Furukawa,13 computerized orders
for tests and prescriptions were also considered to be basic
functions for EDs, their frequencies were sufficiently lower
than the other four for physician offices that they were consid-
ered more advanced features in this study's context. To be con-
sidered a basic system, the system had to have all four of the
basic functions. The most frequently observed advanced fea-
tures of basic systems were orders for prescriptions, orders for
tests, out of range levels highlighted on laboratory results, and
medical history/follow-up notes accompanying clinical notes. A
fully functional EMR system had at least the four basic func-
tions as well as at least 10 additional functions, bringing func-
tionality up to between 14 and 16 functions. Each of the first
14 functions (all but public health reporting and electronic
notification) was a feature of at least 90% of all fully functional
systems, with the four basic functions a part of 100% of those
systems.
Because of the potential for endogeneity bias (progressive
providers might provide both fully functional EMR systems
and high-quality women's preventive healthcare), we selected
two instrumental variables as independent variables: (1)

whether the EMR system included public health reporting but
did not send electronic disease notifications, and (2) whether
the EMR system included both public health reporting and
electronic disease notifications. These two instrumental vari-
ables were used by Furukawa13 and were appealing because of
their expected correlation with EMR system sophistication but
not with women's health outcomes. Additional instrumental
variables were also considered, but ultimately rejected due to
reduction in model goodness of fit.
Covariates included both provider and patient characteristics.
Whereas the provider variables were included in both first and
second-stage regressions (discussed below), patient characteris-
tics were included only in the second stage. Provider character-
istics included type of office setting (private practice, clinic,
community health center, health maintenance organization
(HMO), and so forth); solo or group practice; practice owner-
ship (physician group, hospital, healthcare corporation, etc);
whether laboratory testing was performed at the office; phys-
ician specialty (general and family practice, internal medicine,
urology, psychiatry, etc); region of the country (northeast,
midwest, south, or west); and location (in a metropolitan stat-
istical area or not). Patient characteristics included the total
number of visits by women; the percentage of patients falling
in different age groups (younger than 40, 40­49, and 50 years
and older), race (white, African American, Asian, and other),
income categories, and payer (Medicaid, Medicare, private
insurance or other) categories.
Statistical analyses
First, we described the distribution of EMR system types (no
EMR, minimal, basic, or fully functional) overall as well as
stratified by provider characteristics. We then described the
frequency and rates of the 11 preventive women's healthcare
measures both overall and across the four EMR system types.
Rates were calculated by dividing the frequencies of preventive
measures by the estimated number of women visiting providers
with different levels of EMR sophistication.
In the first stage of a two-stage residual-inclusion model, an
ordered probit regression was estimated to model the level of
EMR system sophistication. Independent variables included the
provider covariates discussed above along with the two instru-
mental variables. Over-identification tests were conducted to
confirm the exogeneity of the latter variables. Estimated mar-
ginal probabilities showed the estimated rise or fall in the prob-
ability of the EMR system's being non-existent, minimal, basic,
or fully functional.
The second stage involved 11 separate Poisson regressions--
one for each of the women's healthcare measures listed above.
For these regressions, the independent variables included pro-
vider characteristics, patient characteristics, three binary vari-
ables indicating minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR
system (with `no EMR system' as the reference category), and
the residuals from the first regression if their estimated coeffi-
cient in the second stage was statistically significant at the 5%
level (as it was in the BP regression only).
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 11. They
were conducted using the survey (svy) set in STATA that takes
into account the complex survey design of NAMCS and allows
the use of weights, strata, and clusters.

fully functional system. Across practice types (some results not
shown), HMOs were the most advanced, with 74.68% of
HMO providers having either a basic or fully functional
system. Group practices, relative to solo practices, had a distri-
bution favoring higher levels of sophistication. Similarly, provi-
ders with laboratory testing capability had a distribution
favoring higher levels of sophistication relative to those
without. The three physician specialties (general and family
practice, internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) expected
to provide the most preventive healthcare to women had
sophistication distributions similar to the all-provider distribu-
tion. In general and family practice, there was a slightly higher
level of sophistication, with 7.07% of providers working with
fully functional systems, and 18.40% with basic systems (vs
5.46% and 15.97%, respectively, for providers overall). In obste-
trics and gynecology, 18.51% of practices had basic systems,
although only 5.15% worked with fully functional EMR
systems. Compared to the women's health specialties, cardio-
vascular disease specialists and urologists had a much higher
percentage of basic plus fully functional systems, while psy-
chiatrists and dermatologists had much lower percentages of
more sophisticated systems (results not shown). The west, fol-
lowed by the midwest, had the highest percentages of basic
and fully functional systems. Little difference in EMR system
distribution was observed between urban and more rural areas.
The results presented in table 2 indicate a relationship
between EMR system sophistication and the rate at which
certain preventive women's healthcare measures were ordered or
provided in 2007 and 2008. An estimated 31.2% of women aged
21 years and older were provided or ordered a breast examin-
ation. However, for the women whose visits were to providers
without EMR systems, that percentage was 20.3%. For minimal,
basic, and fully functional systems, respectively, the breast
examination rates were 35.0%, 37.2%, and 45.0%. The rate for
pelvic examinations increased similarly, from 28.4% to 45.8%, as
the degree of EMR system functionality rose from minimal to
full. The rate of exercise counseling rose from 16.9% to 33.4%
to 36.6% to 57.2% as functionality rose from no system, to
minimal, to basic, to full. For all women's health measures,
except for chlamydia testing and the seasonal flu vaccination,
providers with no EMR systems had the lowest rates. For chla-
mydia testing and vaccination, there was little difference in rates
by degree of system functionality up through basic systems.
Fully functional systems were associated with higher rates of
provision or prescription.
Table 3 reports estimated marginal probabilities from the
ordered probit regression. Relative to the reference group of
private practice, the probability of having either a basic or fully
functional EMR system by an HMO practice was significantly
(p<0.01) higher, whereas the probability of having either no
EMR or a minimal system was significantly (p<0.01) lower.
Solo practices, relative to group practices, were less likely
(p<0.01) to have basic and fully functional systems and more
likely (p<0.01) to have no EMR system in place. The two
higher levels of system functionality were also associated
(p<0.01) with the ability to have laboratory testing done at
the office. Compared to the physician specialty reference group
of cardiovascular disease physicians, the three women's health
specialties had lower estimated probabilities (p<0.01 often) of
having a basic or fully functional system and a higher probabil-
ity (p<0.01) of having no EMR system at all. Only for general
surgery, orthopedic surgery, urology, and otolaryngology, was
there no statistically significant difference relative to the cardio-
vascular specialty (results not shown). The two instrumental
variables had statistically significant (p<0.01) marginal prob-
abilities across the functionality distribution. Both increased
(p<0.01) the probability of basic or full functionality, whereas
both decreased (p<0.01) the probability of no or minimal func-
tionality. Whereas having one of the advanced functions
increased the probability of a basic system more than that of a
fully functional one, having both of the advanced functions did
the opposite. Using Hansen's J test for exogeneity, the exogene-
ity of the instrumental variables could not be rejected at the
5% significance level.
Second-stage regression results, including estimated coeffi-
cients and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the EMR sophistica-
tion levels, are presented in table 4. (A full set of estimated
IRRs is available in Appendix 1.) For seven of the 11 healthcare
outcomes studied, the presence of some type of EMR system
was important. Relative to no EMR system, utilization of

breast examinations, pelvic examinations, mammography, chla-
mydia testing, and cholesterol testing increased significantly,
even for a minimal EMR system. Moreover, as the degree of
functionality increased from minimal to basic to full, the IRR
for breast examinations rose from 1.11 (p<0.01) to 1.16
(p<0.01) to 1.20 (p<0.01), respectively, relative to no EMR
system. For cholesterol tests, the IRR was estimated at 1.07
(p<0.01) for minimal systems, 1.05 (p<0.01) for basic
systems, and 1.09 (p<0.01) for fully functional systems. In
addition, greater functionality increased the number of Pap
tests (IRR=1.44, p<0.05, for fully functional systems, and
IRR=1.34, p<0.05, for basic systems). For BMD testing, a fully
functional system had an estimated 6.48 IRR (p<0.01) relative
to no system. For BP testing, flu vaccination, diet and nutrition
counseling, and exercise counseling, there was no statistical evi-
dence supporting the causal importance of an EMR system.

Research and Applications
The number of examinations of various types clearly
depends on physician specialty. The highest estimated IRRs for
breast examinations are found for family, internal medicine,
and dermatology practitioners (Appendix 1). However, esti-
mated IRRs depend both on the type and size of practice.
Although the results indicate that almost all specialties (all but
urology) have a significantly higher IRR for a BP test than car-
diology, the interpretation would most likely be that the
patient-to-provider ratio is smaller for cardiology than for other
specialties. There also seems to be some regional variation in
women's health outcomes. The northeast, midwest, and south
all had statistically significantly lower rates, than the west, for
both Pap tests and BMD tests. The IRR for mammograms in
the south exceeded (p<0.05) that in the west. Of course, the
frequency of visits by women had a statistically significant
(p<0.01) effect on the total number of tests, examinations, or
counseling sessions that occurred. Patients on Medicaid were
more likely (p<0.01) to receive counseling on diet and nutri-
tion, relative to privately insured individuals, and less likely
(p<0.05) to receive counseling on exercise.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, only one previous study specifically linking
EMR system sophistication and healthcare outcomes has been
undertaken. Whereas Furukawa13 was unable to find a direct
statistical relationship between having a basic system and ED
efficiency, as captured by a number of different metrics (length
of stay in the ED, wait time to see a physician, diagnosis and
treatment time, and leaving without treatment), this study
found a statistically significant effect of a basic system for five
of the women's healthcare measures considered. Moreover,
there were no puzzling, statistically significant inverse relation-
ships between basic systems and outcomes, as Furukawa13
found. Furthermore, because we distinguished between no
EMR system and a minimal system, we could conclude that a
statistically significant relationship existed between a minimal
EMR system and health outcomes for five out of 11 measures;
having a few functions was `better than' none.
The results from this study are consistent with earlier ana-
lyses of the relationship between women's healthcare measures
and EMR system features. For example, in this study, the esti-
mated IRRs for mammograms ranged from 1.20 to 1.28 for
providers with EMR systems compared to those without. An
earlier study found a difference of 27% in mammograms
between sites with and without an EMR system.16 Moreover,
we found a statistically significant association between having
a basic EMR system and Pap tests (p<0.05) and mammograms
(p<0.10) ordered or provided, consistent with a previous
finding that reported an increase in visits by women to gyne-
cologists by 5% for mammograms and 7% for Pap tests with
the use of electronic prompts.17 The fact that the estimated
IRR for mammograms falls with the level of system sophistica-
tion is interesting. Whereas the demographic information avail-
able even in the minimal system may be important for
whether a mammogram is ordered, the higher-level functions,
such as electronic reminders, may not be that important now
for a test for which high awareness and low cost may facilitate
reasonable compliance regardless of physician involvement.18 19
Our study showed a statistically significant estimated IRR
for fully functional EMR system sophistication with respect to
bone density examinations ordered or provided. In fact, a fully
functional system was associated with over six times the
number of such tests relative to no EMR system, possibly due
to the presence of specific BMD test-related electronic remin-
ders present in the fully functional systems. Previous studies
have reported the use of highly advanced electronic reminders
and prompts in EMR systems for BMD checks in high-risk
women and as intervention for prevention of fractures in post-
menopausal women with osteoporosis. Results and conclu-
sions, however, have varied widely. A study that analyzed the
electronic reminder intervention for osteoporosis management
reported that after a 6-month period, there was a 51.5%
increase in bone density checks.11 Another study reported just
a 3% increase in bone density checks after a 6-month period.20
In that study, physicians reported that the electronic reminder
was a distraction, not a helpful aid.20
The difference in results between tables 2 and 4 underscores
the importance of accounting for endogeneity bias and con-
founding factors in the delivery of preventive women's health-
care. The strong positive association between diet/nutrition
counseling and the degree of EMR system sophistication does
not hold up in table 4. The features of EMR systems (as listed
in figure 1) would appear not to be particularly relevant for
counseling. The characteristics of patients and views of physi-
cians are likely to be much more important than system cap-
abilities.21 Furthermore, the positive relationship between BP
tests and the degree of EMR system sophistication (table 2) is
not seen in table 4, in which EMR sophistication has no statis-
tically significant effect on the number of BP tests. After con-
trolling for other provider and patient characteristics, it seems
as though having an EMR system has no causal effect on
whether a BP test is performed. A BP test is a routine compo-
nent of many physician office visits, unrelated to the existence
or sophistication of a EMR system.22 Finally, there was no asso-
ciation between system sophistication and flu vaccines.
Seasonal flu vaccines are offered in various venues, such as
retail pharmacies, encouraging patients to rely less on physician
offices.
A major limitation of the NAMCS data was that they did
not distinguish between ordering or provision of an examin-
ation or test. It cannot be assumed that patients necessarily fol-
lowed through with tests and examinations, let alone followed
advice on diet and exercise. Another limitation was the cross-
sectional nature of the NAMCS database that prevented ana-
lysis of the use of EMR systems over time. Physician response
to EMR systems was not measured. Moreover, at the time of
analysis, 2007 and 2008 were the latest NAMCS data available.
However, because of the fast-paced development and adoption
of EMR system technology, the results of this study will
become dated fairly quickly. Indeed, in 2011, it was reported by
the National Center for Health Statistics that 57% of office-
based physicians had an EMR system.23 Guidelines for
women's health also change periodically depending on the
latest research findings.14 Furthermore, although we classified
EMR systems as minimal, basic, or fully functional based on
the type and number of system features, we did not study the
features individually. Future work could determine which of
the advanced functions, for example, viewing imaging results
or electronic orders, is the more important for women's health.
In particular, the feature `reminders for guideline-based inter-
ventions and/or screening tests' is likely to be extremely
important for preventive women's health. Despite these limita-
tions, however, we were able to account for endogeneity and
confounding factors and examined the effectiveness of EMR
systems in providing 11 different preventive healthcare mea-
sures across a national sample of physicians.

CONCLUSION
The results of this study strongly suggest that EMR systems
have a positive impact on preventive women's healthcare. The
use of a national database along with advanced statistical tech-
niques allow for confidence in this conclusion. For breast exam-
inations, pelvic examinations, Pap tests, chlamydia tests,
cholesterol tests, mammograms, and BMD tests, an EMR
system increases the number of these tests and examinations
prescribed or performed. Furthermore, the level of sophistica-
tion increases the number of breast examinations, Pap tests,
chlamydia tests, cholesterol tests, and, most significantly, BMD
tests. This study may provide impetus for the specialists in
women's health to consider investing in more sophisticated
systems.

*A zero-inflated Poisson model (accounting for a substantial number of zero values for the dependent variable) was employed to measure the effect of EMR system sophistication and covariates on number of tests or examinations.
Hausman's test of endogeneity was conducted for each regression by including the residuals, calculated from first-stage ordered probit regression, along with the independent variables in the second stage. Except for the blood pressure regression, the
estimated coefficient on the residual variable was not statistically significant, so we could not reject exogeneity. Only in the blood pressure regression was exogeneity rejected (p<0.05). In this case, the first-stage residuals were kept in the second-stage
regression to ensure unbiased estimates.
