Employee well-being has received a great amount of
research interest in recent years (Rothmann, 2002; Van der
Colff and Rothmann, 2009) as an important predictor of
employee and organizational productivity (Wright and
Cropanzano, 2004; Wright etal., 2007), absenteeism, turn-
over, and performance deficits (Cropanzano etal., 2001).
In particular, there has been growing interest in the well-
being of personnel in demanding occupations such as
healthcare and emergency vocations where employees
face higher risks of poor mental and physical health
(Bennett etal., 2004; Ramirez etal., 1996) as a result of
chronic and acute stressors (Payne and Firth-Cozens,
1987; Rees and Cooper, 1992).
Ambulance staff, in particular, have been identified as
facing an especially challenging set of demands and chronic
job stressors (Moran and Britton, 1994; Young and Cooper,
1997). Studies comparing well-being across occupations
have highlighted ambulance services as one of six voca-
tions with greater work-related stress, and physical and
psychological well-being (Johnson etal., 2005). Another
study by Young and Cooper (1997) also found that ambu-
lance workers report lower job satisfaction, lower physical
and psychological health, and greater burnout. Within the
United Kingdom specifically, ambulance personnel have
higher rates of premature retirement compared to other
healthcare staff, due to poor mental and physical health
(Rodgers, 1998).
Despite being identified as a high-risk occupation,
there has been relatively little research on the well-being
of ambulance service workers (Bennett etal., 2004). The
first, and latest, systematic review of the literature in this
area was conducted by Sterud etal. (2006), regarding the
physical and psychological problems among ambulance
service staff. Sterud and colleagues found that a majority
of the studies were related to psychopathology in ambu-
lance personnel. In particular, most studies examined the
prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD;
Bisson and Deahl, 1994; Moran and Britton, 1994; Van
der Ploeg and Kleber, 2003) and the relevant coping strat-
egies and predictors (Bennett etal., 2004; Brough, 2005;
Marmar etal., 1999). After measures of mental health,
studies then focused largely on physical health of ambu-
lance workers (Öhman etal., 2002; Rodgers, 1998). The
literature hence largely concentrates on evaluating ambu-
lance personnel well-being in terms of negative outcomes
such as job stress or illness.

Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the different dimensions of well-being (namely, work engagement, job satisfaction, and
psychological stress) and possible predictors such as personality and perceived organizational support. A cross-sectional
survey design was used, with a sample of 490 ambulance personnel in the United Kingdom. Significant correlations were
found between the dimensions of job satisfaction, engagement, and stress. The results also supported a hierarchical
model with job satisfaction, stress, and engagement loading onto one higher order factor of work well-being. Emotional
stability and perceived organizational support were identified as significant predictors of well-being. The findings suggest
the importance of measuring the work-related well-being of ambulance personnel holistically and present perceived
organizational support as a possible area for interventions to improve well-being.

Report of empirical study

This study thus aimed to investigate the predictors,
dimensions, and factor structure of well-being in emer-
gency ambulance personnel. The aspects of well-being
examined in this study include work engagement, job satis-
faction, and job stress, while the predictors include per-
ceived organizational support (POS) and personality.
Dimensionality of well-being
Among the various components of psychological well-
being, affective well-being has been demonstrated to be
one of the most important indicators (Warr, 1994).
Affective well-being is a multi-dimensional construct that
reflects the frequency which individuals experience vari-
ous different positive and negative affects (Diener and
Larsen, 1993). Affective well-being can be measured spe-
cific to a domain and is frequently applied to measure
work-related well-being (Warr, 1990). Warr's proposed
dimensions of affective, work-related well-being include
enthusiasm­depression (measured by engagement and
burnout), anxiety­comfort (measured by occupational
stress), and pleasure­displeasure (measured by job
satisfaction).
A confirmatory factor analysis conducted by Daniels
(2000) also proposed a factor solution with multiple related
but distinct first-order dimensions (anxiety­comfort,
depression­pleasure, bored­enthusiastic, tiredness­vigor,
and angry­placid) and two second-order factors that cor-
respond to negative and positive affects (Watson and
Tellegen, 1985) as the best fit for measuring work-related
affective well-being. However, as Daniels' study used a
general sample population, there is a possibility that the
structure of well-being in ambulance personnel may be
similarly multi-dimensionality and hierarchical, but not
completely identical.
While there are no prior studies modeling well-being in
ambulance personnel, a study by Rothmann (2002) has
suggested a model of well-being for the police force, an
equally challenging vocation with its own inherent stress-
ors (Johnson et
al., 2005). Rothmann proposed a model
with four distinct but related factors (satisfaction, occupa-
tional stress, burnout, and engagement) loading onto a sin-
gle higher order factor of well-being. Given the similar
natures of these professions, it is possible that Rothmann's
model of well-being in the police force may be a better fit
than Daniels' (2000) model:
Hypothesis 1. Work-related well-being in ambulance
personnel is best modeled by a hierarchical model with
three related but distinct first-order factors loading onto
a single second-order factor of well-being (shown in
Figure 1).
Work engagement
The concept of work engagement has emerged from
research showing that certain employees find pleasure in
work despite strenuous job demands and stressors (Bakker
etal., 2007). This led Schaufeli etal. (2002) to propose the
theoretical construct of work engagement, a fulfilling and
positive work mindset. Work engagement is not momen-
tary, but is a persistent and continuous affective and cogni-
tive state, comprising the three dimensions: absorption
(i.e. being focused and engrossed in work), dedication (i.e.
being pride and enjoying work), and vigor (i.e. being ener-
getic and resilience).
Job satisfaction
Job satisfaction has been described (McShane, 2004) as an
individual's evaluation of his or her job and work context, and
as an overall feeling toward a job and its facets (Spector,
1997). As a construct, it has been operationalized both glob-
ally and multi-dimensionally, with the number of proposed
Figure 1. Hypothesized model of work-related well-being.
Soh et al. 3
dimensions ranging from 5 to 20 depending on the measure
(Fields, 2002). Common examples of job satisfaction dimen-
sions include satisfaction with coworkers, promotion, and
pay. The literature on job satisfaction suggests that it may be
positively related to job performance (Carr etal., 2003; Judge
etal., 2001) and organizational performance (Schneider etal.,
2003). As job satisfaction reflects employee attitudes to their
occupation, and has considerable criterion-related validity,
the measure has a history of being used to operationalize
employee well-being (Warr, 2002).
Occupational stress
Different models of occupational stress have been devel-
oped over the years such as the person­environment fit
model (French etal., 1982) and the demand­control model
(Fox etal., 1993). The person­environment fit model sug-
gests that physical and psychological stress results from an
inappropriate person­environment fit, while the demand­
control model explores the relationship between situational
demands and the freedom of the individual in meeting the
job requirements. While both models have contributed and
influenced the direction of job stress research, they focus
more on environment factors and individual capability,
rather than specific stressors, and the contribution of
individual differences in personality, coping strategies,
and resources (Spielberger and Vagg, 1994). Research on
occupational stress in emergency service personnel has
found that ambulance workers report facing more acute
and chronic work stress compared to controls (Young and
Cooper, 1997).
Perceived organizational support
Organizational support theory proposes that employees
form general beliefs regarding how much the organization
values their contribution, and is it concerned about their
well-being (Eisenberger etal., 1986). POS has been shown
to positively correlate to employee concern for organiza-
tional welfare and commitment to achieving organizational
goals. POS was also an indirect contributor to affective
commitment and performance (Eisenberger etal., 2001).
While the relationship between well-being and POS has
not been studied specifically in ambulance personnel,
research by Cicognani etal. (2009) has found that a sense
of community is significantly correlated to compassion sat-
isfaction and well-being in ambulance personnel. A study
by Beaton etal. (1997) also found that paramedics with
greater perceived social and network support from cowork-
ers had higher levels of job satisfaction and morale and
lower appraised occupational stress:
Hypothesis 2. POS will be a significant, positive predic-
tor of work well-being in ambulance personnel.
Personality
Various studies have shown personality to be a consistent
and significant predictor of well-being (Diener et
al.,
1999). Research in this area generally suggests emotional
stability and extraversion as significant predictors of sat-
isfaction and well-being (Schimmack et
al., 2002). A
meta-analysis by Steel etal. (2008) found low emotional
stability to be the strongest predictor of well-being, par-
ticularly of negative measures, followed by extraversion
which strongly predicted positive measures in particular.
However, studies disagree on how much variance in well-
being personality factors account for. DeNeve and
Cooper's (1998) meta-analysis, for example, found emo-
tional stability and extraversion to be statistically signifi-
cant predictors, but reports less than half the amount of
variance accounted for.
With regards to the ambulance personnel specifically,
few studies have examined the relationship between per-
sonality and well-being. One such study by Young and
Cooper (1997) found that "type A" personality, character-
ized by hostility, aggression, and a need for accomplish-
ment (Friedman and Rosenman, 1974), was a predictor of
mental health symptoms after 6months. Another study by
Brough (2005) also examined emotional stability and found
that low emotional stability was a strong, negative indictor
of work well-being in a sample of ambulance workers from
New Zealand. This is supported by the inclusion of emo-
tional stability in various evaluations of psychological
well-being (Goddard etal., 2004):
Hypothesis 3. Emotional stability will be a significant
positive predictor of well-being in ambulance service
staff.
Hypothesis 4. Extraversion will be a significant positive
predictor of well-being in ambulance service staff.
In the present experiment, a sample of ambulance per-
sonnel in the United Kingdom was used to investigate the
above-mentioned hypotheses on emergency service staff
well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then
used to explore the factor structure of well-being.
Method
Participants
A sample of 490 ambulance service staff (253 males, 237
females) within the United Kingdom participated in the
study. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 67
years,
with a mean age of 41.49 (standard deviation
(SD)
=
10.56)
years. The majority of the sample was
White British (94.3%). A list with the detailed demo-
graphics is available upon request.

Measures
Perceived organizational support.Perceptions of organiza-
tional support were measured using a short form of Eisen-
berger and colleague's survey of perceived organizational
support (SPOS; Eisenberger etal., 1986). The 5 highest
loading items from the original 36 were chosen for the pre-
sent experiment. The use of shorter forms of the scale that
include both facets of POS (caring for employee well-being
and valuing employee contribution) has been validated and
proved reliable due to the original scale being unidimen-
sional in nature and having a high internal reliability
(Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002). The items use a 7-point
Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly
agree. A meta-analysis of studies measuring POS found
that the scale had a high average internal reliability of
=.90 (Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002).
Stress.Psychological symptoms of stress were measured
using a 3-item scale developed by Patchen (perceived
supervisor support (PSS); 1970). Participants responded
using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (less than once
a month) to 5 (two or three times a week). Patchen's 3-item
scale has been reported to have an internal consistency of
.89 (Thomas and Tymon, 1995)
Work engagement.The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale
(UWES; Schaufeli etal., 2002) was used as a measure of
work engagement. The three subscales of the UWES--
vigor, dedication, and absorption--were used in the study.
All items were scored on a 7-point Likert scale from
strongly disagree to strongly agree. A previous study has
found Cronbach's  for the three subscales to fall range
from .68 to .91 (Storm and Rothmann, 2003).
Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured using a facet
approach, with nine single-item scales each measuring satis-
faction toward a specific job aspect: physical environment,
independence, work hours, pay, promotion opportunities,
job security, attention from management, supervisors, and
coworkers. Participants responded using a 7-point Likert
scale that ranged from very dissatisfied to very satisfied.
Personality. The single-item measure of personality (SIMP;
Woods and Hampson, 2005), a short measure of the five-
factor model (McCrae and Costa, 1999) was used to meas-
ure personality. The inventory uses single-item scales, each
corresponding to one personality factor. The SIMP was
reported by its authors to have acceptable levels of diver-
gent and convergent validity, reliability, and self-other
accuracy. The measure starts with the stem "Generally, I
come across as": followed by five bipolar response scales,
each with a description of the factor extremes on either side
of the scale (e.g. "Someone who is sensitive and excitable,
and can be tense" versus "Someone who is relaxed,
unemotional, rarely gets irritated, and seldom feels blue").
The measure has been shown to have a convergence rang-
ing from r
=
.55 to .66 (M=
.61), with longer five-factor
personality scales.
Design and data collection
The present experiment used a cross-sectional, quantitative
survey design. Data collection for this study was carried out
by Zeal Solutions using an online survey platform as part of
a regular assessment of employee well-being within the UK
ambulance service.
Model fit indices
Due to a lack of consensus in the field, multiple goodness-
of-fit indices were used. First, a 2 goodness-of-fit statistic
evaluating the degrees of freedom and statistical signifi-
cance was used. As the 2 statistic is sensitive to large sam-
ple sizes, other goodness-of-fit indices were used such as
the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA;
indicates total amount of error in fit proportional to com-
plexity), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; compares global
fit of the independent and hypothesized model, with sample
size accounted for), the Tucker­Lewis Index (TLI; Tucker
and Lewis, 1973; measures relative covariation accounted
for), and the Normed-Fit Index (NFI; measures global
model fit by comparing hypothesized model with a com-
pletely independent model). The recommended values for
model fit on the RMSEA are less than .06 for a good fit (Hu
and Bentler, 1999), between .08 and .06 for a moderate fit,
and greater than .08 for a mediocre fit (MacCallum etal.,
1996). Values greater than .90 on the CFI, NFI, and TLI
indicate an acceptable fit, while values larger than .95 sug-
gest a very good fit (Bentler, 1990).
Results
Descriptive statistics and correlational analysis
Means, SDs, and  correlations of each measure are dis-
played in Table 1. The Cronbach's  coefficients of the
multi-item scales were all greater than .70, demonstrating
measure reliability. Pearson correlations between the meas-
ured variables were calculated to examine the relationship
between the different individual factors and dimensions of
well-being.
The three engagement factors correlated significantly to
PSS, job satisfaction, POS, extraversion, agreeableness,
and emotional stability. There was also a significant corre-
lation between PSS and job satisfaction. The personality
factors of extraversion and emotional stability correlated
significantly to PSS, while agreeableness and emotional
stability were correlated to both POS and job satisfaction.
Finally, POS also correlated with PSS and job satisfaction.

Factor structure of work engagement measured
by the UWES
A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to validate
the theoretical three-dimensional model of engagement in
the present sample and the appropriateness of using com-
posite scores for each factor. The overall fit of the resulting
three-dimensional model is shown in Table 2. As seen from
Table 2, while a three-factor model was a better fit than
an alternative one-factor model, it was not an ideal fit
before covariance was allowed. However, once errors were
allowed to covary, there was a significant improvement in
fit, with the 2 decreased by approximately three times, the
RMSEA below the 1 cut-off, and CFI, TLI, and NFI statis-
tics well above the strict .95 cut-off.
Factor model of well-being
In order to test the fit of the hypothesized model (as reported
in the introduction), SEM was used to compare the good-
ness-of-fit of the model against two alternative models dis-
played in Figure 2. The first alternative model, (labeled
"Model 1"; based on Daniels, 2000) involved the various
dimensions loading onto two higher order factors, with
psychological stress and job satisfaction loading onto the
negative affect factor, and engagement on the positive
affect factor. The second model involved a one-factor
model (labeled "Model 2") with all the components of
well-being loading onto a single first-order factor. The
measured variables and error terms were not depicted in the
figures for parsimony.
The findings gave us a clear idea regarding which model
has the best fit (Table 3). As we can see in Table 3, the
hypothesized model had a slighter better fit than the two
alternatives (.1
U of increase in CFI and .2
U in NFI).
Furthermore, when covariance was allowed, the hypothe-
sized model still had a slighter better fit than the two alter-
natives (RMSEA decreased by .1U and CFI, TLI, and NFI
increased by .1
U). The hypothesized model and the path
loadings can be seen in Figure 3.
Causal model of well-being
Finally, SEM was used to evaluate the relationship between
personality and POS as predictors of work-related well-
being. The full hypothesized structural equation model
tested is shown in Figure 4. For the sake of parsimony, the
observed measures as well as the error terms were not dis-
played in the figure. The overall model was found to be a
relatively good fit with the data (2=1068.131, df=333,
p<.001, RMSEA=.067, CFI=.911, TLI=.899, and
NFI=.876), with a RMSEA value smaller than .08 indicat-
ing an acceptable fit, and CFI, TLI, and NFI values
approaching or greater than the recommended .90.
Table 4 below displays the factor loadings and parame-
ter estimates in the model. The factor loadings from the
SEM analysis indicated that POS and emotional stability
were significant direct predictors of work-related well-
being. Emotional stability was also found to be a predictor
of POS and to have a mediated effect to well-being through
POS.
However, the results of the SEM analysis also indicated
that the structural parameters representing the paths from
extraversion to work-related well-being and POS were not
significant (=.025, p=.065; =.064, p=.582).As a result,
a new model was specified, with extraversion removed
from the model to make it more parsimonious. The result of
the newest model after covariance was allowed is depicted

Discussion
The present experiment investigated the dimensions of
work-related well-being (job satisfaction, engagement, and
occupational stress) in UK ambulance staff as well as the
individual factors that predict ambulance staff well-being.
The findings supported a more holistic model of well-being
in ambulance staff that includes various positive measures
such as job satisfaction and engagement as well. The find-
ings also indicated POS and emotional stability to be the
significant predictors of well-being.
Measuring work-related well-being
Hypothesis 1 was supported by results which indicated
that a hierarchical model with different dimensions of
affective well-being loading onto a single higher order
factor was a good fit for data representing ambulance per-
sonnel well-being. This supported Warr's (1990) three-
dimensional model of affective work-related well-being
and Rothmann's (2002) suggestion of a single higher
order well-being factor for personnel working in stressful,
emergency response situations.
This model was a better fit than Daniels' (2000) pro-
posed model of multiple dimensions loading onto two
higher order factors of positive and negative affects. A pos-
sible explanation is that Daniels' study utilized a wider
variety of measures that more comprehensively captured
the dimension space of affective well-being in the work

domain. In particular, Daniels' study included the dimen-
sion of angry­placid, which was not measured in the pre-
sent experiment. As this dimension was found to
significantly characterize the higher order factor of nega-
tive affect, the lack of measures for this dimension may
account for why a two-factor structure was not a best fit for
the present data. Overall, however, the present model is
consistent with the literature in highlighting the multi-
dimensional nature of well-being and suggesting the appro-
priateness of such an approach to well-being in ambulance
personnel.
Individual difference predictors of well-being
In support of hypothesis 2, SEM showed that POS was a
significant predictor of the higher order factor of well-being
in ambulance personnel. This result suggests that the level
of organizational support experienced by ambulance per-
sonnel strongly and directly influences their level of affec-
tive well-being.
Although the relationship between POS and work-
related well-being has not been directly studied, this find-
ing matches the theoretical understanding of POS,
well-being measures such as engagement and satisfaction.
Employees reporting high POS feel that the organization is
concerned for their well-being and appreciates the contri-
butions that they provide (Eisenberger etal., 1986). It is
thus understandable that employees with this belief are
more likely to express greater satisfaction with their organi-
zation. Additionally, Van der Ploeg and Kleber's (2003)
study of ambulance personnel found that social support at
work and organizational communication were the best

predictors of physical and mental health. This highlighted
the particular importance of the social work environment
and the organization in contributing to the well-being of
ambulance staff.
SEM results also supported hypothesis 3, indicating that
emotional stability was a modest but significant predictor
of well-being in emergency ambulance staff. Within the
model, emotional stability was found to have both a direct
and a mediated effect through POS on both factors
of well-being. This supports existing findings where high
levels of emotional stability predicted greater well-being in
the general population (Steel etal., 2008).
The literature suggests that the relationship between
emotional stability and well-being occurs because high
emotional stability results in a lower negativity bias
(Watson et
al., 1987). A decreased propensity toward
negative cognitions and schemas may then influence well-
being by increasing thoughts of satisfaction and engage-
ment with work. Emotional stability has also been
proposed as an affective disposition determining the expe-
rience of positive or negative affect, with emotionally sta-
ble individuals more positive and pleasant affective
well-being (Diener and Lucas, 1999). It is possible that
the mediated relationship between emotional stability and
POS is largely similar to the direct relationship between
emotional stability and well-being as well. The same dis-
position toward negative affect and cognitions is likely to

feels they receive, and the attributions they make toward
the organization.
The results of the SEM analysis did not support hypoth-
esis 4, as extraversion was not a significant predictor of
well-being in ambulance staff, and thus they were removed
from the overall regression model. This contradicted previ-
ous findings (DeNeve and Cooper, 1998; Steel etal., 2008)
of extraversion as a significant predictor of well-being in
the general population. This difference may be due to the
use of SIMP. While this measure has an established validity
and reliability, it may not adequately encompass the dimen-
sion space of trait extraversion and may also lack statistical
power. It is also possible that extraversion may not be a
relevant predictor of well-being in ambulance staff specifi-
cally. Given the unique nature of the vocation (Carriere and
Bourque, 2009), it is possible that compared to the general
population, a different set of traits may be essential in pre-
dicting ambulance personnel well-being.
Limitations and future research
One limitation of the present experiment was the necessary
use of a cross-sectional design due to limited resources and
time frame. While the use of advanced statistical models
such as SEM allows causal relationships to be tested even
with a cross-sectional design, carefully controlled longitudi-
nal designs are ultimately preferred to establish causality.
Another limitation was the sample and item size. While
the current sample size was sufficiently large for such anal-
yses, it was smaller than previous studies with samples
ranging from 600 to 5000 individuals (Daniels, 2000; Van
der Colff and Rothmann, 2009). The present sample may
thus be insufficient to extract more complicated factor solu-
tions (MacCallum etal., 1999). Additionally, the present
experiment utilized abbreviated measures with a smaller
number of items compared to the longer forms used by pre-
vious studies. While these abbreviated forms have consid-
erable construct reliability and validity, the smaller number
of items to extract may have resulted in less stable and
coherent latent factors compared to longer measures
(Costello and Osborne, 1994).
Finally, the variety of measures and lack of appropriate
previous samples prevent comparison of the levels of posi-
tive well-being of ambulance personnel against other occu-
pations. Future studies may thus consider using similar
cross-occupational samples, such as in Brough (2005) and
Johnson et
al. (2005), to compare the levels of positive
well-being in ambulance staff against other occupations.
Further research into individual predictors of ambulance
personnel well-being such as personality or demographic
factors should also be encouraged due to the limited num-
ber of existing studies (Sterud etal., 2006).
Implications
The findings of this study have significant theoretical
implications for how the well-being of ambulance service
staff should be evaluated. The current literature has taken
an approach targeted predominantly at treating negative
symptoms of physical illness and PTSD (James and Wright,
1991; Sterud etal., 2006). However, these results suggest
that a holistic approach that includes positive and affective

aspects is equally applicable and relevant to understanding
the well-being of ambulance personnel as well. Future
research should thus consider a broader approach to evalu-
ating well-being, more similar to that taken in general fields
of organizational psychology. Additionally, this study high-
lights a need for greater focus on individual difference pre-
dictors such as personality or demographics.
The results from this experiment also have significant
practical implications for managing well-being in ambu-
lance personnel. First, they suggest that ambulance services
should ensure that they evaluate not just the negative aspects
of staff well-being, but include positive measures such as
engagement and job satisfaction as well. Additionally, they
indicate that organizations should attend to important indi-
vidual and organizational predictors of well-being. For
example, the finding of POS as a predictor presents a feasi-
ble area for organizational interventions to improve the
well-being of ambulance staff. Managers in this field should
thus consider actions that may be taken to increase the levels
of POS and demonstrate that the organization values the
contribution and welfare of their ambulance service staff.
