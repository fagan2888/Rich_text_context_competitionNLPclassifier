Abstract
Using data for German and Swedish multinational enterprises (MNEs), this
paper assesses international employment patterns. It analyzes determinants
of location choice and the degree of substitutability of labor across locations.
Countries with highly skilled labor forces attract German MNEs, but we find
no such evidence for Swedish MNEs. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that German MNEs locate production stages intensive in high-skilled labor
abroad. In MNEs from either country, affiliate employment tends to substi-
tute for employment at the parent firm. At the margin, substitutability is the
strongest with respect to affiliate employment in Western Europe. A one per-
cent larger wage gap between Germany and locations in Central and Eastern
Europe (CEE) is estimated to be associated with 900 fewer jobs in German
parents and 5,000 more jobs in affiliates located in CEE. A one percent larger
wage gap between Sweden and CEE is estimated to be associated with 140
fewer jobs in Swedish parents and 260 more jobs in affiliates located in CEE.

1 Introduction
The expansion of domestic firms' operations abroad and the outsourcing of produc-
tion stages to low-income countries in particular raise concerns about labor market
consequences in high-income countries. Theory suggests that the foreign expansion of
multinational enterprises (MNEs) may lead to a downward pressure on real wages for
relatively scarce types of labor in the home country. However, besides cost reductions,
an important motive for outward foreign direct investment (FDI) is market expan-
sion. In fact, a major part of MNEs' foreign operations is concentrated in high- rather
than low-income countries. In 2000, 63 percent of the foreign labor force of German
MNEs worked in industrialized countries. Similarly, in 2002, 77 percent of the foreign
labor force of Swedish MNEs worked in industrialized countries (ITPS 2004). The
co-existence of both market-seeking and cost-reducing forces makes theoretical pre-
dictions about the effect of outward FDI on real wages ambiguous. Moreover, even
when considering exclusively cost-reducing FDI, the theoretical prediction about the
effect on parent employment is ambiguous. The effect depends on whether the cost
reduction allows the MNE to expand its market share, and whether the parent retains
activities at home that are complementary to foreign operations.
To what extent FDI may lead to reduced labor demand at home and downward
pressure on home country wages is therefore inherently an empirical issue. We use
data on German and Swedish MNEs at the parent and affiliate level to assess the
FDI effects. We ask: (i) What factors determine where MNEs choose to operate their
foreign affiliates? (ii) How is the firm's employment in different locations affected by
wages in those locations?
Our German data combine information on domestic firms' balance sheets (Un-
ternehmensbilanzstatistik, ustan) with information on German firms' foreign affili-
ate holdings (Direktinvestitionenstatistik, direk). Both sets of data are collected by
Deutsche Bundesbank Frankfurt and matched in this paper for the first time. The
German data on outward FDI cover the foreign affiliates of German MNEs (above a
certain size threshold and with a ten-percent ownership share). We restrict our at-
tention to majority-owned affiliates of German MNEs to make the data comparable
across countries. The Swedish data (collected by the Research Institute of Industrial
Economics IUI Stockholm) cover around 75 percent of all Swedish manufacturing
companies above a certain size threshold with at least one majority-owned foreign
affiliate in manufacturing. To construct comparable data for the two countries, we
choose the year 2000 for Germany, the first year for which we have a full match of do-
mestic parents and foreign affiliates, and the year 1998 for Sweden, the last currently
available year of Swedish MNE data.
We run regressions of location choice with a large set of parent-level controls and
location-specific variables. We also estimate multi-location translog cost functions
from which we can infer the degree of substitutability between parent and affiliate
employment. Our results show that German MNEs are attracted to host countries
2
with relatively abundant supplies of skilled labor. This confirms recent findings for a
sample of German MNEs with affiliates in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (Marin
2004). However, we find no such evidence for Swedish MNEs, suggesting that this
tendency may indeed be particular to Germany.
Multi-location cost function estimates show that affiliate employment tends to
substitute for employment at the parent firm both at German and Swedish MNEs.
At the margin, this substitutability between parent and affiliate employment is most
pronounced for affiliates in other Western European countries. However, we also find
substitutability between parent employment and affiliate employment in Central and
Eastern Europe (CEE). Because of the larger wage differential between Germany
and Sweden on the one hand and CEE on the other hand, than between different
Western European countries, this may be the economically more important effect. An
evaluation of our multi-location cost function estimates at the sample mean shows
that a one percent larger wage gap between Germany and locations in CEE may
destroy around 900 jobs in German parents and create around 5,0000 in affiliates
located in CEE. A similar evaluation for Sweden shows that a one percent larger
wage gap between Sweden and CEE may destroy 140 jobs in Swedish parents and
create around 260 jobs in affiliates located in CEE.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We document overall employ-
ment trends for MNEs operating in Sweden and Germany in section 2 and discuss
the related literature. Section 3 presents our econometric frameworks, and section 4
describes the data on MNEs used. We present the empirical analysis of location
choice in section 5 and the analysis of employment responses to wages across differ-
ent locations in section 6. Section 7 concludes.
2 German and Swedish FDI and Related Litera-
ture
In 2001, German MNEs employed about 2.5 million workers abroad, and Swedish
MNEs around one million workers (see figures 1 and 2). Whereas employment at Ger-
man parents roughly matches in size the employment at foreign affiliates, employment
at Swedish parents is only about half of their employment at foreign affiliates.
Affiliate employment of German and Swedish MNEs roughly doubled over the
course of the 1990s. In Germany, employment at the parent firms increased over this
period as well. At face value, these facts do not provide evidence in support of the
widely held opinion that German MNEs have shifted employment to foreign locations.
In contrast, Swedish parent employment fell during the same period--lending more
support to the notion that MNEs contribute to a relocation of jobs abroad. Our
analysis will show, however, that when we study employment patterns at the level of
firms, employment responses to wage differentials between home and host countries
are very similar for Swedish and German MNEs.

Recently, outward FDI from Germany and Sweden to CEE has surged. Both
countries are close to recent accession countries to the European Union (EU); Ger-
many to the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary; Sweden to the Baltic states and
Poland. Firms in both Germany and Sweden may realize potentially large labor
cost reductions by relocating activities to CEE. The focus of this paper on manu-
facturing activities notwithstanding, a large share of recent outward FDI from both
Germany and Sweden has taken place in the service sector. At both German and
Swedish MNEs, roughly 40 percent of their foreign employees work in service indus-
tries (Becker, Ekholm, J¨
ackle and Muendler 2004, ITPS 2004).
Germany has long been an important host country of foreign MNEs, whereas Swe-
den received little inward FDI until the mid 1990s. Figures 1 and 2 show, however,
that Germany's and Sweden's recent experiences tend to partly reverse this pat-
tern. Employment of foreign-owned firms in Germany has fallen while employment
of foreign-owned firms in Sweden has risen. Both countries have a long history as
home countries of globally successful MNEs (including corporations such as Siemens,
Volkswagen, Electrolux, Ericsson, and Volvo). The work force of Swedish manufac-
turing MNEs is, however, more international than that of German manufacturing
MNEs. Table 1 shows that the foreign share of the Swedish manufacturing MNEs'
work force was 59.4 percent in 1998, while the corresponding share for German man-
ufacturing MNEs in 2000 was 39.4 percent. A likely explanation for this difference
is that the larger size of the German market makes Germany a relatively more at-
tractive production base for domestic as well as foreign firms compared to Sweden,

Prior research into the effect of FDI on home-country labor markets mostly focuses
on the effect of locating low-skill-intensive production abroad. Feenstra and Hanson
(1999) find that foreign outsourcing of U.S. firms to affiliates or unrelated firms
abroad contributed substantially to the observed increase in the wage premium for
skilled labor in the U.S. Slaughter (2000) studies the same issue focusing exclusively
on FDI. He does not find that shifts of production activities from U.S. parents to
foreign affiliates has a significant wage impact. This finding has been interpreted as
evidence that the effects found by Feenstra and Hanson's (1999) is mainly related to

trade at arm's length, sub-contracting or licensing. Head and Ries (2002) estimate
the impact of a foreign expansion of Japanese MNEs on the skill-intensity of the
work force at Japanese parents and find that foreign expansions lead to an increased
skill-intensity and higher wages at the parent firm, and that this effect is stronger
when firms expand into low-wage countries.
For Sweden and Germany, some studies report evidence that MNEs tend to lo-
cate relatively high-skill intensive rather than low-skill intensive activities abroad.
Evidence of skill seeking among Swedish MNEs is presented by Blomstr¨
om, Fors and
Lipsey (1997). However, Hansson (2001) disputes their result and finds in a study sim-
ilar to Slaughter (2000) that shifts of production activities within Swedish MNEs to
non-OECD countries have a negative effect on the relative wage of unskilled Swedish
workers. Marin (2004) presents recent evidence of skill seeking among German MNEs.
She uses detailed data on German (and Austrian) MNEs and their activities in CEE
and finds that the foreign affiliates tend to employ workers with higher educational
attainment and offer more R&D related occupations than the German (and Austrian)
parents.
For an assessment of the effects of outward FDI on the home economy it is in-
structive to know what factors attract FDI to foreign locations in the first place.
A few studies analyze how host country factors affect the location choice of MNEs.
Head and Mayer (2002) examine whether market potential is an important factor
for the location choice of Japanese MNEs. Based on the same affiliate-level data
as we use, Buch, Kleinert, Lipponer and Toubal (2004) study the location choice of
German MNEs and argue that, on average, market access is a stronger motive than
cost reduction for firms to conduct FDI. We extend their work by augmenting the
affiliate-level data for Germany and Sweden with a large set of parent-level variables.
We control for both relative endowments of skilled labor and labor cost differentials
between the home and host country, and find that German MNEs tend to seek skill
abundant foreign locations while, conditional on skill endowments, high labor costs
deter FDI.
We complement the evidence on location choice with an investigation into whether
parent and affiliate employment tend to substitute or complement each other. Slaugh-
ter (1995) proposes the estimation of multi-location translog cost functions in order
to test whether employment at foreign affiliates tends to substitute for or be a com-
plement to employment at domestic parent firms. Brainard and Riker (2001) and
Konings and Murphy (2001) apply the translog framework to U.S. and European
corporations, respectively. Brainard and Riker (2001) find that foreign affiliate em-
ployment substitutes modestly for U.S. parent employment. However, substitutability
is stronger between workers employed in different low-wage locations than between
parents and affiliates. Konings and Murphy (2001) find weaker substitutability be-
tween parent employment and affiliate employment in CEE than between parent
employment and affiliate employment in the EU-15. We follow this literature and
estimate translog cost functions for German and Swedish MNEs, distinguishing be-
6
tween high-income and low-income foreign locations.1
3 Empirical Models
An MNE's location choice and its subsequent employment decision could be viewed
as a two-stage process. The MNE first chooses the location of its fixed assets--taking
into account expected wage levels across regions and market prospects. Then, the
MNE employs foreign workers to operate the fixed assets across locations, taking
into account the prevailing wage levels in those locations and realized demand for the
firm's output. We follow the existing literature closely and analyze the determinants
of these decisions in two separate empirical models: A logit location choice model to
capture investment in fixed assets, and an independent multi-location cost function
model that considers the location choice as given.
In modeling location choice, we start from individual FDI decisions. MNEs can
locate in up to J countries. We follow the prior literature in that we treat location
choices as independent of one another, using a multinomial choice model for the
analysis. This setup rests on the implicit assumption that an MNE management
board delegates the location choice to I members, who individually select a location
for investment out of the J alternatives. While this assumption is unlikely to be
strictly accurate, the setup has advantages over a simpler binomial choice model that
would not allow for an analysis of host country effects on location choice. From
several alternative multinomial logit models, we select the conditional logit (CL)
framework. We adopt the CL framework after testing, in a more general nested logit
model, whether we can reduce the number of parent-location interactions. We do not
find estimates to be significantly different when reducing the number of interactions
from seven to three groups of locations. A subsequent test whether the nested logit
model should be adopted in lieu of the more parsimonious conditional logit model
fails to reject homoskedasticity (a likelihood ratio test), suggesting that the CL model
is appropriate.
3.1 Multinomial location choice
The benefit to a firm (or rather decision maker) i (i = 1, . . . , I) of investing in country
j (j = 1, . . . , J) can be described with the latent variable
U
ij
= Vij
+ ij
(1)
1Related evidence is presented by Braconier and Ekholm (2000) and Marin (2004), who estimate
wage elasticities without using translog cost functions. Castellani and Navaretti (2004) also study
the effect of FDI on parent employment. Using propensity score matching techniques for Italian
manufacturers, they find that a foreign expansion has no significant effect on employment.

where Vij
is the deterministic part and ij
is the stochastic part. Vij
can, in general,
be written as
Vij

 (2)
where zj
denotes a vector of location-specific variables and xir
stands for a vector of
firm characteristics, interacted with country group indicators r (r = 1, . . . , R), that
may influence the relative attractiveness of the alternatives.
The decision maker in multinomial choice models selects one out of J mutually ex-
clusive alternatives, picking the option that provides the highest benefit. The econo-
metrician only observes the outcome. The probability of observing firm i choosing
alternative j is

Given the deterministic parts Vi1
, . . . , ViJ
, the probability Pij
to observe out-
come j for decision maker i depends on the distribution of the stochastic error term
i1
, . . . , iJ
.
The CL framework suggests an interpretation of estimation results along the fol-
lowing lines.
1. For country-specific variables zj
, the odds ratio (i.e. the relative probability
ratio) of choosing a host country m relative to not choosing the location is:
m|m =m
(xir
, zj
) =
P(yi
= m|xir
, zj
)
1 - P(yi
= m|xir
, zj
)
. (4)
Based on m|·=m
, we generate relative risk ratios (RRR) as ratios of the calcu-
lated odds ratios, where the variable of interest is increased by  in the numer-
ator. Using, for example, the location-specific variable GDPm
, RRR becomes:
RRR =
m|m =m
(GDPm
+ , xir
, zj
)
m|m =m
(GDPm
, xir
, zj
)
= exp(^
GDP
· ). (5)
For an increase of  in GDPm
, the relative probability of investing in country
m versus not investing in country m changes by a factor of exp(^
GDP
· ),
holding everything else constant. For logarithmic variables one can state more
explicitly that an increase in GDPm
by one percent (i.e. log(GDPm
× 1.01) 
log(GDP) + .01) changes the relative probability of investing in country m
versus not choosing this location by a factor of exp(^
GDP
× .01).
2. The RRR with respect to the (interacted) parent-specific variables, xir
, needs
to be calculated relative to a reference region B. Applied to domestic sectoral

wages wiC
(domestic wages interacted with country group indicator C), for
instance, the RRR becomes:
RRR =
c|b
(wi
+ , xir
, zj
)
c|b
(wi
, xir
, zj
)
= exp(^
wiC
· ), (6)
where ^
wiC
is the estimated parameter of domestic sectoral wages (wiC
) for
country group C, and b and c refer to any country belonging to region B and
C, respectively. A natural interpretation of equation (6) therefore implies, that
an increase in sectoral wages by  changes the odds of choosing a location in
region C compared to investing in one of the countries belonging to region B
by the factor exp(^
wiC
· ).2
3.2 Employment responses to wages
Given their long-term location choice across countries, we consider MNEs to be price
takers in the labor markets of their domestic and foreign affiliates. A short-run
translog cost function, in which installed capital is considered a quasi-fixed factor,
enables us to assess how outward FDI affects home employment. We treat labor
employed in a location r as a distinct factor and output produced at that location as
a distinct output. So, a firm i produces R region-specific outputs Qir
(r = 1, . . . , R).
Considering labor as immobile across multinational locations, the parent i employs
R different types of labor Lir
(r = 1, . . . , R) across locations given its quasi-fixed
capital stocks Kir
.
Under a common short-run translog cost function,3 firm i's cost share of labor in
location r is then given by

The signs of the Arm

ployed in one location is a substitute for or a complement to labor employed at

function to a long-run multiproduct translog cost function. We consider capital a quasi-fixed factor

another location. However, we can infer Hicksian factor price elasticities rm
of labor
demand responses at location r to wages at location m from coefficient estimates in
(7) and mean cost shares. Following Anderson and Thursby (1986), we infer the wage
elasticities of labor demand as

where ¯

are the regional sample means of the MNEs cost shares. If labor in r
is a substitute for (complement to) labor in m, the wage elasticity rm
is positive
(negative).4 That is, if an increase in wages at location m leads to higher (lower)
employment in location r, labor in m is a substitute for (complement to) labor in m.
In a translog framework, the wage elasticities rm
and mr
are not restricted to be
equal (although the cost function coefficients have to be, Arm
= Amr
).
4 Data on Domestic Parents and Foreign Affiliates
The German data on outward FDI derive from information in Deutsche Bundesbank's
(BuBa) direk database at the level of German parents and their foreign affiliates. All
foreign affiliates fulfilling either of the following criteria are reported: (i) the parent
controls at least 10 percent of equity and the balance sheet total is at least 5 million
EUR; (ii) the parent controls at least 50 percent of equity and the balance sheet is at
least .5 million EUR. We relegate further details on these FDI data to appendix A.
To obtain comparable data to Sweden, however, we only use information on majority-
owned affiliates in the present paper. We match these FDI data with information on
the German parent's domestic operations from BuBa's ustan data through string
matches based on company names and addresses. ustan is a balance-sheet data set
that includes employment information. Appendix B describes the data and our string
matching procedure in more detail.
The data for Sweden are part of a firm-level database on Swedish manufacturing
firms with foreign production affiliates. These data derive from a comprehensive sur-
vey by the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IUI) in Stockholm. The survey
has been repeated about every fourth year since 1970. The most recent available sur-
vey covers the year 1998 (for a description of the data from this survey, see Ekholm
and Hesselman 2000). The survey samples all manufacturing firms headquartered
in Sweden, with at least 50 employees (world-wide) and at least one foreign affiliate
with some manufacturing activity.
There are some inherent differences between the two datasets. The German
dataset is much larger than the Swedish one. In the cross-section analyses we carry

< 0) to
labor at location m, we use the symmetric confidence interval around the estimate ^

proposed by Anderson and Thursby (1986) along with confidence intervals based on a bootstrapping
procedure.

out in this paper, we can use information on 463 German parents while we can only
use information on 94 Swedish parents. The Swedish dataset, on the other hand,
contains some information which is unavailable for the German firms. In the Swedish
dataset, total labor costs and employment are reported by the firms at both parent
and affiliate level. Information about labor costs per employee can thus be obtained
from the dataset. For German firms, we have information about employment of par-
ents and affiliates, but no information about wage bills. This implies that we have
to use information about wages from other sources when dealing with the German
firms.
5 Location Choice
We estimate location choice with a conditional logit (CL) model (section 3.1), using
as dependent variable the presence of affiliate activity by country. We carry out the
analysis for one year: 2000 in the case of Germany and 1998 in the case of Sweden.
The dependent variable, the presence indicator per country, takes a value of one if
there is at least one majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliate in the country.
We use parent-specific variables xir
, interacted with location characteristics, and
location-specific variables zj
as regressors. Parent-specific variables include employ-
ment, (non-financial) fixed assets per employee (capital-labor ratios), profits over
equity, and the wage in the parent's home sector (for Germany) or the parent's av-
erage wage per employee (for Sweden). Following Buch et al. (2004) we also include
a count of the number of countries in which an MNE operates to partly control for
potential unobserved parent-level effects.
The parent-specific variables are interacted with indicators of three broad country
group indicators. These regional groupings are the following: Central and Eastern Eu-
ropean countries (CE), industrialized countries (IN ) and developing countries (DV )
(see table 8 for definitions).5 We choose industrialized countries as our reference
group.
Our location-specific variables are intended to capture four different aspects of
the host country: its market size, its relative supply of skilled labor, its labor cost
level, and costs associated with trading and investing in the country. Market size
is an important determinant for the market-seeking motive behind horizontal FDI.
Theoretically, the effect of relative skill supplies is ambiguous (see e.g. Carr, Markusen
and Maskus 2001). Theory predicts that a large difference in relative skill endowments
between the home and host country promotes vertical FDI, while a small difference
5We adopt the CL model after estimating a seven-region nested logit model (not reported)
and testing whether further restrictions significantly alter estimates. We are unable to reject that
parameter estimates for seven regions differ significantly from those for three more aggregate regions
(p-value of .16), and are unable to reject that nesting the remaining three foreign regions (IN, CE

in skill endowments favors horizontal FDI. Moreover, the effects of skill endowments
depend on the size of the market in the host country, since vertical FDI is most
attractive when the host country has a large market at the same time as it is relatively
abundant in unskilled labor (has cheap labor). Horizontal FDI, on the other hand,
is most attractive when the home and host countries are similar both in terms of
relative skill endowments and market size. These insights call for the inclusion of
interaction terms between skill endowments and market size in a regression.
Relative labor and other factor costs may interact with location choice through an
additional channel. One reason for cost differentials of factor inputs is that agglom-
eration forces may push up the price of immobile factors in agglomerated regions.
This may create incentive for vertical FDI to low-cost locations unrelated to the rel-
ative endowments of unskilled labor in the host country (Ekholm and Forslid 2001).
However, it may equally well be the case that MNEs are attracted by the location
advantages that give rise to agglomeration in the first place.
According to theory, the effect of trade costs is ambiguous as well. High trade
costs promote horizontal FDI since they make exports from the home country costly,
while low trade costs promote vertical FDI since they make exports from the host
country back to the home country inexpensive.
We proxy market size with a country's GDP, and trade and investment costs with
geographical distance between the capital cities of the host and home countries.6
We use a country's share of population with completed higher education to measure
relative skill endowments (taken from Barro and Lee (2001) data). The level of labor
costs is approximated by the wage cost for skilled blue-collar workers.7 The choice
of this particular type of labor has been motivated by the desire to find a group that
might be considered reasonably homogenous and one that is likely to be important
for all firms in the sample.
GDP per capita is included as an additional location-specific variable. This vari-
able may partly capture the host country's relative abundance of physical and human
capital, partly its level of technology and infrastructure, and partly income effects
on consumer demand. Because of the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect, it may also
capture the host country's relative cost level and thereby be an alternative proxy for
the wage level. Furthermore, GDP per capita correlates with the quality of economic
and political institutions--such as property rights protection, checks on corruption
and political stability. The measures of GDP and GDP per capita for are obtained
from the IMF's International Financial Statistics series.
6Geographical distance is measured as the greater circle distance from Berlin and Stockholm,
respectively.
7This measure has been obtained by using information on occupational wages from the Occupa-
tional Wages around the World (OWW) database (Freeman and Oostendorp 2001). See appendix C
for a more detailed description of the calculations.

5.1 Location of Foreign Affiliates of German MNEs
Table 2 presents conditional logit estimates for Germany. Investments made by the
same MNE in different countries should probably not be treated as mutually inde-
pendent decisions. We therefore control for potential correlations in the error terms
by allowing for clustering over parent observations.8 In table 2 we have defined skill-
scarce (skill-abundant) countries as countries with a lower (higher) share of high
school attainment than Germany (the share of higher school attainment in Germany
is 17.5 percent). To increase the number of observations, we remove median foreign
wages from specifications (2) and (4).
To assess the effect of relative skill endowments, we interact endowments with
an indicator of whether the country is skill abundant or skill scarce compared to
Germany. As discussed previously, theory predicts that differences in relative skill
endowments promote vertical FDI, while similarity in relative skill endowments pro-
motes horizontal FDI. If FDI were mainly vertical, we would expect a negative effect
of skill endowments for both groups. If it were mainly horizontal, we would expect a
positive effect of skill endowments for the skill scarce group and a negative effect of
skill endowments for the skill abundant group. Since theory suggests that the effect
varies depending on the size of the country, we also augment the specifications with
further interactions between relative skill endowments and GDP for the two groups
of skill scarce and skill abundant countries.
Host-country regressors are highly significant across specifications, the only ex-
ception being GDP per capita in some specifications. In particular, GDP levels and
geographical distance serve as strong predictors of FDI (at the one-percent confi-
dence level), reflecting the importance of standard gravity variables for explaining
the pattern of FDI (Brainard 1997, Ekholm 1998, Shatz 2003, Venables and Shatz
2000). Larger GDP (market size) attracts FDI, while geographical distance deters
FDI. In specification (1), for example, a one percent increase in a country's GDP,
ceteris paribus, raises the relative probability of choosing it as a location versus not
investing in this country by about half a percent in a skill scarce country and about .8
8We have also used specifications including region-specific constants. However, the inclusion of
these constants did not alter the results in any important way, which is why we do not report them
in the paper.

percent in a skill abundant country.9 An increase in a country's geographical distance
by one percent, decreases the odds of locating in that country by about .6 percent
(specification 1).
The estimated coefficient of relative skill endowments for skill scarce countries is
positive and significantly different from zero at the one percent level in all specifica-
tions. The estimate for skill abundant countries is also positive, but only significance
in specifications (1) and (3). This finding suggests that German MNEs are skill trac-
ing, i.e. they seek skill-abundant locations in their selection of destinations. Skill
seeking in the group of skill scarce countries is consistent with German FDI being
mainly of the horizontal type. The evidence of skill seeking in the group of skill
abundant countries is weaker. However, the fact that we find evidence of skill tracing
in this group is interesting and may be interpreted in various ways. One possible in-
terpretation is that German MNEs engage in a kind of inverted vertical FDI - instead
of locating parts of the value added chain which are intensive in unskilled labor in
low-wage countries they locate parts intensive in skilled labor in high-wage countries.
Another interpretation is that the result is in fact consistent with German FDI being
mainly of the horizontal type. It might be argued that formal education is a poor
indicator of skill endowments in the case of Germany, since Germany has a more
developed system of apprenticeship than other countries. Taking this into account,
a large part of the group of countries defined as skill abundant vis-`
a-vis Germany
might be better thought of as skill scarce.
As for the interaction terms between skill endowment and country size (measured
by GDP), all estimates are negative. They are all significant for the group of skill
scarce countries, but only significant in specifications (1) and (3) for the group of skill
abundant countries. Higher GDP levels thus seem to be associated with a smaller
impact of skill endowments. This finding is consistent with the predictions of the
knowledge capital model (see Markusen 2002) and the idea that large skill scarce
countries might be as attractive as small skill abundant ones. Applying the point
estimates from specification (1) to numbers for Hungary and India; two examples of
9The relative risk ratio with respect to the coefficient estimate on (log) GDP must account for

where zm,3
denotes the variable skill-scarce location and zm,4
stands for skill-abundant country, and
the estimated coefficients 1
, 6
, and 7
refer to the variables GDPm
and the interactions between
skill endowment and log GDPm
. Looking at a skill-scarce country (zm,4
= 0) with a high school
attainment rate of 15 percent (zm,3
= 15), for instance, our results for specification (1) indicate
that a one percent increase in GDPm
increases the odds of choosing location m versus not choosing
it as a host country by a factor exp[.01 × (.971 - .032 × 15)] = 1.00492. In other words, if the
GDP in country m increases by one percent, the relative probability of choosing that country versus
not choosing it as a location increases by approximately .5 percent. Considering a skill-abundant
country (zm,3
= 0) with 20 percent higher school attainment (zm,4
= 20), on the other hand, results
in a factor of exp[.01 × (.971 - .007 × 20)] = 1.00834.

relatively skill-scare countries with small and large market sizes, respectively; we find
that a unit increase in the skill level (i.e. an increase in the higher school attainment
by one percentage point) in Hungary (India) raises the relative risk ratio of locating
production there by about 15 (7) percent. The same increase in the skill level would
thus have a stronger impact on the relative risk ratio of locating production there for
small Hungary than for large India.
As explained above, we have also included the median wage level of skilled blue-
collar workers to capture the effects of labor costs on the relative attractiveness of
a location (specifications 1 and 3). Conditioning on the availability of labor skills
in the country, an increase in a country's median wage of skilled blue-collar workers
by one percent reduces the odds that a German MNE chooses it as a location for
manufacturing activities by approximately .3 percent. Thus, while there is evidence
of skill tracing conditional on wage levels, higher labor costs still deter German firms
from investing in a country.
In the specifications excluding labor costs, we have many more observations at
hand (specifications 2 and 4). In these specifications, the coefficient estimates for
GDP per capita become negative and significant. This result may reflect the fact that
GDP per capita tends to be highly correlated with wages and therefore may capture
the negative effect of wages found in specifications (1) and (3). Taken together, the
results for median wages of skilled blue-collar workers and GDP per capita suggest
that high wage and cost levels deter German MNEs, controlling for the availability
of skilled labor.
Parent-specific variables need to be interpreted relative to our reference group
of industrialized countries. We exclude German sectoral wages and capital-labor
ratios from specifications (1) and (2) but use a full set of parent-specific variables
in specifications (3) and (4). A parent active in many locations is more likely to be
present in developing countries and less likely to have invested in CEE (CE) compared
to the reference group. Note that the positive estimate for developing countries is
likely to merely reflect the fact that this is the country group with most countries.
This variable has been included only to serve as a control. Generally, the results for
the parent-specific variables should be viewed as descriptive. They all relate to choice
variables at the level of the firm and are therefore endogenously determined along
with location choice.
The parent employment coefficient with respect to CEE countries only becomes
significant when German sectoral wages are excluded. A positive sign indicates that
larger firms are more likely to invest in CEE compared to industrialized countries.
The estimated coefficient in specification (1) implies that an increase in the odds of
an MNE's presence in CEE (compared to its presence in industrialized countries) by
a factor of exp(.01 × .138) = 1.00138 ( .14 percent) goes along with a one-percent
higher employment at the German parent. This correlation is consistent with the
hypothesis that an MNE's presence in low-cost locations in CEE may increase its
competitiveness vis-`
a-vis firms without such presence and therefore creates scope
16
for an expansion of its activities at home. However, it should be noted that this
correlation is not robust across specifications. Moreover, it would also be consistent
with the hypothesis that large firms expand into CEE countries more frequently than
small firms.
Estimated coefficients of the profits per equity ratio are negative and significant
in the CEE country group in specifications (1), (3) and (4). This suggests that
parents with currently relatively low profits compared to domestic competitors are
more likely to have sought cost savings by locating manufacturing production in CEE.
The wage rate in the parent's sector in Germany, included in specifications 3 and 4,
does not exhibit a conclusive correlation pattern with the choice of foreign locations.
Its estimated coefficient is insignificant unless foreign wages are excluded from the
regression.
5.2 Location of Foreign Affiliates of Swedish MNEs
Table 3 presents conditional logit estimates for Sweden. The variables included are
similar to the ones in Table 2. A difference is that instead of sectoral wages in the
home country, we have included the average wage in the Swedish parent. Another
important difference is that parent variables now refer to the entire Swedish part of
the corporation, not just the actual investing firm.
In general, fewer of the estimates based on the Swedish data set turn out signif-
icant; a reflection of the fact that the Swedish data set is much smaller. The only
location-specific variables that are significant across most specifications are the stan-
dard gravity type variables; GDP and geographical distance. In specification (1), a
one percent increase in a country's GDP, ceteris paribus, raises the relative proba-
bility of locating affiliate activity versus not locating affiliate activity in this country
by about .4 percent in a skill scarce country and about .5 percent in a skill abundant
country.10 An increase in a country's geographical distance by one percent decreases
the odds of operating an affiliate there by about 1 percent.
The estimated coefficients of the host country wage level have the same negative
sign as in the German case, although here they are insignificant. The estimated
coefficients of relative skill abundance have the opposite sign compared to the German
case, although again the estimates are insignificant. Still, the latter result implies
that, unlike in the German case, there is no evidence of skill tracing by Swedish
multinationals.
Most of the estimated coefficients of the parent-specific variables are insignificant
as well. One apparent difference compared to the results for Germany, however,
is that there is a positive estimate for the profit-equity ratio with respect to CEE
10Here skill abundance has been defined in relation to Sweden, whose share of "higher school
attainment" is 23.1 percent. Calculating the RRR for a skill abundant country yields exp[.01 ×
(.333 + .008 × 26)] = 1.00543 and for a skill scarce country exp[.01 × (.333 + .009 × 11.6)] = 1.00438,
using the median share of higher school attainment in the two groups of countries.

countries, while it is negative in the German case. It should be noted here, however,
that in the Swedish case the profit-equity ratio relates to the whole corporation
rather than the Swedish parent. Thus, while we found that higher profitability at the
German parent was associated with a decreased probability of being located in CEE
compared to other regions, here we find that higher profitability at the level of the
entire Swedish corporation is associated with an increased probability of being located
in CEE compared to other regions. However, whether higher corporate profitability
is a cause or consequence of production in CEE remains to be investigated.
6 Employment and Wages Across Locations
To assess employment effects of wages across locations, we estimate wage elasticities
of labor demand across locations where the MNEs operate affiliate. The German
data provide no information on firm-level employment by skill groups or occupations.
We therefore only consider total employment at location r. We calculate the factor
share in the total wage bill of MNE i as i,r
= wr
Li,r
/ R
r=1
wr
Li,r
, where wr
is the
employment-weighted regional average of the country-level wages and Li,r
the firm's
employment in region r.11 The Swedish data include the wage bills for both Swedish
parents and foreign affiliates. We divide wage bills by total employment to calculate
country-level wages and to infer wage shares by location.
To obtain interpretable results, we lump the host countries into four country
groups: Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Developing countries (DEV ), Overseas
Industrialized countries (OIN ), and Western European countries (WEU ) (see table 8
in the appendix for definitions). So, together with the home country, we consider
labor demand in five distinct regions. We estimate the resulting system of R - 1 = 4
independent labor share equations for the four foreign regions in iterated seemingly
unrelated regressions. The iterations remove a potential sensitivity of estimates to
our choice of four out of five equations, and seemingly unrelated regressions yield
standard errors that account for cross-equation correlations. We assume labor to be
homogenous within but not across regions. The four-equation system is

The definition of cost shares implies that R

= 1, so that the system can only
be identified for R - 1 independent equations.
11Since individual firms in our samples of 451 German and 92 Swedish parents contribute little
to overall affiliate employment in a region, we consider the potential endogeneity of employment
shares in our weighting procedure as negligible.

estimates (appendix D). Lower entries in parentheses are standard errors from 1,000 bootstraps.
We approximate the MNE's value added at a location with total affiliate turnover.
Potential presence in up to four foreign regions implies that there are up to 15 regional
presence patterns for an MNE (permutations of the absence from none, one, two, or
three regions). Rather than estimating separate equations for each location pattern,
we choose to restrict the coefficients to be equal across all groups of potential patterns
of foreign presence. To do so, we stack the observations by setting all variables to zero
for an absent MNE and add according region indicators. The indicators take a value
of one for all regions from which an MNE is absent to correct the intercept accordingly.
This procedure improves efficiency, collapses the up to 15 sets of estimates into one
consistently estimated four-equation system, and ultimately provides us with one
single matrix of estimates for wage elasticities of regional labor demands.
Tables 9 and 10 in the appendix show the labor share estimates from the four-
equation system, and table 11 presents the coefficient estimates of absence indicators
for both countries. When significant, the estimates of the absence indicators reveal
that absence is correlated with high regional wage bills (among the present MNEs).
In neither firm sample are there any MNEs with a simultaneous presence in all four

foreign regions.12
Tables 4 and 5 present cross-wage elasticities of labor demand derived from the
multi-location cost function estimates (tables 9 and 10). The estimates show the
percentage responses of regional employment to one-percent wage increases by region.
The upper standard errors reported in tables 4 and 5 are from Anderson and
Thursby (1986) confidence interval estimates (see appendix D), based on hypothesized
Gaussian errors. We also obtain standard errors from 1,000 bootstraps to remove
dependence on distributional assumptions and report those as the lower entries in
tables 4 and 5. We judge the significance of point estimates on the basis of the
bootstrapped standard errors.
Concavity of the cost function in wages requires that labor demand elasticities on
the diagonal be negative. Assuringly, tables 4 and 5 do exhibit negative elasticities
on the diagonal (except for one insignificant point estimate for affiliates of German

21
MNEs located in developing countries (DEV )). Elasticities off the diagonal can have
mixed signs and provide an indication of factor substitutability (positive sign) and
factor complementarity (negative sign) across locations.
Elasticities of home-country employment with respect to foreign wages (first row)
and elasticities of foreign employment with respect to home country wages (first col-
umn) are all positive in (tables 4 and 5). In both the German and Swedish sample,
the estimated cross-wage elasticities are significant at least at the ten percent level
for all regions except developing countries. In the larger German sample, several esti-
mates are significant at the one-percent level. The positive and significant estimates
suggest that jobs at foreign locations substitute for employment at the German and
Swedish parents. Parent employment seems to be the most sensitive to wages in
Western European host countries. At the sample mean, a one percent lower wage
in Western European host countries is associated with .11 percent smaller employ-
ment in German parents. Similarly, a one percent lower wage in Western European
countries is associated with .23 percent smaller employment in Swedish parents.
The finding that affiliate employment in other high-income countries is the stron-
gest substitute for parent employment is in line with results from previous studies
(e.g. Brainard and Riker 2001 and Konings and Murphy 2001). For Germany and
Sweden, home employment is most sensitive to wages in Western European host
countries. Whereas Konings and Murphy (2001) find no or only weak evidence of
substitution between parent employment in EU-15 and affiliate employment in CEE,
our results do suggest such a relationship. German MNEs that face a one percent
higher wage at home are estimated to increase their employment in CEE by 2.2
percent. Swedish MNEs that face a one percent higher wage at home are estimated
to increase their employment in CEE with 1.8 percent. A one percent wage reduction
in host countries in CEE reduce German parent employment by about .05 percent
and Swedish parent employment by about .09 percent.
For both German and Swedish MNEs, a one-percent larger wage gap between
CEE and the home country results in significantly stronger employment effects in
CEE than in the home country. The different magnitudes reflect labor productivity
differences between the home country and CEE as captured by the estimated multi-
location cost function. A substitution of parent jobs for affiliate jobs in CEE requires
a more than proportional number of hires of lower-productivity workers in CEE.
Moreover, a one-percent change in German or Swedish wages implies a considerably
larger absolute change in wage levels and can therefore have a stronger effect on
affiliate employment in CEE than a one-percent wage change in CEE has on parent
employment.
Most of the cross-wage elasticities between different foreign locations are insignifi-
cant. For German MNEs, there are a few instances of negative cross-wage elasticities
significant at the 10 percent level: the elasticities of affiliate employment in develop-
ing countries with respect to wages in Western Europe and CEE, and the elasticity
of affiliate employment in CEE with respect to wages in developing countries. These

estimates could be taken as evidence of complementarity between workers employed
in different host countries. Since they all involve developing countries and Europe,
this suggests that the activities carried out by German MNEs in developing countries
might be vertically related to the operations at foreign affiliates in Europe.
In order to relate elasticities to absolute employment responses, we calculate the
implied change in employment from a one percent larger wage gap between regions.
To do so, we multiply the elasticities of labor demand with the respective total sample
employment figures from table 1.13 Focusing on CEE, we find that a one percent larger
wage gap between Germany and locations in CEE reduces employment in German
parents by 930 jobs and increases employment in CEE affiliates by 5,060 jobs. A
one percent larger gap between Sweden and locations in CEE reduces employment
in Swedish parents by 140 jobs and increases employment in CEE affiliates by 260
jobs.
7 Conclusion
The analysis of location choices and employment responses among German and
Swedish MNEs reveals striking differences as well as similarities. For both firm
samples, the strongest predictors of location choice are host country GDP and geo-
graphical distance from the home country. This result underscores the importance of
standard gravity factors for the pattern of FDI. For both samples, the foreign wage
level is negatively associated with the presence of foreign affiliates, controlling for the
country's relative endowment of skilled labor. A noteworthy difference in location
choices between German and Swedish MNEs is that German MNEs tend to be at-
13Formally, we calculate absolute employment responses to one-percent wage changes at the sam-
ple mean by multiplying the elasticities of labor demand with the respective sample average em-
ployments by region and the number of respective observations in the sample. The latter product
equals total employment.

tracted to countries with relatively abundant supplies of skilled labor, while there is
no evidence of such skill tracing for Swedish MNEs. In this sense, our results lend
some support to recent findings that German firms locate relatively skill-intensive
activities abroad (Marin 2004). However, our German data lack explicit information
on the skill composition of labor forces and do not permit a more detailed analysis.
Given their respective location choices, German and Swedish firms exhibit sim-
ilar responses of labor demands to international wage differentials. For both home
countries, we find only positive estimates of the cross-wage elasticities. This implies
that jobs at parent firms and jobs at foreign affiliates tend to substitute for one an-
other. For both sets of firms, we find that parent employment is most responsive
to wages in other Western European countries. However, our results also indicate
significant substitutability between parent workers and affiliate workers in Central
and Eastern Europe. While parent employment is less responsive to a one-percent
wage change in CEE than to a one-percent wage change in Western Europe, the
employment effects of the wage differentials between the home countries and CEE
may be economically the more important effects. The wage differential between the
home countries Germany and Sweden on the one hand and CEE on the other hand
is considerably larger than the wage differential between these countries and other
Western European countries.
The estimated labor demand elasticities apply to marginal wage changes across
locations in which MNEs own manufacturing affiliates. An evaluation as to how large
wage changes would affect employment in different locations is beyond the scope of
this paper. Such an assessment would require the treatment of endogenous location
choices in estimating the employment responses of MNEs.

Appendix
A The BuBa FDI data
We use FDI data for the years 1989 through 2001 at the firm level from BuBa's direk
(Direktinvestitionenstatistik) database. Panels of both individual parents and affiliates are
identifiable during the sub period 1996 through 2001. Exchange rate information at the
balance sheet closing dates is available. We derive two data sets from the original data.
1. Raw data. The raw fdi data are available as a three-dimensional panel, where ob-
servations can be thought of as indexed by parent i, foreign affiliate u, and year t.
Every observation in the raw data corresponds to a single "K3 questionnaire" (K3
meaning reported outward FDI from Germany).
2. Parent-host-country aggregates. Using the raw fdi data, we derive a three-dimensio-
nal panel indexed by parent, host country of affiliate and year. Whenever a parent
carries out multiple investments in a particular country, we aggregate these invest-
ments into one observation. We interpret investments of the same parent firm in
different countries as independent location decisions conducted by independently op-
erating parts of the firm (but restrict standard errors to by clustered by parent
company). Every observation in this data set can be thought of as indexed by i, j, t
where i denotes the German parent, j denotes the host country, and t the year.
Currency conversion and deflation. We convert all economic data of foreign affiliates
into euro (EUR) and deflate them. In BuBa's original direk data, all information on
foreign affiliates is reported in German currency, using the exchange rate at the closing
date of the foreign affiliate's balance sheet. We apply the following deflation and currency
conversion method to all financial variables. (i) We use the market exchange rate on the
end-of-month day closest to an affiliate's balance sheet closing date to convert the DEM
figures into local currency for every affiliate. This reverses the conversion applied to the
questionnaires at the date of reporting. (ii) A deflation factor for every country deflates the
foreign-currency financial figures to the December-1998 real value in local currency. (iii) For
each country, the average of all end-of-month exchange rates vis-`
a-vis the DEM between
January 1996 and December 2001 is used as a proxy for the purchasing power parity of
foreign consumption baskets relative to the DEM. All deflated local-currency figures are
converted back to DEM using this purchasing-power proxy. The resulting deutschmark
(DEM) figures are then converted into euro figures at the rate 1.95583 (the conversion rate
at inception of the euro in 1999).
We use the foreign countries' CPIs (Consumer Price Indices from the IMF's Interna-
tional Financial Statistics) to deflate the figures. Whenever a country's CPI is not available
from IFS but the main currency used in that country is issued in some other country, we
use the CPI of the currency-issuing country. The CPI deflation factors for all countries are
rebased to unity at year-end 1998.
25
B String matches and the BuBa USTAN data
We string-match companies in the BuBa ustan (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) data set by
name to companies in the Buba fdi data set in order to obtain information on the domestic
operations of German MNEs. Every firm in Germany who draws a bill of exchange in a given
year is required by law to report its balance sheet to BuBa, who collects this information in
its ustan database when the bill of exchange is rediscounted. The database is considered
the most comprehensive source of balance sheet data for companies outside the financial
sector in Germany, and includes companies from the financial sector. The draft of bills of
exchange remains a common form of payment in Germany. However, increases in BuBa's
value threshold for reporting resulted in several drops of the sample and a marked decrease
in the year 2001. For the year 2000, on which we base the current paper, we successfully
string match a total of 1,731 ustan firms to fdi firms. However, only 108 of those firms
provide consolidated balance sheet information.
We extract ustan information on the balance sheet total, equity (including retained
profits), profits, (non-financial) fixed assets, liabilities, the number of employees, and
turnover. We use the German CPI (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics)
to deflate the DEM (EUR) financial figures in the ustan data set. The CPI deflation fac-
tor is rebased to unity at year-end 1998. Deflation to year-end 1998 values makes financial
figures comparable to the purchasing-power-parity inspired conversion method for our for-
eign financial figures. The end of 1998 is the mid point of our 1996-2001 data. In addition,
the introduction of the euro in early 1999 makes December 1998 a natural reference date.
For robustness checks, we are interested in German MNEs who have only foreign but
no domestic affiliates (`stand-alone' parents). For this purpose, we string-match companies
in the BuBa fdi data set by name and location to companies in the firm register of the
association of German credit agencies Verband der Vereine Creditreform, as available in
its database markus. We use the information on ownership shares from markus to infer
whether and how domestic firms form part of corporate trees to which BuBa Outward fdi
firms belong. If no domestic affiliate is found for a BuBa Outward fdi firm, we label the
fdi firm a `stand-alone' parent.
C Occupational Wages
We use wage data from the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database
(Freeman and Oostendorp 2001). The data contain wages for 161 occupations in over 150
countries from 1983 to 1999 (the OWW data in turn are based on the ILO October Inquiry
database). The OWW wages refer to average monthly wage rates for male workers. We
use the 1999 data, multiply the monthly wages by twelve to approximate annual earnings
for our annualized translog estimation, and aggregate the 161 occupations into five broad
occupation categories comparable to those in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999).14 The
occupational categories are: O1 engineers, professionals, and managers; O2 technicians
and technical white-collar workers; O3 other white-collar workers; O4 skilled blue-collar
14We follow Freeman and Oostendorp's (2001) recommendation and use their base calibration
with lexicographic weighting for the aggregate wages.

with progressing number labels.
