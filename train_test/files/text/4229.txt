Introduction
One goal of linguists is to decipher the mystery of the logical
problem of language learning, one example being how a nor-
mal 5-year-old human child acquires his or her mother tongue
(cf. Brown, 1973). Another important aim of modern linguis-
tic theory is to come up with language universals--the prin-
ciples according to which all human beings speak a language
(see Greenberg, 1966).Although it is important in the linguis-
tic behavior, the domain of phonology in second/foreign lan-
guage learning and pidgin and creole languages has received
little attention compared with the other aspects of language.
Years of investigation have revealed that child language, sec-
ond/foreign language learning, and pidgin and creole lan-
guages are, more or less, related in terms of processing. Many
phenomena in these fields have been shown to be similar
(Bickerton, 1995; Cook, 1993; Holm, 2000; Schumann, 1978;
Washabaugh, 1977). Moreover, research on processes of pid-
ginization and creolization has led to important advances in a
number of areas of applied linguistics and theoretical linguis-
tics (cf. Holm, 2000). In this study, the strategies used by
Saudi learners of English, particularly with regard to the
acquisition of the closing diphthongs // and /e/ as in home
and lane, respectively, are compared with the process of cre-
olization of two speakers of Broad Jamaican Creole (JC;
Bailey, 1966). The similarities between the two creole
speakers and Saudi learners of English will be highlighted
drawing on the assumption that "the dynamics by which pid-
gins and creoles come into being and the development of the
L2 learner's interlanguage might be governed by the same
factors" (Cook, 1993, p. 69). In other words, in both situa-
tions, the behavior of those concerned is constrained by the
principles of Universal Grammar, a genetically determined
pre-disposition for language. Furthermore, it is also assumed
that foreign/second language learning and historical change
are significantly linked, in such a way that accounting for
these learning situations without historical explanations may
lack credibility. Thus, another aim of this study is to see to
what extent the behavior of the speakers of the Broad JC and
Saudi learners of English exhibits facts of historical change.

Acquisition of the Closing Diphthongs
// and /e/ in English L2 and Jamaican
Creole: A Comparative Study
Ahmed Mousa1
Abstract
This study investigates the claim that the strategies used by second/foreign language learners are, more or less, the same as
those used by speakers of pidgin/creole languages. To this end, the speech of two speakers of the well-known Broad Jamaican
Creole is compared with the performance of Saudi learners of English, with respect to the pronunciation of the closing
diphthongs // and /e/. The results show that the above claim is valid. Also, the behavior of the two groups corroborates
that of child language, which will be taken as external evidence that adds to the existent literature of the logical problem of
language learning. The behavior of the speakers in the three domains (i.e., L1, L2, and pidgin/creole languages) goes hand in
hand with norms of historical change. That is, the two diphthongs have historically developed from the monophthongs used
as substitutes. In addition, the centrality component in these diphthongs is a marked parameter, which is yet to be set before
they could be mastered. The substitutes made by the speakers of Jamaican Creole and by Arab learners are the same chosen
by the child.

with pidginization/creolization has attracted a significant
number of linguists. This is so because researchers have
come to realize that to understand the behavior of early and
late second/foreign language learning, an appreciation of the
processes involved in pidginization/depidginization, cre-
olization/decreolization is a key issue (McLaughlin, 1987).
For instance, Baxter, Lucchesi, and Guimaraes (1997), in
their investigation of the Brazilian spoken dialect of Helvecia,
observed a series of parallels with structures in early stages
of L1 Portuguese acquisition.
In a comparison between the decreolization of the
Guyanese Creole negation system and the acquisition of
English negation by Spanish speakers, Schumann (1978)
found that the overall movement along the linguistic contin-
uum in the two operations involved a rule change from a
basilect/basilang pre-verbal negation to the target English
post-copula auxiliary negation. Furthermore, it was observed
that the above rule change in the situations was accomplished
by identical linguistic processes--the replacement of surface
forms and the restructuring of underlying units. Likewise, in
the depidginization of Hawaiian Pidgin English, as reported
by Bickerton and Odo (1976), a continuum of development
occurs, which is similar to that witnessed in decreolization
and second language acquisition.
Patrick-Andre (2006) has come to the conclusion that
many of the features found in Haitian French-lexifier creoles
do occur in L2 French and other interlanguages as a result of
L1 transfer and other acquisition processes. The investiga-
tion includes word order within the noun phrase, pronominal
clitics, absence of copula, grammatical gender, and verb
movement. The major claim of the model of creole genesis
advocated in the study, which he calls gradualist/second lan-
guage acquisition, is that creole genesis does not involve any
specific mental processes or strategies other than those
attested in ordinary second language acquisition. In Lefebvre,
White, and Jourdan (2003), a number of second language
researchers and creolists engage in dialogues that focus on
the processes characterizing various stages of L2 acquisition
and creole genesis, such as relexification and transfer from
L1 and their role in the initial state. The dialogues also cover
morphological, phonological, semantic, and syntactic prop-
erties of interlanguage grammar and creole grammars. Their
findings lend support to the view that the same processes are
found to shape the initial stages of the two situations.
The reader is reminded that we are conducting a research
on the acquisition of two closing diphthongs, namely, //
and /e/. Hence, it will be seen whether our findings corrobo-
rate those of the aforementioned researchers. However, a
brief account of diphthongs is necessary. Diphthongs are
described as combinations of two vowel sounds within a
single syllable. The production of a diphthong involves the
gliding of the speech organs from a first vocalic element (i.e.,
starting point) to a second differently articulated element,
which constitutes the target to which the transition is made
(see Gimson, 1980; Ladefoged, 1982; Roach, 2000). Thus,
for the production of the word load, which contains the clos-
ing diphthong //, as illustrated in Figure 1, for instance, the
vowel position for the beginning of this is the one for schwa
//; the lips may be slightly rounded anticipating the glide
toward the second element //, for which there is quite
noticeable lip-rounding. Likewise, in the production of the
closing diphthong /e/ as in pain, the glide begins from
slightly below the half-close front position, with the mid
vowel /e/ and with spread lips as illustrated in Figure 1.
This gymnastics has proven to be problematic in L1 (Hua
& Dodd, 2000; Santos, 2007), L2 (Hung, 2004; Randell,
2004), African American Vernacular English (AAVE; Bailey
& Thomas, 1998; Rickford, 1999), and pidgin and creole lan-
guages (Cassidy & Le Page, 1967; Holm, 2000). We are
mainly concerned with the acquisition of the above closing
diphthongs by Arab L1 learners of English and speakers of
JC.
The abovementioned continuum of development is also
reflected on in this study as will be shown in the discussion.
In addition, an attempt will be made to explain why errors
take place in the acquisition of the two diphthongs under
study, with reference to historical sound change. An effort
will be made to illustrate the learners' deviation from native
speakers' norms with respect to the pronunciation of these
diphthongs, using the framework of Dependency Phonology
(Anderson & Ewen, 1987). However, before we go further,
an account of diphthongs in Arabic and in JC is worth
outlining.
Generally speaking, Hejazi Arabic (like standard Arabic
and almost most varieties of Arabic) does not have diph-
thongs, and the diphthong-like combinations [aw] and [aj]
are realized as [o:] and [e:], respectively, as in (1):
1. [yo:m] day, [o:m] swimming, [be:t] house and [de:n]
debt (cf. Mousa, 1994).
We can argue that [aw] and [aj] in Arabic are not diph-
thongs, based on the fact that [w] and [j] have consonantal
status, as in (2):
2.[ajn] eye versus [ajjana] "he allocated," [qaws]
baw versus [qawwasa] "he bent," [bard], cold versus
[barrada] "he cooled," and [mil] salt versus
[mallaa] "he salted" (cf. Mousa, 1994).
Figure 1. Illustration of the glides involved in // and /e/.
Mousa 3
Notice that the glides [w] and [j] behave exactly like other
consonants in that they germinate in the causative case.
Contineau (in Alaoui, 1987) considers [w] and [j] in the pre-
vious examples as positional variants of [u] and [i], respec-
tively. A consequence of this view is to disregard the
consonantal function of [w] and [j]. That is, if we follow
Contineau, we should ignore the function of glides as fully
fledged elements of root morphemes as in such words as
[abja] white and [waqu:d] fuel. Equally, we will have to
ignore their function as constituents in the canonical struc-
ture of Standard Arabic, according to McCarthy (1981).
Another counter-argument is that /i/, j and /u/, w cannot be
variants of the same segment because they can occur side by
side (Trubetzkoy, 1949). Furthermore, there are minimal
pairs that indicate that /i/, j and /u/, w are different pairs.
Consider the examples in (3):
3.[wafij] loyal [waafi:] exhausted
[abij] "he who does not" [abi:] "my father"
"tolerate humiliation"
The articulation of diphthongs, then, is clearly alien to
Arab learners. Although [aw] in [jawm] day and [aj] in [bajt]
house may sound similar to house and fine in English, the
articulation of these diphthongs in the two languages is dif-
ferent, as Mitchell and El-Hassan (1989) have shown. They
argue that the second elements in these two diphthongs are
articulated as if they were the consonantal [j] and [w], which
are stronger and fuller in Arabic. In English, the second ele-
ments are, however, very short.
As for JC, it has four diphthongs: /ai/, /ou/, /ie/, and /
uo/. The first two, according to Cassidy and Le Page (1980)
and Devonish and Harry (2004) (cf. table2), would approx-
imate the vowels in the pronunciation of such English
words as "mice" and "cow," respectively. The second two
(/uo/ and /ie/), according to Cassidy and Le Page (1980)
and Devonish and Harry (2004), involve a combination of
the high vowel /i/ or /u/ with the mid vowel corresponding
to its backness or frontness (i.e., /e/ and /o/). This is dis-
played in the pronunciation of /kien/ "cane" and /guot/
"goat," respectively.
According to Devonish (2006), the reversal witnessed in
the Received Pronunciation (RP) closing diphthong // "is
systematic and is a generalization of a very limited variation
in normal Jamaican speech between /uo/ and /ou/ in a small
number of words all of which end in /l/" (p. 78). Specifically,
/uol/ "old," /buol/ "bowl," and /kuol/ "cold" have /oul/, /
boul/, and /koul/, respectively, as alternative forms.
JC has been affected by the tendency of the phonemic
reduction that languages with Pidgin origins had gone
through (cf. Hall, 1966). The above creole diphthongs ema-
nated from several steps of this creole development that
affected the vowel inventory of the language. Lalla (1983)
reports that JC had gone through three stages of change,
which are instigated by the processes of the creolization of
the former Pidgin language. The first two stages had culmi-
nated in the reduction of the whole vocalic system. Thus,
during the first stage of development, the language lost
vowel length distinction. The second stage witnessed the
merging of vowels, which led to the reduction of quality
distinction. This is clearly noticed in that "the distinction in
quality between, say close and mid-close front vowel /i, /
or close and mid-close back /u, / are not usually preserved"
(Nývlt, 2012, p. 29). In fact, the first element in each of the
Jamaican diphthongs is indicative of this lack of
distinction.
Universalists argue that vowels that are less common in
the world languages, including centralized //, //, and //,
are generally absent in creoles (Beckford-Wassink, 1999).
Hall (1966) also suggests that less common front and back
rounded vowels, such as /y/ and /oe/, tend to lose their front-
ness or roundness in French-based creoles. Thus, /y/ is
replaced by the more common/i/ or /u/ and /oe/ by the more
common /e/ or /o/ in words of French origin. We take that as
indication of the adoption of more universal vowels. One can
see that the above Jamaican diphthongs are clearly an illus-
tration of this fact.
The third and last stage of development resulted in length-
ening and diphthongization of certain vowel phonemes of
creole. By way of illustration, the mid-close front /e/ and the
mid-close back/o/ were prolonged to become /e:/ and /o:/,
respectively, and eventually developed the on-glides /ie/ and
/uo/ (cf. Alleyne, 1980) as shown in table1. Nývlt (2012)
presents a list of lexical items from JC, together with the way
they are pronounced in RP, in which one can notice that
Jamaican speakers do not really abide by vowel quality dis-
tinction. Table 2 illustrates two examples, one for the RP /e/
and the other for //, and how they are realized in JC.
Although some linguists argue that the diphthongs con-
cerned are in fact monophthongs, which may have diphthon-
gal realization (Veatch, 1991; Wells, 19731), most researchers
classify them with diphthongs (Alleyne, 1980; Cassidy & Le

Finally, the diphthongal status of the JC diphthongs in
question has been acoustically confirmed by Beckford-
Wassink (1999) who observes that there is a difference
between monophthongals /e:/ and /o:/ and diphthongals /ie/
and /uo/. According to the researcher, "the downgliding
diphthong [i.e., /ie/] displays rather slight movement down
the peripheral track of the left system boundary combined
with movement toward the centre of acoustic space.
Monophthongal [e:] shows little movement in either F1 or
F2" (pp. 134-135).
As for /uo/, Beckford-Wassink takes it to be
typically a centring or downgliding diphthong which shows a
rise in F2 on the order of 100 Hz or more lowering in vowel
height accompanied by a rise in F2. The monophthongal variant
/o:/ typically exhibits very little change in F1. (p. 157)
Informants
This section details the informants who formed the sources
of the data of this study.
Jamaican Informants
The informants are two speakers of what is called the Broad
JC (Bailey, 1966) of nearly the same age. The first one, Mr.
Mike (the barber henceforth), is from Hanover in the west of
Jamaica. He migrated to Britain when he was 18 years old.
Today, he is 61 years old. He is a barber in Moss Side,
Manchester, England. Most of his customers are West Indian,
old and young. He uses the same language (Broad JC) at
work, home, and everywhere. He is always in touch with the
West Indian people. He has little education. He left school
before the age of 18, and his reading and writing are not
perfect.
The second informant, Mr. Norman (the driver hence-
forth), is from St. Mary in the north of Jamaica. He migrated
to Britain when he was 17. Today, he is 59 years old. He
worked in two factories in Manchester, as a dry cleaner, and
as a carpet fitter before he became a taxi driver, which is his
present job. He also studied for a while in Jamaica and took
a course in reading and writing in Manchester. This means
that he dealt, and is still dealing with, different people.
Accordingly, his language is expected to be influenced more
than that of the first informant.
Saudi Learners of English
The second category of participants in this study includes
60 native speakers of Hejazi Urban Dialect (HUD), a vari-
ety of Arabic spoken in the urban areas of the Western
Province of Saudi Arabia, mainly Makkah, Madinah, and
Jeddah. They were divided into three groups, 20 in each.
None of them had lived in an English-speaking country
before the time of study. The first group consisted of pupils
at the third year of intermediate school. Their age ranged
from 14 to 16 years. They had been studying English for 3
years, 4 hr a week. The second group was pupils of the third
year at secondary school. They were between 17 and 18
years of age. They had been exposed to English for 6 years
at a frequency of 4 hr a week. The third group was univer-
sity undergraduate students (third-year level). They studied
different subjects. They had been studying English for 9
academic years.
Data Collection
Regarding Jamaican English, data were gathered in three
ways. The author once lived with his Jamaican informants
for 1 year and therefore was able to observe a great deal of
the properties of their speech. Second, he recorded their
casual speech with their permission. Third, in the process, he
gave them separately a list of words and sentences carrying
the diphthongs under study to read. However, one fact is
worth mentioning. Actually, it was not the intention of the
author to use the Jamaican data for research. Rather, it was
the author's first time to hear this mode of speech as he was
used to hearing American and British English only until he
accidentally came across this variety. After he had left them
back home and started teaching English, he discovered that
his Arab learners pronounced the above two diphthongs in
the same way as the two Jamaican informants. It was this
similarity of behavior that instigated the present study. This
is why we do not have a unified methodology, as the pur-
poses of data collection in the two groups are different. Thus,
when the author decided to collect data for the purpose of
research, the task was more organized, and the data were
enormous compared with the data from the Jamaican speak-
ers who were no longer in contact with the author. It is hoped
that the bulk of research on creole languages, the least of
which are cited in this investigation, will consolidate our
arguments and make up for the paucity of data with regard to
the Jamaican informants. It should be mentioned that the JC
transcriptions in this study are based on Cassidy (1961) and
Cassidy and Le Page (1967), and the RP counterparts on
Gimson (1980) and Roach (2000).
As for the Arab learners of English, data elicitation
involved an experiment with three phases: recognition task,
production task, and description of pictures. In the produc-
tion task, a list containing 1,012 words (containing monoph-
thongs and diphthongs) in isolation and in carrier sentences
was prepared and given to the learners to read. They were
instructed to read silently the words and sentences in ques-
tion twice before actually reading them out. Their utterances
were recorded in a sound-treated room in the language labo-
ratory at the English Language Center, King Abdulaziz
University, Jeddah. Recordings of individual participants
were done on separate tapes. Recognition task involved two
Mousa 5
phases. In the first phase, a list of 172 word pairs containing
minimal pairs and pairs of similar words were recorded by a
native speaker of English who worked as a professional lan-
guage instructor. Learners had to listen to the pairs and judge
whether the relevant pairs consisted of similar or different
words. In the second phase, a list of 100 word sets, each of
which contained 3 phonetically similar words, was prepared
and recorded on a tape by a professional native speaker. The
list was handed out to the learners to read silently. They were
then instructed to listen to each set and identify the word read
out from each group after a short interval between the sets
and the word to identify. The learners were then presented
with 104 pictures and instructed to name objects and describe
entities or sequences (events). Their utterances were recorded
in a sound-treated room.
Transcribing and codifying data were done by the
researcher himself, then checked by trained transcribers and
a phonologist at the University of Bangor, North Wales. Data
were coded manually to identify the diphthongs involved.
For reference regarding Jamaican talk of the participants,
Cassidy (1961), Cassidy and Le Page (1967), Bailey (1966),
and Holm (2000) were consulted. As for the Arabic speakers,
the author referred to Basalamah (1990) and to his intuition
as a native speaker of the dialect spoken by the Arab partici-
pants. Data were analyzed with reference to the dependency
framework (Anderson & Ewen, 1987).
Results
Almost all participants (when speaking casually, in their
attempt to pronounce the test words and when describing the
pictures in the case of Saudi learners) have persistently pro-
duced /o:/ for // and /e:/ for /e/, as indicated in Tables 3
and 4, respectively. For instance, the Saudi learners fail to
come up with the closing diphthong // necessary for the
production of such words as home, hope, coat, rope, and so
on. Instead, they opt for the monophthong /o:/, thus behaving
in accordance with their tendency in the production of diph-
thong-like combination [aw] in Arabic, as mentioned
earlier.
The learners also treat words such as rain, lane, train, and
so on, which are pronounced with the diphthong /e/, in the
same way Arabic-speaking people treat the diphthong-like
combination in [aj]. That is, they produce the monophthong
/e:/. Table 3 displays a sample of Saudi learners' pronuncia-
tion of these English diphthongs. Thus, one would have the
impression of initially ascribing our learners' error in the
pronunciation of these two diphthongs to transfer from L1.
Table 4, which contains examples of the Jamaican infor-
mants' pronunciation of the same diphthongs, suggests that
despite the fact that /uo/ and /ie/ are expected to be used by
the two speakers as potential substitutes for the diphthongs in
question (thus complying with the norm of the Broad JC), the
speakers opt for the same substitutes witnessed in the speech
of Saudi learners, /o:/ and /e:/. The use of these two vowels
by the informants may indicate that /uo/ and /ie/ are marked,
as they require on-glides in their combination. The reader
will remember that these Broad JC's diphthongs are reported
to have emerged from /o:/ and /e:/, respectively. Thus, it will
be significant if speakers from different linguistic back-
grounds and learning situations opt for the same sound sub-
stitution. In what follows, an attempt will be made to find out
whether this is a uniform practice in the acquisition of the
above closing diphthongs.

Discussion
The speech of our Jamaican informants as well as that of the
Saudi learners manifests deviations from RP norms in the
production of English diphthongs, especially the above two
closing diphthongs. In what follows, an account of their
behavior is outlined.
Although the Broad JC does have the back, mid-rounded
opening diphthong /uo/ as a recent on-glide development of the
stereotype /o:/ (Alleyne, 1980), which is pronounced in such
words as show, nose, boat, and so on, our informants pro-
nounced coat, road, woe, going, and open with the latter, that is,
with the monophthong /o:/. An instant interpretation one can
give here is that our informants do not show any sign of moving
toward the RP norm.2 However, the use of a long vowel does, at
least, reflect the informants' awareness that the vowel in ques-
tion is not simple; that is, they seem to have realized that they
are dealing with a complex vowel. However, instead of coming
up with the glide associated with the production of a diphthong,
they chose to lengthen the equivalent of the second element of
the diphthong concerned. In other words, this diphthong con-
sists of two centralized vowels, a schwa // and a mid high cen-
tralized //, and both seem to be lacking from the vocalic system
of JC, as the predominating vowel pattern in West African lan-
guages (which is expected to have constituted the original vowel
systems of the Atlantic Creoles [Holm, 2000]) does not contain
them. As we will explain later, the first element does not have
any locational information. The second element, //, contains a
centrality component dependent on a high-rounded articulatory
configuration. An explanation of why our informants chose to
produce the cardinal vowel /o:/ as a realization of this diphthong
will be given, using the principles of Dependency Phonology
outlined in Anderson and Ewen (1987).
According to Chomsky and Halle (1968) in the standard
model, a feature can either be present or absent in a feature
matrix describing a particular segment. That is, for each feature
used, either (+) or (-) is assigned to it. Chomsky and Halle
(1968) claim that the use of binary features is "the natural way
of indicating whether or not an item belongs to a particular cat-
egory" (p. 297). At least two deficiencies could be detected in
this approach (i.e., mode of notation). On one hand, these fea-
tures, which describe a vowel, are unordered. This indicates
that there is no structural relationship among them. Therefore,
by using this mode of representation, we cannot express hierar-
chical intrasegmental relationships that we have isolated to
account for our learners'and informants'behavior. On the other
hand, if the feature matrix contains only the minus values, then
one would have the impression that either there is no phonetic
content or calculate the symmetries that result from the use of
the plus value for the same features. Take, for example, the rep-
resentation of [e] and [] in the standard model:
·
· high
·
· low
This representation makes use of the height and lowness
parameters, but these articulations cannot be read off directly
from the representation itself. And it does not matter whether
you start with low or high, because no structural (hierarchi-
cal) relationship between the features is assumed. The depen-
dency notations, however, make use of the unary features
with structural relations rendering the phonetic content of the
segment in question, as will be seen later.
The same failure in the production of the relevant glide in
the pronunciation of the front, mid, unrounded closing diph-
thong /e/ persists. Thus, the words lay, face, razor, and so
on are pronounced with the monophthong /e:/ by our infor-
mants. In fact, with the exception of /a/, /a/, and //, diph-
thongs in RP are realized as long vowels both in the speech
of our Jamaican informants and Saudi learners. In the latter's
speech, words such as home, hope, both, coat, and so on
were all produced with the monophthong /o:/, whereas words
such as rain, stain, state, train, safe, and so on were articu-
lated with the monophthong /e:/. Perhaps it is helpful to men-
tion that the elements of the diphthongs /e/, //, //, //,
and /e/ are marked for these two groups. Our Arab learners
do not have centralized vowels or the mid high vowel in their
vocalic system; therefore, almost all English words bearing
these vowels were pronounced with the nearest vowels in
their phonemic inventory (cf. Mousa, 1994). Likewise, JC
does not have centralized vowels, and although /e/ is part of
its phonological system, its existence in the diphthongs /e/
and /e/ does not seem to be helpful (cf. Table 4). In what
follows, the errors in the pronunciation of // and /e/ are
illustrated using Dependency Phonology as a mode of repre-
sentation (Anderson & Ewen, 1987).
RP // is characterized by the fact that there is little--if
any--tongue gesture during the production of this complex
segment (cf. Alaoui, 1987). This is because the schwa, the
first element, is a central (neutral) configuration. The second
element involves the same process with little increase of lip-
rounding as the diphthong is articulated. That is, there seems
to be no difference of tongue position between the elements
// and //. Because centrality as a component is not available
in the vowel space of Hejazi Arabic (cf. Basalamah, 1990;
Ingham, 1971; Mousa, 1994), we would expect that this
diphthong would pose a problem to our learners and that its
learning would take place late. Indeed, this diphthong was
pronounced as [o:] at a high error percentage (cf. Mousa,
1994). By the same token, we can argue that this diphthong
will not be an easy target for speakers of JC whose vocalic
system lacks the two elements that constitute it. Let us again
consider the phonetic content of the segment produced (i.e.,
[o:]), to be able to compare it with //, the target. By so
doing, we would like to hypothesize about the strategy that
our informants as well as our Arab learners seem to have
resorted to, being informed by their phonological system and
interphonological grammar, respectively. Consider the repre-
sentation in Figure 2.
Mousa 7
Notice that the element to the left of /v/ does not have any
locational information. The second element contains a cen-
trality component dependent on a high-rounded articulatory
configuration. As mentioned earlier, both gestures do not
occupy a point in the vowel space of the two groups (i.e., the
Jamaican informants and Arab learners).
Following Eckman (1977), we expect our Jamaican infor-
mants and Arab learners to replace this vowel and complex
segment with the closest less marked segment in their vocalic
systems. Thus, because the first element (i.e., the schwa) is a
weak vowel, the substitution would be based on the second
element, which is a mid-high centralized rounded vowel
(i.e., //). To keep the mid position of this diphthong, the
centrality component has been removed and replaced by a
lowness component /a/, which is dependent on /u/ to yield
//, and once this is done, we assume that the phonetic articu-
latory content of this vowel is mapped onto the articulatory
content of the schwa. This operation would yield the vowel
/o:/. The dependency notations in Figure 3 illustrate these
substitutions.
It is noteworthy that a model of phonological description
such as the one with the dependency notations in Figure 3,
which allows componentiality, would allow the second lan-
guage researcher or the creolist in the area of phonology to
relate the speaker's pronunciation in these two situations to
general principles that constitute the principles of the model
used. For instance, the descriptions and explanations avail-
able through standard handbooks such as Mitchell and
El-Hassan (1989) handle the well-known phonological phe-
nomena in the pronunciation of Arab learners of English.
They outline the phonetic features of language in the native
language, comparing them with the characteristics of those
of the target language, and then hypothesizing about predic-
tions in the behavior of speakers. One consequence of this
practice is that one would have the impression that the mis-
pronunciations of vowels are unrelated phenomena, in spite
of the fact that obvious similarities in alternations in the
structural change of the target vowels follow from the same
principle. In other words, if we go about enumerating mis-
pronunciations and assigning different descriptive labels to
them, we would give the impression that we are dealing with
unrelated instantiations of behavior in pronunciation. When
we give a different name to a process, we tend to talk of this
process as a phenomenon different from the others. We wish
to argue that if we set off analyzing our learners' interlan-
guage and our Jamaicans' speech in terms of the acquisition
of parameters (in the descriptive sense), then we can easily
relate what would seem unrelated processes, and we would
thereby capture the phonologically significant generaliza-
tions about our learners' interphonological grammar and the
phonology of the JC. To the extent that this line of argument
is valid, we consider the lack of the centrality parameter in
our learners' vowel space and perhaps that of the JC as the
variable from which the mispronunciation of the above diph-
thongs emanates. The second principle that seems to explain
the mispronunciation of diphthongs is the process whereby
the schwa, which lacks locational information, is filled with
the articulatory content of the neighboring vowel together
with which it constitutes a diphthong. This insight is
expressed with a copy rule, which has been postulated above
and which will be repeated in Figure 4.
This rule reads as follows: Fill the articulatory gesture of
a vowel that lacks it with the locational information of the

vowel immediately preceding and following it, where  is a
variable ranging over loci. From this discussion of the behav-
ior of our Arab learners and our Jamaican informants as far
as the vowel space is concerned, it emerges that only two
principles can explain the fact that the above diphthongs and
central vowels have not been acquired fully yet. These two
principles are the centrality parameter and the copy rule.
Concerning the alternations /e/ ~ /e:/, the first element in
this diphthong is, more or less, the mid high vowel /e/, such
as the one in men, followed by a short transition into the
direction of the centralized vowel //. If this movement is
coupled with a slightly more open quality for the first ele-
ment, then the already lax vowel // is weakened. And
because our learners, and perhaps our informants, cannot be
informed by their linguistic backgrounds to retrieve this
diphthong, and once the first element is tense, the // becomes
very likely to take on the articulatory content of the preced-
ing vowel. One can claim that the laxness in // is perceived
as a schwa by our learners and Jamaican informants.
Evidence for this claim can be drawn from our learners' and
informants' pronunciation of the words bear, pear, share,
hair and where, prepare, and wear, respectively, in that all
these words are pronounced with [e:] (cf. tables 3 and 4).
On universal grounds, Wode (1980) notes that the open
rising diphthongs (/a/, /a/) and the falling (//) would
very unlikely be replaced by L1 forms in an L2 learning situ-
ation. Furthermore, Wode (1980) has found that L2 English
diphthongs /e/ and // are regularly replaced by the
monophthongs /e/ and /o/, respectively, by speakers with dif-
ferent L1 backgrounds. Wode's observation is based on
investigation of data provided by native speakers of Hindi,
French, Arabic, and Twi (cf. Wode, 1980, p. 133). James
(1989) takes this fact to be due to universal typological con-
straints to the effect that if a language contains closing diph-
thongs, the least marked and possibly the easiest to pronounce
forms will be those that are maximally open to close in their
articulation.
OurArab learners'and Jamaican informants'performance
with respect to the diphthongs /a/, /a/, and // lends sup-
port to James'assumption in that these three diphthongs have
not been found to pose learning problems for them. Support
for universal tendency of the monophthongization of these
two diphthongs comes from Hyman (1975). According to
Hyman,
Phonological rules can coalesce segments. In many languages /
a/ and /a/ are realized respectively as /e/ (or[]) and [o] or [].
In such cases the phonetic output is in a sense a "blend" of the
two segments in the phonological input: the lowness of /a/
combined with the close tongue position of /i/ and /u/ results in
the mid vowels [e] and [o]. (p. 14)
Our learners and Jamaican informants have produced the
long vowels (i.e., /e:/ and /o:/) because of the following con-
siderations. The test words we used in the experiments are
almost all monosyllabic, and the lengthening they produced
can be due either to the fact that a short vowel cannot stand
as a nucleus of a monosyllabic word with simple coda, or
that this behavior has been instigated by the postulation that
these diphthongs are universally more marked or less easy to
pronounce. Another obstacle for the learning of /e/ (espe-
cially in the case of ourArab learners) is that the first element
in the diphthong /e/ has not yet been acquired fully by our
learners (cf. Mousa, 1994). This implies that the acquisition
of diphthongs would have as a prerequisite the acquisition of
elements constituting those diphthongs. We can hypothesize
that at this stage, the only feature that has been acquired by
the two groups (i.e., Arab learners and Jamaican informants)
concerning the diphthongs // and /e/ is duration. And the
only diphthongs produced relatively correctly do not involve
the centrality component.
We also take it that the centrality component is a marked
parameter in the vowel space, compared with the lowness
and height parameters. To the extent that this stipulation is
correct, one would expect the centrality parameter to be set at
a stage succeeding the setting of the lowness and height
parameters. Indeed, English centering diphthongs are
acquired by Arabs at the final stage (Stage VII) in Mousa's
(1994) study, due to their difficulty. Following Eckman
(1977), we take it that typological markedness is a valid tech-
nique for measuring the degree of difficulty in acquiring a
second language, L1, and perhaps in the explanation of
behavior of pidgin and creole speakers because of the fol-
lowing considerations. Language universals are a reflection
of the structure of the human mind (Lenneberg, 1967).
Furthermore, it is assumed that human beings normally learn
to do things that are less complex before they learn to do
things that are more complex, but never the other way around
(Sanders, 1977).
Monophthongization of English diphthongs seems to be
resorted to for two different purposes. That is, speakers of
AAVE and the more general dialect of the Southern United
States (Burling, 1973; Labov, 2002), and perhaps speakers of
Atlantic creoles, as indicated by Schneider (1989), seem to
pronounce such words as pride, proud, and oil without or
with a reduced glide as a sign of identity preserving. "It is
possible that there is a kind of historical connection between
this and the parallel reduction of diphthongs in some Atlantic
creoles" (Holm, 2000, p. 148). In fact, Frank Gooding, the
phonetician in the Department of Language and Linguistics,
University College of North Wales at Bangor, noticed that
our Jamaican informants produced the words name and way
without any glide (i.e., with the monophthong [e:]), and the
word house with a diphthong that was not fully rounded (i.e.,
with [`]). However, off-gliding in the pronunciation of
English diphthongs by L2 learners is mainly resorted to due
to their markedness. For instance, in the pronunciation of /
/, L2 learners seem to be unaware of the fact that the dif-
ference between the two elements of the diphthongs is insig-
nificant, although the second element is produced with little
Mousa 9
increase of lip protrusion. What they seem to be doing is start
the glide with a truly back vowel (Gimson, 1980), as men-
tioned earlier. Once the schwa is absent from the vocalic sys-
tem of our learners, its position is filled with articulatory
function of the back vowel, which has been substituted for
the second element of //, hence conveying [o:]. In other
words, the use of [o:] "shows the horizontal feature specifi-
cation [back], as opposed to the TL specification of the initial
element of // as [central]" (James, 1987, p. 242). Hung
(2004) reports the following Diphthong Reduction Rule in
the interlanguage phonology of the speakers of Hong Kong
English:
Rule 1: VVV/-- / [+ stop (+back) or + nasal].
According to this rule, a diphthong is reduced to a monoph-
thong when followed by a velar stop or a nasal, as displayed
in the following Hong Kong English examples:
lake  [lk]
take  [tk]
joke  [k]
soak  [sk]
pain  [p]
rain  [r]
loan  [l]
bone  [b].
Other examples of monophthongization are also mani-
fested by Randell (2004), regarding Finglish3 speakers. The
words stove, grocery, and birthday are pronounced as touvi,
rosseri, and pörtteri, respectively. Notice that there is no
indication of a glide, whatsoever. Thus, so far, creole speak-
ers, speakers of AAVE, and English L2 learners are all con-
sistent with the above monophthongization of English
diphthongs. In what follows, an account of the child's behav-
ior in this connection is given, thus echoing Ervin-Tripp
(1974) and others'inquiry whether second language learning
is like L1.
The same phenomenon of monophthongization of diph-
thongs has been found to shape child language in general.
Children from different linguistic backgrounds tend to sim-
plify diphthongs by reducing them into a simple vowel.
According to Hua and Dodd (2000), who investigated the
acquisition of Modern Standard Chinese, the vowel retained
was normally the louder and more sonorant vowel of the
diphthong. Thus, the children tended to produce the second
element of on-gliding diphthongs, for example, /ua/ as //,
but the first element of off-gliding diphthongs, for example,
/ao/ was produced as [a]. They also came to the conclusion
that whereas simple vowels emerged early in development,
triphthongs and diphthongs were prone to systematic errors.
In acquiring Brazilian Portuguese, according to Santos
(2007), children apply elision where adults apply diphthon-
gization. Consider table 5 which illustrates examples from
Santos (2007).
Notice that the child's productions do not contain glides
(cf. table 5). In other words, what is pronounced as a diph-
thong by adults is realized as a monophthong by children.
Santos refers this to the fact that children use elision instead
of diphthongization before they acquire the syllable structure
CCV, which allows parsing of raising diphthongs such as
those in the examples above. Moreover, the examples above
point to the fact that these children have not yet mastered the
acquisition of Sandhi processing, which Santos thinks needs
to be learnt (see Lass, 1984).
Monophthongization of diphthongs appears to shape the
early stages of child phonology in many investigations, and
the diphthongs //and /e/ have been reported to be among
the most problematic diphthongs in both L1 and L2 learning.
Table 5 provides a brief illustration of child's substitutions
for diphthongs is given.
Notice that all the child's renditions of the English diph-
thongs displayed in Table 6--except the last three--are
monophthongs. This monophthongization seems to be a pop-
ular strategy in dealing with diphthongs, especially those that
contain problematic elements. For instance, in the acquisition
of Finnish vowel harmony (FVH), Leiwo, Kulju, and Moyama
(2006) report that all the productions of children of 2.6 years,

when confronting front vowels especially the diphthongs
/yö:/ and /öy/ as in "pyöra," bike, and "pöyta," table, include
substitutions of long vowels for the diphthongs in question.
The reason is that these diphthongs contain front rounded
vowels, which are yet to be acquired. Consequently, these
diphthongs have always been replaced by back monoph-
thongs. Likewise, some vowels appear later than others in
English L1 learning. According to Bernhardt and Stemberger
(1998), among English vowels, the basic triangle (/i/, /a/, and
/u/) is mastered first, followed by back and central vowels.
They add that the front non-low vowels (i.e., /e/, //, //) and
r-colored vowels (//, //) are reported to be the last vowels to
be acquired by an English-speaking child. Thus, the child's
renditions of English diphthongs as monophthongs (cf. Table
6) can be explained in terms of the markedness of their ele-
ments. In other words, the English diphthongs /e/ and //
consist of sounds that are acquired late in child language. The
Finnish children's behavior with respect to the pronunciation
of these two diphthongs lends support to Zajdo's (2002) find-
ings that Hungarian speaking children have problems with
front rounded vowels at ages 2.0 and 2.6.
Further struggle with diphthongs containing the centrality
parameter is reported by Kehoe and Lleo (2003). With refer-
ence to Kehoe and Lleo (2003), at Stage I, when he was
1:6.16 (1 year, 6 months, and 16 days old) and 1:7.1 (1 year,
7 months, and 1 day old), Thomas--who was learning
German--produced heij /has/ as [has] (meaning hot) and
moin /mn/ as [mn] (meaning good morning). The analy-
sis of diphthongs produced by Thomas at Time Periods II
and III indicated that diphthongs were produced more accu-
rately than even long vowels. This may be taken as a cor-
roboration of Olmsted's (1971) survey. The survey suggests
that full mastery of vowels--including diphthongs--will not
be achieved until the age of 4.
However, the above substitutions of diphthongs with
long vowels do not downplay the fact that children are capa-
ble of producing complex vowels that are sometimes taken
to approximate the adult targets. For instance, in addition to
target-like productions ([ptæ] and [pyræ]), children's
productions with FVH only in Leiwo et al.'s (2006) total
data included forms such as [pæijæ], [pipæ], [pætæ], and
[p:tæ] for [pöytä], and [pø:py], [py:py], [pijæ], and
[p:ræ] for pyörä (Leiwo et al., 2006). Notice that all these
productions contain diphthongs, though not the targets. This
would give the impression that diphthongs are acquired
gradually. Further evidence for the gradual acquisition of
diphthongs comes from Garo and the English-speaking
child in Burling (1978) who has been reported to make the
last three substitutions in Table 6. That is, the two elements
of the diphthong are pronounced but without the fusing of
the English nucleus whose second element is a centralized
vowel. We take the child's response with two vowels instead
of a monophthong as a sign of progress toward the target
diphthongs. We also suggest that diphthongs--including /
e/ and //--will not be acquired authentically until their
elements have been fully mastered. Bond, Petrosino, and
Dean (1982) traced child vowel development after the
period of 17 to 29 months. They noticed a clear overlap
between the vowels and imprecisely defined vowel space,
which suggested inaccurate articulatory gestures during
Linguistic Stages I and II. In other words, the vowels of
these early stages showed less definition in the F2 dimen-
sion than later productions of the same vowel tokens. Their
observation revealed that the F1 range of early vowels was
extensive and that later productions had considerably less
variability in the F1 plane. Consider Figure 5.
Notice the clear overlap of the vowels displayed. Perhaps
this explains Fletcher's (1973) claim that the lips, tongue,
and palate of the new born allow only gross phonation; 6 to
8 more years of development are necessary for the develop-
ment of coordinated articulatory pattern. This is a clear indi-
cation of physiological limitations in the child.
Adults' failure to produce English diphthongs, which
involve centrality parameter, can also be ascribed to the fact
that members of such diphthongs are yet to be produced
authentically. For instance, according to Bohn and Flege
(1992) and Major (1987), Germans and speakers of Brazilian
Portuguese produced an accented // in a word such as "bet,"
that was relatively higher in the acoustic vowel space and
short in duration. Germans also produced English /i/ and //
higher in the acoustic vowel space than speakers of English
(Bohn & Flege, 1992).
In Busà (1992), native speakers of Italian have been
reported to produce an undistinguished vowel for both /u/
and // in food and foot, which is about as high as anAmerican
/u/ as indicated by similar first formant frequency values,
though less centralized. It is more back and more rounded, as
displayed by the low F2 values. Even in terms of perception,
it is thought that acoustic vowel space indicators of tongue

height and advancement during vowel articulation are cru-
cial for the identification of vowel (Fox, 1982). To explain
how such a link might manifest itself, Repp (in Fox, 1982)
and Oden and Massaro (in Fox, 1982) refer to a prototype
model of speech perception. In other words, the ideal inter-
nalized perceptual prototype of a particular vowel, which is
defined in terms of features pertaining to important acoustic
cues of the vowel in question, may be identical to the ideal-
ized acoustic/articulatory target at which a speaker aims dur-
ing the manipulation of that vowel. This might explain the
behavior of Saudi learners of English in Mousa (1994). The
learners produced the vowels /e/ as [i], // as [i], and // as
[u]. The results of perception and production tests showed
that this was more or less exactly how they perceived these
vowels. This reminds us of the phonological processes of the
tensing of lax vowel and the merger of /// before nasals in
AAVE. According to Bailey and Thomas (1998) and Labov
(1972), among others, speakers of this variety of English
pronounce still, pig, pen, and again, as [stil], [pig], [pn],
and [gin], respectively. One should not be surprised to come
across this development. According to Hall (1966),
In the earlier stages of English-based pidgins, the distinction
between tense and lax vowels often disappeared, and there was
no longer a contrast between the /i/ vowel of English beat and
the // vowel of bit; between /u/ in fluke and // in book; between
/e/ in bait and / / in bet; or between // as in coat and // as in
caught. (p. 29)
The above behavior on the part of adults is expected to
have been instigated by the influence of an earlier linguistic
system (L1 in the case of Italian, German, and Arabic speak-
ers, and substrate systems in the case of African American
speakers).
This being the case, one would like to argue that once
non-native speakers of English find difficulty producing sin-
gle vowels, especially centralized ones, then it would be
more difficult for them to produce diphthongs containing
them. Indeed, diphthongs involving centrality parameters are
reported to be most problematic for learners from different
linguistic backgrounds (Wode, 1980). Moreover, the learn-
ing of these diphthongs is expected to take place in stages.
Consider table 7 which illustrates the gradual acquisition of
the diphthong /e/ in against reported in Mousa (1994) and
which is written in the form of phonological rules. All these
stages were observed in the speech of Arab learners of
English.
Notice that Rules 3, 4, and 5 as is the case in table 7 are
intrinsically ordered: 3. e  e:, 4. e:  e, and 5. e  i.
Thus, before our learners manage to produce the target
diphthong, their productions manifest variation, which may
indicate the developmental aspect of their learning. This
would make one conclude that in both L1 and L2, the acqui-
sition of diphthongs, especially ones that involve centrality
parameter, is accomplished gradually. As for our Jamaican
informants, we can also find evidence in favor of the gradual
production of diphthongs. According to phonetician Frank
Gooding, one of our informants pronounced the words name
and way with the vowel /e/, short of /e:/, which has been used
abundantly by both informants for the diphthong /e/.
Gooding also suggests that in their pronunciation of the
words house and out, the first vowel of the diphthong is not
fully rounded. He suggests that their pronunciation would
best be transcribed as [h`s] and [`t] rather than RP /has/
and /at/. Also, in the pronunciation of weir and wear, our
informants manifested the following variation. Although
they both pronounced both diphthongs as [e:] most of the
time, they also pronounced both words with a vowel such as
that found in the French words "soeur," sister, "fleur," flower,
and so on, that is, [oe]. In addition, the barber also pronounced
wear as [wi:r] and prepare as [pripi:r]. Regarding the internal
structure of the diphthongs in question, we mentioned earlier
that centralized vowels are not part of Jamaican vocalic
inventory. However, one might argue that the mid vowel /e/,
which constitutes the first element in /e/ and /e/, is a legiti-
mate vowel in JC; therefore, these diphthongs should be
easier to pronounce by our informants. The answer is that
their pronunciation of "correct," "television," "seven," and
so on as [korik], [tilivin], [sivin], respectively, suggests
that /e/ and /i/ are merged, perhaps indicating that their
behavior resembles that of speakers of AAVE.
In a similar vein, one can also assume that our Jamaicans'
pronunciation of the diphthongs /e/ and // is influenced
by the AAVE. In this variety of English, the second element
of the diphthong /a/ is deleted, and the first element is typi-
cally lengthened. Thus, words such as pie, ride, and time are
pronounced as [p:], [r:d] and [t:m], respectively (Bailey
& Thomas, 1998; Rickford, 1999; Wolfram, 1994). The same
applies to words such as toybox [tbaks] instead of /tbaks/,
oil [] instead of [l], and cowboy [kabo] instead of
[kab] (Rickford, 1999; Wolfram, 1994). Moreover, words
such as cake and coats are pronounced with monophthongs,
for example, [kek] and [kot], respectively (Bailey & Thomas,
1998). They report that this last behavior is witnessed in
Gullah and Carribean creoles, and that in the 1800s, it
occurred in AAVE.
The history of English has revealed that with the excep-
tion of //, the RP diphthongs often derive from earlier pure
vowels (Gimson, 1980). The most significant sound change

of the Middle English was the Great Vowel Shift. What hap-
pened was that non-low long vowels raised one height and
high vowels diphthongized, as illustrated by Figure 6.
Notice that the diphthongs // and /e/ were once pro-
nounced as [o:] and [e:], respectively. Another fact regarding
the development of diphthongs from single vowels comes
from the Romance languages. It is common for stressed and
unstressed syllables to behave differently with the evolve-
ment of language. For instance, in the Romance languages,
the Latin vowels /e/ and /o/ have generally diphthongized in
a stressed syllable. Because stress figures in verb conjuga-
tion, this has resulted in verbs with vowel alternation in these
languages. By way of illustration, the Spanish verb "volver"
(to turn) has the form "volvi" in the past but "vuelvo" in the
present. In Italian, the same phenomenon is observed, but
with the vowel /o/ alternating with /uo/, instead. Nouns also
do bear this fact. For example, Spanish "ventilación" (venti-
lation) becomes "viento" (wind) from Latin "ventum"
(Wikipedia). In fact, today, many varieties from RP in the
London area and many other regions use pure long vowels
varying between cardinal [o:] and cardinal [] for //, and
cardinal [e:] and cardinal [:] for /e/ (Gimson, 1980). One
form of the development of these two diphthongs is that the
pure vowels [:] and [:] had probably reached a quality near
cardinal [o:] and cardinal [e:] in the 16th and 17th centuries
(cf. Gimson, 1980, for a fuller account). The above historical
facts about the diphthongs in question are crucial for explain-
ing the behavior of our Jamaican informants regarding the
production of these sounds. That is, Holm (2000) was quite
right to suggest that
in any discussion of the development of European vowels into
their corresponding forms in the creoles, it should be recalled
that the starting point was not necessarily the same as the modern
vowel of the standard European language, but rather the
corresponding vowel of the speech of the 15th to 17th centuries
(for Portuguese and Spanish) or 17th to 18th centuries (for
French, Dutch, and English). (p. 146)
Thus, one can safely assume that Jamaican informants
might have retained the old pronunciation (or archaic usage)
of these diphthongs, as this is a common practice among cre-
ole speakers, regarding different aspects of language. For
instance, speakers of English-based Atlantic creoles use from
as a conjunction with the temporal meaning of since, for
example, "From I was a child I do that," which is part of both
archaic and regional English (Holm, 2000, p. 109). In Haitian
creolized French, chat /sat/ (earlier pronunciation) of cat is
used instead of today's /sa/. A third example comes from
Annobonese creolized Portuguese. In this creole, the word
for doctor is "babélu" from Portuguese "barbeiro" (barber).
This is because, in the past, barbers bled their clients
(patients) for treatment (cf. Holm, 2000).
Monophthongization of European diphthongs seems to
have always been the trend in the early creoles. Holm (2000)
cites the following examples from Sáo Tomé creolized
Portuguese. In this creole, the Portuguese diphthongs /ai/ and
/oi/ are pronounced as /a/ and /o/, as in "basu," under, from
Portuguese "debaixo" and "dodo," crazy, from (doido),
respectively. Hall (1966) refers this monophthongization to
the influence of substratum languages on the phonetics of
these creoles. According to Hall, many languages--includ-
ing those of Africa, China, and Melenesia--do not diphthon-
gize the vowels /i', e', , ,/ in such words as fear, go, bait,
and so on. Thus, neo-Melanesian, neo-Solomonic, and other
English-based pidgins and creoles normally have non-diph-
thongized vowels.
After this detailed account on the production of diph-
thongs, especially /e/ and //, in the contexts of L1, L2,
AAVE, historical linguistics, and creole languages, one clear
pattern is observed. That is, speakers in all these contexts
(including native speakers of English) indicate preference
for monophthongization. This is the case not only for those
whose languages do not have the diphthongs concerned but
also for adult native speakers. One explanation for this ten-
dency of monophthongization is that monophthongs require
less gymnastics to produce than diphthongs. In other words,
although the vowel substitution patterns of diphthongs are
more or less similar to those of long monophthongs, and
although both contain two timing units, diphthongs are more
complex than long vowels. Put differently, diphthongs con-
tain two separate root nodes, whereas long vowels contain
only one (Fikkert, 1994), as illustrated in Figure 7.
Notice that the second node of the diphthong is a glide
that is necessary for the speech organ to combine the vocalic
elements of the diphthong, and whose absence causes hin-
drance in the production of the diphthong. The glide will
also pave for the existence of the copy rule in Figures 3 and
4. It seems that this gymnastics, which involves the joining
of two vocalic elements, is not part of the vocalic system of
the speakers, so far. Thus, the natural consequence of this
marked gymnastics is to simplify the task by eliminating
the problematic gesture in the manipulation--the glide. Our
view on the complexity of diphthongs has been supported
by Stokes, Lau, and Ciocca (2000) regarding the production

of diphthongs by Cantonese-speaking children with phono-
logical disorders. They propose that diphthong errors arise
as a function of both ambient frequency and feature
complexity.
Conclusion
The output of this investigation is that to explain why L2
learners behave in a certain way, it is wise to look at other
modes of language contact, such as creole languages.
However, once the two fields (i.e., L2 and creole) involve
language in the making, in that they are linguistic systems
comprising finite numbers of grammatical rules (like any
natural language) capable of being internalized and used pro-
ductively by their speakers, it is inevitable to bring in the
domain of child language in which an attempt is made to
discover the logical problem of language learning. Our
investigation has shown that the learning of the diphthongs
under study is more or less accomplished in the same way in
the three domains. For instance, speakers in the three situa-
tions are found to simplify the two diphthongs by reducing
them into a simple vowel, thus eliminating the glide that
seems to be a problematic gesture in the manipulation of a
diphthong. In particular, the behaviour of the two groups
(i.e.,Arab learners of English and speakers of JC) with regard
to the acquisition of the two diphthongs in question corrobo-
rates that of child language, which is taken to be "external
evidence" in the sense of Singh (1988). The centrality param-
eter is found to be a marked feature in these diphthongs,
which need to be mastered before their production is han-
dled. Moreover, insights from historical linguistics suggest
that the strategies deployed by the child acquiring mother
tongue, L2 learners, and creole speakers are not incompatible
with the norms displayed in the development of natural lan-
guages. More specifically, Baron (1973) and Traugott (1977)
found a number of similarities between the historical change
and the line of change in language acquisition. Dickenson
(1976) also draws this parallel. Nemser (1981) postulates
that "the diachronic mechanism underlying historical change
and those active in . . . language acquisition are not only
closely related but also organically united" (p. 74). In a word,
it seems that the same factors govern the acquisition of these
two diphthongs in pidgin and creole languages, as well as in
second language learning.

Notes
1. Wells (1982) suggests that the opening diphthongs /ie/ and /uo/
can be applied in such words as "face" and "goat," to function
as social or allophoniac variants of the monophthongs.
2. Alleyne (1980) assumes that the above on-glide development
of this monophthong is a positive marker of decreolization.
3. Finglish is a variety of English spoken by immigrants of
Finnish origin in the United States and Canada.
