Higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associ-
ated with increased mortality and the development
of chronic disease. A recent study reported that all-
cause mortality increased 11% for every increase of 1.0 ×
109/L in leukocyte count above 3.5 × 109/L.1 Other studies
also reported a significant relation between mortality and
markers of inflammation.2 A higher leukocyte count, C-
reactive protein level and mean platelet volume predict the
development of cardiovascular disease and cancer.3­5
Despite the importance of low-grade inflammation in the
pathogenesis of chronic disease, factors influencing inflam-
mation in apparently healthy individuals are not well delin-
eated. In vitro data suggest that extracellular pH may modu-
late inflammation. Trevani and colleagues reported that
neutrophils were less active at a pH of 7.4 than at a lower pH.6
Lower extracellular pH also appeared to increase neutrophil
production and delay neutrophil apoptosis. Additional studies
have shown that lower extracellular pH activates other com-
ponents of the immune system, including other immune cells7
and the complement system.8
Existing studies linking acidosis to inflammation have
generally examined the impact of acute large reductions in
extracellular pH. However, chronic small reductions in pH
affect a variety of physiologic processes and may have a sub-
stantial impact on inflammation and the development of
chronic disease.9 For example, we previously reported that
small increases in serum anion gap and small decreases in
bicarbonate levels in healthy individuals whose acid­base
parameters were within normal limits were associated with
elevated blood pressure and increased insulin resistance,10,11
independent of body size and kidney function.
We conducted a population-based study of the relation
between serum acid­base status and inflammation. We exam-
ined the association between serum anion gap and serum lev-
els of bicarbonate and inflammatory biomarkers in healthy
individuals who participated in the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey during 1999­2006.
Methods
Study population
We obtained data for individuals who participated in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1999/
2000, 2001/02, 2003/04 or 2005/06. The design of the survey
has been described previously.12 In brief, the survey provides
nationally representative cross-sectional data on the health sta-
tus of the general population of the United States. Participants

Background: In vitro data suggest that lower extracellular
pH activates the immune system. We conducted a popula-
tion-based study of the relation between serum acid­base
status and inflammation.
Methods: We examined the serum anion gap and serum
levels of bicarbonate and inflammatory biomarkers in
4525 healthy adults who participated in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999­
2006. We excluded participants who had chronic disease,
recent infection and an estimated glomerular filtration
rate of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.
Results: The mean values of serum anion gap, bicarbonate
level, leukocyte count and C-reactive protein level were all
within normal limits. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnic
background, body mass index, serum albumin level and
other factors, we found that a higher anion gap and lower
bicarbonate level were associated with a higher leukocyte
count and higher C-reactive protein level. Compared with
participants in the lowest quartile of anion gap, those in
the highest quartile had a leukocyte count that was 1.0 ×
109/L higher and a C-reactive protein level that was
10.9 nmol/L higher (p < 0.01). Compared with participants
in the highest quartile of bicarbonate level, those in the
lowest quartile had a leukocyte count that was 0.7 × 109/L
higher and a C-reactive protein level that was 4.0 nmol/L
higher (p  0.02). A higher anion gap and lower bicarbon-
ate level were also associated with a higher platelet count,
a larger mean platelet volume and a higher ferritin level.
Interpretation: A higher serum anion gap and lower bicar-
bonate level were associated with higher levels of inflam-
matory biomarkers in a healthy sample of the general pop-
ulation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relation
between acid­base status and inflammation.

were interviewed and underwent physical examination. Partic-
ipants over the age of 12 years who did not have hemophilia or
undergo recent cancer chemotherapy were eligible for
venipuncture.
For our analysis, we excluded participants who had acute
or chronic diseases that could potentially affect their serum
acid­base status and inflammatory biomarker levels. From an
initial cohort of 22 624 participants aged 18 years or more,
we excluded 12 877 who had self-reported chronic disease,
including arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic
kidney disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery dis-
ease, myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular disease,
liver disease and cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer).
We also excluded 1144 participants who were taking oral
hypoglycemic therapy, insulin, antihypertensive therapy,
diuretics, cholesterol-lowering medications, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs or acetylsalicylic acid; 1983 participants
who reported having an infection within the month before the
survey; 301 participants who reported donating blood within
the year before the survey; 935 participants without dietary
information; and 507 participants without laboratory informa-
tion. We excluded an additional 309 participants who had an
albumin level of less than 35 g/L, a calcium level of more
than 2.6 mmol/L or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of
less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Finally, to eliminate out-
liers, we excluded 43 participants who had extreme values for
serum anion gap. We included the remaining 4525 partici-
pants in our analysis.
Measurement of laboratory parameters
Serum levels of electrolytes, albumin and creatinine were
measured with the use of a Hitachi Model 704 multichannel
analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
USA) and the Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter
Inc., Fullerton, USA). We calculated the anion gap according
to the following equation: anion gap (mmol/L) = serum
sodium level (mmol/L) ­ [serum chloride level (mmol/L) +
serum bicarbonate level (mmol/L)].
Leukocyte counts, platelet counts and mean platelet vol-
ume were measured with the use of a Beckman Coulter
MAXM Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). C-reactive protein
levels were measured with the use of a Dad Behring Nephelo-
meter II Analyzer System (Dad Behring Diagnostics Inc.,
Somerville, USA). Serum ferritin levels were measured with
the use of the Quantimune Ferritin IRMA kit (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories, Hercules, USA). Fibrinogen levels were measured by
means of the Clauss clotting method on the STA-Compact
analyzer (Diagnostica Stago S.A., Asnieres, France). Serum
ferritin and fibrinogen levels were not available for individu-
als who participated in the 2003/04 and 2005/06 surveys.
We calculated the glomerular filtration rate according to
the simplified prediction equation in the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease Study (MDRD).13 We corrected serum crea-
tinine levels for participants in the 1999/2000 and 2005/06
surveys to align creatinine values with the creatinine assay
used in the development of the MDRD equation.14,15 Serum
creatinine levels for participants in the 2001/02 and 2003/04
surveys did not require correction.
Statistical analysis
Because older individuals, Hispanic and black individuals
were intentionally overrepresented in the survey populations,
we applied appropriate sample weights to obtain weighted
regression estimates. The final results of our analyses are gen-
eralizable to the US population.
We divided values for serum anion gap into quartiles.
Within each quartile, we calculated the percentage of each cate-
gorical demographic characteristic and the mean (and standard
error) of age, body mass index (BMI) and each laboratory mea-
surement. Ethnic background was predefined in the surveys as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or other. In
linear regression analyses, we included leukocyte count, neu-
trophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophil
count, basophil count, C-reactive protein level, platelet count,
mean platelet volume, ferritin level and fibrinogen level as
dependent variables, with quartiles of serum anion gap (or con-
tinuous anion gap) as the independent variable. We considered
the following covariates: age, sex, ethnic background, use of
alcohol, BMI, dietary protein intake, and serum levels of creati-
nine, albumin, urea, uric acid and cotinine. We calculated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for parameter estimates of the depen-
dent variables. We calculated tests of trend across quartiles of
anion gap values, with the median value of each quartile serv-
ing as an ordinal variable. All p values were 2-sided. We per-
formed similar analyses with serum bicarbonate level, rather
than anion gap, as the independent variable.
Protocols to recruit and examine participants of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were
reviewed and approved by the US National Center for Health
Statistics Institutional Review Board.
Results
The following mean values were all within normal limits: serum
anion gap 11.6 mmol/L, bicarbonate level 24.2 mmol/L, leuko-
cyte count 7.2 × 109/L, C-reactive protein level 26.0 nmol/L,
platelet count 271.6 × 109/L, mean platelet volume 8.2 fL, ferritin
level 261.7 pmol/L and fibrinogen level 10.1 mol/L. Character-
istics of the 4525 participants included in our study, by quartile
of serum anion gap, are shown in Table 1. The different numbers
of participants in each quartile were a result of the high fre-
quency of shared anion gap levels in our population. Because the
associations between serum anion gap and biomarkers of inflam-
mation and between serum bicarbonate level and biomarkers of
inflammation did not vary by sex or race, we combined results
for men and women and for different ethnic groups.
Serum anion gap was positively associated with leukocyte
count and C-reactive protein level (Table 2). After multivari-
able adjustment (for age, sex, BMI, ethnic background, use of
alcohol, dietary protein intake, and serum levels of creatinine,
albumin, urea, uric acid and cotinine), we found that the leuko-
cyte count increased by 1.5 (95% CI 1.2­1.9) × 109/L and the
C-reactive protein level by 1.8 (95% CI 1.2­2.5) nmol/L for
every increase of 1 mmol/L in anion gap. The R2 for the multi-
variable-adjusted models was 0.15 for the leukocyte count and
0.21 for the C-reactive protein level. After multivariable adjust-
ment, participants in the highest quartile of anion gap, com-

pared with those in the lowest quartile, had a leukocyte count
that was 1.0 × 109/L higher (p for trend < 0.01) and a C-reactive
protein level 10.9 nmol/L higher (p for trend < 0.01).
Serum anion gap was also positively associated with plate-
let count, mean platelet volume and ferritin level. After multi-
variable adjustment, participants in the highest quartile of
anion gap, compared with those in the lowest quartile, had a
platelet count that was 12.5 × 109/L higher (p for trend < 0.01),
a mean platelet volume 0.2 fL higher (p for trend < 0.01) and a
ferritin level 8.9 pmol/L higher (p for trend = 0.05).
We found an inverse relation between serum bicarbonate
level and inflammatory biomarkers. After multivariable adjust-
ment, the leukocyte count increased by 0.1 (95% CI 0.06­0.2) ×
109/L and the C-reactive protein level by 0.6 (95% CI 0.0­1.1)
nmol/L for every decrease of 1 mmol/L in serum bicarbonate
level. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the lowest
quartile of serum bicarbonate level, compared with those in the
highest quartile, had a leukocyte count that was 0.7 × 109/L
higher (p for trend < 0.01) and a C-reactive protein level that
was 4.0 nmol/L higher (p for trend = 0.02) (Table 3).
Serum bicarbonate level was also inversely associated
with platelet count, mean platelet volume and ferritin level.
After multivariable adjustment, participants in the lowest
quartile of serum bicarbonate level, compared with those in
the highest quartile, had a platelet count that was 12.5 × 109/L
higher (p for trend < 0.01), a mean platelet volume that was
0.2 fL higher (p for trend = 0.02) and a ferritin level that was
49.9 pmol/L higher (p for trend < 0.01).
After multivariable adjustment, both a higher serum anion
gap and a lower serum bicarbonate level were associated with
higher neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts (p < 0.01).
Only a higher anion gap was also associated with a higher

were not associated with eosinophil count or fibrinogen level.
The results did not change significantly after further
adjustment of multivariable models for serum levels of cal-
cium, potassium and insulin, and dietary potassium intake.
Interpretation
Among healthy adults who participated in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999­2006, we
found that a higher anion gap and a lower serum bicarbonate
level were associated with higher levels of several inflamma-
tory biomarkers, including leukocyte count and C-reactive
protein level. These relations were independent of age, sex,
BMI, ethnic background, use of alcohol, dietary protein intake,
and serum levels of creatinine, cotinine, albumin, uric acid and
urea. Because we excluded participants who had chronic dis-
eases, those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less
than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and those who were taking a vari-
ety of medications, it is unlikely that illness or a reduced
glomerular filtration rate accounted for the associations with
inflammatory biomarkers. Of note, the mean values of serum
electrolytes, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, platelet
count, mean platelet volume, ferritin level and fibrinogen level
in our study population were all within normal limits.
The cause of the observed association between higher
serum anion gap and higher levels of inflammatory biomark-
ers in this apparently healthy population is unknown. Eleva-
tions in the serum anion gap can result from an increase in
unmeasured anions, as occurs in several forms of metabolic
acidosis, or from a decrease in unmeasured cations.16 In gen-
eral, reductions in serum calcium and potassium concentra-
tions are an unusual cause of an increased anion gap.16 In our
study, the relation between anion gap and inflammation was
unchanged after adjustment for these cations. Serum albumin
can also affect the anion gap;17 however, we excluded individ-
uals with low serum albumin levels and adjusted for albumin
in the multivariable analyses. A mild increase in anion gap
has been reported in metabolic alkalosis;18 however, we are
unaware of data linking metabolic alkalosis to inflammation.
In our study, higher serum bicarbonate levels were not associ-
ated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers.

Research
The participants in our study who had a higher anion gap
may have had a circulating unmeasured anion that contributed
to a greater level of inflammation. The inverse relation be-
tween serum bicarbonate and inflammatory biomarkers sug-
gests that such an anion, if present, may be the conjugate base
of an organic acid. In vitro data suggest that lower extracellu-
lar pH stimulates the inflammatory response. Lower extracel-
lular pH results in lower intracellular pH in neutrophils,6
which may activate neutrophils.19 Furthermore, lower extra-
cellular pH may activate the complement system.8
The small increases in levels of inflammatory biomarkers
associated with increasing anion gap in our study were similar
in size to the changes observed in other studies linking inflam-
mation to the development of various chronic diseases. For
each increase of 1.0 × 109/L in leukocyte count, the risk of car-
diovascular events among postmenopausal women has been
found to increase by 11%3 and the risk of death from any
cause in the general population has been found to increase by
11%.1 Similar findings have been reported for death secondary
to coronary artery disease,20 cerebrovascular disease21 and can-
cer.22 Several studies have shown that the risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease increases significantly with increasing levels of C-
reactive protein.23 Erlinger and colleagues found that an
increase of 1.02 mg/L (9.7 nmol/L) in C-reactive protein level
increased the risk of colorectal cancer by 43%.4
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, because the data were cross-
sectional, we were unable to determine whether higher serum
anion gap or lower serum bicarbonate level were risk factors
for, rather than the result of, inflammation. Thus, our observa-
tional data are hypothesis generating. Second, unknown factors
may have affected both the serum acid­base status and the
inflammatory biomarker levels in our study participants. Our
multivariable regression models accounted for only 15%­21%
of the variation in leukocyte count and C-reactive protein level.
Third, the study participants did not eat controlled diets. How-
ever, the primary dietary determinants of net endogenous acid
production are total protein and potassium.9 Adjustment for the
intake of these factors did not change our results. Finally, we
did not have measurements of arterial pH or partial pressure of
carbon dioxide, nor did we have urinary parameters to measure
renal net acid excretion. Thus, we are unable to assess fully the
acid­base status of the participants in the study.
Conclusion
A higher serum anion gap and a lower serum bicarbonate level,
despite being within normal limits, were independently associ-
ated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers in a healthy
sample of the general population. These data raise the possibil-
ity that increased production of organic acid mediates the
chronic inflammatory state that increases the risk of coronary
artery disease and cancer. Further studies are needed to deter-
mine the effect of alkali supplementation on inflammatory bio-
marker levels and to examine prospectively the relation
between acid­base status, inflammation and chronic disease.
