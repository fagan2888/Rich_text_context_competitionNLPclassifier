A population-based sample (N = 787) was followed for 8 years and assessed three times on measures of well-being
(depressive symptoms, morale, and control) and fall history. Marginal models assessed the association between
baseline well-being measures and falling. Random effects models assessed change in well-being indicators as well
as change in fall rate over 8 years. After adjustment for sociodemographics, psychotropic medication, health, and
sensorimotor function, our results showed that depressive symptoms, control, and morale were risk factors for
subsequent falling, and an increase in depressive symptoms or a reduction in morale was associated with an
increasing fall rate. We conclude that the three well-being measures are independently associated with falling and
need to be considered in fall-risk assessments and population-based prevention and intervention strategies.
Key Words: Falls--Well-being--Depression--Morale.
FALLS constitute a major public health problem in later life
and are the leading cause of unintentional injury and
hospitalization in persons aged 65 and older (Dellinger &
Stevens, 2006). With age, the risk of falling rises steadily, and
the 12-month risk of mortality after being hospitalized for a fall
is approximately 50% (Rubenstein, 2006). Considerable re-
search has identified risk factors for falling, and evaluation of
interventions to address these risk factors is extensive. Most of
this research has focused on understanding the physiological,
sensory, and environmental factors leading to falls (Lord,
Clark, & Webster, 1991; Lord & Fitzpatrick, 2001; Lord et al.,
2003; Lord, Ward, Williams, & Anstey, 1993, 1994). There is
also literature demonstrating that depressive symptoms may
increase the risk of falling in later life for both community-
based individuals (Kron, Loy, Sturm, Nikolaus, & Becker,
2003) and stroke survivors (Jorgensen, Engstad, & Jacobsen,
2002). The Osteoporotic Fractures Study found that, over a
6-year follow-up period, depression increased the risk of falling
by 60% in women aged 65 and older (Whooley et al., 1999).
Another multisite study of 311 community-dwelling elders
followed for 36 weeks found that ``depressive state of mind''
predicted falling along with more traditional risk factors such as
sway, fall history, and grip strength (Stalenhoef, Diederiks,
Knottnerus, Kester, & Crebolder, 2002).
It remains unclear whether the association between depression
and falling is a direct effect or whether it is mediated by psy-
chotropic medication (Cumming, 1998; Leipzig, Cumming, &
Tinetti, 1999; Lord, Anstey, Williams, & Ward, 1995), cognitive
decline (Anstey, von Sanden, & Luszcz, 2006), physical decline
(Penninx et al., 1998), or other factors. One study has shown that
depression among hospitalized older adults is associated with
motor disturbances that may predispose individuals to falling,
thus providing one mechanistic link between depression and
falling (Turcu et al., 2004). In the present study we seek to
broaden the scope of factors that are considered to be potential
predictors of falling in later life, by examining psychological
well-being as a predictor and covariate of falling, in the
Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing.
It is possible that the observed associations between
depressive symptoms and falling reflect a more general
association between psychological well-being (Luszcz, 1998)
and falling, justifying the investigation of other measures of
psychological well-being for potential inclusion in fall-risk
assessments or for incorporation in intervention strategies. The
relationship between well-being and adaptive aging has
received increasing attention (Ryff & Singer, 2000) as the
literature recognizes that well-being is more than the absence of
mental illness or negative affective states. Two approaches to
well-being have been identified (Ryan & Deci, 2001). The
hedonic approach focuses on the experience of positive or
negative valence, with the relationship between these two states
typically an excellent indicator of life satisfaction (Diener,
1984). In contrast, the eudaimonic approach focuses on those
characteristics (e.g., mastery and control beliefs, self-growth
and acceptance, self-referent beliefs, social support, and
autonomy) that are related to adaptive functioning (Ryff &
Keyes, 1995). However, increasing degrees of commonality
among these approaches has been demonstrated at the higher-
order factor level (Abbott et al., 2006). Consequently, the
present study includes measures of well-being that are inclusive
of these different approaches.
Another important question for understanding psychological
risk factors for falls is whether changes in factors that are
associated with falling in cross-sectional analyses or at the
population level are also predictive within individuals in
longitudinal analyses. Researchers have stressed that between-
person differences do not necessarily reflect within-person
change (Hofer & Sliwinski, 2001). Therefore, in the present
study, we first assessed the key variables of interest (measures
of well-being) by using population-average models that
estimated whether individuals having poorer scores on
measures of well-being were at increased risk of falling

compared with individuals with higher scores on measures of
well-being. We then used random effects models to evaluate
whether decline in well-being within persons was also asso-
ciated with an increasing fall risk over the follow-up period.
Finally, an important aspect of this study was the inclusion of
a larger number of covariates than are typically incorporated in
falls research. We adjusted for demographic factors, medical
conditions, a measure of cognitive function, and health behav-
iors that have been associated with falling in previous research
(Anstey et al., 2006; Lord et al., 1994; Whooley et al., 1999) to
evaluate the extent to which well-being was independently
associated with falling. Our specific hypotheses were as
follows. First, lower morale, increased depressive symptoms,
and lower expectation of control would be associated with an
increased risk of falling in population-average models. Second,
declines in indices of well-being would be associated with an
increased rate of falling in random effects models. Third, given
the association between falls and several of the covariates
included in this study, we expected effect sizes to reduce
progressively after adjustment for covariates.
METHODS
Participants
We drew the data for this study from the Australian Longi-
tudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA; Andrews, Cheok, & Carr,
1989). Participants provided written consent and the Clinical
Investigations Committee of the Flinders Medical Centre in
South Australia granted ethics approval. Researchers used the
South Australian Electoral Roll as a sampling frame to identify
potential participants aged 70 years and older. They stratified
the sample (N¼2,087) by age and sex into three 5-year cohorts,
that is, 70­74, 75­79, and 80­84; there was a fourth cohort
aged 85 years and older. In addition, partners of participants
aged 65 and older were invited into the study.
Our investigation drew from three waves of data collection
including clinical assessments: Wave 1 was conducted between
September 1992 and March 1993; Wave 3 was conducted in
1994; and Wave 6 was conducted in 2000. Waves 2, 4, and 5
comprised telephone interviews and did not include clinical or
cognitive assessments. We included participants in the present
study (N ¼ 787) if they had answered falls questions at Wave 6.
All of these participants had falls data available at Wave 1, and
only 14 (1.78%) had missing data at Wave 3.
Education and Mini-Mental State Examination
We measured education as the total number of years of
formal education (range ¼ from 0 to 20 years). We used the
clinical cutoff for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
that is, 23 points or fewer on the 30-item version or prorated
equivalent on the 21-item version, to screen out those
participants who had dementia. Researchers also used MMSE
scores as a measure of cognitive functioning to predict falls
among the nondemented participants. At Wave 1, researchers
used a 21-item version of the test (Folstein, Robins, & Helzer,
1983). This test assesses orientation, registration, attention,
calculation, and recall (Teri, Hughes, & Larson, 1990). We
administered the 30-item version at Waves 3 and 6. We
converted the 21-item version to a 30-item scale by using this
formula, (MMSE score/21)330, to match scores from Waves 3
and 6 (Anstey et al., 2006; Luszcz, 1998; Luszcz, Bryan, &
Kent, 1997).
Sensorimotor Measures
We tested corrected distance visual acuity at 3 m for each eye
by using a well-illuminated Snellen chart. The criterion for
distance visual acuity was the smallest line at which the
participant could correctly read at least half of the characters.
We measured grip strength in the dominant hand by using
a dynamometer while the participant was standing. The average
of two attempts at maximum force was recorded in kilograms.
We measured balance with the semitandem stand and a measure
of functional reach. For the tandem stand, participants were
required to stand with the heel of one foot next to the ball of the
opposite foot and to maintain their balance without moving
their feet. Performance was rated according to whether the
participant could hold the position for 10 seconds (coded as 1),
was able to hold the position for less than 10 seconds (coded as
2), or tried but was unable to hold the position (coded as 3).
Functional reach assessed the maximal reach a participant could
achieve while maintaining a fixed-base standing posture. The
average distance in centimeters from three trials was used as the
score.
Health Measures
We obtained health measures during the home interview. We
measured self-rated health (SRH) on a 5-point scale (1 ¼
excellent, 2 ¼ very good, 3 ¼ good, 4 ¼ fair, and 5 ¼ poor). A
self-report questionnaire of 61 medical conditions was based on
measures used in the Duke Longitudinal Studies of Aging
(Palmore, 1970) and the Established Populations for Epidemi-
ologic Study of the Elderly (National Institute on Aging, 1986).
We selected conditions known to affect fall risk for this study as
independent variables, including heart condition or attack,
hypertension, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and diabetes.
We scored all of these as 1 ¼ yes and 0 ¼ no. Information was
also obtained on psychotropic medication (1 ¼ yes; 0 ¼ no),
current smoking (1 ¼ yes; 0 ¼ no) and frequency of alcohol
consumption (1 4 times per month; 2 ¼ 2 to 3 times per
week; 3 ! 4 times per week).
Psychological Well-Being
We measured depressive symptoms by using the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies­Depression scale (CES-D), a 20-item
questionnaire designed to measure depression in community-
based epidemiological studies (Radloff, 1977). Item responses
are in reference to the way the individual felt over the past week.
A 4-point Likert-scale is utilized, with answers extending from
rarely or none of the time (0) to most of the time (3), with scores
ranging from 0 to 60. The CES-D has shown internal
consistencies of .83 in 60- to 69-year-olds and .78 in adults
aged 70 and older, and it has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity
of 73% for detecting clinically significant depression in previous
research (Lewinsohn, Seeley, Roberts, & Allen, 1997). Cron-
bach's alpha was a ¼ 0.84 or 0.85 at each wave.
We measured morale with the five items loading most
strongly on each of the subscales of agitation, lonely
dissatisfaction, and attitude toward own aging from the
Philadelphia Geriatric Centre Morale Scale (Lawton, 1983;
ANSTEY ET AL.
P250
Liang & Bollen, 1983; Luszcz, 1998). The factor structure
of scales has been shown to be invariant across age and gender
in older samples (Liang, Lawrence, & Bollen, 1986). In this
15-item test, with responses of agree or disagree, a higher score
indicates higher morale. Cronbach's alpha was a ¼ 0.81 or 0.82
at each wave.
We measured control with the Expectancy of Control
subscale from the Desired Control Measure (DCM; Reid &
Ziegler, 1980), which asks respondents to indicate the extent to
which they believe they actually have control in areas of
involvement with others, engagement in activities, and health.
The DCM comprises two subscales measuring desire and
expectancy for control in areas found to be important to
psychological well-being of older adults (Reid, Haas, &
Hawkings, 1977). The expectancy subscale appears to be
a more reliable and sensitive measure than either the desire
subscale or a total score, based on summing the cross-products
of the two separate subscales (Reid & Ziegler), possibly
because of the importance of the expectancy of realizing
desired outcomes rather than the desire for control per se. This
12-item scale with five levels of response (1¼ strongly agree,
2 ¼ agree, 3 ¼ neither agree nor disagree, 4 ¼ disagree, and 5 ¼
strongly disagree) was scored such that a higher score indicated
lower control expectancies and hence poorer well-being.
Cronbach's alpha was a ¼ 0.71, 0.75, and 0.77 at Waves 1,
3, and 6, respectively.
Questions on Falling
At Waves 1, 3, and 6 participants answered an injury
questionnaire as part of the larger health and sociodemographic
questionnaire, and this included questions on falls. For this
study, the main dependent variable was falls per year, measured
by this question: ``Have you had any falls in the past year--
including those falls that did not result in injury as well as those
that did?'' Although the gold standard method for reporting
falls is the prospective calendar method, retrospective self-
reports of falls over 6 months have shown an 84% agreement
with falls reported by use of a calendar (Mackenzie, Byles, &
D'Este, 2006), and a meta-analysis has shown that the recall of
falls in the previous year was specific (specificity was 91% to
95%) but less sensitive (sensitivity was 80% to 89%) than
a prospective method of recording falls (Ganz, Higashi, &
Rubenstein, 2005).
Statistical Analyses
We compared sociodemographics, health, sensorimotor
function, MMSE score, and depressive symptoms between
three fall groups at Wave 1 (nonfallers, single fallers, and
multiple fallers) by using a one-way analysis of variance in
which variables were continuous and by using a Pearson chi-
square (v2) test in which variables were categorical. In those
instances in which the expected frequency of a cell was ,5 for
categorical variables, we used Fisher's Exact Test. We imputed
missing item data by using the expectation maximization algo-
rithm, which is an iterative optimization procedure (Graham,
Hofer, & Piccinin, 1994; Schafer & Graham, 2002) available in
SPSS using all available items.
We used marginal models (population-average models) to
estimate between-subject effects of the relationships between
measures of well-being at Wave 1 and rate of falls over the
8 years of follow-up. We used generalized estimating equations
with the log link function and Poisson distribution (Fitzmaurice,
Laird, & Ware, 2004). We assumed the within-subject
association among the vector of repeated outcomes to have an
exchangeable correlation structure (Twisk, 2003). This ap-
proach allows for the full distribution of the falls variable to be
modeled and incorporates all falls data available over three
occasions of measurement, thereby allowing for reliable
longitudinal estimates and maximizing the use of available data.
We used a hierarchical approach to evaluate the relationship
between well-being and falling, with three models being fit to
the data. Model 1 adjusted for time in the study, and demo-
graphic variables (dichotomous: gender; continuous: age, years
of education), to determine the observed associations inde-
pendent of sampling effects. Model 2 added health variables
(categorical: self-rated health, heart condition or attack,
hypertension, stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes,
psychotropic medication, current smoker, and alcohol frequen-
cy) to Model 1. It adjusted for medical conditions and health
behaviors to evaluate the association between well-being and
falling independent of potentially confounding physical health
factors that may lead to poorer physical outcomes and mental
health. Model 3 added sensorimotor variables and cognitive
function (categorical: semitandem stand; continuous: visual
acuity, functional reach, grip strength, and MMSE score) to
Model 2. It tested whether well-being was associated with
falling independent of the sensorimotor factors and cognitive
function shown to affect balance and fall risk (Anstey et al.,
2006; Lord et al., 1994). We used the lowest value as the
reference category for all categorical variables. In those in-
stances in which main effects of well-being measures were
significant, we also tested interactions between time and these
measures after we included all covariates in Model 3.
We examined the effects of within-person change in
depressive symptoms, morale, or control on the rate of falls
(i.e., subject-specific effects) by using random effects models
(random intercept and slope specified for time) using the log
link function and Poisson distribution (Fitzmaurice et al.,
2004). We fitted Models 1, 2, and 3 as specified herein; the
well-being variables were time varying rather than just being
included at Wave 1.
To overcome potential recall bias caused by possible cogni-
tive impairment, we reestimated all marginal models and ran-
dom effects models by excluding participants who scored
below the cutoff score for possible dementia (i.e., ,24; see
Folstein, Anthony, Parhad, Duffy, & Gruenberg, 1985) on the
MMSE at any wave. There were 40 cases at Wave 1, 27 cases at
Wave 2, and 31 cases at Wave 3 (total 4.2% of sample). We
conducted descriptive analyses in SPSS 15.0. We conducted
all longitudinal modeling of the fall rate in Intercooled Stata
9.0.
RESULTS
Sample Attrition and Missing Data
We conducted analyses to evaluate how the sample used in
the longitudinal analyses (N ¼ 787) differed from the remainder
of the sample (n ¼ 1,300) at Wave 1. The selected sample was

over the past 12 months at Wave 1. Compared with nonfallers,
those experiencing one fall were more likely to be female and
have poorer SRH and grip strength. Compared with nonfallers,
multiple fallers were more likely to be older and female; to have
hypertension, stroke, or transient ischemic attack; and poorer
SRH, visual acuity, and grip strength. Multiple fallers were also
more likely than the others to have higher depression, lower
morale, and higher control scores, all indicating lower levels of
well-being. At Wave 1, 24.90% of the sample reported experi-
encing at least one fall in the past 12 months, with this number
increasing to 34.41% and 40.18% at Waves 3 and 6, respectively.
Between-Person and Within-Person Effects of
Well-Being on Falling
Adjustment for Demographic Variables. --Table 2 shows the
results of models of well-being and falls, with adjustment for
demographic variables. Marginal models show the between-
person effects on falls of measures of well-being at Wave 1, and
random effects models show the effect of within-person change
in morale, control, and depressive symptoms on fall rate. The
significant effects for time show that the rate of falling
increased by approximately 5% per annum during the 8 years
of follow-up when we adjusted simultaneously for the
demographic variables and individual well-being measures.
The significant effect for age and gender shows that older adults
and women were more likely than younger adults and men to
fall during the follow-up period. There was no effect of
education on falling.
Higher scores on the Morale scale at Wave 1 were associated
with a lower fall rate. Specifically, a participant who scored one
unit higher on the Morale scale compared with another
participant experienced [1 À (1/incident rate ratio or IRR) ¼
1 À (1/0.91) ¼ 0.10] 10% fewer falls. In the random effects
model, individuals whose morale improved over the follow-up
period had a reduced risk of falling such that for every increase
of 1 point on the Morale scale, an individual reduced her or his
risk of falling by 8%.
Higher scores on the Control scale at Wave 1 were associated
with a higher fall rate. Specifically, a participant who scored
one unit higher (i.e., worse) on the Control scale compared with
another participant experienced 4% more falls. When examined
as a time-varying covariate in the random effects model, control
was not associated with fall rate. This was because there was no
mean change in control from Wave 1 to Wave 6.
Higher scores on the CES-D scale at Wave 1 were associated
with a higher fall rate. A participant who scored one unit higher
on the CES-D scale compared with another participant
experienced 4% fewer falls. In the random effects model,
individuals whose depressive symptoms increased over the
follow-up period had an increased risk of falling such that for
every increase of 1 point on the CES-D score, an individual
increased her or his risk of falling by 4%.
In the marginal models, there were significant Morale 3
Time interactions (b , .01, p , .01) and CES-D Score 3 Time
interactions (b , .01, p , .01), indicating that those with
poorer well-being at Wave 1 had a greater rate of increase in
depressive symptoms over the 8-year follow-up. When we
excluded those participants with MMSE scores of ,24 from
the analyses, we found that the pattern of results for Model 1
was unchanged in both marginal models and random effects
models.
Adjustment for Demographic and Health Variables. --
Table 3 shows the results of models of well-being and falls
as adjusted for demographic variables and health. There were
no changes in the patterns of results for demographic variables
after the addition of the health measures, except that education
became a significant predictor of morale in the marginal
models. Reporting a heart condition, taking psychotropic
medication, and smoking were not associated with falling.
Results for the marginal models showed that those with poorer
SRH, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes at Wave 1 had higher
rates of falling in the subsequent 8 years of follow-up. Results
for alcohol consumption were mixed; those individuals
consuming two to three drinks per week reported an increased
fall rate, whereas those consuming four or more drinks per
week had a reduced fall rate, compared with participants who
consumed four or fewer drinks per month. For the marginal
models, the Time 3 CES-D Score interaction remained
significant (b , .01, p , .01).
Results for medical conditions were slightly less consistent in
the random effects models, with fewer medical conditions
being significant predictors of fall rate. This indicates that the
time-varying well-being covariates explained some of the
variance of the medical conditions. The pattern of results did
not change when we excluded participants with MMSE scores

FALLING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING P253
models of well-being and falls with adjustment for demo-
graphic, health, and sensorimotor variables and MMSE score.
Time, age, and gender continued to be significant, and
education became significant in all marginal models. The
health predictors showed similar patterns of significance as in
the previous models. Visual acuity was not a significant
predictor of falling, but functional reach was significant in all
models, and grip strength was significant in all marginal
models. Semitandem balance was significant in marginal
models for control and CES-D score (those individuals able
to complete the test had a reduced fall rate compared with those
unable to attempt the test). MMSE score was significant in the
random effects models that included control and CES-D score.
The pattern of results for the well-being measures was the same
as in the previous models that did not adjust for sensorimotor
function and cognitive status; all three measures were

associated with fall rate in the marginal models, and time-
varying morale and CES-D score were associated with fall rate
in the random effects models. Results were unchanged when we
excluded participants with MMSE scores of ,24 from the
analyses. In the marginal models, the patterns of interactions
with time remained unchanged after we adjusted for sensori-
motor variables and MMSE score.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study supported our first hypothesis that
between-person differences in Wave 1 depressive symptoms,
morale, and control all predict subsequent fall rate over 8 years
in older adults. We found this effect after adjusting for all of our
covariates, indicating that well-being is an independent pre-
dictor of falling over at least 8 years of follow-up. The fact that
the sample of individuals included in our analysis had better
scores on the well-being measures than those observed in the
full sample shows that those persons persisting in the study
were higher functioning than those in the initial population-
based sample. This suggests that the results of this study may
underestimate the strength of the association between well-
being and falling in the population. At Wave 1 there were no
differences on the three measures of well-being between those
individuals who reported one fall and those who reported no
falls in the previous 12 months. Those who reported falling
more than once in the previous 12 months did report worse
well-being at Wave 1. This suggests that the importance of
well-being is to some extent prognostic, and it is more likely to
be a consequence of the impact of previous falling among those
reporting multiple falls.
Our second hypothesis, that within-person change in well-
being would be associated with change in fall rate, was
supported in relation to depressive symptoms and morale but
not control. Our examination of the estimated marginal means
for control indicated that there was no change between Wave 1
and Wave 6 but that there was a decrease in scores at Wave 3.
This explained the lack of significant effects seen in the random
effects models when we used control as the time-varying
covariate. It seems that the expectancy of control is relatively
stable in late life (Luszcz, 1998) and that individual differences
(rather than within-person change) in this variable are important
for predicting falls. It is possible that domain-specific aspects
of control relevant to physical function may show more
fluctuation as declines in mobility occur. The discrepancy in
results between analyses of between-person differences and
within-person change in control highlights the importance of
using both approaches when one is investigating the signifi-
cance of predictors in longitudinal research.
A particular strength of this study was the control for a wide
range of covariates, and hence the results demonstrate an
independent effect of well-being on fall risk in community-
dwelling older adults. As we expected, a number of the
potentially confounding variables were significantly associated
with an increase in fall rate, including SRH, hypertension,
stroke, diabetes, functional reach, grip strength, and semi-
tandem stand. The association between alcohol consumption
and falling depended on the level of consumption, which is
suggestive of the nonlinear association seen between alcohol
consumption and cognition (Rodgers et al., 2005). Previous
studies have shown that depressive symptoms are associated
with some of the physical function measures used in the ALSA
(Penninx et al., 1998). Depressive symptoms are associated
with antidepressant use and with cognitive decline (Wilson,
Mendes De Leon, Bennett, Bienias, & Evans, 2004), which has
in turn been associated with fall risk (Anstey et al., 2006).
Therefore, by controlling for these potential confounds, the
present study presents a robust finding in relation to well-being
and falls.
Our third hypothesis was that the effect of well-being
would be reduced after we adjusted for the large number of
covariates in our models. This hypothesis was weakly
supported, in that effect sizes did reduce, but in several cases
they remained quite substantial in clinical terms as well as
statistical terms. For example, in the marginal models, even
after we adjusted for all covariates, a reduction of 1 point on
the Morale scale was associated with a 6% increase in fall rate
over 8 years. This suggests that the effect of well-being on
falling was not due to indirect effects in terms of its effect on
the measures of health and sensorimotor function included in
this study.
Study limitations include the lack of a clinical diagnosis of
depression, and the retrospective, self-report nature of our falls
measure. This was overcome somewhat by the exclusion of
participants with possible dementia and the consistency of
results across analyses. The strengths of the study include the
large sample size, multiple follow-ups over a long interval, and,
compared with previous studies, the adjustment for a wide
range of potentially confounding variables. Moreover, to our
knowledge this is the first study to include time-varying
measures of well-being in predicting falls in a population-based
sample over a prolonged period.
The results of the present study may be viewed within the
broader context of the association between psychological and
physical well-being in later life. The fact that morale predicted
falling suggests that researchers should expand the conceptu-
alization of risk factors for functional outcomes to consider the
psychosocial context of the individual. Just as social support is
protective against dementia (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, &
Winblad, 2004), so might strategies to enhance psychological
well-being protect against falling in late life. The Philadelphia
Geriatric Center Morale Scale has been associated with
neighborhood and social characteristics (Breeze et al., 2005)
and is used as a measure of quality of life (Wong, Woo, Hui, &
Ho, 2004). Compared with morale, the influence of depressive
symptoms on fall risk may be more driven by biologically
based mechanisms, particularly those that contribute to poor
concentration and reduction in energy levels. It is possible that
deficits in executive function associated with depression are
also associated with an increase in the risk of falling (Holtzer
et al., 2007).
Potential mechanisms for the association between well-being
and falls may include shared biological factors operationalized
as allostatic load. Better self-monitoring and chronic disease
management resulting from higher levels of psychological well-
being may be protective against accidental falls. Other factors
not examined in this study such as neighborhood, social
support, and access to recreation and services may also
contribute to the overall psychosocial context that predisposes
individuals to falling.
FALLING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING P255
An indication of the need for research on psychosocial
factors associated with falls is seen by surveying the recent
Cochrane review of interventions to prevent falling (Gillespie
et al., 2003). That review identified studies of exercise,
improvements in home safety, medication withdrawal, nutri-
tional and hormone supplementation, vision assessments,
cardiac pacing, and multifactorial interventions, but psychoso-
cial interventions were not included.
The results of this study suggest that falls-risk assessments
should include brief measures of well-being. Psychosocial
interventions that focus on improving positive aspects of well-
being, as well as reducing depressive symptoms, may also
reduce the incidence and prevalence of falls in older adults.
