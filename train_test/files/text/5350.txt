Introduction
School-based interventions aimed at improving staff and,
mainly, pupil mental health, self-esteem, and well-being
have become a feature of the English education system as
they intuitively have considerable reach into the adolescent
population. Previous governments have invested in large-
scale programs aimed at enhancing pupils' social and emo-
tional well-being, especially through the Social and
Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) program, which was
explicitly linked to learning, behavior, and attendance The
SEAL program was extensively evaluated with mixed results
(Hallam, 2009; Humphrey, Lendrum, & Wigelsworth, 2010).
The introduction of the new national curriculum under the
coalition government sidelined SEAL although schools have
been able to keep aspects of it.
This article reports on a small, mixed-methods pilot study
of an intervention aimed to improve the well-being of both
staff and pupils through the use of the Principle Based Model
(PBM; described below). Although there are overlaps with
SEAL especially in SEAL's relationship with self and rela-
tionship with others part of the framework (Garner & Gains,
1996), PBM comes with a broader purpose and is not con-
strained to furthering school aims.
The heavy cost to the system of stress, depression, and
anxiety has been highlighted by Troman (2000). The
Association of Teachers and Lecturers has also shown con-
cerns over the increasing number of youth committing or
attempting to commit suicide, suggesting that academic
demands placed on pupils alongside peer pressure are con-
tributing toward this dramatic increase (Kelley, 2004). Since
1999, education has been a devolved responsibility in the
United Kingdom. Therefore, the Scottish Parliament and the
Assemblies of Wales and Northern Ireland have been able to
set their own education policies. This study was conducted in
England and, thus, the context concentrates on previous
research in English schools.

Using the Principle Based Model to
Improve Well-Being in School: A
Mixed-Methods Pilot Study
Dean Rees-Evans1 and David J. Pevalin1
Abstract
The contemporary school environment in England has been identified as stressful for both staff and pupils. School-based
interventions aimed at improving well-being and mental health have shown mixed results. The Principle Based Model (PBM)
of Mind, Consciousness, and Thought is an untried intervention in English schools and as a working model there is a paucity
of research into its potential. The aim of this mixed-methods pilot study was to investigate the effectiveness of the PBM as a
means of increasing the psychological well-being of staff and pupils. The study was a 16-week pre, post, and follow-up study
using the Friedman Well-Being Scale (FWBS) as a measure of psychological well-being, and analyzed using matched sample
t tests and repeated measures ANOVA. The study was carried out in a high school in the east of England with 10 staff and
nine pupils. The staff and pupils involved received the PBM as a psychoeducational program. During the follow-up period,
six members of staff and one pupil were interviewed and the transcripts analyzed using Thematic Analysis. The pre to post
total FWBS scores showed an increase in psychological well-being for both staff and pupils but only the change for pupils was
statistically significant. Post to follow-up total FWBS scores for both staff and pupils showed no significant change. This study
provides some initial evidence to suggest that the PBM may be a useful tool for schools to utilize in attempting to increase
psychological well-being.

A recent classroom-based, depression prevention, cogni-
tive behavioural therapy (CBT) program for pupils in
England was rigorously assessed using a randomized con-
trol trial design and found that the intervention did not
reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents at high-risk for
depression compared to usual school provision (Stallard et
al., 2013, 2012). The authors caution that further classroom-
based interventions should not be undertaken without fur-
ther research. A qualitative evaluation of the same program
indicated that although the program had some good features
such as relevance of material, especially for younger pupils,
there were issues with the lack of flexibility and consistency
of quality (Taylor et al., 2014). An earlier geographically
broader review concluded that targeted interventions, as
opposed to universal ones, had great efficacy, that most
school-based interventions used a CBT structure, and over-
all the results were mixed with only half the studies report-
ing improvements at posttest or follow-up (Calear &
Christensen, 2010). Regardless of these findings, the case
for supporting adolescents during school had generally been
made and most of the discussions are about how to provide
such services and if teachers are the most appropriate ones
to deliver such programs (Dewhirst et al., 2014; Kidger,
Donovan, Biddle, Campbell, & Gunnell, 2009; Kidger,
Gunnell, Biddle, Campbell, & Donovan, 2010). However,
the current government has reduced the emphasis on pupils'
emotional well-being in the English education system
(Salter-Jones, 2012).
Teachers' occupational stress has been the subject of
much research with well-established factors (Salter-Jones,
2012; Travers & Cooper, 1996; Troman, 2000), and U.K.
teachers have been shown to have worse psychological
well-being than their European counterparts (Griva &
Joekes, 2003). Despite the amount of empirical evidence on
teachers' stress and psychological well-being, they have not
been the subject of interventions designed to help with some
small-scale exceptions (Annan & Moore, 2012; Troman,
2003)
From the perspective of the PBM, the negative behaviors
and symptoms displayed within the school environment
could be alleviated if people were given the opportunity to
understand their own part in the psychological construction
of their feelings. Pransky and McMillen (2013) explained
that at the core of the PBM, the focus is not on what we think
about, but the power of thought through which we all experi-
ence life.
The PBM
The three principles in the PBM are as follows: Mind, the
source of all intelligence; Consciousness, which allows us to
be aware of our existence; and Thought, which guides us
through the world we live in as free-thinking agents. Banks
(1998) explained it this way, "[w]hen you start to see the
power of Thought and its relationship to your way of
observing life, you will better understand yourself and the
world in which you live" (p. 52). The PBM has been known
by a number of names: Psychology of Mind, Innate Health,
and as Health Realization or simply "Principle-Based."
Fuller descriptions and background to the PBM have been
presented in this and other forums (e.g., Kelley, 2003a;
Kelley, Mills, & Shuford, 2005). R. C. Mills (1995) proposed
how the PBM could be administered by looking toward the
health in clients rather than illness and that once an individ-
ual begins to understand what role thought plays in the cre-
ation of their lives, they have more of a tendency to use
thinking more efficiently. Furthermore, once people begin to
see the role of thought, the end result is generally a quieter,
less busy mind, which ultimately leads to a calmer and more
positive state, without the need to attempt the removal of so-
called negative thinking. In other words, seeing thought as
the defining factor in how we see life, leads to a freeing up of
the energy more commonly expended in the endeavor to deal
with life's ups and downs.
The primary focus of the PBM is the health of the indi-
vidual and not the details of their individual lives or their self
perceived problems and difficulties. Thus, it becomes not a
way to reduce stress or anxiety directly, or to attempt to fix
individual thoughts or problems, but as a solution to all of
life's ups and downs by seeing their source as coming from
perception of life via personal thinking.
Kelley (2003a) charted the course of research using the
PBM, the vast majority being conducted in the United States.
First, the focus was on using the model as a therapeutic
approach for adults with, usually, depression. Then the model
began to be used in community empowerment programs;
notably Modello and Homestead Gardens (Pransky, 1998)
and Avalon Gardens (Borg, 2002). These community-based,
mainly qualitative, studies produced impressive results for
reductions in crime and increased attendance and achieve-
ment in the local schools. Kelley's own research has applied
the PBM to the issue of school violence (Kelley, 2003b;
Kelley et al., 2005) and in the police and correctional ser-
vices professions (Kelley, 2005). Furthermore, the PBM has
been shown to have comparable results to a 12-step program
in a female drug treatment program (Banerjee, Howard,
Mansheim, & Beattie, 2007) and has been used as the basis
for an intervention to improve coping and well-being in refu-
gee women (Halcón, Robertson, & Monsen, 2010; Halcón,
Robertson, Monsen, & Claypatch, 2007).
No previous research has been published on the PBM in
schools outside the United States and using pre- and postint-
ervention, individual measures of well-being. In this study,
we hypothesize that the PBM intervention will result in
increased well-being for both staff and pupils.
Method
This study was a quantitative/qualitative (QUANT + qual)
(Morgan, 1998), single-group, pre, post, and follow-up
Rees-Evans and Pevalin 3
design study (Figure 1), collecting primary data using the
Friedman Well-Being Scale (FWBS). Post study in-depth
interviews were carried out at the conclusion of the project,
transcribed, entered into Max QDA 2, coded, and examined
for themes using ThematicAnalysis (Bryman, 2004). Written
consent was obtained from all participants, including paren-
tal consent for the pupils. The school head teacher gave per-
mission for the study and the University of Essex granted
research ethics approval.
Setting/Location
The study was carried out at a high school in the east of
England with an average Ofsted report record. The school
was in a central town setting with a wide catchment area tak-
ing children from both rural and urban homes. The school
also had a relatively high proportion of ethnic minority group
pupils in comparison with other local schools. In addition, a
proportion of children came from socially deprived back-
grounds as the town has three of the top 13 most deprived
council wards in England.
Recruitment
The recruitment process began with a series of discussions
with the head teacher of the school, followed by a presenta-
tion about the study to the entire teaching staff.
After the presentation, all interested staff were given a
handout detailing the outline and time requirements for the
study along with a consent form. For pupils, an information
letter and consent forms were sent home to parents of all Year
Ten pupils. The pupils who volunteered were given a simpli-
fied outline sheet for their information and a consent form.
Sample
Upon recruitment, 10 staff and nine pupils volunteered to
participate in the study. The sample of both staff and pupils
was self-selected following the open recruitment messages at
the school. Two staff members did not complete the follow-
up data collection and one pupil withdrew from the study
during the intervention phase, leaving eight staff members
and eight pupils who completed all stages. At recruitment,
the 10 staff consisted of six males and four females with an
average age of 46 years. The pupil sample consisted of six
males and three females and all pupils were either 14 or 15
years of age.
Intervention
The PBM sessions were facilitated by D.R.-E. and a col-
league, who are both trained PBM practitioners, over an
8-week period with both groups. The pupils' intervention
took place over two extended evenings at the school, and for
the staff, the study began with a 2-day intervention at an off-
site location. During the first 2 days, both the pupils and staff
were introduced to philosophy of the Three Principles, espe-
cially focusing on the idea of Thought, as a principle, creat-
ing individual reality.
The staff and pupil sessions had a similar loose structure,
and much of the same material was covered in both. However,
with the pupils, more of an emphasis was placed on under-
standing self-esteem, via the power of Thought. In addition,
it was explained to both groups how the feelings of empow-
erment or disempowerment are usually a direct result of how
we view the world and how we view the situations that we
find ourselves in, via the power of Thought.
One important aspect of the training for the pupils was the
examination of seeing past the impersonal nature of interac-
tions with other people, that is, beginning to recognize that the
mood level of teachers, parents, siblings, or peers was simply
a result of the other persons thinking, and nothing personal to
them, despite the fact that it appeared that way sometimes.
Both groups were encouraged to see this understanding of
the power of Thought as a generalization, that is, that this
recognition of how Thought plays a contingent part of what
we can potentially take for granted as coming from the out-
side (i.e., objective pressure). Contrasted with seeing pres-
sure as coming from within, from Thought, and therefore
each person has some control over this process when they
become aware of it.
FWBS
The FWBS (Friedman, 1994) contains 20 bipolar adjectives,
and is a simple questionnaire that is easy to score. We used it as
a general measure of well-being, using all 20 items in the
`Friedman Well-Being Composite' (FWBC) and five sub-
scales: emotional stability (FES); self-esteem/self-confidence
Figure 1. Study design and sample numbers.
4 SAGE Open
(FSES); joviality (FJOV); sociability (FSOC); and happiness
(FHAPP) all using the raw to standard score conversion table.
The FWBS was used in two previous PBM studies (Department
of Alcohol and Drugs Services, 2003; A. C. Mills, 2005).
Participants completed the FWBS either in school time in a
separate classroom (pupils) or at the intervention location
(staff). In this study, the FWBC had good internal reliability
with Cronbach's alpha values of .83 (pre), .87 (post), and .91
(follow-up) for the combined sample.
Data Analysis
This study looked at related samples comparisons, from the
pre, post, and follow-up FWBS data using paired sample t
tests and repeated measures ANOVA, separately for staff and
pupils. Statistical significance is set at p < .05, two-tailed
tests. Effect sizes were estimated by Cohen's d for the paired
t tests and Cohen's f2 (Cohen, 1988) using Stata 13. Reliable
change statistics followed Jacobsen and Truax (1991) with
test­retest information from Friedman (1994). The semis-
tructured interviews were transcribed and coded using Max
QDA 2 software, and the transcripts were evaluated using
Thematic Analysis.
Results
The FWBS results are presented in two parts below, the first
(Table 1 and Figure 2) is the FWBC scores for staff and
pupils, and Table 2 presents the FWBS subscale results for
staff and pupils.
Figure 2 shows a dot plot of the pre and post FWBC
scores for staff and pupils along with lines of no change
(solid) and lines of reliable change (dotted). For staff, post
scores are more dispersed and three staff recorded lower
scores than their pretest--one of which exceeded the reliable
change indicator. Three staff recorded increased FWBC
scores that exceeded the reliable change indicator. All pupils
increased their FWBC post scores but only two increases
exceeded the reliable change indicator.
In Table 1, for staff, there is an increase in FWBC scores
at post and follow-up compared to pre. These changes are not
statistically significant but the effect sizes (d = 0.724 and
0.787, respectively) are medium sized. The repeated mea-
sures ANOVA resulted in a nonsignificant result, F(2, 18) =
2.97, p = .077, Cohen's f2 = 0.137, supporting the results of
the paired t tests and an overall small effect size.
For pupils, the pre to post increase is statistically signifi-
cant and the effect size (d = 1.448) is large. This group's
scores decreased from post to follow-up resulting in the dif-
ference from pre being nonsignificant but still with a moder-
ate sized effect (d = 0.699). The repeated measures ANOVA
resulted in a significant difference across the three time
points, F(2, 16) = 6.30, p = .010, Cohen's f2 = 0.285, support-
ing the results of the paired t tests and an overall moderate
effect size.
For the FWBS subscales (Table 2), staff showed only one
statistically significant change from pre to follow-up on the
Joviality (FJOV) subscale. Pupils showed statistically signifi-
cant increases from pre to post on three of the five subscales, the

exceptions being Self-esteem/Self-confidence (FSES) and
Joviality (FJOV). However, only the Emotional Stability (FES)
subscale managed to remain significantly different at follow-up
(compared to pre). In the repeated measuresANOVAtests, none
of the subscales were statistically significant for the Staff group.
For pupils, two of the subscales had statistically significant
repeated ANOVA results: Emotional stability (FES): F(2, 16) =
5.727, p = .013, Cohen's f2 = 0.325 (moderate); and Sociability
(FSOC): F(2, 16) = 5.722, p = .013, Cohen's f2 = 0.174 (small).
Thematic Analysis
Semistructured interviews were carried out with six mem-
bers of staff and one pupil using an interview guide (Table
3). These interviews were conducted to attempt rapproche-
ment (Bryman, 2001) and enhance the findings of the quanti-
tative data analysis, thus creating the opportunity to elucidate
some of the personal experiences that participants had gone
through in light of the training. The transcribed data from the
interviews were open coded into ten main codes: (1)
Expectations and motives; (2) Personal changes; (3) Well-
being; (4) Simplicity; (5) What other people think; (6)
Effecting others; (7) Reduced stress; (8) Changes in others;
(9) Increased awareness; and (10) Potential of the Principles.
Out of these 10 codes, three main themes emerged that of
(A) Expectations and motives; (B) Personal changes; and (C)
Reduced stress. With the remaining coded segments being
either collapsed into subthemes to the main coded texts, or
being dropped. Exploring these themes using extracts taken
from the transcripts, it was possible to create a picture of
change of the individuals.
Theme A: Expectations and Motives
Most staff participants attended simply out of general curiosity
or interest and thought that the training would be more interac-
tive like other training days they had attended as teachers, and
as such some were surprised by the differences:
I was a bit nervous about that cause (you know) I didn't
know what you'd expect us to do, I didn't know whether
we'd have to (you know) enter role-play type activities, or
sit around in groups and bare ourselves to each other.

6 SAGE Open
Those who had a motive to take part other than simply
general interest seemed to have had an experience born out
of a more open mind, and as such potentially gained more
from the experience. At least two of the teachers who volun-
teered had definite reasons for attending, one explained,
I went on the course to find out if I could do a high-pressured
job, be a Mum to very young children and not feel so stressed
after being so ill. (Interview 6)
A second disclosed,
No, I did have a motive, I think after losing [her husband] and
going through bereavement I was on tranquillizers, and all sorts,
so I wanted to kind of find something to help me. (Interview 1)
Theme B: Personal Changes
The changes that some staff expressed during the interviews
appeared to be a reflection of a personal knowing. As if they
intuitively recognized that their life as a teacher, and its effect
upon the pupils could open up in a calmer way and that the
training had led to an increased awareness to this fact:
I have noticed, well, I've been more aware, I've become
increasingly aware of the children at school, of how they are
affected, you know, about what's going on . . . I know all of this,
of course I know, I've always known this, but I'm more sensitive
to it. (Interview 4)
Another participant pointed out that although it was not
the results they might have hoped for it was still a step for-
ward. They put it this way,
Definitely, not [an] earth moving, life changing, earth shattering
moment. But little things that have made my work and my life
better--not all the time, because I forget sometimes, but in certain
situations definitely things have been a lot better. (Interview 2)
Some staff spoke of the ways in which they were respond-
ing to conditions at school or home and how it had become
markedly different. One participant spoke of having been in
a cycle of being stressed at work, invariably feeling tired,
going home, staying up late, not wanting to go to bed, watch-
ing television, and having no desire to "think about any-
thing." Followed by,
Definitely, I mean at work now, I don't get tired when I go home,
I've got more motivation, I've got more patience with all the
pupils and students, and I've seen a difference there, I'm not so
sharp or quick to jump on them. And that's been really good . . .
so yeah, I do feel a lot better. And not so tired, you know I still
go to bed late, but I'm rested (more restful sleep). (Interview 1)
Several staff members explained how they had witnessed
sometimes subtle and occasionally more obvious transfor-
mations in themselves:
I feel calmer, I don't disrupt the school and it's just a little bit
more a professional and easier way to work, somehow. That's a
kind of big change for me . . . really, cause I used to be quite
famous for going off on one, and then coming down straight
away, cause it's all just an act, but that was maybe not a very
good act to have in a way. (Interview 2)
This sense of feeling calmer at school was a revelation to
some staff as it was assumed by most that teaching by its
very nature must be stressful. The distinction between pres-
sure (objective tangible workloads) and stress (as being cre-
ated by our personal thinking about the pressure) was
explored during the interviews. There appeared to be a great
deal of objective pressure on the teachers with considerable
other duties and obligations outside of classroom teaching
(Troman, 2000).
The pupil who volunteered to be interviewed seemed cer-
tain of the changes that had taken place for them, and spoke
with great clarity of their transformations, enumerating them:
Well, I used to get angry really easily, like just little things would
make me really, really angry, and errrm . . . I had a really, really
short attention span, and . . . just . . . Like--I was quite sociable
but, you know, like in a different kind of way--I would see
people but not try and meet new people, but now, it's just all
different really, all three things have changed . . . Because I've
learnt how to (like) interact more and, (don't know) just, what
other people think, because people have the same feelings as me
and so, I can . . . just realize that (approach), easier really.
(Interview 7)
Theme C: Reduced Stress
In many of the interviews, staff pointed toward a reduction in
their levels of stress. One explained,
I think with work I really noticed it last week, when we were
being [Ofsted] inspected, . . . everyone, all the staff were
getting stressed, . . . and I must admit I had no stress at all. I
stayed up the night before, done my lesson plans, but not
stressful, put them on the pen [drive] . . . I know what I'm
going to teach. And I just went in, and so it didn't stress me at
all. But I did see quite a lot of teachers really stressed, and even
the two days after [people] were going off sick and you could
see the stress that they had. And I had none of that which was
lovely. (Interview 1)
One member of staff explained how they had the iniqui-
tous task of dealing with pupils for discipline reasons. Often
these pupils would be very rude and challenging, arriving in
a state of great disharmony, but this teacher found that feel-
ing calmer had made the whole process easier for all involved.
They describe how the pupils
. . . just come and [I] do the paperwork and move on, next one.
I've been doing that really since the course [PBM]. Now, I could
do it before, but I find I'm much more methodical in my calm
Rees-Evans and Pevalin 7
approach to those sort of situations now, because it's better for
everybody. (Interview 2)
The same teacher continued to explain their previous stress
and its perceived personal negative effect upon the school,
prior to the training:
I must have destroyed whole lessons as I'm shouting and yelling
in the corridor--cause it interferes with everybody's learning--
doesn't do any good, might have made me feel better in the
short-term, but . . . still have a little go at home at the kids
sometimes, but I've got better at that as well, cause that was one
of my main aims, wasn't it, that I wouldn't take the pressure
from work home and take it out on the kids. (Interview 2)
This sense of finding a more relaxed way of working
within familiar circumstances seems to point toward the
PBM theory that each individual has within them what is
termed "innate health"; that it is a return to a neutral and
natural state that takes place from an understanding of the
Three Principles, not learning new coping strategies. One
participant talked of a shift in their thinking had and that they
had come to realize that the content of their thinking about
circumstances is what drives stress home or, conversely,
away:
Yeah, but I think a lot more about it since that course [PBM],
about the fact that thought is just a thought. (Interview 3)
The subject of "Thought" and it being the cause of stress
led to much discussion during the training, and the distinc-
tion between the content of our everyday thinking, and
"Thought" as a guiding principle was suggested as a reason
for these differences. Participants were not always com-
pletely comfortable or relaxed during the training, as one
recalls,
I think people are innately suspicious of anything which is [or]
could be branded as alternative. And also people are very
suspicious of anything that involves them doing something
rather than them thinking through things, people are quite
uncomfortable, that was one of my observations, people are
quite uncomfortable doing what they perceive as nothing. Again
that's part of our conditioning, we're used to being force-fed fast
dances. (Interview 2)
Discussion
The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the PBM as
a way of increasing the psychological well-being of staff and
pupils in a school. The total pre to post scores demonstrated
an increase in psychological well-being for both staff and
pupils and with moderate to large effect sizes, but with only
the pupil group being statistically significant. Reliable
change analysis indicates that two pupils and three staff
members' change in FWBC score was marked--although
one staff member did decline in excess of the reliable change
indicator. This tentatively suggests that PBM has a positive
effect on pupils' well-being. Post to follow-up scores for
both groups showed no significant change.
The primary limitation of this pilot study was the short-
ness of its length for both the intervention and the follow-up
period. Future research would benefit enormously if it was
carried out over a longer period of time. Another limitation
was the lack of a control group. The single group design
allowed us to investigate the possible impact of the PBM on
the staff and pupils at this school but without a control group,
we do not know if the changes may have occurred without
the intervention. Furthermore, the small numbers of staff and
pupils and the self-selecting nature of the sample make gen-
eralization unreasonable but the exploratory nature of this
pilot study is primarily designed to inform and/or generate
further research.
Research has shown how the psychological and emotional
state of a child dictates their ability to learn, because it is
emotions that sit behind motivation and the drive to access
education. Additionally, it has been suggested that education
has not fully taken up the responsibility of addressing the
connection between stimulating positive emotions in the
classroom and psychological well-being of staff and pupils
working together (Sylwester, 1994). This study shows the
possibility for some pupils to increase their level of psycho-
logical well-being and thus to potentially recover the incen-
tive to engage in education more positively.
One of the features of this study was the focus on the
health of the individuals during the intervention as opposed
to attempting to trouble shoot or offer solutions for existing
problems that the school or individuals might be dealing
with. Borg (2002) suggested in his community renewal study
that illness, as it appears in a community in general, is not
just organic in nature but also social, and where there is a
social element to suffering, the solution lies in the commu-
nity understanding each other at a deeper level, and then the
solution arises quite naturally from within the community,
along with the Modello Community renewal project
(Pransky, 1998).
The qualitative interviews show how individuals, once
they begin to become more aware of their own innate health
begin to see it in others and thus treat peers and pupils with
more respect and care and ultimately become more effective
and productive in what they do. This, as one participant
noted, can only be better for the school as a whole.
It is important to note that understanding the power of
Thought is not the same as simply thinking positively.
Understanding how thought works aids the development of a
deeper awareness of the power behind thought itself. Put
another way, recognizing that all thought is neutral until it is
given life by the thinker and the direction and focus that peo-
ple as individuals choose to orient themselves.
One final note about the PBM in general and its applica-
tion is that the PBM has been applied in many different
8 SAGE Open
settings, including community and education applications. It
would seem from the evidence available that once individu-
als begin to see how the Principles operate in their lives, this
process has the potential to shift their perspective away from
focusing on the things they do not want in their lives and
toward the things they do want, that is, happier states of
being. It would seem that developing a deeper awareness of
feeling states helps individuals to understand that a mood
shift down into a lower state of consciousness is not some-
thing to become worried about or even something that neces-
sarily requires any action, although it may. Once individuals
begin to understand the source of mood changes their lives
have the potential to change positively.
This study provides some evidence to suggest that where
social, psychological, and emotional improvements are being
sought in education, the PBM may be a useful tool for schools
to utilize in creating greater levels of psychological well-
being and a reduction in stress, with a corresponding increase
in calmness and stability, thus creating a more harmonious
place of work for adults to work, and children to learn in.
However, a limitation (and possible benefit) of the PBM is
that it is partially "reactive" to the group dynamic and cannot
be designed into a protocol. The lack of flexibility in deliver-
ing CBT-based interventions has been previously commented
on (Taylor et al., 2014) and the flexibility of the PBM, in the
hands of trained facilitator, may be one of its benefits.
The findings of this study tentatively suggest the potential
for staff to work in a more relaxed and resilient way, recon-
necting with a more common sense and intuitive approach to
their relationships with peers, senior management, and the
pupils with which they work. As the PBM uses a nontech-
nique-based approach, it is potentially easier for staff to con-
nect with an understanding of the Three Principles, as having
meaning for them in their lives, rather than having to rely on
techniques from the outside, something which often requires
memorization and application. Using the PBM uncovers
resilience within themselves.
The conclusions taken from this study are important as
they show some promising possibilities for further research,
and correspond with the hypotheses that an exposure to the
PBM does indeed lead to a greater experience and level of
well-being for people. They add to the growing body of stud-
ies that are exploring an understanding of the human experi-
ence and of resilience and positive psychological health.
This study is in line with previous research projects carried
out within similar settings and offers great potential hope to
the ever-increasing problems within the education system.
