Abstract
A recent critique of Copping, Campbell, and Muncer raised several issues concerning the validity of psychometric assessment
techniques in the study of life history (LH) strategies. In this reply, some of our key concerns about relying on aggregated psy-
chometric measures are explained, and we raise questions generally regarding the use of higher order factor structures.
Responses to some of the statistical issues raised by Figueredo et al. are also detailed. We stand by our original conclusions and
call for more careful consideration of instruments used to evaluate hypotheses derived from LH theory.

Figueredo et al. (2015) commented on Copping, Campbell, and
Muncer's (2014a) critical examination of psychometric assess-
ment techniques used in the evaluation of human life history
(LH) strategies. We welcome the debate that our article has
stimulated because only through informed and rational dialo-
gue does a field progress. We have structured our response by
first summarizing the aims and findings of our original submis-
sion and answering some specific criticisms raised by Figuer-
edo et al. We then raise issues regarding the specification of
super factors and their underlying rationale. Finally, we raise a
number of statistical issues that we consider to be pertinent to
psychometric LH batteries.
The Original Study
In our original study (Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014a),
we examined the structure of the High-K Strategy Scale
(HKSS; Giosan, 2006), a psychometric index of slow LH strat-
egy, in relation to key life events (pubertal onset, sexual onset,
and number of sexual partners) in order to validate the instru-
ment's suitability for use in LH research. Analysis suggested
that the HKSS did not measure a single, unidimensional con-
struct as represented in the original conceptualization (Giosan,
2006). A single-factor model did not show a good statistical fit
to the data set (based on a sample of over 800 individuals
recruited via a newspaper), and we proposed instead a model
that afforded greater statistical parsimony, while retaining con-
ceptual integrity. Decomposing the scale into four domain-
specific facets appeared to provide the best conceptual and
statistical fit to the data. Several findings emerged that were
contrary to LH predictions (although they were consistent with
evolutionary predictions), and clear sex differences were evi-
dent in the data set. We raised concerns about amalgamating
lifestyle, personality, and behavioral items into a single scale as
an effective measure of LH strategy and called for further work
to clarify the underlying nature of psychometric constructs
used in LH research. We highlighted the need to analyze data
by sex, culture, and social class in order to more clearly exam-
ine LH strategies.

Ours was effectively a foundation study to evaluate the
HKSS as a measurement instrument, a step that is usually
considered essential by scale developers prior to its widespread
use. Such an analysis allows the scale to be evaluated against
recognized psychometric indices and means that potential
item and structural misspecifications can be identified in
advance. Indeed, at the time of writing, 12 published studies
using the HKSS had already been conducted on the assump-
tion that the measure was valid. Had a validation study been
conducted previously, one wonders if so many researchers
would have used this measure. It is important that detailed
psychometric work is conducted to validate scales in any
discipline before mainstream use.
Given the similar theoretical and empirical basis between
the HKSS and other psychometric measures of LH, we tenta-
tively suggested that several of our findings might extend to the
growing assortment of psychometric LH indicators. Figuere-
do's laboratory alone has generated at least five measures of
LH strategy: the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB), the
Mini-K (a short form of ALHB), Super-K (composed of ALHB
þ Covitality þ General Factor of Personality [GFP]), Super-
K1 (Mini-K þ GFP þ Mate Value), and Super-K2 (Mini-K þ
GFP þ Mate Value Inventory þ Mating Effort Scale þ Inten-
tions Towards Infidelity Scale þ Self-Monitoring Scale).
These are described in Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, and
Schneider, (2007) and Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figuer-
edo (2014) and are not inclusive of all variants of so-called K
factors. Figueredo et al.'s response to our article refers, at
different points, to these various inventories. To our knowl-
edge, no detailed, item-level analysis or confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) of the ALHB or the Mini-K has been published
that (a) clearly shows that its structure is unidimensional and
(b) shows consistent relationships with known behavioral indi-
cators of LH theory.
To clarify, we do not necessarily dispute the theoretical
rationales for selecting many of the variables in these scales.
Research consistently shows that factors such as parental
attachments, risk taking, and impulsivity are important factors
associated with strategy trajectory (Belsky, Steinberg, &
Draper, 1991; Brumbach, Figueredo, & Ellis, 2009; Chisholm,
1999; Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2013, 2014b; Ellis,
Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009; Richardson &
Hardesty, 2012). What needs to be considered more carefully
is the utility of aggregating various domain-specific factors into
one domain-general measure.
Biometric and Psychometric Indicators--A False
Dichotomy
In their critique, Figueredo et al. (2015) incorrectly assert that
we consider biometric measures preferable to psychometric
indicators (p. 302). No claim regarding the superiority of bio-
metric/anthropometric to psychometric indicators was made,
nor did we propose a dichotomy between them. Our point was
that researchers should employ both types of measures in order
to examine the relationships between the two. Hence, in sug-
gesting that, ``LH researchers embrace a position where both
measures are incorporated into a more inclusive set of mea-
surement and structural models'' (p. 302), they concur exactly
with our proposal. The thrust of our argument was that the
scales included on measures such as the ALHB (e.g., Insight,
planning and control; Religiosity; Mother/father relationship
quality) do not assess LH strategy as it is usually understood
but rather represent variables that may predict or mediate LH
trajectory (e.g., earlier reproduction, more sexual partners,
lower parental investment). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1,
the summing of these different characteristics (traits, relation-
ships, and lifestyles) to produce a composite score makes it
impossible to examine the relationships between them. As
evolutionary psychologists, we believe our role is to identify
the psychological pathways through which environmental
stress and resource scarcity ultimately impact upon LH tempo.
Figure 1 represents a highly simplified hypothesis about how
this might happen, showing only unidirectional causal relation-
ships. Personality traits may act as moderators or mediators of
the relationship between early experience and LH tempo. Or

Figure 1. Simplified illustration of associations between some concepts discussed in the article. Psychometric inventories of life history such as
Arizona Life History Battery, Mini-K, and Super-K produce a score based on items assessing A, B, C, and D making it impossible to establish the
mediating, moderating, or causal relationships between these variables. Because these inventories do not examine associations with E, it is
unclear whether their model is a life history model as understood in evolutionary theory.

they may be by-products of early experience that are not
causally related to outcomes. Or the associations between
personality and outcomes may be no more than common
genetic effects.
We believe that these are important questions but, following
Figueredo et al.'s (2015) reply, we are not much clearer on their
position. Not only do they accept that their global inventories
``are relatively agnostic with respect to possible causal rela-
tions among its various components'' (p. 314), but they regard
our suggestion of a possible causal relationship (usually called
a hypothesis) as impertinent (``the authors of the critique appar-
ently presume to know which of the various LH traits being
measured are causal to the others. To a philosopher of science,
this degree of confidence would appear remarkable,'' p. 314).
Elsewhere, they hedge their bets by noting a bidirectional
relationship between biometric and psychosocial traits
(p. 305) and by supporting a developmentally contingent
model while citing genetic correlations between indicators
and outcomes (pp. 314­315).
LH theory was born out of comparative biological measures
(Pianka, 1970; Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992). Although it is true
that the field of human LHs in particular has moved on sub-
stantially from earlier incarnations, ignoring markers of repro-
ductive fitness essentially ignores the fundamental principle of
LH theory which is about the allocation of effort between key
biological tasks (e.g., growth and reproduction) that translates
ultimately into lineage continuation. If we fail to measure key
life events and instead restrict our measurement to domains
such as personal relationships, religiosity, and self-control (as
in the ALHB), we are not measuring LHs but lifestyles. Psy-
chological mechanisms are doubtlessly important in the devel-
opment of LHs in humans, and a corpus of literature supports
this assertion (Belsky et al., 1991; Brumbach et al., 2009;
Chisholm, 1999; Copping et al., 2013, 2014b; Ellis et al.,
2009; Richardson & Hardesty, 2012). However, establishing
which particular psychological mechanisms are important to
different strategies is equally vital. If the purpose of a func-
tional psychological adaptation is to increase the probability of
reproductive success, such mechanisms should be demonstra-
bly related to biological indices of that goal. If this is not the
case, how can any psychological mechanism be truly called an
adaptation? Figueredo et al. make the distinction between the
``means [functional processes] and ends [distal achievements]
of behaviour'' (2015, p. 302) and claim that we endorse a
process that would only highlight the ends (fitness outcomes).
As clearly noted originally however (Copping et al., 2014a,
p. 217), most researchers in the modern evolutionary sciences
do not advocate for a purely ``counting babies'' approach nor
focus purely on fitness maximization (Nettle, Gibson, Lawson,
& Sear, 2013). We are as interested in the means as well as the
ends when it comes to strategy development, but in particular,
how the means facilitate the ends. To achieve this goal, what is
needed is a closer examination of biological indicators in rela-
tion to environmental context and psychological, cognitive,
and behavioral data. After all, how can the validity of processes
or means that are hypothesized to be driving strategy be
evaluated without reference to the fitness outcomes or ends
in which we believe they result?
Fast LH Strategies
In their critique, Figueredo et al. explicitly state that ``faster LH
strategists should invest more energy in reproductive effort,
and particularly in mating effort'' (2015, p. 305). Few would
disagree with this as a key characterization of faster LHs. For
this reason, we (Copping et al., 2014a) deliberately picked 3
items considered to be indicative of a faster LH strategy and
greater mating effort: accelerated development (i.e., earlier
pubertal onset), earlier age of reproductive onset, and greater
numbers of sexual partners. These three variables are widely
acknowledged as indicators of the pursuit of faster strategies,
and it is not by chance that these particular variables (or their
equivalents) feature heavily in many studies exploring human
LH (e.g., Belsky, Schlomer, & Ellis, 2012; Chisholm, 1999;
Dishion, Ha, & Veronneau, 2012; Ellis et al., 2003; James,
Ellis, Schlomer, & Garber, 2012; Quinlan, 2003; Simpson,
Griskevicius, Kuo, Sung, & Collins, 2012). These measures
are theoretically appropriate criteria for examining the validity
of a measure that proposes to index psychological correlates of
fast and slow LH strategies.
Figueredo et al. propose that, due to cultural developments
and ecological constraints associated with Western, Economic,
Industrial, Rich, and Democratic societies, ``we should not
necessarily expect that the main effects of LH indicators like
the Mini-K or the HKSS will be statistically significant or very
large in magnitude when predicting such fitness outcomes.'' If
fitness outcomes are not associated with LH indicators, surely
it raises grave questions either about the relevance of LH theory
to an explanation of contemporary western human behavior or
about the validity of LH indicators. Remaining with Figueredo
et al.'s example of mating effort, research generally shows that
attitudes, desires, and beliefs about mating tend to correlate
significantly with actual mating behaviors on a population level
(Jackson & Kirkpatrick, 2007; Penke & Aspendorf, 2008;
Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). A similar case could be made
for other behaviors consistent with fast strategies such as
aggression (Archer & Graham-Kevan, 2003; Huesmann &
Guerra, 1997). If beliefs and intentions toward a given behavior
correlate with the same behavior, then we would expect an
inventory focusing on processes calibrated toward increased
mating effort to be related to actual mating effort. Thus, an
index of fast LH strategy should correlate substantially and
in the expected direction with measures of mating behavior
and aggression (or other indices of fast strategy execution) at
the population level. Although several relationships in our
study corroborated predictions made from evolutionary theory,
a unitary K dimension was not apparent in this data set.
LH indicators should show some relationship to behaviors
consistent with the execution of the strategies they purport to
measure. Indeed, in studies that do not use aggregated psycho-
metric indices (and instead measure specific ecological, psy-
chological, biological, or behavioral factors), the expected
Copping et al. 3
correlations tend to hold (Belsky et al., 2012; Chisholm, 1999;
Copping & Campbell, 2015; Copping et al., 2013; Dishion
et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2003; James et al., 2012; Quinlan,
2003; Simpson et al., 2012). However, studies using LH bat-
teries often fail to find the expected relationships. If specific
variables predict strategy patterns in the real world, what is the
value of aggregating them in such a way as to mask these
relationships? For instance, the relationships of the ALHB with
socially antagonistic attitudes and socially antagonistic beha-
viors were not significant (r ¼ À.12 and À.07, respectively;
Wenner, Bianchi, Figueredo, Rushton, & Jacobs, 2013). Old-
erbak and Figueredo (2012) reported the relationship between
the Mini-K and mating effort as r ¼ À.03. Olderbak et al.
(2014) found that mating effort was not significantly related
to the ALHB (r ¼ .05), the Mini-K (r ¼ .12) or the HKSS (r ¼
À.07). Figueredo, Gladden, and Hohman (2012) showed in a
structural model that mating effort and aggression were both
subsumed by another latent dimension named ``Psychopathic
and aggressive attitudes'' which was not directly related to
slow LH strategy. When developmental trajectory is factored
in, the singular dimension of the K strategy is also question-
able. Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009) concluded that
slow LH and social deviance were separate dimensions in ado-
lescence and young adulthood, suggesting that a singular LH
dimension may not emerge until later adulthood. Similar find-
ings were made by Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swo-
boda (2014) and have recently been corroborated (Richardson,
Dariotis, & Lai, in press; Richardson et al., in press). It is clear
that the relationship between indices of mating effort, compe-
tition, and LH strategy is more complex than a single dimen-
sional approach would have us believe.
Other studies have shown that mating effort does tend to
load negatively on K (albeit weakly) when a higher order super
factor (Super-K) is employed (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2012;
Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014). As the nomo-
logical net is widened, other factors inevitably begin to be
included through their relationships with other variables such
as life expectancy (which has strong links to aggression and
reproduction: Chisholm, Quinlivan, Petersen, & Coall, 2005;
DuRant, Cadenhead, Pendergrast, Slavens, & Linder, 1994;
Wilson & Daly, 1997), intelligence, personality, and beyond
(Olderbak & Figueredo, 2010; Rushton, 2004). Despite this, the
relationship between mating effort and the Super-K remains the
weakest link (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2012; Olderbak et al.,
2014). This is puzzling when one considers the ultimate func-
tion of a LH strategy is to facilitate reproductive ends.
The super factor aside (which we return to later), the purpose
of the original study was to validate a specific measure; the
HKSS. From the point of validating it against indices of mating
effort consistent with a fast LH strategy, it would appear that the
HKSS does not work as predicted. Alternatives (such as the
Mini-K or ALHB), used as stand-alone instruments or as part of
a larger super structure, do not appear to consistently demonstrate
predictedrelationshipswithotherindicesoffastLHstrategy.This
raises questions about what some of these psychometric invento-
ries actually measure and thus their validity.
The Environment
As advocates of plasticity throughout development (West-
Eberhard, 2003), we acknowledge the pivotal role of the early
environment in the development of LH trajectories. Much of
our previous work emphasizes this point (e.g., Copping &
Campbell, 2015; Copping et al., 2013) and supports theoretical
proposals (Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm, 1999; Ellis et al.,
2009) of key environmental factors that predict levels of crime,
aggression, teenage pregnancy, and short-term mating orienta-
tion. The wider developmental environment is indeed of para-
mount importance. However, accurate measurement of the
wider environment is difficult, even more so if assessed retro-
spectively. In the absence of a well-validated, easy to admin-
ister questionnaire that accurately captures the developmental
environment, many researchers are unable to examine the prox-
imate causal factors of LH strategies. Although measuring the
environment is easier said than done, some notable attempts
have been made (Belsky et al., 2012; James et al., 2012; Simp-
son et al., 2012). Despite Figueredo et al.'s emphasis on the
importance of the early environment, many studies using the
HKSS, ALHB, or the Mini-K do not assess it. Although the
ALHB asks questions regarding the quality of childhood rela-
tionships with parents (an indication of developmental stabi-
lity), it does not go beyond this. However, theory and research
indicate that stress, uncertainty, and unpredictability are trans-
mitted not just via the immediate familial environment (Cop-
ping & Campbell, 2015; Copping et al., 2013) but can operate
in complex ways in relation to strategy-related variables
(Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swoboda, 2014;
Richardson et al., in press). Factors such as local morbidity,
extrinsic mortality, unemployment, resource scarcity, mobility,
and socioeconomic status have been suggested as being pivotal
to strategy formation (see Ellis, Schlomer, Tilley, & Butler,
2012; Chisholm, 1999; Copping & Campbell, 2015; Copping
et al., 2013). These however are rarely examined in relation to
the ALHB, the Mini-K, the Super-K, or the HKSS.
Furthermore, these batteries do not address the complexities
of the early family environment (which is often purported to be
the main contributing factor: Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm,
1999). The Mini-K contains just two items asking about early
relationships with mother and father (e.g., ``While growing up,
I had a close and warm relationship with my biological
father''). Responses to this item do not address the key factors
about paternal and father-figure relationships. Although a vast
corpus of literature suggests that father absence is a critical
factor in strategy development (Belsky et al., 1991; Draper &
Harpending, 1982; Ellis, 2004; Ellis et al., 2003), there are
many caveats. For instance, the death of a father does not lead
to the same outcomes as abandonment by the father (Hether-
ington, 1972). Step parenting, alloparental care, and other par-
enting strategies are also important to the expression of later
LH strategy (Sear & Mace, 2008; Sheppard, Garcia, & Sear,
2014; Sheppard, Schaffnit, Garcia, & Sear, 2014; Sheppard,
Snopkowski, & Sear, 2014). These are not encompassed in the
ALHB or Mini-K, and the wider environment is rarely
4 Evolutionary Psychology
considered. Although it is right that measures of parental
investment should be considered in studies investigating LH
strategies, they should be measured within the broad context of
strategies and not aggregated within a wider set of theoretically
relevant (or potentially irrelevant) indices. Although Figueredo
et al. are right to raise the importance of the environment, most
psychometric research employing measures such as the HKSS,
the Mini-K, and so on (including their own) does not ade-
quately encompass it.
The Super-K
Figueredo et al. consider the Super-K factor to represent a
wider nomological net capturing personality (GFP) and health
(Covitality) in addition to domains covered by the ALHB (e.g.,
see Dunkel, Mathes, & Harbke, 2011; Figueredo et al., 2014;
Gladden, Sisco, & Figueredo, 2008; Olderbak & Figueredo,
2010, 2012). Incorporating measures into ``more inclusive set
of measurement and structural models'' is critical to the proper
evaluation of theory and few would disagree with this. How-
ever, care must be taken in their use and interpretation. The
K-factor approach loads scale totals onto one factor or creates a
super factor from a series of hierarchically structured factors.
To some degree, this approach blurs rather than clarifies the
key relationships of interest. Figueredo et al. acknowledge that
global inventories are ``causally agnostic'' (2015, p. 314). With
so many indices loading (sometimes weakly) onto one global
hierarchical construct, it is impossible to examine key relation-
ships that underpin milestones of developing LH strategies in
any meaningful way. In Figure 1 (Biometric and Psychometric
Indicators--A False Dichotomy section), we illustrated with a
simplistic model how LH traits may emerge through a series of
environmental triggers, biological life events, psychological
mediators, and behavioral outcomes. In a model using higher
order factors, where all of these different events and processes
are reduced and loaded onto one scale, we cannot meaningfully
discriminate between them. This is particularly problematic
when items are parceled (which we will address later). How-
ever, examination of these key relationships is crucial to
enhance our understanding of how strategies develop, under
what conditions, and via which psychological and/or biological
mechanisms.
It may be that a series of higher order factors load on to each
other in an increasingly hierarchical fashion. As our critics
correctly assert, biological traits in animals have been shown
to cluster together predictably (Promislow & Harvey, 1990;
Rushton, 2004). We do not disagree with the proposal that a
similar dimension may exist in humans. What we dispute is the
choice of measures within these lower order factors and the
lack of evidence that these lower order factors work as mea-
surement instruments prior to aggregation, when a similar
approach is applied to humans.
For example, on an all-encompassing measure of the Super-
K, imagine that one individual scores highly on measures of
mate value and exclusively pursues short-term sex, is very
intelligent (high g) and has a long-life expectancy. Another
individual scores highly on conscientiousness and agreeable-
ness, favors long-term pair bonds, and has a lower g and life
expectancy. A final individual is married with children but is
also a clandestine adulterer with a high g and a long-life expec-
tancy. These three individuals could have very similar overall
scores on a Super-K strategy battery, despite the fact that they
vary markedly on various subscales and are in reality pursuing
radically different strategies. Aggregating many related facets
into a global K score means that the ability to discriminate
within the range of strategic possibilities is lost and raises
questions about what this aggregate score is actually telling
us. Figueredo et al. are right to acknowledge that there are a
range of contingent LH strategies (see Ellis et al., 2009) that
can exist within the scope of the K continuum but does their
measurement approach really allow us to identify the range of
strategies in play? The complex interplay of factors that repre-
sents a person's strategy and their developmental trajectory are
lost using this approach (see Del Giudice, 2014; Richardson
et al., in press, for an illustrative example of such complexity).
Figueredo et al. (pp. 312­314) consider how their measures
might be used to incorporate a developmental dimension, pre-
senting a model purportedly testing a Bronfenbrenner-inspired
developmental sequence (Garcia, Cabeza de Baca, Sotomayor-
Peterson, Smith-Castro, & Figueredo, in press). Model fitting is
used to demonstrate that development is best described by a
hybrid model in which Mini-K directly informs different stages
in the sequence while each stage also affects the subsequent
stage. However, the inclusion of these factors does not conform
to the developmental sequence implied by most proponents of
psychosocial acceleration theory. The evidence of the last two
decades has culminated in a relative consensus that forms the
basis of recent proposals of how strategies may emerge, such as
the Adaptive Calibration Model (Del Giudice, Ellis, & Shirt-
cliffe, 2011; Del Giudice, Hinnant, Ellis, & El-Sheikh, 2012).
The proposed hybrid model (Figueredo et al., 2015) however
bears little relationship to this (or other) models. Although the
first developmental stage (biological mother and father) repre-
sents a retrospective assessment of parental relationships in
childhood, the remaining stages are concurrent measures of
existing relationships and activities (culminating in regular
religious practices) placed in an arguably arbitrary order. Given
that the Mini-K itself is a truncated version of the ALHB scales
used to assess each of these ``stages'', it is unsurprising that
they are correlated--but it is a substantial leap from this corre-
lation to asserting a genetic influence on LH development.
Despite Figueredo et al.'s emphasis on the environment, there
is no treatment of environmental influences (stressors on par-
ents and the individual, indices of local competition or resource
access) that could play a role in the expression of any of these
behaviors or traits.
Our second objection relates to how these higher order fac-
tors are constructed. The underlying logic of the Super-K relies
on an increasingly hierarchical model of theoretically related
factors that culminate in a representation of an individual's
strategy. However, research shows that in some complex con-
structs, this is not a valid way to represent a phenomenon. For
Copping et al. 5
instance, the GFP is one of three factors composing the Super-
K along with the K factor and covitality (Musek, 2007; Rush-
ton, Bons, & Hur, 2008; Rushton & Irwing, 2011). The GFP is
often constructed from either constituent personality traits
(such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuro-
ticism, and openness) or from loading multiple personality
inventories onto one factor assuming that all relate to a single
common latent. This approach to the measurement of person-
ality however has been widely questioned recently (e.g., Hop-
wood, Wright, & Donnellan, 2011; Muncer, 2011). Revelle and
Wilt (2013), in a review of existing GFP studies concluded that
(a) this analytical approach to personality is often fundamen-
tally flawed, (b) the overall magnitude of a general personality
factor is not great enough to be genuinely meaningful, and (c)
GFP is a less useful approach to analyzing individual differ-
ences than using lower level constructs. More recently, evolu-
tionary psychologists have also claimed that GFP is not ``a
clean indicator of fast-slow variation in personality'' (Del Giu-
dice, 2014, p. 397). Similar to our earlier point, merging per-
sonality traits onto a single dimension simply distorts the real
impact of personality traits on LH strategies. If, like GFP, the
lower order factors in their own right are more useful, why load
them into higher order structures?
Our point here (since the wider debate regarding GFP is not
the central theme of this article) is that if we cannot apply such
an analytic technique effectively to one dimension subsumed
by a supposed Super-K factor, why should we expect it to work
with (a) other higher order constructs such as K and covitality
and (b) even higher level latent variables such as the Super-K
itself? If we cannot meaningfully interpret a higher order factor
such as GFP on its own, what does it represent when aggregated
into a single super factor structure or factor score? Most studies
employing the Super-K report only the final factor loadings
rather than providing data on the underlying structure of the
constituent latent traits. Instead they rely on parceled inventory
scores (a limitation to which we will return shortly), so that we
are unable to establish with confidence whether factors (from
higher order GFP to lower orders such as religiosity, altruism,
mating effort) are valid representations of the facet(s) they
purport to measure. This potentially obscures the meaning of
the Super-K factor and may cause over or underestimations of
relationships between it and other relevant LH traits.
Furthermore, some incorporations of the Super-K may over-
estimate factor loadings and thus make the Super-K appear
psychometrically stronger than it actually is. For instance, Old-
erbak et al. (2014), present data of a proposed Super-K struc-
ture that includes the subscales of the ALHB and the Mini-K
loaded onto one factor. One must question why this has been
done when the Mini-K is effectively a short form of the ALHB.
There is considerable overlap of the content domain which is
likely to inflate estimates of factor loadings. Interestingly, cor-
relations between the components of the ALHB and the Mini-K
itself are by Cohen's (1969) criteria small to medium at best.
Olderbak et al. concluded that ``the Mini-K, ALHB, and Super-
K factor 1 are the most convergent measures of LHS'' (2014,
p. 86) with the HKSS loading less cohesively with these
measures. This is hardly surprising when one considers that the
Mini-K and the ALHB are effectively the same thing: Why
would they not be expected to load together? The proposed
developmental hybrid model (p. 313) presumably is similarly
flawed given that the Mini-K is being used to predict factors
that the Mini-K actually includes in its measures.
Finally, Figueredo et al. emphasize the importance of higher
order single-factor structures for the purposes of studying LH
theory. If these models are to have utility, we should expect to
see that these single-factor structures offer greater parsimony at
no expense to model fit when compared to lower order multi-
dimensional structures. In studies that have explicitly tested
this assumption, this has not been found to be the case. Copping
et al. (2014a) found that a four-factor model, not a unidimen-
sional one, fit data from the HKSS inventory better. Richardson
et al. (2014), using data from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth 1997 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of
Labor, 2013) found that a unidimensional structure did not fit
the data, or that a single LH strategy factor did not subsume all
LH indicators. Richardson et al. (in press) also found statisti-
cally independent mating competition and Super-K dimensions
(implying that a single dimension was not plausible) when
modeling LH strategy from Midlife in the United States data.
Finally, Richardson, Dariotis, and Lai (in press) also found that
a two-dimensional model fits the data better than a single-
factor model in a predominantly urban sample of young adults.
We, therefore, echo Revelle et al. (2013) and suggest that in-
depth analyses of lower order constructs is ultimately much
more useful to study the specifics of LH strategy than higher
order super factors.
Statistical Issues
We now briefly turn to three issues we consider important in
the interpretation of the results of LH studies which use psy-
chometric measures such as the ALHB, the Mini-K, and the
HKSS.
Reliability of Measurement
The use of reliability coefficients (Cronbach's a) and the use of
fit statistics were questioned by Figueredo et al. in relation to
our interpretation of the HKSS as a measure. The HKSS in our
study showed a high a (.86) and thus demonstrated a high
degree of internal consistency. Figueredo et al. make the point
that this is an impressive result given how short the inventory is
(only 26 items). This is an odd claim, considering that the Mini-
K, which is held to be the superior measure, is shorter still (at
only 20 items) and often yields similar reliabilities, with an
average around .70 according to Figueredo et al. (2015). Even
stranger is the fact that colleagues of Figueredo have reported
even higher reliabilities (.90) for the HKSS (Gladden, Welch,
Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2009).
Our critics also criticize the reliability of one-item mea-
sures. Although the general convention is to avoid the use of
single-item measures, greater use of single-item measures is
6 Evolutionary Psychology
becoming prevalent in the social sciences and arguments for
their use have been made (Hayduk & Littvay, 2012). Cron-
bach's a statistics are dependent on the number of items present
in a scale and the number of respondents in the sample. Simply
increasing the number of items and/or participants will nor-
mally increase reliability. Worryingly, many often believe a
can be used on its own as a proxy for unidimensionality. This is
of course not so. As demonstrated by Green, Lissitz, and
Mulaik (1977), merging a series of orthogonal scales into one
larger scale will still yield high reliability estimates despite the
fact that the underlying items do not represent a unidimensional
construct. The revised HKSS with separate subscales that we
proposed in our analysis is a case in point (where the individual
subscales have lower reliabilities than a single scale). Across
many fields within the social and behavioral sciences, research-
ers have composited scales on the basis of large Cronbach's a
coefficients, despite decades of research demonstrating that
coefficient a`s assumptions are rarely satisfied in practice
(Bentler, 2009; Green & Yang, 2009; Sijtsma, 2009) and that
it does not provide information about internal structure
(Sijtsma, 2009).
Reliability alone does not ensure validity. Validity of a con-
struct is much more important to establish. Although it is good
news that the constructs had at least acceptable internal con-
sistency, this is redundant if the reliably measured constructs
are themselves misspecified. It is for this reason that models are
compared and evaluated using a range of fit statistics and their
relationships with theoretically pertinent variables associated
with the construct examined. In this way, the question of what
K actually is and how it should be measured can be addressed.
The use of fit statistics in our study is consistent with general
practice in the field of psychometrics (including previous
works by our critics; e.g., Brumbach et al., 2009; Gladden,
Sisco, & Figueredo, 2008; Olderbak et al., 2014) and the inter-
pretations regarding the validity of this measure are justified
based on the available data set. We thus maintain that our
original work was far from ``psychometrically invalid,'' as our
critics claim it to be.
Problems of Statistical Conclusion Validity
One of the criticisms we made in our original article was the
over reliance on undergraduate samples to draw conclusions
about strategy development in the wider population. In order to
establish comparability between samples and hence validate
generalization between them, Figueredo et al. reviewed evi-
dence that distributions among undergraduate students on mea-
sures such as the ALHB and Mini-K do not appear to differ
appreciably from those found in the general population
(pp. 309­311; see Figueredo et al., 2014). Although this
evidence helps to establish descriptive similarity between
samples, it does not ensure that undergraduate students share
the same pattern of causal relationships with other young adult
subpopulations or the general young adult population. We can-
not be sure we are looking at the same construct across samples
without first establishing measurement invariance (Brown,
2006). In other words, it is not clear that the relationships
among indicators believed pertinent to LH strategies are man-
ifestations of the same common construct (the K or super fac-
tor) across samples. In addition, even if measurement
invariance holds, the associations of a factor representing stra-
tegies with other variables may vary across samples even when
its means and variances do not (Little, 2000). Of course, it is
not easy to identify subpopulations that are causally homoge-
neous for the functional relations linking predictor or outcome
variables with LH measures. Painstaking efforts are required to
test these relations for invariance (e.g., see Kline, 2011; Bollen,
1989; Brown, 2006). In the end, researchers may find causal
heterogeneity such that generalization to a broader (e.g.,
national) population is not warranted. However, without testing
for causal invariance, researchers risk accepting estimates that
are inaccurate descriptors of some or possibly many groups.
One methodological approach that can help LH researchers
discover and model heterogeneity is factor mixture modeling,
in which researchers can discover latent classes with the same
structure but allow parameters to vary (see Henson, Reise, &
Kim, 2007; Lubke & Muth´
en, 2005; Lubke & Spies, 2008).
When the identity of groups is known, multiple group structural
equation modeling can also be used to test a K factor for con-
struct level metric invariance (e.g., across cultures; Frazier,
Tix, & Baron, 2004). Because the K factor is purportedly an
adaptation, it is important to show that its structure does not
differ across human groups. On an additional note, although
Figueredo et al. (2015) identified studies of LH measures that
used nationally representative data (e.g., Brumbach et al., 2009,
see also Richardson et al., 2014), it is still clearly the case that
the vast majority relied on undergraduate student data. Efforts
to address this limitation should continue.
Sex Differences in LH Strategy
In our original article, we found significant sex differences and
pointed out that insufficient attention had been paid to sex in
terms of both measurement (data are often not disaggregated by
sex and neither sex invariance nor differences are tested) and
theory (given the different reproductive roles of males and
females it would be surprising if LH trajectories were not
affected). Figueredo et al. claim that sex has been well explored
in the literature in relation to measures of K and cite four
studies. Yet Figueredo, Cabeza de Baca, and Woodley (2013)
is a review that makes no real mention of sex differences spe-
cific to K. The remaining three studies are jointly composed of
an undergraduate sample of approximately 431 males and 450
females (Figueredo, Andrzejczak, Jones, Smith-Castro, &
Montero-Rojas, 2011; Gladden, Figueredo, Andrejzak, Jones,
& Smith-Castro, 2013; Gladden et al., 2008). While some sex
differences are reported, there is little discussion regarding
their nature and little exploration of sex differences within the
measures themselves. Gladden, Sisco, and Figueredo (2008) is
perhaps the most detailed of the four cited papers, but no invar-
iance testing is performed. Due to the small sample sizes and
large numbers of items, the Mini-K has been parceled and
Copping et al. 7
aggregated into a higher order K structure (discussed earlier)
making it impossible to test for item invariance across males
and females. Figueredo et al. (2015, p. 309) claim to find
``systematic sex differences of between one-quarter to one-
third of a standard deviation between sexes, with males being
predictably ``faster'' than females.'' However, as the cited
papers do not present sufficient data to allow readers to make
sense of this small effect size, it is difficult to interpret the true
significance of this finding. It also raises further questions. In
which inventories, domains, and items are the sex differences
located in the K factor? Is there any evidence of structural
invariance over sex on any of the measures employed? These
important questions require answers given the extensive evo-
lutionary literature on sex differences in mating competition,
aggression, parenting, risk taking, and sexual behavior, to
name but a few (Archer, 2004, 2009; Buss & Schmitt, 1993;
Campbell, 1999; Cross, Copping, & Campbell, 2011; Jackson
& Kirkpatrick, 2007; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; Trivers,
1972; Wilson & Daly, 1985). It is likely that sex has a much
larger part to play in strategy development than the current
psychometric literature suggests. Below we detail the reasons
why we would expect biological sex to impact upon LH
strategy formation.
A faster LH tempo prioritizes earlier reproduction over
somatic growth, current over future reproduction, mating over
parenting, and offspring quantity over quality. Given
women's higher parental investment and men's consequently
greater fitness variance, men as a sex are characterized by a
faster LH tempo, as evidenced in physical (e.g., upper body
strength) and psychological (e.g., aggressiveness) sex differ-
ences. A shift toward a fast LH tempo for women may entail
different adjustments as a result of sex differences in mini-
mum parental investment. There may also be sex differences
in (sensitivity to) the cues that signal environmental stress
and trigger LH trajectory change.
For men, women are a limiting resource. Mating with mul-
tiple women offers the opportunity for extreme reproductive
success. Paternal investment is facultative and deserted moth-
ers generally assume the burden of child care. There is little
evidence that father absence results in decreased offspring
fitness (Sear & Mace, 2008), but such costs could be compen-
sated for by the extra offspring resulting from a serial short-
term reproductive strategy. We would expect that male traits
enhancing mating success would be selected for, both those
associated with intrasexual competition (aggression, domi-
nance striving, sensation seeking) and intersexual competition
(facial features signaling ``good genes,'' e.g., symmetry, mas-
culinity, dominance). According to Del Giudice (2009), envi-
ronmental stress, signaled to the developing boy through
disrupted family relationships, fosters the development of avoi-
dant attachment (correlated with aggression, self-reliance, and
inflated self-esteem) which serves as a psychological adapta-
tion for short-term relationships in adulthood. Dark Triad traits
have also been implicated in a fast LH strategy (McDonald,
Donnellan, & Navarrete, 2012) via strategic deception
(Machiavellianism), egocentrism (Narcissism), and absence
of empathy (Psychopathy). Not yet explored is the possibility
of downregulation of typical ``fathering'' adaptations seen
following fatherhood such as the testosterone reduction and
oxytocin enhancement.
Women's adoption of a fast LH strategy has focused on
earlier age of sexual maturity, sexual initiation, and first birth.
A meta-analysis of 33 independent effect sizes confirms an
association between father absence and earlier menarche,
d ¼ 0.28 (Webster, Graber, Gesselman, Crosier, & Schember,
2014) and in father-present families, a closer relationship with
daughters predicts later menarche (Ellis, 2004). Earlier
menarche is associated with a longer reproductive lifespan,
early initiation into sexual activity, earlier age of first
pregnancy, and increased risk of teenage pregnancy (Coall,
Tickner, McAllister, & Sheppard, 2016). Although Del Giudice
proposed that boys are more likely to respond to early family
dysfunction by forming avoidant attachments, girls are more
likely to form anxious/ambivalent attachments. Such attach-
ments are associated with abandonment anxiety and over-
dependency and in adulthood earlier initiation into sexual
activity and willingness to engage in sex to secure their part-
ner's attention. An unrestricted sociosexual orientation appears
to be more closely allied to the quality of parenting rather than
father absence (Coall et al., 2016; Ellis et al., 2012). Evidence
for an association between lifetime fertility and early familial
stress and menarche is mixed (Coall et al., 2016).
In terms of reducing maternal commitment, women cannot
escape the minimum obligation of gestation although under
conditions of high extrinsic risk such as famine and warfare,
mothers reduce infant-directed care (Quinlan, 2007). In low-
risk environments, offspring fitness shows a linear increase as a
function of maternal effort before reaching a saturation point of
diminishing returns. In high-risk environments (such as those
associated with a faster LH strategy) this saturation point and
the corresponding reduction in maternal care are reached much
earlier. A fast strategy prioritizes offspring quantity over qual-
ity, leading to the expectation that maternal investment will be
reduced, although not so markedly as has been found in men
(Szepsenwol, Simpson, Griskevicius, & Raby, 2015). Pregnant
women, who have a history of early life adversity, are poorly
attached and experience high levels of stress have lower oxy-
tocin levels, a hormone associated with positive mother­infant
interactions (Garfield, Mathews, & Janusek, 2016; Samuel
et al., 2015). Child neglect and abuse are associated with pov-
erty (Coulton, Crampton, Irwin, Spillsbury, & Korbin, 2007),
as are lower maternal warmth, lower positive control, and
greater negativity (Belsky, Bell, Bradley, Stallard, & Stewart-
Brown, 2007). In poor families, mothers' inability to empathize
with their children's mental states is associated with children's
heightened vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing
behaviors (Hurtig et al., 2007; Meins, Centifanti, Fernyhough,
& Fishburn, 2013).
Maternal investment in children may be truncated in favor
of a quicker return to the mating arena. Although the advan-
tages of multiple mating for women are less well-established
than for men, one clear benefit is offspring genetic diversity
8 Evolutionary Psychology
(``bet hedging'') and another may be cryptic female choice for
``good'' or compatible genes (Jennions & Petrie, 2000). As
long-term investment is not anticipated, women are expected
to show a preference for indirect benefits indexed by facial
features indicating health and dominance. Short-term relation-
ships can also supply some direct (if brief) financial benefits
and the sporadic episodes of conspicuous consumption associ-
ated with criminal enterprises (``earning-and burning'') may
make some men attractive to women. Given the laws of supply
and demand, securing the favor of such men will involve
assuming an appearance and demeanor that advertises willing-
ness to engage in a short-term relationship. Conditions of pov-
erty intensify women's intersexual and intrasexual competition
for mates (Campbell, 2013, 2015).
In addition to seeking resources through associations with
men, women living in situations of high extrinsic stress are
more vulnerable to involvement in crime although their invol-
vement is cross-culturally lower than men's. In Britain, women
are arrested for nearly 15% of detected crime (Parity, 2013)
and, as in the United States, they are disproportionately repre-
sented in petty financially motivated crimes such as fraud and
forgery (24.9%) and theft and handling (22.1%) reflecting
resource-based motivation. A high proportion of women offen-
ders are undereducated, unemployed, receiving welfare bene-
fits, and supporting dependent family members (Chesney-Lind,
1997). Traits associated with offending (including sensation
seeking, impulsivity, shortened time horizons) may be elevated
among women pursuing a faster LH strategy.
Ideally, future studies will consider the implementation of
research designs that allow us to look at many of these factors
and traits within a LH framework in more detail. Men and
women will respond to different environmental cues and (obvi-
ously) different biological events via differentially attuned psy-
chological mechanisms to facilitate fitness goals. As such,
measures and analyses that can help us look more closely at
their differences will be invaluably informative, particularly
from an interventionist or social policy perspective.
One very useful psychometric tool for exploring such differ-
ences is multigroup CFA (MGCFA; see Frazier et al., 2004). In
the MGCFA framework, sex differences in LH strategy might
manifest as configural variance (i.e., different items load on
different factors), metric variance (i.e., different loading magni-
tudes), scalar variance (i.e., different item intercepts or thresh-
olds), and/or factor level differences in parameters including
means and variances. By identifying sex differences in MGCFA
models, researchers can discover if LH factors are proxies for
different constructs (or mechanisms) between the sexes, as they
are if at least partial metric and scalar invariance do not hold. If
we are indeed measuring the same constructs across the sexes,
these models can help us determine what differences exist at the
construct level, or in terms of factor variances or means.
In sum, MGCFA can address important questions about LH
dimensions, such as (a) Does the K factor exist and have the
same meaning across the sexes? (b) Given that measurement
invariance holds, do the K factor means and variances differ
significantly between the sexes? Importantly, differences in the
means cannot be interpreted if measurement invariance does
not hold. This is because the same construct is not measured
across groups. Similar, sex differences in the correlates of the K
factor (or other LH factor) could simply reflect the fact that the
construct does not have the same identity in males and females.
If measurement invariance holds, then sex differences can be
interpreted in terms of differences in means and variances.
And, sex differences in the K factor's nomological net can be
traced to factor variance differences (with males expected to
exhibit greater variance) or otherwise explained with reference
to the evolved sex differences discussed above. At this early
stage, the dimensionality of LH indicators is not well-
established and it is not yet clear that any LH dimensions are
invariant by sex. These issues should be a focus for LH
researchers.
Item Parcels
Figueredo et al.'s critique strongly advocated the use of item
parcels when evaluating LH models. Item parcels are created
either by averaging or aggregating the scores of multiple
indices of a theoretical construct. Thus, a scale of five items
can be reduced to only one number for the purposes of analysis.
As many inventories can potentially have hundreds of items,
parceling is a pragmatic way of reducing the case-to-variable
ratio for the purposes of analysis. Further advantages have been
suggested, such as improving item fit, improving internal con-
sistency, more stable parameter estimates and reducing the
level of idiosyncratic behavior from individual items (Bandalos
& Finney, 2001; Little, Cunningham, Shahar, & Widaman,
2002; Little, Rhemtulla, Gibson, & Schoemann, 2013; Marsh,
Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998; Marsh & O'Neill, 1984;
Williams & O'Boyle, 2008; Yang, Nay, & Hoyle, 2010).
However, creating a factor via an item parcel is not the same
as examining the same factor as a manifestation of its original
indicators because the parcel is a new variable and fundamen-
tally changes the nature of the data. It is for this reason some
argue that item parceling is not an acceptable way to treat data
for the purposes of analysis (Marsh, Ludtke, Nagengast, Morin,
& Von Davier, 2013). Many researchers ignore the fact that
parceled items should be demonstrably unidimensional and
that acceptable fit should be achievable when using CFA to
model the parceled factor without cross loadings or secondary
factors (Marsh & O'Neill, 1984). The field of psychometrics
has generally accepted that if these basic assumptions are met
and have been replicated consistently, parceling in this manner
is acceptable. Unfortunately, these guidelines are not always
adhered to. Parcelled scales are often assumed to be valid and
reliable measures representing the underlying construct with-
out being tested formally via other methods (Marsh et al.,
2013). Marsh et al. provide a series of examples and simula-
tions that demonstrate how scales that do not work as concep-
tually specified can nonetheless achieve acceptable statistical
fit when parcels are used instead (including random parcels).
Often, as mentioned earlier, Cronbach's a alone is used as a
proxy to justify unidimensionality without formal testing.
Copping et al. 9
With regards to the HKSS, no such assumptions regarding
its structure could be made as no test of the underlying factor
structure had ever been conducted to examine the original the-
oretical proposal. Our analysis of the HKSS suggested that the
original specification was not unidimensional and that cross
loadings between the proposed factors were evident. Treating
the originally suggested subscales independently was equally
problematic. The revision of the original items creates a better
model with four factors that did not cross load at item level
(although the resulting factors are not independent). Given this,
what justification would there have been to parcel the HKSS in
the manner Figueredo et al. suggested? Had this been done, the
problems inherent in the measure would have been effectively
hidden from view and thus we would have created a measure
with a presumably near perfect fit with only four items. Mis-
specification would have been masked by the creation of four
new variables. What would this new scale mean? Would it
accurately reflect responses to items? Would the relationships
between factors now be meaningful? This all seems unlikely.
When interpreting models, it is important to consider what
they actually represent. Can a model using parcels (including
nonrandom parcels) really reflect anything conceptually rele-
vant? The concept underlying the measure must be kept in
mind during model construction in CFA. If not, what is being
confirmed? The decision in our study to treat the models by
specifying the underlying structure in full (rather than by par-
celing) was the correct way to treat these data, particularly in
the absence of historic evidence that the proposed structure was
acceptable to begin with. Considering that our sample size was
large enough to evaluate the full scale on an item level, what
reason would there be to reduce this model down to three or
four parcels? To parcel the items post hoc as suggested by our
critics would achieve statistical parsimony at the expense of
validity. This would not advance our understanding of LH
strategies. The structural analysis we employed helped to
develop a scale that could reconcile theory with the available
data set. Had the model not been specified in full, it would have
been impossible to perform detailed examination of specific
items to determine which were problematic for the scale.
Summary
While accepting many of the comments made by Figueredo
et al., we feel our original work was far from ``psychometri-
cally invalid'' and reiterate calls for further consideration to be
given to actual life events and for greater synthesis of these
with psychological variables deemed important to the LH stra-
tegies. In doing so, researchers should be able to determine if
the nomological net as described by Rushton (1985), Figueredo
et al. (2015), and others exists in a form that can be reduced to
an aggregated factor score. Furthermore, we urge researchers to
pay more attention to the constituent latent traits on higher
order factors prior to aggregation and to publish more data
regarding their structure. Ensuring that the lower order traits
are valid structural measures of relevant LH traits before aggre-
gating them into higher order factors and/or using parceled
measures will afford greater confidence in the interpretation
of results. Invariance testing across groups will also allow us
to more adequately generalize findings across different popula-
tions including culture, class, and sex. The validity of K-based
measures in relation to adaptively relevant behaviors must be
considered in greater detail if further substantial progress is to
be made in the field.
