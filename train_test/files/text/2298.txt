Abstract: This article examines the pattern of interactions between education, occupation, personal
economic expectations and feelings of national identity and how these interactions affect public
support for the EU. Using Eurobarometer data from 1993 to 2006, the results in this paper
demonstrate that occupation mediates the relationship between EU support and education. It is also
found that the sway of citizens' personal financial expectations on EU support is not conditioned by
education and occupation. Finally citizens' personal economic expectations are not found to
condition the relationship between EU support and feelings of national identity. In the light of these
findings the paper draws implications.

Introduction
The significant increase in power of the EU in the last two decades has made the EU more
of a point of reference for citizens living in the member states. With this increase, academic
interest in the public's views on European integration has grown. Previous research has
established that utilitarianism and identity-related factors play a role in determining public
attitudes to European integration (for example, Gabel, 1998; Carey, 2002 and Hooghe and
Marks, 2005). Some scholars have sought to find out which of the utilitarian self-interest
and identity-based approaches is more important in swaying public support for the EU (for
example, Hooghe and Marks, 2004). Others have started to investigate the relationship
between these two perspectives and more specifically whether utilitarianism can arbitrate
the effect of national identity on public attitudes to the EU (De Vries and Van Kersbergen,
2007 and Garry and Tilley, 2009). These studies have however provided us with a limited
snapshot of the conditional nature of determinants of public attitudes to the EU. I wish
here to elaborate on the relationship between the two approaches but also on how each
element of the utilitarian theory ­ that is to say education, occupation and future expecta-
tions about the financial situation of the household ­ impacts on each other to affect public
attitudes towards European integration.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and scope of the interactions between
utilitarian-based elements and the relationship of utilitarianism with national identity as a
driver of citizens' EU support in the post-Maastricht era. This paper expands the public

opinion literature on European integration by testing, cross-nationally and cross-tempo-
rally, the mediating role of utilitarian explanations on the relationship between national
identity and EU support. It also contributes to public opinion literature on European inte-
gration by analysing whether citizens' occupations, education and perceptions of their per-
sonal economic conditions interact with one another to sway public support for the EU.
This article is structured as follows. Firstly, it starts with a discussion of previous research
on public attitudes towards the EU, including expositions of the utilitarian and identity-
based theories. Secondly, it sets out four hypotheses, which are tested on the basis of Euro-
barometer datasets for twelve EU countries during the period from 1993 to 2006. Thirdly,
the findings are discussed and implications are drawn.
Utilitarianism and EU support
Citizens' priorities are of two types: concerns about economic and physical security (materi-
alist values) and concerns about human rights, the environment and quality of life issues
(post materialist values). Economic prosperity and peace, after the Second World War, have
superseded citizens' class-based materialist values with post-material values such as environ-
mentalism, women's and minorities' rights, democratic participation and nuclear disarma-
ment (Inglehart, 1977a). Because younger age cohorts ­ also better educated and more
highly paid individuals ­ are more post-material, Inglehart (1977b) proposed that support
for European integration should be higher in younger groups. More recent studies have
however reported that age has no effect and post-materialistic values no or little effect on
evaluations of EU membership (Anderson and Reichert, 1996 and Gabel, 1998).
The approval of materialism as an element of support for European integration orien-
tated researchers to explore the utilitarian perspective. According to this perspective, citi-
zens evaluate the integration process (with its economic, social and political consequences)
in terms of its costs and benefits, nationally and individually. Previous research has demon-
strated that citizens' positive perceptions of national and personal economic conditions
increased the level of support for EU integration (see for example, Carey, 2002; Llamazares
and Gramacho, 2007; Hooghe and Marks, 2005 and De Vreese and Boomgaarden, 2005).
It was also found that people with human and financial capital ­ higher incomes, better
education and higher (more marketable) occupational skills ­ are more supportive of inte-
gration as the market liberalization pertaining to EU integration offers more opportunities
for them (Gabel, 1998; Hooghe and Marks, 2005 and Hooghe, Huo and Marks, 2007).
Research to date has not however tested whether citizens' occupations, education and per-
ceptions of their personal economic conditions interact with one another to sway public
support for the EU. Examining the nature of these relationships is nevertheless particularly
important as it can help to determine the leading utilitarian factors of support for integra-
tion. This will be tested in the present analysis. It is contended that the impact of education
on EU support is mediated by occupation (Hypothesis HI
). I expect that EU citizens in
higher occupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in
lower occupations with a higher education. Higher occupational skills are generally valued
more than a higher education in the job market. Having had a higher education is also
likely to be more important to those in higher occupations than those in lower occupations
in the same (see for example, Carnevale, Rose and Cheah, 2011). I theorize that market lib-
eralisation relating to integration offers more opportunities for those in higher occupations
(even with a lower education) than those in lower occupations with a higher education. If
market liberalisation can intensify job insecurity for both groups of citizens via the shifting

of production across borders, occupational welfare and mobility is likely to be more diffi-
cult for citizens in lower occupations with a higher education.
It is also argued that the impact of future personal financial expectations on EU support
is conditioned by education and occupation (Hypotheses HII
and HIII
). I expect that EU
nationals who have positive future expectations about their personal financial situation irre-
spective of whether they have a lower education, support the EU more than those with nega-
tive expectations and a higher education. It is argued here that the personal economic
optimism will cancel out any hypothetical economic reservation about European integration
and more specifically its associated job insecurity. The same reasoning applies to individuals
in lower occupations. It is therefore maintained that EU nationals in lower occupations who
have positive future expectations about their personal financial situation are more likely to
back EU integration than those with negative expectations and in higher occupations.
Influence of National Identity on Support for the European Union
The national identity theory also explains public support for European integration. The
national political, economic, historical and cultural contexts influence the development of
citizen attitudes towards the EU (Angelucci, 1993 and Kritzinger, 2003). In the last two
decades, the greater sway of the European Union in the economic, political and cultural
matters of each member state ­ previously under the sole responsibility of the nation-
state ­ encroaches on the attachment that an individual feels towards the nation. The more
exclusive the attachment, the less likely it is that the individual will endorse measures that
reduce national influence over economics and politics. The loss of national sovereignty is
key here and pertains to developments towards for instance, a common foreign and defence
policy, a European currency, or the increased primacy of European law. Eurosceptic politi-
cal parties and party factions in EU member states1 partly articulate their opposition to
European integration on the basis that it threatens national identity and sovereignty. Vari-
ous studies have demonstrated the relationship between the importance of exclusive
national identity and lack of support for European integration (Kaltenthaler and Anderson,
2001; Luedtke, 2005 and McLaren, 2007). Some research has even found that identity issues
are a better predictor of EU dissent than economic considerations (Hooghe and Marks,
2004; Citrin and Sides, 2004 and Kriesi et al., 2006). A significant weakness of these studies
is that they only relied on data from one year or data which do not encompass the 21st
century period.
Previous research has explored the possibility that the benefits that individuals can obtain
from European integration can arbitrate the relationship between national identity matters
and public support for the EU. Net EU budgetary transfers, economic development and
economic pessimism were thus found to condition the impact of national identity on public
attitudes towards the EU (De Vries and Van Kersbergen, 2007 and Garry and Tilley, 2009).
The results of these studies are though only based on data from one year. This restricts their
scope and the validity of these results across time remains questionable.
Our focus here is on microeconomic considerations. It is contended that the impact of
national identity on EU support is mediated by economic pessimism/optimism (Hypothesis
1 Examples are political parties such as Lega Nord in Italy, and factions within the Labour Party and the Conser-
vative Party (from 1997, the leadership of the Conservative Party adopted though a more eurosceptic stance) and
political parties in the political periphery such as UKIP and BNP in the United Kingdom. For a discussion on
euroscepticism in party politics in EU nations, see for example, Szcerbiak and Taggart, 2008.

). I expect that EU citizens with an inclusive national identity who have negative future
expectations about their personal financial situation are more supportive of the EU than
those with an exclusive national identity who have positive expectations. Individuals
develop intense group loyalties long before they develop rational faculties. The premise of
social identity theory is that ``who one is'' depends on which groups one identifies with.
This brings a group loyalty which can be extremely powerful in shaping views towards
political objects (Massey, 2002; Sears, 1993 and Sniderman, Hagendoorn and Prior, 2004).
The strongest territorial identities are national and such identities can affect public prefer-
ences towards European integration. An individual harbouring an exclusive (or inclusive)
national identity will show a particularly strong affective attachment towards the nation (or
towards the nation and the EU) which is likely to show some resistance to positive (or nega-
tive) economic rationality. This resistance is unlikely to be fully offset by economic opti-
mism (or pessimism) and still retains a leading role in influencing public preferences
towards the EU.
Methodology
The hypotheses aim to study the pattern of interactions between utilitarian-related elements
and how these affect public EU support. How utilitarianism conditions the effect of
national identity on public attitudes to the EU is also examined during the period from
1993 to 2006. The study is done at the individual level and based on twelve nations includ-
ing the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Ireland, Greece and Denmark.2 The Eurobarometer data surveys used for
the statistical analyses are the following: EB 65.2, EB 63.4, EB 62.0, EB 60.1, EB 58.1, EB
56.2, EB 54.1, EB 52.0, EB 42.0 and EB 40. The availability of required questions to test
the hypotheses in the period of study justifies this data selection. The primary goal in build-
ing the regression models was to examine the unique effects of independent variables on the
dependent variable, with maximising the explained variance in the regression analyses com-
ing only as a secondary goal. National weights are used to make the national samples more
representative of the total populations.
Beside the fact that it coincided with major developments in the EU integration process,
the 1993­2006 period was selected because fourteen years is an adequate period for ascer-
taining the effects of perceived and actual personal economic and social conditions on pub-
lic opinion concerning integration, but also for taking account of the nature and direction
of changes in the EU which affected people's lives. The fourteen-year period is adequate to
carry out time-series analysis.
Selection and operationalization of variables
The dependent variable used to test EU support is the following:
``Taking everything into consideration, would you say that (OUR COUNTRY) has on balance
benefited or not from being a member of the European Union?''
Answer coded 0 for don't know and not benefited and answer coded 1 for benefited
The rationale for selecting the EU benefit dependent variable and retaining ``don't know''
responses in the benefit question is as follows. This variable gauges utilitarian support
2 These countries were EU members throughout the study period.

(recognised as such by previous research literature) and is available across years. The selec-
tion of a measure of utilitarian support is justified by the research focus on investigating the
pattern of interactions between utilitarian-related elements. The retention of ``don't know''
responses in the benefit question is justified by the fact that it can help to capture the opin-
ion of people who feel their country has neither benefited nor not benefited from EU mem-
bership ­ and not only those who have no opinion on the issue ­ in the absence of such an
option in the response categories proposed to respondents. The fact that ``don't know''
responses represented around 19% of responses in the EU benefit question ­ against 6% of
answers in the good thing question ­ seems to substantiate this. The EU benefit question is
a relatively more precise question than the EU membership3 question. This may accentuate
the stress on utilitarian feelings for individuals. Anderson and Smith (2004) thus found that
citizens tend to be even more critical of European integration when responding to the EU
benefit question.
The coding of the dependent variable ­ that is to say the regrouping of the middle cate-
gory with ``not benefited'' responses ­ is motivated not only on statistical grounds4 but also
by the fact that hypotheses primarily aim to analyse whether individual utilitarian and iden-
tity reasons explain or not people's support for the EU. ``Don't know'' answers in the bene-
fit question were also found to express lack of support for the EU (Anderson and Smith,
2004). The four models presented here were also tested without ``don't know'' responses in
the dependent variable and similar results were obtained.
As far as independent variables are concerned, subjective personal financial situation
evaluation, education, occupation and national identity are used to test the hypotheses.
Subjective Personal Financial Situation Evaluation ­ The following question was used to op-
erationalize this variable: ``What are your expectations for the year to come, will (next year)
be better, the same or worse, when it comes to the financial situation of your household?''
The justification for selecting citizens' subjective personal financial situation evaluation
over the next twelve months (rather than just in the past twelve months) is that respondents
tend to form their opinion about their personal situation on the present situation and the
near future rather than just on the recent past. This question is also useful as it enables the
respondent to compare the current year with next year's expectations. Furthermore this
variable was available largely across years in the study period, which was not the case for
the other type of variables.
Education ­ Question D8 ``How old were you when you stopped full-time education?'' has
been employed to operationalise the education variable. It incorporates the following
groups: ``up to 15 years old'', ``16­19 years old'' and ``20+ years old''.
Occupation ­ Question D15a was operationalised as follows. The variable compared middle
and high managers and professionals (inclusive of employed ones) together (coded 1) versus
the rest (shop owners, farmers/fishermen, manual workers, clerks, unemployed, retired or
unable to work through illness and housewives) (coded 2). The justification for this is that
3 The EU membership question is as follows: ``Generally speaking, do you think that (OUR COUNTRY)'s mem-
bership of the European Union is a good thing, a bad thing or neither good nor bad?'' The four models presented
here were also tested with the EU membership dependent variable and similar results were obtained.
4 That is to say, to avoid the problem of empty cells or inadequate expected cell frequencies which would weaken
the logistic regression statistical analysis.

the category coded 1 are expected to support EU integration as market liberalization per-
taining to European integration offers more opportunities for people with human and
financial capital. The income variable was not available after 2003 and was therefore not
retained in the present analysis. Nonetheless, the occupation variable partly overlaps with
the income variable and also relates to some extent to the financial situation of citizens ­
there is a medium correlation between income and occupation (r = .333).
Exclusive National Identity ­ Recoded from Eurobarometer question: ``In the near future,
do you see yourself as (1) nationality only, (2) nationality and European, (3) European and
nationality, and (4) European only?'' The value of one was given to respondents with exclu-
sive national identity (nationality only) and zero for all other categories. This question was
selected as it is about community and identity (in line with literature) and is available across
years.
In line with earlier research on public opinion about the EU, the following variables are
control variables: EU Knowledge, Political Ideology, Age, Gender, Subjective National
Economic Performance Evaluation, Incumbent Government Support, Referendum years
and European Election Years (see Appendix A for the operationalisation of these vari-
ables).
Selection of statistical tests
To test the hypotheses, cross-sectional individual-level data from 1993 to 2006 were pooled.
As individual-level data are used, time series problems (that is to say autocorrelation) of
pooled models of panel data are not applicable to the present statistical design, which pools
a series of independent cross-sections (Beck and Katz, 1995). Regression model residual
means for each year and nation were examined so as to neutralise any potential time- or
nation-specific effects (fixed effects) which would bias parameter estimates.5 The use of
logistic regression as the statistical tool for the analysis of EU benefit is determined by the
dichotomous nature of the dependent variable used. The sample size was adequate to satisfy
the objectives of the present analysis (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001). Models respected all
regression assumptions.
Results and Analysis
The regression constant is (statistically) significant in all models (see Table 1). The direction
of the constant coefficient suggests that overall there is a significant drop in EU support in
the study period (1993­2006). Figure 1 confirms this. The coefficients for subjective per-
sonal financial situation evaluation, education and national identity are (statistically) signifi-
cant and are in the expected direction. The coefficient for occupation is nevertheless not
significant and shows no influence on EU support. By and large, these results tend to con-
firm the results of for example, Carey (2002) and McLaren (2007) that individuals with
human and financial capital, with positive personal economic expectations or with an inclu-
sive national identity are more supportive of the EU. Our findings also corroborate the
results of Hooghe and Marks (2004) and Citrin and Sides (2004) that exclusive national
identity explains more citizens' opposition to the EU than economic utilitarianism. How

and years.

each component of the utilitarian theory interacts with one another to shape public opinion
on integration and how utilitarianism mediates the relationship between national identity
and EU support will now be examined.
Testing of hypotheses
For each interaction term, constitutive terms6 are all included in the model specification as
recommended by Brambor, Clark and Golder (2006). The coefficient for the interaction var-
iable between occupation and education is (statistically) significant but is not in the
expected direction (see Table 1, Model 1). The results on the two-way interaction effects
cannot though be interpreted as unconditional marginal effects as they only capture the
effect of education on EU support when the conditioning variable value (occupation) is zero
(Brambor et al. 2006). To remedy this situation and therefore gauge accurately the nature
of the marginal effects, we have plotted the significant two-way interaction effects.
In view of the difference in line slopes in Figure 2, hypothesis HI
is supported. Therefore
occupation mediates the relationship between EU support and education. Citizens in
higher occupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in
lower occupations with a higher education. Figure 2 also shows that individuals in lower
occupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in lower
occupations with a higher education. It reveals that citizens in higher occupations with a
higher education are only marginally more supportive of the EU than those in higher occu-
pations with a lower education. These results indicate that occupational skills are likely to
be considered by EU nationals to some extent as a buffer against job insecurity associated

with European market liberalisation. Job-related skills may be seen by citizens as facilitating
labour mobility within the EU but also more generally as helping them to withstand in some
measure the greater job competition that market liberalisation has entailed. Individuals in
lower occupations with a higher education are however generally dissatisfied with their job
(see for example, Robst, 2008 and Chevalier, 2003) and may partly hold the process of
market liberalisation relating to integration responsible for this. Citizens in lower occupa-
tions with a lower education are less likely to be dissatisfied with their job and are therefore
likely to be less reticent towards integration. Their lower education can also denote a lack
of knowledge about the EU which can neutralise any potential negative opinions about
integration.
The coefficients for the interaction variable between education and personal economic
expectations and between occupation and personal economic expectations are not (statisti-
cally) significant (see Table 1, Models 2 and 3). The related coefficients are though in the
expected direction. In view of the non- (statistical) significance of the coefficients for these
interaction variables, hypotheses HII
and HIII
are not supported. Therefore the impact of
future personal financial expectations on EU support is not conditioned by education or
occupation. Citizens with a lower education (or in lower occupations) who have better
expectations about the financial situation of their household in the next twelve months are
not more supportive of integration than those with a higher education (or in higher
occupations) who have worse expectations. Citizens' future personal financial expectations
influence EU support regardless of education and occupation.
The coefficient for the interaction variable between national identity and personal eco-
nomic expectations is not (statistically) significant (see Table 1, Model 4). The related coeffi-
cient is nevertheless in the expected direction. Given the non- (statistical) significance of the
coefficient for this interaction variable, hypothesis HIV
is not supported. Therefore the
impact of national identity on EU support is not mediated by personal economic pessi-
mism/optimism. This may be so as an individual does not let personal economic expecta-
tions (especially short-term, transient expectations) impinge on his/her affective link
towards the nation (or towards the nation and the EU ­ inclusive national identity). The
citizen's emotional connection towards the nation (or towards the nation and the EU) is
deep-rooted and durable. Previous research (see for example, Schild and Hessel, 2010;
Gramacho and llamazares, 2005) has moreover found that socio-tropic utility calculations
about the EU were found to explain opinions on the EU more powerfully than personal
utility calculations. This result is also a further confirmation that exclusive or inclusive
national identity is a more important contributor to the explanation of EU support than
economic utilitarianism.
Conclusion
The results of this analysis expand the public opinion literature on European integration by
showing how individuals' education and occupation interact with one another to influence
public attitudes towards the EU. More specifically, the findings in this paper demonstrate
that occupation arbitrates the relationship between education and EU support. Occupational
skills somewhat emerge as a more important vector of support for the EU than a higher
education as the former are likely to be considered by EU citizens as a relatively stronger
defence against the greater job uncertainty associated with European market liberalisation.
Education and occupation are not found to arbitrate the relationship between short-term
personal financial expectations and EU support. Citizens' short-term personal economic

optimism (or pessimism) therefore influence EU support irrespective of occupational and
educational differences. Individuals' short-term personal economic expectations are also not
found to condition the relationship between EU support and feelings of national identity.
In other words, these expectations do not alter the relationship between citizens' feelings of
national identity and EU support. Citizens' affective attachment towards the nation (or
towards the nation and the EU) is therefore proving particularly entrenched and enduring.
The political implications of this research are that EU and national policy-makers should
further pursue policies that aim to continually raise the educational but even more
importantly occupational profile of citizens. These policies are likely to help citizens combat
the perceived job insecurity pertaining to European market liberalisation and take advan-
tage of the opportunities arising as a result of it. The continued viability of these policies is
though dependent on the presence of opportunities stemming from a positive economic cli-
mate. EU and national policy-makers have a role to play in trying to stimulate citizens'
positive financial expectations as these are likely to have a positive effect on EU support
regardless of occupational and educational differences.
Another political implication is that citizens' personal economic optimism is ineffective to
reverse the negative impact of citizens' feelings of exclusive national identity on EU sup-
port. It is therefore important that national and EU policy-makers work towards flexible
modes of integration7 that ensure a greater compatibility between national identities and a
European identity and thus give some satisfaction to as many national publics as possible.
It is also about fostering a European identity that is not portrayed as threatening national
identities and capitalise on what is common to all national identities. The denial of the
Christian heritage in the European constitution and the potential entry of Turkey in the
EU may be in this respect particularly damaging to the popularity of the EU among
national publics.
The denial of the Christian heritage in the European constitution may well be perceived
by citizens as a threat to their national identity, not only in countries where Christianism is
recognised as the religion of the state but also in other EU nations.8 The potential entry of
Turkey in the EU is also generating significant concerns among national publics as Turkey
is considered as an identity threat as well as a threat to the economy and society of member
states and the EU (Eurobarometer 66, Autunm 2006). In view of the growing unpopularity
of the EU, can national and EU decision-makers really afford to ignore these significant
popular concerns?

8 The Christian heritage is an element which is common to all EU member states, irrespective of differences
between member states in the proportion of the population going to Church regularly. The latest decision of the
European commission to circulate an EU calendar destined to schools in the EU mentioning all religious celebra-
tions except Christian festivities appears particularly ill judged and has proved particularly unpopular (Waterfield,

Appendix
EU Knowledge ­ The following question was used: ``....how much do you feel you know
about the European Union, its policies, its institutions?'' answers were coded as 1 for
respondents who know it very and quite well, and coded as 2 for respondents who know it
not very well and not at all. This variable measures subjective knowledge. Measures of
objective knowledge were not available every year and consisted of different knowledge
questions (varying in difficulty from one Eurobarometer survey to another) which made it
somewhat less reliable to infer and compare knowledge of respondents across years. The
effect of subjective and objective knowledge on the dependent variable was nevertheless
very similar.
Political Ideology ­ Ideological views of respondents with left, centre and right categories.
Age ­ With 15­24, 25­39, 40­54 and 55+ years old groupings.
Gender ­ Female and male categories
Subjective National Economic Performance Evaluation ­ The following question was used to
operationalize the two variables below: ``What are your expectations for the year to come,
will (next year) be better, the same or worse, when it comes to ...?''
Expectations over coming 12 months for Economic Situation in Country
Expectations over coming 12 months for Employment Situation in Country
Incumbent Government Support ­ The following question was used: ``if there was a General
Election tomorrow, which party would you vote for?'' answers were coded as 1 for support-
ers of the government (governing parties), 2 for don't know and 3 for supporters of non-
governing parties.
