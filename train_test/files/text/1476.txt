Context: Lead is a ubiquitous neurotoxicant, and ad-
verse cognitive and behavioral effects are well-
documented in children and occupationally exposed
adults but not in adults with low environmental expo-
sure.
Objective: To investigate the association of current blood
lead levels with 3 common psychiatric disorders--
major depression, panic, and generalized anxiety--in
young adults.
Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic survey.
Setting: Nationally representative sample of US adults.
Participants: A total of 1987 adults aged 20 to 39 years
who responded to the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (1999-2004).
Main Outcome Measures: Twelve-month DSM-IV cri-
teria­based diagnoses of major depressive disorder, panic
disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder assessed using
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Results: The mean (SD) blood lead level was 1.61 (1.72)
µg/dL (range, 0.3-37.3 µg/dL) (to convert to micro-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0483). Increasing blood lead
levels were associated with higher odds of major depres-
sion (P=.05 for trend) and panic disorder (P=.02 for
trend) but not generalized anxiety disorder (P=.78 for
trend) after adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation status, and poverty to income ratio. Persons with
blood lead levels in the highest quintile had 2.3 times the
odds of major depressive disorder (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 1.13-4.75) and 4.9 times the odds of panic
disorder (1.32-18.48) as those in the lowest quintile. Ciga-
rette smoking was associated with higher blood lead lev-
els and outcome, but models that excluded current smok-
ers also resulted in significantly increased odds of major
depression (P=.03 for trend) and panic disorder (P=.01
for trend) with higher blood lead quintiles.
Conclusions: In these young adults with low levels of
lead exposure, higher blood lead levels were associated
with increased odds of major depression and panic dis-
orders. Exposure to lead at levels generally considered
safe could result in adverse mental health outcomes.

LEAD IS A WELL-KNOWN NEU-
rotoxicant that is ubiquitous
in the environment, found in
air, soil, dust, and water.
Bloodleadlevelsmeasuredin
the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) have been a cor-
nerstoneofleadexposuresurveillanceinthe
United States since the early 1970s.1 Data
show a dramatic decline in average blood
lead levels since 19802 due, in large part, to
the removal of lead from gasoline. How-
ever, several sources of exposure remain,
such as paint, industrial processes, water
contaminated by corroding pipes or sol-
der,mining,pottery,andfolkmedicine.Ad-
verse effects of lead exposure have been re-
ported for different organ systems, most
notablythenervoussystem3 butalsothecar-
diovascular4,5 and renal6 systems.
Research on the neurotoxic effects of
low-level lead exposure has focused on the
in utero and early childhood periods.7 In
adult populations, the neurotoxic effects
of lead have been studied mainly in the
context of occupational exposures, with
levels of exposure orders of magnitude
greater than that experienced by the gen-
eral population. Lead-exposed workers in
foundries, battery plants, and lead smelt-
ers were reported to experience cognitive
and neuromotor deficits as well as mood
disorders such as anxiety, hostility, and de-
pressive states.8-13 Almost all of the par-
ticipants in these investigations were men,
with mean blood lead levels as high as 40
µg/dL (to convert to micromoles per li-
ter, multiply by 0.0483).

vous system effects of lead exposure at the

low levels commonly encountered in the general adult
population. Between 1999 and 2002, the geometric mean
blood lead level in 20- to 59-year-old adults living in the
United States was 1.5 µg/dL.14 The results of one study15
in the general adult population suggest that lead expo-
sure might adversely affect emotional regulation. Higher
blood and bone lead levels in 526 men living in or near
Boston were associated with a higher degree of anxiety,
phobic anxiety, and depression on a symptom question-
naire after adjusting for covariates.15 The association be-
tween lead exposure and adverse neuropsychiatric symp-
toms was greater in -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
(ALAD) 1-1 carriers than in 1-2/2-2 carriers, suggesting
possible effect modification by genotype.16 The mean
blood lead level in this sample of older men (mean age,
63 years) was 6.3 µg/dL, and the assessment of psychi-
atric symptoms relied on self-reported symptoms rather
than on psychiatric disorders defined by standard diag-
nostic criteria.
Depression and anxiety disorders are common forms
of psychiatric disorder in the general adult population,
causing substantial morbidity. Most research on envi-
ronmental risk factors has focused on the social envi-
ronment. Exposures to environmental contaminants with
neurotoxic properties, however, could also be impor-
tant risk factors. The objective of the present study is to
assess the possible role of exposure to lead in adverse men-
tal health outcomes in a more broadly distributed and
younger population. We used data from the NHANES for
1999 to 2004 to investigate the relation between blood
lead levels and the odds of major depressive disorder
(MDD), panic disorder (PD), and generalized anxiety dis-
order (GAD) in a sample representative of the US popu-
lation aged 20 to 39 years.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
AND POPULATION
The NHANES is a population-based health survey of nonin-
stitutionalized US residents conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention. The NHANES uses a complex, multistage probability
sampling design, with oversampling of adolescents 12 to 19 years
of age, adults 60 years and older, low-income persons, Mexi-
can American individuals, and non-Hispanic black individu-
als. All the participants completed household surveys con-
ducted by trained study staff that included questions about
demographics and health history. The study protocol also in-
cluded standardized medical examinations at mobile centers
thatincludedaprivateinterviewandcollectionofabloodsample.
The study protocol is described in detail elsewhere.1
The World Health Organization Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview (CIDI)17 was administered to a random sub-
sample of the participants composed of 50% of those aged 20
to 39 years. The CIDI was administered in English or Spanish.
All the interviews were conducted directly with the respon-
dents during a private session; persons who required proxies
were ineligible (ie, non-English and non-Spanish speakers). This
study includes the 1987 individuals who had available data on
CIDI diagnoses of MDD, PD, or GAD; blood lead levels; and
all of the covariates.
MEASURES
Psychiatric Outcomes
The CIDI is a fully structured diagnostic interview used to as-
sess psychiatric disorders following criteria defined in DSM-
IV.18 Three diagnostic modules were administered: MDD, PD,
and GAD. The CIDI questions address DSM-IV criteria for each
of the 3 disorders, and a diagnosis is established based on the
answers. Only disorders present during the previous 12 months
were identified in this survey.
Major depressive disorder is defined as 1 or more major de-
pressive episodes characterized by at least 2 weeks of depressed
mood or loss of interest, accompanied by at least 4 of the follow-
ing additional symptoms of depression: significant appetite or
weight change, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agita-
tion or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, diminished ability
to think or concentrate or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts
of death or planning, or attempts. The symptoms must cause sig-
nificant distress or impairment and are not the result of bereave-
ment. Panic disorder is defined by intense periods of fear or dis-
comfort, that is, panic attacks that are recurrent and occur
unexpectedly. A panic attack is identified when at least 4 of the
following symptoms are present: heart racing, sweating, shak-
ing, shortness of breath, feeling choked, chest pain, nausea, diz-
ziness, feeling unreal/situation is unreal, afraid to lose control,
hot flashes, and numbness. A positive diagnosis is established if
4 or more panic attacks occurred and if at least 1 attack caused
concern,worry,orbehaviorchangeduring1monthormore.Gen-
eralizedanxietydisorderisdefinedbyexcessiveanxietyandworry
that is difficult to control, with at least 3 of the following symp-
toms of anxiety present: unusual fatigue, trouble sleeping, trouble
concentrating, irritability, and feeling tense, sore, or muscles ach-
ing. The anxiety must cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment. For all 3 disorders, symptoms must not be caused by
the direct physiologic effects of a substance or another medical
condition.
Participants completed the CIDI during a private interview
with trained interviewers. An automated version of the CIDI
(version 2.1) was used to facilitate the interview process and
data management.17 The CIDI addresses the symptoms listed
in the previous paragraph, the context in which they occurred
and the exterior factors possibly explaining them, and the dis-
tress associated with them to establish the diagnoses based on
DSM-IV criteria. The CIDI responses are evaluated using a com-
puter algorithm that assesses each criterion, and criteria are com-
bined into diagnoses. The diagnoses are designated as part of
NHANES data processing, and the dichotomous diagnosis vari-
ables--that is, yes or no for a diagnosis in the previous 12
months--were in the NHANES downloaded data sets. These
variables are the outcomes in the present study.
The CIDI has been widely used in research and population
surveys.19-21 It can be administered by lay interviewers with ex-
cellent reliability, it does not require outside informants or medi-
cal records, and it does not assume the presence of a current
disorder.17 In a validity study,22 CIDI diagnoses were com-
pared with diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview
(SCID) for DSM-IV, and a high level of concordance was ob-
served. Specifically, 84% of cases of anxiety disorder and 70%
of cases of mood disorder identified in the clinical interview
were also identified using the CIDI. The CIDI lifetime preva-
lence estimates were generally lower than the SCID estimates.
The concordance between the SCID and the CIDI is likely to
be constrained because the SCID itself has only moderate re-
liability. Also, the difference in the mode of administration, that
is, telephone interview for the SCID and in-person interview
for the CIDI, could contribute to discordant diagnoses.

Blood Lead Levels
Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped
to the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for En-
vironmental Health, and to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for analysis. Vials were stored at -20°C until they
were shipped. For samples collected in 1999 to 2002, the blood
lead concentration was determined by means of graphite fur-
nace atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and the limit of de-
tection was 0.3 µg/dL.23,24 For samples collected in 2003 and
2004, the whole blood lead concentration was determined by
means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and
the limit of detection was 0.2 µg/L. The NHANES quality as-
surance and quality control protocols meet the 1988 Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act mandates.25
Other Variables
We included the following variables in the analyses because of
their known associations with lead exposure, mental health sta-
tus, or both: sex, age, race/ethnicity, education status, and pov-
erty to income ratio (PIR). Non-Hispanic black persons have
higher rates of depression than do non-Hispanic white per-
sons.26 Women have higher rates of depressive and anxiety dis-
orders,21 as do individuals with less education.27 The preva-
lence of several disorders is higher in those with lower
socioeconomic status,21 which herein was assessed using the
PIR, a parameter that compares self-reported family income with
the US Census­based poverty threshold value for each calen-
dar year adjusted for inflation and the age of the family refer-
ence person. The PIR was coded into 4 categories to reflect the
current standards used in government-financed welfare pro-
grams (the lowest category, 1.0, corresponds to the poorest
group). Finally, smoking is strongly associated with depres-
sion and anxiety disorders.28 Past and current use of tobacco
products was assessed by means of questionnaire, and serum
cotinine levels were measured to further identify active smok-
ers (based on the 10-ng/mL cutoff value commonly used).29 Six
hundred twenty-eight persons were considered current smok-
ers: 526 based on questionnaire responses and an additional
102 based on serum cotinine levels. Lead exposure also differs
with respect to sex (higher in men), race/ethnicity (higher in
black persons), education status (higher with lower educa-
tional attainment), socioeconomic status (higher in lower so-
cioeconomic strata), and smoking (higher in smokers).30,31
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We used the Complex Samples module of SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Illinois) to obtain effect estimates and their confi-
dence intervals (CIs), accounting for the multistage probabil-
ity sampling design of the NHANES. The NHANES provides
sample weights to generate population prevalence estimates,
adjusting for the oversampling of certain population sub-
groups and accounting for nonresponse and noncoverage.32 For
estimates of outcome prevalences and odds ratios (ORs), we
used the special examination sample weights for the sub-
sample eligible to be administered the CIDI, computing 6-year
weights (1999-2004) using the method recommended by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.32
To reduce the effect of extreme values on these analyses,
we analyzed blood lead levels in quintiles (first [lowest]: 0.7
µg/dL; second: 0.71-1.0 µg/dL; third: 1.01-1.4 µg/dL; fourth:
1.41-2.1 µg/dL; and fifth [highest]: 2.11 µg/dL). Thirty-
three participants (1.7%) had blood lead levels lower than the
limits of detection. We fit multivariable-adjusted logistic re-
gression models to estimate the prevalence ORs and 95% CIs
of MDD, PD, and GAD across increasing blood lead level quin-
tiles relative to the lowest quintile (ie, the referent). To assess
the linear trend in these associations, we fit models using a term
created by assigning to each individual the median value of his
or her blood lead quintile. All models were adjusted for sex,
age (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, and
other race or multiracial), education status (less than high school,
high school diploma, and more than high school), and PIR
(1.0, 1.0-1.84, 1.85-3.0, and 3.0). As an alternative mod-
eling strategy, we also fit logistic regression models using log10
-
transformed blood lead values. The presence of a possible time
trend was assessed by adding a dummy variable for the wave
of data collection years (1=1999-2000, 2=2001-2002, and
3=2003-2004) in the models. Finally, we also used subpopu-
lation analyses to obtain results stratified by sex. We used P.05
as the level of statistical significance.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics are given in Table 1. The study
population included more women than men, but, once
weighted, the observations accounted for an equal rep-
resentation of men and women. The age distribution was
fairly uniform and ranged from 20 to 39 years. The num-
bers of persons meeting the 12-month DSM-IV criteria
were 134 (6.7%) for MDD, 44 for PD (2.2%), and 47
(2.4%) for GAD (Table 2). The corresponding popu-
lation prevalence estimates, determined after applying the
sample weights, were 7.8%, 2.6%, and 3.0%. There were
no significant differences in blood lead levels, age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, PIR, or smoking between those
to whom the CIDI was administered and those to whom
it was not (P.1).
The geometric mean (SD) blood lead level was 1.24
(1.96) µg/dL. The arithmetic mean (SD) blood lead level
was 1.61 (1.72) µg/dL, and values ranged from 0.3 to 37.3
µg/dL; 13 values (0.7%) exceeded 10 µg/dL, and 4 val-
ues (0.2%) exceeded 15 µg/dL. In multivariable-
adjusted analyses, significantly higher blood lead levels
were observed with the following characteristics: being
a man, older age, being Mexican American, lower edu-
cation status, and current smoking. Blood lead levels were
also higher in the poorest group (PIR1.0), although
differences by PIR groups were not significant (P=.80).
Logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education status, and PIR showed that higher
blood lead quintile was significantly associated with higher
odds of meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD (P=.05 for
trend) and PD (P=.02 for trend) but not for GAD (P=.78)
(Table 3 [model A]). Persons with blood lead levels in
the highest quintile had 2.3 times the odds of MDD (95%
CI, 1.13-4.75) and nearly 5 times the odds of PD (1.32-
18.48) as those in the lowest quintile. Sex and race/
ethnicity were significantly associated with the risk of dis-
orders (both at P.01), but age, education status, and
PIR (P.3 for each) were not. Mexican American per-
sons had the lowest rates of MDD and PD but the high-
est blood lead levels. Men had lower rates of disorders
but higher blood lead levels than did women.
We saw little difference by sex in the associations of
blood lead levels with MDD, and an interaction term added
to the logistic regression model was not significant

(P=.76). There were too few cases of PD among men to
analyze them separately, but the association among
women only was similar to the combined results.
To evaluate possible cohort effects, we added a term for
years of data collection to the models, but this term was
not significant (P=.99 for MDD, P=.53 for PD, and P=.54
for GAD) and did not appreciably change the associations
with blood lead. We also evaluated the odds of each of the
3 disorders with respect to blood lead levels on a continu-
ous scale (log10
transformed), and this resulted in findings
similar to the previous trend analyses, with higher blood
lead levels being associated with increased odds of MDD
(for each doubling of blood lead: OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93-
1.53; P=.16) and PD (1.44; 1.02-2.03; P=.04) but not GAD
(1.11; 0.76-1.63; P=.56).
Because current smoking is related to blood lead level
and psychiatric disorder status, we conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses excluding the 628 current smokers (Table 3
[model B]). For MDD, this resulted in ORs slightly higher
than those obtained when including these individuals and
a significant trend for increasing odds across increasing
blood lead quintiles (P=.03). Increasing quintiles of blood
lead levels were also significantly associated with higher
odds of PD (P=.01 for trend). The OR for the highest
blood lead quintile was substantially higher than that in
model A; however, its wide 95% CI was owing to the few
cases in this analysis (n=14).
Exclusion of individuals with blood lead levels of 10
µg/dL or higher (n=13) did not affect the results, with
changes only to the second decimal of the estimates. The

results were only minimally affected by the exclusion of
pregnant women and women whose pregnancy status
could not be ascertained (n=299), with estimates within
10% of those for model A and similar P values for trend
(MDD: P=.05; PD: P=.02; and GAD: P=.50).
Many individuals met the criteria for more than 1 dis-
order,thus,wewantedtoexplorethespecificityoftheblood
lead association for a single diagnosis. Of individuals with
MDD, 6% also met the criteria for PD, 10% for GAD, and
7% for both. In an analysis of the 104 cases of MDD with
no comorbid disorders, the findings were similar to those
for all cases. The numbers of persons with PD (n=24) and
GAD (n=22) with no comorbidity were too small to re-
strict the analytic sample to these individuals only.
COMMENT
In the present study, we observed that increasing blood
lead levels were associated with a significantly higher risk
of MDD and PD in young adults in the United States. Com-
pared with persons with a blood lead level of less than
0.7 µg/dL (the lowest quintile of blood lead in the study
population), those with a level greater than 2.1 µg/dL (the
highest quintile) had a 2.3-fold increased risk of meet-
ing DSM-IV criteria for MDD and a 4.9-fold increased risk
of PD. After excluding current smokers, the elevation in
risk was increased to 2.5-fold for MDD and to 8.2-fold
for PD. Although estimates of risk for specific quintiles
were imprecise because of the few cases, particularly for
PD, the trend analyses support the presence of a signifi-
cant increase in risk across blood lead levels. Likewise,
models that use a continuous parameter for blood lead
levels also support this conclusion.
These results support previously reported associations
of mood and anxiety disorders with high occupational lead
exposure8-12 and less well-documented association with
lower environmental levels of exposure in older men.15,16
The present findings extend these observations to the gen-
eral US population of younger adults. Women are at sig-
nificantly increased risk of meeting the diagnostic criteria
for MDD and anxiety disorders, an observation that is well
documented.19 In exploratory analyses, we saw no evi-
dence of differential association by sex for blood lead lev-
els and odds for these disorders, but a larger sample is nec-
essary to carefully verify this hypothesis.
If lead exposure contributes to the etiology of these
disorders, the mechanism of action could involve per-
turbationofneurochemicalprocesses,suchasbrainmono-
amine neurotransmission. Lead exposure is known to dis-
rupt catecholaminergic systems,33-35 and depression and
anxiety disorders are strongly associated with distur-
bances in these systems.36 Studies in animals35 show that
long-term lead exposure can decrease serotoninergic ac-
tivity in several brain regions, including the nucleus ac-

cumbens, frontal cortex, and brainstem. In a study37 of
patients with PD with or without depression, positron
emissiontomographyrevealedthatserotoninreceptortype
1A levels were reduced by almost one third in the ante-
rior and posterior cingulates and the raphe nuclei.37 Ex-
posure to lead in predisposed individuals could trigger
the development of depression and PD, increase their se-
verity, or modify the response to treatments. Investiga-
tions on how low lead exposure disrupts neurochemi-
cal processes could provide insights into the mechanisms
of depressive and anxious states.
Comorbidity was observed in the present study, par-
ticularly for the 2 anxiety disorders with depression. When
we conducted an analysis of MDD in which we excluded
persons with MDD and another disorder, the findings were
similar to those in which we included all persons, sug-
gesting that the increased odds of MDD with higher blood
lead levels was not explained by the anxiety disorders.
One of the strengths of the present study is the use of
structured diagnostic assessments of psychiatric disor-
ders.17 The CIDI has been widely used in psychiatric re-
search and has a high degree of correspondence with clini-
cal interviews.22 Also, the prevalences observed in the
present study for the 3 conditions studied were compa-
rable with those of other national estimates19 (MDD: 7.8%
vs 6.7%, PD: 2.6% vs 2.7%, and GAD: 3.0% vs 3.1%). This
suggests that the results of the present study can be gen-
eralized to the broader US population.
The present study has several limitations, the most im-
portant being its cross-sectional design. Thus, we can-
not rule out the possibility that MDD or PD leads to be-
havioral changes that increase exposure to lead, except
in the case of smoking, for which the sensitivity analysis
in current nonsmokers argues strongly against. In addi-
tion, the mental health outcomes under study herein are
chronic conditions often associated with genetic predis-
position in conjunction with long-term stressors.38 There-
fore, in assessing the role of lead as a risk factor for men-
tal health outcomes, it would have been desirable to have
an indicator of long-term lead exposure, such as bone
lead level, assessed before the onset of psychiatric symp-
toms. Bone lead level has a clearance half-life of years to
decades, depending on the bone type.39 In a previous
study,15 blood and patella bone lead levels were associ-
ated with a combined measure of anxiety, phobia, and
depression symptoms. In the present study, lead was mea-
sured in blood only. The half-life of lead in blood after
acute exposure is short, but blood lead concentration in-
tegrates lead released from bones and current external
exposures. In settings in which external exposures are
low, lead released from bones can be the major contribu-
tor to blood lead levels. Thus, blood lead level may be a
reasonable marker of long-term exposure when the sys-
tem is in equilibrium, with little variation in intake, clear-
ance, or bone-blood partitioning. Situations in which this
would not apply are occupational exposures, which might
vary greatly in time, and osteoporosis, during which lead
is released from the bone matrix to the blood at an in-
creased rate after demineralization.40 In the present study,
however, few individuals were likely to have osteoporo-
sis because of their young age (maximum age, 40 years).
We could not exclude occupationally exposed individu-
als because of limited information on job exposures, but
the exclusion of those with elevated blood lead levels
would likely capture any current work-related lead ex-
posure and did not alter the results.
As in any observational study, the associations in this
study could be biased by uncontrolled confounders. We
did, however, adjust for several important likely con-
founding factors (sex, age, race/ethnicity, education sta-
tus, and annual income). Furthermore, the sensitivity
analyses that excluded current smokers indicate that re-
sidual confounding by smoking does not explain the as-
sociations of blood lead levels and risk of psychiatric
disease but, in fact, may partly mask it.
Current blood lead levels in the US population are
lower than they were in the mid-20th century,2 but they
remain elevated from an evolutionary perspective, that
is, in relation to the natural lead levels before industri-
alization.41 Widespread lead pollution has occurred only
in relatively modern history as a result of anthropo-
genic activity.42 The finding of an association between
blood lead level and MDD and PD, despite the low lev-
els and narrow range of observed lead levels, supports
the contention that current lead exposures at low levels
may have important effects on mental health. Because the
current measurements of blood lead level reflect, in part,
lead sequestered in bone, the observed relations with in-
creased odds of depression and PD could also reflect la-
tent effects of past exposures during critical develop-
mental periods, which would be consistent with
neurodevelopmental hypotheses of mood and anxiety dis-
orders.43 If lead exposure contributes to the etiology of
MDD and PD, continued efforts at reducing population
exposures even beyond currently acceptable levels may
decrease their incidence.
In conclusion, risks of MDD and PD in young adults
increased with higher blood lead levels. These findings
suggest that lead neurotoxicity may contribute to ad-
verse mental health outcomes, even at levels generally
considered to pose low or no risk. These findings, com-
bined with recent reports44,45 of adverse behavioral out-
comes in children with similarly low blood lead levels,
should underscore the need for considering ways to fur-
ther reduce environmental lead exposures.
