Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy on the percentage
of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood of
patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: Peripheral blood was taken from patients with NCSLC (before and after chemother-
apy) and control subjects with nonmalignant disease. The percentages of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Tregs were analysed using flow cytometry.
Results: Patients (n ¼ 40) had significantly higher CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
percentages than control subjects (n ¼ 24). CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­ percentages
increased with tumour progression, fell significantly after chemotherapy, but remained significantly
higher than control values.
Conclusions: CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­ Treg percentages were higher in patients
with NSCLC than control subjects, and increased in line with tumour progression. Percentages of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­ Tregs were significantly reduced following gemcitabine
plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ T cells, which inhibit
antitumour immunity by suppressing
tumour-specific effector T cells. These Tregs
function through cell-to-cell interactions3
and/or secretion of cytokines such as inter-
leukin (IL)-10 or transforming growth factor
(TGF)-b.4,5 The number and activity of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ Tregs increase in
patients with cancer,1,6­10 and their presence
correlates with unfavourable prognosis.
CD8þCD28­ Tregs also have a regulatory
function,10,11 suppressing the cytotoxic func-
tion and proliferation of T lymphocytes. It is
possible that the depletion or suppression of
Tregs could prevent tumour immune
escape.12,13
Chemotherapy cannot discriminate
between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells,
and may therefore be detrimental to
host-antitumour immunity. Conventional
chemotherapeutic agents (including cyclo-
phosphamide and fludarabine) downregu-
late the number and function of
CD4þCD25þ Tregs in animal models14 and
human cancer.15 First-line treatment for
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is gem-
citabinepluscisplatinchemotherapy,butlittle
is known regarding the immunomodulatory
effects of this treatment. Gemcitabine
enhancesantitumorimmuneactivitybyselect-
ively eliminating splenic Gr-1þ/CD11bþ mye-
loid suppressor cells in tumour-bearing
animal models.16 In addition, cisplatin plus
vinorelbine augment antitumor immunity by
modulating the function and reducing the
proportion of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ Tregs
in animal models.17 It is not known whether
the therapeutic doses of gemcitabine
plus cisplatin would produce similar results
in patients with NSCLC. In addition, there
are no data available regarding the sensitivity
of CD8þCD28­ Tregs to cisplatin or
gemcitabine.
The aim of this study was to investigate
the effect of gemcitabine plus cisplatin
chemotherapy on the percentage of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
regulatory T cells (Tregs) and natural killer
(NK) cells in the peripheral blood of
patients with NSCLC.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study included patients aged >20 and
<75 years with histologically confirmed
NSCLC who were treated at Zhoushan
Hospital, Zhoushan, China between
October 2012 and July 2013. Tumours were
staged according to NCCN clinical practice
guidelines (2012).18 The control group com-
prised patients with nonmalignant disease.
Inclusion criteria were: Karnofsky perform-
ance status (PS) >80%; satisfactory haem-
atological and biochemical parameters
(neutrophil count !2.0 Â 109/l, haemoglobin
!100.0 g/l, platelet count !100 Â 109/l,
aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and ala-
nine aminotransferase [ALT] 80U/l); life
expectancy >3 months. Exclusion criteria
were: previous malignancies; secondary lung
cancer; previous anticancer treatment; con-
comitant immune enhancing or immune
suppressing diseases including bacterial,
fungal or viral infections.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of Zhoushan Hospital,
Zhoushan, China, and written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Patient assessment and treatment
Before treatment, patients underwent phys-
ical examination, chest computed tomog-
raphy (CT), head CT or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardio-
gram, abdominal B-ultrasonography, pul-
monary function tests, emission computed
tomography, full blood count and serum
biochemical analyses.
Chemotherapy was a 21 ¼ day treatment
cycle comprising gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2
on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on
day 1.

Flow cytometry
Peripheral blood (2 ml) was taken before
surgery, on day 0 (before initiation of first
round of chemotherapy) and day 20 (before
initiation of second round of chemother-
apy). Blood samples were collected in sterile
heparinized vials and analysed immediately.
Aliquots of heparinized whole blood (100 ml)
were incubated for 15 min at room tempera-
ture with antibodies (all BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA): (i) FITC-conjugated
mouse antihuman CD4, APC-conjugated
mouse antihuman CD25 and PE-conjugated
mouse antihuman FOXP3; (ii) FITC-
conjugated mouse antihuman CD8 and
PE-conjugated mouse antihuman CD28; or
(iii) FITC-conjugated mouse antihuman
CD3 and PE-conjugated mouse antihuman
CD16/CD56. Erythrocytes were lysed using
lysing solution and washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), contain-
ing 2% fetal calf serum and 2% sodium
azide. Intranuclear staining of FOXP3 was
performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions (BD Biosciences).
Cells were analysed by FACSCaliburTM
(BD Biosciences), and the resulting data
were analysed using CellQuestTM software.
A minimum of 5000 gated events/condition
were analysed. CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ cells
were quantified as a percentage of CD4þ
cells, CD8þCD28­ cells were quantified as a
percentage of CD8þ cells, and NK
(CD3­CD16þCD56þ) cells were quantified
as a percentage of lymphocytes.
Statistical analyses
Date were expressed as mean Æ SD. Due to
nonhomogeneity of variance and small
sample size, data comparing differences
between patients and controls in Treg
percentages were assessed using Mann­
Whitney nonparametric U-test. The differ-
ences between tumour subgroups and
controls in the Treg percentages were ana-
lysed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by LSD for multiple
mean comparisons. When variables were not
normally distributed, Kruskal­Wallis test
followed by Dunnett T3 was used.
Comparisons of Treg percentages before
and after chemotherapy were made using
paired-sample t-test. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The study included 40 patients with NSCLC
(30 male/10 female; mean age 62.1 Æ 9.2
years; age range 38­74 years) and 24 control
subjects (17 male/7 female; mean age
57.8 Æ 14.3 years; age range 35­74 years).
There were no statistically significant
between-group differences in age or sex. In
the patient group, four individuals with
stage Ia tumours underwent surgery only,
and seven patients with stage IV tumours
received chemotherapy only. The remaining
29 patients (stage Ib­IIIa) underwent sur-
gery followed by chemotherapy 30 days
later. Tumours included squamous carcin-
oma (n ¼ 17) and adenocarcinoma (n ¼ 23).
In samples taken before surgery, patients
with NSCLC had significantly higher
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
Treg percentages than control subjects
(P < 0.001 for each comparison; Table 1).
There was no between-group difference in
percentages of NK cells.
Patients with NSCLC were stratified
according to tumour stage (stage I/II and
stage III/IV). Percentages of both
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
Tregs increased significantly with tumour
progression (P < 0.001 for each comparison;
Table 1).
Populations of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Tregs were significantly
lower after chemotherapy than at baseline in
the total patient group (P < 0.001 for each
182 Journal of International Medical Research 43(2)
comparison; Table 2). There were no sig-
nificant changes in percentages of NK cells.
Postchemotherapy percentages of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ Tregs were signifi-
cantly higher in patients with stage III/IV
disease than in controls (P < 0.001; Table 2).
Postchemotherapy percentages of
CD8þCD28­ Tregs were significantly
higher in both patient subgroups than in
controls (P < 0.001 for each comparison,
Table 2).
Discussion
Percentages of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and
CD8þCD28­ Tregs were higher in patients
with NSCLC than in control subjects with
nonmalignant lung disease in the present
study. In addition, CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Treg populations
increased with tumour progression, which
is consistent with findings from other cancer
types.10,11,19­21 In accordance with findings
in early stage prostate cancer,8 the present
study indicated a higher percentage of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
Tregs in early stage NSCLC patients com-
pared with control subjects.
It is thought that Tregs may play a crucial
role in inhibiting anticancer defence, and
their depletion or suppression may therefore
represent an important strategy to prevent
tumour immune escape.12,22 Chemotherapy
was traditionally thought to be deleterious
to antitumour immunity, but some chemo-
therapy agents may have the potential to
augment anticancer immunity by inhibiting
immune tolerance and suppression.
Paclitaxel has been found to inhibit the
number and function of
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ Tregs directly.23 In
addition, cyclophosphamide was reported to
inhibit the activity of CD4þCD25þ Tregs,14
and the generation and function of
CD8þCD28­ Tregs.24 In contrast, arsenic
trioxide, dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and
methotrexate increase the frequency of
Tregs in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells activated with T-cell mitogen.25 The
above data suggest that chemotherapeutic
agents may have varying effects on Treg
populations and activity.
Percentages of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Tregs were significantly
reduced following chemotherapy in the pre-
sent study. To our knowledge, this is the first

study to focus on changes in Treg subpopu-
lations in the peripheral blood of patients
with NSCLC undergoing gemcitabine plus
cisplatin chemotherapy. Our findings sug-
gest that, in addition to inducing tumour cell
death via cytotoxic effects, gemcitabine plus
cisplatin exert anticancer activity by
decreasing the numbers of circulating
Tregs in these patients. The fact that
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
Treg postchemotherapy percentages
remained higher than those of control sub-
jects suggests that the remaining cancer may
continue to feed the mechanism underlying
the raised Treg levels.
The present study has several limitations.
The study population was small, necessitat-
ing the merging of subgroups for statistical
analyses. As a result our findings should be
interpreted cautiously, since a larger sample
size is needed. In addition, it was outside the
scope of our study to determine whether the
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ and CD8þCD28­
cells we identified displayed suppressive
activity. Consequently we cannot categoric-
ally state that these cells are regulatory/
suppressive T cells. Chemotherapy may not
only decrease Treg number but also inhibit
functionality,23,26 and further investigations
into functional changes will allow insight
into the immunoregulatory effect of gemci-
tabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy. Our
study investigated combination gemcitabine
and cisplatin chemotherapy, and it is not
possible to extrapolate our findings to deter-
mine the impact of each agent individually.
This could be overcome via dose­response
analysis of single agents in animal models.
Finally, NK cells provide a first line of
defence against infections and malignant
cells, but our study found no significant
differences in NK-cell percentages between

chemotherapy, and control subjects with nonmalignant disease.

patients and controls, as well as before and
after chemotherapy. NK cells have been
reported to be dysfunctional in a number of
cancers,27­29 and to be affected in various
ways by exposure to chemotherapeutic
agents.30­34 Further studies are required to
investigate the function of NK cells during
chemotherapy, and to explain more fully the
relationship between chemotherapy and
antitumour immunity.
In conclusion, CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Treg percentages were
higher in patients with NSCLC than control
subjects with nonmalignant lung disease,
and increased in line with tumour progres-
sion. Percentages of CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ
and CD8þCD28­ Tregs were significantly
reduced following gemcitabine plus cisplatin
chemotherapy.
