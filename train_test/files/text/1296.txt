OBJECTIVE -- To estimate all-cause hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, and deaths
attributable to diabetes using a new methodology based on longitudinal data for a representative
sample of older U.S. adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A simulation model, based on data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I Epidemiologic Followup Study,
was used to represent the natural history of diabetes and control for a variety of baseline risk
factors. The model was applied to 6,265 NHANES III adults aged 45­74 years. The prevalence
of risk factors in NHANES III, fielded in 1988­1994, better represents today's adults.
RESULTS -- For all NHANES III adults aged 45­74 years, a diagnosis of diabetes accounted
for 8.6% of hospitalizations, 12.3% of nursing home admissions, and 10.3% of deaths in 1988­
1994. For people with diabetes, diabetes alone was responsible for 43.4% of hospitalizations,
52.1% of nursing home admissions, and 47% of deaths. Adjusting for related cardiovascular
conditions, which may provide more accurate estimates of attributable risks for people with
diabetes, increased these estimates to 51.4, 57.1, and 56.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS -- Risks of institutionalization and death attributable to diabetes are large.
Efforts to translate recent trials of primary prevention into practice and continued efforts to
prevent complications of diabetes could have a substantial impact on hospitalizations, nursing
home admissions, and deaths and their societal costs.
Diabetes Care 28:1611­1617, 2005
The prevalence of diabetes, 8.7% in
2002 (1), is rising. Although longer
survival due to better treatment has
contributed to higher prevalence, the
sharpest increase has occurred among
people aged 30­39 years, indicating that
incidence is also rising. Growing numbers
of people are thus at risk of diabetes com-
plications, particularly cardiovascular
disease (2), and the disability and death
that accompany them. Recent trials (3­9)
have shown that diabetes complications
can be prevented or delayed by new inter-
ventions for hyperglycemia, hyperten-
sion, and hyperlipidemia. Other trials in
high-risk populations have suggested that
lifestyle interventions may delay or pre-
vent onset of type 2 diabetes (10­12).
As background for prevention and
control efforts, this report presents new
estimates of all-cause hospitalizations,
nursing home admissions, and deaths at-
tributable to diabetes. We used a method-
ology based on the first and third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES), two of the surveys that
provide data for national health goals and
clinical guidelines. Epidemiological
methodologists note that cohort studies
are more reliable than cross-sectional data
for establishing the existence and magni-
tude of etiologic relationships (13­14).
We used the NHANES I Epidemiologic
Followup Study (NHEFS), a cohort study
that tracked outcomes over 2 decades
(1971­1992), to develop a simulation
model that projects diabetes outcomes.
We applied the simulation model to
adults aged 45­74 years from NHANES
III. Fielded in 1988­1994, NHANES III
better represents today's adults (e.g.,
more obesity, fewer smokers). Our meth-
odology allowed us to make estimates for
diabetes alone and for diabetes together
with major cardiovascular risk factors
that cluster with diabetes. The estimates
contribute to a more complete picture of
diabetes' impact on the population as a
whole and on people with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The NHANES, large
national surveys conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, collect
health information for representative
samples of noninstitutionalized Ameri-
cans. The simulation model used here is
based on equations that link risk factors
measured at baseline in NHANES I to out-
comes recorded during NHEFS follow-up
to reproduce the natural course of diabe-
tes. At four follow-ups (1982­1984,
1986, 1987, and 1992), survey partici-
pants (or proxies for deceased or incapac-
itated subjects) were interviewed about all
stays in health facilities since baseline or

previous follow-up; their reports were
matched with institutional records,
which were also searched for additional
stays. Deaths were confirmed by death
certificate. The simulation model is ap-
plied to NHANES III adults aged 45­74
years to estimate the attributable risks of
diabetes.
The simulation model has four com-
ponents: the cohort dataset, which con-
tains baseline information about
NHANES III adults aged 45­74 years; the
mortality submodel, which projects all-
cause mortality; and the hospitalization
and nursing home submodels, which
project admissions. Each submodel uses
separate regressions, estimated from
NHEFS, for men aged 45­64 years at
baseline, women aged 45­64 years, men
aged 65­74 years, and women aged
65­74 years; NHEFS excluded people
older than 74. The multivariable regres-
sions relate admissions and mortality to
all clinical risk factors shown by multiple
studies to be statistically significantly re-
lated to disease and/or death (Table 1).
The effects of diabetes in the model are
thus its net effects after adjustment for the
effects of all other risk factors. Diabetes is
a statistically significant determinant of all
three outcomes.
NHANES I defined diabetes as
present if an adult reported having re-
ceived a doctor's diagnosis of diabetes
(fasting blood glucose was not measured).
Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90­
95% of diabetes, was not distinguished
from type 1. Diagnostic criteria, and the
medical management of diabetes,
changed little from the 1970s to the early
1990s (15); newer antiglycemic agents
were not yet available and antihyperten-
sive and anticholesterolemic medications
only became widespread in the later
1980s. Thus, equations fitted to NHEFS
data reasonably reflect the natural history
of diabetes and can be applied to
NHANES III adults, who were diagnosed
by the same criteria. In-sample and out-
of-sample tests of the model are presented
in (16­17). For this report, the model
was updated to incorporate data for
1988­1992, the final NHEFS follow-up
(18).
Cohort dataset
The cohort dataset includes all NHANES
III respondents aged 45­74 years who
were examined by a physician (n

Attributable risk of diabetes
1612 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 28, NUMBER 7, JULY 2005
tion and only 13 individuals lacked data
for more than five risk factors, all sample
subjects were retained; the age-sex mean
for each risk factor replaced missing val-
ues. Most risk factors, including diabetes,
were defined identically in NHANES I
and III.
Simulation submodels
The mortality submodel is based on
Weibull hazard functions that relate sur-
vival to baseline risk factors. The hospital
and nursing home submodels use nega-
tive binomial regressions to relate annual
admissions to the same risk factors. (Re-
gressions available on request.) Estimates
of admissions are adjusted for survival us-
ing the mortality submodel.
Sample weights
NHANES III was a stratified cluster sam-
ple. Since all individuals in the cohort re-
ceived medical examinations, the
"examined sample final weight" was used
to derive population totals.
Estimates
We calculated baseline estimates of ad-
missions and deaths by entering observed
baseline risk factors for the 6,265
NHANES III adults aged 45­74 years into
the model regressions and running the
model. Following the traditional defini-
tion of attributable risk as the "most we
can hope to accomplish in reducing the
risk of the disease if we completely elim-
inate the exposure" (13), we estimated
outcomes for the scenarios listed below
and calculated attributable risks as dif-
ferences between these scenarios and
baseline.
 All people with a diagnosis of diabetes,
and thus with a baseline value of one for
the dichotomous variable representing
diabetes, had this value changed to
zero. All other risk factors remained at
baseline values.
 In addition to setting diabetes at zero,
systolic blood pressure, serum choles-
terol, and rates of cardiovascular condi-
tions associated with diabetes (heart
attack, heart failure, and stroke) were
reduced in people with diabetes so that
the means of these risk factors equaled
those for people without diabetes.
Since diabetes and other risk factors for
heart disease are linked, the true attrib-
utable risk of diabetes includes higher

*Like all NHANES, NHANES I surveyed noninstitutionalized people capable of traveling to the examination trailers, thus they were healthier than the general noninstitutionalized population. NHANES I women
aged 45­64 years initially had very low mortality; the projection equations reflect this early advantage. Their mortality soon regressed to the mean and to the national men-to-women ratio for this age-group
(2:1). Relative differences due to diabetes are not affected.

rates of these risk factors in people with
diabetes.
Differences between baseline and sce-
nario 1 represent admissions and deaths
attributable to diabetes. Differences be-
tween baseline and scenario 2 show ad-
missions and deaths attributable to
diabetes plus related cardiovascular risk
factors.
RESULTS -- Table 1 shows risk factor
means for all NHANES III adults and peo-
ple with diabetes weighted to represent
noninstitutionalized adults in 1988 ­
1994. Eight percent of men and women
aged 45­64 years, 11.2% of men aged
65­74 years, and 12.6% of women aged
65­74 years had a diagnosis of diabetes.
People with diabetes were more likely to
report having had heart attack, heart fail-
ure, or stroke.
The effects of diabetes on hospital ad-
missions, nursing home admissions, and
deaths are shown in Table 2 (1st year after
baseline) and Table 3 (10th year after
baseline) for all people and people with
diabetes. Percentage reductions from
baseline show the attributable risk for
each outcome.
For all people aged 45­74 years, dia-
betes accounted for 8.6% of hospital ad-
missions per 1,000 people in the 1st year,
12.3% of nursing home admissions, and
10.3% of all-cause mortality. Percentages
were larger for people aged 45­64 years
than for the elderly and larger for women
than men. For example, diabetes ac-
counted for 8.0% of hospital admissions
in middle-aged men and 11.5% in mid-
dle-aged women compared with 4.8 and
9.1% for elderly men and women, respec-
tively. The impact on the elderly in num-
bers of events was larger, however,
because their rates of admission and death
were higher than those of people aged
45­64 years.
The population impact reflects a
much larger impact on the group directly
affected: people with diabetes. For them,
diabetes accounts for nearly half of all
three outcomes: 43% of hospital admis-
sions per 1,000, 52% of nursing home
admissions, and 47% of deaths. Although
the percentages are larger for middle-aged
than elderly people, they are large in all
age-sex groups. Among elderly men with
diabetes, diabetes accounted for 29.4% of
hospital admissions; baseline admissions
per 1,000 were 280 compared with 197

per 1,000 for scenario 1. Among elderly
women with diabetes, diabetes accounted
for 37% of hospital admissions (374 vs.
235 per 1,000). Diabetes also accounted
for 56% of nursing home admissions for
elderly men and 33% for elderly women
and 40% of deaths in both groups.
At 10 years, the population risks at-
tributable to diabetes were somewhat
less, reflecting higher mortality rates
among people with diabetes, especially
the elderly (Table 3). Even with diabetes
eliminated, Table 2 shows that deaths per
1,000 for diabetic elderly men were 10.8
in year 1, compared with 10 for all elderly
men, and 6.8 per 1,000 for diabetic el-
derly women, compared with 5.2 for all
elderly women, because of their higher
rates of other serious chronic conditions.
Thus, by year 10, diabetic individuals
were a smaller share of the cohort.
The impact on people with diabetes
themselves, however, remained large at
year 10 (Table 3). Percentage reductions
were close to those in year 1 for diabetic
people aged 45­64 years and somewhat
lower for people aged 65­74 years. Forty-
three percent of hospital admissions in
men aged 45­ 64 years and 52% in
women aged 45­64 years were attribut-
able to diabetes. Diabetes accounted for
21 and 31% of hospitalizations in elderly
men and women, respectively. It ac-
counted for about two-thirds of nursing
home admissions in middle-aged people,
51% in elderly men, and 26% in elderly
women. Approximately 45% of deaths in
diabetic people aged 45­64 years were
attributable to diabetes and a third of
deaths in those aged 65­74 years.
Table 4 shows the effects of equaliz-
ing cardiovascular risk factors related to
diabetes so that people with diabetes had
the same means as people without diabe-
tes. In addition to eliminating diabetes
(scenario 1), scenario 2 set the means of
systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol,
and rates of heart attack, heart failure, and
stroke in diabetic people equal to those in
people without diabetes. Since diabetes
clusters with these risk factors, scenario 2
may more closely approximate the true
attributable risks of diabetes. In people
with diabetes, percentages of hospitaliza-
tions and deaths attributable to diabetes
increased by 8 to 10 percentage points to
51.4 and 56.8%, respectively, after car-
diovascular conditions were equalized.
The attributable percentage of nursing
home admissions increased 5 percentage
points.
CONCLUSIONS -- We have pre-
sented new estimates of the risks of hos-
pitalization, nursing home admission,
and all-cause mortality attributable to di-
abetes based on the NHANES I Epidemi-
ologic Follow-up Study and NHANES III.
For the population aged 45­74 years as a
whole, diagnosed diabetes accounted for
8.6% of hospitalizations in 1988­1994,
12.3% of nursing home admissions, and
10.3% of deaths. The percentages were
lower for older people than middle-aged
people, but absolute reductions in event
rates were similar or greater because of
their higher rates. Nursing home admis-
sions, disproportionately an experience
of old age, showed the greatest effect of
diabetes.
For people with diabetes, the percent-
ages were naturally much larger: 43% of
hospital admissions, 52% of nursing
home admissions, and 47% of deaths due
to diabetes. The percentages remained
large in the 10th year, and absolute reduc-
tions were larger for all age-sex groups
and all outcomes than in year 1. The at-
tenuated effects in the overall population
at year 10 are explained by higher mortal-
ity among diabetic people due to their
higher rates of other chronic conditions.
Adjusting for factors that cluster with
diabetes and are part of the metabolic syn-
drome (higher blood pressure and choles-
terol, higher rates of heart attack, heart
failure, and stroke) increased the risks at-
tributable to diabetes by 8 to 10 percent-
age points for hospitalizations and deaths
but less for nursing home admissions.
These adjustments corrected for condi-
tions associated with diabetes that were
diagnosed at baseline in NHANES III
adults.
Besides showing substantial health
benefits from controlling or preventing
diabetes, these estimates represent medi-
cal resources that would not be used if
diabetes were prevented. Studies (19­24)
show that people with diabetes have
higher medical costs than nondiabetic
people. Most analyzed data for enrollees
in a single managed care plan and mea-
sured services as a step toward estimating
costs. The hospitalization and nursing
home estimates that underlie the cost es-
timates of the ADA are closest to those
presented here (25). The ADA used an
attributable-risk methodology, for the
U.S. population, and defined diabetes
based on a doctor's diagnosis.
The methodology used in this report
has several advantages. It used two linked
nationally representative datasets rather
than multiple datasets as the ADA did to
estimate effects of diabetes on outcomes.
In estimating diabetes' effects, the meth-
odology controlled not only for age, sex,
and race but for numerous patient-level
characteristics, including other risk fac-

tors for cardiovascular disease. The data
used for the projection equations were
prospective and traced outcomes over 2
decades, providing a stronger basis for
correctly measuring causal relationships
than cross-sectional data.
The estimates presented here agree in
magnitude with the ADA estimates, lend-
ing strength to their findings and suggest-
ing that diabetes itself is driving cross-
sectional differences in costs. The ADA
reported that hospital days attributable to
diabetes accounted for 9% of all hospital
days and nursing home days for 15% of all
nursing home days, similar to the 8.6 and
12.3% of admissions estimated here for
diabetes alone and the 10.2 and 13.6%
estimated after adjustment for related car-
diovascular conditions. Overall, the ADA
reported that diabetic people had more
than double the hospital inpatient and
nursing home costs of nondiabetic peo-
ple, which implies that diabetes accounts
for 50% of the costs of diabetic people
in these settings. Our estimates are for ad-
missions, not costs, but are in general
agreement. In particular, our estimates for
diabetes plus related cardiovascular con-
ditions are 50­51.4% of hospitaliza-
tions and 57.1% of nursing home
admissions.
Our estimates have potential limita-
tions. First, since our study measures the
impact of all diabetes, without differenti-
ating between types 1 and 2, it overstates
the impact of eliminating type 2; how-
ever, the overstatement is modest since
type 2 accounts for 90­95% of all diabe-
tes. Second, current treatment is more ef-
fective than treatment during the 1970s
and 1980s; hence, our baseline estimates
may overstate the current impact of dia-
betes. Finally, national trends in hospital
admissions during NHEFS follow-up sug-
gested that our hospitalization projec-
tions might be high. Hospitalization rates
measured by the National Hospital Dis-
charge Survey (NHDS) rose from 1970 to
the early 1980s then fell until the early
1990s; they continued to fall through
2000 for people aged 45­64 years but
rose again for people aged 65 years
(26). Rates for NHANES III adults should
be lower than NHDS rates because they
were drawn from the noninstitutionalized
population; since they were able to travel
to an examination site, they may have
been even healthier than the general non-
institutionalized population. To check
that our projected admission rates were
reasonable, we compared year 1 projec-
tions with 1990­2000 NHDS rates for the
same age-sex groups. As they should be,
our projections were uniformly lower,
60­90% of the NHDS rates.
Our results support the extensive
work documenting diabetes' adverse ef-
fects by estimating its impact on hospital-
izations, nursing home admissions, and
mortality in a representative sample of
older U.S. adults. They suggest that efforts
to generalize the Diabetes Prevention Pro-
gram, for example through the "Small
Steps, Big Rewards" campaign sponsored
by the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, could have a substantial impact
on diabetes-related outcomes. If diabetes
could be prevented completely, we esti-
mate that rates of hospitalization, nursing
home admission, and death would fall by
about half for people spared diabetes, and
the beneficial effects would be sustained
over 10 years. Our study offers another
insight into the value of efforts to prevent
and control diabetes.
