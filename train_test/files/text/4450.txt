Introduction
Whole grains, refined cereals, and legumes are important
components of diets in many areas in the world. Cereals are
major sources of energy, proteins, and other nutrients.1,2
Whole grains, refined cereals, dried peas, and beans differ
from each other in their structural and physicochemical
properties, and their physiological effects. These differ-
ences result from variations in their polysaccharides
composition and, more specifically, in the quantity and
variety of dietary fibers and starch.1 In addition, protein
content and the amount of phytochemicals, vitamins,
minerals, and other bioactive components present play a
role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).1 The
beneficial effects of whole grains on the prevention and
management of chronic diseases (such as coronary heart
disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, inflammation, and
cancer) were reported in observational and interventional
studies.3,4
In Jordan, the staple foods are wheat and rice. Khobez, a
leavened flat wheat bread (pita bread), is consumed daily
with most meals and often used to scoop other foods.5 The
per capita supply of cereals, which consists mainly of wheat
and, to a much lesser extent of rice, has remained rather sta-
ble since the early 1980s. Within this food group, the supply
of rice tends to increase slightly over the period.5 Boiled rice
could be eaten plain, spicy, or with sauces. Also, many veg-
etables (green beans, okra, cauliflower, eggplants, spinach,
etc) are usually cooked or served with rice.5 Epidemiological,

Abstract
Background. The role of whole grains, refined cereals, and legumes in preventing or initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) is still
uncertain. The aim of this study is to examine the possible association between the consumption of whole grains, refined
cereals, and legumes and the risk of developing CRC among Jordanian population. Methods. A validated food frequency
questionnaire was used to collect dietary data with regard to intake of whole grains, refined cereals, and legumes. A total
of 220 diagnosed CRC participants and 281 CRC-free control participants matched by age, gender, occupation, and marital
status were recruited. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of developing CRC in relation to the consumption
of different types of whole grains, refined cereals, and legumes. Results. The odds ratio (OR) for developing CRC among
cases consumed refined wheat bread at all meals was 3.1 compared with controls (95% CI: 1.2-7.9, P
-Trend
= 0.001); whereas
the OR associated with whole wheat bread was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.22-0.92, P
-Trend
= 0.001). The statistical evaluation for daily
consumption of rice suggested a direct association with the risk of developing CRC, OR = 3.0 (95% CI: 0.27-33.4, P
-Trend
= 0.020). Weekly consumption of macaroni was associated with CRC with OR of 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1-5.3, P
-Trend
= 0.001).
The consumption of corn, bulgur, lentils, and peas suggested a protective trend, although the trend was not statistically
significant. Conclusion. This study provides additional indicators of the protective role of whole grains and suggests a direct
association between consumption of refined grains and higher possibility for developing CRC.

clinical, and animal research studies have indicated that
polyphenols and fibers (from whole grains and legumes)
may exert a protective effect against colon cancer.6-9
Cereals (either whole or refined) and legumes are the
main components of the Jordanian diet in which wheat is
the predominant type of cereals.5,10 The type of wheat con-
sumed in Jordan and Middle East is the hard red winter
wheat.11 Refined and whole wheat breads are commonly
produced from this type of wheat after processing.11
Unfortunately, the Jordanian population consumption of
refined red wheat flour bread was estimated to be about 326
g/d, while the consumption of the whole grain type was
about 3 g/d.10 Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the
possible association between whole grains, refined cereals,
and legumes intake and the risk of developing CRC in
Jordanian population.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population and Methods
A total of 501 volunteers participated in the study, 248
males and 253 females. Of those 220 were diagnosed
CRC cases, and 281 were healthy disease-free controls.
Participants were enrolled in the study from January 2010
to December 2012. Those diagnosed with CRC were
recruited from 5 large Jordanian hospitals (King Hussein
Cancer Center, King Abdullah University Hospital, Prince
Hamzeh Hospital, Jordan University Hospital, and
Al-Basheer Hospital) with oncology services. For inclu-
sion in the diagnosed CRC cancer group, subjects must
have obtained their diagnosis less than 1 year prior to the
time of the first interview in addition of being Jordanian
aged 18 years or older. Cases were excluded if they had a
critical illness, if they were currently hospitalized, or if
they complained of diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and
rheumatoid arthritis. To be included in the study as a con-
trol, volunteers had to be Jordanian aged 18 years or
older, apparently healthy, able to communicate clearly
and verbally, free of CRC, diabetes mellitus, liver dis-
ease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Because it was very diffi-
cult to enroll anyone outside the hospital setting, most of
the controls were selected using convenience sampling
from visitors and accompanying individuals (friends, rel-
atives, or neighbors) who were not first- or second-degree
relative or spouse of the CRC cases. In addition, outpa-
tients and hospital administrative staff were recruited.
The control group was matched as closely as possible for
age, gender, occupation, and marital status. The ratio for
cases against controls was 1:1.
The ethical committees of all 5 hospitals approved the
study protocol, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants prior to starting the study. The study
protocol was approved by the King Hussein Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board Committee (09 King Hussein
Cancer Center 10; May 2009), and other hospitals gave
their approval accordingly.
Data Collection
Trained research assistants collected the data through a
structured questionnaire and carried out the anthropometric
measurements. During the interview, different valid ques-
tionnaires were used to collect personal and family histo-
ries, diet history, and physical activity levels. Participants
were asked specifically if any of their family members were
ever diagnosed with CRC or any other type of cancer. The
anthropometric measurements, including body weight and
height and calculating body mass index (BMI), were carried
out according to Lee and Nieman12 by the trained research
assistants.
Food Frequency Questionnaire
A validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in Arabic
was used to assess the diets of the volunteers. The FFQ was
modified from the Diet History Questionnaire I of the US
National Cancer Institute. It was validated for use in the
Jordanian setting.13
For the CRC group, participants were asked about their
food intake before being diagnosed and during the past 12
months. For each food type, the participants were asked
whether they consumed each food item separately (eg, rice,
bulgur, cornflakes, white beans, etc). An answer in the affir-
mative resulted in additional questions related to frequency
and amount of food consumed. If the participants' diet did
not include a food type, then related questions were skipped.
Participants were asked how frequently, on average during
the past year, they consumed 1 standard serving of a spe-
cific food item in 9 different categories (<1 per month, 2-3
per month, 1-2 per week, 3-4 per week, 5-6 per week, 1 per
day, 2-3 per day, 4-5 per day, or 6 per day). Food models
and standard measuring tools were used to help participants
estimate the portion size they consumed. Responses on con-
sumption frequency of a specified serving size for each
food item were converted into average daily intake rates.13
Dietary intakes were also analyzed using dietary analysis
software (ESHA Food Processor SQL version 10.1.1;
ESHA, Salem, OR) with additional data on foods consumed
in Jordan.14
The 7-Day Physical Activity Recall
The 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) was originally
developed by Sallis et al15 and was used in this study to
measure physical activity level.16 The PAR interview
focuses on collecting data on intensity, time or duration, and
type of activity. The number of hours spent in different
320 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
activity levels were obtained and converted into metabolic
equivalents (METs). PAR covers different levels of physical
activity and intensity such as aerobic exercise, work-related
activities, gardening, walking, recreation, and leisure-time
activities. Average METs for walking = 3.3 METs, for mod-
erate activity = 4.0 METs, for vigorous activity = 8.0 METs.
The score expressed as MET-min per week was calculated
as (MET level × minutes of activity/day × days per week).
Total Physical Activity MET-minutes/week is obtained by
METs summation and categorized as inactive below 600
MET min/wk, minimally active and Health Enhancing
Physical Activity (HEPA) active.15
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the fre-
quency of different variables. The consumption of whole
grains (bread and bulgur), refined cereals (bread, rice, corn-
flakes, and macaroni), and legumes (lentils, green beans,
and peas) were computed in 2 ways. The first computation
was based on the frequency of consumption of each food
type (daily, weekly, monthly, and rarely). The second cate-
gory was based on the time that food usually consumed
(never, 1/4 the meals, 1/2 the meals, and all the meals).
Additionally, consumption was grouped into 2 separate cat-
egories based on the number of servings consumed daily:
1.0 serving per day and 2 servings per day. In all catego-
ries, the referent group had the lowest intake. Logistic
regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR), CI, linear
regression, and P value for trend with age (continuous), sex,
BMI (continuous), physical activity level (continuous),
total energy intake (continuous), red meat consumption,
occupation, education level, marital status, and family his-
tory for the CRC participants were evaluated as potential
confounders.17 Chi-square was used to detect the differ-
ences among categorical variables. The significance level
was set at P < .05. All statistical analyses were conducted in
SPSS version 19.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM
Corporation).
Results
Table 1 shows the distribution of risk factors for the study
participants. Colorectal cancer and control subjects were
matched for several parameters, including age, sex, occupa-
tion, and marital status. Table 2 shows the adjusted odds
ratio (AOR) and 95% CIs for whole grains and legumes.
The results obtained indicate that the risk for developing
CRC is significantly associated with consuming whole
grain versus refined breads at all meals. The OR for devel-
oping CRC among cases consuming refined wheat bread at
all meals was 3.1 compared with controls (95% CI: 1.2-7.9,
P
-Trend
= 0.001); whereas the OR associated with whole
wheat bread was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.22-0.92, P
-Trend
= 0.001).
Even though no significant association was observed
between refined bread consumption at any level and the risk
of having CRC, the trend of consumption was significant in
male participants (P
-Trend
= 0.030). A significant negative
association between CRC and the consumption of whole
wheat bread at all meals was observed in males with OR in
males at 0.37 (95% CI: 0.14-1.0, P
-Trend
= 0.004) as shown
in Table 3. This association was also observed in female

The results for those consuming rice daily also showed
an association with the risk of developing CRC, OR = 3.0
(95% CI: 0.27-33.4, P

= 0.021). Weekly consumption
of macaroni was associated with the risk of developing
CRC, OR = 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1-5.3, P

observation was true among females, OR = 6.1 (95% CI:
1.4-26.5, P
-Trend
= 0.003), but not in males (Table 3). In con-
trast, higher consumption of corn, bulgur, lentils, and peas
showed a protective trend against CRC development.
Discussion
The present study targeted the possible association between
cereals and legumes and risk of CRC development. Results
of this study indicated that higher consumption of refined
cereals and white bread is associated with higher CRC risk.
The current study also showed that higher intake of whole
grains and legumes is associated with lower risk for develop-
ing CRC. These findings are in agreement with observations
reported in previous studies conducted in Europe, South
America, and Asia18-22 in which researchers reported that the
risk for developing CRC was higher among individuals who
consumed their carbohydrates as rice, white bread, and pasta
as compared with individuals who consumed their carbohy-
drates as whole grain cereals.18-22 In a case-control study con-
ducted in northern Italy involving 339 cases of colon cancer,
236 cases of rectal cancer, and 778 controls, a positive asso-
ciation was observed with frequent consumption of starchy
food (pasta or rice) with relative risk of 3 for colon cancer
and 1.8 for rectal cancers in highest versus lowest tertiles.23
Another case-control study was conducted in Italy in that
regard involving 1953 cases (1125 men and 828 women)
with histologically confirmed incidences of cancer of the
colon or rectum and 4154 controls subjects (2073 men and
2081 women).24 Results showed a direct association with the
glycemic load (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5-2.2), and glycemic
index (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.4-2.0) in highest versus lowest
quintiles. Researchers interpreted their results through the
detrimental effect of refined carbohydrates in the etiology of
the CRC.24 In 1999, Chatenoud et al25 reported that consump-
tion of refined cereals was associated with higher risk of can-
cers of the large bowel with ORs for the highest tertile of
refined cereal intakes 1.5 for colon cancer and 1.3 for cancer
of the rectum.25 Asystematic review and dose-response meta-
analysis of prospective studies done by Aune et al26 showed
that the summary relative risk of developing CRC from con-
suming 10 g daily of total dietary fiber (n = 16 studies) was
0.90 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94), for legume fiber (n = 4 studies)
was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.27-1.42), for cereal fiber (n = 8 studies)
was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.83-0.97), and the relative risk for an
additional 3 servings daily of whole grains (n = 6 studies)
was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78-0.89).26
The protective effect of whole grains against risk of
developing CRC could be attributed to nutrients and phy-
tochemicals content of whole grains including dietary
fibers, resistant starch, oligosaccharides escaping from
digestion in the small intestine and then being fermented
in the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore,
whole grains are rich in antioxidants, including trace min-
erals and phenolic compounds. These phenolic compounds
may exert a preventive effect in the disease process.
Additionally, whole grains may mediate insulin and glu-
cose responses.27,28 Thus, refined grains and white bread
are classified as high glycemic index foods. Consuming
foods with high glycemic index may lead to chronic hyper-
glycemia and obesity-induced insulin resistance resulting
in hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia may stimulate
proliferation and promote metastasis of malignant colonic
epithelial cells by increasing the bioactivity of insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1).29-31 In contrast, results from a
cohort study involving Chinese women suggest that no
association exist between a diet characterized by high gly-
cemic index, glycemic load, or by a high intake of carbo-
hydrates with the risk of developing CRC.32
In an earlier study by Slattery et al,33 it was reported that
refined grain products were associated with higher risk of
40% overall, with a P value chi-square test for the threshold
effect of 0.01.33 There was also a significant interaction
between sex and refined grain intake (P < 0.05). While the
consumption of refined grains in men and women was found

to be associated with the risk of developing CRC (OR =
1.32, CI: 0.89-1.97 for men and OR = 1.58, CI: 0.96-2.58 for
women), the risk for CRC decreases with consumption of
whole grains OR = 0.67 (CI: 0.46-0.98) for men and OR =
0.74 (CI: 0.43-1.27) for women.33 Intake of whole grain
products was associated with a 30% reduced risk of rectal
cancer for both men and women combined; the intake of
whole grain products and sex was not significant (P < 0.27),
and the P value for the threshold effect was 0.03.33 These
results are in agreement with our results in which consuming
refined bread frequently was found to be associated signifi-
cantly with higher CRC risk (approximately 170%), while

consuming macaroni weekly was shown to be associated
with higher risk for CRC development significantly, 6 fold
in females (OR = 6.1). Egeberg et al34 conducted a cohort
study to investigate the association between consumption of
whole grain products and colon and rectal cancer.34 This

630 men and 29
189 women taking part in the
Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
of colon and rectal cancer related to total or individual whole
grain product intake were calculated using Cox regression.34
The results of the study revealed that higher whole grain
product intake was associated with lower risk of colon can-
cer and rectal cancer in men. The adjusted IRR (95% CI)
was 0.85 (0.77-0.94) for colon cancer and 0.90 (0.80-1.01)
for rectal cancer per daily 50-g increment in intake. For
colon cancer, the association was confined to intake of whole
grain bread, in particular. No consistent associations between
total or individual whole grain product consumption and
colon or rectal cancer risk were observed in women.34
A large population-based Scandinavian cohort study
consisting of 108
000 Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian
persons, of whom 1123 developed CRC during a median
of 11 years of follow-up was conducted to trace the asso-
ciation between the daily intake of whole grain products
(wheat, rye, and oats) and the incidence of CRC using
Cox proportional hazards models.35 Intake of whole grain
products was found to be associated with a lower inci-
dence of CRC per 50-g increment (IRR, 0.94; 95% CI:
0.89-0.99), and the same tendency was found for total
whole grain intake (IRR, 25-g increment, 0.94; 95% CI:
0.88-1.01). Intake of whole grain wheat was associated
with a lower incidence of CRC (IRR for highest vs lowest
quartile of intake, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.51-0.85), but no statis-
tical significant linear trend was observed (P
-Trend
= 0.18).
On the other hand, no significant association was found
for whole grain rye or oats.35 Contrary to the previous
studies, 1 recent study revealed that wheat class (red vs
white) and not the state of refinement (whole vs refined),
appears to influence colon cancer risk, with hard red
wheat protective relative to soft white wheat.36 Thus, epi-
demiological associations of reduced colon cancer risk
with whole grain consumption may actually reflect differ-
ent wheat classes.36 However, the only available and con-
sumed type of wheat in Jordan is red hard winter wheat
but still the incidence of CRC is increasing. One of the
suggested underlying mechanisms of action for the pro-
tective effect of whole grains against CRC is the effects
of fibers on reducing glycemic load and improving insu-
lin resistance, influenced by IGF-1.37 IGF-1 is known to
stimulate cell proliferation; increase production of vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic factor, which
supports tumor growth; and inhibit apoptosis in healthy
and cancerous colon epithelial cells as well.38
Study Limitations
Dietary recall data in cases may be different from controls
as data was collected after diagnosis of the disease.
Measuring dietary intakes using FFQ is vulnerable to
memory errors. However, using a validated FFQ may
decrease these possible errors. Nevertheless, the impact
of cooking on bioavailability of different nutrients was
not counted for. As with the other case control studies,
selection and recall biases may have affected the study
results. Selection bias may have affected the results as
controls were selected by convenience sampling from
hospital personnel, outpatients, visitors, and accompany-
ing persons and not from the general population. Finally,
the sample size is rather small, although the CRC cases
were recruited from 5 different large hospitals between
January 2010 and December 2012. And since Jordan is a
small country with an estimated population in 2009 that
reached 5
980
000, it was difficult to recruit more cases
given that the overall age-standardized incidence CRC
was found to be 17.3/100000 in 2009.
Conclusions
In conclusion, results of this study suggest that whole grains
and legumes may exert a protective effect against CRC
development. Because of the globalization and changes in
dietary patterns toward the western dietary pattern, whole
grains were replaced by refined cereals in Middle Eastern
countries. The present study shows how the type of cereal
consumed in Jordan and Middle Eastern countries could be
associated with developing CRC. These results may serve
as an additional encouragement in the development of
health promotional programs involving dietary factors as an
aid to reduce the risk of developing CRC in our Jordanian
population. Further studies are recommended to investigate
the findings of the current study.
