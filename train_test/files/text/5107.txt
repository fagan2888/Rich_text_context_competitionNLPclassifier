Abstract
Objectives: To measure levels of pain and iliac regeneration at the iliac crest donor site during a
10-year follow-up of graft patients.
Methods: This prospective study used a visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain at the donor
site at 1 month and 1, 3, 5 and 10 years postoperatively. Iliac regeneration status was recorded at 1,
3, 5, 7 and 10 years postoperatively by comparing plain radiographs.
Results: A total of 32 patients participated in the study. Mean VAS scores at 1 month, 1 year, 3, 5,
and 10 years were 3.22, 3.39, 3.45, 2.02 and 1.38, respectively. There was no statistically significant
difference between pain scores at 1 month and 1 year, but pairwise comparisons revealed
significant differences between the other timepoints. The mean iliac regeneration rank scores at 1,
3, 5, 7 and 10 years were 1.36, 2.22, 2.97, 3.75 and 4.70, respectively; all pairwise comparisons were
statistically significant.
Conclusion: The iliac donor site showed a declining trend in pain, which appeared to have started
3 years postoperatively. Long-term follow-up showed that the ilium is readily able to repair itself.

Introduction
Iliac graft harvesting is associated with
considerable postoperative pain and dis-
comfort.1 The pain at the donor site may
persist and represents a significant source of
postoperative morbidity. The incidence of
relevant pain after bone-graft harvesting
from the iliac crest at 3 months, 6 months
and 2 years is reportedly 29%, 38% and
19%, respectively.2,3 However, long-term

follow-up of the donor site has not extended
to 10 years.
The aim of the present study was to
describe the results of a 10-year follow-up of
the status of the iliac donor site, particularly
with respect to pain and bone regeneration.
Patients and methods
Study population
Adult patients scheduled to undergo inter-
nal fixation for various fractures using
autogenous bone grafts were sequentially
enrolled in this prospective study at the
Department of Orthopaedics, Third
Hospital of Hebei Medical University,
Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China
between January 2000 and December 2002.
Patients with an American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of
1 or 2, aged between 30 and 40 years, were
eligible for participation. Patients with mul-
tiple fractures, or fractures that required a
secondary operation for non-union, were
excluded from this study. Smokers were also
excluded from the study. Institutional ethics
committee approval was obtained from the
Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
Iliac crest bone harvesting
An autograft was harvested from the anter-
ior iliac crest in all patients. An incision of
nearly 7 cm in length was made just below
the anterior iliac wing, parallel to the iliac
crest and centred over the iliac tubercle.
Next, the skin was retracted to identify the
iliac crest, and a scalpel was used to create
an incision down onto the crest by stripping
off the muscle from either the inner or outer
wall of the ilium. Following the contour of
the bone, a sharp dissection was carefully
made to avoid straying out of the plane and
into the soft tissue. The dissection was
extended around the corner of the crest
onto the ilium using a Cobb elevator to
obtain a complete 3 Â 2 cm block of the
ilium. Dissection was very carefully per-
formed to avoid retraction of the inguinal
ligament and a resultant inguinal hernia.
The wound was irrigated with antibiotics
and saline, and soft tissue haemostasis
was achieved with bipolar cautery. The
wound was closed, and internal fixation of
the corresponding parts of the fracture
was performed. One dose of cefuroxime
(2.0 g) was given by intravenous administra-
tion preoperatively, followed by two add-
itional doses during the first 24 h
postoperatively.
Assessment of iliac pain and iliac bone
regeneration
Patients self-reported their pain using a
visual analogue scale (VAS; 0, no pain; 10,
worst pain imaginable) at 1 month and 1, 3,
5 and 10 years postoperatively. Plain radio-
graphs of the hip graft site were obtained
preoperatively and at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years
postoperatively, and the status of iliac
regeneration was determined by two senior
orthopaedic trauma physicians (L.Q. and
Y.Z.). The status of iliac regeneration was
divided into four levels, based on the com-
parison with plain preoperative radio-
graphs. At level I, the amount of new bone
volume was <30% of the original bone
volume; at level II, the amount of new
bone volume was !30% to 50% of its
original volume; at level III, the amount of
new bone volume was >50% to 70% of its
original volume; at level IV, the amount of
new bone volume was >70% of the original
bone volume. The levels of iliac regeneration
(I­IV) were given the rank scores of 1, 2, 3
and 4, respectively.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package,
Qi et al. 1349
version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
for WindowsÕ.
The Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-
rank test were used to generate mean rank
scores.
A P-value of <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
Thirty-six patients were asked to participate;
four patients declined. The mean age of the
patients (20 male, 12 female) was 33 years
(range 31­39 years). The ASA physical
status of 30 patients was level 1, and that
of two patients was level 2 because of
controlled hypertension. Of the 32 patients,
the autologous iliac crest bone of seven
patients was used for humeral shaft fracture
transplantation, that of 20 patients was used
for femoral shaft fracture transplantation,
that of three patients was used for tibial
shaft fracture transplantation, and that of
two patients was used for radial and ulnar
fracture transplantation. No postoperative
infections occurred in any patient. All frac-
tures had healed by 9 months postopera-
tively (range 6­13 months). All patients
returned to their previous activities or
occupations.
Results of the iliac regeneration status
analysis, including mean rank scores for iliac
regeneration at different timepoints over the
study period, are shown in Table 1. Pairwise
comparison using Wilcoxon signed-rank test
(a0 ¼ 0.005) showed that all postoperative
comparisons (1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years) were
statistically significant compared with the
preoperative bone volume (P < 0.001 for all
comparisons). After 10 years, the amount of
new bone in seven patients was >70% of the
original bone volume (level IV iliac regener-
ation; Table 1).
Results of the VAS scoring for pain at the
donor site are shown in Table 2. The mean
VAS scores at 1 month and 1, 3, 5 and 10
years were 3.22, 3.39, 3.45, 2.02 and 1.38,
respectively. Pairwise comparison using
Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a0 ¼ 0.005)
showed no statistically significant difference
between 1 month and 1 year. However, there
were statistically significant differences
between the other pairwise comparisons
(P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
Discussion
Iliac crest autografting is considered to be
the gold standard grafting technique in
fracture internal fixation procedures and in
some spinal fusion surgeries.1 Harvesting of
the iliac crest graft is associated with mor-
bidity, particularly persistent pain at the
graft harvest site, in up to one-third of
patients.4,5 However, the most recent studies
have reported incidences of relevant pain
with a follow-up of 3 years.5

The present study is is the first prospect-
ive study to examine pain and bone regen-
eration with a follow-up of 10 years. In this
study, we found that pain was significantly
lower 3 years postoperatively compared
with 1 year postoperatively. This reduction
in pain was primarily exhibited because
fewer patients reported severe pain as the
postoperative time increased. This result
may affect the number of orthopaedic sur-
geons who propose reconstruction of the
iliac crest to reduce pain.
Several methods to reduce graft site
pain are currently available. For example,
Tanishima et al.6 recommended rounding
off the graft harvest site edges.
Reconstruction of the graft site with resorb-
able mesh has been shown to reduce early
postoperative pain.7 Continuous application
of 0.2% ropivacaine through an iliac crest
catheter with iliac crest bone grafting was
demonstrated to be an effective method for
pain relief for the first 48 h, and the benefit of
this technique was still present after
3 months.8 However, most of these were
retrospective studies with shorter follow-up
times, which seriously affected their cred-
ibility. This present study revealed a declin-
ing trend in pain, which appeared to have
started 3 years postoperatively, suggesting
that pain relief does not require ilium
reconstruction.
This present study also observed the
phenomenon of bone regeneration. The
results demonstrated that the ilium exhibited
a good ability to repair itself in the long term.
This was perhaps related to the choice of
patients, who were younger people (aged
30­40 years) with fractures and no med-
ical comorbidities (ASA physical status of
1 or 2). This present study selected younger
rather than older patients with spinal dis-
eases to ensure successful completion of a 10-
year follow-up; thus, the extent of iliac
regeneration may have been exaggerated in
this study. This present study sought to
determine whether bone regrowth at the
harvest site was associated with pain relief,
but it was unable to determine this because
the sample size was too small. This problem
requires further investigation in a multi-
centre prospective study with a larger
sample size.
In conclusion, this present study demon-
strated that the iliac crest bone graft donor
site showed a declining trend in pain over the
follow-up period, which may have started at
3 years postoperatively. Analysis of plain
radiographs demonstrated that the ilium
was readily able to repair itself over the
long term.
