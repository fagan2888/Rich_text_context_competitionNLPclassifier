Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Peripheral Arterial
Disease in the United States
Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
1999­2000
Elizabeth Selvin, MPH; Thomas P. Erlinger, MD, MPH
Background--Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is an important
marker of subclinical coronary heart disease. However, estimates of PAD prevalence in the general US population have
varied widely.
Methods and Results--We analyzed data from 2174 participants aged 40 years and older from the 1999­2000 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.90 in either leg. The
prevalence of PAD among adults aged 40 years and over in the United States was 4.3% (95% CI 3.1% to 5.5%), which
corresponds to 5 million individuals (95% CI 4 to 7 million). Among those aged 70 years or over, the prevalence was
14.5% (95% CI 10.8% to 18.2%). In age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression analyses, black race/ethnicity (OR
2.83, 95% CI 1.48 to 5.42) current smoking (OR 4.46, 95% CI 2.25 to 8.84), diabetes (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.12),
hypertension (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.13), hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.57), and low kidney
function (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.70) were positively associated with prevalent PAD. More than 95% of persons with
PAD had 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. Elevated fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels were also
associated with PAD.
Conclusions--This study provides nationally representative prevalence estimates of PAD in the United States, revealing
that PAD affects more than 5 million adults. PAD prevalence increases dramatically with age and disproportionately
affects blacks. The vast majority of individuals with PAD have 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors that should
be targeted for therapy. (Circulation. 2004;110:738-743.)
Key Words: peripheral arterial disease  epidemiology  risk factors
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) commonly results from
progressive narrowing of arteries in the lower extremi-
ties, due to atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that
PAD is associated with a significantly elevated risk of
cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.1­3 However,
estimates of PAD prevalence in the general US population
have varied widely. Despite using similar diagnostic criteria,
prior estimates of PAD prevalence in the United States have
ranged from 3% to 30% in US adult populations.4­10
The risk for short-term cardiovascular ischemic events is a
major concern for persons with PAD. Indeed, major risk
factors for PAD include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
diabetes, and smoking. In addition, limb amputation, a
frequent clinical complication of PAD, is common among
individuals with kidney disease11,12 and diabetes.13 Recent
studies have also shown positive associations between PAD
and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein
(CRP) and fibrinogen.14,15
The present study was undertaken (1) to assess the preva-
lence of PAD among the general US adult population, (2) to
assess the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among
individuals with PAD, and (3) to determine the associations
between hypothesized PAD risk factors and the prevalence of
PAD in the US adult population. Prevalence estimates from
this study are nationally representative of the noninstitution-
alized population of adults aged 40 years and over in the
United States.
Methods
Study Population
This study was based on data from the 1999­2000 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), an ongoing cross-
sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of
the United States. Detailed in-person interviews, physical examina-
tions, and serum samples were obtained from more than 9000
persons in the 1999­2000 survey. Valid information on mean
ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) was available for 2381

individuals aged 40 years (83% of eligible persons). We excluded
6 participants with ABI values 1.5, values usually related to
noncompressible vessels in the legs,16 and 228 participants (10%)
with missing variables of interest, which left 2174 individuals in the
present study.
Outcome
PAD can be determined with high sensitivity and specificity using
the ABI, a simple, noninvasive procedure.17­19 We defined PAD on
the basis of ABI measurements obtained from NHANES 1999­2000
participants aged 40 years during the examination component of
the survey. Systolic blood pressure was measured on the right arm
(brachial artery) and both ankles (posterior tibial arteries). If the
participant had a condition associated with the right arm that would
interfere with measurement, the left arm was used for brachial
pressure measurement. Systolic blood pressure was measured twice
at each site for participants aged 40 to 59 years and once at each site
for participants aged 60 years. Left and right ABI measurements
were obtained by dividing mean systolic blood pressure in the right
and left ankle by mean blood pressure in the arm. PAD was defined
as an ABI 0.90 in either leg.
Other Variables of Interest
Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure of
140 mm Hg or greater, mean diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg
or greater, physician diagnosis, or medication use. Mean blood
pressure was composed of up to 4 readings on 2 separate occasions.
Total cholesterol was measured enzymatically.20 Hypercholesterol-
emia was defined as a total cholesterol level 240 mg/dL or higher,
physician diagnosis, or medication use. Diabetes was defined as
self-reported physician diagnosis, use of diabetes medication, fasting
glucose of 126 mg/dL, or nonfasting glucose of 200 mg/dL.
Persons reporting "borderline diabetes" or solely reporting a diabetes
diagnosis during pregnancy were considered nondiabetic.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function,
was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
Study formula21 based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and race. To
appropriately estimate GFR, serum creatinine was calibrated to
account for laboratory differences between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2000.22 Failure to account for laboratory differ-
ences would lead to an overestimate of the prevalence of PAD
among persons with low GFR. Kidney function was categorized on
the basis of the classification system established by the National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative.21
Normal kidney function was defined as a GFR 90 mL · min1 ·
1.73 m2; a GFR of 60 to 90 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2 was considered
mildly decreased kidney function, and a GFR 60 mL · min1 · 1.73
m2 was considered low kidney function. There were too few
individuals in the severely decreased GFR group (GFR 30 mL ·
min1 · 1.73 m2) to include these persons in a separate category.
Fibrinogen was measured quantitatively by the Clauss clotting
method.20 High-sensitivity CRP was measured with a Behring
Nephelometer II Analyzer.20 In analyses, both fibrinogen and CRP
were categorized into quartiles. Body mass index (BMI) was
estimated by dividing kilograms of weight by height in meters
squared and was categorized according to the classification system
established by the National Institutes of Health (25, 25.0 to 30, and
30.0 kg/m2).23
Information on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and smoking was
based on self-report during the questionnaire portion of the survey.
Smoking status was determined using answers to the questions,
"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?" and "Do you
now smoke cigarettes?" During the interview, participants were also
asked questions about their history of cardiovascular disease. For the
purposes of the present study, prevalent coronary heart disease was
defined as self-reported coronary heart disease or previous heart
attack. Congestive heart failure and stroke were also defined on the
basis of self-report.
Detailed information about data collection in NHANES 1999­
2000 is available elsewhere.20
Statistical Analysis
The NHANES surveys are ongoing complex, multistage probability
samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United
States. The NHANES 1999­2000 survey oversampled the elderly,
low-income persons, adolescents, Mexican Americans, and non-
Hispanic blacks to provide more reliable estimates for these popu-
lation subgroups.
Analyses were performed with SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute
Inc) and SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute) to obtain
unbiased estimates from the complex NHANES sampling design.
Standard errors for all estimates were obtained by the jackknife
"leave-one-out" method. Adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs were
estimated with logistic regression models.
Results
Prevalence of PAD
The prevalence of PAD among individuals aged 40 years
was 4.3% (95% CI 3.1% to 5.5%). Thus, in 2000, there were
5 million adults (95% CI 4 to 7 million) aged 40 years
who would be classified as having PAD on the basis of an
ABI 0.90. The Figure shows the prevalence of PAD by
gender and age groups. The prevalence of PAD dramatically
increased with advancing age in both sexes. The overall
prevalence of PAD among individuals aged 70 years was
14.5% (95% CI 10.8% to 18.2%), which corresponds to 4
million individuals (95% CI 3 to 5 million). Table 1 shows
the prevalence of PAD by selected population characteristics.
No clear gender differences in PAD prevalence were
observed.

The prevalence of PAD among non-Hispanic blacks was
7.9% (95% CI 5.2% to 10.6%), the highest among all
race/ethnic groups. Prevalent PAD was associated with smok-
ing status, with a prevalence of 6.8% (95% CI 3.7% to 9.9%)
among current smokers compared with 4.4% (95% CI 2.8%
to 6.0%) among former smokers and only 3.1% (95% CI
1.7% to 4.5%) in never-smokers. Among individuals with
diabetes, 10.8% (95% CI 3.2% to 18.4%) had PAD compared
with 3.6% (95% CI 2.2% to 5.0%) of individuals without
diabetes. The prevalence of PAD among persons with low
kidney function (GFR 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2) was 18.2%
(95% CI 9.2% to 27.2%). The prevalence of PAD among
individuals self-reporting a history of cardiovascular disease
(coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, or stroke)
was 12.9% (95% CI 7.6% to 18.2%).
Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and PAD
Table 2 shows the distribution of cardiovascular disease risk
factors among those individuals with and without PAD. The
prevalence of "traditional" cardiovascular disease risk factors
such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking
was high among persons with PAD. More than 60% (95% CI
52% to 70%) of individuals with PAD had hypercholesterol-
emia, 74% (95% CI 64% to 83%) were hypertensive, 26%
(95% CI 10% to 43%) had diabetes, and 33% (95% CI 22%
to 44%) were current smokers. Approximately 95% (95% CI
90% to 100%) had at least 1 of these cardiovascular disease
risk factors, and 72% (95% CI 63% to 80%) had 2 or more
risk factors (analysis not shown). The overall prevalence of
self-reported cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease,
congestive heart failure, and/or stroke) was 33% (95% CI
24% to 43%) among persons with PAD.
Risk Factors for PAD
The adjusted and unadjusted ORs of prevalent PAD accord-
ing to selected risk factors are presented in Table 3. In age-
and gender-adjusted analysis, individuals of non-Hispanic
black race/ethnicity were 3 times as likely as their non-
Hispanic white counterparts to have prevalent PAD (OR 2.83,
95% CI 1.48 to 5.42). The OR remained significant even after
further adjustment for smoking status, BMI, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and GFR (OR 2.39, 95% CI
1.11 to 5.12).
In age- and gender-adjusted analyses, traditional risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease were associated with PAD.
Current smoking (OR 4.46, 95% CI 2.25 to 8.84), diabetes
(OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.12), and self-reported cardiovas-
cular disease (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.42) were highly
associated with prevalent PAD. Hypertension and hypercho-
lesterolemia were positively associated with PAD, with ORs
of 1.75 (95% CI, 0.97 to 3.15) and 1.68 (95% CI 1.09 to
2.57), respectively. These ORs were only slightly attenuated
after multivariable adjustment (Table 3).
Low kidney function was highly associated with PAD.
After multivariable adjustment, individuals with low kidney
function were twice as likely to have prevalent PAD (OR
2.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.30). These data provided no evidence
that BMI was associated with prevalent PAD.

Inflammation and PAD
In gender- and age-adjusted analyses (not shown), both CRP
(P for trend 0.01) and fibrinogen (P for trend 0.01) were
associated with prevalent PAD. After adjustment for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and BMI, the ORs of
PAD comparing quartiles 2 through 4 of CRP with the lowest
quartiles were 0.81 (95% CI 0.33 to 2.02), 1.26 (95% CI 0.49
to 3.25), and 1.72 (95% CI 0.74 to 3.99), respectively (P for
trend 0.05). In a model adjusted for the same risk factors,
the ORs of PAD comparing quartiles 2 through 4 of fibrin-
ogen with the lowest quartiles were 0.46 (95% CI 0.26 to
1.90), 1.48 (95% CI 0.54 to 4.01), and 1.68 (95% CI 0.67 to
4.23), respectively (P for trend 0.05).
Discussion
This study reports nationally representative estimates of PAD
in the US adult population. These results show that PAD
affects 5 million US adults. As the US population ages,
PAD is likely to become an increasing problem. If risk factors
remain stable, we expect an estimated 7 million individuals
aged 40 years and over will have PAD by the year 2020,
according to census population projections.24
Previous prevalence estimates for PAD have largely de-
rived from studies of subjects from clinical settings, which
would be expected to overestimate the burden of disease in
the general population. Compared with the prevalence esti-
mates from NHANES 1999­2000 presented here, recent
reports have overstated the prevalence of PAD in the United
States by a factor of 2 to 3,4­6,9,10,25 despite using similar
diagnostic criteria. The prevalence estimates and risk factor
associations in the present study are consistent with those
observed among middle-aged adults in US community-based
studies, such as the Framingham Offspring Study7 and the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study,8 and among
elderly individuals in the Honolulu Heart Program26 and the
Cardiovascular Health Study.2 The prevalence of PAD in
these other studies, which used similar diagnostic criteria,
ranged from 3% to 4% among middle-aged adults and
between 13% and 14% in the elderly.
The results of the present study show that PAD dispropor-
tionately affects older individuals and non-Hispanic blacks.
The excess PAD prevalence among blacks was not explained
by known risk factors for PAD. This is consistent with
previous studies that have shown a higher prevalence of PAD
in non-Hispanic blacks.27 We also demonstrate that there is a
particularly high prevalence of PAD among current smokers,
diabetics, and persons with low kidney function.
PAD is also highly associated with traditional cardiovas-
cular disease risk factors such as current smoking, diabetes,
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, with 95% of persons
with prevalent PAD having at least 1 of these risk factors.
Nontraditional risk factors were also associated with preva-
lent PAD. Both fibrinogen and CRP were positively associ-
ated with prevalent PAD after adjustment for potential
confounders. Although these findings might suggest a causal
role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of PAD, they may
also reflect a high burden of atherosclerosis in individuals
with PAD.
The rigorous methodology used in NHANES provides
nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of PAD
and its risk factors. Moreover, NHANES 1999­2000 was the
first NHANES survey to perform ankle-brachial blood pres-
sure measurements on participants and hence allows for
direct comparison with prior prevalence studies in adult

populations. Despite these strengths, several limitations de-
serve consideration. It is possible that the prevalence of PAD
in the present study underestimates the true prevalence in the
population. The use of a different cutpoint for ABI and/or the
inclusion of measurements from the anterior tibial arteries
might have resulted in a greater sensitivity. However, the
magnitude of this problem is likely to be small because the
sensitivity of our definition has been shown to be 90% in
other studies.17­19 Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of
NHANES limits conclusions about direction or causality
of associations observed in the present study. The use of
self-reported data for some risk factors could underestimate
prevalence, especially for health conditions such as coronary
heart disease. Furthermore, this study may be subject to
"survival bias," in that individuals with chronic disease or
severe risk factors may be less likely to participate in
NHANES. However, this form of selection bias is likely to
underestimate observed associations between risk factors and

PAD, especially for conditions associated with poor physical
functioning and comorbidities such as kidney disease.
In summary, these results demonstrate that 5 million
adults aged 40 years have PAD and that PAD dispropor-
tionately affects older age individuals, non-Hispanic blacks,
current smokers, diabetics, and persons with reduced kidney
function. In addition, there is a high prevalence of traditional
and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors among persons
with PAD. More than 95% of individuals with PAD have at
least 1 traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and the majority
have multiple risk factors. These findings highlight the
importance of aggressive risk factor management in persons
with PAD and in those at increased risk for PAD.
