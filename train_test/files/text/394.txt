HMO Coverage Reduces Variations
In The Use Of Health Care Among
Patients Under Age Sixty-Five
ABSTRACT Variation in the use of hospital and physician services among
Medicare beneficiaries is well documented. However, less is known about
the younger, commercially insured population. Using data from the
Community Tracking Study to investigate this issue, we found significant
variation in the use of both inpatient and outpatient services across
twelve metropolitan areas. HMO insurance reduces, but does not
eliminate, the extent of this variation. Our results suggest that health
plan spending to better organize delivery systems and manage care may
be efficient, and regulations that arbitrarily cap plans' spending on
administration, such as minimum medical loss ratios, could undermine
efforts to achieve better value in health care.
For more than twenty years, the Dart-
mouth Atlas of Health Care has docu-
mented two striking facts. First,
Medicare spending and treatment
decisions vary greatly across geo-
graphic areas, even after differences in benefici-
aries' age, health status, and cost of living are
adjusted for.1 Second, this variation in the use of
health care resources is not always positively
correlated with variation in quality or health out-
comes.2,3 This body of work forms the basis for
the view that there are major inefficiencies in
health care delivery.4
Unanswered Questions
Despite the importance of this research to health
policy, it has left several questions unanswered.
Studying Broader Populations First, al-
most all of the Dartmouth Atlas work has exam-
ined health care resource use by people age sixty-
five and older, and a substantial portion focuses
further on chronically ill older adults. Much less
attention has been paid to the care of relatively
healthy, younger people. As Laurence Baker and
colleagues have observed, evidence of variations
in treatment in a broader population of patients
imply that the opportunities for improving effi-
ciency are even greater than the Dartmouth Atlas
and associated research suggest.5
Improving Efficiency Second, although
existing work highlights which geographic areas
offer opportunities for efficiency improvement,
it generally does not identify a mechanism for
obtaining such improvements. Knowing which
areas are high-use is necessary, but not suffi-
cient, for reducing use in high-use areas. Two
recent papers suggest that managed care might
serve this role.5,6 However, neither explicitly
quantifies or tests the extent of the effect of man-
aged care on area variation.
Purpose Of Paper This paper seeks to fill
these gaps. We used data from the Community
Tracking Study (CTS) to estimate the extent of
area variation in inpatient and outpatient ser-
vices in twelve US metropolitan areas.
We found that health maintenance organiza-
tion (HMO) insurance is associated with reduc-
tions in variation in medical but not surgical
hospital admissions, and in emergency depart-
ment but not ordinary physician visits. Interest-
ingly, we also found that HMO insurance
reduces variation among people under age 45,
but not among people ages 45­64.7 As we explain

below, these findings provide insight into how
HMO coverage might affect variation.
This paper also contributes to the literature on
how managed care affects the efficiency of care
delivery. Most existing work quantifies the effect
of such coverage by estimating its effects on mea-
sures of resource use and health outcomes.8 In-
vestigating how managed care affects area
variations is an alternative approach.
Study Data And Methods
Data We used data from the CTS, a large-scale
longitudinal survey designed to track health in-
surance coverage and use of health services by
individual households in sixty US communities.
Twelve large metropolitan areas, with popula-
tions greater than 200,000 and with repre-
sentative survey samples large enough to draw
conclusions about each area, were randomly se-
lected to be studied in depth.9,10
We used the 1997­98 and 1998­99 waves of the
Community Tracking Survey, which included a
Followback Survey that provided details about
the surveyed population's private health insur-
ance policies.11 We used these early waves be-
cause the data, although more than a decade
old, have several unique features that make them
ideally suited to examining the question of area
variation. Later waves either do not include a
Followback Survey or do not support commu-
nity-level analyses, or both, and we are not aware
of any other, more recent data that do.
The survey distinguished among four types of
insurance: HMO, preferred provider organiza-
tion, point-of-service, and fee-for-service. We
grouped the latter three together as "unman-
aged" insurance. Our pooled 1997­98/1998­99
analysis sample contains 26,766 people younger
than age sixty-five with private insurance, of
whom 10,857 have HMO insurance and 15,909
have unmanaged insurance.
Analysis We began our analysis by comparing
hospital admission rates among people age sixty-
five and older in the Community Tracking Sur-
vey, where data are self-reported, and perhaps
underreported, to similar estimates from the
Dartmouth Atlas, which is based on Medicare
claims data. The Dartmouth Atlas therefore pro-
vides a useful validity check of the CTS data, at
least for elderly beneficiaries.
We found that the correlation between the
number of hospital admissions per elderly Medi-
care beneficiary--excluding those in Medicare
Advantage plans--in the twelve CTS commun-
ities and the number of admissions per person
for these twelve areas reported in the Dartmouth
Atlas for 1999 is high (correlation coefficient
 ¼ 0:79).12 The means of the two series are also
very close: Weighted by population, the mean
rate of hospitalization is 0.377 in the CTS data
and 0.340 from the Dartmouth Atlas data.
The remainder of our analysis focused on pri-
vately insured people younger than age sixty-
five. We measured area variation with the coef-
ficient of variation--the ratio of the standard
deviation across areas of the use of a health ser-
vice, such as hospital admissions per capita, to
the mean. Higher values of the coefficient of
variation imply more variation.
One important feature of the coefficient of
variation is that it measures the spread of a dis-
tribution without regard to the units in which the
distribution is denominated (for example, days
in the hospital, number of physician visits). For
this reason, it is comparable across different
types of services. We calculated the coefficient
of variation of four types of services: surgical
hospital admissions (admissions for a surgical
procedure), medical hospital admissions (ad-
missions for reasons other than a surgical pro-
cedure), physician office visits, and emergency
department (ED) visits.
For each type of service, we compared the
coefficient of variation for people with HMO in-
surance to that of people with unmanaged insur-
ance. For all four services, the coefficient of
variation for people with HMO insurance was
lower than that for people with unmanaged in-
surance. Then, we formally tested whether varia-
tion in use across areas differed between the two
groups. For two of the four services, we found the
difference in coefficients of variation to be sta-
tistically significant.
Study Results
Exhibits 1­3 present the extent to which area
variation in four measures of utilization differs
for people younger than age sixty-five who have
unmanaged versus HMO insurance.13 Each point
on each exhibit represents the average number
of admissions or visits per person in one study
area, adjusted for differences across areas in
race, sex, age, and household income.14
In exhibit Notes, we report the coefficient of
variation across areas and the mean level of use
for people with each type of insurance. Because
the CTS is only a sample, estimates of the coef-
ficient of variation for people with unmanaged
versus HMO insurance may differ as a result of
chance variation rather than of true differences
in the underlying populations. To enable readers
to evaluate whether estimated differences are
statistically significant--that is, not due to
chance--we report p values from hypothesis tests
of the equality of coefficients of variation be-
tween people with each type of insurance.15

Medical And Surgical Admissions Exhibits 1
and 2 show the average level and the extent of
variation across areas in the number of medical
and surgical hospital admissions per person, re-
spectively, for people with different types of in-
surance. The exhibits show that more area
variation exists among people with unmanaged
than HMO insurance in both medical and surgi-
cal admissions.
The coefficient of variation of the rate of medi-
cal hospital admissions for people with unman-
aged insurance is 0.294; for those with HMO
insurance, it is less than half as great (0.142).
The coefficients of variation of the rate of surgi-
cal admissions are closer together (Exhibit
2 Notes).
We rejected the hypothesis of equality of coef-
ficients of variation across insurance types at
conventional significance levels for medical ad-
missions (p ¼ 0:027), but not surgical admis-
sions (p ¼ 0:216).
Emergency Department Visits Exhibit 3
shows the analogous statistics for the number
of emergency department visits. Among people
with unmanagedinsurance, thereis significantly
greater variation across areas in outpatient ser-
vices use. As above, we rejected the hypothesis of
equality of coefficients of variation across insur-
ance types at conventional levels (p ¼ 0:016).
Interesting Regularities Although the sys-
tematic differences in area variation across in-
surance status are striking, Exhibits 1­3 also
reveal other interesting regularities in the sourc-
es and types of area differences in patterns of
care. First is the extent to which the Miami met-
ropolitan area is an outlier in hospital use
(Exhibit 1). Indeed, for people with unmanaged
private insurance, the per capita medical hospi-
tal admission rate in Miami (0.139) is almost
twice as great as the next-highest area, Cincin-
nati (0.080).
Second, even though HMO coverage does re-
duce variation in the use of services across areas,
it does not come close to eliminating it. For ex-
ample, among people with unmanaged insur-
ance, the number of ED visits per person in
the highest-use community, Boston, is almost
double thenumber in thelowest-usecommunity,
Seattle. But even among people with HMO in-
surance, the number of ED visits in the highest-
use community, again Boston, is still 69 percent
larger than the number in the lowest-use com-
munity, Syracuse.
Third, although areas that are high-use on
one dimension are in some cases high-use on
others--such as Boston, which ranks persist-
ently high on the use of all four services--overall,
the ordering of areas by utilization rates is not
very consistent across measures. For example,

the correlation between the area rankings of
medical and surgical admissions among people
with unmanaged insurance is actually negative
( ¼ -0:385). The correlation between the area
rankings of physician and ED visits among peo-
ple with unmanaged insurance is weakly positive
( ¼ 0:021). Correlations between area rankings
of service use for people with HMO insurance
show a similar pattern.
Physician Visits We also analyzed the extent
of variation across areas in the number and level
of physician visits (results available in the Online
Appendix).16 We found that people with unman-
aged insurance had greater variation in physi-
cian visits across areas (coefficient of variation
for unmanaged, 0.078, versus HMO, 0.061). The
difference between those with unmanaged and
HMO insurance was not statistically significant
(p ¼ 0:139). However, people with HMO insur-
ance had higher levels of visits that were statisti-
cally significant (3.731 versus 3.584 visits, p
value of the difference ¼ 0:016). For the other
three measures, average use was statistically in-
distinguishable by insurance type.
This finding is consistent with previous analy-
ses of data from the Community Tracking Study17
and with comparisons between HMO and un-
managed insurance more generally.18 There are
at most modest differences in the use of broad
categories of services by insurance type.
Additional Evidence Exhibit 4 provides fur-
ther evidence that type of insurance affects area
variations. It plots hospital admissions per eld-
erly Medicare beneficiary, excluding those en-
rolled in Medicare Advantage, in each of the
twelve areas against admissions per person
under age sixty-five with HMO insurance (de-

noted by red circles) and unmanaged insurance
(denoted by blue squares).
The exhibit shows that Medicare admission
rates are negatively correlated, albeit weakly,
with admission rates for people younger
than age sixty-five with HMO insurance
( ¼ -0:03). Medicare admission rates are pos-
itively correlated, and more strongly, with ad-
mission rates for people under age sixty-five
with unmanaged insurance ( ¼ 0:40). These re-
lationships are consistent with HMO coverage
having a causal effect on the extent of variation.
The area variation of younger people with un-
managed insurance--that is, insurance resem-
bling fee-for-service Medicare--looks like the
area variation for Medicare beneficiaries. In con-
trast, the area variation of younger people with
HMO insurance does not.
Exhibit 5 presents results that suggest how
HMO coverage reduces area variation. It
presents coefficients of variation for each of
the four measures of use that we studied, by
patient age group and insurance type. Reduc-
tions in area variation associated with managed
care are concentrated mainly among younger
people. For three of the four measures, people
younger than age forty-five with HMO insurance
have statistically significant lower coefficients of
variation across areas (p < 0:10) than the same
age group with unmanaged insurance. In con-
trast, there are no statistically significant differ-
ences among people ages 45­64.
Discussion
Prior research has documented dramatic differ-
ences across geographic areas in the intensity of
medical treatment received.1 This work, how-
ever, has focused on the aged Medicare popula-
tion and people with chronic illnesses. It has also
not explicitly evaluated whether and how man-
aged care affects geographic variations.
New Findings We present three new findings.
First, there is significant variation across areas,
even among a relatively healthy commercially
insured population under age sixty-five. Second,
HMO insurance reduces the extent of this varia-
tion but does not eliminate it. Third, the effect of
managed care on variation seems to come
through the younger segment of this population.
This is important because younger people tend
to be in better--and less variable--health than
their older peers,19 so variation in the younger
subpopulation is less likely to be attributable to
their underlying medical conditions.
Limitations Our study has two important lim-
itations. First, the data that we used are more
than a decade old. Second, those data did not
allow us to identify the consequences of area
variation for health outcomes. If the greater
health services intensity in high-use areas leads
to better health or to greater benefits for patients
through some other path, then reduction in
variation--and, by implication, the role of man-
aged care--might not be socially beneficial.
However, as other researchers have observed,
finding significant geographic area variation in
medical care invites closer scrutiny of what is
causing the variation. Differences across areas
in utilization that are not associated with pop-
ulation characteristics or quality of care are
likely to behallmarks of an inefficienthealth care
system. The fact that the reduction in variation
that we observed came through the effects of

HMO coverage on patients under age forty-five
further reinforces this conclusion.
In this population, the hypothesis that man-
aged care reduces inappropriate use, and there-
fore improves efficiency, is especially plausible.
HMO coverage may also encouragemorepreven-
tive activities in this relatively healthy group.
Policy Implications Our results have impor-
tant implications for health policy. They suggest
that health plans' expenditure of resources to
better organize delivery systems and manage
care may be efficient; this is consistent with
the findings from other recent work on area var-
iations.20
To the extent that this is true, regulations that
arbitrarily cap plans' spending on administra-
tion, such as minimum medical loss ratios,21
could end up being socially harmful if they have
the effect of restricting beneficial management
and administration activities. (Editors' note: As
of publication of this article, however, the Na-
tional Association of Insurance Commissioners,
at the request of the secretary of health and hu-
man services, has proposed language in the
forthcoming federal regulation governing medi-
cal loss ratios that would classify such activities
as "expenses to improve health care quality," and
therefore not administrative. It is unknown
whether or not this classification will govern
the final regulation, or whether there may still
be ongoing uncertainty as to the appropriate
classification of such activities.)
Our results also suggest that the managed care
backlash of the 1990s, and the subsequent shift
toward more unmanaged insurance in the pri-
vate sector, may inadvertently have perpetuated
the problem of inefficient area variation.
Although our results do not imply that HMO
coverage alone is the answer--we did still ob-
serve variation even for patients with HMO cov-
erage--policy reforms that support the use of
highly managed care may be an important part
of the solution to the area-variation puzzle.

14 For our comparisons of people with
unmanaged and HMO insurance, we
risk-adjusted the area-level measures
of utilization for differences across
areas in the race, sex, age, and in-
come of the population. This risk-
adjustment method had three steps.
First, we ran individual-level re-
gressions, separately for people with
HMO and unmanaged insurance, of
utilization on race, sex, area fixed
effects, and categorical variables for
age and household income. Second,
we calculated what each area's re-
gression-adjusted utilization would
be if it had the national average race,
sex, age, and income distribution.
Third, we calculated the coefficient
of variation of this regression-
adjusted utilization across areas.
15 To calculate the p values, we used the
following two-step method. First, we
replaced each person's actual uti-
lization with his or her predicted
utilization from the regression in
step 1 in Note 14 plus a bootstrapped
residual from this regression, drawn
with replacement separately for each
of the twelve geographic areas. Sec-
