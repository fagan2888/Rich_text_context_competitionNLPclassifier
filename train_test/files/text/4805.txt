Accreditation
Introduction
Those employed in nursing education will easily recognize
the sense of anxiety that accompanies the preparation of a
self-study or site visit for accreditation. The knowledge of
the time commitment required and the importance of posi-
tive outcomes for a nursing program can result in sleepless
nights and long days for those involved in preparing for
accreditation. The accreditation process requires signifi-
cant self-assessment and peer evaluation; this process
results in ensuring the quality of a nursing program and
identifying areas of improvement. In addition, the program
evaluation data need to be collected on a regular basis
(Lewallen, 2015). An ongoing course of action assists fac-
ulty and administration with engagement and enhances the
environment for quality improvement over time (Ellis &
Halstead, 2012). Promotion of faculty engagement and
knowledge of components of the accreditation process such
as curricular review is paramount to the necessity of the
continuous process and the ownership by the faculty
(Dearmon, Lawson, & Hall, 2011). The purpose of this arti-
cle is to describe the challenge of and practical approaches
to the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education
(CCNE) accreditation and/or Continuous Improvement
Progress Report (CIPR) processes. From this description,
other universities, schools of nursing, or departments can
utilize the approaches in their accreditation practices.
Beginning in 2008, the CCNE offered a 10-year accredi-
tation with a CIPR due at the 5-year mark. Our school of
nursing (SON) received a 10-year accreditation in 2009, with
an interim report due in December 2014. While much prepa-
ration, energy, and time are usually placed on the process and
writing of the self-study, the "interim reporting that is
required in between the comprehensive site visit may be less
understood" (Ellis & Halstead, 2012, p. 18). And in similar
fashion to many nursing programs, thoughts of accreditation
were placed on the "back burner" while dealing with changes
in our SON. The process of preparing and writing the CIPR
provides an opportunity for program evaluation in determin-
ing the most successful activities that will expedite the
"ongoing continuous quality improvement (CQI)" necessary
to support the CCNE standards (Ellis & Halstead, 2012,

Abstract
The accreditation process of a nursing program requires self-assessment, peer evaluation, and identifying areas of
improvement. In 2008, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) began offering a 10-year accreditation
with a Continuous Improvement Progress Report (CIPR) at the fifth year. This article focuses on an in-depth analysis of a
system in which the school of nursing utilized an ad hoc committee to complete the CIPR. Reports generated by the ad hoc
committee concluded that need for improvement was warranted related to policy review. An action plan for continuous
compliance generated implementation of policy software and the creation of an academic support specialist position. An ad
hoc committee completed the CIPR rather than paying faculty overload hours; policy was an exemplar. Faculty development,
team performance, and accountability resulted in a plan for continual compliance that can be adopted in other nursing
schools to meet CCNE accreditation.

p. 18). The CCNE standards were revised in 2013 and
became effective on January 1, 2014 (American Association
of Colleges of Nursing, 2015). In response to the newly revised
standards, it was determined based on program growth that an
aggressive approach to adoption needed to be the plan of
action. The practical aspects of accomplishing this plan of
action are limited in the literature (Lewallen, 2015).
Since 2009, our program has demonstrated significant
growth, including modification from a four- to a five-semes-
ter program. In addition, enrollment has now essentially
doubled with admissions of about 60 students each fall and
spring semesters. The number of faculty has increased by
nine, most of whom have never been involved in a CIPR
self-study. It was decided to make the self-study an ongoing
process. As a result of this decision, it was determined there
was a need to revise the program effectiveness plan (PEP) to
demonstrate continuous evaluation. As the CIPR report
needed to be written utilizing newly published standards, an
Accreditation and Policy/Procedure Ad Hoc Committee was
established to complete this task.
Background
Over the past 30 years, the SON has maintained accredita-
tion status with positive outcomes. The school has grown in
the number of students and admission cycles as well as
course and graduate offerings. The SON found that what
worked in the past for the accreditation process needed to be
altered based on the changes in the size and strategic plan of
the SON and the university. Current practices needed to
change from an informal review to a more formal review.
Historically, the SON had relied heavily on two writers
for preparation of the CIPR. It was typical for one senior
faculty member to be given workload release to assist the
dean in this process. The traditional preparation for the report
included an exhaustive retrospective review and audit of
policies, procedures, committee minutes, and outcomes data
from several prior annual reports. This method was often
tedious as it often uncovered (a) policies that were in need of
review/revision, (b) data that had to be extrapolated from
various sources and data owners, (c) outcomes data that had
lack of clear definition, and (d) less than optimal nonelec-
tronic record-keeping systems that had proven difficult to
navigate. Where in the past, universities and schools
depended on one or two administrators to write accreditation
reports, the trend is now more appropriate to use dedicated
faculty and/or faculty committees, staff, and administrative
positions for the functions of program evaluation and accred-
itation (Romanelli, 2013). Because of these hurdles and
evolving trends, and with the new CCNE standards focus on
continual compliance, the ad hoc committee was formed to
identify new methods and systems to modify the CIPR pro-
cess using a team approach and putting in place new systems
for the future that would support continual compliance. In
addition, this committee was also responsible for program
evaluation and oversight for policy and procedure formation
and dissemination. The purpose for a program evaluation
committee allows ease of accreditation visit reports such as
the CIPR, focuses on readiness for changes in the program
and/or curriculum, sustains consistency in curricular issues,
and continues currency in nursing and educational trends
(Gard, Flannigan, & Cluskey, 2004). A program evaluation
committee has been described as being responsible for
(a) development, implementation, and revision of the program
evaluation plan; (b) recommending data collection instruments
and procedures relating to program evaluation; (c) data
collection and analysis; and (d) reporting findings to the
department chair and program committee to facilitate program
improvement. (Davis, Grinnell, & Niemer, 2013, pp. 672-673)
Formation/Development of Ad Hoc
Committee
While the past accreditations were maintained by one to two
key faculty/administrators, the current process needed to
actively involve input from an ad hoc committee and from
individual faculty and staff to ensure a strategic move toward
continuous compliance. In addition to the key focus on CIPR
completion, the newly formed ad hoc committee quickly
determined that it must also encompass oversight of policy
and procedure management. The Accreditation and Policy/
Procedure committee was sanctioned as an ad hoc committee
of the Faculty Organization (FO) and was charged to oversee
and guide each committee regarding structure and function
in relationship to the PEP.
The new Accreditation and Policy/Procedure Ad hoc
Committee began 1 year and one semester prior to the CIPR
deadline. In addition, the ad hoc committee met weekly to
biweekly for the first few months after it was established.
The ad hoc committee was comprised of four full-time fac-
ulty members and a staff support person. The initial goal to
conduct a needs analysis proved difficult as there was little
past analysis. The first task undertaken was to ensure equal
education to all team members in the CIPR process. This
preparation was completed by group attendance at an online
webinar. The ad hoc committee also reviewed the 2013
CCNE Accreditation Standards (CCNE, 2013b) and used the
Crosswalk (CCNE, 2013a) to review the changes/differences
between 2013 and former 2009 standards. This review of
standards provided all team members with the historical
nature of standards and compliance.
The ad hoc committee then conducted an evaluation of
the completion status for all plan items of the Evaluation of
Program Plan (which became the Program Evaluation Plan)
from the last survey report. Members reviewed each item
planned for in the prior report to determine whether all action
plans were completed, modified, or still in process. Next, the
analysis focused on a complete policy and procedure review
for the faculty and student handbooks. It was determined that
Hanna et al. 3
during this phase of analysis that a set structure would be
utilized to specifically identify (a) date of last review, (b) any
items within the policy or procedure that needed revision, (c)
which standing committee of the FO should be assigned and
be responsible for content for the particular document, (d)
who the actual document owner (by name) would be, and (e)
recommendations regarding policy structure, content, or
overlap between policies (which could be a source of error).
At the conclusion of these two analysis methods, a report
was provided to the FO Committee outlining status of each
prior action plan and global state of the policies/procedures
for both manuals.
Finally, an analysis of all outcome measures (student, fac-
ulty, and external) was conducted. This review uncovered
many areas for improvement in relation to data definitions,
data ownership responsibilities, data storage methods, and
accuracy. As a result, it was determined that it would be key
to establish strict data definitions in outcome measures and
to optimally design a new data warehousing system approach.
Outcomes of the Review of the Ad Hoc
Committee
The ad hoc committee concluded that there was significant
need for improvement regarding the currency and review of
policies along with lack of a precise mechanism for policy/
procedure generation. Further work from this point centered
on development of a precise mechanism/algorithm by which
policies moved from writing to committee review/approval,
to actual implementation within electronic documents, to the
website links. As expected, several policies had been revised
and/or approved that had not gone along the general accepted
mechanism. In response to these findings, as well as data
precision and storage flaws, the ad hoc committee concluded
that modifications were indicated to move from a reactive
model to a proactive, systematic compliance model.
Action Plan for Continuous Compliance
Model
A search for policy/procedure software products was initi-
ated by the ad hoc committee. Committee members were
unable to locate a product designed specifically for nursing
schools. Discussion ensued regarding different software
systems within health care. The ad hoc committee reviewed
these systems to explore their functionality and then
requested a demonstration of one of the products,
PolicyTechTM (Navex Global, 2015). This system uses
Microsoft Word for document development, which was eas-
ily recognizable to team members. In addition, this system
offered batch document upload of our nearly 100 policies.
Other key features of this program included the ability to set
annual review dates to ensure timely compliance with
reviews/revisions.
The electronic notification system of the policy manage-
ment system allows for email alerts to be sent to the policy
owners at increasingly frequent intervals when policies are
set for review and alert other faculty members to participate
in revisions. When a policy is submitted for approval as
revised, an electronic notification is sent to whomever
administration has chosen as final approver. Once a policy is
approved, notification is sent (with a quick access link to the
policy) to all faculty and/or staff who have been preset as
readers. When the readers open their email notifications and
click on the links, they can read the policy and add com-
ments, which are sent back to the owner of the policy closing
the compliance feedback loop.
Administratively, the policy management system offers
some additional features helpful for document version con-
trol, allowing for archival of documents with clear electronic
documentation of dates of policy review, revision, and archi-
val. It is then clear when changes were made, and easy analy-
sis is possible to audit past committee actions regarding
changes due to regulation or standard implementation. The
system also offers a report feature that allows the user to
retrieve reports to determine faculty and staff compliance
with reading current annual reviews of policies and can also
be modified to be used as evidence of annual required train-
ing if it is loaded as a specific policy document within the
system. This policy management system can be used in this
same manner for student compliance; however, the cost
increases based on the number of users who are allowed on
the system at one time.
Based on the assessment and recommendation of the ad
hoc committee, the policy management system was reviewed
by our Chief Information Officer and team and compared
with other vendors of similar products. Implementation of
the system required initial meetings across departments for
the development of departmental-specific policy flow
streams. These meetings were necessary to ensure the map-
ping of policy owners to writers, reviewers, approvers, and
readers was clear. Names of faculty, staff, and students, as
well as email mapping were required, which was undertaken
by Information Services. That process took significant time,
although less than manual entry by each department. Each
department also had to establish the role of a Document
Control Administrator, whose role would have primary over-
sight at the department level and be able to reset document
owners if people or positions changed. The establishment of
this role became one function, assimilated by a new job posi-
tion that was created based on committee input for ensuring
compliance, the Academic Support Specialist.
Academic Support Specialist
While continual compliance is the responsibility of every fac-
ulty member, it became clear through the exhaustive review
of SON reports and documents while compiling the CIPR,
that centralization of data management was imperative for
4 SAGE Open
success. Data had been traditionally kept for committee chairs
and reviewed in minutes and sometimes annual reports; how-
ever, data were often difficult to consistently locate.
Inconsistencies in data definitions for outcome measures can
easily occur as changes in committee membership or chair-
manship naturally occur. This type of inconsistency could
lead to wrong conclusions about performance and perhaps
lack of appropriate resource allocation in quality action plans.
Therefore, the conclusion of the ad hoc committee deter-
mined that each committee governing specific outcomes data
needed to clearly define outcomes. Once outcomes were
established, it was essential that all data be mapped and ware-
housed via one designated entity. The responsibility of the
data keeper would be quality of data, timeliness of data
reporting, and serving as the sole source for historical out-
comes performance. Because this was central to embracing
continuous compliance, the position of Academic Program
Specialist was developed and approved. The staff person
selected for this role now works as an active member of the ad
hoc committee, and all outcomes data are easily accessed via
one office.
Lessons Learned
Over the time frame of 1 year, the ad hoc committee learned
many valuable lessons which are provided here for others
who may be embarking on similar journeys to achieve con-
tinual compliance. Key suggestions are provided to describe
best practice for implementation of a policy management
system, and additional valuable findings are noted as a result
of this journey, including improvement in faculty standards
knowledge, cost-effectiveness, and data warehousing.
Implementation of a Policy Management System
While the decision to recommend a specific policy manage-
ment software was achieved relatively quickly, implementa-
tion at the school level was slowed greatly because the
university also chose to adopt the system for overall use.
This increased the overall planning time due to the inclusion
of different colleges/schools, information technology, and
administration versus just the time that would have been
required to do departmental-level training.
Improved Standards Knowledge
The process of the development of the CIPR greatly enhanced
future preparation and readiness for self-study. Ad hoc com-
mittee members became familiar with the new CCNE stan-
dards through webinar, conference, and review of crosswalks.
The ad hoc committee also wanted the faculty to become
familiar with the new standards and encouraged them to
become immersed in the review of the new standards as well
as the process of self-study review through the standing com-
mittees and the FO. The team approach to review new CCNE
standards by different assigned committee structures created
a sense of accountability and better understanding of the new
standards through a thorough policy and procedure review in
relation to standards. Nursing faculty members need to
broaden their understanding of the accreditation standards by
which their schools of nursing are evaluated (Sharts-Hopko,
2015).
Cost-Effectiveness With Benefits
The ad hoc committee served as a cost-effective method to
oversee the total faculty preparation of the CIPR report.
Preparation for the CIPR and/or the self-study can be accom-
plished through enlisting the services of full-time faculty to
work within their workload or in overload. Some schools
may enlist the service of faculty emeritus or nursing consul-
tants to assist in the compilation of these significant reports.
It is common for many colleges to enlist the services of fac-
ulty in overload or pull out of workload to accomplish simi-
lar tasks. Some colleges additionally hire editors. As the
workload of the group was balanced among team members
and across FO-specific committees, the report was generated
accurately and over many months, easing the workload with-
out any significant additional costs.
Data Warehousing
It is important to note that the most difficult tasks in CIPR
completion are data retrieval, storage, and presentation, both
historically and concurrently throughout the report prepara-
tion period. Through this process of preparing the CIPR, we
learned the priority need for standardization of metric defini-
tions as well as central repository. Performance information
must be housed with one system, and one data manager is
required to ensure continuous compliance. By the develop-
ment of the role of Academic Support Specialist, the SON is
now assured that all faculty members know what data are
submitted at what intervals, as well as have an ongoing cen-
tralized location for accessing data for various purposes,
including grant preparation processes, media releases, and
accreditation needs.
Conclusions and Outlook
In conclusion, the CIPR process proved to be cost-effective,
while promoting faculty development in team performance
improvement and CCNE standards knowledge. This in-depth
analysis of our system in relation to meeting the new CCNE
continuous compliance standards helped our SON look
beyond the here and now and do highly productive strategic
planning for ensuring ongoing standards readiness. Using an
ad hoc committee, as well as reporting structure back to the
faculty's governance body, heightened committee impor-
tance and accountability. Delegation to additional targeted
and assigned subcommittees to ensure ownership of
Hanna et al. 5
committee-specific policy and procedure management as
well as data analysis proved to be essential in overall faculty
ownership and participation in the CIPR. As a result, a large
portion of faculty are more knowledgeable and engaged in
continual compliance as an ongoing journey. Centralization
of data management was essential to ensure data accuracy
and to position ourselves in a new reality where integral per-
formance data are easily available for data analytics. Based
on our journey in mastering continual compliance, the pro-
cess could be easily adopted in nursing schools to best posi-
tion themselves for CCNE readiness and accreditation.
