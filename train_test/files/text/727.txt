Rural Response to Increased Demand:
Crop Choice in the Midwest, 1860-1880
MARY ESCHELBACH GREGSON
Demand for farm products grew, and the cost of marketing them shrank, between
1860 and 1880. The resulting commercialization of Midwestern agriculture has
been widely discussed, but the production strategies that farmers pursued have
not been adequately described or modeled. I find that an endowment-contingent
model of crop choice provides a consistent explanation for farm production
strategies at the micro-level on Missouri farms. The results call for a re-
examination of the conventional wisdom that commercialization fostered special-
ization at the regional level.
The population of the United States grew and urbanized between the
Civil War and 1880, and the demand for food and other farm
products increased. At the same time, Europe opened its markets to
American farmers. The rural economy of the interior United States
developed in response to these new sources of demand. With the rapid
construction of trunk and feeder railroads after the Civil War, farmers in
the Midwest--especially in the states west of the Mississippi River--
seized the opportunity to produce for wider markets.
Rising demand for farm produce and falling transportation and other
marketing costs changed the production strategies of midwestern farm-
ers in two ways. First, a smaller spread between farm-gate and market
prices prompted farmers to sell a larger portion of their total output.
Second, differential decreases in the price spread changed relative
prices at the farm gate, which in turn altered the mix of commodities
that farmers could profitably grow for sale. The first change is well
known: farm surpluses were increasing and home manufactures were
declining on most farms by the eve of the Civil War, and after the war,
exports of commodities grew faster than total output.1 Farmers' strat-
egies for commercialization, however, have been a neglected topic,
even though many measures of farmers' performance depend on crop
mix.

1 model the crop mix decision as a function of farm-gate prices
(market prices less marketing costs) and the farmer's agronomic endow-
ment (proxied by soil diversity). That is, a farmer's decision to plant a
given crop was influenced by increasing demand, falling transportation
costs, and the suitability of his soil for the crop. Endowment-contingent
production is a consistent explanation of farmers' crop mix strategies as
they sold more of their output to meet the needs of distant consumers.
The results of my analysis provide new insight into regional patterns of
agricultural production during this important period in the development
of the U.S. interior. Whereas agronomic endowments provided an
opportunity for Wheat Belt farmers to concentrate on a limited number
of crops as relative price changed, diverse soils provided some Corn
Belt farmers the opportunity to increase the number of crops in their
mix. Specialization was not a necessary consequence of commercial-
ization.
GROWING MARKETS AND CHANGING PRICES, 1860-1880
The population of American cities grew 59 percent between 1860 and
1870 and 42 percent between 1870 and 1880. Urban demand for
foodstuffs grew at least as rapidly, and receipts of livestock and other
commodities at seaboard cities increased steadily over the period 1869
to 1880. In 1870 for example, 125,922 bushels of grain were received at
northeastern ocean ports; in 1880, receipts totaled 315,497 bushels.2
Much of the increase was consumed in the 939 (mostly northeastern)
cities that were home to 28 percent of the American population in 1880,
but transatlantic trade absorbed a growing share after the Civil War. The
volume of wheat exported from the U.S. grew by a factor of five from
1865/69 to 1880/84, and wheat and wheat flour exports from the North
Central States grew from about $20 million in 1870 to $127 million in
1880.3
Midwestern farmers were able to participate in the growing world
wheat market because of improvements in ocean and overland trans-
portation. Lower marketing costs were reflected in the convergence of
international and regional prices of wheat during the postwar decades.
The convergence of prices between major markets was paralleled by the
convergence of farm-gate and market prices. But not all prices con-

Statistics, 1960, from Series A 181-209; and U.S. Department of Commerce, Census of Population:
1960, part A, table 8. Urban real wages were rising with population (Coelho and Shepherd,
"Regional Differences"), and although demand for foodstuffs was income inelastic, quantity and
quality of food demanded rose with income. Interregional trade data are from U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury, First Annual Report, part 2, p. Ill; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Report of the
Commissioner, p. 284; and Hutchinson, "Regional Exports," p. 201.

verged at the same rate. For a Missouri farmer selling in the St. Louis
market, the burden of marketing small grains fell faster than the burden
of marketing livestock or feeds. Between 1867 and 1880, the burden of
marketing oats and wheat in St. Louis fell at annual rates of 2 and 1.6
percent respectively. The burden of marketing corn and livestock fell as
well, but at a rate of only 1 percent per year.4
Steady increases in northeastern and foreign demand for midwestern
farm output, combined with differential decreases in marketing costs,
turned relative prices at thefarm gate in favor of small grains. The shift
in relative farm-gate prices brought about changes in both regional and
farm-level crop mixes between 1860 and 1880. The extent of the changes
in crop mix depended in turn on agronomic endowments.
SOILS AND CROP CHOICE
German rural economists, following the lead of J. H. von Thiinen,
were among the first to recognize that as transport costs fell, inherent
soil suitability became more important in the crop mix decision.
Theodor Brinkmann, in particular, emphasized that when marketing
costs were low, the total cost of crop production depended on the
natural conditions of the farm. As the constraints imposed by high
transportation costs were ameliorated, the constraints imposed by
nature became binding.5
Consider farmers A and B in Figure 1. Both operate farms in the Corn
Belt. They are equidistant from the market and therefore face the same
farm-gate prices. They could be neighbors. However, farmer A has little
land suitable for small-grain production, whereas farmer B can grow
good crops of small grain on more of his fields. Each field has a linear
production possibilities curve (average yield is either 40 bushels of corn
or 15 bushels of wheat on the first field, and 30 bushels of corn or 20
bushels of wheat on the second field, and so on); therefore at any
relative price the farmer chooses to grow either feed or small grains in
each field.6 Differences in soil diversity across the farm translate into a
steeper overall production possibilities curve for farmer A than for
farmer B.
Given the production possibilities and the original farm-gate prices,
neither farmer A nor farmer B produces significant quantities of small
grains (Figure 2). When relative farm-gate prices shift in favor of small
grains, both farmers grow more small grains. Furthermore, because

EVIDENCE FROM MISSOURI FARMS, 1860 AND 1880
My farm-level evidence on crop choice is from a cluster sample of
farms and households in six Missouri townships taken from the 1860,
1870, and 1880 manuscript censuses. The townships are geographically
diverse and represent the range of Corn Belt and general farming
practiced in Missouri and neighboring states. Regardless of the type of
fanning practiced, farmers in these six Missouri townships grew more
small grains as relative prices changed.8
The increases in wheat production between 1860 and 1880 were
7 The effect of agronomic endowments on crop choice can also be expressed algebraically in the
farm profit function (see Gregson, "Strategies," chap. 8).
8 Gregson, Census Sample. The six townships were originally part of the Bateman-Foust sample
(see Bateman and Foust, "A Sample"). They are Rocky Fork (Boone County), Jackson (Camden
County), Freebom (Dunklin County), Prairie (Montgomery County), Salt River (Rails County),
and Mt. Pleasant (Scotland County). Farmers in the sample townships of Rocky Fork, Jackson,
Prairie, Salt River Township, and Mt. Pleasant devoted substantial energy to grains and livestock.
Prairie and Salt River townships comprise a subcategory within the corn-livestock group where the
feedlot system was in operation, albeit on a small scale. Farmers in Freeborn Township, in the
"bootheel" of Missouri, grew cotton as a cash crop, but they still derived over 90 percent of their
total gross farm income from noncotton crops. For more detail on the sample see Gregson,
"Strategies," chap. 3.

dramatic--627 percent on average (Table 1). The smallest increase was
89 percent in Jackson Township; the largest, 5300 percent in Prairie
Township. Production of other small grains increased as well. Together,
wheat, oats, rye, barley, and buckwheat output grew an average of 769
percent on the Missouri farms.9 Not surprisingly, the share of small
grains in gross farm income rose dramatically. In 1860 nearly all gross
farm income came from livestock and feedgrain production. Wheat
accounted for just one-twentieth of gross farm income from commodi-
ties traded interregionally. By 1880, small grains generated one-fifth of
gross farm income.
Table 1 also shows that differences in crop mix across farms were
large. The distribution of small-grain output was not concentrated
around the mean, but was wide: the standard deviation of bushels of
small grains per acre on the farms was larger than the mean for the
sample in all three census years. Although the average Missouri farmer
grew more small grains, some farmers clearly pursued the strategy more
vigorously. I sought to determine whether the farms in the upper tail of
the distribution had more diverse agronomic endowments.
Unfortunately there is no precise geographic information about farms
9 The increase in oats cultivation cannot be explained by increased on-farm demand for oats due
to the adoption of horsepowered machinery. Horses per farm in the sample declined from 4.2 in
1860 to 3.5 in 1880.

Notes: Bushels of output are normalized by size of farm: (bushels)/(total farm acreage). The
denominator for the calculation of percentage of gross farm income derived from wheat and small
grains is the value of crops traded interregionally: wheat, rye, corn, oats, barley, buckwheat,
cotton (grown in Freeborn Township only), value added to cattle, and value added to hogs.
Sources: Quantities are from Gregson, Census Sample, farms in Missouri townships. Farm-gate
prices of field crops for I860 are from Atack and Bateman, To Their Own Soil, p. 222-23; for 1870
and 1880 they are from U.S. Department of Agriculture, "Prices," p. 138-39. For output prices
missing from Atack and Bateman and USDA, "Prices," I substituted the price for the nearest state
as given in other issues of the USDA Statistical Bulletin series on farm-gate prices (Bulletin Nos.
14, 15, and 17). When no farm-gate price was available in the USDA series, I substituted the
national average price from Strauss and Bean, "Gross Farm Income." Detailed price and livestock
value information is given in Gregson, "Strategies," chap. 5.
on the census manuscripts. I derived a simple but reliable measure of
soil diversity for the owner-operated farms in 1860 and 1880 by linking
the Salt River Township census records to the Rails County tax rolls.
The tax rolls provided the legal description of owned land from which
digitized plats of Salt River Township were made. The plats were
overlaid with a detailed soil survey map, and the number of distinct soil
types on each farm was tabulated (Figure 3). I constructed this soil
diversity variable for 78 farm owners in 1860 (75 percent of enumerated
owners) and 156 owners in 1880 (78 percent).10
Table 2 shows the tabulation of the number of soils on individual
farms in Salt River Township and the average bushels of small grains
produced, normalized by farm size in acres. In general, the quantity of
small grains produced increased with the number of soils found on the
farm. The table also shows the one-way analyses of variance of
small-grain output and number of soils on the farm. When soil diversity
is the only source of variation considered, its effect on small-grains
production is insignificant in 1860, but very significant in 1880. The
results are consistent with my model of endowment-contingent crop

County Courthouse staff. The soil map is from Sweet and Watkins, Soil Survey. The digitization
methodology was suggested and carried out by Sean Hartnett.

choice: only after demand increased and marketing costs decreased did
farmers with heterogeneous soils grow more small grains.
Prices and agronomic endowments, however, were only two of the
many elements that factored into farmers' production decisions. Table
3 shows the effects of the characteristics of the farm (the number of soils
and farm size), the size of the farm labor force, attitudes toward risk (the
dependency ratio), and human capital (farm owner-operator age, birth-
place, and mobility), plus interactions, on small-grain production in
1860 and 1880." The model performs as expected. Endowment-contin-

with those for 1860. In 1860, the characteristics of the farm's owner-

variables in the analysis.

b Continuous, rather than categorical, variables.
Notes: The dependent variable is bushels of small grains produced, normalized by size of farm in
acres. Number of soils is the number of soil types found on land owned by the farmer. Categories
of farm size are 3-20 total acres in the census operational unit, 21-40 acres, 81-160 acres, 161-320
acres, and over 320 acres. Farm size is also a proxy for wealth. Labor is the potential male labor
force in the household of the owner-operator. Males over 14 are assumed to have a labor
participation rate of 1, males 11-14 are assumed to have a labor participation rate of 0.17. The
dependency ratio is a proxy for risk aversion and is defined as the number of children ten years and
younger divided by the number of adults and teens over ten residing in the farm operator's
household as reported on the census schedules. Categories of the owner-operator's age are 14-30
years, 31-50 years, and over 50 years. Categories of owner-operator's birthplace are born in
Missouri, the Midwest (excluding Missouri), Northeast, South, and Foreign-born. For the 1860
regression, the mobility variable equals one if the owner-operator was born in Missouri, and zero
otherwise. For the 1880 regression mobility equals one if the owner-operator was linked backward
to the 1870 manuscript census, and zero otherwise. Age, birthplace, and mobility are used as
measures of human capital.

operator and his household contributed more to the crop mix decision
than did the characteristics of the farm, including soil variability. By
contrast, in 1880 the interaction of soil variability with farm size and
mobility were important determinants of crop choice.
Because a field was not usually planted in multiple crops simulta-
neously, small farms were at a disadvantage for adding crops to the mix.
Yet after controlling for soil variability and assuming yield did not
depend on farm size, larger farms did not devote a larger proportion of
their land to small grains than smaller farms in 1860. If "lumpiness" in
the land input prevented small farmers from adding small grains to their
crop mixes, the interaction between number of soils and farm size would
be strong. It was not in 1860. In 1880, however, small farms appeared
less divisible, perhaps because of mechanization. Large farms with
heterogeneous soils were likely to produce relatively more small grains
than small farms with equally varied soils in 1880.
The constraints that labor availability placed on crop choice in 1860
and 1880 have a more complicated interpretation. There were two
periods of peak labor demand on midwestern farms: cultivation of
young corn plants and harvest of small grains. The labor available in the
farm household was an effective cap on small-grain production because
harvesting was labor-intensive, had to be performed in a short span of
time, and because casual hired labor was scarce.12 In 1860 and 1880, the
main effect of a larger household labor force was to ensure adequate
labor for corn cultivation. Table 3 shows that larger quantities of
household labor were associated with crop mixes that were less
concentrated on small grains and more concentrated on corn, hogs and
cattle. On the other hand, the interaction between soils and the farm
labor force has a positive (but not statistically significant) effect on
small-grain production. Thus, farmers with diverse soils required a
larger on-farm labor force to harvest grains, but farmers with homoge-
neous soils used their labor in the corn fields.
Increased cultivation of small grains coincided with increased partic-
ipation in wider, riskier markets. Thus, more risk-averse farmers might
have acted conservatively and might have preferred the traditional corn,
hogs, and cattle crop mix. I used two proxies for risk aversion: the ratio
of dependents ten years of age and under to adults in the farm household
and farm wealth as indicated by size of farm. Again, the effect of farm
size on small-grain production was negligible. The effect of the compo-
sition of the farm household was strong in 1860 but weak in 1880.
Insuring the family against disaster may have been a consideration in the
earlier year but was outweighed by the benefits of growing small grains
for sale by 1880.

The farmer's ability to exploit soil variations on his farm profitably
depended upon his knowledge of soils, crop varieties, and cultivation
methods. I estimated the human capital of farmers using age as a
measurement of experience and birthplace and mobility as measure-
ments of familiarity with specific conditions. Birthplace had no effect on
crop choice after I controlled for soil variability. The interaction
between age and farm size, however, had a positive effect on small-grain
production in 1860: farmers with more experience and more acres grew
more small grains. Thus, human capital played a role in crop choice in
1860, regardless of soil variability.
In 1880, the role of human capital in crop choice was different. Raw
experience (age) was no longer important. Long-term residence mat-
tered. Farmers who had lived in Salt River Township for at least ten
years (that is, they were linked from the 1880 census manuscript back to
the 1870 manuscript) grew more small grains if they had diverse soils
and relied on corn and livestock if they had homogeneous soils.
Although there were differences between the crop mixes of in-migrants
with diverse soils and in-migrants with homogeneous soils, those
differences were not as large as for long-term residents. Experience with
local soils seems to have provided farmers with important information
about the relative profitability of small grains.
When transport costs were high, crop choice was mainly a function of
distance from the market. Variation in agronomic endowments did not
result in variation in crop mixes. But soil type became an important
factor in crop choice after the demand increases and marketing cost
decreases of the post-Civil War period. Farmers who had varied soils
and the knowledge to exploit them responded to the changes in relative
prices by growing more small grains than farmers with less knowledge
about the specific conditions in Salt River Township.
REGIONAL SPECIALIZATION REVISITED
The shift by Missouri farmers from a crop mix strategy almost wholly
devoted to corn and livestock in 1860 to a strategy that included
substantial amounts of small grains in 1880 seems to run counter to the
conventional story of regional specialization in agriculture during the
last half of the nineteenth century.13 As marketing costs fell and demand
rose, the story goes, farmers on the Plains became the nation's
producers of wheat, farmers in the Northeast produced perishables,
farmers in the South strengthened their ties to cotton, and farmers in the
Midwest came to produce an overwhelming share of U.S. feedgrains
and finished livestock. Agricultural historians call this regional special-
ization. But specialization has another definition: the concentration of

farm production on fewer and fewer outputs.14 Using the endowment-
contingent model of crop choice, it is easy to show that the first
definition does not imply the second. Though farmers in the Corn Belt
were the primary corn, hogs, and cattle producers for the nation during
the period, they expanded their output of other small grains as well.
Figure 4 shows the dynamic of the endowment-contingent model for
two regions. The regional crop mix outcome is analogous to the
farm-level outcome of Figure 2. The regions are equidistant from the
market but have different soils and climates. The production possibili-
ties curve for the Corn Belt region indicates that although the cultivation
of small grains (SG) is possible, it requires a large sacrifice of corn, hog,
and cattle production (CHC). Similarly, while the Wheat Belt can
produce both small grains and livestock-feedgrains, its production of
small grains falls off dramatically with each increase in livestock-
feedgrain production. Thus for any nonzero price, Corn Belt farmers
produce more livestock and feedgrains than Wheat Belt farmers who, in
turn, produce relatively more small grains. This was the situation under
the "original prices at the farm gate" of Figure 4.
Extensive growth in the regions would not have changed the compo-
sition of the crop mixes, other things equal. But in response to the
relative price shift caused by higher demand and lower transport costs,
14 Shares of national agricultural output by region can be computed from the state aggregates
found in the U.S. Census Office, Compendium of the Tenth Census, table 43. For a historiography
of agricultural specialization see Gregson, "Specialization."

Wheat Belt farmers clearly specialized. They devoted more of their
resources to their mainstay, small-grains production. Corn Belt farmers
also found it advantageous to grow more small grains. But this meant
that Corn Belt crop mix became more diversified in an absolute sense.
CONCLUSION
Understanding crop choice is necessary for understanding how Amer-
ican farmers adjusted to their changing economic environment, espe-
cially during the late nineteenth century when industry finally overtook
agriculture as the leading sector in terms of value added. William Parker
has identified transport costs, movements of labor and capital, and
differences in the natural suitability of land for various crops as the three
elements that determined the pattern of agricultural production. I have
highlighted the role of agronomic endowments in the analysis of crop
choice by Missouri farmers, and I have shown how explicit incorpora-
tion of soil endowments and climate affects regional analysis. Only
additional studies of farm-level decisions can lead to a clearer picture of
how choices by individual farmers shaped regional aggregates. As
Parker warned, "[t]he exact effects of each of these influences have
never been sorted out, and the economic history of regional specializa-
tion needs closer scrutiny."15
