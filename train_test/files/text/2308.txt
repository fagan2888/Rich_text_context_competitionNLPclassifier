Abstract
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of bicycle-related injuries
presenting to United States emergency departments (EDs).
Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) database
was used to derive national, weighted estimates of nonfatal ED visits for bicycle-related injuries by
patient age, sex, diagnosis, injured body part, locale of incident, traffic-relatedness of incident, and
month of incident.
Results: Males accounted for 73% of all bicycle-related injury ED visits. Patients aged 10 to 14 years
represented the 5-year age interval with the highest rate of bicycle injury visits (488 per 10,000). Fifty-six
percent of ED visits for bicycle-related injuries came from cyclists who were riding on the street, with
increased street ridership in those who were older than 15 years, and 99.7% of all patient injuries
occurring on the street (as opposed to other locations) were related to motor vehicle collisions (MVCs).
The head and face were the most injured body parts in the overall population. In addition, the largest
proportion of head injuries, relative to total injuries in the age group, occurred in the very young (0 to
4 years) and elderly (65+ years) populations. The leading rider injury diagnoses were contusion,
abrasions, and hematomas. The incidence of bicycle-related injuries peaked in the month of July.
Conclusions: The study identified the characteristics of bicycle-related injuries across various age groups
of riders. This information will aid in developing more effective age-appropriate injury prevention
strategies. The frequency of MVC-related injuries deserves attention and suggests the need to examine
strategies for limiting interactions between moving vehicles and bicyclists.

Bicycle riding is a popular activity that has
both health and environmental benefits. In
recent years, with increases in traffic congestion1
and the number of bike lanes,2 and installation of bicycle
sharing systems,3 bicycling has become an increasingly
viable and popular option for transportation. As a result,
bicycle-related injuries may become more common
emergency department (ED) presentations. Currently,
such bicycling injuries have not been well characterized
in the United States. Previous studies describing bicy-
cling injuries have been limited by geographic location,4­
6 type of injury,7,8 specific context (e.g., bike racing),9,10
specific injury trends (e.g., temporal trends),11 or older
data.12 More detailed information on biking injuries will
aid in identifying and implementing preventive strategies
that effectively target specific subsets of the population.
The purpose of this study was to describe the epide-
miology of nonfatal bicycling-related injuries in the U.S.
population presenting to U.S. EDs. This is the first
large-scale national study to use data from the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Pro-
gram (NEISS-AIP) to examine the incidence and charac-
teristics of bicycle-related injuries treated in U.S. EDs.

Study Setting and Population
The NEISS-AIP database includes data from 66 of the
100 NEISS hospitals, which are representative of the
5,000 hospitals that have a minimum of six beds and a
24-hour ED in the United States and its territories. The
NEISS-AIP collects data on nonfatal injuries treated in
U.S. EDs, and each NEISS case is assigned an inverse
probability weight (IPW), which represents the inverse
of the probability of the case being selected into the
sample. These IPWs can be used to derive annual,
weighted estimates of nonfatal injuries treated in EDs.
We reviewed patient data for all nonfatal bicycle inju-
ries occurring from January 1, 2001, through December
31, 2008.
Study Protocol
NEISS-AIP data include information on patient age and
sex, injured body part, principal diagnosis, locale of
incident, case disposition, immediate and precipitating
cause, and sports/activity-relatedness. The NEISS-AIP
also collects data on traffic-relatedness, defining traffic-
related injuries as those resulting from motor vehicle
collisions (MVCs) occurring on a public highway, street,
or road. The NEISS-AIP defines nonfatal injury as bod-
ily harm resulting from severe exposure to an external
force, substance, or submission.
We reviewed data from 2001 through 2008 for all
nonfatal bicycle injury visits by patients of all ages. Only
injuries coded as "8 ­ BICYCLE" under the "SPORTS"
variable were used for the purposes of analysis. Even
though the code for an injury related to a bicycle falls
under the "SPORTS" variable, any bicycle injury (not
just in a sports setting) was coded as "8" under the
"SPORTS" variable. Using the national estimates, pro-
portions of injuries were calculated by sex, age, injured
body part, diagnosis, locale of incidence, MVC-related-
ness (defined as a coding of "yes" to the variable for
"traffic-relatedness"), disposition, and month of injury.
Along with the estimated data, raw data (the actual
number of cases reported) were also reported in the
tables under the columns labeled "Sample Size." Census
data were used when calculating the number of injuries
per 10,000 in each age group.
The breakdown of injuries by specific body part was
calculated for separate age groups to determine body
regions where each age group was more prone to
injury. In addition, the body parts with the highest inci-
dences of injury within each age group were further
broken down by diagnosis to shed light on the severity
of injuries to the body parts with higher incidences of
injury. Diagnoses of concussion and internal injury to
the head were reclassified as traumatic brain injury
(TBI),13 and internal injuries to all other body parts were
put into the "other" category.
There were no missing data for month of injury, and
there were minimal missing data for age (0.016%
unknown); only cases with known ages were included
in the analyses using percentage breakdown by age.
Missing data for injured body part and diagnosis are
listed in the tables under categories of "unknown" and
"other," respectively. Missing data for locale (27%
unknown) were treated as missing at random (MAR),
so the percentage breakdown for the different locales
of incident only took into account those cases with a
recorded locale. Similarly, missing data for MVC status
(31% missing) were assumed to be MAR, so only the
cases with observed MVC status were used to calculate
the percentage of ED visits precipitating from an
MVC.
Data Analysis
Data analysis was performed with STATA 12 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX), and the NEISS-assigned
IPWs were applied using the pweight option under the
svy command.
RESULTS
From 2001 through 2008, there were an estimated
30,445,478 sports-related injury visits to U.S. EDs by
patients of all ages. Bicycle injuries were the second
largest contributor to sports-related injury visits after
basketball, accounting for 12.7% of all sports injury vis-
its (3,868,680 of 30,445,478). Males accounted for 73% of
all bicycle injury visits. Patients aged 10 to 14 years
represented the 5-year age interval with the highest
percentage of bicycle injury visits (26%), and patients
aged 0 to 34 years accounted for 78% of all bicycle
related visits (see Table 1). The mean ages (Æ standard
deviation [SD]) of injured males and females were
22.6 (Æ0.98) and 22.3 (Æ1.14) years, respectively.
Table 2 summarizes the proportion of injuries by
body part. The three body parts with the highest inci-
dences of injury are marked within each age group.
Among those aged 0 to 14 years, the greatest incidence
of injuries occurred to the face, head, hand, arm, and

wrist (percentages vary by age group breakdown). For
those aged 15 to 64 years, the upper trunk, face, and
head were the most injured body parts. For the elderly
(65 years and older), the head, upper trunk, and lower
trunk had highest incidence of injury. Overall, the body
parts comprising the largest proportions of injury were
the face (15.6%), head (12.6%), and upper trunk (12.1%).
The top three injured body parts when the injury
involved an MVC were the head (15.2%), upper trunk
(14.5%), and face (13.5%)
Common diagnoses for the most frequently injured
body parts are summarized in Table 3. Although contu-
sion/abrasions/hematoma was the most common diag-
nosis overall, the most common diagnosis within body
part categories varied across different body parts. The
most common diagnosis for head injuries was TBI
(66%). For face injuries, lacerations were most common
(61%); for wrist, hand, arm, and upper trunk injuries,
fracture/dislocations were most common. Overall, the
most common diagnoses were contusion/abrasion/
hematoma (30%), fracture/dislocations (23%), and lacer-
ations (22%).
Bicycling-related injury locations are summarized in
Table 4. The highest incidences of bicycling injuries
occurred on the street (56%), around the home (28%),
during sports activity (9.5%), and in public areas (5.7%).
Overall, MVCs accounted for 58% of all bicycle-involved
injuries, and this percentage has been relatively con-
stant from 2001 to 2008 (see Figure 1). The percentage
of injuries by age arising from MVCs is summarized in
Table 5. Whereas only 17% to 39% of injuries to those
aged 0 to 9 years resulted from MVCs, 69% to 76% of
injuries to those aged 15 years and older resulted from
MVCs. In addition, 99.7% of all injuries occurring on
the street were MVC-related, and this percentage did
not change from 2001 to 2008.
Disposition of injuries was as follows: 94% of patients
were treated and released, 4% were hospitalized, and
1% were transferred and released. Figure 1 shows the
breakdown of bike injuries by treatment month. The
5-month range from May through September accounted
for 64% of all bike injuries, with incidence of bike injury
peaking in July, which contained 12% of all bike
injuries.
DISCUSSION
This study examined epidemiologic features of bicy-
cling-related injuries seen in U.S. EDs from 2001
through 2008. We found that those aged 5 to 14 years
have the highest rate of injury, but their injuries were
more likely to occur off the street and were less likely to
be MVC-related when compared to the injuries to older
cyclists 15 years and older. In contrast, the majority
(70%) of all ED bicycle injuries to those 15 years and
older occurred on the street, and this percentage for the
overall age range has been relatively constant from
2001 through 2008, ranging from 50% to 62%. Nearly
all injuries on the street involved collisions with motor
vehicles. This suggests that in the last 10 years, even
with extensive promotion of bike lanes,14,15 there has
been no decrease in MVC-related injuries on the street
or in general.

572 Chen et al. · BICYCLE INJURIES, 2001 TO 2008
The body parts most commonly injured when the
injury involved a MVC were the head, upper trunk, and
face. This finding has several implications for the pre-
vention of bicycle injuries, particularly in the area of
safety gear recommendations and biking infrastructure.
First, since upper trunk and face injuries are similar in
frequency to head injuries resulting from MVCs, bikers
on the street might receive additional protection
through development of new safety gear, such as rigid
protective vests and facial protection. Numerous stud-
ies, along with current biking education, describe the
importance of helmet use,16­20 but they have not
focused on protection for the upper trunk or face,
which have injury incidences nearly as high as the head
for cyclists on the street. Wearing gear such as rigid
protective vests and face shields may minimize injury to
the upper trunk (e.g., rib fractures, damage to internal
organs, shoulder dislocations) and to the face (e.g., face
lacerations). For children aged 10 to 14 years, the age
group with the highest injury rate, wrist and hand inju-
ries were almost as prevalent as head injuries and face
injuries, suggesting that children might benefit from
development of new safety gear such as gloves and
wrist stabilizers for the hands and wrists, since these
might minimize injury to those body parts that are often
first used to break a fall.
Our findings have implications with regard to trans-
portation infrastructure. Because 99.7% of bike injuries
incurred on the street involve MVCs, traffic engineering
interventions might further minimize the interaction
between bicyclists and motor vehicles. Previous studies
have shown that clearly marked, bicycle-specific facili-
ties (i.e., bike routes, bike lanes, and bike paths) provide
increased safety for cyclists compared to on-road
cycling with traffic.21­25 In addition, in a 2010 study,
Lusk et al.26 reported that the relative risk of MVC-
related injury was lower on cycle tracks (physically sep-
arated bicycle-exclusive paths along roads) compared
with bicycling in reference roads (a parallel road with
the same intersection frequency and cross-traffic).

Furthermore, a study by Teschke et al.27 found that
cyclists on cycle tracks had lower odds of injury
compared to those biking on streets with parked cars.
Teschke et al. also found that cyclists biking on a major
street with no parked cars had lower odds of injury
than those biking on a major street with parked cars.
These findings suggest implications for the revision of
current city transportation engineering guidelines
toward separating bicyclists from motor vehicles (both
parked and moving) to decrease the risk of collisions
between cyclists and motor vehicles.
Other more immediate policy implementations that
may decrease bicycling-related injuries include revi-
sions to licensing examinations and road training.
Potential revisions for future study include placing
greater emphasis during driver's licensing road train-
ing and tests on performing "head checks" for cyclists
prior to turning, changing lanes, and opening car
doors.
Our finding that the 5-month range from May
through September accounted for 64% of all bike-
related injuries, with incidence of injury peaking in July,
is consistent with the findings of Loder and Abrams.12
This information could be used to guide injury preven-
tion programs to increase educational campaigns for
wearing proper safety gear immediately before the
increase in cycling activity in the summer months.
LIMITATIONS
The NEISS database does not provide patient data on
severity of injury or follow-up care, which prevented us
from distinguishing the more severe bicycling injuries
from the relatively minor ones. Second, the fact that
only bicycling injuries treated in EDs were included
implies that the total number of bicycling injuries is
likely to be underestimated and tends to represent the
more severe cases, as injuries that were treated at
home, in urgent care clinics, and in physician offices
were not reported. Third, the NEISS does not provide
information on use of safety equipment by patients, so
we were unable to assess the effects of safety helmet
use (or nonuse) on head injury status. Fourth, because
some cases did not contain information on locale of
injury or MVC involvement, it is unknown in which
direction the cases with unreported information could
have caused bias.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that nearly three-fourths of
bicycle injuries presenting to EDs in patients aged
15 years and older are related to motor vehicle
collisions. The most injured body parts in motor vehicle
collision­related injuries are the head, upper trunk, and
face, suggesting that, in addition to the emphasis of
proper helmet use, future research on the development
of new safety gear (e.g., protective vests and face

shields) may minimize injuries to these body parts. Also,
as 99.7% of injuries on the street involve collisions with
motor vehicles, cyclists might receive additional protec-
tion from infrastructure plans that physically separated
bicycle-only paths along roads to decrease contact
between bicyclists and motor vehicles.
Children aged 10 to 14 years represent the age group
with the largest proportion of bicycle injuries, although
these injuries are less likely to stem from a motor vehi-
cle collision than the injuries incurred by those aged
15 years and older. Children aged 10 to 14 years in par-
ticular have a high incidence of injury to the wrist and
hand, suggesting that development of protective gloves
and wrist stabilizers might prevent wrist fractures or
damage to the hand in the event of a crash.
