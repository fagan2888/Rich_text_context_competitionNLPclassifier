Article
The act of passing in earlyAfricanAmerican novels, whether
for White or for Black, or not passing when passing would be
possible, is necessarily about identity formation and mainte-
nance, and so can be susceptible to analysis that focuses on
questions about the dynamics of identity in each work.
Furthermore, identity in these novels exists in a historical
and cultural context that has substantial weight that encum-
bers the forms that identity can take. As M. Guilia Fabi
(2001) states,
Early African American novelists used [the awareness that
personal identities are constructed] most obviously to explode
white delusions of the naturalness and legibility of race, but they
also moved on to a deeper and more complex discussion of "the
`praxis'of identities" in the making of black culture . . . (pp. 5-6)
At the same time, the issue of identity formation and cul-
tural context has long been seen as fundamental to discussions
of postmodernist literature and ethos. In Framing the Margins:
The Social Logic of Postmodern Culture, Phillip Brian Harper
(1994) brings concepts about postmodernism, in particular, that
"postmodern fiction foregrounds subjective fragmentation"
(p. 3), to bear on literary works that "occupy the cusp between
the modernist and postmodernist enterprises, and thus . . . con-
stitute prime material for an inquiry into the social problemat-
ics that subtend contemporary postmodern practice" (p. 24).
His purpose is to interrogate and expand our understanding
of and, notably, our theories about the postmodern and, espe-
cially, about postmodern identity. P. B. Harper (1994) exam-
ines works that are about characters who differ from the
social "center" of power, or what P. B. Harper (1994) quotes
Audre Lorde as calling the "mythical norm" of being "white,
thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian and financially
secure" (p. 13), in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation,
and social class. P. B. Harper (1994) highlights these charac-
ters as members of marginalized groups and "suggest[s] that
postmodern decenteredness may actually be a function of the
increasing implication in the `general' culture of what are
usually thought of as socially marginal or `minority' experi-
ences" (p. 12).
In this article, I apply Harper's thinking about fragmented
postmodern identity to the issue of racial passing1 and trace the
treatment of that motif across six African American novels:

From Necessity to Possibility:
Postmodern and Heideggerian Aspects
of Passing and Identity in Early African
American Novels From 1853 to 1912
Charles Cullum1
Abstract
This article applies theories of fragmented postmodern identity and Heidegger's modes of existence and concept of
historicality to the issue of passing and traces the treatment of that motif across six African American novels that move from
the largely realistic perspective of the 19th century to the subjectivist perspective of the early 20th century. These novels
thus foreshadow the postmodernist questioning of the basis of discrete personal identity. The article claims that, across
these novels, the act of passing and its relationship to human identity through time and historical circumstance becomes
problematized from a necessary tool for escaping slavery, and so sustaining identity in its most basic form as life itself, to a
potential existential dilemma of identity as a matter of authenticity and possibility. The article further discusses whether the
individual is constrained by his or her background, especially, by race itself, or is a totally free, ungrounded agent.

The Bondwoman's Narrative, A Novel, by Hannah Crafts
(circa 1850s, published 2002); The Garies and Their Friends,
by Frank J. Webb (1857/1969); Iola Leroy, or Shadows
Uplifted, by Frances E. W. Harper (1892/1988); The House
Behind the Cedars, by Charles Chesnutt (1900/2003); and
The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man, by James
Weldon Johnson, (1912 anonymously and 1927 under the
author's name). These novels, I contend, move from the
largely realistic perspective of the 19th century to the subjec-
tivist perspective of the early 20th century and that fore-
shadow the postmodernist questioning of the basis of discrete
personal identity. I claim that, over the course of these nov-
els, the act of racial passing and its relationship to human
identity through time and historical circumstance becomes
problematized from a necessary tool for escaping slavery,
and so sustaining identity in its most basic form as life itself
to a potential existential dilemma of identity as a matter of
authenticity and possibility. That is, as these novels move
toward what might be termed a more postmodern sensibility,
the issue of identity can be seen to become more postmodern,
or potentially open, as well. For, as bell hooks (1990) has
observed, "postmodern critiques of essentialism which chal-
lenge notions of universality and static over-determined
identity within new culture and mass consciousness can open
up new possibilities for the construction of self and the asser-
tion of agency" (p. 28). In this movement, the cultural condi-
tions that pertain to the individual and his or her identity are
always seemingly in question, that is, whether the individual
is constrained by any aspect of his or her background, espe-
cially, by race itself, or is a totally free, ungrounded agent. Of
course, the very concept of "racial identity" has come to be
recognized as an artificial construct of the colonial European
powers of the 19th century and their rationale for enslave-
ment and colonialization of subject peoples of color. As
Naomi Zack (1997) in her well-known essay, "Race, Life,
Death, Identity, Tragedy, and Good Faith," summarizes,
The concept of race as ordinarily used in racialized and racist
cultures is based on pseudoscience and ill will. Even though race
is commonly taken to be biological, not all people of a racialized
group have the same heritable biological traits. No genes or
chromosomal markers for any of the designated groups have
been identified. There are also no verified correlations between
so-called biological traits and any cultural traits. Empirically,
the assumed biological foundation of race turns out to be nothing
more than a changing range of biological traits--no different
from other biological traits by anything biologically "racial"
about them--that have been selected as racial. (p. 99)
The liberatory power of racial passing is, therefore, sub-
ject to the critical point of acceptance or rejection of the con-
cept of race itself. For her part, Zack (1997) goes on to make
the existential case for the rejection of the concept and of its
potential for affecting one's actual life:
I submit that to experience oneself as a member of an oppressed
race in the existential return-to-life after awareness of death
constitutes an intolerable constraint on freedom after the return
. . . The perpetual moment of freedom is therefore raceless. Race
has nothing to do with my life in the existential sense of identity.
(p. 103)
Taking the opposite view is no less a philosophical voice
than that of George Yancy (2008), who maintains that, as fac-
ticity, race does indeed matter:
From the perspective of whiteness, I am, contrary to the
existentialist credo, an essence (Blackness) that precedes my
existence . . . My darkness is a signifier of negative values
grounded within a racist social and historical matrix that predates
my existential emergence. (p. 1)
While conceding that race "is not real qua constituting a
physical property of the universe" (p. 34) nonetheless, Yancy
insists that "race is `out there'in a socially ontologically sub-
stantive way" (p. 34, emphasis in original).
In this article, I find it helpful to the discussion to apply
central phenomenological tenets from the work of Martin
Heidegger.2 For example, I would contend that it is precisely
because of Heidegger's work in healing the schizophrenia
brought about by Descartes and, arguably, the whole of
European metaphysical thought since the Greeks that
Heidegger's work can be especially helpful in offering a
view of human being that rejects the mind­body duality
prevalent in the racialized context of African American lit-
erature and American culture. More than any other philoso-
pher since Descartes, I would argue, Heidegger succeeded in
offering an alternative to the Cartesian dilemma, the fateful
division of Being into the subjective and objective, that
forced humans from their natural home on the earth and
among others and into their own subjectivity as the only
epistemological perspective possible. Descartes's goal was
to locate a foundation for science and ultimately for an
understanding about the essence of human being itself. By
locating this ground in the intellect--"Cogito, ergo Sum"--
Descartes believed that he avoided the vagaries of the senses
and of ordinary experience. However, the price of his locat-
ing this ground in the human intellect was to create a new
dualism between the mind and the body, between the subjec-
tive and the objective, between "the world of intellectual
intuition" and "the world of phenomenal experience" (Fell,
1979, pp. 4-5). Crispin Sartwell (1998) makes the case in Act
Like You Know: African-American Autobiography and White
Identity that the racial distinction of Black or White is based
on "the dualisms that dominate the Western tradition" (p. 14)
and that this duality precedes Descartes and is, in fact, char-
acteristic of Western philosophy since its beginnings:
The particular forms of economic and political hegemony which
we practice are articulated through what is essentially a
metaphysical construction. The primary dualisms of the Western
tradition are between mind and body, culture and nature, general
and particular. These dualisms are coded into European
languages or, it has been suggested (by Derrida among others),
Cullum 3
are constitutive of European languages. So, if black is coded as
physical, natural, and particular . . . and white is coded as
intellectual, cultural, and general, this calls into service the vast
machinery of Western conceptuality that has been developing
since the Greeks. (p. 14)
The thought of Heidegger offers a way out of this dualism
and therefore a potential means of striking at the very heart
of the racism that results from that dualism. In Being and
Time, Heidegger (1962) defines "the entity which each of us
is himself and which includes inquiring as one of the possi-
bilities of its Being . . . by the term `Dasein,'" (p. 27) or
"Being-there" (p. 27, fn. 1), "there" referring to Being-
in-the-world. One of the "existentials," or ways that Dasein
is aware of itself as existing, is state-of-mind, which
Heidegger (1962) defines as "our mood, our Being-attuned"
to the world and to our past in it (p. 172). One of the major
characteristics of state-of-mind is "thrownness," our "factic-
ity," the "that it is and has to be" of Dasein (p. 174, emphasis
in original), the things that we are physically, socially, and
historically over which we have no control. In its thrown-
ness, Dasein is already in the world. In terms of the question
of a first cause or a ground to human being, then, Heidegger
(1962) asserts the
impossibility of the metaphysical quest for a transcendental,
nonrelative ground; the quest contradicts itself by being always
already grounded in the experience of the absence of a final
ground . . . the true and always-prior ground is the clearing,
Dasein's own Being-in-its-world. (As cited in Fell, 1979, p. 58)
In other words, the
primordially given "I" or self is always and already part of the
world; and indeed, a world in which other persons are likewise
given . . . the highly abstract and purely rational "ego" of the
Cartesian metaphysics is a fiction . . . (Gelven, 1989, pp. 70-71)
Sartwell (1998) cautions,
It is characteristic of European and European-American male
theoretical production that it fails to acknowledge its sources in
personal experience and in social situations. In particular it fails
to acknowledge its location in the social situation of privilege
and oppression . . . Left to my own devices, I disappear as an
author. That is the "whiteness" of my authorship. This whiteness
is, for us, a form of authority; to speak (apparently) from
nowhere, for everyone, is empowering, though one wields
power here only by becoming lost to oneself. (p. 6, emphasis in
original)
However, in contrast to this European tradition and the
reason that Heidegger himself saw his work as representing
a turn away from--or, famously, the "end" or "completion"
of Western metaphysics (Heidegger, 1977, p. 432)--is that in
his approach, one's being is always already "in the world." It
is not possible by definition to deny one's "social situation,"
or to transcend--that is, meta--the physical world. In the
process of my investigation, I use a number of Heideggerian
concepts that are particularly apt in elucidating fundamental
aspects of identity expressed in these novels. Specifically, I
use the Heideggerian existentials, or modes of existence, of
state of mind, fallenness, and understanding, and the
Heideggerian concept of historicality as delineated through
heritage, fate, and destiny. History, in Heidegger's view, "is
about the worlds of those Daseins whose stretch-along
between their respective births and deaths constitutes a sig-
nificance of the past" (Gelven, 1989, p. 205). Historicality,
for Heidegger, is the existential awareness through which
one understands being in history. There are three grounds to
historicality: heritage--or tradition, a part of thrownness;
fate--the awareness of finitude; and destiny--part of being
with others as applied to a whole people or nation.
Moreover, I discuss an important aspect of the postmod-
ern attitude that Phillip Brian Harper (1994) does not exam-
ine, specifically, that fragmentation of existing systems of
order, even of an individual's sense of his or her own subjec-
tivity, can be not only marginalizing and debilitating but also
potentially liberating, or at least enabling of possibilities.
And, just as Harper sees the condition of decenteredness of
marginalized characters as being so within the structure, the
centeredness, of society, these horizons of possibilities are
themselves contained within cultural and historical contexts.
In that sense, the postmodern aspects of a character are not
apolitical or ahistorical, but are rather always already
engaged in the social as well as the phenomenological world.
As Africana philosopher Robert Birt (1997) claims,
To become human and develop a human identity is a process of
invention (self-invention), of personal and collective action
conditioned by social relations. If Sartre is right that in claiming
that "freedom is impossible to distinguish from the `being' of
human reality," then we humans can invent ourselves and create
autonomous identities. But we do so through actions and choices
conditioned by our social existence. (p. 206)
And, this social process is different from traditional
European approaches. Relating this self-invention to the exis-
tentialist thought of Jean-Paul Sartre, Lewis R. Gordon (1997),
in his introduction to Existence in Black: An Anthology of
Black Existential Philosophy, cautions that, although "Sartre
stands as an unusual catalyst in the history of black existential-
ist philosophy" (p. 2), "it will be an error to construct Africana
academic existential philosophy as a fundamentally Sartrean
or European-based phenomenon" (p. 3) because,
although there are Africana philosophers who have been
influenced by both Sartre and European thought, for the obvious
reason that there has been no place "outside" of Western/
European civilization from which to raise questions about
existence in the twentieth century, it will nevertheless be
fallacious to assume that the influence functions as the "cause"
instead of a consequence. (p. 3)
4 SAGE Open
For, Gordon (1997) notes,
Africana philosophers already have a reason to raise existential
questions of liberation and questions of identity . . . by virtue of
the historical fact of racial oppression manifested most vividly
in the European and Arabic slave trade and the European
colonization of the African continent and the entire world of
color. (p. 3)
And, Frantz Fanon (1963/2004), whom Gordon (1997)
refers to, with Richard Wright, as "undoubtedly the twentieth
century's two most influential Africana existentialist `men of
letters'" (p. 9), throughout The Wretched of the Earth empha-
sizes the need for the issues of identity and possibility to be
tied to the social and political sphere. In a passage that is
consistent with Heidegger's view of the historicality of
Dasein, Fanon declares that "When the colonized intellectual
writing for his people uses the past, he must do so with the
intention of opening up the future, of spurring them into
action and fostering hope" (p. 167).
To continue my point about the correlation between post-
modern art and the social world, Linda Hutcheon (1988) has
argued for just such a connection through, specifically, post-
modernism's use of parody, which
paradoxically brings about a direct confrontation with the
problem of the relation of the aesthetic to a world of significance
external to itself, to a discursive world of socially defined
meaning systems (past and present)--in other words, to the
political and the historical. (p. 22)
Similarly, connecting African American literature to the past
and so to history, Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1983), in his foun-
dational article, "`The Blackness of Blackness': The Critique
of the Sign and the Signifying Monkey," defines the central
trope of African American literature as "signifying," the
repeating, revising, parodying, and extending of previous
works: " . . . black writers read and critique other black texts
as an act of rhetorical self-definition. Our literary tradition
exists because of these precisely chartable formal literary
relationships, relationships of signifying" (p. 693). And,
finally, Teresa C. Zackodnik (2010), in The Mulatta and the
Politics of Race, builds on the work of Hazel Carby on the
racialization of the 19th-century "cult of true womanhood,"
on theories of parody, and on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s (1983)
theory of signifying as including performance as well as
"verbal and musical texts" to posit a type of signifying that
she terms "parodic performance" (p. xxi). Through parodic
performance of "racialized womanhood and whiteness," the
mulatta figure in the texts she examines "signify on power
structures African American women sought to redress"
(p. xxvii). By orienting her discussion around the "redress-
ing" of social ills, Zackodnik (2010) emphasizes the com-
plexity of the issue of passing and the mulatta figure, its
resistance to a simple duality of interpretation, and, from a
different theoretical direction, the significance of the past.
For, although a character has the freedom to choose to pass,
to perform an identity, the experiences of the past have
weight and, to the extent that those experiences have been
imbued with the political and psychological effects of rac-
ism, cast their shadows across the future actions of the pass-
ing self.3 So, too, the viability--in Heideggerian terms, the
authenticity--of the identities of the protagonists in the nov-
els that I discuss can be seen in relation to their ability to
acknowledge and use their past experience to condition their
range of action, of possibilities, for the future.
In these early African American novels, that past experi-
ence is fraught with the horrors of slavery, Reconstruction,
and post-Reconstruction in the United States. The impact of
these horrors on character is discussed by Stephen Knadler
(2003) in "Traumatized Racial Performativity: Passing in
Nineteenth-Century-African American Testimonies" in
terms of trauma theory and performance studies to arrive at
what he terms "traumatic performativity" (p. 66) in African
American texts. Specifically, his purpose is "to look at the
complex and often fragmented process by which certain
extensively rehearsed memories come to, and sometimes fail
to, mediate a core narrative of the self . . . " (p. 66). In the
process, Knadler critiques both poststructuralist and African
American studies' views of passing and its meaning for per-
sonal identity. The former, he says, focuses on race as a cul-
tural construction based on behavior. The latter does not
deny the constitutive nature of race but promotes the value of
maintaining race pride, solidarity, and self-determination for
the achievement of social justice. Both views, according to
Knadler, underplay or ignore the role of trauma on identity
formation and maintenance. Knadler quotes trauma theorist
Cathy Caruth's definition of trauma as "the response to an
unexpected or overwhelming violent event or events that are
not fully grasped as they occur but return later in repeated
flashbacks, nightmares, or other repetitive phenomena"
(p. 65, emphasis in original). In such circumstances, the self
is unable to express the traumatic experience in traditional
discourse, that is, the discourse of the dominant culture, and
so is left with gaps in its ability to perform racial identity.
Both the poststructuralist and African American studies
views, Knadler argues, stress the passer's choice of racial
identity, which he ties to "neoliberal capitalist democracy
and late twentieth-century versions of multiculturalism"
(p. 68), and thus repress the passer's trauma.
To return to the Heideggerian concepts of state-of-mind
and "thrownness," or our "facticity," this existential/phe-
nomenological aspect of the facticity of human being is most
pronounced negatively in a racist context. For the laws gov-
erning the institution of slavery define the slave as chattel, a
piece of property, an object. And so, as Robert Birt (1997)
has observed, quoting Simone de Beauvoir, "the black per-
son is `reduced to pure facticity, concealed in his immanence,
cut off from his future, deprived of his transcendence'"
(p. 207). Without the ability to make choices, being relegated
to oppression and objectification, having no real position as
Cullum 5
a subject, racist oppression, Birt (1997) claims, "robs people
of their identity . . . [and] imposes rigid, stultifying identities
on its victims" (p. 206). Furthermore, "all oppression begets
alienation [and] . . . according to Angela Davis, alienation `is
the absence of authentic identity'" (p. 207).
Going even further in the direction of victimhood and its
effects, Knadler's (2003) approach supports the role that I
claim phenomenological facticity plays in not only the for-
mation and the performance of identity but also on the self's
future horizon of possibilities. For no aspect of experience of
the character, including the traumatic events and the
responses that they produce in the character, can be excluded
from, or elided across, the impact that they have on a charac-
ter's identity and on the horizon of possibilities for that char-
acter. As Heidegger (1962) puts it,
Possibility . . . does not signify a free-floating potentiality-for-
being . . . In every case Dasein . . . has already got itself into
definite possibilities . . . Dasein is being possible which has been
delivered over to itself--thrown possibility through and through.
(p. 183, emphasis in original)
For the characters in these African American novels who
are born with certain racial attributes and in a condition of
slavery, those facts are part of their "thrownness" into the
world.
Such thrownness is the major focus in what is generally
acknowledged as the first novel by an African American,
Clotel: or, The President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave
Life in the United States, written by William Wells Brown
and published in London in 1853. For the main characters,
Currer, Thomas Jefferson's former hired slave and mistress,
and her two daughters with Jefferson, Clotel and Althesa, the
choice to pass for White involves their survival because
racial passing offers a means of escape from slavery. Brown's
literary style of mixing fictional and non-fictional elements
has been widely discussed, often to his detriment as a novel-
ist. However, Eve Allegra Raimon (2004) sees this style as
purposeful. She also links it to a style that we have come to
think of as postmodern:
The title character's story is constantly interrupted by a complex
assortment of seemingly disparate textual elements--a pastiche
of short stories, anecdotes, biographical notes, histories,
transcriptions of newspaper clippings, billboard announcements,
and other such artifacts woven loosely together in a collection
one might fairly term protopostmodern. (p. 68)
Raimon (2004) goes on to claim that "the blurring of the
boundaries of fictivity that is so insistent in Clotel joins with
the project of blurring the boundaries of race and nation,
revealed as their own brand of fiction" (p. 70). This "blur-
ring" coincides with Brown's "double-edged narrative strat-
egy" (p. 71) toward the largely White readership, dramatized
in the novel's first scene of the auctioning of female slaves,
of appealing both to the reader's sympathy for the victims of
slavery's "sexual exploitation" (p. 70) and to the reader's
"anxieties about `amalgamation'" (p. 71). The results are
also that this approach "introduce[s] the reader to the notion
of the instability of racial identities" and "place[s] the origin
of such racial instability where it belongs, not with the advent
of widespread antislavery agitation in the 1830's but with the
very founding of the Republic, and before" (p. 71). This
racial instability can be tied, in Phillip Brian Harper's (1994)
term, to the social marginality of African Americans in ante-
bellum America, certainly, but the even more interesting
aspect of Raimon's point--and of Brown's approach--is that
this racial instability is applicable, at least theoretically
through miscegenation and the uncertainty of "pure" racial
bloodlines that necessarily proceeds from it, to the entire
society, thus sowing the seeds of both greater fragmentation
of racial identity and greater possibility of choice of such
identity for future generations of Americans.
Althesa and Clotel pass for the wives of White men,
though Clotel's marital arrangement is sub rosa from the
start. In fact, the novel has come under some criticism for
what is seen as an overemphasis on the roles of passing and
of Whiteness. Ann duCille (2000) discusses this criticism in
general and the point of view of critic Addison Gayle in
particular:
Gayle asserts that Brown was incapable of portraying anything
other than stereotypical images and secondhand ideas. He
simply rebutted popular depictions of blacks as brainless,
childlike Uncle Toms or lawless "brute Negroes" with
counterimages of beautiful quadroons--romantic images that
appealed to whites and to the black middle class . . . (p. 453)
However, duCille (2000) argues that Brown and other
19th-century African American writers chose
a strategy of the times, [an] attempt to argue for equality by
establishing resemblance, by collapsing difference into
sameness, by pointing out the mutability of race and the
absurdity of white society's color codes through the trope of the
mulatto, tragic and heroic [and that contemporary readers may
be guilty of applying a kind of] prescriptive, anachronistic
criticism [to these writers]. (p. 454)
To be sure, Clotel and her daughter Mary are tragic fig-
ures. Their facticity while passing carries the weight of the
secret of their mixed ancestry, and so because of their soci-
ety's racial essentialism they suffer a kind of fragmentation
of the self. However, as duCille (2000) contends, they are
also heroic figures. In Heideggerian terms, this heroism can
be linked to the concept of authenticity. The Self, Heidegger
(1962) says, "is . . . for the most part inauthentic, the they-
self" (p. 225). The "they-self" is an aspect of the existential
of fallenness, which Heidegger (1962) defines as "an absorp-
tion of Being-with-one-another," or "Being-lost in the pub-
licness of the `they'" (p. 220). In and of itself, fallenness into
the world is not a negative quality; it is simply one mode of
6 SAGE Open
being. But to the degree that it becomes, in Heidegger's
(1962) term, "a constant temptation" (p. 221) to Dasein to
turn away from its own selfhood, fallenness is a potential
problem for personal identity. Clotel and Mary face the
temptation of fallenness in two senses: First, they could sim-
ply go along with the "they-self" of their social circumstance
of slavery; second, while passing, they could go along with
the "they-self" of White society and forget about their past,
as Clotel could forget about Mary after escaping to the north.
Fallenness is in its basic aspect what Heidegger (1962) terms
"inauthentic." Inauthenticity also is not a categorically nega-
tive quality, but rather simply a part of Being in the world.
Heidegger (1962) contrasts the inauthentic Self to "the
authentic Self--that is, . . . the Self which has been taken hold
of in its own way" (p. 167, emphasis in original). One comes
to authenticity through the existential of understanding, which
Heidegger (1962) defines as "the phenomenological basis for
seeing [possibility] as a disclosive potentiality-for-Being" (p.
183). Through their experiences, Clotel and Mary come to the
existential of understanding and choose to live authentically
by "taking hold" of their own heritage and the horizon of pos-
sibilities stemming from it even when, as in Clotel's case,
doing so may result in death.
In February 2001, Henry Louis Gates Jr. purchased a
holograph manuscript from the Swann Galleries in New
YorkCityduringitsyearlyauctionof"PrintedandManuscript
African Americana" (Gates, 2002, p. xxi). The title of the
manuscript was "The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah
Crafts, a Fugitive Slave, Recently Escaped from North
Carolina," and the date of origin was put at "circa 1850's"
(Gates, 2002, p. xxiv). Based on his evaluation and research
into its authorship and date, Henry Louis Gates published the
manuscript in 2002 as The Bondwoman's Narrative, A Novel,
by Hannah Crafts. In his introduction to this first edition of
the novel, Gates (2002) states his view that "this fictional-
ized slave narrative . . . [is] possibly the first novel written by
a black woman and definitely the first novel written by a
woman who had been a slave" (p. xxv). As the auction cata-
log description says, "the narrative is not only that of the
mulatto Hannah, but also of her mistress who turns out to be
a light-skinned woman passing for white" (Gates, 2002, p.
xxiii). In fact, Hannah's mistress, Mrs. Vincent, has not actu-
ally made a deliberate choice to pass. She has led a life of
southern White privilege unaware that she has been "pass-
ing" since birth, for she was exchanged for the stillborn child
of the mistress and raised as the Master's daughter. The later
discovery of her origin shocks Mrs. Vincent to the point of
fragmenting her sense of self--she "was" one person and
then she "is" a totally different person in the eyes of the law
and society. Along with shock, Mrs. Vincent feels shame and
regards the fact of the infant exchange as "the secret of my
birth" (Crafts, 2002, p. 46), "the horrible truth" (Crafts, 2002,
p. 48), "the worst" (Crafts, 2002, p. 48), and "a curse"
(Crafts, 2002, p. 49). Although pejorative, her reaction to her
true background has the objective rationale that the legal
status of a child in the slave states followed that of the
mother, and so, if her background is revealed, Mrs. Vincent
could be sold at any moment. With this threat hanging over
her, she quickly agrees to Hannah's advice to run away. In
making this decision, Mrs. Vincent changes identity again,
for she goes back to passing as White as a means of escape.
Thus, for Mrs. Vincent, "passing" carries the burden of her
struggle to hide a literal secret.
In these terms, Mrs. Vincent experiences what would seem
to be impossible--a change in her thrownness, the material
facts of her being--by her color and race changing instanta-
neously. Of course, what this change actually dramatizes is
not a change in her thrownness but rather the arbitrariness of
the social perception of her thrownness, that is, the absurdity
of the "one drop rule" that defines a person who has any
African heritage whatsoever as a Negro and thus as a slave.
As with Clotel, Hannah faces the temptation of falling
into the they-self of the stereotype of the obedient slave. In
particular, in dealing with Whites, Hannah must suppress her
own mental acuity. As Adebayo Williams (2003) points out,
Hannah's "sharp wit, intellectual elevation, and sense of dan-
ger . . . are contrasted unfavorably with the dim-witted clum-
siness and obtuse procrastinations of her mistresses and other
socially superior ladies" (p. 144). Hannah's knowledge of a
mistress's embarrassing encounter with social fashion in the
form of face powder that turns her face, ironically, black
leads to Hannah being falsely accused by a jealous fellow
slave of revealing the episode and to Hannah being sent to be
the wife of a field hand whom she hardly knows.4 Hannah
decides to escape a second time, not, as with Mrs. Vincent, to
help her desperate mistress, but for her own sake.
Hannah's successful escape from this forced marriage is
accomplished by her ability to pass first as a White boy and
then as a White girl. Like Mrs. Vincent, Hannah has frag-
mented her identity between races, but going farther than
Mrs. Vincent, Hannah crosses the gender line as well as the
color line. The ability to pass, then, although indicative of the
degree to which identity may be seen as socially constructed,
can in the context of the struggle to survive the horrors of
slavery be seen as a valuable tool that can fool anyone, Black
or White, male or female. However, when Hannah reaches
freedom in New Jersey, she chooses a life that is not racially
ambiguous in any way, that is, she makes a clear choice of
one side of the color line. She marries a Black minister who
"has always been a free man" (Crafts, 2002, p. 246), settles
into a community of African Americans, and "keep[s] a
school for colored children" (Crafts, 2002, p. 244). In this
choice, this Heideggerian projection of her own possibilities,
Hannah heals the postmodern-like fragmentation that has
characterized her sense of self to this time by firmly acknowl-
edging and accepting her African American heritage.
Hannah, as Phillip Brian Harper (1994) says of the protago-
nist of Invisible Man, comes to understand "the importance
of [her] identification with the black community if [s]he is to
achieve individual identity" (p. 135).
Cullum 7
Published in London in 1857, Frank J. Webb's The Garies
and Their Friends has been traditionally acknowledged to
be, after Brown's Clotel, the second novel published by an
African American. Although written in the same decade as
Clotel and The Bondwoman's Narrative, The Garies and
Their Friends offers a strikingly different view of African
American society, yet raises similar issues about identity.
The setting is not the cotton plantation south but the mercan-
tile north, specifically, Philadelphia, which by the 1830s had
a significant and thriving free African American population.
The main conflict of the novel is based on the tensions
between White, particularly Irish, immigrants and African
Americans over jobs and social status that resulted finally in
the Abolition Riots of 1842 (DuBois, 1899/1967).5 The
Garies are an interracial couple; he, a wealthy Georgian
planter, and she, a beautiful, lighter skinnedAfricanAmerican
slave whom he bought for US$2,000 some 10 years before
on "the auction-block at Savanah" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 2)
and fell in love with. Although legally unable to marry in
Georgia, the couple live as a family with their two children,
Clarence and Emily, both of whom "showed no trace what-
ever of African origin" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 2). Mrs. Garie
fears that "if anything should happen" (Webb, 1857/1969, p.
53) to her husband, she and the children "might be sold and
separated for ever" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 54), and so she
convinces her husband to move the family to Philadelphia.
The move to the north, however, as slave narratives such
as Frederick Douglass's (1845/2001) attest,6 does not bring
relief from bigotry and discriminatory civil practices. These
practices, though, are mild precursors to the horror of the
race riot that results in the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Garie. How
the two children grow up from this point, how their identities
form, makes the central point about passing in the novel. For
the two--both capable of passing for White--take distinctly
different paths. Emily, as a female, is allowed to remain in
the African American community and grows to be a happy
and well-adjusted adult. Clarence, however, is sent to an all-
White boys' school far away and so put on a track for life as
passing for White. The children's guardian, the African
American entrepreneur Mr. Walters, agrees to the plan pro-
posed by Balch, the Garies' White lawyer, but suspects trou-
ble may result from his decision in the long run; for Clarence,
Walters worries, "must live in constant fear of exposure; this
dread will embitter every enjoyment, and make him the most
miserable of men" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 275). The term that
Walters uses, "dread," is particularly appropriate to my dis-
cussion of the issue of identity, for dread is the term that
Heidegger uses to describe that state of mind that makes us
"aware of what is . . . We are thrown in a world. Dread brings
us face to face with this thrownness" (Gelven, 1989, 118,
emphasis in original). In Clarence's case, this dread is the
awareness of his mixed racial background and how that is
perceived in the world of antebellum America, even in the
north. For Heidegger (1962), dread can be a catalyst for an
individual to confront his ability to make choices, that is, to
be authentic. For Clarence, though, the matter of whether he
makes an authentic choice to pass for White is muddled, for,
as Guilia Fabi (2001) observes, "Clarence's passing is an
externally imposed lifelong necessity that emerges as one
more form of racial oppression . . . young Clarence falls vic-
tim to the white family lawyer's conviction that as a white
person he `will be better off'" (p. 39).
Given this problematic nature of Clarence's choice to
pass, his further development as White can also be seen as
questionably authentic. More probably, as the evidence indi-
cates, his is another example of pre-postmodern fragmented
identity. At the beginning of the novel, Clarence is simply
himself, a child with a beautiful mother with a "light-brown
complexion" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 2) and little, if any, sense
of racial identity. After the riot, though, Clarence becomes
racially divided, as Balch tells him, "we are going to send
you where it is not known that you are coloured; and you
must never, never tell it . . . " (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 279,
emphasis in original). As a result of this socially enforced
racial essentialism, that is, the expectation that a person must
be either Black or White, Clarence must necessarily disas-
sociate from his former life and so from a central part of
himself. For example, he begins to think of African
Americans, including his sister, as the Other: " . . . I can't go
[to see her] with any comfort or pleasure . . . each year as I
visit the place, their ways seem more strange and irksome to
me" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 322). In fact, he betrays a racial
schizophrenia, even as he denies its possibility: " . . . I can't
be white and colored at the same time; the two don't mingle,
and I must consequently be one or the other" (Webb,
1857/1969, p. 323). Genetically, of course, Clarence is both
Anglo and African, but society demands that he can be only
one, and if it knew of the African part, would classify, essen-
tialize, him as Black. Clarence expresses his sense of frag-
mentation in Heideggerian terms: "My education, habits, and
ideas, all unfit me for associating with [African Americans];
and I live in constant dread that something may occur to
bring me out with [whites]" (Webb, 1857/1969, p. 323,
emphasis added). This "bringing out" does indeed finally
transpire and ruin Clarence's plans to marry the (White)
woman he loves, and he lives out the brief remainder of his
life "very wretched and lonely . . . apart from both [white and
Black] society" (Webb, 1857/1969, pp. 380-381).
Iola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted, published in 1892 by
Frances E. W. Harper, begins during the Civil War and ends
during Reconstruction and so can be seen as a "transition
from the antebellum period to the Harlem Renaissance"
(Foster, 1988, p. xxxvii). Iola Leroy shares the circumstance
with Mrs. Vincent of The Bondwoman's Narrative of having
her sense of self reversed overnight. Born to a wealthy
Louisiana planter, Eugene Leroy, and Marie, his light-
skinned former slave, whom he sent north to be educated and
then married, Iola has never been told of her mixed heritage
and so is "perfectly ignorant of [her] racial connection"
(Harper, 1892/1988, p. 113). One minute, she is defending
8 SAGE Open
slavery to her abolitionist schoolmates at an exclusive girls'
school in the north:
Slavery can't be wrong . . . for my father is a slave-holder, and
my mother is as good to our servants as she can be . . . I don't
think these Abolitionists have any right to meddle in our affairs.
(Harper, 1892/1988, pp. 97-98)
The next minute, she is tricked into leaving the school by a
lawyer sent by her father's cousin and heir after Leroy's
death by yellow fever, returned to Louisiana, and sold as a
slave. The shock of this change causes Iola "intense horror
and agony" (Harper, 1892/1988, p. 114). As a beautiful
young woman, she is purchased "to keep house," a euphe-
mism for sexual services, but because, in the words of her
slave friend, Tom Anderson, "she's a reg'lar spitfire" in
resisting such service, she has been sold "all ober de kentry"
(Harper, 1892/1988, p. 38).
Iola, then, is marginalized by race--from White to Black;
by social status--from privileged aristocrat to slave; and by
sexual status--from respected lady to purchased concubine.
By any standard of expectation, she should suffer a break-
down of her sense of self. The world as she knew it has col-
lapsed; everything she believed to be true is false. Her world,
that is, has become strikingly chaotic and absurd, or post-
modern. Yet Iola's identity, finally, does not remain frag-
mented. Teresa Zackodnik (2010) states that Iola is "forced
to become self-reliant and independent as a result of [her]
experiences" (p. 110). Certainly, Iola does become self-reli-
ant and independent. She even maintains her sense of pride
in the most humiliating circumstances and is able to ascribe
shame to the perpetrators rather than the victims of abuse:
I have heard men talk glibly of the degradation of the negro
[sic], but there is a vast difference between abasement of
condition and degradation of character. I was abased, but the
men who trampled on me were the degraded ones. (Harper,
1892/1988, p. 115)
However, it cannot be, tautologically, that Iola responds
resiliently because there are forces that militate against her.
Rather, Iola is able, though marginalized in several social
categories, though having had her sense of self shattered, to
reconstitute her fragmented identity. The means by which
she does so can be understood through Heidegger's concept
of history and historicality. History, in Heidegger's view, "is
about the worlds of those Daseins whose stretching-along
between their respective births and deaths constitutes a sig-
nificance of the past" (Gelven, 1989, p. 211, emphasis in
original). Historicality, for Heidegger, is the existential
awareness through which one understands being in history.
There are three grounds to historicality: heritage--or "one's
tradition as significantly determining . . . the makeup of the
`world' that one is `in' as Being-in-a world" (p. 212), a part
of thrownness; fate--"one's awareness of one's finitude . . .
[and] one's limited possibilities and the ensuing significance
of one's choices and decisions" (p. 212, emphasis in origi-
nal); and destiny--"a kind of fate on the level of a whole
people . . . grounded in Dasein's Being-with of others" (p.
213). Iola responds to her changed circumstances by seeing
herself anew as a historical being. Whereas she was a typical
southern belle who believed in the southern ideal of the south
as an Anglo Saxon Camelot, a world out of space and time,
her sudden change in material circumstance jolts her back
into history by making her aware of her own finitude.
Moreover, she becomes aware of destiny and heritage through
identification of herself--imposed at first but then accepted
and avowed by her by choice--as African American.
Specifically, when the Civil War ends and the hospital at
which Iola serves as a nurse closes, Dr. Gresham suggests that
she, like many other White women, open a school for African
American children. Up to this point, Iola has been a slave and
in that sense has identified withAfricanAmericans. However,
after the war, she can choose to be White orAfricanAmerican.
Her greatest temptation to choose to be White comes in the
form of a marriage proposal from Dr. Gresham, who as "a
member of a wealthy and aristocratic family, proud of its lin-
eage, which it could trace through generations of good blood
to its ancestral isle" (Harper, 1892/1988, p. 58), represents
that same Anglo Saxon ideal that grew beyond the south
throughout the 19th century along with American militarism.
As Raimon (2004) explains, "The growing confidence in
white racial superiority blended with a parallel sense of provi-
dentially sanctioned nationalist destiny" (p. 28).7
Although Gresham is attracted to Iola, and proposes to her
even after learning of her origin, he nonetheless sees that ori-
gin as shameful: "he resolved to win her for his bride, bury
her secret in his Northern home, and hide from his aristocratic
relations all knowledge of her mournful past" (Harper,
1892/1988, pp. 59-60). More generally, he displays a view of
African Americans as less than equal to Anglo Saxons. For
example, in attempting to persuade Iola of his genuine affec-
tion for her, the two become entwined in a discussion of the
aftermath of slavery, and Dr. Gresham expresses the same
view that African Americans must pull themselves up by their
own bootstraps, must, that is, earn the equality that is granted
them, like every other citizen, by law, that, a few years after
the publication of Iola Leroy, BookerT.Washington expressed
in hisAtlanta ExpositionAddress: Specifically, Gresham says
that African Americans "must learn to struggle, labor, and
achieve" (Harper, 1892/1988, p. 116). Gresham then holds up
the model for African Americans to emulate:
The Anglo-Saxon race is proud, domineering, aggressive, and
impatient of a rival . . . They have been a conquering and
achieving people, marvelous in their triumphs of mind over
matter. They have manifested the traits of character which are
developed by success and victory. (Harper, 1892/1988, p. 116)
Thus, Gresham wants (a) to separate Iola artificially from her
own, again, in Heidegger's term, thrownness--he tells her, "I
love you for your own sake.And with this the disadvantages of
Cullum 9
birth have nothing to do" (Harper, 1892/1988, p. 114); (b) to
deny, and to have her deny, her heritage and the destiny that
she could share with African Americans; and (c) to bestow
upon her, noblese oblige, his own thrownness, his Anglo
Saxon heritage and destiny. For example, in response to her
continuing the discussion of the lot of African Americans,
Gresham, "a little impatiently," protests, "But, Iola . . . what
has all this to do with our marriage? Your complexion is as
fair as mine. What is to hinder you from sharing my Northern
home, from having my mother to be your mother?" (Harper,
1892/1988, p. 116). To this idyllic question, Iola brings the
hard genetic facts that might disrupt his Anglo Saxon para-
dise and that a medical man might have been expected to
anticipate, a point she ironically emphasizes by addressing
him by just his title: "Doctor . . . suppose we should marry,
and little children in after years should nestle in our arms,
and one of them show unmistakable signs of color, would
you be satisfied?" His reaction--"His face flushed as if the
question suddenly perplexed him" (Harper, 1892/1988, p.
117)--reveals his most fundamental feelings toward African
Americans and provides Iola with the motivation to resist the
very significant temptation to renounce her heritage by
accepting his proposal of marriage.
In rejecting Gresham, Iola takes a major step to her own
authentic choice of identity. In choosing to follow that path
of destiny that accords to the African American people, Iola
acknowledges in the most substantive manner possible that,
in the United States, race matters. As Barbara Christian
(1980) discusses, Iola represents a different kind of mulatta,
one "no longer tragic or melancholy but a source of light for
those below and around her" (p. 29). It is because Iola
chooses to identify with her African heritage that she does
not see herself as having to hide a secret of identity or to feel
a shame of origin. And, it is because she chooses to project
her destiny with that of African Americans that she sees her
future as having meaning and possibility.
The characters' motivation for passing changes with the
historical circumstances in Charles Chesnutt's The House
Behind the Cedars, published in 1900. In North and South
Carolina "a few years after the Civil War" (Chesnutt,
1900/2003, p. 3), passing is no longer necessary as an escape
from slavery. For John Warwick/John Walden, passing is
instead a means to prosperity and higher social status. He
thinks of his origin and heritage as an African American as
"the blight of his inheritance" (Chesnutt, 1900/2003, p. 21)
and rails momentarily "against the fate which made it neces-
sary that he should visit the home of his childhood, if at all,
like a thief in the night," but he is able to assign such
responses to "pure sentiment" (Chesnutt, 1900/2003, p. 22),
for he has chosen to be one of those "men who have elected
to govern their lives by principles of abstract right and rea-
son" and to "be careful about descending from the lofty
heights of logic to the common level of impulse and affec-
tion" (Chesnutt, 1900/2003, p. 21). Moreover, as a lawyer,
Warwick's view of race is legalistic. As John Sheehy (1999)
asserts, Warwick's "is the mind of a lawyer . . . Warwick/
Walden is white, by appearance, by blood, and, more impor-
tantly, by law" (p. 409, emphasis in original). As Judge
Straight advises John Walden when he comes to him as a boy
announcing that he wants to be a lawyer, John might one day
go to South Carolina, where the law allows that a person of
mixed blood might be considered White not only if "the
admixture of African blood did not exceed one-eighth" but
also "by reputation, by reception, and by their exercises of
the privileges of the white man . . . " (Chesnutt, 1900/2003,
p. 118). John Warwick, then, solves his own sense of margin-
alization, heals the fragmentation of his identity, by simply
ignoring a part of his facticity in a socially acceptable way,
that is, by legal definition, and creates a wholly new identity.
There is some residue of his prior self left over in the emo-
tion he feels in missing his mother, but he seems willing to
accept the weight of that residue in exchange for his new
identity.
In Heideggerian terms, an initial inclination might be to
conclude that Warwick lives authentically because he
chooses, from among all of the genuine elements of his per-
sonal background, his facticity, that is, from among the
White and the Black aspects, to live his life as a White man.
However, there are several reasons why this view is prob-
lematic. First, in his approach to living his life, Warwick is
still living with a lie and a secret, and so is not authentically
facing his facticity. Second, Warwick's need to pass for
White requires him to accept uncritically the values of that
White, particularly idealized Anglo Saxon society--for
example, the Tournament scene contrasts Warwick playing
the knight and honest Frank Fowler watching the pretentious
event from the sidelines--and so requires him to act inau-
thentically. Third, Heidegger's conception of freedom, like
his conception of possibility, is not absolutely free.As Joseph
Fell (1979) explains,
Heidegger does not describe freedom as a present power of
autonomous or arbitrary choice . . . [Freedom] means the
impossibility of any essential amelioration or progressive
transformation of the human condition and situation, for it is a
being-free for a future that is in all essentials the recurrence of
what has already been, and one of these essentials is the thrown
and factical necessity of having to take over a particular past that
one can never make over from the ground up ex nihilo because
it is itself part of the ground. (pp. 62-63)
What this means in terms of Warwick's authenticity in
fine and the authenticity of mixed-race characters in general
is that one is always already what one is factically and that
facticity has meaning in the projection of possibilities into
the future. A character who denies or ignores the whole of
what he or she is limits or perverts the range of possible
choices for the future, and so is living inauthentically.
Not only does Warwick live inauthentically but also he
succeeds in leading his younger sister into this condition of
inauthenticity by prying her from her life with their mother
10 SAGE Open
in Patesville, North Carolina, to his estate in Clarence, South
Carolina, and changing her name from Rena Walden to the
romantic, Ivanhoe-inspired Rowena Warwick. However,
although Warwick's regret over repudiating his mother and
his heritage is minimal, Rena/Rowena falls into the senti-
mental trope of the tragic mulatta because she suffers from a
combination of the kind of shame that Mrs. Vincent in The
Bondwoman's Narrative felt about her secret past and a nos-
talgia for her family life with her mother and her heritage. For
example, when considering a marriage proposal from the
White, aristocratic George Tryon, Rena hesitates "due to a
simple and yet complex cause . . . It was the consciousness of
her secret . . . Rena's secret was the worm in the bud, the
skeleton in the closet" (Chesnutt, 1900/2003, pp. 52-53).
And, because the people she has heretofore identified with
and her heritage are socially marginalized by the dominant
culture and defined as inferior, in passing Rena is acquiescing
to the they-self of that dominant culture and their view rather
than acknowledging the facts of her background and her heri-
tage, and so, like her brother, living inauthentically. As
Sheehy (1999) says, "Rena ultimately assents to assuming an
`owned' identity, historically predetermined and founded on
European notions of race . . . this `received'identity masquer-
ades for Rena as an image of her `essential' self" (p. 412).
When Tryon learns of Rena's background and drops her,
she returns to a life as an African American schoolteacher
and seems to accept that identity. When George Tryon's
mother visits the school coincidentally without knowing of
Rena's former relationship with George and asks Rena
whether she is "really colored," the narrator tells us, "A year
and a half earlier, Rena would have met the question by some
display of self-consciousness. Now, she replied simply and
directly. `Yes, ma'm, I am colored'" (Chesnutt, 1900/2003,
p. 167). Yet, she still accepts an essentialist, socially defined
version of her identity, one that categorizes, limits, and
embarrasses her. For instance, when Tryon sends her a letter
asking to meet after learning of her proximity, Rena, in her
letter of response, writes,
You are white, and you have given me to understand that I am
black. I accept the classification, however unfair, and the
consequences, however unjust . . . As a white man, this might
not mean a great deal to you; as a woman, shut out already by
my color from much that is desirable, my good name remains
my most valuable possession. (Chesnutt, 1900/2003, pp.
179-180)
Clearly, Rena is still pining for her former "passing" life with
George, and the loss of it has caused her pain. She has
become the sentimental tragic mulatta, coping with a sense
of original shame, and in that role she dies a horrible and
seemingly unnecessary death from "brain fever" induced by
her getting lost in a swamp during a storm as she runs from
both Tryon and would-beAfricanAmerican suitor, Jeff Wain.
Although Wain is not the gentleman he pretends to be, he
does represent a Black alternative to the White Tryon.
Moreover, the male character in the novel who is unarguably
the finest person and who has loved Rena since childhood,
Frank Fowler, is someone who she does not even see as a
possible mate. Thus, in a sense, Rena rejects both White and
Black males, showing the confusion and sorrow over her
own racial identity as the tragic mulatta figure of the 19th-
century sentimental novel.
Published anonymously in 1912 and then in 1927 under
the author's name, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured
Man, by James Weldon Johnson, problematizes issues of
authentic destiny and of identity more than any previous
novel of racial passing. In fact, I would argue that with The
Autobiography, the sentimental and realistic elements of the
African American novel coalesce with the novel of the domi-
nant culture into the psychologism of the Modernist period.
Certainly, the mind of the narrator is as much the ground of
the action of the novel as is its physical and cultural geogra-
phy as we watch his struggle to acclimate to, and his alien-
ation from, whichever society, for example, superficially
integrated Connecticut, African American New York, White
Europe, the African American South, or White New York, he
lives in at the time. But, even more interestingly, we can see
the roots of a postmodern division of identity in the narra-
tor's sense of himself. This fragmentation can be seen in all
the African American texts I have discussed but is enunci-
ated most memorably in The Souls of Black Folk with W. E.
B. DuBois's (1903/2007) term "double-consciousness,"
this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of
others . . . One ever feels his two-ness,--an American, a Negro;
two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring
ideals in one dark body . . . (p. 3)
In The Autobiography, the narrator alludes to "that remark-
able book by Dr. DuBois, The Souls of Black Folks" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 169) in the context of writers who are depict-
ing the full range of African American life beyond stereo-
type, but, more to the point, mentions also his own "transition
from one world into another" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 20),
from White to Black, and so to double-consciousness, or
what he terms "a sort of dual personality," of being "forced
to take his outlook on all things, not from the view-point . . .
of a man . . . but from the view-point of a coloured man"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 21, emphasis in original).
Furthermore, what Phillip Brian Harper (1994) concludes
about Maxine Hong Kingston's autobiographical narrative,
The Woman Warrior, may be said of The Autobiography,
namely, that it represents
a postmodernistic human subject whose existence is highly
unstable and contingent upon the various narrative motifs that at
any moment are deployed to ground [his] personality; that
representation derives . . . specifically from the narrative
treatment of social difference and marginality. (p. 28)

In The Autobiography, those narrative motifs take the
form of test-case identities that the narrator tries on through-
out the novel, unwilling to make, in Heidegger's term, an
authentic choice of identity. His indecisive attitude can be
seen in the fact that, unlike other characters in the passing
tradition, the ex-colored man sees his situation as more comic
than serious. At the beginning, he refers to his passing as "a
practical joke on society" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 3) and near
the end of the novel as "the capital joke I was playing"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 197). This view of passing as comic
seems to indicate that passing has changed from a matter of
necessity--either for literal survival or for social or economic
gain--to a matter of arbitrary preference. Specifically, the ex-
colored man could choose at various times to be Black, White,
or Italian by virtue of his olive complexion, or French,
German, or Spanish by virtue of language and cultural flu-
ency, and could slip into any of these identities for no greater
reason that his own satisfaction, as when he takes "pride that
[he] spoke better Spanish than many of the Cuban workmen
at the [cigar] factory" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 73).
To be sure, throughout his life, the narrator identifies
more with Whites than with Blacks. For instance, when at
school a Black student throws a slate at a White student, the
narrator joins the crowd of White students who retaliate: "We
ran after them pelting them with stones . . . " (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 15, emphasis added). And, the narrator finds it
easier to praise Whites than Blacks. For example, in a discus-
sion of the reaction of White southerners to the possible
advancement of the former slave class, the narrator says, "I
could not but appreciate the logic of the position held by
those Southern leaders who have been bold enough to pro-
claim against the education of the Negro" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 170). Moreover, when the narrator relates his
experiences traveling through the south, he adopts an anthro-
pological tone that smacks of smug White superiority. As
Donald Goellnicht (1996) states,
The anonymous narrator . . . in aiming for a "detached" or
"objective" stance on the race question--the position the social
scientist conventionally pretends to--not only distances himself
from the black America he depicts, but frequently chooses to
adopt the gaze of white society. (p. 20)
For example, the narrator delineates elements of "Negro dia-
lect"--such as "Lawd a mussy!" and "Look heah, chile!"--
and condescendingly praises the "droll humour" and "ability
to laugh heartily" that "does much to keep [the Negro] from
going the way of the Indian" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 56).
Furthermore, like an anthropologist, the ex-colored man cat-
egorizes those he observes. He outlines three classes ofAfrican
Americans, all of them dominated by the "white gaze," for, as
the narrator acknowledges, they are "not so much in respect
to themselves as in respect to their relations with the whites"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 76): first, the "desperate class--the
men who work in lumber and turpentine camps, the
ex-convicts, the bar-room loafers" who hate and avoid
Whites; second, the "domestic service" class, comprised of
"the servants, the washerwomen, the waiters, the cooks, the
coachmen" who are closely connected to Whites; and third,
the "well-to-do and educated class," including "indepen-
dent workmen and tradesmen" who "live in a little world
of their own" away from Whites (Johnson, 1912/1970,
pp. 76-79).
In his description of these categories, the narrator betrays
what may seem to be an authentic identity, that of a social
and economic elitist. For instance, on his first trip to Atlanta,
he reacts to what he sees as "the unkempt appearance, the
shambling, slouching gait and loud talk" of the large African
Americans population with "a feeling of almost repulsion"
and is relieved when told that these people "were of the
lower class" (Johnson, 1912/1970, pp. 55-56). Furthermore,
the narrator privileges class distinction over race distinction.
For example, he says that "refined coloured people get no
more pleasure out of riding [in segregated train cars] with
offensive Negroes than anybody else would get" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 81) and claims that his experience has taught
him that class means more than race: "When one has seen
something of the world and human nature, one must con-
clude, after all, that between people in like stations of life
there is very little difference the world over" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 85).
However, ultimately, in neither his classist nor White
experience traveling around Europe with his "patron" is the
narrator making a wholly authentic choice of identity. It can
be argued that although the narrator learns about different
cultures and languages, he is, like the patron, essentially sim-
ply living in fallenness. Heidegger outlines three characteris-
tics of the existential of fallenness: "idle talk, ambiguity, and
curiosity" (quoted in Gelven, 1989, p. 106). The patron
exhibits all three. Although the patron is somewhat distant
and restrained, he is among the White "slummers" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 116) who frequent the Black ragtime club, and
he throws extravagant dinner parties at his apartment so that
he is constantly surrounded by "idle," or inconsequential,
"talk." He lives in ambiguity in the Heideggerian sense that
he refuses to make clear plans or decisions, as seen in his
response when the narrator asks him how long he proposes to
stay in Paris: "Oh, until I get tired of it" (Johnson, 1912/1970,
p. 130). And last, the patron displays the curiosity that dis-
tracts one from one's own life through voyeurism--"He
seemed to take cynical delight in watching and studying oth-
ers indulging in excess" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 118)--and
in decadence--his crowd "were people . . . who were ever
expecting to find happiness in novelty, each day restlessly
exploring and exhausting every resource of [New York] that
might possibly furnish a new sensation or awaken a fresh
emotion . . . " (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 119). To the extent,
then, that the narrator shares the patron's way of life while he
is with him and admires him--as he does: "I looked upon
him . . . as about all a man could wish to be" (Johnson,
12 SAGE Open
1912/1970, p. 121)--the ex-colored man also lives in the idle
talk, ambiguity, and curiosity that constitute fallenness.
The narrator appears to break through this state of fallen-
ness when he has what seems to be an epiphany, after a
German musician at one of the patron's parties transposes the
narrator's ragtime number into classical form, that he can do
the same in a more comprehensive manner, thereby becom-
ing the "great coloured man" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 46) he
dreamed of as a boy. He decides to return to the south to
"drink in . . . inspiration" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 142) from
ragtime and "the old slave songs" (Johnson, 1912/1970,
p. 143). However, he never succeeds in this breakthrough to
authentic selfhood for several reasons. First, when he goes to
the south, he still maintains the "white gaze" that he had dur-
ing his first trip; if anything, it has become even narrower
because of his time passing as a White American in Europe
and his acculturation into White European society. For
example, in conversing with a young male schoolteacher that
he meets while studying African American spirituals at the
religious "big meeting" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 182), the
narrator notes that he and "the majority of intelligent coloured
people are . . . too much in earnest over the race question . . .
are unable to see things in their proper proportions . . . " and
should "exercise [a] sense of humour" about "their present
and future" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 183). Second, although
he explicitly censures White musicians who make money
from popularizing as their own the music of Black ragtime
musicians, his venture to re-work the old slave songs for his
own glory and profit, represents, as Goellnicht (1996) notes,
"the very thievery he had been critical of white musicians
for" (p. 27). Third, he has a fundamental lack of respect for
the very music and culture, and therefore for a part of his
own heritage, that he plans to appropriate for his benefit. For
instance, he transcribes "themes and melodies" as he attempts
"to catch the spirit of the Negro in his relatively primitive
state" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 173) and, at the big meeting,
finds the "preacher's words" to be "primitive poetry"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 177). Last, he decides calculatingly
that he can be more successful as a Black man performing
this music than as a White man: " . . . I settled the question
purely on selfish grounds . . . I should have greater chances
of attracting attention as a coloured composer than as a white
one" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 147).
Finally, of course, the narrator becomes the ex-colored
man intentionally, and it could be argued that such an act is,
by definition, authentic. He says, following his witnessing of
the burning alive of an African American man in rural
Georgia, that his motivation for making the decision is that
he feels "shame, unbearable shame. Shame at being identi-
fied with a people that could with impunity be treated worse
than animals" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 191). But this motiva-
tion seems to mesh conveniently with another motivation
that has been consistent throughout the narrator's life,
namely, his desire for social and economic success. He
describes himself as a boy as "a perfect little aristocrat"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 7) who is told by his mother to
expect that his father, "one of the greatest men in the coun-
try" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 18), will someday "make a
great man" (Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 38) of him. So when he
learns of his mixed-race background, he shifts to "wild
dreams of bringing glory and honour to the Negro race"
(Johnson, 1912/1970, p. 46). However, this shift is artificial;
he maintains throughout his life the attitudes and perspective
of White society. So it is consistent with that perspective that,
when he witnesses the horror of the burning of Black men, he
quickly reverts to the rationale "that to forsake one's race to
better one's condition was no less worthy an action than to
forsake one's country for the same purpose" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 190), which he has already done. Of course, he
himself has already shown through the numerous examples
of "people of education and culture and . . . means" (Johnson,
1912/1970, p. 152) that he meets that success, at least to an
extent, is possible for some African Americans like himself.
What his decision to adopt a wholly White identity actually
represents is his retreat into a kind of fallenness through his
immersion into the "they-self" of White society, this immer-
sion emphasized by his lack of a distinct name. In so doing,
he also denies his heritage. Together, living in fallenness and
denying that aspect of his own thrownness, a part of his heri-
tage, that helps make him what he is results in his living
inauthentically.
Attempting to live authentically can serve as a kind of
healing of the divisions of identity that characterize the social
marginalization that Phillip Brian Harper (1994) recognizes
as similar to postmodern crises of identity. In truth, the
acknowledgment, in Heideggerian terms, the understanding,
of all elements of one's facticity allows for the broadening of
the horizon of possible action for one's future. The color line
and an individual's place in relation to it, then, continue to be
central aspects of American life as depicted in African
American novels of racial passing. What it means to be Black
or White is complex, and for those who are able by virtue of
nuance to choose which side of the color line they want to be
on, the choice is profound.8 In Heideggerian terms, although
one may be able to perform a social identity that ignores a
part of one's heritage, one does so at the real peril of losing
part of the horizon of one's authentic being.

Notes
1. In making the observations and arguments that I do in this
article, I am keenly aware of the problem that Sartwell (1998)
continuously highlights throughout his book, namely, that even
Cullum 13
by trying to analyze works of African American narrative, a
White academic becomes a part of, and agent for, a "system
which constantly seeks to empower itself over [an oppressed
people] by revealing them, by `understanding' them" (p. 32).
In "The Problem of Speaking for Others," Linda Martin Alcoff
(1991-1992) portrays this problem in structural terms for
anthropology through quoting anthropologist Trinh T. Min-ha,
but the terms can apply to any academic discipline:
Anthropology is "maintaining a conversation of `us' with `us'
about `them,' of the white man with the white man about the
primitive-nature man . . . in which Them" is silenced. "Them"
always stands on the other side of the hill, naked and speech-
less . . . "them" is only admitted among "us," the discussing
subjects, when accompanied or introduced by an "us." Given
this analysis, even ethnographies written by progressive
anthropologists are a priori regressive because of the structural
features of anthropological discursive practice. (p. 98)
Alcoff goes on to discuss several possible approaches to minimiz-
ing this structural problem of any speaking about others becoming
a speaking for others,
For in both the practice of speaking for and the practice of
speaking about others, I am engaging in the act of representing
the others' needs, goals, situation, and in fact, who they are
based on my own situated interpretation. (pp. 100-101, empha-
sis in original)
Finally, the approach that Alcoff ascribes to Donna Haraway that
speaking should always carry with it an accountability and
responsibility for what an individual says through the process
of discursive action . . . a serious commitment to remain open
to criticism and attempt to "hear" the criticism (i.e., understand
it). (pp. 112-113)
That approach is the one that I subscribe to and that, in a journal
in an online format, seems to be most responsive to any infelicities
that others may find in this article.
2. In this use of concepts of Heidegger, I acknowledge the
Eurocentric nature of his entire methodology, namely, that
his "efforts to draw upon the reflections of the pre-Socratics
for a more direct engagement with beings themselves" valo-
rizes the western bias that "the Greeks invented philosophy"
("Introduction" in Gordon, 2008). As Lewis R. Gordon (2008)
explains,
critics [of this view] have shown that this notion was a cre-
ation of European Renaissance intellectuals, many of whom
wanted a connection to a classical past that brought coherence
to the rapidly changing world that was eventually created by
the age of modern exploration (which began in the fifteenth
century and ended in the late eighteenth century) or the scram-
ble to reach India, which was in medieval times regarded by
Mediterranean peoples as the center of the world. Being west
of center, it was their hope to find a short cut around a believed-
smaller globe. The commerce stimulated by the shift to the
Atlantic Ocean decimated the status of the Mediterranean as a
site of sea trade, and the realization of continents to the west
that were not Asian led to a literally new "orientation" of those
people's perspective. Once west of the center, the new align-
ment created a geological and political shift in which a new
"center" was born . . . Europeans began to forget that there
was not always a Europe . . . The European began to develop
a sense of the self in which there was supposedly a primal
Mythical exemplification of wisdom itself, and the place that
became the epitome of this sense of self became Hellenic civi-
lization, a place whose foundational role took racialized form
in nineteenth-century scholarship on the history of philosophy.
("Introduction")
Heidegger's own phenomenological approach to philosophy cer-
tainly follows this Hellenic-centered and European bias. For exam-
ple, in the "Letter on Humanism," Heidegger (1977) makes the
following observation: "All of [Europe's] thinking . . . is falling
behind in the essential course of a dawning world destiny which
nevertheless in its essential provenance remains European by defi-
nition" (p. 244). However, I would maintain that the fact that he saw
his work as breaking away from traditional metaphysics makes his
insights different from, and helpful in cracking at least some of the
accretions of, Western thought.
3. Zackodnik (2010) outlines the duality of contemporary criti-
cal views on the trope of passing as either complicit or sub-
versive. Passing is an act of complicity in the sense that the
passer acts within the dominant social structure of the rigid,
binary racial categories of Black or White. To pass for White is
thus to accept and perpetuate that racial structure. At the other
extreme, passing is an act of subversion because the ability of
the passer to shift from one racial category to another raises
the question of the validity of those very categories. Zackodnik
(2010) then defines her project against these opposites by
asserting that
the mulatta's ambiguous racial identity has made her an ideal
figure through which African American women have exposed
the racialization of gender, sexuality, and class in American
society, as well as the ambivalence of passing in ways that go
beyond the simple duality of subversive versus complicit acts.
(p. xi)
4. Hannah's immediate motivation in coming to this mode of
understanding is seen as problematic. She seems to rebel more
against the prospect of living with field slaves than to the con-
dition of slavery itself when she refers to Bill as "one, whose
person, speech, and manner could not fail to be ever regarded
by me with loathing and disgust" and the other field slaves as
"dirty, obscene, and degraded objects" (Crafts, 2002, p. 213).
Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s (2002) conclusion is that Hannah "is a
snob . . . but she is not a racist" (p. lxxxii). At the other end of
the critical spectrum, Celeste-Marie Bernier and Judie Newman
(2005) find that Hannah's "disgust" at the prospect of marry-
ing Bill "substantiates her racist overtones" (p. 162). In fact,
her "racist" reaction to Bill is one of a number of reasons that
Bernier and Newman give in suggesting that Hannah may be a
White immigrant servant rather than anAfricanAmerican slave.
5. DuBois (1899/1967) actually discusses five "social develop-
ments" that led to strained relations in Philadelphia and the
14 SAGE Open
north: the industrial revolution, the economic recovery from
the War of 1812, the increase in foreign immigration, the
increase in both free African Americans and fugitive slaves,
and the escalation of the issue of slavery and the Abolitionist
movement.
6. Douglass (1845/2001) finds that White workers in New
Bedford have much the same prejudice and fear of losing jobs
to free African Americans as the White workers in Baltimore.
7. Eve Allegra Raimon (2004), in The "Tragic Mulatta"
Revisited: Race and Nationalism in Nineteenth-Century
Antislavery Fiction, discusses miscegenation, passing,
and the mulatta figure in the context of frontier expansion,
nationalism, and a growing and lightening African American
population in the United States. In the process, Raimon, like
Zackodnik (2010), sees the mulatta figure as more complex
than a stereotype of sentimental, or "women's," fiction or as
an emblem of an author's assimilationist sympathies. Instead,
Raimon (2004) finds that the figure "signif[ies] the depth of
social and political disruptions antebellum America was fac-
ing in the coextensive arenas of racial formation and national
expansion" (p. 12). Raimon, then, also sees passing as having
a weight tied to something outside of the individual's choice of
behavior, in her case, that weight being the whole of the devel-
oping national character of the still youthful United States.
8. The act of racial passing can be seen as analogous to the
power of language itself in creating freedom. Lewis R.
Gordon (2000) discusses this power--specifically, as writ-
ing--in the context of Africana philosophy in his Existentia
Africana. Gordon (2000) places Africana studies into an anal-
ogy to Shakespeare's The Tempest in the sense of the charac-
ter of Caliban as the colonized object in relation to Prospero's
European colonization of the island and also, as the offspring
of a witch and the devil, as the ultimate "other," or, quoting
Gayatri Spivak, "subaltern," figure to the western European
Prospero, and so analogizes African studies as "Caliban stud-
ies" (pp. 2-3):
Africana thought, as a form of Caliban studies, raises ironic
self-reflexive metatheoretical questions. Think, for example,
of the importance of writing as a form of intellectual produc-
tion. Because of the emancipatory aims ofAfricana thought (as
a form of Caliban studies), the activity of writing ascends here
to the level of praxis . . . The theoretical explorations that dom-
inate today's formulations emerge through engagement with
writing . . . Yet, like Caliban, modern Africana thinkers' use of
. . . language is infused with forces of magic. They represent
disruptions and rupture. We could imagine an alternative read-
ing of Caliban as a being who had his mother's knowledge,
which he could fuse with Prospero's knowledge. This fusion
could offer what [C.L.R.] James has characterized as "creative
universality," that which, because it always raises possibility,
constitutes freedom . . . these questions have been struggled
with throughout the nineteenth, and most of the twentieth, cen-
turies. (pp. 3-4, emphasis in original)
My position in this article, clearly, has been close to Gordon's
(2000) point that at "the level of praxis" (p. 3; emphasis added),
racial passing, like writing, offers a means of escape from the
constraints of racial discrimination and inhumanity. If, as is obvi-
ously the case, the person doing the racial passing must accept the
fact that there exist categories of racial identification to transgress
them, then, increasingly and, as I have argued, for reasons that shift
from necessary for survival to existentially open, across African
American novels of the 19th and into the 20th centuries, that is the
choice that the authors I have discussed have made.
