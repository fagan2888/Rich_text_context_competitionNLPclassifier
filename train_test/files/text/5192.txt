Introduction
According to the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of
Texas (CPRIT; 2010), breast cancer is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
mortality among women in Texas. In addition, more than
half of the breast cancer deaths in the state occur in for
Dallas­Fort Worth area, San Antonio, and Houston (Harris
County). This highlights the disparities in urban locations,
rather than rural, within the state (CPRIT, 2010). As noted by
the Texas Cancer Registry (2014), from 2007 to 2011, the
age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer was 1.16 times
higher among non-Hispanic White women in Harris County,
compared with African Americans. However, the age-
adjusted mortality rate was nearly 1.7 times higher among
African American women in the county, compared to their
White counterparts.
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
data in 2010 noted among those completing the questionnaire
across the state, approximately 74% of African American
women aged 40 and above stated they had a mammogram
within the past 2 years (Center for Health Statistics [CHS],
2010). This is compared with 71% of White women. However,
taking into account the level of income only, all women making
less than US$15,000 a year had an adherence percentage of 58,
and 63 for those within the US$15,000 to US$24,999 income
range (CHS, 2010). Based on these statistics and the historical
marginalization of African American women in society and
health (Barbee & Little, 1993; Collins, 2000; Hooks, 2005),
there is a need to address the cultural nuances (i.e., traditions,
history, language) of African American women.
African American Women and Cultural
Competence
In the context of race and ethnicity stratification, it is impor-
tant to address the cultural nuances for not only African
Americans, but for all people of color through the employment

Abstract
Breast cancer mortality has affected African American women at a disproportionate rate. The purpose of this research was
to assess how health professionals' cultural competence contributes to African American women's barriers to and receipt
of mammograms. Sixty-one African American women residing in Harris County, Texas, shared their views within a series
of focus groups. Theoretical propositions from the PEN-3 model were used to understand mammography adherence at
the interpersonal level. Participants noted various perceived factors associated with mammography incompliance. Lack of
professionalism of clinicians and clerical staff contributed to a decrease in health care services utilization. In addition, cultural
insensitivity and discriminatory behavior enabled an attitude of medical mistrust. Improving patient­provider communication,
through culturally appropriate centered educational efforts, is a beneficial strategy for breast health programs among
underserved populations.

of cultural competence (Harvard Catalyst, 2010).Accordingly,
cultural competence refers to awareness of unique characteris-
tics of the populations for which health professionals provide
care (Harvard Catalyst, 2010). In health care settings, cultural
competence is defined as the ability of systems to provide care
to patients with diverse values, beliefs, and behaviors
(Betancourt et al., 2005). This includes tailoring delivery to
meet patients' social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Cultural
competence is both a vehicle to increase access to quality care
for all patients and as a business strategy to attract new patients
through effective communication (Betancourt et al., 2005).
Culture influences the community's views toward health, pov-
erty, welfare, crime, and other social and human services
areas, in addition to outcomes of public agency services and
interventions (Rice, 2007). Understanding these concepts
enables public service delivery providers to avoid stereotypes
and biases, as well as promote positive characteristics of par-
ticular groups (Rice, 2007).
In addition, the notion of trust is also a factor in the delivery
of health services. Researchers conducted telephone surveys
to explore the correlation between preventive health service
engagement and trust in the competence of physicians' care
(Musa, Schulz, Harris, Silverman, & Thomas, 2009). African
Americans reported being less trustful of their physician com-
pared with Whites. Subsequently, this lack of trust was associ-
ated with decreased adherence to routine examinations,
including mammograms (Musa et al., 2009). It was also deter-
mined that an individual's level of distrust of the health care
system can be used to predict her breast cancer screening
schedule adherence (Katapodi, Pierce, & Facione, 2010).
Research suggests cultural competence training directly
affects the attitudes of health care providers (Beach et al.,
2005). Organizations and institutions have addressed this by
providing academic course instruction to students and
employer-sponsored training for practitioners (Hall, Guidry,
McKyer, Outley, & Ballard, 2014). Improving patient­pro-
vider communication may eliminate the disconnect between
the two, thus improving health outcomes. Although there has
been extensive review and subsequent recommendations
offered for the development of a universal, interdisciplinary
curriculum to build the capacity of providers, there is not a
consensus on the approach (Smith et al., 2007). The purpose
of this research study was to understand African American
women's perceptions of health care providers' delivery of
culturally competent services, and how delivery contributes
to barriers to and receipt of mammograms. The information
obtained can be used to develop a comprehensive curriculum
for those working in the health care field and providing care
to African American women in this region.
Theoretical/Conceptual Framework
For this study, researchers used the PEN-3 model. Introduced
as an alternative to the traditional medical model, it is based on
various components, including reasoned action, PRECEDE,
and health belief models (Airhihenbuwa, 1995). Its premise is
to identify and address individual, family, community, and
systemic influential factors of health behavior modification
(Ka'Opua, 2008). Regarding intervention development, the
framework identifies and organizes the cultural components of
the target population within the planning phase to ensure
effectiveness (Cowdery, Parker, & Thompson, 2012).
The model is composed of three dimensions: cultural
identity, cultural empowerment, and relationships and expec-
tations. Cultural identity focuses on the person, the extended
family, and the neighborhood. Cultural empowerment
explores beliefs about health that are positive, existential, or
negative in nature (Iwelunmor, Newsome, & Airhihenbuwa,
2014). The final dimension of relationships and expectations
involves three variables, which are perceptions, enablers,
and nurturers (Airhihenbuwa, 1995).
PEN-3 model is highly applicable to specific populations,
particularly to subgroups within the African American com-
munity (Airhihenbuwa, 1995). Research indicates that the
PEN-3 model has been used to explore the cultural and com-
munity-related impact on African Americans' food choices,
dietary intake, and nutritional attitudes (James, 2004).
Successful outcomes of this effort included the development
of effective components of nutrition education programs and
health communication strategies (James, 2004). The PEN-3
model was also used to address cultural issues related to psy-
chosocial barriers and factors of prostate cancer screening
(Abernethy et al., 2005). The findings from these studies
suggested building partnerships with the community in
health promotion efforts is a key factor of recruitment and
subsequent behavior adoption (Abernethy et al., 2005).
Researchers also have incorporated dimensions of PEN-3
model to adapt breast cancer education materials to achieve
the inclusion of culturally sensitive messages focusing on
medical mistrust, self-reliance, spirituality, and community
influences (Kline, 2007). However, a systematic review of
the application of the PEN-3 model revealed there are very
few studies aimed at breast cancer in minority women that
incorporate all dimensions of the PEN-3 model (Iwelunmor
et al., 2014). Within the current study, the relationships and
expectations dimension was utilized to assess the lack of cul-
turally relevant/appropriate services and improve health
communication, as well as messaging. In turn, this will facil-
itate the efforts of developing a supportive health care envi-
ronment conducive to increasing healthy outcomes for
minority populations.
Similarly, Sheppard et al. (2010) explored the relation-
ships and expectations dimension of the PEN-3 model in
developing a decision­support intervention for African
American breast cancer survivors. The findings assisted in
the development of strategies to promote improved patient­
provider communication. In addition, the dimension has
guided studies conducted through focus groups and in-depth
interviews among Latinas to create culturally competent
breast and cervical cancer screening programs, and treatment
Hall et al. 3
decision making (Erwin, Johnson, Feliciano-Libid, Zamora,
& Jandorf, 2005; Garcés, Scarinci, & Harrison, 2006;
Sheppard et al., 2008).
The current study sought to expand on the utilization of
this culturally appropriate research model to assist with pro-
gram development, designed specifically for African
American women in Harris County, Texas. As indicative of
true community-based participatory research strategies,
researchers must actively seek information to gain insights
regarding the cultural, demographic, and geographic nuances
of those targeted for health interventions/programs. By doing
this, the likelihood of an increase in healthful outcomes and
lifestyle change is strengthened (Horowitz, Robinson, &
Seifer, 2009).
Materials and Method
Participants
Study inclusion criteria included: (a) female, (b) between 35
and 65 years of age, (c) current resident of Harris County, (d)
self-identified African American, (e) English speaker, and (f)
no previous history of cancer. There were a total of six focus
groups conducted with 61 African American women across
the Houston/Harris County, Texas area.
Recruitment
To recruit participants, researchers first identified regions of
large proportions of African American persons that were
within a 10-mile radius of each service center. This included
145 grocery stores, local community centers, multiservice,
churches, centers, shopping centers, hair salons, and restau-
rants. At each location, significant efforts were made to per-
sonally interact with potential participants, or with any
person willing to speak with the designated staffer. Personal
interaction included, as often as possible, matching the
racial/ethnic identity of the staffer with the potential partici-
pant. The staffer then would greet the person, introduce him
or herself, and proceed to hand the person a flyer which
included focus group information and begin to inform them
of the study purpose. Questions were answered immediately
if the person had any, and if they were interested in partici-
pating, the person's name and phone number were collected
for follow-up.
When personal interaction was not appropriate, allowed,
or available, a flyer was left on cars, in windows, on tables,
or wherever the establishment would allow us to leave them.
At the end of each recruitment activity, all interested parties'
names and contact information were placed in an Excel file
on an institution-provided, encrypted, password-protected
computer. Follow-up calls to potential participants would
begin at least 48 hrs before the scheduled date of the focus
group. In the event contact was not made, follow-up would
continue until 3 hrs prior to the starting time.
Procedure
Of the 11 available multiservice centers, all were contacted,
but due to scheduling conflicts, closings due to construction,
and available space constraints, 5 city service centers were
available to host the focus groups. An additional sixth loca-
tion was included to better accommodate potential partici-
pants in the far northwest locations of the county. One focus
group was conducted at each location. These locations were
selected because they are representative of the geographic
districts within the city/county. Due to the high population,
researchers sought to maximize the variety of representation
among the target population by offering the assessments in
easily accessible settings within close residential proximity.
There were a total of six facilitators, with one being
assigned to each focus group. The background of the facilita-
tors included graduate training in public health, health
administration, health care management, and social work.
All facilitators participated in a single training session to
familiarize them with the focus group facilitator guide and
appropriate facilitation techniques.
At the beginning of every focus group, all attendees were
reminded that participation in the focus group was strictly
voluntary and they could choose not to continue participating
at any time. Participants were then walked through the
informed consent process, which included a few designated
minutes for the focus group facilitator to read aloud the con-
sent documentation and to answer any questions. Afterward,
additional time was allotted to allow participants to reread the
documentation for themselves and to ask the facilitator any
additional questions privately. Once participants were ade-
quately informed and felt comfortable consenting to partici-
pate in the focus group, they were then asked to complete a
basic demographic questionnaire. Participants were also
informed they would receive a US$25 gift card to a national
department store chain for participating in the focus group.
Each focus group was recorded with a digital recorder.
Participants were instructed to not use their names at any time
during the focus group to further ensure anonymity. The
research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Interview Guide
To guide the focus group and to ensure consistency and accu-
racy between the different groups, each facilitator utilized a
designated interview guide. Each focus group ranged between
60 and 90 mins, in which the African American women were
asked about their understanding and beliefs of breast cancer
health and perceptions toward breast cancer services. More
specifically, the women were asked to address their (a) knowl-
edge of breast health (e.g., need for routine breast cancer
examinations through the combination of self-examinations
and doctor examinations), (b) availability and accessibility of
breast health services (e.g., ideal locations to receive
4 SAGE Open
a mammogram; health services info dissemination), and (c)
utilization of breast health services (e.g., understanding how
breast health services could be utilized more effectively; bar-
riers to service). These areas included specific questions such
as the following: (a) "What would be the most effective way
to let African American women know about breast cancer and
available breast health services?", (b) "What are some ways
that we may be able to reduce some of the barriers/challenges
that African American women face to getting a mammo-
gram?" and (c) "Why do you think some African American
women go for mammograms and why some do not?". The
information provided was indicative of research-based, cul-
ture-based, and individual experiential knowledge that incor-
porates the components of the PEN-3 framework.
Data Analysis
Each of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim. Following
this, and to avoid researcher biases, a team of three researchers
independently analyzed, categorized, and coded participants'
responses into themes utilizing inductive­deductive content
analysis method (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Inductive analysis
allowed the researchers to immerse themselves in the tran-
scripts and determine relevant themes, whereas deductive
analysis allowed the researchers to explore the categories
based on the theoretical components of the PEN-3 model.
NVivo qualitative analysis computer software enabled this
process. Specifically, key participant responses were selected
and given a color code using the software (McIlfatrick,
Taggart, & Truesdale-Kennedy, 2011). Codes were then gath-
ered into specific themes and analyzed individually. On com-
pletion, researchers came together to compare and contrast
analyses and determine final categories and themes.
Results
From the demographic questionnaire, it was determined the
average age of the women in the focus groups was approxi-
mately 52 years, and 36% of the women (n = 22) were divor-
cees with an average number of 2 children. Thirteen percent
of the participants (n = 8) had a high school diploma or gen-
eral educational development (GED) certificate, and 15%
(n = 9) reported having vocational training after high school
completion. Forty-one percent (n = 25) had some college or
an associate's degree, 13% (n = 8) had a baccalaureate
degree, and 2% (n = 1) reported completing a master's pro-
gram. Fifty-one percent of the women (n = 31) were unem-
ployed, yet 38% (n = 23) reported having private insurance,
and 43% (n = 26) reported an annual income of less than
US$20,000. Seventy-seven percent of women (n = 47)
reported not having a family history of breast cancer, with
79% (n = 48) having ever received a mammogram.
The purpose of this research study was to understand
African American women's perceptions of health care pro-
viders' delivery of culturally competent services, and how
delivery contributes to barriers to and receipt of mammo-
grams. Through the focus groups, the 61 African American
women articulated their perceptions and experiences with
health care workers. The findings revealed perceptions of the
(a) interactions with clinicians, (b) attitudes of insensitivity
by the physicians and nurse practitioners, and (c) inequitable
treatment for sickness and diseases.
Therefore, the women revealed that prior to an interaction
with a clinician,AfricanAmerican women are intimidated by
clerical workers' perceived indignant attitudes and lack of
respect toward them. This initial interaction sets the tone for
the entire visit, often times hindering communication efforts
and return for services (Kaplan et al., 2006).
They are intimidated by the people who initiated the services.
They don't necessarily get into the doctor's office being
intimidated; it is the people before you get in the door. It is the
attitude of the service care providers that turn away a lot of the
people that come that use a lot of energy. They take the time to
either car-ride with someone, and pay that person and then to
find a way back and then they get there and they get this person
with an attitude, you know? As if you are nobody.
It is when they are trying to get the application, trying to get the
information, trying to say why you are there. The person is telling
you what they want to tell you and it is kind of indignant . . .
When I first started coming over here to the Health Center, I
needed a mammogram, I just almost fought with the lady over
there, from that day on I promised myself: "I'm never going to a
city health clinic again." And I've never been back in there,
because they act around like they have authority over there; they
act like it is their building, as a matter of fact, the whole system
has got a problem with the attitude. It does not matter how poor
you are or what you got 'cuz we don't know what the people that
work there have either. But they still need to respect the people
that come here.
Based on the responses, the participants' initial interac-
tions consisted of negative attitudes in the form of intimida-
tion, confrontation, and indignant/offensive treatment by
clerical staff at the clinics and personnel who work with
patients (e.g., facilitating transportation, completion of patient
applications). The negative attitudes affected the participants
and situated their perception of future interactions with the
clinic and its personnel (e.g., nurse practitioner, physician).
Although the initial interactions set the tone for future vis-
its to the clinician, some of the women experienced similar
interactions with the primary physician/clinician and the
nurse practitioner. As such, the issue of physician and nurse
insensitivity was also raised during the discussion. The par-
ticipants noted their discontent with the clinicians' and nurse
practitioners' insensitivity that consisted of a perceived lack
of warmth and care.
Well you asked me if the doctors were not paying attention, they
need to be more professional. Not only the doctors and the staff,
Hall et al. 5
the nurses, you know some people are very insensitive and make
us feel, you know, less than what we are, you know. Because I'm
coming here to you, I am putting my life in your hands, if I can't
communicate with you and you just throw me off.
. . . he started not listening but like he didn't really want to touch
me. And the worst thing that he did was do a, I let him do a well
woman's Pap one time. Then I said to myself I won't ever, ever
come back to another man doctor first of all and especially a
white doctor because he was not sensitive at all.
The participants conveyed that the clinicians' (e.g., doc-
tors, physicians) and nurses' perceived lack of warmth and
care was based on their inability to communicate in a "pro-
fessional" manner. One participant conveyed the signifi-
cance of her interaction as it pertained to her "putting my life
in your hands," and thus, felt a certain level of sensitivity was
necessary for diagnosis and effective communication
between her, the clinician, and nurse practitioner. Although
another participant conveyed poor verbal communication
was received, the non-verbal communication was perceived
as more insensitive. This participant's physical interaction
with the physician was negatively perceived when she felt
that "he didn't really want to touch me" during her intimate
and invasive examination. Therefore, verbal and non-verbal
communications are both deemed important to these partici-
pants during the doctor­patient interactions.
The interactions and perceived attitudes contributed to the
final area of concern for these participants. Through the
focus groups, the participants conveyed their beliefs that the
clinicians were not providing equitable treatment for all
groups of patients due to a lack of treating sickness and dis-
eases within the African American community.
I don't trust them because I believe that they are not treating
African Americans aggressively with sickness and disease as
they do with the white people and there are a lot of the seniors
who distrust them. I can name a group of people that are right in
this area, y'all would know who they are, and they said they let
them cut them or experiment on them, because I believe that is
happening, these woman with fibroids and they are allowing
those things to grow in these women.
They let it get out of whack. They are letting things grow on
women. But I find that a lot of minorities are going through . . .
because it is not aggressively addressed while that person is
going to the doctor, it is not.And people have just stopped going.
The culminating affect of the perceived lack of treating
African Americans who are sick or stricken with diseases
fueled one participant's sense of mistrust and willingness to
consult with a physician for future health concerns and/or to
adhere to health screening recommendations, while another
participant presented that African Americans, and other peo-
ple of color, are experiencing similar levels of treatment or
non-treatment. She concludes that the low levels of treatment
or non-treatment cultivate an environment in which African
Americans choose not to go to doctors.
Discussion
This article proposed to examine the influence of perceived
health professionals' cultural competence on barriers to and
receipt of mammograms among African American women.
Using the relationships and expectations dimension of the
PEN-3 model was highly applicable in examining the influ-
ential factors associated with the health care system in mam-
mography adherence choices. Again, this dimension
encompasses three variables to include perceptions, enablers,
and nurturers. The findings revealed that (a) African
American women's perceptions reaffirmed notions of his-
torical mistrust, (b) lack of sensitivity and respect by person-
nel acted as a negative enabler of health care services
utilization decision making, and (c) health care providers and
staff can act as nurturers in this setting, enabling screening
and follow-up adherence.
The perception variable asserts that culturally influenced
attitudes and beliefs can either encourage or impede healthy
behaviors (Abernethy et al., 2005). Hence, the noted percep-
tion among focus group participants included medical mis-
trust due to lack of respect from medical professionals. This
could be contributed to sociodemographic factors such as
socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and health lit-
eracy (Davis, Bynum, Katz, Buchanan, & Green, 2012). For
example, the perception that medical practitioners do not
want to touch the participants may be a derivative of per-
sonal and cultural preconceptions about how people of color
with low social class status address personal hygiene or other
health-related care. Concomitantly, other factors contribut-
ing to participant perceptions could consist of the experience
and tenure of medical professionals. Medical professionals
who are nervous working with the underserved populations
(i.e., people of color, low income) and/or are new in their
careers and lack experience interacting with these individu-
als may exhibit behaviors (i.e., verbal, non-verbal) that could
be viewed as intentional. The verbal and non-verbal behavior
communication cues act as negative enablers of health infor-
mation and treatment seeking among underserved popula-
tions (Perloff, Bonder, Ray, Ray, & Siminoff, 2006).
The findings illuminated how medical professionals'
behaviors could act as enablers. Enablers are positive or
negative systematic, social, and/or cultural forces, which
influence health behaviors (Abernethy et al., 2005). Thus,
the voices of the participants conveyed that improvement,
perhaps in the forms of education and training, could aid
medical professionals with culturally competent knowledge,
understanding, and interactions. Such improvements may
modify the cultural perceptions of underserved populations
and could diminish distrust for the medical system (Hall,
Guidry, McKyer, Outley, & Ballard, 2013). This can be
achieved through organization-led continuing education to
improve effectiveness in working with diverse patients (Hall
et al., 2013). Failure to address cultural incompetence of
medical professionals can result in decreased utilization of
medical and health care services, thereby contributing to
6 SAGE Open
health inequities and disparities among minority popula-
tions (Hall et al., 2013).
Second, because of the strong spiritual foundation men-
tioned by the focus group participants, medical practitioners
and researchers should partner with faith-based organiza-
tions, to act as nurturing settings to implement education and
cultural awareness strategies to promote beneficial interac-
tions (Abernethy et al., 2005). The variable of nurturing is
defined as members of one's social network who assist in
mediating health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes (Abernethy
et al., 2005). Thus, faith-based organizations, such as
churches, are beneficial sites or safe spaces (Collins, 2000)
for conducting interventions with underserved populations to
build their capacity to effectively communicate with medical
professionals for health information and treatment seeking
(Matthews, Sellergren, Manfredi, & Williams, 2002). In
addition, the findings suggested that health care providers
can act as nurturers in health settings by being sensitive to
the needs, questions, and concerns of patients.
Strengths and Limitations
There are notable strengths of the study, which include
detailed recruitment and consent protocols, as well as find-
ings analysis incorporating evidence-based transcription and
coding methods. Although the research team proactively
addressed potential barriers to data collection procedures,
more extensive and precise strategies of moderator training
will be implemented in future projects. These include evi-
dence-based training materials addressing the avoidance of
interjecting personal opinions by moderators, as well as
approaches to keep participants focused on the questions
stated in the moderator guide. The research team will also
conduct a series of mock focus groups with moderators to
provide them with application experience prior to data col-
lection activities.
Conclusion
Consistent with published research, focus group participants
conveyed various negative experiences with health care pro-
fessionals. These included insensitivity, lack of professional-
ism, and poor communication. Possessing compassion and
being personable are qualities conducive to increasing health
services utilization and adherence to recommended guideline
schedules within minority populations. As expressed within
the PEN-3 framework, this study adds to the literature of cul-
tural exploration of influential factors of individual and com-
munity-based behavior modification needing to be addressed
to ensure effective minority-focused program/intervention
planning and implementation activities.
