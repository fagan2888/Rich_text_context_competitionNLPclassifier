Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common renal com-
plication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of kidney
failure, accounting for 44% of all new cases of kidney failure
in the United States in 2008.1 DN is characterized by func-
tional and structural changes in the kidney such as progres-
sive proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial
fibrosis, with over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) playing an important role.2
Currently, drugs targeting RAAS, including angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II
(AngII) type I receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) and aldos-
terone blockers have been most widely used for slowing
down or preventing renal damage in diabetes. However,
they are not completely effective in preventing or reversing
the development of DN3,4, in part due to a compensatory
increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) and AngII, which
may potentially overrideARB blockade ofAT1R. Inhibition
of renin, a rate-limiting step in the RAAS activation cas-
cade, provides an additional approach and the potential for
achieving a full blockade of RAAS activity by suppressing
production of AngI and AngII; meanwhile, renin inhibition
may be also associated with reduced production of angio-
tensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)], as a positive component in RAAS
cascade, antagonizing effects of angiotensin II in the dia-
betic kidneys.
Aliskiren as a direct renin inhibitor through combination
with other RAAS blockade has shown protective renal and
cardiac effects in human and animal diabetes.5­10 Work

Abstract
Aim: We investigated whether aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, provided protection in a model of diabetic nephropathy
in mice and compared its protective effects to valsartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.
Materials and methods: Hyperglycemia was induced with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg/day × 5 days) injection in
DBA/2J mice fed on a high fat diet. Mice were treated with either aliskiren (25 mg/kg/day) or valsartan (8 mg/kg/day) for
6 weeks.
Results: Aliskiren and/or valsartan treatment significantly attenuated albuminuria, urinary nephrin excretion and glo-
merulosclerosis. Aliskiren and/or valsartan prevented reduction of podocin and WT1 protein abundance in diabetic
mice. Aliskiren and/or valsartan significantly prevented increased expression of profibrotic growth factors (TGF, CTGF
and PAI-1), proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, TNF and IL-1), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (CHOP
and XBP-1) and lipid accumulation in the kidney of diabetic animals. Aliskiren showed similar efficacy compared to val-
sartan therapy and dual treatment in some aspects has synergistic protective effects.
Conclusion: Our study indicates that aliskiren and/or valsartan protects against diabetic kidney disease through multiple
mechanisms, including decreasing podocyte injury, activation of profibrotic growth factors and proinflammatory cyto-
kines, ER stress and accumulation of lipids.

db and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I DN supports
that combination of aliskiren and valsartan led to greater
reduction in proteinuria and prevented glomerular and
tubular injury compared to either intervention alone.
However, in a more recent study, in transgenic Ren2 rats
with increased AngII and hypertension, combination ther-
apy did not result in better improvement in markers of glo-
merular injury when compared with single treatment.11
Similarly, renin inhibition showed equally effective nephro-
protection as AT1 receptor antagonism does in mice with
chronic kidney disease, without the additional benefit of
combination therapy.12 The reasons for the observed differ-
ences among these studies are unclear so far.
Accumulation of excess lipids in non-adipose tissues,
including the kidney, may induce cellular dysfunction
and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of
diabetic kidney injury.13,14 Our previous studies have
demonstrated that dysregulated lipid metabolism includ-
ing increased fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and/or
reduced fatty acid oxidation and/or cholesterol efflux
contributes to lipid accumulation in the diabetic kid-
ney.15­21 Direct renin inhibition has been shown to
improve insulin resistance and adipose tissue dysfunction
in diabetic KK-Ay mice22 but whether RAAS inhibition
by aliskiren can improve abnormal lipid metabolism in
the diabetic kidney is not known.
The current work extends studies by comparing the
potential beneficial effects of aliskiren with or without val-
sartan in mice with DN. Here we demonstrate that aliskiren
has equal efficacy as valsartan in ameliorating diabetic kid-
ney diseases, by decreasing fibrosis, inflammation, endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lipid accumulation.
Combination with aliskiren and valsartan in some, but not
in all aspects, showed better nephroprotective effects in
diabetic kidneys compared with monotherapy.
Methods and materials
Animals and treatments
All procedures were in accordance with institutional guide-
lines for animal research. Eight week-old male DBA2/J
mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME, USA). They were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle. Mice were injected with freshly made STZ (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, 50 mmol/L sodium citrate
buffer pH 4.5) intraperitoneally (40 mg/kg) for 5 consecu-
tive days, or with 50 mmol/l sodium citrate solution only.
Tail vein blood glucose levels were measured 1 week after
the last STZ injection, and mice with non-fasting glucose
levels >250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. To replicate
the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia seen in subjects
with type 2 diabetes mellitus all mice were fed a high fat
diet (21% milk fat, 0.15% cholesterol, TD88137, Harlan-
Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) after the onset of diabetes.19
Animal studies and relative protocols were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Colorado, Denver, USA.
The mice were assigned to five treatment groups (n=6
each group). They were treated with vehicle (controls
(CTL) and diabetes (DM)), aliskiren (25 mg/kg per day,
D-Ali), valsartan (8 mg/kg per day, D-Val) and combina-
tion (D-AV). Aliskiren was subcutaneously infused to mice
viaALZETmicro-osmotic pump (DURECTCo., Cupertino,
CA, USA). Valsartan was given to mice in drinking water.
The drug treatments were carried out for 6 weeks. A 24-h
urine sample was collected from each mouse placed in indi-
vidual metabolic cages to measure urinary albumin and
nephrin excretion before sacrifice. Blood was taken from
the tail vein in mice for measurement of serum glucose con-
centration. After 6 weeks of drug treatment, all mice were
anesthetized with pentobarbital and the kidneys were rap-
idly excised from mice to perform biochemical and histo-
logical examinations, as described in following sections.
Valsartan and aliskiren were kindly provided by Novartis
(Basel, Switzerland).
Blood and urine chemistry
The serum concentration of glucose was measured by
LabAssay Glucose Kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Urinary
albumin, nephrin and creatinine concentrations were deter-
mined using kits from Exocell (Philadelphia, PA, USA).
Blood pressure measurement
Mean blood pressure (MAP) was measured in conscious
mice by tail-cuff sphygmomanometer (Visitech BP2000;
Apex, NC, USA). All animals were preconditioned for
blood pressure measurements for 1 week before each
experiment.
Histology
Sections (4-m thick) cut from 10% formalin-fixed, paraf-
fin-embedded kidney samples were stained with periodic
acid-Schiff (PAS). Thirty glomeruli were randomly selected
from each mouse to perform the PAS analysis. Semi-
quantitative scoring of glomerulosclerosis was performed
using a five-grade method described previously.19 Frozen
sections were stained with oil red O, to identify neutral
lipid deposits.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
We performed immunostaining for nephrin (mouse anti-
body, a gift from Dr. Larry Holzman, University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and synaptopodin
(Sigma) and imaged with a laser scanning confocal micro-
scope (Zeiss 510 NLO/META, Jena, Germany). The
386 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
expression level was quantified as the sum of pixel values
per glomerular area using ImageJ (version 1.44) image
analysis software.
RNA extraction and quantitative
real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the kidney cortex using SV
Total RNA Isolation System from Promega (Madison, WI,
USA) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse tran-
scriptase reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules,
CA, USA). The mRNA level was quantified using Bio-Rad
iCyCler real-time PCR machine. Cyclophilin RNA was
used as an internal control and the amount of RNA was
calculated by the comparative threshold cycle method as
recommended by the manufacturer.
Protein electrophoresis andWestern blotting
Equal amounts of protein samples from the kidney cortex
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitro-
cellulose membranes. After being blocked with 5% fat-free
milk powder in 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (20
mmol/l Tris·HCl and 150 mmol/l NaCl, pH 7.4), the blots
were incubated with antibodies against: 1) podocin (1:200;
G20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), 2)
WT1 (1:200; G20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 3) MAS
receptor (1:1000, Alomone Labs AAR-013, Jerusalem), 4)
CHOP (1:1000, Cell signaling #2895), XBP-1 (1:1000,
sc-7160). Corresponding secondary antibodies were visual-
ized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Bradford,
IL, USA). The signals were quantified with a chemilumi-
nescence detector and the accompanying densitometry
software (UVP, Upland, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the means ± SE. Data were ana-
lyzed by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test for mul-
tiple comparisons. Statistical significance was accepted at
the P < 0.05 level.
Results
Treatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren
and/or valsartan on metabolic parameters
As shown in Table 1, the body weights of diabetic mice
were significantly decreased compared to control mice,
whereas the ratio of kidney weight/body weight was sig-
nificantly increased in all groups of diabetic mice. Blood
glucose levels in all diabetic groups were significantly
higher than non-diabetic control mice. Aliskiren or valsar-
tan treatment had no effect on the blood glucose levels in
these mice. Therapy with aliskiren, valsartan and the com-
bination all significantly reduced blood pressure in diabetic
mice compared with non-treated diabetic mice.
Treatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren
and/or valsartan improved proteinuria and
prevented podocyte injury and loss as well
as mesangial expansion
As shown in Figure 1(a), diabetic mice treated with vehicle
developed moderate albuminuria. Monotherapy with
aliskiren and/or valsartan significantly and comparably
decreased urinary albumin excretion in diabetic mice.
Podocyte injury results in increased podocyte excretion
into the urine. We therefore measured urinary nephrin
excretion as a marker of podocytes in the urine. Although
both aliskiren and valsartan treatment alone significantly
reduced urinary nephrin excretion in diabetic mice, combi-
nation therapy provided greater reduction in urinary nephrin
excretion than single treatment, indicating synergistic
effects of aliskiren and valsartan on protection of podocyte
integrity in diabetes (Figure 1(b)). Consistent with reduced
urinary nephrin excretion, reduced immunostaining of
nephrin in glomeruli of diabetic mice was significantly pre-
vented by both monotherapy and combination treatment
(Figure 2(a) and 2(c)). Immunofluorescence microscopy
showed that both monotherapy and combination treatment
also prevented reduced expression of synaptopodin seen in
mice with diabetes (Figure 2(b) and 2(c)). Western blots
showed that podocin protein abundance was 40% decreased

in diabetic mice treated with vehicle, monotherapy with
aliskiren or valsartan and combination treatment reversed
decreased podocin expression to control level. Although
combination treatment was associated with higher expres-
sion of podocin when compared to monotherapy, this
increase did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3(a)
and 3(c)). Protein expression of WT1, a nuclear podocyte
marker, was also examined by Western blots (Figure 3(b)
and 3(c)). The abundance of WT1 was significantly reduced
to about 80% of control level in diabetic mice, whereas
monotherapy and combination treatment increased WT1
expression, suggesting podocyte loss seen in diabetic mice
may be prevented by the treatments.
In addition to podocyte injury, glomerular mesangial
expansion is also a hallmark of DN. PAS staining and semi-
quantitative scoring was used to assess mesangial expan-
sion. Compared with controls, diabetic mice with vehicle
treatment showed marked mesangial expansion and clearly
increased accumulation of extracellular matrix in the
mesangium (Figure 4). Mesangial expansion was reduced
by aliskiren or valsartan treatment alone, but combination
with aliskiren and valsartan had additional inhibitory
effects (Figure 4). Vehicle treated mice showed the highest
score, and all drug treatments led to a reduction in the
mesangial expansion, with combination treatment resulting
in additional reduction (Figure 4).
Treatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren
and/or valsartan modulated renal fibrosis
and inflammation
Renal fibrosis and inflammation are important mediators of
DN. To determine the effect of the treatments on profibrotic
factors, we measured the mRNA expression of transform-
ing growth factor- (TGF-), plasminogen activator inhibi-
tor-1 (PAI-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
in the kidney. As shown in Figure 5, in non-treated diabetic
mice gene expression of TGF-, PAI-1 and CTGF were all
increased compared with the non-diabetic control. The
increased mRNA level in these factors was significantly
suppressed by the treatments with monotherapy and combi-
nation therapy. Combination therapy with aliskiren and val-
sartan remarkably decreased mRNA expression of the
proinflammatory chemokines monocyte chemotactic pro-
tein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and inter-
leukin 1 (IL-1) (Figure 5).

Combination with aliskiren and valsartan
prevented renal lipid accumulation
Altered regulation of renal lipid metabolism has been
shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN.
Oil red O staining showed increased kidney neutral lipid
accumulation in both glomeruli and tubulointerstitium in
diabetic mice. The lipid accumulation was moderately
reduced after aliskiren and valsartan treatment (Figure
6(a)) and this was consistent with decreased mRNA
expression of adipophilin, a marker of lipid droplets
(Figure 6(b)) after combination treatment. We examined
the expression of genes that mediate cholesterol and fatty
acid/triglyceride synthesis. We found that there was a
2-fold increase in acyl-coenzyme A diacylglycerol acyl-
transferases (DGAT1) and a 12-fold increase in HMG CoA

(Figure 6(b)) protein expression in diabetes, which were
markedly inhibited by combination treatment with aliskiren
and valsartan, but not by single treatment. In contrast to
DGAT1, there were no changes in DGAT2 mRNA levels
(not shown) among the groups.
Effects of combination with aliskiren and
valsartan on ER stress
Diabetic kidney disease is associated with activation of ER
stress response; we therefore investigated protein expres-
sion of two important markers of ER stress response: CHOP
(C/EBP homologous protein) and XBP-1 (X-box binding
protein1). Western blots showed 1.5-fold increases of
CHOP and XBP-1 protein expression in diabetic mice,
which was completely suppressed by aliskiren, valsartan or
combination treatment at the same extent (Figure 7).
Effects of combination with aliskiren and
valsartan on the RAAS
As shown in Table 2, intrarenal renin mRNA was dramati-
cally induced in mice treated with aliskiren and/or valsartan,
due to disruption of the feedback loop, whereas (pro)renin
receptor expression was not significantly changed among
groups. We also examined the other components of the
RAAS. The renal expression of ACE and ACE2 mRNA were
significantly reduced in diabetic mice; combination treatment
was associated with recovery of their mRNA expression.
Interestingly, Mas receptor mRNA and protein abundance
was significantly decreased in diabetic mice and combination
treatment with aliskiren and valsartan dramatically reversed
Mas receptor mRNA and protein abundance to non-diabetic
control level (Table 2 and Figure 8). Single treatment with
aliskiren or valsartan had no effects on Mas expression.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that aliskiren treat-
ment significantly ameliorated kidney injury in diabetic
mice. Indeed, aliskiren was equally beneficial as valsartan
in protecting kidney injury in diabetes, including improve-
ment of functional and structural changes and inhibition of
fibrosis, inflammation, lipid accumulation and ER stress in
the kidney. Dual therapy with aliskiren and valsartan, in
some, but no in all aspects, produced additive and synergis-
tic therapeutic effects in the treatment of DN.

Aliskiren and valsartan equally reduced blood pressure,
albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in the diabetic animals.
Albuminuria is regarded as a major parameter of monitor-
ing the progression of DN and the pathogenesis of albumi-
nuria is mainly attributed to the alteration of glomerular
filtration barrier.19,23 The development of albuminuria in
the diabetic mice was associated with damage to podocyte
foot processes. There were decreases in podocyte abun-
dance and distribution, and in slit diaphragm protein
expression, which were manifested by reduced expression
of nephrin, synaptopodin, podocin and WT1 in diabetic
animals. Interestingly, monotherapy with aliskiren or vals-
artan restored distribution and staining intensity of nephrin
and synaptopodin and abundance of podocin and WT1 to a
similar extent, suggesting a protective effect on structure of
podocytes. Dual treatment with aliskiren and valsartan had
better therapeutic effects on restoration of nephrin (glomer-
ular slit diaphragm) and synaptopodin (actin cytoskeleton)
protein expression, although it had no greater effect on
albuminuria.
Although dual treatment was associated with a further
decrease of blood pressure when compared with either single
therapy group, animal studies in type II diabetic models (db/
db mice),9 STZ-induced diabetic rats5 and the AVOID clini-
cal study24­26 have demonstrated that the anti-proteinuric
effects of aliskiren with or without the AT1 receptor antago-
nist were independent of its blood pressure lowering effect,
suggesting antagonism to the intra-renal RAAS with aliskiren
or valsartan potentially playing an important role in kidney
protection. Functional expression of key components of the
RAAS has been demonstrated in differentiated human podo-
cytes27,28 and these podocytes are able to secrete AngII
locally. It is therefore likely that local RAAS blockade in the
kidney may prevent AngII-induced damage of podocytes in
diabetic conditions.
Renal damage in diabetes is associated with marked
increases in gene and protein expression of profibrotic and
proinflammatory factors. TGF1 stimulates extracellular
matrix production and is a key growth factor in diabetic
glomerulosclerosis.29,30 TGF1 is also a downstream target
of AngII31 and can be up-regulated by renin in mesangial
cells through the pro(renin) receptor independently of
AngII.32­34 Treatments with aliskiren or valsartan signifi-
cantly reduced the gene expression of TGF, CTGF and
PAI-1 therefore preventing kidney injury in diabetes. In
addition, at the doses used in this study aliskiren demon-
strated a better effect than valsartan in preventing increase
of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, MCP-1 and IL1-1
in the kidneys of the diabetic mice. A recent study per-
formed a dose-response curve of RAAS antagonism with

aliskiren and losartan, and showed much higher doses of
aliskiren (50 mg/kg/day) and losartan (167mg/kg/day) than
our studies, to yield equal RAAS inhibition.12 Due to such
a difference in dose response, we need to be cautious before
we can conclude if the two treatments have different effects
or additive effects on target pathways.
One of novel findings in the present study is the improve-
ment in renal lipid accumulation by aliskiren and/or valsar-
tan therapy. There is growing evidence for the role of
abnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of renal dis-
ease.15­17,19­21,35 Lipid metabolites can induce profibrotic
and proinflammatory cytokine production in the kidney
cells, increase generation of reactive oxygen species and
promote the expression of extracellular matrix.14,16,19,20,35­37
Oil red O staining showed neutral lipid accumulation (cho-
lesterol ester and triglycerides) in the diabetic kidney. The
increase in lipid staining was paralleled with increases in the
mRNA level of DGAT1 that catalyzes terminal and the only
committed step in triglyceride synthesis,38 and increased
mRNAexpression of HMG CoAsynthase that is involved in
cholesterol synthesis.39 Although aliskiren or valsartan pre-
vented an increase of these two gene expression, dual treat-
ment with aliskiren and valsartan indeed induced
improvement in the alterations of renal lipid accumulation
(oil red o staining) which is associated with reduced mRNA
levels in DGAT1 and HMG CoA synthase. It has been

known that AT1 receptor blockers can prevent atherosclero-
sis and decrease cholesterol and triglyceride levels, suggest-
ing an interaction between the RAAS and lipid
metabolism.40­42 Therefore blockade of the RAAS system
with both aliskiren and valsartan, at least in part, protects
renal function by preventing renal lipid accumulation.
The ER is the principal site for the folding and matura-
tion of secretary and transmembrane proteins and the main
site for the synthesis and uptake of lipids. Aberrant meta-
bolic conditions such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia
can affect ER trafficking, activate ER stress and corre-
sponding three signaling pathways that generally relieve
the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded ER proteins.
Recently, activation of ER stress response has been docu-
mented in diabetic animals and patients with progressive
DN (e.g. increased expression of CHOP and XBP-1).43­45
Although the role of a classical marker of ER stress C/EBP
homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor induces
apoptosis, in kidney injury is debatable,46 CHOP deficient
mice were resistant to ER stress-induced cell death and
DN,45 and consistent with this, expression of CHOP protein
was significantly increased in diabetic mice when com-
pared with controls. In the present study aliskiren with or
without valsartan reduced CHOP and XBP-1 protein
expression, thus may attenuate ER stress response and pre-
vent cells from injury and apoptosis in diabetic kidneys.
However, how intracellular RAAS blockade by aliskiren or
valsartan and how renin or AngII was involved in ER stress
in diabetic kidneys are still unknown. Interestingly, in con-
trast, tunicamycin induced-ER stress is associated with
increased activation of SREBP-2, a lipogenic transcription
factor, and increased do novo biosynthesis and accumula-
tion of lipid in the proximal tubules.47 Further studies are
therefore warranted to clarify the complex, mechanistic
link between ER stress and lipid accumulation in the
kidneys.
It is well known that angiotensin-converting-enzymes 2
(ACE2) converts AngII to Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-7) exerts
its effects on antagonizing AngII in the kidney through Mas
receptor.48,49 ACE2 gene deletion was recently found to
accentuate diabetes-related glomerular damage50 whereas
ACE2 gene overexpression was found to ameliorate glo-
merular injury in DN.51 Interestingly, Ang-(1-7) improved
lipid and glucose metabolism in transgenic rats with
increased circulating Ang-(1-7).52 In our studies single
treatment with aliskiren or valsartan did not prevent
decrease of Mas receptor expression in diabetic mice, but
dual treatment with aliskiren and valsartan significantly
increased expression of Mas receptor mRNA and protein in
diabetic mice, indicating that dual or a more complete
blockade of RAAS has an effect on activating the ACE2-
Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. Although more complete
blockade of the RAAS with renin inhibitor and ARBs have
shown beneficial effects in renal protection in diabetes, in
clinical practice, these were offset by a high risk of
hyperkalemia and hypotension,53 which may be caused by
suppression of aldosterone and alteration of renal hemody-
namics. Whether the lack of protective components of
RAAS cascade (such as ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor
axis) is involved in such a consequence during dual block-
ade is still unknown. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren sup-
presses production ofANG I (a substrate ofACE2) resulting
in a decrease of Ang-(1-7), as seen in an experimental
chronic allograft nephropathy.54 This showed better protec-
tive effects of candesartan than aliskiren, which was likely
to be due to lower generation of protective Ang-(1-7) in
response to aliskiren when compared with candesartan.
Increased protein expression of Mas in dual treatments may
be a feedback to complete blockade of RAAS, but it may
suggest a potentially beneficial approach by combination
with activation of Ang-(1-7) and inhibition of AngII in dia-
betic kidney diseases.
In conclusion, the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren pro-
vided a protective effect against renal damage in diabetic
mice through inhibition of the profibrotic processes, inflam-
mation and lipid accumulation, as well as prevention of the
activation of ER stress. Aliskiren showed equal therapeutic
efficacy when compared with valsartan, and thus the poten-
tial of aliskiren is at least comparable to that of valsartan in
renoprotection. For certain targets, dual blockade with
aliskiren and valsartan produced additive therapeutic
effects in preventing the activation of cellular processes
associated with the pathogenesis and progression of DN.
