Introduction
This article concerns a classic book in the sociology of devi-
ance, Stanley Cohen's (1973) Folk Devils and Moral Panics.
Although Google Scholar records almost 4,000 citations
since it was published, that does not reflect how popular the
concept has become. It has generated a half-dozen text
books, crossed over into popular culture, and will soon reach
1 million pages on a Google search (Thompson & Williams,
2012). Although the application of the label has been queried
in specific cases (Cornwell & Linders, 2002; Critcher,
2003), no one has ever subjected Cohen's case study to
critical scrutiny. However, the moment one compares
Cohen's (1969) model to the historical record, his own dis-
sertation on the subject, and even a close reading of Folk
Devils to his model, it quickly becomes apparent that the
public reaction to the clashes between the British Mods and
Rockers youth groups in 1964 did not support either Cohen's
description or definition of a moral panic. In short, the moral
panic literature and the concept's popularity are built on an
extremely weak foundation.
Descriptions and Definitions
If popularity were any guide, Stan Cohen's (1973) Folk
Devils and Moral Panics is Britain's major contribution to
sociology, and the story of the Mods and Rockers has mes-
merized criminology, media studies, a score or more of other
disciplines, and even the rock group "The Who." As a result,
it has become an international truism that a minor spat
between two groups of bored youths at a decaying U.K.
seaside resort was turned by a distorted and exaggerated
media account into an extremely irrational societal-wide
reaction--a moral panic--increasing the deviancy it con-
demned while ignoring the moral boundary crisis that pre-
cipitated the panic, even though it never happened.
For two decades, U.S. scholars ignored Cohen's ground
breaking theoretical account of how societies create the devi-
ancy that they condemn, reaffirm a consensus in values, and
build unnecessary control cultures, preferring their own
explanations, including moral enterprise (Becker, 1963),
symbolic crusades (Gusfield, 1963), and crime waves
(Fishman, 1978). However, the last decade has seen a para-
digm shift, and "moral panic" has become the explanation
without any debate over its viability, despite the growing
number of awkward questions raised by evidential critics,
rival paradigms, and even adherents aware that its weak-
nesses have became too obvious to ignore (Cornwell &
Linders, 2002; Furedi, 1997; Garland, 2008; McRobbie &
Thornton, 1995; Thompson, 1989, 1994; Waiton, 2008).
The major problem remains the very cause of its popular-
ity: the complete lack of theoretical, definitional, and eviden-
tial integrity evidenced by the way the label has been applied
to anything that appears to conform to Cohen's (1973)

Mods and Rockers, Drunken Debutants,
and Sozzled Students: Moral Panic or the
British Silly Season?
BillThompson1 and Cecil Greek2
Abstract
Over the last decade, moral panic theory has affected a paradigm shift in the social construction of deviance and social
problems in the United States,without any real debate about its viability.This article raises key questions about this perspective
by offering the first ever critique of the seminal case study of British youth subcultures on which the paradigm is based. It
argues that when analyzed in the context of contemporary criticism of vandalism,hooliganism,and delinquency,the Mods and
Rockers case study never justified Cohen's original criteria for a moral panic.

description of a moral panic rather than his definition, even
though the former is generic to every other model of social
problem construction:
· A social group or phenomena is defined as a threat
to societal values in the media.
· The coverage includes denunciations of the folk
devil/phenomenon by editors, religious leaders,
politicians, and "experts."
· "Ways of coping" are devised.
· The folk devil becomes embedded in the collective
memory.
· Legal/social policy changes may follow. (Cohen,
1973, p. 9)
As a result, with one notable exception (Hall, Critcher,
Jefferson, Clarke, & Robert, 1979), no one else has ever
uncovered a moral panic as Cohen (1973) defined them in
Folk Devils, which supposedly "contained all the elements
from which one might generalize about Folk Devils and
Moral Panics" (p. 11). The definition consisted of three
"distinct but interlocking" phases involving an interactive
process among the media messages, the general public, the
social control agencies, and the folk devils, none of which
appears or is implied in the description:
· Phase 1 involves the media coverage of the "pre-
cipitating event" that involves Exaggeration and
Distortion, Prediction about further difficulties to
come, and the Symbolization of the problem the
folk devil represented.
· Phase 2 concerns the way the media coverage leads
to the Orientation of public beliefs with the aid
of Images of the folk devil that lead to new stig-
matizing labels and a consensus over Causation
explaining their behavior, and revolves around the
subsequent Sensitization of the public and social
control agencies to the problem making the prob-
lem look bigger than it is.
· Phase 3 covers the simultaneous increase in the
Societal Control Culture, including new laws, and
the role of Exploitative Cultures using the panic for
their own ends.
These three phases also contained a vast array of "must
have" features from the public dramatization of evil to the
amplification of the deviancy that facilitates the nine "ele-
ments," but as they were also generic to other perspectives,
the defining feature of a moral panic was the "transactional
process" between the parties involved over the three phases
(Cohen, 1973, pp. 12-204).
Consequently, the popularity of the concept and the grow-
ing number of subsequent moral panics was a function of the
use of the generic description that ensured that the moment an
academic picked up a newspaper and saw a horror headline
followed by adverse moral comment and a politician demand-
ing legislation, another panic was added to the paradigm's
catalog, even though the general public who were supposed to
be panicking were none the wiser and could not have cared
less (Thompson, 1989).
Despite the attempt of the U.S. variant of panic theory to
circumvent these problems, it has only succeeded in making
matters worse (Goode & Ben-Yehuda, 1994). As any sudden
manifestation of a social group's fears about another group's
behavior, lifestyle, or political perspective would appear
volatile and involve a consensus of concern by "a segment of
society" expressing hostility through "disproportionate"
claims about the threat, the "new, improved" definition is
even more generic than Cohen's overworked description.
Moreover, as this new definition no longer contains the ratio-
nales and justifications for the label moral panic that Cohen's
definition supplied, the concept no longer makes any sense
(Thompson & Williams, 2012). Although this tendency was
fueling the concept's rising popularity in the United States
during the 1990s, back in Britain, conservative ideologues
were having a field day ridiculing the concept by demon-
strating the panic paradigm's failure to apply the label to pro-
gressive causes even though they frequently matched the
generic description as well (Hunt, 1997).
This article draws attention to three major, interrelated,
problems found in Cohen's account that have subsequently
shaped the paradigm and encouraged that political bias: (a)
the panic paradigm's reliance on theories about social action
rather than the actors'motivations; (b) the failure to establish
quality control, including the 40-year failure to subject any
of the seminal studies to evidential scrutiny testing their via-
bility; and (c) the tendency of case studies to deliberately
ignore countervailing evidence. We illustrate these problems
by drawing attention to how several omissions from the his-
torical record reveal that even Cohen's initial case study that
launched the model did not match his description, let alone
his definition of moral panic.
The Contextual Background
According to Cohen (1973), despite the fact that the clash
between the two youth groups at Clacton only made head-
lines because of a "slow news day" (p. 45), the coverage
quickly led to the projection of extensive unarticulated fears
about the "direction in which society was going" onto
the Mods and Rockers (Cohen, 1973, pp. 29-43, 49-65).
However, while the reports were exaggerated and distorted,
they would not have generated public "confusion" about the
meaning of the "ambiguous" event--the basis of the "panic"
in the moral panic--because the news media had been full
of stories about violent hooliganism and destructive vandal-
ism for three long years, and little else in the weeks leading
to Clacton.
Thompson and Greek 3
Soccer hooliganism had become so prevalent between
1959 and 1963 that the government had established atten-
dance centers to keep known hooligans away from the
games, and as Clacton involved two rival factions fighting
each other without concern for whom or what was in the
way, it raised a rational fear that mass hooliganism would
not end with the soccer season in May. Although home
grown soccer hooliganism was nothing new, rising affluence
had enabled groups such as the "Merseyside Maniacs" to
attend road games and fight with the home team's hooligans
(Dunning, Murphy, & Williams, 1988, pp. 141-181; Taylor,
1971, pp. 156-157).
Then, when a 3-year-old girl's drowning was blamed on
an anonymous vandal who had broken the safety catch on a
gate preventing unaccompanied children reaching the river
Irwell in 1960, vandalism rivaled soccer hooliganism for
media space and a popular indicator of delinquency, facts
charted by a contemporary doctoral student, named Stanley
Cohen (1969). By 1964, vandalism had become endemic as
public and privately owned facilities from advertising bill-
boards to schools came under attack. That nothing was
sacred was demonstrated by the 250% increase in claims
from vandalized churches between 1960 and 1964 (Cohen,
1969). This coverage was enhanced in the weeks leading up
to Clacton with a series of horror headlines about dangerous
and deadly vandalism, which would have ensured that
Clacton would have made the front page even on a fast news
day. A post office report highlighting the lack of access to
emergency services because 70,000 public telephones were
being vandalized every year was matched by another from
British Rail concerning the 70% increase in derailments
caused by vandalism over the previous 2 years. Consequently,
when the Local Government Information Office released
The Cost of Vandalism to Local Authorities, Cohen (1969)
told us that its "get tough" policy ensured that the local
media, pulpits, passing-out parades, and school prize-day
speeches became preoccupied with vandalism (Cohen, 1969,
pp. 131-138, 145-158, 161-166), and all that ensured that
Clacton was the wrong time for Mods and Rockers to play
vandals and hooligans in public.
The omission of this immediate context from Folk Devils is
matched by the complete lack of any indication that the coun-
try was already in the midst of a debate over the causes of and
solutions to delinquency, involving political parties, churches,
charities, and other interest groups. The debate, which had
preoccupied the country since the appearance of the Teddy
Boy gangs in the early 1950s, had already led to six major
inquiries and parliamentary reports between 1959 and 1963,
and produced the competing explanations and solutions that
Cohen erroneously claimed suddenly appeared after Clacton
(Thompson & Williams, 2012).As a result, the only thing new
about the Clacton coverage was putting a label, Mods and
Rockers, on the previously anonymous vandals.
Likewise, although a moral "boundary crisis" definitely
existed, Clacton could not have led to the "suppressed fears"
about the "permissive society" being projected on to the
youths--the "moral" in the moral panic (Cohen, 1973, pp.
193-194), because the country had already divided into two
camps over permissiveness during March 1963 following
three very public scandals. The month was best remembered
for the Profumo Affair that led to the resignation of the sec-
retary of state for war following the exposure of his adulter-
ous liaison with Ms. Keeler, who counted the Soviet naval
attaché Yevgeny Ivanov among her paying paramours during
a hot period of the cold war. Two other issues turned March
1963 into a Moralgate. The first was the acquittal on a man-
slaughter charge of a 16-year-old youth who had smashed a
wine decanter over the head of the former chairman of the
Labour Party, George Brinham, during an attempted moles-
tation. That revelation and the fact Profumo lied to parlia-
ment about his affair led the public to question whether any
politician maintained the same moral standards that they
demanded from the masses. On top of that, March also saw
the release of Honest to God, a critique of simplistic reli-
gious faith by the bishop of Woolwich, Dr. John Robertson.
Conservative Christians, already upset by his role in the
1960 Lady Chatterley trial that destroyed literary censorship
in the United Kingdom, were horrified that the virgin birth
and resurrection were being debunked in front of a rapidly
secularizing population, and even more so, with the bishop's
subsequent dismissal of the church's sexual morals on prime
time TV. As a result, the rationales for Britain's moral laws
disappeared overnight, not least because of the policy already
adopted by director general of the BBC, Hugh Greene.
Convinced that Britain was well on the way to becoming a
pluralistic society, Greene ensured that all sides gained a
hearing through the new medium of documentaries, lengthy
but riveting studio discussions, and the path breaking satiri-
cal show That Was The Week That Was. These innovations
ensured that the three scandals' ramifications were debated
in every home, unlike those of the 1920s and 1930s reprised
by Blythe in his Age of Illusion published at the same time
(Blythe, 1963; Greene, 1969; Howard, 1963; Whitehouse,
1971). The public reaction was far more dramatic than that
provoked in the United States by Edward R. Morrow's con-
temporaneous Columbia Broadcasting Service reports.
In the face of the subsequent maelstrom of mass malcon-
tent on all sides, The Times, Britain's "establishment" mouth-
piece led the media pack in flipping the existing discourse
regarding Britain's "social malaise" into a "moral malaise"
by reminding its readers,
History shows that societies rise and fall, flourish and
decay, by what they believe in and by what their way
of life stands for. (February 11, 1963, cited in Howard,
1963, p. 18)
Unfortunately for the establishment, they were the only
ones who were going to panic about this modern "fall
of Rome." Middle-class Oxbridge graduates had already
4 SAGE Open
demonstrated their preference for gainful satire at the BBC
rather than government service at the Foreign Office. The new
corporate white-collar classes wanted more "permissiveness"
too. They welcomed the deregulation of moral crimes that
began in the mid-1950s, lapped up the likes of Lady Chatterley,
lined up all nights in their thousands to buy the Denning
Report on the Profumo Affair, and watched with glee as the
champions of the "new morality"--as permissiveness was
called at the time--bested the hapless defenders of the old on
TV night after night. Meanwhile, the masses who preferred
socialism to patriotism and Empire were refusing to stand for
the national anthem when played at local cinemas screening
cynical "northern realist" movies, amplifying the effects of the
"kitchen sink" stage plays from "the angry young men" of the
1950s (Thompson & Williams, 2012). In such a climate, it
would have been impossible for anyone to make anyone or
anything, let alone the Mods and Rockers, the subject of a
societal-wide reaction against permissiveness.
Although Clacton initially excited the "law and order"
lobby, their involvement did not last long. The handful of
spats on a couple of beaches over the next 3 years simply
could not compete with the horror headlines about soccer
hooliganism's increasing casualty list and the rising body
count from the London gang-land feud between the Krays
and Richardson "firms," the serial child killing Moors
Murderers, and the shooting of three London policemen.
Those developments ensured not only that "violence"
replaced "youth" as the lobby's metaphor for adverse change
during this period (Chibnall, 1977, pp. 83-88, 93-94) but also
that switch was used by the second seminal moral panic case
study to explain the alleged panic over muggers (Hall et al.,
1978). As a result, long before the last deck chair was put
away in 1964, the only people left "panicking" about the
youths were a couple of resort town's traders associations,
whose demands for action were invariably opposed by the
police (Cohen, 1973, pp. 84, 118).
This missing contextual background has several ramifica-
tions for Cohen's account of the way the media "inventory"
covering Clacton was supposed to promote the moral panic.
The Inventory Explained
As vandalism and hooliganism were already receiving
"grossly disproportionate" coverage compared with other
crimes before Clacton (Cohen, 1969, pp. 139, 149), the col-
umn inches devoted to the Clacton reaction was not surpris-
ing. Most distortions recorded by Cohen followed on
directly from the preexisting media frames, and the all-
important "prediction" element with its supposed multiplier
effect is explained by the fact that the youths added insult to
injury by putting on a repeated performance the very next
day. As a result, apart from naming and blaming the youths
for the previously anonymous crime of vandalism, the media
inventory could not have had the "new" meanings and sub-
sequent effects Cohen (1973, pp. 31-39) accredited to them.
Likewise, far from representing a united philosophy as
Cohen claimed, the same misreported incidents displayed in
the press reports are explained by the fact that every article
initially relied on the same source, a "stringer": the local
newspaper reporter who supplied the newswire services with
a story they were willing to buy because of all the previous
publicity about violent vandals. As that also explains why
the initial reports concentrated on the "violence linked to
vandalism," "the cost of damage," and "loss of trade" rather
than the physical clash, it negates Cohen's (1973) ability to
assert that they offer proof of media irrationality (pp. 36-37).
There was not anything new, different, or special about the
news' editorials and bombastic comments about the youths
that then appeared, as they emanated from the marginalized
law and order lobby frustrated that they were loosing the
delinquency debate in general and had just failed to stop the
1963 Children's and Young Persons Act with its "soft
options" for juvenile delinquents. In any event, the lobby's
indignation had far less to do with the youths' disrespect for
authority than their own resentment that their "natural ally,"
the Conservative Party, then in government, was being just
as liberal as the Socialist Labour Party. That political con-
sensus also explains why, despite Cohen's (1973) claims
about the media "symbolism" (pp. 40-44, 115) having a
dramatic effect, the press was really scraping the barrel by
relying on an aging vicar, a youth worker, a probation offi-
cer, a marriage councilor, a psychiatrist, a headmaster, and a
"pop star" to populate the moral barricades. The failure of
any arch-bishops, cabinet ministers, shadow cabinet minis-
ters, professors with research to cite, leaders of national
associations dealing with youth, chairs of county govern-
ment associations, senior police officers, and the headmaster
and mistresses associations to appear in media discussions,
when they usually led societal condemnation of deviants,
was highly significant.
Reaction Phase 1: Manufacturing
Opinions and Attitudes
The second phase of the alleged moral panic involving the
inculcation of the media inventory that orientates the pub-
lic's understanding of the problem reinforcing the folk dev-
ils' role as a target for those unarticulated fears is also
questionable as the causation offered after Clacton, from
"boredom" to "potential cabalism," was the same as that
offered before Clacton for delinquency in general. Indeed,
according to a long forgotten article, as every one of the new
causes had also been thrown at the violent Teddy Boys 10
years before, their reappearance undermined Cohen's claim
they were related to his account of the context of the 1960s
(Rock & Cohen, 1970).
Media inventories would be needless anyway given the
public's personal experience of endemic vandalism and soc-
cer hooliganism that had already ensured that 84% believed
that these manifestations of delinquency were symbiotically
Thompson and Greek 5
linked (Cohen, 1969). The public could not have adopted the
alleged "disaster orientation" of the media either, given that
it did not appear in the contemporaneous press, but was a
function of Cohen's (1973, pp. 22-26) analytical framework.
The only adverse disaster analogy that appeared at the time
was a single reference made by one Brighton MP comparing
the beachside invasion by the youths with the aftereffects of
an earthquake, although the police were mindful of another
analogy. They were determined to nip any potential trouble
in the bud because of the recent "disaster" in Lima, Peru,
when 200 soccer fans were crushed to death as the crowd
attempted to escape from rioting hooligans and the police's
use of tear gas. As 10,000 youths swarming over the 20-foot-
elevated promenade at Brighton was a serious safety threat,
far from being heavy handed, the police believed that they
were saving the youths from themselves (Cohen, 1973, pp.
51-52; see Hansard, House of Commons [HOC], June 23,
1964, pp. 274-277).
As we do not have the space to cover all the rationales
Cohen offered for the successful inculcation of the media
"images" despite the lack of any direct evidence (see the
polemic rebuttal in Thompson & Williams, 2012), we draw
your attention to three key problems. Less than a year after
Folk Devils, Cohen admitted that although media accounts
could set an agenda, no one could determine what conclu-
sions the public would adopt (Cohen & Young, 1973, Part 3,
Introduction). Cohen's account relies on examples of pseudo-
psychological explanations like mass hysteria and mass
delusion found elsewhere around the world, which he sug-
gested were at work in the United Kingdom also whenever
he was unable to offer direct evidence. This was a doubly
dubious practice given that whenever sociologists have
examined these "explanations," from The War of the Worlds
radio panic of the 1930s to the satanic panic of the 1980s,
they have always uncovered material explanations for what
occurred (Lowery & DeFleur, 1983; Victor, 1993). Last but
not least, far from panicking, the public responded to the
horror headlines by pouring into Clacton the very next day
despite the weather being the worst for 80 years. They con-
tinued to flood over the battle ground beaches all summer
long in spite of all the predictions and "warnings" in the for-
lorn hope of catching the youths in action. Indeed, the
rematch in Margate over the Whitsun holiday 7 weeks later
dramatically increased hotel bookings despite the violence
(Cohen, 1973, p. 31). However, the overdramatic reporting
of "no shows" and "nonevents" by the newspapers in their
desperate attempt to maintain interest in a flagging story
ensured that it was not long before the disappointed public
realized that the problem had been blown out of all propor-
tion and was a storm in a tea cup. Beachside invasions were
rare and concentrated in three resorts, Brighton in particular
(Cohen, 1973).
Despite using a professional news clipping service, Cohen
(1973) could not offer any evidence of similar disturbances at
any of the other 50 resort towns from Bognor Regis in the
south to Whitby Bay in the north, although a couple of resorts
used the publicity as an excuse to ban bongo bashing beatniks
from their beaches. If anyone is exaggerating, it is Cohen. The
minor rumbles at Brighton, Bournemouth, Great Yarmouth,
Hastings, and Margate during Whitsun 1964 and the handful
of Mod invasions of Brighton in the summer of 1965 meant
that the Mods and Rocker phenomenon lasted a single sum-
mer, unlike the Teddy Boys who had caused general disorder
in most U.K. cities and towns all year round as well as beach
resorts during the summer season throughout the 1950s, as
Cohen knew perfectly well (Rock & Cohen, 1970).
This major evidential shortfall is not solved by Cohen's
examples of the media attempt to "widen the net," slapping
the label Mod on unrelated incidents inland as there is no
evidence that these alleged "follow-up stories" surpassed the
usual number of reports covering "Friday night fighting" in
the action-starved local press. As only one of Cohen's (1973)
examples alluded to "Mods" (pp. 79-80), and few people
would have read them, these stories could not have amplified
the panic nationwide. Indeed, as the police warnings only
concerned the 3-day weekends known as bank holidays dur-
ing the short U.K. summer season, and media attention dis-
appeared the moment the 9-month soccer season started
again, we are definitely dealing with a seasonal news theme.
Between September 1964 andAugust 1967, the 1,500 reports
sent to Cohen covering "vandalism/hooliganism" greatly
outnumbered those referencing "Mods/Rockers." Likewise,
the number of drunken students charged with public disorder
on the four Guy Fawkes Nights between 1964 and 1967
appears to have surpassed the total number of Mods and
Rockers arrested at the beach resorts during the same period,
making drunken students a greater threat. As Glasgow,
Birmingham, and a dozen other major cities also initiated
major antivandalism drives during 1965, this suggests that
vandalism per se remained a far more important issue than
the Mods and Rockers ever became (Cohen, 1969).
Another major omission, and perhaps the most important,
ensures that although a sudden event "perceived as a disloca-
tion of the social structure or a threat to cherished values"
may lead to "debates about the implications rather than the
event," the Clacton reaction was nothing like Cohen's (1973,
pp. 49-54) theoretically determined one. Far from demon-
strating that the Mods and Rockers became the perceived
threat to the "careworn cherished values," Folk Devils
merely offers up that supposition that the reaction followed
from the "possibility" that Britain's adults "might" have per-
ceived the Mods'a sexual fashion, mobility, deportment, and
posture of indifference "as something deeper and more per-
manent . . . the permissive society" (Cohen, 1973, p. 193).
That possibility is belied not only by the ongoing debates
over delinquency we covered above but also, more impor-
tantly, by the actions of the very people Cohen identified,
correctly, as being most likely to be adversely effected: the
evangelical Christian community personified by Mary
Whitehouse and Lord Longford.
6 SAGE Open
The response of the evangelicals and the old petit-bour-
geoisie they supposedly represented was the complete oppo-
sitetotheimpressionthatCohengavehisreaders.Whitehouse
initiated her counter attack against permissiveness immedi-
ately after the March 1963 Moralgate for precisely the rea-
sons we outlined above, which is why her Clean UP TV
(CUTV) campaign launched in May 1964 targeted Greene's
propagation of the "new morality" at the BBC, gaining far
more media coverage than the Mods and Rockers in the pro-
cess (Whitehouse, 1971, p. 45, 51). Between then and May
1965, when the CUTV metamorphosed into the National
Viewers and Listeners Association (NVALA), a permanent
moral crusade against all forms of permissiveness in the
media, Whitehouse still did not target the youths. As
Whitehouse had become the symbol and voice of the antiper-
missive forces during this period, that deals a severe blow to
Cohen's thesis (Greene, 1969;Whitehouse, 1977;Thompson,
1994). Cohen's (1973) erroneous inference that the evangeli-
cals shared the same perspective as his single law and order
informant "Blake" (pp. 126-132), on which his explanation
for the panic relied, is also belied by another major omission
from his account. Whitehouse's view of the youths was
shaped by the U.K.'s independent chapter of Moral
Rearmament that had launched a series of propaganda cam-
paign posters via the Daily Express, explaining and expound-
ing on what we would now call the "third way," the Christian
position between capitalism and socialism, every couple of
months. The one issued after Whitsun denounced the horror
headlines, defended the Mods and Rockers, and even excused
teenage drug taking and violence by placing the blame for
delinquency on the "hypocritical" elite from priests to parlia-
mentarians who had overseen Britain's moral decline during
the last decade (Daily Express, May 14, 1964). As we have
explained elsewhere, the motivating force behind that initia-
tive and the NVALA was their fear that the decriminalization
and normalization of sin, from birth control for unwed
women to smut sold in main street stores, would encourage
God's collective wrath on society (Greek & Thompson,
1992; Thompson, 1994). Longford, was a Christian-socialist
MP and far from the "reactionary" of Cohen's caricature. He
had chaired the Labour Party Education Committee that cod-
ified and promoted the most widely accepted explanation for
delinquency during the 1960s, "the school leaver problem,"
which Cohen presented in Folk Devils as if it was his own
and insisted had not been raised at the time (compare
Cohen's, 1973, pp. 181-182, account with Hansard, HOC,
June 23, 1964, pp. 239-240, 265-271).
Although it is always difficult to determine what "the
public" is thinking, the third omission in this phase concerns
the underreporting of the extent of "the differential reac-
tion." Cohen dismissed the results of his own contemporary
surveys as being "unrepresentative" of the wider public even
though the sample of professionals in the control culture and
another including residents of and visitors to Brighton would
provide an excellent test for the inculcation of the media
inventory, which is why Cohen (1969, Part 3, p. 632) picked
them. Contrary to the impression offered in Folk Devils, both
samples rejected the media orientation; They did so in favor
of their existing perspective, the meaning of which rarely
matched the theoretical spin Cohen placed on them.
For example, when the professional sample referenced
the generation gap that Cohen insisted was based on sexual
and material jealousy of the younger generation to fit his
explanation for the panic, the respondents offered competing
rationales including the gulf in religious and moral sensibili-
ties between the generations. The self-validating interpreta-
tions promoted by Cohen (1969, see Chapter 8) were only
belied by other more comprehensive surveys (Cohen, 1969,
p. 329; Musgrove, 1974, pp. 1-8); they help explain the core
problem with the account offered in Folk Devils. Although
the professional sample wanted the courts to "tighten up,"
that perspective was premised on reserving the courts for the
depraved hard-core hooligan. They preferred to deal with the
majority of deprived delinquents by retaining the informal
controls of the past, like a clip round the ear by a British
Bobby or the use of the cane in schools. Although Cohen
(1969) denounced that as a "reactionary" (pp. 348-356) solu-
tion in his PhD, the professionals preferred those controls
precisely because they wanted to avoid labeling and crimi-
nalizing troubled youth. In direct contradistinction to
Cohen's (1969) expectation, the magistrates in the sample
also rejected popular stereotypes and the "law and order" (p.
386) lobby's solution, preferring to judge each delinquent on
the basis of their individual character, behavior, motives, and
potential for recidivism. The wider sample, who blamed
delinquency on materialism and other social factors, also
wanted to reform the courts by reducing the gross overrepre-
sentation of conservative Christian women on the magis-
trates' bench in favor of the working classes, schoolteachers,
and youth workers who would understand the youths' prob-
lems (Cohen, 1969). Cohen's admission that he could not
make sense of these positions reflects the fact that he made
no attempt to study the philosophy behind them, because he
simply divided the world into progressives and reactionaries.
As a result, he never understood that far from being "incon-
sistent," the Christians in the professional sample rejected
the vengeful nature of the "law and order" lobby and were
wary of the psychological determinism being promoted by
contemporary progressives because they feared that it would
led to the insidious forms of social control that Cohen (1985,
1969, p. 389) later lamented had occurred when it was far too
late.
The Brighton public was equally dismissive of the media
inventory, for although 33.9% believed that the youths were
delinquent, 65.1% did not, and even those who did thought
that the youths were no worse than any other (Cohen, 1969).
The most important revelation, however, appeared in the
professional sample's answers to a "scale of contemporary
youth problems" in which they dismissed the Mods and
Rockers as less of a threat to public safety than joy riders.
Thompson and Greek 7
When asked to rank juvenile crimes, Mods and Rockers
came in 9th out of 14 options. The professionals'priorities--
(a) armed robbery, (b) vandalism on railway lines, (c) armed
gang fights, and (d) taking drugs--demonstrated not only
that they, like the masses, judged threats by the risk to life or
limb but also that they were still being guided by the pre-
Clacton vandalism inventory and their memory of the previ-
ous decade's highly publicized Teddy Boy knife fights
(Cohen, 1969, Table 35). Readers need only examine the
contemporary Pathe newsreels covering the Mods and
Rockers, available now on YouTube (2010), to see why they
did so. Despite the commentary invariably playing up the
"threat" to justify its subject matter, the content demon-
strated that this was no more than "a storm in a tea cup" and
helps explain why this kind of media exaggeration and the
Keystone Cop behavior fanned the flames of the widespread
cynicism toward needless authority mercilessly lampooned
by the Monty Python team who had also written for That Was
The Week That Was.
These distortions in Folk Devils are surpassed by the
bemusing oversight concerning the prehistory of the Rockers
that explains what Cohen never did: why the youths clashed
at Clacton. If the omission of the pre-Clacton inventory was
odd, the possibility that the founder of the moral panic para-
digm was unaware that the Rockers had already been sub-
jected to two generic description panics before 1964 defies
credulity. The first wave of adverse publicity labeled them
Ton-up boys reflecting their obsession reaching "the ton,"
100 mph, on the U.K.'s congested pre freeway roads in the
late 1950s. They then metamorphosed into "Rockers" during
the early 1960s at the Ace Cafe on London's North Circular
Road, which they turned into their personal race track. These
events attracted the attention of the "exploitative culture," in
the form of Freeman's 1961 popular novel Leather Boys,
which was turned into a 1963 exploitation movie featuring
the Ace as a location. By then, however, the Rockers were
facing competition on the roads from an armada of mobile
Mods on their imported Italian motor scooters that they also
used to invade the south coast resorts favored by the Rockers,
making clashes inevitable and frequent during 1963.
Although the press did not catch on to that development, the
public definitely had evidenced by the way Britain's unoffi-
cial barometer of popular trends, Stock Exchange messen-
gers, had adopted the rival monikers "Mod" or "Rocker" a
year before Clacton (Petrolheads, July 26, 2004; Cohen,
1969, p. 591). As a result, the public would have had no
problem differentiating between these members of highly
organized motor cycle clubs, complete with membership
cards, from the Mods before Clacton.
Collectively, these omissions from Cohen's account of
the Clacton reaction is the equivalent of "explaining" U.S.
foreign policy from Reagan onward without once mention-
ing Rumsfeld, Cheney, or the role of the neo cons and their
new mission for America. In reality, the U.K. public were no
where near as united in condemnation as Cohen contends,
and it would have been impossible to turn the youths into
societal-wide scapegoats for permissiveness when most peo-
ple didn't care. Those mobilizing against permissiveness had
defended the youths, and the politically marginalized law
and order lobby were more interested in counting dead bod-
ies, rather than damaged scooters.
Reaction, Phase 2: EvidenceVersus
"Analysis"
As it is impossible to cover them all, we offer a representa-
tive sample of our reservations about Cohen's (1973, p. 78;
see Thompson & Williams, 2012) account of the public and
police sensitization to "any act that looked like hooliganism"
that was then "invariably classified as part of the Mods and
Rockers phenomenon." Soccer hooliganism continued to be
considered a separate phenomenon despite consisting of the
"hard-Mods," who quickly metamorphosed into the U.K.'s
notorious skinheads, fighting each other. Cohen's (1973)
best example of the supposed rise in false alarms reflecting
the sensitization process was immediately dismissed by the
police as "people getting jumpy after the trouble on the
coast" (p. 79). Cohen's (1973) examples of "police panic"
(pp. 79-80, 170), such as patrolling the Woking fun fair fol-
lowing a rumor of an impending invasion, are deliberately
misleading, in this case because fun fairs were frequent sites
of teen conflict. The "new" police tactics, supposedly
adopted as a result of the panic were not new either, having
been deployed against both the major political protest of the
era, the "ban the bomb" marches, and mobile soccer hooli-
gans (Driver, 1964; Dunning et al., 1988, p. 43). Likewise,
the alleged "unprecedented national coordination" of the
police response was nothing of the kind, as the all-important
conference at the Home Office only included the chief con-
stables from the five counties containing the invaded resort
towns (Cohen, 1973, pp. 86, 148; Cohen, 1969, p. 550).
Although the "dramatization of evil" in the courts was
true enough, it did not demonstrate an escalation in the con-
trol culture.As only 24 of the 97 Clacton arrestees were actu-
ally charged, and the criterion used to prosecute--a prior
conviction--guaranteed a "harsher" penalty, the "increase"
in penalties handed down after the Whitsun rematches were
in line with the "seriousness of the offence," and there was
nothing new about the deployment of the extralegal mea-
sures "making an example" of those who persisted in invad-
ing Brighton (Cohen, 1973, pp. 95-108); the courts'response
does not support Cohen's claims at all, and his PhD thesis
told a very different story about Brighton.
The claims about wrongful arrests were inflated by the
typical yobbo's lying lament that they "were doing nothing."
If they had bothered to educate themselves about the law and
appealed the "no bail" conditions imposed, they would have
gained instant release. Any police officer found to have been
overreacting was reprimanded, and there was no repetition
of the extralegal punishments once The Times denounced the
8 SAGE Open
whole affair (Cohen, 1969). Indeed, it was the lack of any
"crack down" that ensured the resort towns' "law and order"
lobbies were unimpressed despite all the rhetoric and contin-
ued to demand "more controls" over the 3-year period, evi-
denced by the type of complaint emanating from one License
Victuallers Association (Cohen, 1973, p. 118). The only real
"innovation" during this period was the airlift of police rein-
forcements to Hastings, although that too turned out to be a
dud (Cohen, 1973, p. 86; Cohen, 1969, p. 486). Despite the
dramatic voice over commentary you can see on YouTube, it
was merely a means to get a back-up squad over the con-
gested Bank Holiday roads, and as it failed in its primary
intent, to reduce the rising overtime costs of keeping reserves
on standby in each resort town, it was abandoned (see Cohen,
1969).
Once one notices that the survey in Folk Devils supposed
to demonstrate that 81% of the public were demanding
harsher penalties collapses to 18% the moment one removes
inflation factors, such as limiting media coverage to reduce
copycat behavior (Cohen, 1973; see Thompson & Williams,
2012), the only issue left to deal with is Cohen's account of
the in situ amplification of deviancy on Brighton beach.
Intended to offer the "more sociological explanation" that
negated the vicarious motives behind the public's presence
on the beaches, prove that the "differential reaction" was
unrepresentative and illustrate how the youths' enmity
toward each other was generated by the panic; it collapses
under the weight of the contradictions within it.
Before one even gets to the beach, the polarization by
panic thesis is belied by the very horror headlines that sup-
posedly provoked the panic. The labels Mod and Rocker
could hardly have had the pejorative meanings accredited to
them after Clacton by Cohen when resort town newspapers
such as Brighton Evening Argus and the national bestseller,
the Daily Mirror, were still not using the monikers Mod or
Rockers in their Whitsun horror headlines 7 weeks later
(Cohen, 1973, Daily Mirror, May 18, 1964). As anyone who
read Folk Devils would discover, the contemporaneous con-
demnation in the reports tended to consist of derogatory gen-
eralizations like The Daily Telegraph's attack on the "grubby
hoards of louts and sluts" (Cohen, 1973, pp. 34-35, 55, 166).
That lack of evidence for the immediate demonization of the
Mods and Rockers, like many others, followed from the fact
that Cohen's thesis relied on his own composite of the media
reports rather than a quantified content analysis, which
would have undermined it. Second, Cohen's assertion that
the youths were not really polarized before the Clacton
inventory rests on three contentious foundations. The first is
that as both groups were "working class," the polarization
was innately exaggerated, even though that had never
stopped rival youth groups from that class fighting over turf
or loyalty to soccer teams. Second, Cohen set an impossible
standard for polarization that never appeared in the press, the
need for the youths to constitute two "highly structured
opposing groups." What ultimately undermines Cohen's
polarization by panic thesis, however, is his reliance on the
lack of the homogeneity among the Mods when it came to
fashion, for if the Mods' lack of common fashion prevented
the homogeneity required for polarization, that also ensures
that the panic's alleged effect never materialized either. As
the different Mod subgroups' fashion sense in 1964 under-
mined the media claim that they constituted a distinct group,
the youths still only amounted to undifferentiated "crowds"
in 1965, and the beach invaders denied being Mods in 1966,
the polarization never appears in Folk Devils (1973, p. 187,
149, 200). What makes that contradiction all the more
remarkable is that the moment one turns to Cohen's (1973, p.
194) explanation for the panic, his "major factor" in the
Mods ability to become the public scapegoats for permis-
siveness was their "sheer uniformity in dress."
Likewise, Cohen wants us to believe that the Mods, who
were apparently "bored" and "listless" with "no definite
plans" once they arrived, were then led into deviancy by the
media publicity that created the "expectation" that there
would be trouble (Cohen, 1973, pp. 150-151), as if these
"excitement seekers" needed to be told by the Daily Mirror
that "delinquents throw deck chairs in the sea" or required
the encouragement of the Daily Express to "knock old ladies
over" while doing so. Yet the moment we turn to Cohen's
(1973) account of the context, we find that the Mods had
deliberately taken their "own form of excitement" (pp. 161,
164-165, 182), violence, generated to relieve their uncaring
capitalist cityscapes to the beaches with them. That admis-
sion makes far more sense given that these thugs' "target
could rapidly change from rockers, to beatniks, to police,"
and failing that led to "fighting amongst themselves" (Cohen,
1973, p. 152, 157). The ultimate reason for rejecting the
claim that none of this violence would have happened with-
out the Clacton reaction, of course, is that the Mods had
exhibited "their own form of excitement" at Clacton, not
once but twice before the media inventory could have had
any effect.
As the Rockers, as a group, were rarely in evidence after
Whitsun 1964, and you do not turn a Beatnik into a Mod or a
Rocker by telling him to "hit the road, Jack," it is no wonder
that Cohen's account does not match Young's definition of
the deviancy amplification process found in his description
of the police crack down on the dope smokers of Notting
Hill, London (Cohen, 1973, pp. 105, 111; Young, 1971). In
contrast to Young's cops and dope smokers' escalating reac-
tions to each others' behavior that lead to the creation of an
extensive counter culture with a "critical political response"
as well as an increase in the original deviance, turning the
cops' initial stereotype into reality, all Cohen (1973) can
offer is unconnected reports of "Friday-night fighting"
inland, the police picking on the wrong targets like beatniks,
"no shows," the standard level of sentencing in the courts,
and the arrest of innocents who won appeals at Brighton (pp.
79, 84, 96-98, 80-81, 103). As none of that amplified the
original deviance, beach fighting did not become part of the
Thompson and Greek 9
youth groups' lifestyles, and counter cultures or political cri-
tiques with lasting effects did not appear, we are forced to
agree with a contemporary doctoral student who declared
that the concept of deviancy amplification "would be inap-
propriate" to apply to the Mods and Rockers (Cohen, 1969,
p. 437). The same can be said of panic and parliament.
Today in Parliament
The major discrepancy between Cohen's account and social
reality concerns the Malicious Damage Act introduced after
the Whitsun clashes that increased the penalties for vandal-
ism.According to Cohen, this "emergency measure" directed
at the Mods and Rockers followed from the steady crystal-
lization of the media inventory in the parliamentary
responses. Although Taylor's resolution (April 15) and
Gurden's motion (April 27) were too early for the media
"symbolism" to do its work, the panic forced the home sec-
retary to abandon his position that the law was adequate, and
a statement to that effect (June 4) led to the Malicious
Damage Bill (June 23; Cohen, 1973, pp. 133-134). However,
as this explanation on which the panic paradigm was
founded and has remained uncontested for 40 years is
directly contradicted by the parliamentary record, it demon-
strates that the panic paradigm is based on a myth that could
and should have been exposed long before now.
Far from Taylor's resolution and Gurdon's motion not
reflecting the panic because of a lack of time, they both
undermine it. Although the former demanded that the gov-
ernment take action to address the problem at Clacton, Taylor
defined the problem as merely the latest example of delin-
quency, and the speeches during the latter denounced the
media coverage and asserted that the Mods and Rockers
were not even delinquent (Cohen, 1973; Hansard, HOC,
April 27, 1964). The tone was set by Gurden himself despite
being a reactionary. Having referenced the numerous com-
mittees and inquiries that constituted the national delin-
quency debate, including the government's Delinquent
Generations, Gurden savaged the media inventory and pro-
moted a "third way" solution: enforced compensation for
any damage done (Hansard, HOC, April 27, 1964, pp.
31-40). Most of the MPs, however, were more interested in
promoting their pet theories about the causes of delinquency
that they had just learnt was about to become the subject of a
Royal Commission. MPs Edelman, Snow, Fell (from the
resort town Yarmouth), and Thomas who followed Gurden
haggled over whether to blame U.S. TV shows and movies,
hypocritical adults, the youths' lack of religious sensibility,
or the "anomie of affluence"--a liberal Christian argument
long before Simon and Gagnon turned it into a sociological
one (Hansard, HOC, April 27, 1964, pp. 43-45, 48, 55-56,
63-64, 72-73; Simon & Gagnon, 1976). Snow and Bence tar-
geted capitalist materialism, whereas Thompson, being a
conservative, opted for parents'spending more time in bingo
halls and bowling alleys than raising their children (Hansard,
HOC, April 27, 1964).
For our purposes, the most important contribution was
from the opposition spokeswoman, Miss Bacon. Having
pointed out that the problem at Clacton could be accredited
to a small hard core, she launched into a discourse on the
classless nature of delinquency. Although Cohen had jumped
on that contemporary motif as evidence of the widespread
irrational misconception that the Mods and Rockers delin-
quency was caused by the youth's affluence, he misled his
readers regarding its origins and effect. The belief that delin-
quency was "classless" was a political critique of the law and
order lobby, evidenced by Bacon's argument that as there
was no difference between the worst beachside behavior and
that frequently exhibited by drunken upper-class debutants
or sozzled students from the middle classes, singling out
working-class youth was unacceptable in a modern society.
As Bacon also reiterated the findings of the Longford
Committee concerning the need to offer more help for work-
ing-class teens during their transition from school to work
because of recent structural dislocation (Hansard, HOC,
April 27, 1964), she dealt Cohen's thesis a double blow.
Mr. Brookes agreed and argued that Clacton was merely a
manifestation of the wider problem of hooliganism, and the
media coverage was completely false (listing several reasons
that Cohen would later use); that was why no new law was
needed, and he would continue to try and reduce the number
of teens going to jail. He then took the opportunity to
announce that his preferred means was to get his advisory
committee on delinquency to canvass the teen perspective on
"the stresses and strains caused by the changing British soci-
ety" to find a solution for delinquency (Hansard, HOC, April
27, 1964, pp. 80-87).
The constant references to the wider delinquency debate,
the common criticism of the horror headlines, and the rea-
sons given for rejecting the law and order lobby's demands
in the press clearly undermine Cohen's excuse about timing.
The speeches reveal that the MPs not only rejected the horror
headlines but also had a very different agenda. Having
already debated the wider issue of delinquency for 4 years,
they were raising the issues that they hoped would be
addressed by the Royal Commission, which were, as they are
now, a major device for justifying new directions in legisla-
tion, and the debate clearly inferred that its findings would
be liberal in keeping with the times.
Cohen's assertion that the Malicious Damages Bill that
followed targeted the youths, and reflected a change of heart
because of the moral panic, rests on four arguments. The first
is that Brooke informed the House during the debate,
I want this Bill also to be a reassurance to the long
suffering public. (Cohen, 1973, p. 137, emphasis
added)
The second concerned the increased number of MPs
addressing the beachside disturbances, and the Mods and
Rockers in particular. The third is his data-less assertion that
legislatures adopt tangential measures against folk devils
10 SAGE Open
because they prefer "affirmations and gestures" that "aligns
oneself symbolically with the angels" without taking up
"cudgels against the devil" because "at times of moral panic,
politicians in office . . . often act to calm things down"
(Cohen, 1973, pp. 136-138). The fourth is that as parliament
knew that the amount of damage was slight, "whatever the
`devil'was in the seaside resorts, it was not primarily vandal-
ism" (Cohen, 1973, p. 138). The first is misleading and the
other three offer perfect examples of the academic construc-
tion of reality.
Despite the publicity surrounding the Whitsun rematch,
as only 9 of the country's 650 MPs tabled parliamentary
questions that tend to reflect comment and complaint coming
from their constituents, that number proves that there was no
societal-wide panic. However, although the government
rejected the proposals contained within the questions because
it believed the present law was adequate, the question from
Taylor forced the home secretary to take the unusual step of
making the Seaside Resorts (Hooliganism) Statement,
although not for the reasons that Cohen claimed.
The eagle-eyed Taylor had noticed that the penalty
updates covering the inflation of the last 50 years in the pre-
Clacton Criminal Justice Act had overlooked Section 14 of
the 1914 Criminal Justice Administration Act (Hansard,
HOC, June 4, 1964). That meant that magistrates were still
restricted to the £20 compensation limit set in 1914, under-
mining the parliamentary preference for solution by restitu-
tion and justifying the resort towns' indignation that the law
was not tough enough. Being unaware of the oversight when
he declared that the existing law was adequate, Brooke apol-
ogized for that drafting error and announced that he would
raise the penalty and compensation level for acts of vandal-
ism to £100 each, matching the other previous updates.
However, by also taking the opportunity to repeat his vehe-
ment opposition to further legislation, the home secretary
also demonstrated that he never changed his mind (Hansard,
HOC, June 4, 1964).
As the parliamentary record proves that the Malicious
Damage Bill was merely an amendment correcting a drafting
oversight in a pre-Clacton act, and had nothing to do with
Cohen's convoluted reasoning about emergency measures,
"aligning with angels," or attempts to "calm things down", it
demonstrates how far Cohen's analysis of the whole affair is
divorced from reality, and as the real reason for the act
appears in his PhD, it raises awkward questions about all
those other omissions.
Far from embracing the media inventory, as every MP
agreed that the oversight had to be resolved, there was no
"debate" over the Malicious Damage Bill at all. Instead, they
used the opportunity to bury the media inventory and dismiss
the law and order agenda by drawing a clear distinction
between the Mods and Rockers and real delinquents. As far
as Brooke was concerned, the youths' only crime was to
have allowed their high spirits to provide cover for a few
hard-core hooligans, and that "reassure" comment that
Cohen exploited concerned reassuring anyone worried about
invasions that the law was adequate as he had claimed it was
because the oversight was being addressed (Hansard, HOC,
June 23, 1964, pp. 239-242). Miss Bacon readily agreed, and
attacked the "law and order" lobby. The first backbench MP
to speak, Morrison, despite having reservations about her
account of the difference between delinquents and criminals
suggested those complaining about the teens should engage
in voluntary service to help solve the school leaver problem
(Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 250-253). Fitch believed
that the amendment would help stop vandalism in parks and
on the railways, and the charter trains soccer hooligans took
to road games, as well as the beach side (Hansard, HOC,
June 23, 1964). Teeling from Brighton was still in favor of
labor camps, a demand favored by his town's "law and
order" lobby, but now sought to justify it as the best means of
ensuring that compensation was paid and castigated the
media too (Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 256-263). Reg
Prentice having condemned the "pompous editorials" over
Whitsun then offered the explanation for deviancy that
Cohen passed off as his own in Folk Devils: Some of those
labeled failures in an increasing meritocratic society took
their frustration out on society (Hansard, HOC, June 23,
1964, pp. 265-271). Gardner then recorded his preference for
compensation rather than harsh penalties (Hansard, HOC,
June 23, 1964), and Brighton's David James, despite his
preference for confiscating the youths' driving licenses, also
championed recompense (Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964).
While Awdry didn't like the way the Longford Committee
had blamed capitalism for the youths' "acquisitiveness," and
like other MPs in both debates bemoaned the baneful influ-
ence of the "new morality," he was not in favor of a return to
corporal punishment or any other severe measure either
(Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 278-279).
Paget then made the speech of the day. He debunked the
media claim that the Mods and Rockers were a serious prob-
lem by pointing out that the casualty departments in the
resort towns had remained empty, and then argued that
because these "exuberant types on holiday" were not even
delinquent, they "need to be treated differently." After pay-
ing compensation, "that was where the matter should end"--
not that Paget was going to stop there, because when it came
to Mods and Rockers, he believed that the real offenders
were the resort town magistrates:
These young chaps must pay for the damage they do.
. . . But I deplore the idea adopted by some magistrates
and canvassed and applauded in the newspapers of
sending young men of this sort to prison. That is a
lamentable answer to this sort of performance. We
have also had hysterical observations about Sawdust
Caesars.These people are nothing of the sort. (Hansard,
HOC, June 23, 1964, p. 280)
Thompson and Greek 11
After another MP had backed "proper compensation"
(Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 281-282), the parliamen-
tary scourge of permissiveness, Rees-Davis, MP from
Margate, rose to speak. He began by reminding the house
that the Mods and Rockers had turned up in his constituency
over Whitsun, but far from use that as a spring board to pro-
mote the media inventory, he denounced the coverage too,
reinforcing the fact that contemporary antipermissives did
not target the Mods and Rockers as a symbol of permissive-
ness at all (Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964). Mr. Curran being
a libertarian wanted to know why the government did not use
restitution as the major means to combat lawlessness as well
as vandalism (Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964). Fletcher,
being an old school Christian socialist, appealed for "more
harmless sporting diversions for youth" after school
(Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 293-295). Miss Pike, the
under secretary for the home department, then closed the
debate by promising "more imaginative sentencing" and, in
direct contradistinction to Cohen's claims, reiterated that as
the police's regular, existing machinery for dealing with out-
breaks of disorder was working, no new measures were
needed (Hansard, HOC, June 23, 1964, pp. 301-305).
Rather than reflect the "crystallization" of the media
inventory (Cohen, 1973, p. 136), the content of the speeches
referencing the disturbances reveal that the MPs raised the
issue to make favorable comparisons between the beach
invaders and other types of hooliganism. The nearest one
who gets to Cohen's inference about the debate was Teeling,
who hoped that the amendment meant that the invaders
would get an "unpleasant surprise" if they were caught van-
dalizing Brighton again. Otherwise, Rees-Davis merely
recorded their appearance in Margate, Fitch wished that the
Rockers would engage in charity rides on their bikes,
Morrison explained that he was "full of admiration" for the
younger generation, Prentice wanted to record that "it is a
rather a brave thing to be a rocker" given they were so out-
numbered, Gardner made distinctions between criminals and
the beach invaders, and Paget pointed out that as young men
were always fighting among themselves, the disturbances
were nothing new or unusual and did not amount to
criminality.
Making Sense of PanicTheory
As the omitted historical evidence clearly undermines
Cohen's account, Folk Devils is far more misleading than
the contemporary media reports. As we have demonstrated
elsewhere, as the same critique applies to five other seminal
U.K. moral panics, the paradigm has created a completely
false picture of British society since the 1970s (Thompson &
Williams, 2012). In Cohen's case, far from being swept up
in a societal-wide moral panic directed at the Mods and
Rockers, the public, the opinion formers, the moral entrepre-
neurs, and the parliamentarians not only dismissed the hor-
ror headlines but also denounced them. By 1964, British
society was so divided over "the way things were going"
that common agreement on anything was impossible.
The most generous explanation we can offer for the lack
of evidential integrity in Folk Devils is that it reflects Cohen's
determination to impose U.S. theories on circumstances that
could not support them. Although the U.K. delinquency
debate echoed that seen in the United States between 1950
and 1961, U.S. sociologists could justify their claim that
delinquency was a social construction because it reflected a
status "crime wave" caused by altering the age at which
teens could access adult pleasures, such as the drinking age
(Gilbert, 1986). Hard-core hooligans in the United Kingdom,
however, managed to generate an increase in mass hooligan-
ism and destructive vandalism without any societal encour-
agement--hence the divergence between U.S. theory and
British experience, such as the alleged power of the press to
stigmatize and the overemphasis on the supposed projecting
gang membership on miscellaneous youths, which Cohen
took from Wilkin and Yablonski, respectively (Cohen, 1969)
As the initial Clacton reaction reflected the existing media
frames about vandalism and hooliganism, and the coverage
about nonevents only appeared over the bank holiday week-
ends at a handful of resorts during the short U.K. summer
season, the media furor over Mods and Rockers is a perfect
example of the "silly season," when news stories become
even more overblown than usual because the sources of most
hard news, from the Royal Courts to Parliament close down
for summer vacations. Nothing more.
When we first drew attention to the core weakness of the
moral panic paradigm (Thompson, 1989, 1991), our fear of
uncritical promotion in the United States was dismissed on
the grounds that "it couldn't happen here," but it has. This
demonstration of the failings of the original definition makes
it imperative to question the generic description and the
"new, improved" U.S. variant given that neither can distin-
guish between a moral panic and any other kind of adverse
reaction to social groups or phenomenon. Unless one consid-
ers the real similarities and differences between moral panics
and the alternative U.S. models rather than treat them as
similes (Goode & Ben-Yehuda, 1994), the potential political
ramifications in the next decade could be far more costly
than its existing effects on academic standards.
By maintaining Cohen's simplistic division of the world
into progressives and reactionaries, omitting vital counter-
vailing evidence, while misreporting, distorting, and exag-
gerating what remains, the panic paradigm has constantly
misled its readers regarding "the way society is going." In
this case, Cohen failed to consider how during the 1960s
U.K. Christians--in the professional sample, among the
moral entrepreneurs, and parliamentarians--acted as a bul-
wark against the law and order lobby. When one's analysis of
events can be so wrong, the political response is unlikely to
secure its intent. As we first attempted to warn the United
States that the need to critique panic theory was more than an
academic dispute (Thompson, 1989), events have confirmed
12 SAGE Open
our fears (Thompson & Williams, 2012). It is no accident
that the increasing popularity of the panic paradigm with its
mismatch between theory and reality has run parallel with
the alienation between progressives and the working classes
in the United Kingdom, with disastrous results (Jones, 2011;
Waiton, 2008). With the United States at the cross roads, its
time the panic paradigm here paid attention to Pally's (2011)
revelations about U.S. evangelicals too.
