Introduction
Over the years, urban scholars' analyses of residential polar-
ization have generally followed two diametrical paths: those
that focus on revealing the residential pattern based on dwell-
ing and neighborhood quality and those that strive to provide
explanations for such pattern (Abumere, 1994; Harvey,
1975; Hwang & Quigley, 2004; Kain & Quigley, 1970).
Housing as a field of study cuts across virtually all social and
technological sciences with each proffering solutions to a set
of perceived problems. Urban polarization is a common
research problem to all social scientists although geogra-
phers are keener about spatial polarization of human activi-
ties including housing than other social scientists. While the
sociologists attempt to view residential differentiation as
resulting from the tendency for racial segregation (Krivo,
1986), the economists tend to look at residential differentia-
tion as an outcome of choice behaviors resulting from the
tendency to maximize utility (Cirman, 2006; Quigley, 1985).
Sociological and economic explanations of residential dif-
ferentiation are fraught with serious problems (Harvey,
1975). First, sociological explanation does not provide
insight beyond emphasizing the rather simplistic notion that
people of the same racial provenance live closely together,
and second, the neo-classical economic theory of utility
maximization which emphasizes differentiation based on
consumer behavior does not explain the spatial pattern of
human activities sufficiently.
However, the geographic view of residential polarization
assumes that the spatial aspect of housing quality imposes on
the cityscape a peculiar pattern which influences choices
(Aliu, 2012; Briggs, 2005; Harvey, 1975). Of all urban land
uses, housing perhaps gives the city its most glaring image
and form and this is partly because housing constitutes the
largest land use and partly because housing is a complex
physical stock. In developing economies, urban housing
markets are often characterized by both quantity and quality
variations which make home decision making quite prob-
lematic (Agbola, 2005; Ajala & Adelodun, 2007; Aluko,
2000). Generally, in terms of quantity, price, and quality, the
housing market is never a monolithic structure, but a set of
submarkets that display complex spatial variation (Abumere,
1994; Aluko, 2000; Hwang & Quigley, 2004). The nature
and basis of residential polarization in Nigerian cities within
the contemporary spatio­social realities have however
remained insufficiently explained.
The focus on Lagos residential condition is exciting for a
number of reasons. First, Lagos is a rapidly growing

Understanding Residential Polarization in
a Globalizing City: A Study of Lagos
Ibrahim Rotimi Aliu1 and Olayinka A. Ajala2
Abstract
This study examines the spatial polarization that characterizes the dwellings in the African leading megacity of Lagos.
Data were collected through an extensive housing survey carried out on 1,485 household residences in 56 wards within
12 administrative units in Lagos megacity. The spatial dimension of residential density in the city generates three unique
residential patterns which are low residential density (LRD), medium residential density (MRD), and high residential density
(HRD) areas. Descriptive and multivariate inferential statistics were used to render explanations for the spatial variations
in the residential quality variables in the study area. Findings indicated that a clear difference exists in the residential quality
within the three residential density areas of Lagos. High correlations exist among the residential quality indicators and
housing type. The principal component analysis shows that residential polarizations that occur in the LRD, MRD, and HRD
are based on the location, dwelling facility, interior and exterior quality, neighborhood integrity, social bond, barrier to entry,
and security. The practical implications of residential polarizations along the residential density areas are explicitly expressed.

megacity with a globalizing posture. The city has existed
precariously and resiliently from the colonial era assuming a
cosmopolitan look in the process of growth and evolution.
Second, it occupies a privileged position on the National
City hierarchy as the first seat of colonial power, the first
capital city of Nigeria, and obviously the most industrialized
region in the whole West African sub-region. Third, Lagos
possesses the most developed housing market in Nigeria (see
Aluko, 2000). There are three discernible spatial patterns of
housing structures in Lagos: the high-density-low-quality
residential, the medium-density-medium-quality residential,
and the low-density-high-quality residential areas (Aluko,
2000; Oduwaye, 2005). These are differentiated intra-city
regions with peculiar residential quality, price, and socioeco-
nomic characteristics.
The objectives of this study are to
1. describe and summarize the polarization of residen-
tial quality indicators in the study area,
2. analyze the correlations between the residential qual-
ity variables,
3. explore the residential quality components within the
residential density areas of the city, and
4. offer practical implications of the polarization of res-
idential quality in the megacity of Lagos.
This article contributes to literature on housing polariza-
tion in three ways: (1) It gives a fresh empirical explanation
on the residential polarization that exists in Lagos megacity,
(2) it confirms the assumption that variation in residential
quality reflects a medley of home attributes, and (3) it
reinforces the theory that these attributes can be collapsed
into a few quality variables.
Theoretical Premises
There are divergent opinions among scholars on what actu-
ally generates residential polarization within a given locality
or political entity. While some ascribe residential polariza-
tion to the external and internal designs of dwellings, others
canvass the environmental quality proposition such as public
facilities available within the neighborhood (Ajala &
Adelodun, 2007; Aliu, 2012; Aluko, 2000). Majorly, it is the
residential quality differentials that account for urban social
polarization although, social, economic, and cultural differ-
ences play obvious role. Urban scholars often conceive resi-
dential quality as minimum livable conditions of a residential
dwelling in terms of structural design, dimension of space,
and environmental suitability (Mabogunje, Hardoy, & Misra,
1978; Sumka, 1979). In addition, residential quality empha-
sizes structural solidity and durability, basic services provi-
sion, unfettered accessibility, security of tenure, security,
choice, and reduction of crowdedness (Agbola, 2005).
Putting the concept of residential quality in proper perspec-
tive, Aliu (2012), in a recent study, defines residential quality
as the structural as well as the neighborhood attributes of
dwellings in a specific location.
Theoretically, as indicated in Figure 1, housing possesses
three physical quality dimensions: location, structural, and
neighborhood quality. The structural quality reflects the
intrinsic values of houses, the location quality reflects the
positional attributes of dwelling, and the neighborhood

quality reflects the extrinsic values of the neighborhood
where houses are located (Ajala & Adelodun, 2007; Aluko,
2000; Arimah, 1992; Goodwin, 1977; Hwang & Quigley,
2004). At the theoretical level, residential quality can be
measured in terms of accessibility, drainage, serenity, secu-
rity, parking, environmental sanitation (neighborhood qual-
ity); proximity to work, children's schools, shopping centers,
places of worship, friends, and relations (location quality);
and house type, number of rooms, room space, toilets, baths,
water sources, patio, kitchen, lot size, and aesthetics (struc-
tural quality). However, residential quality is very controver-
sial and has been shown to be unique to different races
(Mabogunje et al., 1978). There is no universal residential
standard that is acceptable to all societies of the world.
Geographical and ethnographic peculiarities define more
often the type of housing quality and standard that prevail
within a particular socio­cultural setting (Dewilde &
De Keulenaer, 2003; Rapoport, 2001).
The intra-city or spatial differentiation in housing quality
has two theoretical premises. The first is the ecological
model of residential polarization. The proponents of this
theory canvass the argument that the cityscape would natu-
rally be characterized by land uses especially residential land
uses which would be antagonistic to one another and there-
fore display variegated patterns as each land use tends to
serve a particular interest of the urban dwellers. The ecologi-
cal model of residential polarization draws tremendously
from the works of classical ecological scholars notably
Burgess (1925), Hoyt (1939), and Harris and Ullman (1945).
The second theoretical premise on which intra-city residen-
tial differentiation is based is the neo-classical economic
rationalization model. The neo-classical economists have
continued to remonstrate about the operation of the housing
market which subsists on the invisible price mechanism. To
the neo-classical school of thought, the housing market con-
dition, which is invariably imperfect, determines the nature
of housing that permeates a given location and also the
socioeconomic condition of a place will go a long way to
define the existing quantity and quality of housing therein
(Adams, 1986; GilderBloom, 1980). In another way, the
quality of dwellings provided, in a place or region, depends
on the socioeconomic status of the builders. In poor societies
where people struggle to have property, the structural and
neighborhood facilities of houses are hugely compromised,
and because most renters make do with what is available,
these forms of housing are taken by the city dwellers that are
less economically privileged (Aliu & Adebayo, 2010).
However, theoretically this study leans toward the ecological
model for its adequate depiction of spatial polarizations in
urban land uses especially housing.
From theoretical evaluation of spatial polarization of
housing, we can therefore hypothesize that there is gener-
ally a significant variation in the housing quality within
the city region. Given the socioeconomic and cultural rea-
sons, housing often displays not only inter-market varia-
tions but intra-market differentiation in quality. As there
are differences in housing quality from one city to the
other or one country to the other, there are also differences
in quality from one neighborhood to the other. Residential
quality therefore can be perceived along varying geo-
graphical scales: global, regional, and local. In this study,
the differences in residential quality in three density areas
of Lagos city is considered.
Study Area
Geographically, Lagos state is located between longitudes
2o 42'and 4o 20' East and latitudes 6o 22'and 6o 42' North.
Located in the South Western region of Nigeria, Lagos State
is bounded in the east and in the north by Ogun State, in the
south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the western flank by
Republic of Benin (see Figure 2). It occupies a total land area
of 3,577 km2 representing 0.4% of Nigeria. Given the small
land area of Lagos, it invariably remains the smallest state in
Nigeria. Lagos State is characterized by tropical high cli-
mate, with high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rain-
fall, two rainfall peak regimes in June and October. The
microclimate is also influenced by the proximity to the
ocean. The rainy season in Lagos generally starts in April
extending to October with a short cool but dry spell inAugust
(August Break).
Lagos is the most urbanized and industrialized region in
Nigeria (Odumosu, 2004; Peil, 1991). It has a population of
about 10 million people, out of which about 8 million (80%)
live in the metropolis (National Population Commission
Census, 2006). Lagos is now a globalizing megacity, with
over 10 million people, and by 2020 its total population is
projected to be about 15 million (United Nations Habitat,
2008). Lagos State consists of 20 local government areas
(LGAs) among which 17 are within the megacity region.
Twelve LGAs namely Ajeromi-Ifelodun, Agege, Lagos
Island, Oshodi-Isolo, and Mushin (high residential density
[HRD]); Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos Mainland, Somolu, and
Surulere (medium residential density [MRD]); Ikeja, Apapa,
and Eti-Osa (low residential density [LRD]) form the study
area for this research (see Figure. 2). Research on housing
conditions in Lagos has been for a long time (see Abiodun,
1976; Ekanem, 1995). More recent studies reveal a predomi-
nance of multiunit housing and differentiated housing mar-
kets (Aliu, 2012; Aluko, 2000; Jiboye, 2009).
Research Design
Data and Method
Data used for this study are mainly from primary sources.
According to Arimah (1992) and Aluko (2000), primary data
if collected carefully are of higher accuracy than the second-
ary data. A multi-stage systematic random field survey was
conducted in 56 wards of 12 LGAs of Lagos to acquire the
primary data needed for the study. As many as 1,485 copies
of structured questionnaires were administered on household
4 SAGE Open
heads within the study area. The study area was divided into
three residential density areas, namely, the LRD, the MRD,
and the HRD areas, and questionnaires were distributed in
the residential areas in the ratio 1:2:3, respectively. To ensure
representativeness, the questionnaire distribution followed
the population densities of the residential areas; hence, the
highest questionnaires were administered in the HRD which
constitutes the most densely populated area and the lowest in
the LRD which is the least populated area. This means that
one sixth of the questionnaires making 270 were distributed
in the LRD, one third making 486 in the MRD, and one half
making 729 in the HRD. The questionnaires were collated,
coded, and analyzed using different descriptive and inferen-
tial techniques in the Statistical Package for Social Scientists
(SPSS version 17).
Measures of Variables
Residential quality variables are expansive and best mea-
sured by considering the exterior, environmental, and struc-
tural variables of dwellings (Ajala & Adelodun, 2007; Aliu,
2012; Aliu & Adebayo, 2012; Aluko, 2000). Hence, residen-
tial quality data in this study were measured by 20 neighbor-
hood and structural quality variables, and these are presented
in Table 1. These are the attributes of dwellings that are asso-
ciated with the dwellings occupied by Lagos residents at the
moment. The variables were drawn from both empirical lit-
erature and standard residential surveys on housing studies
in Lagos in recent time (see Aliu, 2012; Aliu & Adebayo,
2012; Aluko, 2000).
Analytical Techniques
Three analytical techniques are used to analyze the collected
data in this study. The first analytical technique involves the
use of descriptive statistics such as mean, cross tabulation,
and percentage frequency distribution. These are univariate
analytical methods that were used to describe and summarize
residential quality data. The second analytical technique is
the correlation statistics used to establish association between
pairs of residential quality variables. The third technique is
the principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA technique
is a multivariate statistical technique that has as its objectives
to take p variables s (standardized original variables) and to
find linear combination of these to produce indices Zs that
are orthogonal (Robinson, 1998). PCA is a data-reduction
technique which is used in this study to reduce many vari-
ables on location, neighborhood, and structural characteris-
tics of dwellings in the study area to a few important
components and thus explain level of contribution to total
variation observed in the residential quality data. According
to literature, PCA can be used in this way to explore the
latent components that underline patterns exhibited in a par-
ticular region or delineated area (Hardy & Bryan, 2006;
Neuman, 1997; Robinson, 1998). Several regional studies
have found the usefulness of PCA as an exploratory frame-
work (Aliu, 2012; Aliu & Adebayo, 2012; Oduwaye, 2005).
In this study, the PCA is also used to explore the residential
components that account for differentiation in residential
quality in three residential density areas of Lagos megacity
region. The PCA furnishes us with the information

concerning variables that are important using their explained
variations and thus reduce the dimensionality of the data
used. The PCA follows sequentially in aggregating the com-
ponent loadings through a set of constructs as represented in
Equation (1):
Z = + +...+
     
11 1 12 2 1p p, (1)
where Z is the loading score as a component variable
which according to Keiser criterion should not be less than 1,
1p represents the variance loading on component variable,
and p represents the original variables. But 1p represents
the weight of var (Z) = Z1, Z1 = 11 is maximized and
this is subject to the constraint given in Equation 2:
  
2 2 2
11 12 1p 1.
+ +...+ = (2)
For PCA, the variances are the Eigenvalues of the covari-
ance matrix and their extracted proportions vary in accor-
dance with the sequence as described in Equation (3):
Var Z1 var Z2 var Z3 var Zp
( ) > ( ) > ( ) ... ( ) (3)
From Equation (3), it is expected that the first component
would make higher contribution to the total variance than the
second, and the second would make higher contribution than
the third, and so on and so forth. Three parameters are sig-
nificant in the application of PCA results for pattern descrip-
tion. These are the latent variable variance (component), the
total variance, and the corresponding variance loadings of
original variables on the components (Robinson, 1998). The
Keiser, Meyer, and Okin (KMO) parameter available in the
SPSS 17 package provides a test of the adequacy of data
used, and the higher the KMO the more reliable the data. The
PCA statistical tool is useful in sieving the variables of
redundancy and therefore emphasizing the more relevant
variables (Hardy & Bryan, 2006). The PCA method is used
to extract the relevant residential quality variables that are
crucial to the explanation of residential polarization in the
study area. However, methodologically Varimax method
which allows orthogonal rotation was used to produce uncor-
related component loadings and outputs that are more com-
prehensible for the explanation required in the study (Aliu &
Adebayo, 2012; Oduwaye, 2005).

neighborhoods and these include metropolitan characteristics,
security, accessibility, layout, and environmental quality.
Others are spatial proximity to workplace, school, market,
worship places, hospital, and closeness to friends and relations
(Table 2). As indicated in Table 2, houses that are located in
the city core areas are barely 34.3% compared with 65.7% that
are located in the outer-city core areas. Majority of the houses
are in neighborhoods closer to places of work, hospital, chil-
dren schools, religious centers (churches and mosques), and
local markets or shopping centers. These spatial patterns
reflect the tendency among the residents in the study area to
minimize the cost of transportation to the activity places (Aliu,
2012; Hoong & Foong, 2006). Accessibility is viewed in this
study as having unhindered opportunity to public transport by
the residents. There are two categories of accessibility namely
limited accessibility and reasonable accessibility. Findings as
shown in Table 2 indicate that majority of the dwellings in
Lagos, which is 82.9%, are situated in areas that are reason-
ably accessible to public transport. Large proportions are also
in mixed layout, good environmental quality, and formal secu-
rity neighborhoods.
The structural features of dwellings in Lagos are described
by six variables. The first is the housing type of dwelling
units in the study area. As presented in Table 3, analysis indi-
cates that majority (66.1%) of the dwellings are multi-family
unit localized as "face-me-I-face-you,"1 while 31.2% are
flats, and 2.7% are duplex. The preponderance of face-me-I-
face-you housing units in Lagos has been well explained in
Aliu and Ajala 7
some recent studies (Aliu & Adebayo, 2010, 2012). The sec-
ond is the number of rooms in each dwelling unit. Number of
rooms is categorized into two that is 1 to 2 rooms and
3 rooms and more. According to information in Table 3,
majority of the houses representing 55% contain 1 to 2
rooms. The third structural quality observed in the study area
is the room space in the dwelling units, and findings indicate
that 56.9% consist of large living rooms (see Table 3). The
fourth attribute of the dwelling units studied is the number of
toilets and baths provided within each dwelling in the study
area. Analysis indicates that 58.4% of the dwellings have 1
bath and 1 toilet facility, and the rest (41.6%) of them possess
2 to 3 toilet and bath facilities. The fifth structural quality
variable of the dwelling units examined is the nature of the
Kitchen provided and results show that 78.2% of the units
actually have untiled kitchen, compared with 21.8% of the
units that do have tiled kitchen. The sixth attribute is the inte-
rior design of the dwelling and results presented in Table 3
also indicate that about 96% of the dwellings can be said to
be of poor quality given their interior conditions. These
results confirm recent observations on dwelling conditions
by previous studies in Nigerian cities (Ajala & Adelodun,
2007; Aliu & Adebayo, 2010, 2012; Aluko, 2000; Arimah,
1992).
Other residential quality variables (which are not strictly
speaking structural attributes of dwellings, but rather socio-
economic quality attributes) include water supply, tenure
type, and annual rents. On the account of the type of water
available in the dwelling units, analysis shows that 59.3% of
the dwellings in Lagos have pipe-borne/borehole water as
against 40.7% dwellings with well/water vendor. The issue
of tenure often reflects in the macro-economic performance
of the country and it is a measure of urban economic perfor-
mance (Krivo, 1986; Towry-Coker, 2012). The tenure type is
split into two that is owner-occupier and renter. From infor-
mation in Table 3, the rental dwellings form the majority

making 59.5%, while the rest of the dwellings have owner-
occupier. And last, the dwelling unit costs or rents are con-
sidered for analysis. Results indicate that dwelling units with
a rent of N201,000 to N401,000 per annum are in the major-
ity (44.3%) compared with others: N200,000 and less
(43.4%) and N401,000 and above (12.3%) rents per annum.
The spatial patterns of these residential quality variables
indicate significant intergroup independence with chi-square
(2) values all significant at 99.9% alpha levels.
Bivariate Analysis of Residential Polarization in
Lagos
The normal practice when using PCA as an exploratory
framework is to begin with the correlation of the variables of
interest as this provides the initial insights into the nature and
extent of associations among the variables (Aliu & Adebayo,
2012; Hardy & Bryan, 2006; Robinson, 1998). In this study,
there are 20 residential variables of interest. Bivariate zero-
order correlation analysis shows that these variables corre-
late to a lesser degree with one another. According to
information in Table 4, the highest correlations exist between
multiunit house type and 1 to 2 room units (r = 0.864) as also
between 1 toilet/bath and 1 to 2 room dwellings (r = 0.822).
The lowest correlations exist between dwellings with formal
security and neighborhood with poor exterior quality
(r = 0.003) and between 0 to 4 km proximity to relations and
neighborhood with poor exterior quality (r = 0.001).
Among the structural quality variables house type, num-
ber of rooms, toilets, and baths, kitchen, and price have high
and significant correlations with a number of other variables.
For instance, house type is highly and significantly corre-
lated with number of room (r = 0.864), toilet and bath
(r = 0.791), kitchen (r = 0.544), and price (r = 0.720). This
means that housing types are associated with rooms, number
of toilets and baths, nature of kitchen, and home rentals level.
Number of rooms is also significantly correlated with toilets
and baths (r = 0.822), kitchen (r = 0.521), and price
(r = 0.712). The association between price and number of
rooms is understandable as room number is a function of cost
per room. Toilet and bath correlates with kitchen (r = 0.587)
and price (r = 0.707) and kitchen correlates highly with price
(r = 0.545). However, three variables stand out very distinc-
tively among the neighborhood variables in their unique low
and negative correlations with other variables and these are
metropolitan area, social relations, and security (see Table 4
columns 1, 7, and 9).
The implication is that variables with strong correlations
with one another are expected to load similarly on the same
PCA latent components (see Aliu, 2012; Aliu & Adebayo,
2012). Hence, from the results of the correlations in Table 4,
one might begin to see that variables such as price/rent, num-
ber of rooms, toilet and bath, and kitchen would load on the
same component, just as variables that have extremely low
coefficients load separately on different components.
Multivariate Analysis of Residential Polarization in
Lagos Megacity
Although dwellings often display varying number of quality
indicators, only few of these indicators actually influence the
spatial organization of the housing market (Aliu, 2012; Aliu
& Adebayo, 2012; Arimah, 1992; Hoong & Foong, 2006;
Quigley, 1985). To determine these few residential quality
variables, we use PCA. As indicated in Tables 5 through 8,
four PCA results are generated for explaining the essential
components that summarily describe residential quality
structure in Lagos. Eight latent variables were extracted from
the rotated PCA of 20 original variables used to represent the
neighborhood and structural quality of dwelling units of
Lagos residents. The PCA components of variables with a
minimum loading of 0.40 and at least two distinct variables
were used to facilitate easy explanation. The eight latent
component variables extracted in this study accounted for
77.7% of the variance in the data set in all residential density
(ARD), 71.4% in LRD, 80.0% in MRD, and 77.8% in HRD,
respectively. The KMO tests of data adequacy are respec-
tively 0.874, 0.791, 0.848, and 0.862 and are all significantly
high. However, based on theoretical assumption of the Kaiser
criterion, only five of these eight components are important
to the explanation of the total variance of 64.1% of residen-
tial attributes that shape housing polarization in Lagos . The
remaining components have less than 1.0 Eigenvalue and
just one significantly high loading variable on each of them.
More components have been extracted in some cases. For
instance, Opoku and Abdul-Muhmin (2010) extracted nine
components, while Kain and Quigley (1970) extracted five
components.
A look at Table 5 indicates that five dwelling unit quality
variables, namely, number of rooms, house type, number of
toilets and baths, kitchen, and price/rent strongly load on
Component I with Eigenvalue of 6.1 and Variance of 30.7%.
This component is therefore named "Dwelling Facility-
Quality I," as it contains dwelling variables that are of
immense usefulness within the residential unit structure. The
second component contains six variables, namely, proximity
to hospital, school, market, worship, work, and space with
loadings well over 0.40 each. This component is appropri-
ately named "Location Proximity-Quality II." The third
component has high loadings on three variables: layout,
exterior quality, and accessibility. This component is there-
fore named "Neighborhood Exterior-Quality III." The fourth
component contains high loadings on two structural quality
variables of water and interior quality and it is therefore
called "Dwelling Interior-Quality IV." Metropolitan charac-
teristic variable represented by outer city loads singly and

negatively on the fifth component which is also called
"Neighborhood-Integrity V."
The fifth component contains variables with many nega-
tive loadings indicating lack of association between the dis-
trict of residence and such variables as proximity to work,
place of worship, market, school, and layout. The sixth,
seven, and eight components also contain quite a number of
variables with low and negative loadings except relations
which loads very strongly on the sixth (Social Bond V), ten-
ure on the seventh (Barrier to Entry VI), and security on the
eight component (Security/Safety Quality VIII). However,
spatial variations exist in the structure of the components
across residential density areas. As indicated in Table 6, for
instance in the LRD, the first component "Dwelling Facility-
Quality I" accounts for nearly 24% of the total variance in
the set, the second "Neighborhood Exterior-Quality II"
account for 12.7%, followed by "Location Proximity-Quality
III & IV" 14.5%, "Neighborhood-Integrity V" 5.6%,
"Dwelling Interior-Quality VI" 5.2%, "Barrier-to-entry VII"
5%, "Security/Safety-Quality VIII" 4.6%. Six components
based on Kaiser Criterion are important in this LRD and they
account for 61.8% of the total variance. Incidentally, a com-
ponent "Social-Bond" has no distinct presence in this region
as it merges with component VII. As there is slight
rearrangement in the components so in the variables that
account for them. Component I contains in addition to the
previous variables interior quality, while hospital and wor-
ship load on Component IV.
The situation in the MRD presents a different revelation
as the arrangement of the components is different from those
discovered in LRD. Extracting the same eight components as
in LRD, results of PCA components in MRD are more inter-
esting. The first component to be extracted in the MRD is
"Dwelling Facility-Quality I," followed by "Location
Proximity-Quality II," "Neighborhood Exterior-Quality III,"
"Neighborhood Integrity-Safety IV," "Social-Bond V,"
"Dwelling Interior-Quality VI & VII," and "Barrier-to-entry
VIII." The components, respectively, account for 30.5%,
15.2%, 8.2%, 6.9%, 5.9%, 4.8%, 4.3%, and 4.3% of the total
variance in the data set (see Table 7).
Although the same numbers of components were extracted
in the LRD and MRD, the arrangement and loading values
differ significantly. The MRD loadings perhaps display the
most inconsistent orientation, as many variables load in mul-
tiples on different components--for instance, work, accessi-
bility, space, security, interior quality, and kitchen. Like the
ARD components, the pattern displayed in MRD is a bit anti-
thetical to the normal trend. The explanation for this unusual

variation from expectation may be that the MRD, in terms of
socioeconomic attributes, falls between the low economic
status of residents in HRD and high economic status of resi-
dents in LRD (Aliu, 2012). Only five components that
account for 66.7% of the variance are important in explain-
ing residential quality variables in the MRD of the study
area. The PCA results in HRD as shown in Table 8 present a
different pattern from two previously discussed areas. Eight
components account for 77.8% of the total variation in resi-
dential quality data used in the study. The first component
"Location Proximity-Quality I" accounts for 27.6%,
"Dwelling Facility-Quality II" 15.4%, "Dwelling Interior-
Quality III" 7.6%, "Neighborhood Exterior-Quality IV"
7.1%, "Neighborhood-Integrity V" 5.9%, "Security/Safety-
Quality VI" 5.1%, "Social-Bond VII" 4.8%, and "Barrier-to-
entry VIII" 4.2% of the variance observed in the set.
According to information in Table 8, six variables loaded
heavily and positively on the first component and four on the
second component. Out of the four variables that loaded on
the second component, number of rooms, number of toilets
and baths, and house type are the most substantial residential
quality variables. All the variables except accessibility con-
sistently load on the expected components. The accessibility
variable loads on two components (V and VI) and this
confirms its inconsistency in housing quality provision.
Incidentally, only six components that account for 68.8% of
the variance are important in explaining the residential qual-
ity variations in the HRD part of the study area. Although
previous studies do not differentiate clearly among the den-
sity areas they however, found that variation exist among the
residential variables as they load on the components (Aliu &
Adebayo, 2012).
Conclusions and Practical Implications
This article explores the nature and pattern of residential
polarization in a foremost African megacity, Lagos. The key
findings from this study have indicated a marked differentia-
tion in the residential quality components in the three resi-
dential density areas of Lagos as proposed in the theoretical
section of this article. Using the exploratory PCA approach,
the 20 residential quality variables responsible for this
polarization were explained by few components which
are dwelling-facility, location-proximity, interior, exterior,
neighborhood-integrity, social-bond, barrier to entry, and
security components. However, these components are nei-
ther consistently extracted nor equally valued within the
three residential density areas. For instance, in the LRD,

Dwelling Facility-Quality, Neighborhood Exterior-Quality,
and Location Proximity-Quality components are the first
three components. But in the MRD, the Dwelling Facility,
Location Proximity, and Neighborhood Exterior-Quality
components are the first three. Also, in the HRD, Location
Proximity, Dwelling Facility, and Dwelling Interior-Water
Quality components are the first three residential compo-
nents extracted. The compositional disparity occurs due to
the dwelling peculiarities of residential density areas. These
indicate that residential polarizations do not just happen;
they are produced and patterned by a combination of features
in different locations (Abumere, 1994; Aliu, 2012; Harvey,
1975; Kain & Quigley, 1970).
Although, the results do not perfectly confirm the eco-
logical model in the modes of explanation rendered by
Burgess or Hoyt, yet they offer explanation on the peculiar
housing patterns and the ways home quality bears implicit
relationship with home prices/rents in African cities. The
variations in the components indicate a decreasing promi-
nence of some variables for instance, social relation, barrier
to entry, and security and an increasing importance of dwell-
ing facilities, location, and neighborhood quality in the spa-
tial polarization of the city built environment. These
variations can be further expatiated in the light of historical
and political development of cities in developing countries
where due to colonial and traditional factors, dwellings in the
core city areas reflect lower qualities compared with those in
the Government Residential Areas or the LRD (Abiodun,
1976; Abumere, 1994; Arimah, 1992; Mabogunje et al.,
1978). In the case of Lagos, the HRD and parts of MRD are
characterized by unplanned, informal, and traditional multi-
unit apartments, unlike the LRD areas that are characterized
by planned, formal, and modern residential structures.
Theoretically, these results interrogate the fluidity of housing
quality variables that urban scholars use to describe housing
polarization and home values in developing economies.
Besides the theoretical implications, findings from this
study also have a number of practical implications for prop-
erty management, urban designs, and sustainability of the
city. The Dwelling Facility, Neighborhood, and Location
Proximity-Quality components remain the most important
components that account for differentiation in residential
dwellings in Lagos megacity. In all, the four rotated matrices,
price/rent is consistently high and positively loaded on
Dwelling Facility-Quality component. It shows that the most
important price determining quality variables are the dwell-
ing facility variables (Aluko, 2000; Hwang & Quigley, 2004;
Kain & Quigley, 1970). The correlations that dwelling qual-
ity variables bear with prices are understandable as quality
homes have a lot to do with costs expended on the structural
and neighborhood attributes of dwellings. These findings are
important for developers and surveyors who need to under-
stand the spatio­structural dynamics of home quality and
residential valuation. However, good valuation of property
requires constant management of structural and neighbor-
hood facilities. No matter how well designed and constructed
residential dwellings are at the time of construction, after a
while, deterioration will set in except in cases where atten-
tion is given to the structural and environmental manage-
ment of the building. A proper building management and
maintenance culture does not only elongate the physical life
of individual buildings, but also enhances the future value of
the property as an economic entity (Arimah, 1992; Kain &
Quigley, 1970).
The findings from this study are of immense importance
to urban designers. Basically the dwellings that permeate the
three residential density areas are relatively different as
dwellings in the HRD and MRD display lower quality level
than those in the LRD. This apparent residential polarization
shows that intervention policies on residential improvement
or rehabilitation should avoid blanket application of the same
measures on the whole city. Instead, corrective measures
should be made in accordance with the peculiarities of the
residential density areas. The discernible polarization of
dwelling quality in Lagos can be addressed through urban
design methods such as gentrification. In the core city (HRD)
areas of Lagos, majority of the residential dwellings were
built many years ago with little attention to the structural and
environmental quality (see Abiodun, 1976; Ekanem, 1995;
Towry-Coker, 2012). This has been attributed partly to the
poor financial capacity of the owners and partly to the low
economic power of the potential renters. Most of these old
dwellings are presently in decrepit conditions and need reha-
bilitation. However, the nature of tenure, where the owners
are the grandchildren of the first owner may stand in the way
of their improvement. For reasons bordering on tradition and
culture, in the core areas of Lagos, majority of the buildings
are jointly owned by second to fourth generation of the origi-
nal owners. The children hardly agree to either sell or engage
property developers to construct befitting modern structures
to replace the blighted ones. Gentrification in highly polar-
ized urban environment like Lagos will impact the property
and environmental conditions in two important ways. One,
gentrification will provide further vacancies for better resi-
dential units through filtering; and two, it will engender envi-
ronmental sustainability of the city. In contemporary urban
planning thinking, residential dwellings are crucial compo-
nents of urban design and sustainable city growth (Echenique,
Hargreaves, Mitchell, & Namdeo, 2012).

Note
1. Face-me-I-face-you is a localized term often used to describe
the traditional housing unit commonly found in Nigerian cities
14 SAGE Open
and hinterlands. It is commonly designed to suit many house-
holds living within a single residential structure. By design,
this kind of dwelling contains multiple living rooms sometimes
with no resting room (parlor). The rooms are laid facing each
other in opposite direction and could be 4 to 6 on each side,
with a narrow passage dividing the two sides. Rooms face one
another directly in such a way that one household can not do
without contacting others, hence the name face-me-I-face-you.
The rooms are usually about 3 × 3 m2 or 3 × 4 m2 in dimen-
sions (Aliu & Adebayo, 2012). In densely populated cities like
Lagos, the multiunit dwellings are space-efficient designs that
could harbor large household sizes with up to 6 or more per-
sons per unit. They are characterized by one common kitchen,
a bath, and at both sides of the building two exit doors. Face-
me-I-face-you dwellings do not have in most cases perimeter
fences or gates.
