The unprecedented growth and competition in the service sector urge service marketers
to pay greater attention to all the antecedents that promote positive customer experience
and customer loyalty. Among the ways that help organizations monitor and improve
these two desired customer outcomes, the present study has focused on the work
engagement and job crafting attitude of service employees.
Employee work engagement is an employee attitude, characterized by vigour, dedica-
tion and engrossments, thus making employees feel attentive, integrated and focused
in their work environment. Although the literature suggests several antecedents to
employee engagement, this study has focused on job crafting attitudes of employees in
the service context. Job crafting is a bottom-top approach whereby employees alter the
boundaries of their jobs as per their interests, tastes, preferences, experience and quali-
fications on their own initiative.
Little research has focused on understanding the relevance of both the concepts of work
engagement and job crafting of service employees to desired customer outcomes, espe-
cially with reference to a developing country like India. Using path analysis, the study
indicates that both customer satisfaction and loyalty to their service firms are signifi-
cantly influenced by the work engagement level and several job crafting attitudes as
exhibited by service employees in retail banking service setting. Specifically, job crafting
attitudes of service employees like increasing structural job resources, decreasing
hindering job demands, increasing social job resources and increasing challenging job
demands are found pivotal antecedents to desired customer outcomes. The study also
indicates employee work engagement effectively mediating the relationship between
job crafting of service employees and desired customer outcomes, thus connecting the
benefits of job crafting of service employees to service performance.
These direct and indirect causal relationships emphasize the relevance of the constructs
in the service context. The study discusses several implications for service managers
particularly in the area of reward and appraisal system of organizations.

278 WORK ENGAGEMENT AND JOB CRAFTING OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INFLUENCING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES
The unprecedented growth and severe competi-
tion in the service sector urge service marketers
to pay greater attention to all the antecedents
that ensure customers' positive experience and conse-
quently their loyalty. Practitioners can monitor various
antecedents that have a direct and positive influ-
ence upon these desired measures of performance.
Similarly, there can be several drivers that engender
desired employee job attitudes, which in turn can then
trigger customers' positive experience and their loyalty.
The literature supports the idea that the way employees
define their roles or make modifications in the already
assigned job role, known as job crafting, has a direct
bearing on their decisions to behave at the workplace and
their consequent performance. Based on this idea, the
present study attempts to identify the root of customers'
positive experience and their loyalty around the construct
of job crafting of service employees in a retail banking
service setting. However, work engagement is consid-
ered as a connecting link between job crafting and the
final outcome, that is, customers' positive experience and
their loyalty as considered in the present study.
The significance of customer loyalty as a measure of
performance draws sufficient support from the liter-
ature as it is the only viable and profitable option in
times of hyper competition (Verma, 2001). Any lapse on
the part of the service manager on this front will surely
prompt customers to exit the relationship with the
service provider, thus affecting the profitability. Apart
from the pressure of market competition, firms other-
wise also have to be concerned for customer loyalty
inasmuch as it brings benefits to the firms. The most
common advantage is the firm's ability to retain most
profitable customers (e.g., Heskett, Jones, Loveman,
Sassar, & Schlesinger, 1994) and remain effective both
at the operational and strategic levels (Robert & Mark,
2011). Owing to continuously dealing with the same
group of customers over a long period, the firms are
better able to understand the specific requirements of
their customers that help them attain efficiency and
effectiveness. This, in turn, proves loyal customers
as more profitable (Dawkins & Reichheld, 1990; Paul
& Earl, 2011). Furthermore, it costs five times more to
attract new customers than to maintain the relationship
with the existing customers (Clancy & Schulman, 1994).
Research also suggests that an improvement of 5 per
cent in customer retention results in an improvement
of 100 per cent in profits (Rachel, Andy, & Cheng, 2011;
Reichheld & Sasser, 1990).
Countless studies in the past have indicated customer
loyalty as a direct function of customer satisfaction
(e.g., Berry, 1995; Christopher, 2012; Kelley & Davis,
1994; Schneider & Bowen, 1985). Therefore, service
marketers should primarily be concerned about all
those aspects that maintain and improve customer
satisfaction to ensure other desired customer outcomes
including customer loyalty.
The quality of service employees is the direct reflection
of the quality of the whole organization and the conse-
quent service experience of the customer. Therefore, all
the aspects having bearing on the service employee job
attitudes and their overall quality need to be looked at
more professionally by service marketers to monitor
customers' satisfaction and consequently their loyalty.
Service marketers may find several factors that shape
the desired service employee attitudes at the work-
place. However, this study focuses on work engage-
ment and job crafting of service employees.
WORK ENGAGEMENT
The term work engagement was first coined by Kahn
(1990), who referred to it as workers' positive attitude
at their workplace. Accordingly, apart from psycho-
logical presence, the workers expressed themselves
physically, cognitively and emotionally at their work-
places. In his pioneering work, Kahn also referred to
it as workers' `self-in-role', whereby they put their self
in their work roles, thus making themselves feel atten-
tive, connected, integrated and focused in their work
environment (Kahn, 1992). Kahn (1990, 1992) further
explained that work engagement was a function of
three important factors. First, the purpose workers
attached to their work role. Second, the psycholog-
ical safety workers enjoyed to ensure that their work
would not result in any undesired reward. Finally, the
accessibility and availability of job resources that were
required to perform one's required role.
Saks (2006, p. 602) recently defined work engagement as
`a distinct and unique construct consisting of cognitive,
emotional and behavioural components ... associated
with individual role performance'. Conceptualizing
work engagement as a construct that includes long-
term emotional involvement with the work role, Saks
(2006) emphasized its consequential side. Accordingly,
it exerts its positive influence on workers' motivation
and several positive organizational outcomes (Wagner
& Harter, 2006). More recently, work engagement has
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 279
been referred to as workers' psychological immersion,
striving, absorption, focus and involvement in their
work roles (Bakker, 2011; Macey, Schneider, Barbera, &
Young, 2009).
Many researchers believe that the work done by
Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonza´lez-Roma´, and Bakker,
(2002) was a major breakthrough in this area. Schaufeli
and his associates conceptualized work engagement
as a three-dimensional construct that included dimen-
sions such as vigour, dedication and absorption. The
authors defined work engagement as `a positive,
fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by
vigour, dedication, and absorption'. Schaufeli et al.
(2002) referred to `vigour' as the workers' state of mind
characterized by feeling energetic, willing to put higher
work efforts in one's work and the feeling of continuing
to work in spite of difficulties. `Dedication' is indicated
as worker's enthusiasm triggered by sensing work as
meaningful, challenging as well as inspiring. Finally,
`absorption' is worker's engrossment in work role to
such an extent that s/he feels as if time passes very fast
and does not feel like withdrawing from the workplace.
A different perspective of looking at the construct of
work engagement is to consider it as something oppo-
site of workers' burnout (Gonzalez, Schaufeli, Bakker,
& Lloret, 2006; Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001). The
general argument of these burnout scholars is that
work engagement comprises attitudes such as energy,
involvement and efficacy. These are the direct oppo-
sites of the three dimensions, namely, exhaustion, cyni-
cism and inefficacy, or all that constitute the construct
of burnout.
Management generally endeavours for desired
employee job attitudes for they are vital for organi-
zational performance. Among these, organizational
citizenship behaviour (Saks, 2006; Schaufeli & Bakker,
2004), employee enthusiasm and sense of belonging-
ness to organization (Buckingham & Coffman, 1999),
job satisfaction (Richman, 2006), lower employee turn-
over intentions (e.g., Hakanen, Bakker, & Schaufeli,
2006; Lloyd, 2008; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) and
better health and work performance (Sonnentag,
2003) are some of the significant attitudes that have
been indicated as a function of work engagement in
the past. More recently, some studies have revealed
that engaged employees are able to develop warm,
trusting relationships with their workmates and tend
to develop and grow as a person (Diener et al., 2010).
Furthermore, organizational performance variables
such as business returns (Davenport & Harding, 2012;
Richman, 2006; Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti,
& Schaufeli, 2009), employee productivity and job
performance (Bakker & Bal, 2010; Halbesleben &
Wheeler, 2008) and customer positive experience
(Richman, 2006; Salanova, Agut, & Peiro, 2005) have
also been associated with work engagement.
Thus, work engagement is one of the crucial areas
that the service managers cannot afford to overlook.
However, what is more important is to look for all
those aspects that engender work engagement among
employees to reap its possible benefits as discussed
earlier. Drawing from the literature, the service prac-
titioners can find several factors that could drive work
engagement amongst their employees. The present
study focuses on job crafting of service employees that
is assumed to promote work engagement and ensure
its consequent benefits to service organizations.
JOB CRAFTING: A LITERATURE REVIEW
The concept of job crafting was first introduced by
Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) as an extension
of the concept of job design that is considered as a
top-down function of managers to formally design
jobs of their subordinates. It is referred to as the
process by which managers decide individual job
tasks and the required authority for their subordi-
nates (Gibson, Ivancevich, & Donnelly, 1994; Greg
& Hackman, 2010). Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001)
drew attention towards the significance of employees
in making modifications to the already designed jobs
by the management. The authors referred to it as a
bottom-top approach, whereby employees altered the
boundaries of their jobs as per their interests, tastes,
preferences and qualifications on their own initia-
tive. Such modifications in jobs could be in the form
of performing tasks differently than others or making
additions or reductions in the number of tasks (phys-
ical crafting). The modifications could also include
changing the relational boundaries at the workplace
(Berg, Wrzesniewski, & Dutton, 2010), that is, the
employees decide about the frequency and the quality
with which they may interact with others at the work-
place (relational crafting). Finally, the employees
could have their own way of perceiving different
tasks and relationships between those tasks (cognitive
crafting) that could result into a job as a whole (Leana,
Applebaum, & Shevchuk, 2009; Tims & Bakker, 2010;
Tims, Bakker, & Derks, 2012; Wrzesniewski & Dutton,
2001; Wrzesniewski, Boluglio, & Berg, 2012).
280 WORK ENGAGEMENT AND JOB CRAFTING OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INFLUENCING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES
The job alterations initiated by employees according
to Tims et al. (2012) are mainly done to maintain a
balance between job demands and job resources
so perceived by the employees in their work
environment. Thus, conceptualizing job crafting as
employee-initiated changes with an aim to evade the
kind of mismatch, Tims et al. (2012) argued that these
job alterations carried out by employees could be
mainly of four categories.
· Increasing structural job resources: In order to
improve the performance both at the employee
and the organizational levels, employees may
strive to enhance the structural resources such
as demanding variety in their resources, more
autonomy, responsibility improving job know-how
from their employers to attain self-development
and seeking more opportunity for their growth and
advancement.
· Decreasing hindering job demands: Employees may
reducethenumberoftasksbydoingawaywithsome
of the tasks they feel both physically and psycholog-
ically uncomfortable with or they may consciously
avoid engagements that make their overall job over-
whelming. Avoiding working for long hours, taking
complicated decisions or ignoring people who can
affect them emotionally are some of the instances of
this kind of crafting.
· Increasing social job resources: In the interest of
improvement in performance, employees may seek
guidance, opinions and feedback from superiors,
subordinates and peers, and, thus, can build up a
desiredsocialsupportintheworkenvironment.This
social support has bearing on their job performance.
· Increasing challenging job demands: In order to
maintain interest and avoid boredom in one's job,
employees may attempt to broaden the scope of their
job or mix and remix the tasks of the job to make it
more challenging. Taking on extra responsibilities
and exhibiting interest in new job developments
and assignments are some job crafting initiatives by
employees.
Researchers purport several desired outcomes from job
crafting in the organizational context. These outcomes
include better performance (Worline, Wrzesniewski, &
Rafaeli, 2002), employee commitment, job effectiveness
and lower absenteeism (Ghitulescu, 2006); employee
initiative, persistence and action (Crant, 1995); job satis-
faction (Berg, Dutton, & Wrzesniewski, 2008; Warr &
Inceoglu, 2012); cultivating employee work identity
and meaning (Wrzesniewski et al., 2012); employee
retention (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson,
2005); employee pro-activity (Caza, 2007; Lyons, 2008);
person­environment fit and consequent lower stress
(Sulsky & Smith, 2005); and colleague ratings of in-role
performance (Bakker, Tims, & Derks, 2012).
Work Engagement as a Result of Job Crafting
The job demands­resources (JD-R) model (Demerouti,
Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001) has classified
work environment, irrespective of occupations, mainly
into two categories. First, job demands that refer to
physical, psychological and social aspects of the job.
These require cognitive or emotional efforts on the
part of employee. The presence of these demands acti-
vates a process of exhaustion characterized by high
levels of demands in the work environment. This, in
turn, reduces both mental and physical energy, and
consequently increases fatigue, burnout and health
complaints of employees (Schaufeli, Leiter, & Maslach,
2009). Second, job resources are physical, psycholog-
ical and social aspects of the job that not only facili-
tate employee performance but also help them grow
at the individual level. The instances of job resources
are autonomy, skill variety, feedback, task significance,
opportunities for growth, job security, rewards and
social relations (Bakker, Demerouti, & Verbeke, 2004).
These resources activate the motivational process, char-
acterized by higher levels of employee willingness to
spend energy, better performance and work engage-
ment (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008, 2013).
Job crafters make alterations in their jobs mainly
to reduce job demands and increase job resources.
Consequently, their fatigue, burnout and other
associated ill effects of the first process of motivation
as discussed above are expected to be checked by
decreasing job demands via job crafting. Again
the second process, characterized by higher levels
of employee willingness to spend energy, better
performance and work engagement, is also expected
to be activated by increasing job resources. Specifically,
Tims et al. (2012) referred to job crafting as employee
attitude aimed at increasing structural job resources,
decreasing hindering job demands, increasing social
job resources and increasing challenging job demands
by an employee. These efforts on the part of employees
are actually job alterations mainly carried out either
to increase job resources or decrease job demands.
Considering the above discussion about the two
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 281
motivational processes as a reason of job demands and
job resources, it is arguable that job crafting may not
only offset the de-motivating effects (by decreasing
job demands) but also set the process of motivation
in action (by increasing job resources). Therefore,
job crafting is expected to positively affect employee
motivation, dedication, effort level, commitment and,
hence, their engagement (Crawford, Lepine, & Rich,
2010). Furthermore, Demerouti et al. (2001) have
referred to work engagement as the crucial variable
in the motivational process. Accordingly, the first
hypothesis of the study is proposed as:
H1: Greaterthelevelofjobcraftingofserviceemployees,
greater will be their work engagement.
Customer Outcomes as a Result of Work
Engagement
The engaged employees generally invest considerable
amount of their work effort into behaviours that are
appropriate for performing their work roles inasmuch
as work engagement is employees' attitude character-
ized by vigour, dedication and absorption at their work-
place (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Work effort is significant in
terms of the process and mechanism that convert moti-
vation into an accomplished task (Walker, Churchill,
& Ford, 1977). Thus, those who are engaged are more
likely to perform better as a result of higher motivation
for work (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008). Furthermore,
engagement also influences customers' positive expe-
rience indirectly through employee job satisfaction.
Employees who put considerable effort into their roles
are able to improve their sense of efficacy, self-determi-
nation and consequently trigger motivation (e.g., Saks,
2006). Consequently, they prove to be more resourceful
for customers to understand their emotions, require-
ments and expectations during the service interaction.
Engaged workers feel attentive, connected, integrated
and focused at their job places (Kahn, 1992), emotion-
ally committed in the long run to their organization
(Buckingham & Coffman, 1999; Wagner & Harter,
2006). These attitudes improve the sense of connect-
edness, mutual support, freedom of expression and
genuine caring for each other within the work group
and consequently help in rendering better customer
service. In view of these arguments, it sounds reason-
able to propose the following:
H2: 
Greater the service employee work engagement,
greater will be the customer outcomes.
Customer Outcomes as a Result of Job Crafting
Job crafting has positive motivational effects on
employees. When employees are offered the scope to
craft their jobs as per their tastes, preferences, experi-
ence and qualifications, it makes them feel authorized.
This kind of feeling or what has been referred to as
`self-perceived decision-making authority' is a driving
force for the customer orientation of service employees
(COSE) and consequent customer satisfaction (Brown,
Mowen, Donavan, & Licata, 2002; Heejung & PoJu, 2011;
Hennig-Thurau, 2004; Hennig-Thurau & Thurau, 2003;
Siddiqi, 2009). Furthermore, both the self-perceived
decision-making authority and consequent perceived
better performance make employees feel that their jobs
are more worthwhile, meaningful or something they
should take pride in. Thus, it increases their job satis-
faction, sense of self-respect, self-identification and
belongingness to their roles. Scholars of identity theory
(e.g., Loscocco, 1989) and those of job satisfaction (e.g.,
Daan Van, 2000; Mackenzie, Podsakoff, & Ahearne,
1998; Yoon & Suh, 2003) have long been advocating
these positive feelings as significant for efficient service
delivery and consequent desired customer outcomes.
Finally, on enjoying the latitude of making alterations
in their jobs and the consequent satisfaction (Carsten,
Schermuly, & Schermuly, 2011), job crafters, in turn,
are expected to find ways to reciprocate and benefit
their organizations. This is aligned with the view of
the theorists (Shore & Shore, 1995) of social exchange
theory and the rule of reciprocity. In the service context,
offering the best possible customer service and satisfac-
tion to firm's customers is the most appropriate way for
these job crafters to reciprocate and express their posi-
tive feelings.
Research studies in the past have advocated customer
satisfaction as one of the most significant drivers of
customer loyalty with the existing firm (Christopher,
2012; Kelley & Davis, 1994). It seems to be also logi-
cally true that customers will prefer to continue with
the existing firm rather than unnecessarily switching to
any other firm if their expectations are duly fulfilled by
the existing service provider (Crosby, Evans, & Cowles,
1990; Daniel, Christopher, & Philip, 2011). Therefore,
the above discussion that establishes a link between
job crafting of service employees and customer satis-
faction also supports the relevance of job crafting to
customer loyalty. Accordingly, the following assump-
tion is proposed:
282 WORK ENGAGEMENT AND JOB CRAFTING OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INFLUENCING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES
H3: The greater the job crafting of service employee, the
greater will be the customer outcomes (customer
satisfaction and customer loyalty in this study).
The discussion and the pertinent literature above
have clarified not only the concepts under reference
but also the basis for several assumptions. These
assumptions have prompted the author to propose
several hypotheses of the study (H1­H3). Drawing
on the past literature, the author assumes job crafting
to influence work engagement that, in turn, is related
to customer outcomes. In such circumstances, work
engagement happens to be both dependent and
independent variables in between job crafting and
customer outcomes. Additionally, job crafting is also
assumed as a direct predictor of customer outcomes (see
Figure 1). In such a situation, there appears an ample
scope of testing mediation effects of work engagement,
an expected intermediating variable in the causal
relationships. Thus, the following assumption also
seems to be reasonable:
H4: 
Employees' work engagement mediates the rela-
tionship between service employees' job crafting
and customer outcomes.

RESEARCH GAPS AND RATIONALE
Theliteratureonworkengagementhasmostlyemerged
either from the practitioner literature or consulting
firms and not so much from the academic literature
(Robinson, Perryman, & Hayday, 2004). Similarly,
while complementing the concept of job design, the
term `job crafting' was recently coined by Wrzesniewski
and Dutton (2001) as a bottom-top view of job design.
Therefore, the concept of job crafting is yet to receive
its due attention from scholars in organizational
studies (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Although a
few empirical studies (e.g., Ghitulescu, 2006; Leana et
al., 2009) have been conducted, their focus, neverthe-
less, has been either on education or manufacturing.
Furthermore, these studies are generally found to be
theoretical or qualitative in nature (Tims et al., 2012).
The research around the construct of job crafting is in
its infancy so much so that scholars report a lack of
established scales for measuring job crafting (Tims &
Bakker, 2010; Tims et al., 2012). The lack of scales has
come in the way of making advances in understanding
the concept of job crafting and making additions to this
line of research (Tims et al., 2012). Therefore, realizing
the above gaps, and specifically, responding to the
number of research calls whereby job crafting behav-
iours could be empirically related to various desired
consequences at the employee and organizational
levels (e.g., Tims et al., 2012), the present study seems
to be the need of the hour. Additionally, ascertaining
both the direct and indirect effects of job crafting atti-
tudes on the part of service employee on customer
outcomes would be a step forward in this direction.
This is more so in the Asian region where there is no
published work that links job crafting with perfor-
mance in the service context to the best of the authors'
knowledge and belief.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 283
Following the liberalization of economies, there
has been an increasing trend of multi-national
companies opening business units in the Asian region.
Countless service providers approach the same
customers simultaneously. This has made the job of
Asian corporate to retain their existing customers
in the services sector more challenging. Therefore,
the studies highlighting how service providers can
improve customer experience and the consequent
commitments to their existing service firms are highly
justified. Additionally, the diffusion of the concept of
work engagement and job crafting among the service
managers and highlighting its relevance to services
would be a worthwhile attempt.
METHODOLOGY
To ascertain the connections between service employee
work engagement, job crafting, customer satisfaction
and loyalty, primary data were collected from service
employees and customers of several branches of
four prestigious banks. It included public, private
and foreign banks operating in some of the states in
northern-most parts of the country such as Delhi,
Punjab, J&K and Haryana. A proportionate stratified
sampling procedure was adopted to include all the
possible categories such as rural, semi-rural, urban and
metropolitan in the sample.
Theserviceemployeeswererequestedtoreacttoasurvey
instrument to share their perspective about various
dimensions of job crafting and work engagement. The
customers were requested to reveal their satisfaction
and loyalty again by reacting to a different survey instru-
ment. Each service employee was requested to respond
to one employee survey instrument and collect four
customer survey instruments completed by any four
customers of his/her choice. A common identification
number was allotted to the employee and those of four
customers' survey instruments facilitated the matching
process. The aggregated mean scores of customer
responses were then matched with those of the service
employee as recommended by several researchers in the
past (Schneider & Bowen, 1985). A total of 350 survey
instruments were distributed, out of which, as many as
203 (58%) were found usable and out of 1,000, as many
as 540 (54%) customer survey instruments were received
and found usable for the final analysis. The average
response of the number of customers per employee
was 2.7.
Research Instruments and Scale Purification
Lickert's 5-point scale that offers the scope of ascer-
taining respondents' agreement or disagreement level
(ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree)
with the statements was used. The purification process
here also refers to the deletion of various scale items
that involved using item scale correlations and explor-
atory factor analysis. Items were also deleted when the
factor loading was less than 0.40 or cross-loaded. The
purpose of the purification process among other objec-
tives ensured that all scale items were statistically signif-
icant and all scales showed unidimensionality in terms
of model fit indices and face validity.
To capture the notion of the employees' level of work
engagement, a 17-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale
(UWES) originally developed by Schaufeli et al. (2002)
was used. The scale specifically captured the view of
all the three domains of the work engagement such
as `vigour', `dedication' and `absorption'. The stand-
ardized estimate of its constituent items ranged from
0.43 to 0.87. In order to examine the service employee
job crafting, the 21-item scale originally developed by
Tims et al. (2012) was administered on contact service
employees. All the 21 items provided for a unidimen-
sional scale (x2 = 18.06, df = 5, p = 0.02, RMR = 0.02, GFI
= 0.93, AGFI = 0.95, CFI = 0.92). The factor loadings of
the items of job crafting of service employee consisting
of four dimensions were statistically significant. The
standardized estimates of these items ranged from 0.46
to 0.62 for `increasing structural job resources', 0.55 to
0.76 for `decreasing hindering job demands', 0.55 to
0.68 for `increasing social job resources' and 0.49 to 0.61
for `increasing challenging job demands'.
For measuring customers' loyalty, Dick and Basal's
(1994) loyalty scale was used, which was found to
represent a unidimensional construct (x2 = 18.04, df =
5, p = 0.02, RMR = 0.02, GFI = 0.89, AGFI = 0.96, CFI =
0.97). Its factor loading ranged from 0.54 to 0.79.
Finally, although a nine-item scale for measuring
customer satisfaction was drawn from the work of
Maloles (1997), three items were excluded for their
factor loadings were less than 0.40 and they cross-
loaded. Thus, only six items could be used for the final
examination after the purification process. The purifi-
cation process provided for a unidimensional scale (x2
= 16.43, df = 5, p = 0.01, RMR = 0.01, GFI = 0.94, AGFI =
0.89, CFI = 0.92).
284 WORK ENGAGEMENT AND JOB CRAFTING OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INFLUENCING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The present analysis includes three main steps for
ascertaining the causal relationships between several
constructs. First, the impact of various dimensions
of job crafting of service employees on their work
engagement was measured. Second, the impact
exerted by employee work engagement on customer
outcomes (customer satisfaction and their loyalty) was
measured. Finally, the total effects exerted by several
dimensions of job crafting of service employees either
directly on customer outcomes or indirectly through
employee work engagement were measured with the
help of path analysis. The estimation of both direct
and indirect effects made it possible to measure the

The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) and the adjusted good-

The CFI showed a high value of 0.91. Thus, slightly low
Cronbatch alpha value in a few constructs is not consid-
ered to be a problem with the analysis. Furthermore,
generally the alpha estimates are nearer the cut-off
point (0.70). The factor loadings of the constituent items
are also satisfactory.
Effects of Job Crafting on Service Employee Work
Engagement and Customer Outcomes
Several dimensions of job crafting of service employees
do substantially (38%) exert their influence on service
employee work engagement as reflected by R2 in Table
2. Specifically, increasing social job resources appears
to be the most powerful driver (b = 0.456, p < 0.001) of
employee work engagement among the dimensions
of employee job crafting. The statistics reveal that the
influence is followed by increasing challenging job
demands (b = 0.406, p < 0.001), increasing structural job
resources (b = 0. 393, p < 0.001), and finally, by decreasing
hindering job demands (b = 0. 0.271, p < 0.001). In short,
all the ascertained path coefficients obviously indi-
cate that all the dimensions of employee job crafting
of service employees are effective antecedents of
service employee work engagement. Therefore, ample
evidence is found in support of H1--that the greater
the level of job crafting of service employee, the greater
will be their work engagement. Additionally, the causal
path coefficients indicating the direct influence of work
engagement on customer loyalty (b = 0.463, p < 0.001)
and customer satisfaction (b = 0.554, p < 0.001) fully
support H2--that the greater the service employee work
engagement, the greater will be the customer outcomes.
Although examining the direct effect of customer satis-
faction on customer loyalty was not among the objec-
tives of the study, a path coefficient of 0.561, significant
at < 0.001, well supports the idea that customer satisfac-
tion is a function of customer loyalty.

Direct and Indirect Effects of Job Crafting of
Service Employee on Customer Outcomes
The ascertained direct as well as indirect causal effects
of job crafting dimensions on customer outcomes are
presented in Table 3 and Figure 2.
Direct effects: On comparing the magnitude of
direct effects, it is observable that increasing
social job resources is the most powerful element
of job crafting of service employees that drives
both customer satisfaction (b = 0.488, p < 0.01)
and customer loyalty (b = 0.412, p < 0.01). Both
increasing structural job resources and decreasing
hindering job demands are substantially (around
half of the total effect) and significantly influencing
customer satisfaction. However, increasing struc-
tural job resources appears to be much more influ-
ential (above 80% of the total effect) in the case of
customer loyalty (b = 0.262, p < 0.01). Increasing
challenging job demands exerts a marginal yet
significant direct effect on customer satisfac-
tion (b = 0.064, p < 0.05). Conversely, it influences
customer loyalty, both substantially and signifi-
cantly (b = 0.210, p < 0.05).
Indirect effects: The author has noticed several indi-
rect positive and statistically significant effects
of job crafting dimensions on both the customer
outcomes. For instance, in the case of customer
satisfaction, increasing structural job resources
and decreasing hindering job demands indirectly
contribute around half of the total effect (b = 0.187
and 0.173, respectively, both significant at < 0.01).
Contributing above 86 per cent of the total effect,
increasing challenging job demands appears to be
the most significant indirect driver (b = 0.427, p <
0.05) of customer satisfaction.
In the case of customer loyalty, the indirect effects
get triggered mostly by the increasing challenging
job demands (b = 0.232, p < 0.01) and decreasing
hindering job demands (b = 0.194, p < 0.01), thus
both contributing around half of the total effect indi-
rectly. The indirect effects on customer loyalty are
not so substantial from the other two dimensions of
job crafting of service employees (ranging between
only 11 per cent and 20 per cent of the total effects).
Taken together the overall direct and indirect effects
of several dimensions of job crafting of service on
customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, there is
ample evidence in support of H3--that the greater the
job crafting of service employee, the greater will be
the customer loyalty.
Mediating effects: In the case of customer satisfac-
tion, both the increasing structural job resources and
decreasing hindering job demands exert a substantial
(around half of the total effect) and significant indi-
rect effect, thus suggesting a partial mediating role of
the intermediating variable (work engagement in this
study). Similarly, in the case of customer loyalty, both
increasing challenging job demands and decreasing
hindering job demands exert significant and substan-
tial indirect effects (around half of the total effect) on
customer loyalty, thereby indicating again a partial
mediation of the mediating variable. The impor-
tant observation is the most substantial and signifi-
cant indirect effect (above 86% of the total effect) of
increasing challenging job demands on the customer
satisfaction. This suggests a full mediation of inter-
mediating variables here. However, increasing social
job resources exert only marginal indirect effect
(around 10%) both in the case of customer satisfaction
and customer loyalty, thus suggesting not so signifi-
cant intermediating role of the intermediating vari-
able. Overall, the indirect effects also contribute to a
considerable extent in shaping the desired customer
outcomes in the present analysis and, accordingly, it
is safe to accept H4--that employees' work engage-
ment mediates the relationship between service
employee job crafting and customer outcomes.

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION, AND
IMPLICATIONS
In view of the significance of customer satisfaction and
loyalty with the service firms, the present study was
conducted to highlight the factors that caused these
outcomes. The study also attempted to diffuse the
understanding as to how these factors were related
to the positive customer experiences and their loyalty
to service firms. With the help of both the literature
and the present empirical findings, the study estab-
lishes that job crafting attitude of service employees
result in service employee work engagement and
desired customer outcomes (customer satisfaction and
customer loyalty in the present study). In addition
to the direct positive impact of various employee job
crafting attitudes on work engagement and customer
outcomes, the study also indicates its indirect impact
on customer outcomes through service employee work
engagement. Thus, it also draws our attention towards
the intermediating role of service employee work
engagement in the causal relationship. These causal
relationships among the constructs such as service
employee crafting attitudes, work engagement and
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 287
desired customer outcomes, both in the direct and indi-
rect forms, emphasize the relevance of these constructs
in the service context. Additionally, the present study
shows the construct of job crafting to be as much impor-
tant as had been proved in the non-service context in
the past.
The causal relationships so ascertained in the present
study corroborate the basic philosophy of internal
marketing advocating spillover effects of internal
customer satisfaction on external customer satisfaction
(e.g., George, 1990). This is true insofar as work engage-
ment reflecting the satisfaction of service employee
(internal customers) in this study gets reflected in
customer (external customer) satisfaction and loyalty.
All the predictions are supported by the results. The
four-dimensional job crafting construct explains the
variation of as much as 38 per cent in service employee
work engagement. All the components reflecting
various job crafting attitudes of service employees
are found effective antecedents to both the service
employee work engagement and the desired customer
outcomes. The least substantial yet significant indirect
influence of increasing social job resources contributing
only 9 and 11 per cent of the total effect on customer
satisfaction and customer loyalty, respectively, is the
only causal relationship that does not strongly support
the hypotheses. However, the direct effect of this
crafting attitude is stronger on the customer outcomes,
thereby justifying more attention from practitioners.
In order to improve the customer outcomes as
considered in this study, the management and moni-
toring of the crafting attitude and engagement levels
amongst service employees is one of the significant
implications of this study. Using survey instruments,
managers can measure each dimension of job crafting
and work engagement in their organizations, and they
can accordingly take corrective measures to improve
upon. Management can fix reasonable standards for
job crafting attitudes and work engagement levels to
compare the performance of their employees against
such standards at an individual, divisional or busi-
ness-unit level. The comparison can, in turn, become
the basis for taking decisions related to employee
compensation.
The relevant literature on job crafting suggests that
employees do not only look for but they also seize
whatever possible opportunity they find in their
way to craft their jobs (Berg et al., 2010). Therefore,
service managers must offer all the possible latitude
to their employees to craft their jobs that suit their
requirements, tastes and preferences. Considering
the relevant literature and empirical findings of the
study that highlight the importance of job crafting and
work engagement, service managers need to develop
an understanding of the emerging relevance of these
concepts to their area of management.
The reward system is one of the influential factors that
transform employee attitude from the undesired to the
desired one. As job crafting includes bringing about
desired changes in the relational and task boundaries
of the job, the management can devise a reward system
that encourages desired job crafting and discourages
undesired job crafting. Furthermore, superiors can
design the job itself in a way that encourages employees
to craft their jobs as per the desires of the manage-
ment and in a way that suits the customers' require-
ments. Similarly, desired crafting attitudes should
be given due importance in performance appraisals
to encourage beneficial job crafting in the organiza-
tion. However, care must be taken to see that it finally
results in a job that matches employee tastes, aspira-
tions, experience and interests. The psychological
safety to employees that their efforts may not lead them
to any punitive action or criticism by the management
should also be taken care of. Accessibility and availa-
bility of all required job resources for the desired job
crafting and consequent desired work engagement are
also crucial. Finally, fair treatment to employees, trust
in management and in immediate supervisors, appro-
priate rewards to managers, who encourage crafting
and engagement culture, and adequate autonomy and
feedback to employees are some of the measures advo-
cated by engagement scholars (e.g., Macey et al., 2009).
Job crafting scholars have argued that, although the
concept is very simple in general, job crafting that
proves to be beneficial in attaining organizational
results is not that simple (Berg et al., 2010). Job crafting
that suits employee aspirations but does not bring
desired organizational results can be detrimental.
Therefore, employee education and training to facilitate
beneficial crafting is a prerequisite to reap the benefits
of the crafting. Furthermore, encouraging upward
communication at all levels in the organizations can go
a long way in encouraging job crafting and consequent
work engagement. This is on account of the fact that
job crafting is essentially a bottom-top approach of
job design, where subordinates are to be encouraged
to make alterations in their jobs and voice the same
288 WORK ENGAGEMENT AND JOB CRAFTING OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INFLUENCING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES
informally. Finally, employees may not take active
part in job crafting unless and until they have trust in
the management to feel safe to face any kind of risk
associated with the possible failures in job crafting
(Berg et al., 2010).
Although job crafting is proved to have influence on
employees' positive job attitudes and their performance
in the present study, the arrangement of job resources
as a triggering factor for desired work engagement and
performance is another important implication of the
study. Accordingly, the identification of job resources
specific to retail banking is very critical for improving
its performance. For instance, top officials of the bank
can personally visit branches and sit together with
frontline staff to identify required supervisory support
and aspirations of employees at the branch level.
Recognition and feedback to employees is considered
as significant job resources that facilitate them to work
better and improve upon. In order to ensure their effi-
cacy, service managers should avoid giving nega-
tive feedback to frontline employees in front of their
customers; positive feedback in front of customers can
actually trigger desired employee cooperation and
morale. Appropriate rewards and incentives to rein-
force employees' desired behaviour are other prom-
ising job resources.
Clarity in communication reduces employee role ambi-
guity and develops a clear understanding among
employees as to what is expected of them by both the
management and the customers. Regular staff meetings
representing different layers, departments or divisions
of the branch can provide employees with an ample
opportunity to interact and participate, whereby they
should be encouraged to identify areas of improve-
ment and to make suggestions for the same. This will
also make employees aware about what is happening
in other departments and help them understand how
their role needs to be integrated with the activities
taking place in other divisions.
The knowledge of different banking products and
how to sell them are the basic required skills for bank
employees. These are the technical or motor skills
without which employees cannot perform their jobs
effectively or respond appropriately to customer needs
during service encounters. Therefore, apart from
usual supervisory coaching and training, seminars,
workshops and conferences should be regular features
of banking organizations, whereby customers,
management representatives and frontline employees
can jointly discuss work-related issues to improve the
overall operations in their branches. These training
programmes along with other skills must also aim at
improving employees' interpersonal communication,
listening and cognitive skills, thus enabling them to
understand customers' feeling properly during the
service encounter. Furthermore, better opportunities
for employee growth and advancement can also
motivate employees to improve their knowledge,
skills and abilities. Adequate empowerment is another
job resource without which employees cannot use
their skills effectively. They keep customers waiting
and serve only when they get approval from their
higher ups. Additionally, the proper arrangement of
technology and its maintenance should always be
management's priority both at the headquarter and
branch levels to ensure unflinching technological
support to employees.
Employee growth and opportunity for advancement
is another significant job resource. A well-planned
and spelt-out career-development programme for
employees' growth and advancement gives positive
signals of support and care to the employees. Senior
management in consultation with employee represent-
atives can jointly chalk out such plans and decide about
required qualifications and credentials. Management
should arrange programmes for their counselling in
accordance with these progressive stages to facilitate
their growth.
LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE
RESEARCH
As with any other investigation, the present work
also has some limitations. First, while examining the
consequences of job crafting of service employees,
this study used four dimensions: increasing struc-
tural job resources, decreasing hindering job demands,
increasing social job resources, and increasing chal-
lenging job demands as originally suggested by Tims
et al. (2012). Future research work can adopt different
dimensions of the construct, say, task crafting, rela-
tional crafting and cognitive crafting (Wrzesniewski &
Dutton, 2001). These dimensions are briefly discussed
in the earlier part of this paper. Similarly, while using
the construct of work engagement, the present study
considered dimensions such as vigour, dedication
and absorption in the literature review, administra-
tion of survey instrument and final analysis. However,
the analysis examined the overall effects of work
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 289
engagement rather than ascertaining the effects of these
dimensions separately in the causal relationships.
Second, although the present study highlighted the
significance of job crafting in a service context, it did
not include the factors that played the causal role
in encouraging job crafting of service employees.
Similarly, while examining the consequences of job
crafting of service employees, work engagement was
the only mediating variable used in the causal relation-
ships. Future studies, apart from work engagement,
can also include several other employee job attitudes
such as their service effort level, commitment, organ-
izational citizenship behaviour, satisfaction, esprit de
corps, involvement, innovative work behaviour, etc.
Again customer satisfaction and loyalty were the two
outcome variables in the present causal relationships.
Various other performance measures such as market
share, cost of producing services, customer complaints,
customer service quality perception, adaptability, ROI,
corporate image and service failure recovery can also
be considered.
Third, the author is concerned about the bias that must
have gone into the reaction of customers as the service
employees had to distribute and collect the survey
instruments from their customers themselves. This is
why the mean scores of four customers reflecting the
response were arithmetically averaged to minimize the
possible bias. Investigators in future can personally
distribute and collect the responses from customers to
avoid this kind of error.
Finally, management may find it hard in general
to arrange all the job resources that facilitate both
job crafting attitudes and consequent work engage-
ment on account of the scarcity of these resources.
Consequently, they would be interested to know
specific variables that trigger the employee crafting
attitudes and work engagement that best suit their
specific work environment. Needless to mention, all
the crafting attitudes may not be equally beneficial
across industries, sectors and cultures. Thus, future
research studies that can identify the significance of
various crafting attitudes in relation to varying work
environments and required job resources for the same
may be a valuable contribution. Furthermore, the find-
ings of the present study in general and with refer-
ence to the magnitude of direct and indirect effects in
particular cannot be generalized unless replicated in
other sectors, cultures, and areas.
