Predictability of frailty index and its
components on mortality in older adults
in China
Fang Yang1 and Danan Gu2*
Abstract
Background: Frailty represents an increased vulnerability to external stressors due to decreased physiological
reserve and dysfunction in multiple bodily systems. The relationship between frailty and mortality has been
well-documented in the literature. However, less is known about the predictive powers of frailty index and its
components on mortality when they are simultaneously present. This study aimed to examine the predictive
powers of frailty index and its multiple components on mortality in a nationally representative sample of older
adults in China.
Methods: We used a sample of 13,731 older adults from the 2008/2009 and 2011/2012 waves of the Chinese
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Frailty was measured using the cumulative deficit approach, and
was constructed from 38 health variables (39 deficits). We selected 8 major sets of components: activities of daily
living (ADL) (6 deficits), instrumental ADL (IADL) (8 deficits), functional limitations (5 deficits), overall cognitive
functioning (1 deficit), chronic disease conditions (11 deficits), self-reported health (2 deficits), hearing and vision
impairment (2 deficits), and psychological distress (1 deficit). Survival analysis was used to examine the roles of the
frailty and its components in mortality.
Results: Results showed that almost all the components of the frailty index (except chronic diseases) were significant
predictors of mortality when examined individually. Among the components, ADL and IADL disabilities remained
significant when considering all the components simultaneously. When the frailty and its components were
simultaneously analyzed, the frailty remained a robust predictor of mortality across the age and sex groups, while most
components lost their significance except ADL, IADL, and cognitive function components in some cases.
Conclusions: Frailty measured by cumulative deficits has a stronger predictive power on mortality than its all individual
components. ADL and IADL disability play a greater role in mortality than other components when considering all the
components of frailty.

Background
Frailty has received increasing academic attention in the
field of gerontology and geriatrics in the past 30 years
[1­4]. Frailty represents multifactorial vulnerability to
external stressors due to decreased physiological reserve
and dysregulation in multiple bodily systems [1, 3, 5­8].
Despite the heated discussion on this topic, there is no
consensus regarding the measures of frailty [1, 3, 9].
However, there are two widely used models to measure
frailty: one is the phenotype model and the other is the
health deficit accumulation model. The former assesses
frailty using five specific manifest indicators, including
unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical ac-
tivity, slowness, and weakness [1]. The latter measures
frailty using the proportion of present deficits to all
the possible health deficits in physical, functional, and
psychosocial domains for a given person, or frailty
index [3, 7, 10]. Different from the phenotype model,

frailty index focuses more on the aggregate decline in
psychosocial and physical functioning, and it is a promis-
ing proxy measure for biological aging [5, 6, 9, 11].
Research has demonstrated that frailty is a significant
predictor of a variety of outcomes, such as falls,
hospitalization, health change, and mortality, and the rela-
tionships between frailty and the outcomes are independ-
ent of various confounders and chronological age [5­7,
10, 12­14]. Taking mortality for example, the frailty-
mortality association has been well-established in the lit-
erature. For instance, empirical research has shown that
frailty index predicts mortality in general older populations
and even in centenarians, for both women and men [2, 6,
10, 12], and in older adults from different cultural back-
grounds [6, 9, 12, 15].
Regarding the variables used to construct frailty index,
several criteria have to be met. The variables should cover
a range of health deficits, the prevalence of the overall def-
icits should generally increase with age, and they should
not saturate too early [16]. So far, the following compo-
nents have been commonly used to construct frailty index:
cognitive impairment, chronic illness, disability in activ-
ities of daily living (ADL), disability in instrumental activ-
ities of daily living (IADL), functional limitation, self-rated
health, chronic disease conditions, hearing and vision
losses, and psychological distress [2, 3, 5­7, 12, 13, 16].
Some studies have also included biomarkers in the index
[17, 18]. However, this cumulative deficit approach does
not necessarily require the same number or the same set
of variables for construction of the index because the in-
dexes could yield comparable results as long as the vari-
able list includes the main health domains [4, 16, 19].
One advantage of frailty index is that it incorporates a
variety of health deficits whose individual contributions to
health and mortality risks may be too small to be detect-
able, and a combination of these deficits into a single
index could enhance its explanatory power [10, 20]. How-
ever, some studies have also showed that the significance
of some components clustered in a few major domains of
the frailty index in determining mortality is noticeable.
For instance, Gu found that when excluding eight IADL
disability items from the frailty index list that included 39
frailty items from a nationwide survey in China, the pre-
dictive power of the frailty index from 31 remaining defi-
cits on mortality was reduced, and that it was also the
true for the case where a frailty index was generated from
the randomly selected half of the variables from the list of
thirty-nine items. In all other cases, the reduced predictive
power was small [19]. Theou and colleagues found that
the frailty index including disability and co-morbidity in-
creased its predictive power for mortality than the index ex-
cluding disability and co-morbidity [20]. To the best of our
knowledge, these studies are among the first that provided
empirical evidence about comparisons of relative predictive
power for mortality between the frailty index and its com-
ponents, which have improved our understanding about
the frailty index and its components in predicting subse-
quent mortality at old ages.
However, no studies have systematically examined the
predictive power of the frailty index on mortality compared
to that of its components in the literature. Researchers have
argued that the frailty index is a "macroscopic variable" that
represents general organism damage of an individual rather
than any specific health deficiency [3, 5]. Thus, despite the
well-established relationship between the frailty index and
mortality, it remains largely unknown which component of
the frailty index is significantly associated with mortality
and whether the frailty index still is a significant predictor
of mortality in presence of its components, and vice versa.
The current study aims to address these research gaps.
More specifically, we aim to examine the specific associ-
ation between each component of the frailty index and
mortality, and the association between the frailty index and
mortality in a nationally representative sample of older
adults in mainland China (hereafter China). Despite in-
creasing research on frailty in developed countries, it is
under-studied in developing countries, like China. Examin-
ation on frailty in Chinese older adults could better inform
the eldercare policy-making and interventions.
Methods
Study sample
This study used the 2008/2009 and 2011/2012 waves of
the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey
(CLHLS). The CLHLS was initiated in 1998, and is the
first national longitudinal project to investigate the
determinants of health and longevity of older adults in
China from a multidisciplinary perspective. One signifi-
cant characteristics of the project is that it has the lar-
gest sample of the oldest old so far from a developing
country, which could enable a better understanding of
human healthy longevity. The CLHLS was conducted
through in-home interviews with extensive information
collected in half of the randomly selected cities/counties
in 22 out of 31 provinces in China. The CLHLS aims to
interview all centenarians in the sampled cities/counties.
Age of each centenarian was validated based on various
sources whenever available, including birth certificate,
genealogical documents, household booklet, and ages of
their children and siblings [21]. For each centenarian
interviewee, one nearby octogenarian and one nearby
nonagenarian (living in either a community or an institu-
tion) with pre-designated age and sex were randomly
interviewed; and for every three centenarians, four partici-
pants aged 65­79 (living in either a community or an in-
stitution) were randomly chosen based on a random code
assigned to the centenarian in the same cities/counties
where centenarians were living at the time of survey. Each

respondent provided a written informed consent to indi-
cate his/her willingness to participate in the CLHLS. The
informed consent was signed by the next-of-kin if the re-
spondent was not able to write. The CLHLS has collected
information on demographics, family and household charac-
teristics, health behaviors and lifestyles, economic resources,
self-rated health and life satisfaction, cognitive functioning,
physical examination, activities of daily living and instru-
mental activities of daily living, and chronic illness. More de-
tails about the sampling procedures and data collected can
be found elsewhere [21­23], thus not presented herein.
In the 2008/2009 wave, the total number of participants
was (N = 16,563). The response rate was 98 %. Of the total
participants, 8,286 (50.03 %) were re-interviewed in the
2011/2012 wave, 5,445 (32.87 %) died before the 2011/
2012 follow-up, and the rest of the participants (17.10 %)
were lost to follow-up. A comparison between those lost
to follow-up and those included in the analysis found that
participants who were older, Han-ethnicity, living in the
urban areas, financially independent, or frailer were more
likely to be lost to follow-up in the 2011/2012 wave, and
those who were married and currently smoking were less
likely to be lost to follow-up (results available upon re-
quest). The dates of death for deceased participants were
collected from various informants, such as next of kin, ne-
ighbors, neighborhood committees, and death certificate
whenever available. Systematical assessments for the ac-
curacy of age reporting, the randomness of attrition, the
reliability, validity, and the consistency of numerous mea-
sures of health outcomes and mortality of the CLHLS
were performed and the data quality was high [21­23].
Measurements
Frailty index
In this study, frailty index was measured by the proportion
of the number of health deficits presented to the total num-
ber of possible health deficits for a given person. The score
range of the index was from 0 to 1 in this study, with higher
scores denoting higher level of frailty. The indicator included
39 deficits from a total of 38 indicators encompassing self-
rated health, cognitive functioning, ADL disability, IADL dis-
ability, functional limitations, hearing and vision impair-
ments, chronic disease conditions, serious illness measured
by being hospitalized or bedridden, psychological distress,
and so forth. If an individual experiences more than one ser-
ious illness in the past 2 years, an additional deficit score is
assigned to this person [2, 5, 6]. These indicators are similar
to those used in previous research [2, 6, 10, 15]. Following
the scoring method in the literature [2, 5, 6], each deficit was
coded as 1 when it was present, and 0 when it was absent.
However, as noted below, we did not use the 0 ~ 1 range for
the index in regression models. Instead we used the number
of deficits to measure the level of frailty of a given respond-
ent for the purpose to be consistent with its components.
Components of the frailty index
We have selected following 8 major sets of the components:
cognitive functioning, chronic diseases, ADL disability, IADL
disability, functional limitations, self-rated health, hearing or
vision impairment, and psychological distress, which have
been frequently used in constructing frailty index in the lit-
erature [2, 3, 5­7, 12, 13, 16]. In the CLHLS, cognitive func-
tioning was measured by a Chinese version of the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) with a total score of 30,
and respondents with a score of 23 or lower were considered
as cognitively impaired [21­23]. Chronic diseases were mea-
sured by older adults' self-reports from a list of 11 illnesses
(e.g., diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer).
ADL disability and IADL disability were assessed by whether
a respondent needed any assistance in performing six basic
daily activities (e.g., bathing, dressing) and 8 activities that
are important for independent living (e.g., cooking, shop-
ping), respectively. Functional limitations were measured by
five objective examinations, such as hand behind lower back,
raising arms upright, standing from sitting a chair. Psycho-
logical distress was a single item used in constructing the
frailty index. We defined a respondent to experience psycho-
logical distress if he or she often/always felt fearful/anxious,
lonely/isolated, or useless. Self-rated health was constructed
by two items including current self-assessed global health
and the health status of the respondent compared with one
year ago. Considering cerebrovascular and cardiovascular
diseases are leading cause of mortality in China [24], we also
generated another component by separating stroke and
heart diseases from the rest of chronic diseases and explored
their role in predicting mortality. Thus, in the analyses, there
were nine sets of components in total.
Covariates
Based on previous literature [2, 5, 6, 10], we included the
following covariates to obtain more robust results: age,
ethnicity (Han vs. Non-Han), current urban/rural resi-
dence (urban vs. rural), marital status (currently married
vs. no), education (one or more years of education vs. no
schooling), lifetime primary occupation (white-collar oc-
cupation vs. all other occupations), economic independ-
ence (primary financial source from retirement wages or
work vs. other sources), economic status (family economic
status is rich or very rich in local community vs. others),
co-residence with family members (yes vs. no), and health
behaviors measured by current smoking (yes vs. no) and
regular exercise (yes vs. no). Gender was not included as a
covariate since all the analyses were stratified by sex.
Analytical strategy
First, we presented the sample descriptive statistics by age
groups (ages 65­79, ages 80­89, ages 90­99, ages 100+) and
sex. Second, we examined the predictive powers of the frailty
index and each of its components on mortality by age
Yang and Gu BMC Geriatrics (2016) 16:145 Page 3 of 9
groups and sex. Four regression models were designed.
Model I controlled for age and ethnicity. Model II further
controlled for all the other covariates listed in Table 1. Model
III additionally controlled for all the other frailty compo-
nents. Model IV added the frailty scores into Model II. To
keep consistent with its components and better understand
the association between the frailty and mortality in compari-
son to associations between its components and mortality,
we used the number of cumulative deficits (ranging from 0
to 39), rather than the frailty index (ranging from 0 to 1) to
represent the level of frailty of a given individual.
In the analyses, we used the Weibull hazard regression
models to examine the predictive powers of frailty scores
and its components on mortality. Mortality risk was the
dependent variable of the survival analysis in the study,
which was indicated by survival status and the duration of
exposure to death. The number of days from the date of the
2008/2009 interview to the date of death or the date of the
2011/2012 follow-up interview was used to indicate the
length of survival time. Those who were lost to follow-up in
the 2011/2012 survey were dropped from the hazard
analyses due to their unknown survival status and survival
length, which leaves the total valid sample of 13,731. Previ-
ous research shows that excluding those lost to follow-up in-
troduced little bias in the estimates [6], and our alternative
approach including those lost to follow-up based on a mul-
tiple imputation yielded similar results (not shown). The
multiple imputation assumed that those lost to follow-up
had the same survival status and survival length from 2008/
2009 to 2011/2012 as those who were not lost to follow-up
if individuals in the former group had the same demograph-
ics, socioeconomic status, family/social support, health be-
haviors, and health conditions as those in the latter group.
We also checked the collinearity among components
and the variance inflation factors (VIF) were all less than
2 when all components were presented in the model,
which is below the criterion (VIF > =10) [25], indicating
that the collinearity problem is not a big issue in the
present study. The analyses were stratified by age and
sex due to the well-established evidence on age and sex
differences in frailty and mortality [2, 5, 6, 10, 15]. All
the analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0.

Results
Table 1 presents the sample distributions of the whole
sample and by age and sex. The mean of the frailty index
was 0.26 ( 10.1 deficits), and it increased with age from
0.14 ( 5.5 deficits) in ages 65­79 to 0.41 ( 16.0 defi-
cits) in ages 100+. With respect to the frailty index com-
ponents, almost all the components increased with age,
except for chronic diseases. With respect to the covari-
ates, the majority of respondents were Han-ethnicity
(93.4 %) and coresided with their family members
(83.3 %), 42.5 % of the respondents were male, 36.5 %
lived in the urban areas, and 36.2 % attained 1+ year
education. About 23.5 % of the respondents reported fi-
nancial independence, 13.2 % in a good economic status,
17.7 % current smoking (17.7 %), and 27 % doing regular
exercise. We also observed gender differences, such that
men scored lower on the frailty index and almost all of
its components than women, except for chronic diseases;
that is, men were in better health than women. In
addition, men reported better social economic status,
and had a higher proportion in smoking and doing regu-
lar exercise than women. Figure 1 demonstrates the dis-
tributions of the frailty index and its components by age
and sex.
Table 2 shows the hazard ratios of mortality from
Weibull hazard models for the frailty and its compo-
nents in men. Results (1st column) show that a higher
score of the frailty predicted a higher risk level of
mortality across different age groups in Model I. For
instance, each additional deficit of the frailty increased
the odds of mortality by 5­10 %. In Model II, when
adding other covariates, the mortality hazard ratios
almost had no change. With respect to the frailty index
components, results (columns 2 to 10) show that almost
all the components significantly predicted a higher risk
of mortality in all age groups with exceptions for chronic
diseases and heart diseases or stroke in Model I. For
example, each additional deficit in ADL disability, IADL
disability, functional limitations, self-rated poor health,
and hearing and vision impairment increased the odds
of mortality by 14­47, 13­22, 14­34, 32­41, and 21­
61 %, respectively. In Model II, these significant hazard
ratios were only slightly reduced when controlling for
other covariates. In Model III, ADL disability and IADL
disability remained significant when adding all the other
components of the frailty index, while other components
turned to be non-significant. In Model IV, when the
frailty was added into Model II (i.e., for each component
Fig. 1 Mean of the frailty index and average deficits of its components by age and sex
Yang and Gu BMC Geriatrics (2016) 16:145 Page 5 of 9
model), the frailty remained significant across different
age groups in all 9 sets of analyses for each of 9 compo-
nents, whereas only the ADL disability and IADL disability
components were significant for certain age groups. In a
few cases (ages 80­89, 90­99), chronic diseases were nega-
tively associated with mortality.
Table 3 shows the hazard ratios of mortality from Weibull
hazard models for the frailty and its components in women,
with similar results as for men in Table 2. However, Table 3
shows that there were stronger links between ADL disabil-
ity and cognitive impairment and mortality in women as
compared to those in men (see Models III and IV).
Discussion
Frailty is an important concept in aging research and prac-
tice, and it is a robust predictor of various health outcomes.
However, less is known about the effects of the frailty index
and its components on mortality among different older age
groups, especially in developing countries. This study ex-
tended previous research and compared the predictive
powers of the frailty index and its components on mortality
in a nationally representative sample among different older
age groups in China where mortality is relatively high and
less resources are available to improve health for elderly
population.
With respect to the predictive powers of frailty index
components on mortality, we found that most compo-
nents (except for chronic diseases) significantly pre-
dicted mortality when considered individually. These
findings are consistent with previous studies [26­33].
The possible reasons for the non-significant role of
chronic diseases might be the underreport of the chronic
diseases, especially in rural areas of China, mainly due to
underdeveloped local health service system or older
adults' poor health literacy [23]. Another possible reason
is that we did not consider the severity of chronic dis-
eases, which is also an important factor for mortality
[34]. Considering cerebrovacular and cardiovascular dis-
eases are leading causes of death in China [24], we ex-
amined the role of heart diseases or stroke in mortality,

and the results were similar to those of chronic diseases
covering a wider range of illnesses. Future research is
warranted to shed light on this issue with more informa-
tion on chronic diseases.
When considering all the components simultaneously,
only ADL disability and IADL disability remained sig-
nificant for both men and women, and cognitive im-
pairment remained significant for women, whereas
other components were not significant. These findings
suggest that cognitive impairment (only for women),
ADL and IADL disability (for both men and women)
could partially explain the effects of other components
on mortality. In other words, other components play a
trivial role in determining mortality and will lose their
predictivity when they are studied simultaneously with
these three components. The greater predictive power
of ADL and IADL disabilities on mortality compared to
other index components is in line with previous find-
ings [19, 20]. It is possible that ADL and IADL disabil-
ities play a more important role in mortality, and may
override the effects of other components, leading to
non-significance of other components [28]. Previous
research shows that other components (except self-
rated health) will likely cause ADL and IADL disabil-
ities, which makes ADL and IADL disabilities be more
proximal predictors to mortality [27, 35]. These findings
suggest that some components may play a trivial role
and lose its contribution to mortality when studied
simultaneously. The significant role of cognitive im-
pairment in predicting mortality in women indicates
cognitive impairment is more lethal to women than to
men in relation to mortality. Literature has shown that
women tend to have a higher prevalence of cognitive
impairment, disability, and chronic disease condition,
depression, yet low mortality risk [36], which may
cause a greater association between cognitive impair-
ment and mortality in women than in men. Our finding
is consistent with a recent study that found a greater attri-
bution of cognitive impairment to mortality in women
than in men [37].

In addition to the examinations on frailty index com-
ponents, this study also shows that the frailty index
remained a significant predictor of mortality across the
age and sex groups when examining the frailty index
only, which corroborates previous studies [2, 5­7, 10,
12­15]. We took a step further in the present study and
compared the relative predictive powers of the frailty
index and each of its components on mortality. We
found that the frailty index remained a robust predictor
of mortality, whereas the effects of its components were
less consistent. These results provided strong empirical
evidence for the argument that frailty is more powerful
in predicting mortality than its individual components
[19, 20]. This also highlights the importance of using the
frailty index by accumulating different components into
a single index when examining the relationship between
physical health and mortality [10].
Surprisingly, chronic diseases were found to be a pro-
tective factor for mortality in both men and women when
the frailty index and covariates were simultaneously con-
trolled for. One possible reason might be due to the afore-
mentioned underreport of the chronic diseases in older
adults. Another speculation is that most people who
reported to have chronic diseases got treated. Further-
more, older adults may change their unhealthy behaviors,
or receive more social support and care from their family
members when they were in illness, which might re-
duce the adverse impact of chronic diseases on mortal-
ity [38, 39]. One study using data from a small local
area in China obtained a similar association between
chronic disease conditions and mortality [37].
While stressing the advantages of the present research,
its several limitations should be taken into account in
interpreting the results. First, about 17 % of the partici-
pants interviewed in 2008/2009 were lost to follow-up in
the 2011/2012 wave. Although the loss to follow-up is
not at random, an alternative analysis that included
those lost to follow-up did not alter the conclusion.
Thus, our analysis would not bring a substantial bias in
the conclusion. Second, similar to other surveys on older
adults, there was a proportion of missing values due to
increased age and declined cognitive abilities, proxies
were used to reduce non-response, which might intro-
duce biases when there was inconsistency between proxy
ratings and those of the actual ratings of the partici-
pants. Further research is clearly warranted to shed light
on this issue. Third, the present study assumed that the
associations between each component and mortality and
between the frailty index and mortality were linear.
However, it is likely that the associations could be non-
linear, which deserves more research.
Our study also identifies some future research direc-
tions. For instance, this study only included variables in
physical, functional, and psychosocial domains, but not
biological or genetic domains. Recent research shows
that biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha) are poten-
tial physiological indicators of frailty [17, 18, 40]. It
would be interesting to examine the relative predictive
power of the biomarkers and frailty index on mortality.
In addition, given that ADL and IADL disabilities seem
to play a greater role in mortality compared to other
components, the current construction of the frailty
index approach that assumes equal weight for each
deficit may deserve more research.
Conclusions
Among the various components of the frailty index, ADL
and IADL disabilities are stronger predictors of mortality
than other components. Compared to its components, the
collectively constructed frailty index is a universally con-
sistent and robust predictor of mortality across the age
and sex groups, whereas the effects of its components are
less consistent and less robust. The findings provide
empirical evidence that frailty index that accumulates
mild-effect deficits of each component whose individual
contribution to mortality might be too small, is a promis-
ing measure for global health of older adults.
