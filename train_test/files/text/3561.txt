The relationship between discrimination and stress has
been well established (e.g. Clark et al., 1999; Pascoe and
Smart Richmond, 2009). Experiences of social discrimina-
tion have been associated with numerous deleterious health
outcomes, including heightened activity of the hypothala-
mus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), poorer cardiovascular
functioning (Pascoe and Smart Richman, 2009), and poorer
physical health outcomes (e.g. Clark et al., 1999; Coogan
et al., 2014). Moreover, the physical symptoms linked to
discrimination have been characterized as chronic stress
(Clark et al., 1999). These findings have led to the hypoth-
esis that chronic discrimination experiences can produce a
sufficient level of chronic physiological stress in individu-
als to produce changes in the HPAA and health outcomes
(Williams and Mohammed, 2009).
Discrimination has been established as a chronic stressor
and influential on alterations in HPAAfunctioning, although
not all findings are consistent; inconsistencies can be found
depending on the cortisol measurement and the severity of
the stressor. For example, in a meta-analysis by Miller et al.
(2007), great variability was found in cortisol reactivity,
depending on the timing of the cortisol assessment or the
individual's appraisal. Broadly, it was found that acute
stressors may be associated with HPAA hyper-reactivity,
whereas chronic stressors may be associated with HPAA
hypo-reactivity, particularly when responsiveness is
assessed at later time points. Yet inconsistencies remain in
the literature, given the variability discussed above and the
matrix for cortisol, that is, whether sampling saliva, urine, or
blood (e.g. Yehuda et al., 2003).
When assessing the influence of discrimination or rac-
ism on HPAA functioning, several studies which examined
diurnal profiles with salivary cortisol have found that
African-Americans revealed flatter diurnal cortisol as com-
pared to White participants (e.g. Hajat et al., 2010; Martin
et al., 2012; Skinner et al., 2011). Flatter diurnal profiles are
suggestive of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dys-
regulation, which has been associated with poor health out-
comes (e.g. Skinner et al., 2011). In addition, Kaholokula
et al. (2012) found for Native Hawaiians that morning and
evening salivary cortisol samples were lower for those
reporting higher versus lower attributed racism. While the

Abstract
Discrimination has been associated with elevated cortisol as measured in saliva, blood, and urine. This study investigated
the association between lifetime discrimination and hair cortisol concentrations, considered a measure of chronic stress.
We recruited 180 young adults from diverse backgrounds. Participant responses to lifetime discrimination, home stress,
and subjective status measures were recorded. Lifetime discrimination significantly predicted hair cortisol concentrations,
supporting past research that discrimination experiences impact neuroendocrine systems. To our knowledge, these
are the first findings associating hair cortisol concentrations with discrimination and supports prior evidence positing
discrimination as a chronic stressor that serves as a risk factor for chronic disease.

association between hypocortisolism and chronic stress is
well established (for review, see Heim et al., 2000), not all
studies have found this hypo-responsivity when measuring
HPAA activity.
For example, Zeiders et al. (2012) investigated discrimi-
nation-related stress in a sample of Mexican-American ado-
lescents. Using salivary cortisol assessments to measure
diurnal and awakening responses, they found that perceived
discrimination was associated with greater overall cortisol
output (area under the curve (AUC) and a nearly significant
increase in the cortisol-awakening response (CAR) (p < .08).
In another study of adolescents, Huynh et al. (2016) found
that greater everyday discrimination was associated with
greater daily cortisol (AUC). These associations were not
significantly different by race or sex of participants.
Hair cortisol
Despite the vast amount of work on discrimination and
HPAA reactivity and alterations, little work has yet investi-
gated the potential association of hair cortisol concentra-
tions (HCC) with this well-known chronic stressor: social
discrimination. We used HCC as a biomarker of the cumu-
lative secretion of cortisol into circulation over a 3-month
period, which is now a well-established measure of HPAA
activity. This methodological approach offers many advan-
tages over measurement of cortisol in other sample matri-
ces (for reviews, see Meyer and Novak, 2012; Russell et al.,
2012; Wosu et al., 2013). Hair collection is simple and non-
invasive, and samples can be collected in field or lab set-
tings and stored in envelopes or vials until assayed (e.g. see
O'Brien et al., 2013; Steudte et al., 2011). This avoids the
necessity of storing samples refrigerated or frozen, which is
particularly relevant given that the temporal distance from
the stressor can be an important factor in quantifying the
effects of chronic stress on HPAA activity (Miller et al.,
2007). Moreover, cortisol assessments using blood, sali-
vary, or urinary samples have shown a high degree of intra-
individual variability. In contrast, recent studies found
HCC to be relatively stable with high test­retest associa-
tions when samples were obtained two times over 1 year
and three times over 2 months; test­retest associations
resulted in rs between .68 and .79 (Stalder et al., 2012).
HCC measurement additionally holds promise as a nonin-
vasive measure that is feasible to use with large sample
populations. Indeed, current application of the HCC meth-
odology is a response to the call in the literature that multi-
ple approaches are needed to get a full picture on the
relationship between discrimination and its influence on
stress systems (Juster et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is a
rapidly progressing literature to explicate the neuroendo-
crine mechanisms underlying social stress and disease con-
nections (for review, see Wosu et al., 2013).
Several studies have examined the relationship between
HCC and other long-term measures of cortisol secretion
(for review see Russell et al., 2012). Specifically, positive
correlations have been found between HCC and measures
of diurnal HPA activity. For example, D'Anna-Hernandez
et al. (2011) found HCC and diurnal salivary cortisol area
under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) were cor-
related throughout pregnancy. In earlier work, Suave et al.
(2007) found positive correlations between HCC, serum,
and 24-hour urine cortisol measurements. These findings
have helped validate HCC as a useful biomarker of chronic
cortisol secretion.
Perceived discrimination and
subjective stress
This study used an established scale of lifetime discrimina-
tion to assess the relationship to HCC. The lifetime dis-
crimination measure asks questions on structural perceived
discrimination, perhaps where one's greater socioeconomic
status (SES) upward mobility may have been curtailed
(McNeilly et al., 1996; Williams, 1999). Additionally,
established perceived stress scales were used to examine
relationships with both discrimination and HCC, including
personal perceived stress and home stress. Associations
between perceived stress measures and HCC have been
inconsistent in the HCC-related literature (see Wosu et al.,
2013 for review).
Subjective social status
The subjective social status (SSS) ladder (Operario et al.,
2004) has been used extensively to assess perceived social
standing or status, as compared to objective measures (e.g.
income). Evidence has shown that SSS is associated with
psychosocial factors and devaluation experiences more than
objective SES measures (e.g. Subramanyam et al., 2013).
SSS has also been found to be inversely related to physical
health outcomes such as resting heart rate, obesity, and
hypertension (Singh-Manoux et al., 2005), after statistically
controlling for objective SES measures. Moreover, Adler
et al. (2008), comparing the Whitehall II and Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) data,
found that higher objective SES may not confer the same
benefits to African-Americans as compared to other racial/
ethnic groups, suggesting that implicit negative biases may
still be operating in higher SES environments and that rac-
ism may influence the self-assessment of status.
Given that discrimination engages social devaluation
and subjective status, we hypothesized that SSS would
also moderate the relationships between discrimination
and the stress indicators such that higher status may not
confer the same benefit to high SES minorities reporting
high discrimination.
While the health-gradient literature shows stepwise
health improvements with objective measures of SES, life
course or generational improvements in social status are
O'Brien et al. 3
not always accompanied by a parallel change in health out-
comes or decreased stress (e.g. Colen et al., 2006; O'Brien
et al., 2013), which raises questions about interactive
effects arising from perceived status. In prior work with a
diverse urban population, we found that higher SES con-
ferred protection from both perceived stress and increased
HCC among non-minorities but not among minorities
(O'Brien et al., 2013). We conjectured that differences in
discrimination could account for the minority group differ-
ence at the higher SES level.
This study was guided by the primary hypothesis that
lifetime discrimination stress would be associated with
chronically elevated HCC in a diverse sample. Given that
temporal differences between HCC and shorter-term meas-
ures of cortisol can differ by days and months, lifelong
experiences with adversity may be captured better with the
longer-term measure of HCC. We predicted that a unique
pattern would emerge in which reported lifetime discrimina-
tion would be a better predictor of elevated HCC than per-
ceived stress. Finally, we investigated a potential moderator
of the predicted discrimination-HCC association: subjective
social status (i.e. the SSS ladder; Operario et al., 2004).
This study
This study was guided by the primary hypothesis that life-
time discrimination stress would be associated with chroni-
cally elevated HCC in a diverse sample. Given that hair
cortisol is arguably a better index of chronic HPAA activa-
tion than shorter-term measures such as salivary cortisol,
lifelong experiences with adversity may be captured better
using HCC. Finally, we investigated a potential moderator
of the predicted discrimination-HCC association: subjec-
tive social status (i.e. the SSS ladder; Operario et al., 2004).
To summarize the two major study goals: (1) Do lifetime
discrimination experiences predict (a) elevated HPAA
activity as measured by HCC and (b) perceived stress indi-
cators and (2) Are the relationships between lifetime dis-
crimination and HCC moderated by the SSS ladder.
Method
Participants and recruitment
The protocol was approved by the University of
Massachusetts Boston (UMB) Institutional Review Board
prior to recruitment. We recruited healthy adults from the
UMB, an urban commuter campus, and through online com-
munity bulletin boards. The final sample included 180
adults, ages 18­30; M = 22.20, SD = 3.44, 52 percent female,
race/ethnicity included 19.1 percent African-American/
Black, 29.5 percent Asian, 18.6 percent Latin/Hispanic, and
32.8 percent European/White. All participants provided
written informed consent and were paid an honorarium of
US$25.00 for their participation.
Measures
Hair cortisol.Noting the scalp end, hair samples were
trimmed to 3 cm, weighed, and stored in standard polypro-
pylene test tubes at room temperature until assayed. Since
hair grows approximately 1 cm per month, 3 cm is posited
to capture retrospectively circulating cortisol for the past 3
months. Hair samples weighing 21­195 mg were processed
and analyzed for cortisol (as described in Meyer et al.,
2012). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were
< 10 percent. Values were converted into pg/mg hair for
data analysis and presentation.
Lifetime discrimination. This 12-item scale assesses the life-
time frequency of discrimination experiences across multi-
ple domains including work, school, receiving services,
and public life (adapted by adding one question referring
to higher education advising, McNeilly et al., 1996; Wil-
liams et al., 2009). For example, "How many times in your
life were you discouraged by a teacher or advisor from
seeking higher education?" Respondents answer on a Lik-
ert scale from 0 to 4, where each anchor represents 1­2
instances. Respondents answered using similar anchors as
above and the same open item question. The possible range
is 0­48 ( = .93). For the following measures, items were
reverse scored such that higher total values reflect higher
endorsement of the construct assessed. One additional
item was open and asked "Why" the participant felt that
they were discriminated (e.g. race/ethnicity, sex, weight,
nativity, sexual orientation, or other as an open-ended
response).
Personal perceived stress.The personal perceived stress
(PSS) is a standard validated subjective stress measure,
which includes 10 items (Cohen and Williamson, 1988).
The wording was modified to assess perceived stress over
the past 3 months. Respondents answer on a Likert scale
from 1 to 5, where 1 = never and 5 = very often. The pos-
sible range is 10­50 ( = .88).
Confusion, Hubbub, and Order.This reliable and validated
15-item measure assesses chaos/order of the home environ-
ment (Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS),
Matheny et al., 1995). For example, "You can't hear your-
self think in our home." Respondents answer on a Likert
scale from 1 to 4, where 1 = strongly agree and 4 = strongly
disagree. The possible range is 15­60 ( = .89).
Status measures
SSS.The SSS ladder was administered (Operario et al.,
2004). Specifically, participants were presented an image
of a ladder of 10 rungs and were asked to rate themselves in
4 Health Psychology Open 
terms of their social standing in the community, where 1 is
the lowest and 10 is the highest rank.
Socio-demographic
Age and sex. Participants listed their age in years and their
sex.
Personal income.
Personal income was obtained with
the following scales: income: 1 = <US$5000.00, 2 = US
$5000.00­9000.00, 3 = US$10,000.00­19,000.00, 4 = US
$20,000.00­49,000.00, 5 = US$50,000.00­99,000.00, and 6
= US$100,000.00 and above. None of the respondents
reported income greater than US$49,000.00, thus per-
sonal income was recoded into four categories where 1 =
<US$5000.00, 2 = US$5000.00­9000.00, 3 = US$10,000.00­
19,000.00, and 4 = US$20,000.00­49,000.00 (M = 1.9,
SD = 1.09).
Race/ethnicity. Participants were selected from 13 race/eth-
nic categories, which were recoded into four major ethno/
heritage groups: African (African-American/Black,
Dominican, Haitian), Asian (Asian, Indian, Hawaiian,
Pacific Islander), European (European/White, Arab/Middle
Eastern), and Hispanic (Latino-Hispanic, Caribbean, Bra-
zilian/Portuguese, Native-American), and other as an open
response. Four race/ethnicity categories were constructed
based on respondent's selection of personal heritage group:
African, Asian, Latin-Hispanic, and European-American.
Hair treatment
Six questions assessed the frequencies of hair washing and
styling treatments that may influence cortisol capture in the
hair matrix. These include the frequency of washing, dye-
ing, and chemical treatments.
Medications
Six questions were asked about medications that poten-
tially alter HPAA activity (e.g. corticosteroids, beta-block-
ers), as well as depression, anxiety, and hormones (e.g.
birth control).
Procedure
After obtaining written informed consent, the gloved exper-
imenter clipped a 3-cm sample of hair from the posterior
vertex for the HCC assay. Human hair grows approximately
1 cm per month; therefore, the collection of 3 cm is posited
to capture cortisol secretion retrospectively for the past 3
months. Participants then completed the socio-demographic
and perceived stress and discrimination surveys online via
PsychData (State College, PA). Upon completion of sur-
veys, participants were debriefed, paid, and thanked.
Results
Data analyses
Initial examination of the data revealed that HCC values
(pg/mg) fell within a range that is consistent with hair cor-
tisol findings from both clinical and non-clinical popula-
tions (i.e. range: 3.10­99.00 pg/mg, M = 16.83, SD =
19.16). However, assessment of normality by means of the
Shapiro­Wilk and Kolmogorov­Smirnov tests showed that
the distribution was positively skewed; consequently, the
data were subjected to log-transformation for further analy-
sis (transformed range: .49­2.02, M = 1.07, SD = 0.33). The
frequencies of hair washing, dyeing, use of weave, or
chemical treatments were singularly entered as covariates
in the first step of HCC analyses. There were no significant
differences in hair treatment or medication use on HCC lev-
els (all ps n.s.) and, therefore, these were not included as
covariates in the remaining statistical models. Table 1
shows the zero-order correlations, means, and standard
deviations of major variables.
Analytic plan
Using IBM's SPSS version 19 statistical software, hierar-
chical linear regression modeling was used to assess
whether the dependent variables were predicted by per-
ceived discrimination experiences. Dependent measures
included HCC and perceived stress. Independent variables
included lifetime discrimination and the SSS ladder.
Simple and moderation effects of subjective status were
assessed by the following. In step 1, primary predictors
were entered, in step 2, the moderator variable was entered,
and in step 3, interaction terms were entered. Independent
variables were centered prior to creating the interaction
term to control for multicollinearity (Aiken and West, 1991;
Baron and Kenney, 1986; Cohen et al., 2013). Models
assessed covariates by entering them simultaneously in step
1. Moderation effects were examined using standard proce-
dures outlined in Aiken and West (1991) and Baron and
Kenney (1986). Specifically, significant two-way interac-
tions were probed via regression analyses that included a
conditional moderator variable. Regression lines were then
plotted based on the regression equations. Analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine simple and
interaction effects of race/ethnicity by discrimination on
the dependent measures.
Lifetime discrimination and social status
The first model produced a significant main effect of life-
time discrimination on HCC, after controlling for age and
sex (B = .26, t(1, 171) = 2.21, p < .01, R2
= .03*; Figure 1).
There was no main effect of SSS and the interaction was
n.s. In the next model, perceived stress was not predicted
by lifetime discrimination, status, or the interaction term.
O'Brien et al. 5
In the next model, lifetime discrimination predicted the
home CHAOS measure (B = .458, t(1, 178) = 2.63, p < .01,
R2 = .12**). There was also a main effect of social status
ladder (B = -.173, t(1, 158) = 2.20, p < .05, R2 = .11*), but
the interaction term was not significant (Figure 2).
An ANCOVA assessed the interaction between race/eth-
nicity (4) by lifetime discrimination on HCC and perceived
stress measures. There were no main effects, and the inter-
action of race/ethnicity by lifetime discrimination was not
significant for any other dependent measures, controlling
for sex and age.
Finally, an omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) found
a trend, but no significant between-group differences in life-
time discrimination by race/ethnicity (p = .80). The preva-
lence of lifetime discrimination experiences by race/ethnicity
is presented in Table 2. Responses to the open-ended ques-
tions about the perceived reason "Why were you treated this
way?" for discrimination varied tremendously and included
race, sex, age, looks, and other attributions, but no clear pat-
tern emerged.
Discussion
The results reported in this study support the primary
hypothesis: discrimination experiences can lead to chroni-
cally elevated cortisol in healthy young adults. This rela-
tionship was found using HCC as a biomarker of chronic or
repeated HPA activity and a self-reported measure of dis-
crimination experience in a diverse sample in terms of race/
ethnicity and social class. The findings provide the first evi-
dence of a positive association between frequency of self-
reported lifetime discrimination experience and HCC. It is
notable that this association was not found for a daily dis-
crimination scale (Kessler et al., 1999), that was also
administered (data not shown), but only for the more cumu-
lative and chronic experiences of discrimination. It would
be of interest to replicate this finding as well as examine
HCC and other acute or short-term assessments of social
devaluation, such as microaggressions (e.g. Torres-Harding
et al., 2012). In addition, it would be of interest to examine
the relationship between cumulative concentrations of cor-
tisol in hair with the disrupted diurnal dynamics of cortisol
secretion reported in association with perceived discrimi-
nation in several recent studies (e.g. Thayer and Kuzawa,
2015).
Measurement of HCC is a compelling noninvasive
approach for the physiological assessment of chronic stress,
and the extant research using HCC is expanding rapidly
(for reviews, see Meyer and Novak, 2012; Russell et al.,
2012). The findings in this report indicate that it can also be
a useful tool for teasing out the additive and interactive
effects of the multiple social stressors found in health dis-
parity populations and thought to be consequential for more
frequent or earlier onset of various chronic diseases. The
now considerable literature has established HCC as a sta-
ble, reliable, and efficiently obtained biomarker of average
circulating cortisol over months. It can be obtained in a

6 Health Psychology Open 
single sample collected noninvasively that takes no more
than a few minutes to obtain, has few specific storage needs
(e.g. can be stored in tin foil in a plastic bag), and can be
repeated over time with methodological ease. These fea-
tures suit it well to further research aimed to understand
interrelations among chronic physiological stress, discrimi-
nation, and other pervasive social stressors, neurobehavio-
ral pathways, and health outcomes.
The linkage between HCC and discrimination stress
found in this study provides further evidence to the broad
literature that has evinced physiological mechanisms under-
lying the discrimination and poor health link. Perceived dis-
crimination has been associated in prior research with
poorer cardiovascular, mental, and health outcomes (e.g.
Clark et al., 1999; Coogan et al., 2014; Williams et al.,
2008), and this has not always been race-based discrimina-
tion (Smart Richman et al., 2009).
In this study, race/ethnicity did not interact with per-
ceived discrimination or subjective status to predict HCC
or subjective stress and perceived lifetime discrimination
was reported by participants in all four of the major racial/
ethnic groups (Table 2). The lack of interaction effects may
be due to the diversity of the sample in both race/ethnicity
and SES. For example, the present sample includes a
relatively low SES sample, with the lowest reported income
was <US$5000.00, the highest reported income was
approximately US$49,000.00, which is lower than both US
and Massachusetts median incomes. The sample was also
50 percent students who also work part-time or full time.
However, there was evidence of differences in the perva-
siveness of discrimination across these race/ethnic groups;
African-Americans reported the highest levels of lifetime
discrimination experiences (Table 2). Given the diversity of
this sample, in this first iteration investigating discrimina-
tion and HCC, we did not primarily predict that discrimina-
tion would always be race based. The open-ended questions
revealed enormous variability in "Why" participants felt
discrimination; race was often reported with gender, sexual
orientation, or age. Other responses were ambiguous and
included "class," "not enough," and "religion." In future
studies, the open-ended response could be constrained to
disambiguate the reasons for perceived discrimination.
The complex pattern of social stress and status relation-
ships reported in the literature led us to examine protective
factors for the impact of lifetime discrimination stress on
outcome measures. We hypothesized that social status
would have moderating effects, and this was confirmed
with the chaos variable (i.e. higher status was associated
Figure 2. The left figure shows the mean of lifetime discrimination (+/- the mean) on Chaos in the home scale. Those highest in
reported discrimination also reported the highest Chaos, compared to those in the lowest group. The right figure shows the mean
of subjective status (+/- the mean) on Chaos. Those in the lowest report subjective status also reported the lowest, compared to
those reporting high status.

with lower chaos in the home). It is important for under-
standing the complex interplay of these social variables and
for guiding the selection of interventions that the moderator
hypotheses were supported. In addition, higher discrimina-
tion was predictive of higher chaos, perhaps highlighting
pathways of stress experiences that can infuse other domains.
Questions for future research include other protective
factors that can be assessed experimentally and titrated to
specific discrimination stress, in order to specify the mod-
erator's strengths and contextual constraints. The real world
significance of this work supports the categorization of dis-
crimination as chronic stress.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that warrant discussion.
First, our sample includes a relatively young sample of
diverse adults, ages between 18 and 30 years, and does not
include long-term health outcomes or assessments of acute
or chronic diseases. While we can merely assess discrimi-
nation­stress relationship as a potential risk for deleterious
health later in life, this study focused primarily on one fac-
tor of risk: elevated cortisol secretions in hair, which may
be prospective. Future studies could add measures specifi-
cally associated with allostatic load and actual health out-
comes (e.g. chronic diseases) for a more complete picture.
Furthermore, we did not examine objective SES (income)
as a predictor or moderator, so these findings are independ-
ent of income in this sample. Future samples could recruit
greater variability in SES.
The coding of race/ethnicity was based on participant's
selection of 13 groups as suggested by National Institutes
of Health (NIH). Based on these reports, the race category
was constructed into four groups based on respondent's
answer to one question (primary heritage group; NIH,
2017). Given a larger sample size, with a more focused
recruitment on specific race/ethnicity and variability in
SES, one could investigate differences between related her-
itage groups that also have vast cultural differences, as well
as class, status, and discrimination experiences in the
United States. For example, Vietnamese and Japanese indi-
viduals could be examined as separate groups, rather than
together as Asian.
Finally, there are limits related to HCC that need to be
considered (Meyer and Novak, 2012). Most importantly,
measurement of hair cortisol does not capture details about
the dynamics of physiological stress response systems,
such as extent and timing of the rise and recovery of corti-
sol secretion during a stress response or diurnal patterning
of HPA activity, which feed into the cumulated cortisol
sum. These stress-related dynamics have downstream
effects on cardiovascular and other homeostatic systems,
which can result in "wear and tear" on the systems over
time (Wosu et al., 2013). Because of the limitations of the
hair cortisol approach, we do not yet know whether the
elevated HCC levels found in this study reflect higher base-
line cortisol levels or increased responsiveness to daily
stressful experiences (including those that are discrimina-
tion related). For this reason, further research is needed to
define more completely the nature of HPAA dysregulation
in people who have suffered high levels of lifetime social
discrimination.
Conclusion
The present findings add to the body of evidence indicat-
ing that discrimination is a chronic stressor influential
enough to alter the HPA axis and related stress systems,
potentially increasing the growing gap in health dispari-
ties. Moreover, these findings inform clinical intervention
and social policy in that both discrimination and modera-
tors of these specific stress effects need to be taken into
account in interventions designed to reduce health dispari-
ties in racial and ethnic minorities and other devalued
groups who report discrimination.
