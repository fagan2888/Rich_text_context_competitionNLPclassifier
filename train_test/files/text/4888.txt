Introduction
Although many researchers have investigated stock market
performance after U.S. presidential elections, few studies
have investigated the connection between elections and pre-
ceding stock market performance. When they have, the data
were usually limited to the election-year performance of the
market and only a subset of elections (Biewald, 2003; Chan
& Jordan, 2004; Gleisner, 1992). In this article, we examine
the net percentage change in the stock market in the years
preceding all American presidential reelection bids. For this
study, "reelection" is an election featuring an incumbent
president, whether or not he initially obtained office via an
election.
We find a significant positive relationship between the
stock market's net percentage change during the 3 years prior
to a reelection bid and the incumbent's popular vote-margin
percentage. The net percentage change in the stock market for
1-, 2- and 4-year periods preceding the election is each a
weaker yet significant predictor of reelection outcomes. Our
results are robust to multiple variations in the elements of the
testing procedure: measures of the stock market's perfor-
mance, measures of election outcomes, statistical methods
used to gauge the relationship between the two, durations of
data, and the presence of additional variables. The relationship
does not extend to the incumbent party's candidate when the
incumbent does not run. We find that relationships between
the incumbent's popular vote-margin percentage and the pre-
ceding net percentage change in gross domestic product
(GDP), the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are often
insignificant and always weaker than those between the
incumbent's popular vote margin and net percentage change in
the stock market.
Our results contribute to the literature by elucidating the
relative value of stock indexes for election forecasting mod-
els, challenging economic voting hypotheses, exploring an
underlying motivator of financial and political choice, sug-
gesting a strategy for political party officials and candidates,
and offering ideas for future research. At the theoretical
level, our findings are consistent with Prechter's (1979,

Social Mood, Stock Market Performance,
and U.S. Presidential Elections:
A Socionomic Perspective on
Voting Results

Abstract
We analyze all U.S. presidential election bids.We find a positive, significant relationship between the incumbent's vote margin
and the prior net percentage change in the stock market.This relationship does not extend to the incumbent's party when
the incumbent does not run for reelection.We find no significant relationships between the incumbent's vote margin and
inflation or unemployment. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a significant predictor of the incumbent's popular vote margin
in simple regression but is rendered insignificant when combined with the stock market in multiple regression. Hypotheses
of economic voting fail to account for the findings.The results are consistent with socionomic voting theory, which includes
the hypotheses that (a) social mood as reflected by the stock market is a more powerful regulator of reelection outcomes
than economic variables such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment; and (b) voters unconsciously credit or blame the leader
for their mood.

unconsciously credit or blame the leader for their mood.
EconomicVoting
Many political scientists hypothesize that changes in eco-
nomic variables cause changes in other social variables such
as stock market trends, public mood, and voting results (e.g.,
Fair, 1996, p. 132). A number of researchers have character-
ized the relationship between voters and their elected offi-
cials in terms of two types of variables: popularity functions,
which are primarily economic factors thought to influence
voters' views toward their leaders positively or negatively
(Lewis-Beck & Paldam, 2000; Mueller, 1970; Nannestad &
Paldam, 1994), and reaction functions, which are govern-
ment policy makers' reactions to their perceived popularity,
by which they try to manipulate economic variables to curry
voters' favor (Alesina, Roubini, & Cohen, 1997; Brender &
Drazen, 2005; Fair, 1978; Kramer, 1971). Many authors
have combined vote functions--factors leading to election
outcomes--with popularity functions--factors leading to
poll results--because almost all of the issues overlap
(Chappell, 1990; Nannestad & Paldam, 1994). Political sci-
entists have shown much interest in predicting national elec-
tion results using economic variables in such functions. The
"big three" popularity functions traditionally mentioned in
the literature are economic growth, inflation, and unemploy-
ment (Norpoth, 1996).
Jones (2002) considered many models developed since
1952 that attempt to predict U.S. elections and concluded
that the most effective single predictor of these election out-
comes is the state of the election-year economy. Fair (2002)
looked for a relationship between a number of different eco-
nomic factors and the percentage of the popular vote received
by the incumbent party's presidential candidates between
1920 and 1996. He found a strong relationship between
the election-year GDP growth and the percentage of popular
votes received. Biewald (2003), however, repeated Fair's
study with an additional 50 years of data and found that
election-year GDP growth is only weakly correlated with
election results.
Nannestad and Paldam (1994) found that studies relating
economic growth to election outcomes yielded inconsistent
results, so they discarded GDP as an explanatory variable
and instead emphasized inflation and unemployment. Jones
(2002) found some evidence for a relationship between the
election-year inflation rate and the percentage of popular
votes received. Biewald (2003), however, found that with the
inclusion of an additional 50 years of data, the inflation rate
was no longer related to election results. Chrystal and Peel
(1986) found that neither inflation nor unemployment was
robustly related to the popularity of the government.
Fair (1978, 1982, 1988) constructed models for predicting
the Democratic Party's share of the two-party popular vote
based on several factors, including the rate of change in
gross national product for two different durations prior to an
election, a time trend variable coded according to which
party was in power, and whether the election involved an
incumbent. One version of this model (Fair, 1988) achieved
a strong coefficient of determination (R2) of .89.
To an iteration of Fair's model, Gleisner (1992) added the
percentage change of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over
a 10-month period prior to the election. This addition signifi-
cantly improved the fit of the model and rendered Fair's time
trend variable insignificant. Chan and Jordan (2004) found
that the equity market's performance for 10 months prior to
an election was a better predictor than GDP growth of incum-
bents' election results in recent years. The following section
explores a possible theoretical explanation for these
improved results.
SocionomicVoting
Implicit in much of the economic voting literature is the pas-
sive organism model of human action: Humans are seen as
essentially reactive. Many of the social sciences have
adopted this stimulus­response model of human psychology
popularized by behaviorist psychologists such as Watson
(1913) and Skinner (1938) in the last century. Although
some scholars (Baars, 1986; Gardner, 1987) have since
rejected this model as too simplistic or inaccurate, it lives on
in many implicit assumptions of other social sciences,
including political science.
Specifically, the conceptualization of popularity and reac-
tion functions carries with it three assumptions: (a) that there
is a reciprocal causal relationship between the electorate's
opinions of its elected leaders (popularity functions) and the
economic policy responses of those leaders (reaction func-
tions); (b) that voters react to economic conditions, political
events, and manipulation so that various economic and policy
inputs have reactive voting outputs; and (c) that voters act con-
sciously and rationally after logically evaluating candidates'
political policies and deciding whether these policies have
served (under the theory of retrospective voting) or will serve
(under the theory of prospective voting) their best interests.
In contrast, socionomic theory offers competing models
of mood, human action, and making choices. Prechter (1999)
posited that social mood--the aggregate, unconscious levels
of optimism and pessimism in a society--emerges spontane-
ously in self-organizing human social systems, fluctuates
according to an internally regulated growth process described
by Elliott's (1938) wave model, is impervious to economic
and political stimuli, and drives collective human action and
nonrational decision making unconsciously in contexts of
uncertainty. Presidential elections--the focus of our study--
appear to qualify as a context of uncertainty. Delli Carpini
Prechter et al. 3
and Keeter (1996), Blendon et al. (1997), Paldam and
Nannestad (2000), and Aidt (2000) have documented con-
vincingly the typical voter's pervasive ignorance and uncer-
tainty with respect to information about elections. Rahn
(2000) found that "public mood" may be an important influ-
ence on political decision making, concluding that the degree
of uncertainty accounts for the extent to which mood influ-
ences political behavior.
Socionomic theory specifically applies to the reelection
or rejection of incumbents. Prechter (1989, 1999, 2003)
hypothesized that when social mood has been trending
toward optimism, voters will be more inclined to desire to
keep the incumbent in office; and when social mood has
been trending toward pessimism, voters will be more inclined
to desire a change from the incumbent. Contrasting sharply
with Stimson's (1991) more cognitive "policy mood" con-
cept, Prechter proposed that the policies of the incumbent
and his challenger are irrelevant to this dynamic. He sur-
mised that voters unconsciously (and erroneously) credit
incumbents for their positive moods and blame incumbents
for their negative moods. This explanation appears similar to
the responsibility hypothesis (Downs, 1957; Key, 1966), in
which voters blame the incumbent for consciously perceived,
externally produced, negative economic circumstances. In
the socionomic formulation, however, voters blame the
incumbent for unconsciously experienced, internally regu-
lated, negative social mood.
Under socionomic theory, policy statements and actions
by leaders are powerless to affect the mood of the voters;
instead, the mood of the voters has a powerful effect on the
policy statements and actions of leaders. Three studies sup-
ported this formulation. Kuklinski and Segura (1995)
reviewed literature concerning mood and politics and
reported that mood appeared unresponsive to politicians'
efforts to influence it. They further argued that Stimson's
policy mood concept "might better be viewed as affective:
when people become dissatisfied and angry, they come to
favor less government or at least a change in the govern-
ment's current activities" (Kuklinski & Segura, 1995, p. 13).
Nofsinger & Kim (2003) found a relationship between the
trend of social mood and the subsequent actions of U.S. law-
makers. They reported that Congress tended to tighten
investment restrictions after social mood had become more
negative, as indicated by a substantial decline in stock prices,
and tended to loosen investment restrictions after social
mood had become more positive, as indicated by a substan-
tial rise in stock prices. Geer (2006) reported that, rather than
negative political ads making voters feel more pessimistic,
voters' preexisting attitudes instead affected how candidates
chose their advertising. In concert with these suggestive
ideas, socionomic theory explicitly proposes that economic
and political trends are results of social mood, not causes, so
the direction of predictive power between mood and social
events is the opposite of that traditionally assumed.
Socionomic theory affirms the active organism model of
human action (Overton & Ennis, 2006; Overton & Reese,
1973) that humans are innately and spontaneously active in
their cognitive, affective, and conative processes. Under the
socionomic model, voters do not passively wait for politi-
cians' policies and promises to program their responses but
rather express social mood spontaneously. Under the hypoth-
esis that changes in social mood unconsciously impel
humans to take social actions expressing their moods, socio-
nomic theory proposes that changes in indicators of social
mood can be used to anticipate the direction and character of
social trends, including those in politics.
Socionomic theory pertains to voting tendencies at the
aggregate level. Many individual voters may, to a degree or
for a time, consistently cast ballots along party lines, reli-
gious lines, single-issue lines, philosophical lines, or some
other overriding factor. We suspect that "swing" voters with
little or no philosophical anchor are among the ones acting
most readily to express social mood in the voting booth.
Regardless of departures from socionomic motivation at the
individual level, social mood under this theory can power-
fully regulate voting outcomes at the aggregate level.
Prechter (1979, 1999; Prechter & Parker, 2007) has
argued that, for the present, stock market indexes appear to
be the best available indicator of social mood, because inves-
tors can act swiftly in this context to express their optimism
and pessimism. Recent work in the area of online social sen-
timent analysis by Bollen, Mao, and Zeng (2011) and Gilbert
and Karahalios (2010) provided empirical support for the
idea that financial markets are responsive to changes in
social sentiment. Because stock market averages register
changes in mood and possess an extensive data history, they
are uniquely appropriate for the long-term historical analysis
that we undertake in this article.
Riley and Luksetich (1980) saw the stock market as an
indicator of social mood. They implied, however, that political
parties influence mood by shaping the public's expectations of
future business conditions. Socionomic theory, in contrast,
proposes that social mood--a hidden, independent variable--
simultaneously determines both stock market outcomes and
incumbent presidential reelection outcomes. This formulation
avoids the error, as we see it, of confusing the indicator with
the cause. Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) ruminated over
whether political variables cause fluctuations in stock returns,
or the reverse.According to socionomic theory, neither formu-
lation is correct; rather, social-mood trends regulate stock
trends and political trends concurrently.
A popular explanation for why the economy often lags
the stock market is that investors accurately anticipate,
months in advance, the economic future and then rationally
invest on their expectations (Muth, 1961; Sheffrin, 1996).
Prechter (2003) challenged this idea on both theoretical
and empirical grounds. Socionomic theory proposes instead
that macroeconomic indicators, such as rates of economic
4 SAGE Open
growth, inflation, and unemployment, respond to social
mood to some degree, but they do so far less immediately, as
it takes months on average for business people to carry out
mood-motivated decisions due to the time requirements of
meeting, planning, lending or borrowing, opening or closing
facilities, hiring or firing, building or reducing inventory,
and so on. In the aggregate, these delayed results show up as
increases or decreases in production, expansions or contrac-
tions of credit, and increases or decreases in the labor force.
Investors, on the other hand, can buy or sell in the stock
market almost immediately in response to social mood, so
its effects appear there prior to appearing in macroeconomic
indicators.
Socionomic theory stands in contrast to expectations the-
ory in postulating that social mood regulates other social
variables, including the economy, which is merely another
result rather than the cause. We shall offer evidence that the
trend of social mood, not the trend of the stock market per se,
regulates voting with respect to the reelection or rejection of
incumbents.
Socionomic theory (Prechter, 1999) made the following
predictions regarding incumbents' reelection attempts:
1. An increasingly positive social mood, indicated by
a rising stock market, will positively influence an
incumbent's reelection chances.
2. An increasingly negative social mood, indicated by
a falling stock market, will negatively influence an
incumbent's reelection chances.
3. Extreme changes in social mood, indicated by
extreme changes in the stock market, will tend to
motivate more extreme voting preferences for or
against the incumbent.
4. An indicator of social mood, the stock market, will
predict the outcomes of reelection bids better than
will rates of economic growth, inflation, and/or
unemployment.
Method and Results
To investigate these formulations, we first examine the rela-
tionship between the net change in the stock market and the
ensuing popular vote margin--the number of percentage
points separating the incumbent from his nearest challenger
in the popular vote--for or against incumbent presidents in
U.S. elections. The Dow Jones Industrial Average serves to
represent the U.S. stock market from 1897 to the present.
Prior to 1897, we use the Foundation for the Study of
Cycles' data series, which normalizes stock market data
from earlier indexes to the Dow to create a longer series
(DJIA) that encompasses all U.S. presidential elections from
1789 through 2008. Popular vote margin is a broad measure
that is likely to reflect social mood in an election. For pur-
poses of validation, we also consider four other measures of
incumbent performance: percentages of total popular vote,
percentages of total electoral vote, electoral vote-margin
percentages, and overall wins and losses of elections.
Next, we examine the relationship between the stock mar-
ket and the fates of incumbents in landslide elections. We
then relate the stock market to the popular vote margin for an
incumbent's political party when the incumbent does not
run. A final set of analyses assesses the predictive ability of
the "big three" economic indicators--GDP, inflation, and
unemployment--when modeled individually and together
with the stock market.
Predicting Incumbent Election Results
We first compare the popular vote margin for or against an
incumbent president with the stock market's net percentage
gain or loss for the 3-year period preceding the election. We
operationally define the 3-year period as the span of time
from November 1 of the year after the previous election
through October 31 of the year of the election under consid-
eration. We select this period because we observe anecdot-
ally that society tends to judge a president by the trends that
occur during the bulk of the presidential term, barring much
or all of the first year, for which the credit or blame is typi-
cally assigned to the predecessor. Our analysis includes all
presidential elections in which an incumbent candidate ran,
beginning in 1824 when popular vote data were first avail-
able. A linear regression analysis yields a large and statisti-
cally significant effect, R2 = .328, p = .001. Table 1 displays
results for the test described above (see Line 3) as well as
further statistical results.
To assess the robustness of the results, we examine a
number of variations in model parameters and analytic
approaches. As shown in the table, significant positive pre-
dictive relationships continue to emerge when varying the
measuring period for the stock market to 1, 2, and 4 years.
We also bifurcate the data at two cutoff points: (a) the turn of
the 20th century and (b) the 100-year anniversary of the
inception of popular vote tallies, which also roughly corre-
sponds to the midpoint of the data span. The 3-year results
maintain across these bifurcated data sets. This consistency
is compatible with socionomic theory, which proposes that
social mood's influence on reelection results should be com-
parable despite any changes between the 19th and 20th cen-
turies in terms of campaign strategies, communications
technology, election rules, extent of public participation, and
so on. To relax distributional assumptions and lessen the
influence of potential outliers, we also apply the nonpara-
metric Spearman's rank correlation test to all data condi-
tions, and we obtain similar results, per Table 1.
As a final test of robustness, we repeat the entire analysis,
substituting four other measures of election results in place
of popular vote margin. Bivariate linear regression models
for three of these indicators--percentage of total popular
vote that the incumbent receives, percentage of total elec-
toral vote that the incumbent receives, and electoral vote
Prechter et al. 5
margin (the number of percentage points that separate the
incumbent from his nearest challenger in the electoral
vote)--produce similar results to those presented in Table 1.
Evaluating the fourth measure, the incumbent's overall suc-
cess or failure in winning the reelection bid, requires use of
logistic regression. Although this dichotomous variable suf-
fers from a reduction in reliable score variance in compari-
son with the continuously scaled criterion variables
considered earlier, positive predictive relationships generally
emerge, with a statistically significant (p = .022) logistic
regression coefficient associated with the condition of pri-
mary theoretical interest (see Table 2).
To summarize, our results signify that a net gain in the
stock market during the 3 years preceding an election is
strongly predictive of more votes cast for the incumbent rela-
tive to his nearest challenger, and a net stock market decline
during that period is strongly predictive of fewer votes cast
for the incumbent relative to his nearest challenger. More
generally, net stock market changes for 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year
periods preceding Election Day all serve as significant pre-
dictors of election outcomes.
IncumbentWins/Losses in Landslides
Socionomic theory proposes that more extreme changes in
social mood tend to motivate more extreme voting prefer-
ences for or against the leader. We test this hypothesis with
regard to reelection bids by examining the relationship
between prior net percentage change in the stock market and
incumbent vote margin when both are large.
We look first at landslide victories as measured by
electoral vote margins. Records of electoral votes extend
farther back in time than popular vote tallies and thus pro-
vide more data points to test. To define extreme conditions
operationally, we deem an election a landslide victory if the
incumbent competed for and won reelection by defeating
the nearest competitor with an electoral vote margin
of 40% or greater. We deem the election a landslide loss if
the incumbent running for reelection trailed the winner
by an electoral vote margin of 20% or greater. We define a
large positive stock market change as a net gain of 20% or
more in the preceding 3-year period, and a large negative
stock market change as a net loss of 10% or more. We
choose asymmetric percentage thresholds for electoral vote
margin and net stock market change, that is, (+40%, -20%)
and (+20%, -10%), respectively, to be consistent with the a
priori positive biases in both data series: Historically,
an incumbent has a better than 50% chance of reelection,
and the stock market tends to have a positive trend.
We summarize all historical data meeting these criteria in
a contingency table (Table 3). Fisher's exact test indicates a
high degree of association between the two variables
(p = .009). Although only 15 elections meet the criteria for
analysis, we can have confidence that the observed associa-
tion is unlikely to have arisen due to chance in view of the
exceptional predictive accuracy associated with these data
(i.e., a 93% classification rate). Results as good or better
would occur less frequently than 1 time in 100 if there is, in
fact, no relationship between the variables in the theoretical
population.
The strong relationship between landslide elections and
stock price movements is robust across a number of varia-
tions in the parameter definitions, scaling, and indicators in
the model, including the following:

market movement (i.e., whether considering per-

when using electoral vote thresholds of (+20%, -10%) and
the nominal DJIA with stock market thresholds of (+20%,
-10%) to be 94% (15 out of 16, p = .007). We also test pre-
ceding 4-year stock market thresholds in the nominal DJIA
of (+0%, -0%), thereby relaxing the requirement that the
movements be large, and electoral vote thresholds of (+40%,
-20%). We obtain a predictive success rate of 83% (19 out
of 23, p = .02).
With regard to alternative definitions of election results, a
large electoral vote advantage can sometimes occur in tan-
dem with only a small popular vote advantage because of the
nature of the Electoral College. Consequently, we analyze
popular vote landslides as a further means of testing the rela-
tionship under consideration. Because popular vote margins
Prechter et al. 7
are associated with fewer data points and tend to fall within
a tighter percentage range, we use smaller thresholds for
popular vote margins (+10%, -5%) and 3-year percentage
stock market changes in the nominal DJIA (+10%, -5%).
Even under these conditions, the data produce a predictive
success rate of 87% (13 out of 15, p = .01). In additional
analyses, subjecting the popular vote-margin data to the
many conditional and definitional variations described above
do not diminish this strong relationship. For example, using
popular vote-margin thresholds of (+10%, -10%) and 3-year
stock market thresholds of (+0%, -0%) in the nominal
DJIA, we obtain a predictive success rate of 92% (12 out of
13, p = .01).
As a final test of robustness, we combine the preceding
methodologies and define a landslide election victory as one
in which the victor wins by a large margin in either the popu-
lar vote (when data are available) or the electoral vote. This
is also a somewhat more intuitive definition of what might
qualify as a landslide victory. Using the same thresholds as
before for electoral vote margin (+40%, -20%), popular vote
margin (+10%, -5%), and stock market lognormal change
(+0.2, -0.1), we obtain a perfect classification rate (12 out of
12, p = .005). Again, the results are robust to the many varia-
tions we consider. For example, using thresholds of (+50%,
-50%) for electoral vote margin, (+20%, -10%) for popular
vote margin, and (+0.1, -0.05) for stock market lognormal
change results in a 94% predictive success rate (15 out of 16,
p = .007).
Observing confirmatory findings in response to numerous
methodological and analytical variations allows us to con-
clude with a high degree of confidence that large stock mar-
ket advances tend to be strongly associated with subsequent
landslide victories as opposed to landslide defeats for incum-
bent candidates in reelection bids. Conversely, large stock
market declines tend to be strongly associated with subse-
quent landslide defeats as opposed to landslide victories for
incumbents. The stock market movements and election
results shown in Figure 1 illustrate this association visually.
Figure 1 also includes some events that are outside the
boundaries of our restrictive statistical tests. We add them to
give readers a flavor of the power of extremities in social
mood to influence the tenure of leaders. Examples are King
George III's ousting as ruler of the American colonies in the
late 1700s near the end of a 64-year bear market in English
stocks, the regional rejection from ballots of many candi-
dates in 1860 following a 24-year period of lower stock
prices, and Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974 during the
biggest stock market decline in 36 years.
Predicting Election Results for an Incumbent's
Political Party
We next investigate whether the relationship between net
stock market change and popular vote margin extends to a
president's political party when the president is not running
for reelection. As shown in the linear regression results in
Table 4, we find no association between the 3-year net per-
centage change in the nominal DJIA and the popular vote
margin for a nonrunning incumbent's political party. We are
inclined to hypothesize that voters project their moods on
individual leaders, not parties.
Considering Predictors OtherThan
the Stock Market
Is the stock market a unique predictor of presidential reelec-
tion outcomes, or do any of the "big three" economic vari-
ables yield stronger results? In this section, we explore the
predictive power of GDP, inflation as measured by the
Producer Price Index (PPI), and the unemployment rate.
GDP
One might posit that GDP is the determining variable that
influences both the stock market and election outcomes, in
which case the link we observe between the stock market
and election outcomes is spurious. The data do not support
this causality, however, for two reasons.
First, in line with the leading indicators literature (Mitchell
& Burns, 1938/1961; Moore, 1961), we find stock market
movement to be a far better predictor of GDP than GDP is of
the stock market. Using data from 1790 to 2008, we observe a
simple correlation of .35 (p < 10-7) between contemporaneous
lognormal yearly changes in both the DJIA and GDP. Yet,
when lognormal yearly changes in the DJIA are used to pre-
dict the subsequent year's lognormal movement in GDP, we
observe a significant beta weight of .25 (p < .0002), versus no
relationship at all ( = -.02, p = .81) when we use lognormal
yearly changes in GDP to predict the subsequent year's log-
normal movement in the DJIA. Thus, GDP does not predict
stock market movement, but--in accordance with socionomic
theory (Prechter, 1999)--the stock market predicts GDP.
Second, we find that GDP exhibits a weaker relationship
to incumbents' election outcomes than we observe for the
DJIA. We repeat all of the regression analyses for incumbent
candidates, applying the same procedures and time intervals
described in earlier sections, but use GDP--both nominal and
real--as the predictor variable. The resulting regression equa-
tions are much weaker in predictive ability than those for the
DJIA. For example, substituting the 3-year percentage change
in nominal GDP for the DJIA to predict the incumbent's pop-
ular vote margin produces weaker relationships across the
board, including a reduced linear regression beta weight (.33
as opposed to .57 for the DJIA) and a smaller Spearman's
rank correlation (.27 vs. .59). Similar results occur when sub-
stituting real GDP as the predictor ( = .47 vs. .57,  = .46 vs.
.59). Although GDP continues to be a statistically significant
predictor of reelection outcomes in several of the analyses,
the level of significance is weaker than that of the DJIA.
When predicting the dichotomous criterion of election win/
8 SAGE Open
loss, neither real GDP nor nominal GDP emerges as a signifi-
cant predictor in logistic regression.
These results lead to the conclusion that GDP alone is not as
useful as the stock market alone in predicting reelection out-
comes. It is still possible that both GDP and the stock market
together predict election results, a scenario we take up shortly.
Inflation and Unemployment
We next apply the analyses described in the above section
while using the PPI, a measure of inflation, as the predictor
variable in simple regression. Using the 3-year percentage
change in the PPI rather than the DJIA to predict an incum-

Stock data are from 1760 to 2004.The most recent year in which an incumbent ran for reelection was 2004; that election did not yield a landslide result.

Prechter et al. 9
bent's popular vote margin results in a sizably worse beta
weight (.16 vs. .57 for the DJIA) and Spearman's rho (.15 vs.
.59), neither of which is statistically significant. The unem-
ployment rate, with data available from 1940 to the present,
fails to register as a significant predictor in the same simple
regression analysis. It yields a beta weight of -.11 and
Spearman's rho of -.18. Neither the PPI nor the unemploy-
ment rate is able to predict better than at chance levels with
regard to overall election win/loss.
The results are consistent with the negative conclusions
reached by Chrystal and Peel (1986) and Biewald (2003),
though our study of the unemployment rate may be some-
what affected by loss of power due to small sample size. In
sum, these sets of analyses suggest that changes in unem-
ployment and inflation rates (as measured by the PPI) in the
1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year periods prior to elections have no dis-
cernible relationship to presidential reelection outcomes.
Multiple Predictors
All of our analyses up to this point have used single predic-
tors. We now investigate multiple predictors to allow for
possible increases in predictive efficacy arising from vari-
able covariations (suppressor effects, variable interactions,
etc.). To identify any combinations of indicators that may
offer stronger predictive power, we repeat all of the analyses
described above using multiple regressions on various sets
of predictor variables. We include the set that results from
using hierarchical regression to determine the variable entry
sequence. We omit the unemployment rate due to an insuf-
ficient number of common data points.
In a large number of analyses, the DJIA remains the only
significant predictor of election outcomes when combined
with nominal GDP, real GDP, and/or the inflation rate. With
popular vote margin as the criterion, none of 11 combinations
of various independent variables registers as a significant pre-
dictor; the DJIA remains a significant predictor in all such
combinations. A similar pattern of results arises in conducting
nonparametric analyses of these variables. With election win/
loss as the criterion, every combination of variables again fails
to register as a significant predictor, whereas the DJIAachieves
statistical significance in all such combinations.
To address the possibility that our statistically significant
results may simply be an outcome of performing a large
number of tests, we conduct an omnibus Simes' test for mul-
tiple comparisons, where the complete null states that the
DJIA is unrelated to election outcomes. Requiring a family-
wise error rate of .05, and pooling in all the p-values reported
in Tables 1 to 3, we find that the complete null stands
rejected. Our findings indicate that none of the alternative
measures we test are as powerful as the stock market in pre-
dicting U.S. presidential reelection outcomes.
Discussion
In summary, we find that the stock market's performance
prior to a U.S. presidential election is a significant predictor
of an incumbent's reelection success. Our results are robust
to variations in the independent variable (nominal returns in
the DJIA vs. lognormal returns, and data durations of 1, 2, 3,
and 4 years), variations in the dependent variable (popular
vote margins, electoral vote margins, and a categorical win/
loss measure), statistical methods used, and the presence of
intervening variables. Generally, incumbents who preside
over a net advance in the stock market tend to obtain a
higher vote margin than incumbents who preside over a net
decline in the stock market in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 years before
the election. Of all the variations we test, the relationship
between the 3-year net percentage change in the DJIA and
the incumbent's popular vote margin is the strongest and
achieves the highest level of significance. Large stock mar-
ket advances during the final 3 years of incumbent candi-
dates' terms tend to be strongly associated with subsequent
landslide victories, as opposed to landslide defeats, for
incumbents in their reelection bids. Conversely, large stock
market declines during the final 3 years of incumbent candi-
dates' terms tend to be strongly associated with subsequent
landslide defeats, as opposed to landslide victories, for
incumbents in their reelection bids. The significant relation-
ships between stock market changes and election results do
not extend to the incumbent's party during elections that
feature no incumbent candidate. This difference suggests
that voting behavior changes depending on whether the elec-
tion includes an incumbent.
We find no significant relationship between the success
of reelection bids and prior net percentage change in infla-
tion (as measured by the PPI) or unemployment. GDP-based
simple regressions are sometimes significant but always
weaker than comparable regressions based on the stock mar-
ket. The stock market remains a significant predictor of the
outcome of incumbents' reelection bids when considered
with combinations of the aforementioned macroeconomic
variables in multiple regression analyses. The importance of
these other variables remains relatively weak or insignificant
when examined in combination with the stock market.
As a proposed hidden variable, social mood cannot be
tested directly or proven as a voting motivator in these analy-
ses. It is possible that other hidden variables may contribute
to or account for our findings. Nevertheless, our results are
consistent with the predictions made under the theory that
motivated the study while being substantially contrary to
economic voting perspectives, a topic we explore next.
Is the Stock Market Per Se a Causal Factor in
Reelection Results?
How can we ascertain whether it is more likely changes in
social mood--rather than changes in the stock market per
se--that influence reelection outcomes? We now consider
other economic voting arguments that may account for our
findings. For example, from the idea of egotropic voting,
one could argue that grateful stockholders--people who
made money in the stock market--would credit the incum-
bent for their financial success and vote accordingly,
10 SAGE Open
whereas those losing money in the market would reject the
incumbent (see, for example, Chan & Jordan, 2004).
Another potential explanation might be a variation on the
idea of sociotropic voting, in which presumably "voters are
influenced by their subjective views of the national economy
even though they are not much swayed by their personal
economic standing" (Erikson, 2004, p. 1). Perhaps voters,
whether they own stock or not, watch the stock market and
vote accordingly for the well-being of society.
The grateful (or ungrateful) stockholder explanation seems
untenable given that the data for GDP, PPI, and unemploy-
ment fail to support egotropic hypotheses of "grateful economic
participants," "grateful savers," or "grateful employees." This
problem for such an explanation seems doubly serious given
that economic participants, savers, and employees have
always outnumbered stockholders, usually substantially. We
are unaware of any reason why sociotropic voters' basis for
judging social well-being should be the stock market averages
in lieu of these other variables.
A cursory statistical analysis, moreover, substantially
invalidates the grateful stockholder explanation. Data
covering more than 100 years show that increased stock
ownership within the population does not positively influ-
ence the relationship between stock market movement and
incumbents' performance in reelection bids. A rigorous test
of the grateful stockholder explanation--of gain or loss in
stocks per se as a possible lurking variable--is confounded
by the lack of compatible data. (Available stock market
data, election data, and stock ownership data cover different
time periods; historical stock ownership data tend to be spo-
radic; and election data featuring incumbents are available
fewer times than once every 4 years.) We nonetheless devise
some simple tests. Stock ownership was likely negligible
across the national population prior to 1900, and indeed we
could find no robust data series; stock ownership from 1900
to 1950 ranged from 2.1% to 9.6% for years in which data
are available (Cox, 1963); and as of 2005, 50.4% of U.S.
households held stock (Investment Company Institute and
the Securities Industry Association, 2005). The grateful
stockholder explanation would seem to require that the rela-
tionship between the stock market and election outcomes
should be far stronger after 1900 than it was before 1900,
and far stronger after 1950 than it was before 1950. The
difference should be enough to reject the null hypothesis
that postulates no such difference. To test this idea, we con-
duct multiple linear regression to predict election outcomes
by stock market performance, time period (dichotomous
variables of pre-/post-1900 and pre-/post-1950), and the
interaction of stock market performance by time period. The
interaction effects do not emerge as statistically significant,
thus failing to support the grateful stockholder explanation.
Furthermore, as we see in Table 1, the association between
election outcomes and stock market performance is stronger
in the pre-1900 period than the post-1900 period, though
both are significant. Thus, we can safely conclude that voter
response to stock market gains/losses does not explain our
results.
Socionomic theory encounters no such counterindications
from the data. Its explanation holds: Voters in the aggregate
are not responding to stock market changes, economic
changes, inflation rates, or the availability of jobs; nor are
they voting rationally for social improvement. Rather, they
are voting in accordance with trends in social mood. An
increasingly positive social mood produces a rising stock
market as well as votes for the incumbent, and an increas-
ingly negative social mood produces a falling stock market
as well as votes against the incumbent, thus producing the
positive relationship we observe. When no candidate in a
presidential election is the recognized leader whom voters
have unconsciously credited or blamed for their mood, they
appear to base their voting decisions substantially on other
factors.
Future Research and Practical Implications
Theoretical assumptions can instill "strong prior beliefs on
both sides" (Hirshleifer, 2001, p. 1534) of a fundamental
question. Bias is especially strong against newer ideas,
which in recent years have included the proposal of nonra-
tionality in aggregate human behavior (Burnham, 2005,
pp. 41-52). One value of the socionomic hypothesis is that it
prompted this investigation of a relationship between certain
types of social variables, a tack that previous political
researchers' theoretical assumptions seem to have impeded
them from considering.
We did not set out to optimize a model for predicting elec-
tions but to explore a theoretical point. Nevertheless, we
hope our approach will open a new avenue for scholars who
build models to predict election outcomes. Instead of assum-
ing that the economy is the primary mover of voting prefer-
ences, researchers may wish to begin investigating indicators
of social mood as predictors of reelection outcomes and to
reinterpret economic data as resulting from voters' moods
rather than causing them.
Researchers may also wish to explore some of the nuances
that our rigid statistical tests are unable to detect. For exam-
ple, George H.W. Bush lost his bid for reelection even though
the Dow was higher over the three years leading to Election
Day. The broader Value Line Geometric Index, however, was
down 11% over the 3.1 years prior to Election Day. So,
Bush's landslide loss is not incompatible with socionomic
theory even though our tests scored it otherwise. Similar
subtleties attend other apparent departures from socionomic
expectations, but we have assiduously avoided data fitting to
capture such results. Also, distinguishing between bull mar-
kets and bear market rallies reveals some informative
nuances regarding incumbents' popularity and reelection
chances. Future researchers may wish to investigate these
Prechter et al. 11
considerations further. Future political studies might also
examine the relationship of social mood to the timing of new
dictatorships, the frequency of political apologies, and out-
breaks of peace and war. Under a broader umbrella, we pro-
pose analyzing social mood as it relates to a wide variety of
social activities, from instances of mass celebration or
destructive riot to trends in fads, fashions, and popular
entertainment.
Our results suggest a practical strategy for political par-
ties: Whenever one of a party's potential candidates is an
incumbent who has served during a period of major mood
setback as indicated by a large net decline in the stock mar-
ket--in real or nominal terms--that party may increase its
chance of retaining control of the presidency if it chooses to
nominate a candidate other than the incumbent. Our findings
also may be of practical value to those who wish someday to
seek the presidency: A newcomer's chance of success
improves when competing against an incumbent who has
served during a period of declining social mood. Likewise,
an incumbent who has held office during a major setback in
social mood may wish to consider declining to run for a sec-
ond term and await more favorable conditions to pursue the
presidency again or retire from presidential politics to spend
hard-earned political capital on other efforts.
Conclusion
Stock market performance relates significantly and posi-
tively to the outcome of U.S. presidents' reelection bids.
Hypotheses of economic voting fail to account for our find-
ings. Our results, however, are consistent with Prechter's
socionomic theory, specifically that social mood, an inter-
nally regulated psychological variable reflected in stock
indexes, is more powerful than economic variables in moti-
vating voting behavior whenever a leader faces reelection.
Our work supports the inclusion of stock market perfor-
mance in models that forecast the outcomes of reelection
bids of U.S. presidents and, we hope, prompts further litera-
ture on socionomic voting.
