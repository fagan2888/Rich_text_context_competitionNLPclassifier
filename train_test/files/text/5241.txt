Abstract
Objective: To investigate the associations between b1
-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) and
cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene polymorphisms and b-blocker treatment outcomes in
patients with hypertension.
Methods: Chinese patients with essential hypertension were treated with the b-blocker
metoprolol and followed up for 12 weeks. xTAGÕ liquid-chip technology was used for CYP2D6
100 C > T and ADRB1 1165G > C genotyping. Associations between gene polymorphisms and
antihypertensive therapy outcomes were assessed by generalized linear model fitting. A decrease
of ! 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure indicated an effective treatment outcome.
Results: A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Mutant allele frequencies of 61.29% and
58.60% were obtained for ADRB1 and CYP2D6, respectively. There was no significant interaction
between the effects of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treatment outcome. Patients
homozygous for the mutant ADRB1 genotype (CC) had better treatment outcomes than those
heterozygous for the mutation (GC). Interestingly, b-blocker treatment duration was an
independent factor associated with treatment outcome.
Conclusions: The ADRB1 1165G > C gene polymorphism and b-blocker treatment duration are
independent factors associated with b-blocker treatment outcome. These findings suggest that the
selection of antihypertensive therapy should take into consideration the patient's genotype.

Introduction
Essential hypertension is a multifactorial
disorder, with interactions between many
genetic and environmental risk factors
underlying its pathogenesis.1,2 It is a major
public health problem throughout the
world;3 in China, there are around 200
million patients with hypertension, giving a
prevalence of $20% in adults.4,5 Many
candidate genes have been recognized as
potential contributors to the pathogenesis of
hypertension.6 Polymorphisms of the b1
-
adrenoceptor7 and of cytochrome P450
2D6 (CYP2D6)8 have been reported to be
involved in the pathogenesis of high blood
pressure and related cardiovascular events.
The b1
-adrenoceptor is encoded by the
ADRB1 gene, which has two single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms: Ser49Gly and
Arg389Gly. The Gly49 allele of the
Ser49Gly polymorphism is associated with
greater agonist-promoted downregulation
and altered glycosylation of the receptor,9
while the Arg389 variant has been reported
to have basal and isoprenaline-activated
adenylyl cyclase activity that is three- to
four-fold higher than the Gly389 variant.10
These factors may explain the observed
cardiovascular differences and varying
responses to b-blockers between those with
different ADRB1 genotypes. For example,
Chinese men homozygous for the Arg389
variant have been reported to show heigh-
tened responses to metoprolol, in terms of
resting heart rate as well as resting and
exercise blood pressure.11 Furthermore, in
patients with essential hypertension, both the
Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly polymorphisms
have been found to be associated with the
response to metoprolol treatment: patients
with Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 were the
best responders, while little or no response
was observed in patients with Gly49Arg389/
Ser49Gly389.12,13 However, there is an
ongoing debate concerning the importance
of this effect, with one study reporting no
major effect of these polymorphisms on the
response to atenolol treatment.14
The enzyme CYP2D6 accounts for only a
small percentage (<2%) of all hepatic cyto-
chromes, but is responsible for the metab-
olism of $25% of all drugs in current
clinical use.15­17 Several studies have exam-
ined the effects of CYP2D6 phenotype in
relation to the cardiovascular system.18
Polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene are
associated with a wide variety in CYP2D6
enzyme activity, ranging from complete
deficiency to ultrafast metabolism.19 10-
Hydroxylation of the b-blocker bufuralol
by CYP2D6 was markedly decreased with
the CYP2D6 variant Ser34 compared with
the Pro34 variant, indicating that CYP2D6
Pro34Ser polymorphism is significantly
associated with CYP2D6 enzyme activity.20
Although several studies have identified an
influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on
metoprolol metabolism rate,16,21 inconsist-
ent data have been reported with regard to
response to metoprolol therapy,22 with some
studies reporting an association23 and others
showing little or no effect.24
Although there is some evidence that
ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms
influence the response to antihypertensive
therapy with b-blockers, there is ongoing
debate concerning the clinical importance of
these effects. Furthermore, it is not known
whether an interaction exists between the
effects resulting from polymorphisms of
these two genes. The aim of the present
Wu et al. 425
study was to investigate the association
between the ADRB1 1165G > C
(Arg389Gly) and the CYP2D6 100 C > T
(Pro34Ser) polymorphisms, and outcomes
in patients with hypertension treated with
the b-blocker metoprolol.
Patients and methods
Patients
Chinese patients attending the Department
of Cardiovascular Medicine, First Affiliated
Hospital of Fujian Medical University,
Longyan, China, aged 40­65 years, with
grade I­II essential hypertension (systolic
blood pressure 140­179 mmHg and/or dia-
stolic blood pressure 90­109 mmHg), diag-
nosed according to the 1999 World Health
Organization/International Society of
Hypertension guidelines,25 with no previous
exposure to b-blockers, were recruited to the
study between June 2012 and December
2012. Exclusion criteria included severe car-
diac, liver or renal disease, patient
withdrawal from the study or incomplete
clinical data.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical
University, Longyan, China.
Fasting blood samples were collected at
$06.00 h from all patients on admission to
the study for the measurement of fasting
blood glucose, triglyceride and uric acid.
Blood glucose samples were collected using
potassium oxalate as an anticoagulant. All
samples were sent for immediate analysis.
All patients received 25 mg metoprolol
twice a day or 40.5 mg sustained release
metoprolol tartrate once a day. No other
antihypertensive therapy was given. Blood
pressure was measured every 4 weeks, and
patients were followed up for 12 weeks. A
decrease of !10 mmHg in the systolic blood
pressure was considered to indicate an
effective treatment outcome.
Genotyping and xTAG liquid-chip
technology
Before commencing antihypertensive treat-
ment, a 2ml peripheral blood sample, antic-
oagulated with 15mg/ml ethylenediamine
tetra-acetic acid, was collected from each
patient for genotyping. Samples were shaken
gently approximately eight times to ensure the
anticoagulant was well mixed, then stored at
­20C until analysis. A DNA extraction kit
(SurExam Biotech, Guangzhou, China) was
used, according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions, to separate genomic DNA. Genotyping
for ADRB1 1165G> C and CYP2D6
100C> T was performed using xTAGÕ
liquid-chip technology (Luminex, Austin, TX,
USA). The xTAG protocol begins with a
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
which is used to amplify regions of the target
genes containing the mutation site. The result-
ing PCR products are treated with exonuclease
I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to remove
excess nucleotides and primers, and cleaned
using Exo-SAPÕ (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). They are then subjected to an
allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) step
usingspecificprimersequencescomplementary
to the given genes of interest that are tagged
with an xTAG universal tag sequence. These
primer sequences were 50-CCGCAAGGCCT
TCCAGG-30 for the wild type and 50-
CGCAAGGCCTTCCAGC-30 for the muta-
tionfortheADRB11165G> Cpolymorphism,
and 50-GGGCTGCACGCTACC-30 for the
wild type and 50-GGGCTGCACGCTACT-30
for the mutation for the CYP2D6 100C> T)
polymorphism. The ASPE products were
then hybridized to specific antitag probes
precoated onto polystyrene microspheres,
and streptavidin phycoerythrin was added
for fluorescent detection using a Luminex
200 Analyzer (Luminex).

Results
Patients
A total of 93 patients with essential hyper-
tension were enrolled in the study. Patients'
baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1, and their demographic and clinical
characteristics according to age group are
given in Table 2. The majority of patients
were aged 40­59 years (n ¼ 84; 90.3%), with
clinical stage II disease (n ¼ 76; 81.7%) and a
disease duration of !1 year (n ¼ 87; 93.5%).
Genotyping
The results of genotyping for ADRB1
1165G > C and CYP2D6 100 C > T are
given in Table 3. The ADRB1 1165G > C
mutant allele had an overall frequency of
61.29%, with frequencies of 24.73%,
27.96% and 47.31% for the wild-type
(GG), heterozygous mutation (GC) and
homozygous mutation (CC) alleles, respect-
ively (Table 3). The CYP2D6 100C > T
mutant allele had an overall frequency of
58.60%, with frequencies of 24.73%,
33.33% and 41.94% for the wild-type
(CC), heterozygous mutation (CT) and
homozygous mutation (TT) alleles, respect-
ively (Table 3). There were no significant
differences in sex, smoking status or age for
the various ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genotypes
analysed (Table 4).
Correlations between polymorphisms and
treatment outcomes
There was no significant interaction between
the effects of the ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genes
on treatment outcome (Table 5). When the
effects of ADRB1 1165G > C and CYP2D6
100 C > T polymorphisms on the outcome of
antihypertensive therapy with b-blockers for
12 weeks were analysed, ADRB1 poly-
morphism was shown to have a significant
effect on therapeutic outcome (P < 0.05)
(Table 6). Results of our analyses investigat-
ing the effects of CYP2D6 polymorphism on
the outcome of antihypertensive therapy in
this Chinese cohort were not statistically
significant (data not shown). Tukey's post-
hoc analysis indicated that patients homo-
zygous for the mutant ADRB1 genotype
(CC) had better treatment outcomes (sys-
tolic value after treatment) than those het-
erozygous for the mutation (GC) (P < 0.05)
(Figure 1). Using multivariate ANOVA,
four correction methods indicated that dur-
ation of treatment with the b-blocker was an
independent factor associated with treat-
ment outcome (P < 0.05) (Table 7); however,
there was no correlation between ADRB1
polymorphisms and the duration of b-
blocker treatment (P > 0.05) (Table 8).

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that, in
Chinese patients with essential hyperten-
sion, ADRB1 polymorphisms exert a much
more important effect on the outcome of
therapy with b-blockers than CYP2D6 poly-
morphisms, with superior efficacy found in
patients homozygous for the ADRB1
1165G > C mutant genotype. Frequencies
of 61.29% and 58.60%, respectively, were
obtained for the ADRB1 and CYP2D6
mutant alleles. There was no significant
interaction between the effects of ADRB1
and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treat-
ment outcomes.
Furthermore, the duration of b-blocker
treatment was shown to be an independent
factor associated with treatment outcome
for antihypertensive therapy with b-block-
ers. Tailoring therapy to a patient's geno-
type could potentially improve the efficacy
of antihypertensive treatment.
The pathogenesis of essential hyperten-
sion is influenced by the interaction of many
environmental and genetic factors.1,2
Several gene variants have been evaluated
as candidate determinants for hypertension.
The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic,
with $80 distinct alleles and allele variants.
CYP2D6 polymorphisms have been demon-
strated to affect the enzymatic activity of the
expressed protein,26,27 which has been
shown to have a major impact on the
pharmacokinetics of the b-blocker metopro-
lol.8,28 This has led to questions about the
effects of these kinetic differences on drug
adverse effects and efficacy.21,29 In the pre-
sent study, the CYP2D6 100 C > T poly-
morphism had a starkly reduced effect on b-
blocker efficacy compared with the ADRB1
1165G > C polymorphism, which is are

generally in agreement with previous stu-
dies.26 Although CYP2D6 polymorphisms
have been demonstrated to affect the meta-
bolic rate of metoprolol in some studies,16,21
inconsistent findings have been reported
with regard to the influence of these poly-
morphisms on the response to metoprolol
therapy.22 Notably, some investigators have
reported an association between the
response to metoprolol and the CYP2D6*4
allele,23 while others have observed
little or no effect on antihypertensive
response rates, blood pressure changes or
adverse event rates associated with several
polymorphisms, despite clear differences
between the variants in enzymatic activity.24

Hence, it is likely that CYP2D6 polymorph-
isms have no major clinical impact on the
response to therapy with b-blockers.
The b-blockers play a major role in the
treatment of essential hypertension, and are
widely used for the management of cardio-
vascular diseases. The efficacy of b-blockers
is mainly attributed to their actions at the
b1
-adrenoceptor, which plays an important
role in regulating the activity of the sympa-
thetic nervous system.30 However, the
response to b-blockers varies between indi-
viduals, and this may be due in part to
ADRB1 gene polymorphisms. Multiple stu-
dies have demonstrated the influence of
ADRB1 polymorphisms on the response to
treatment with b-blockers. For example, the
expression level of myocardial ADRB1 was
shown to affect the antihypertensive effects
of metoprolol.31 In addition, a clear associ-
ation between ADRB1 polymorphisms and
antihypertensive response to b-blockers
such as metoprolol and carvedilol has been
demonstrated.32,33 Importantly, a frequent
ADRB1 polymorphism affecting the heart-
rate response to carvedilol has been identi-
fied.34 The present study demonstrated that
the ADRB1 mutation had a significant clin-
ical effect on b-blocker therapy. This is
consistent with reports that mutations in
the ADRB1 gene cause decreased b1
-adre-
noceptor sensitivity,26,27 and is in good
agreement with other findings in both
healthy individuals and essential hyperten-
sion patients. In healthy men, homozygosity
for the Arg389 allele appeared to confer an
enhanced response to metoprolol in terms of
heart rate and blood pressure.11,35

with essential hypertension, treated for 12 weeks with b-blockers. MM, homozygous mutation; WM,
heterozygous mutation; WW, wild-type.
430 Journal of International Medical Research 43(3)
Furthermore, in essential hypertension
patients, Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly
polymorphisms were associated with
the response to metoprolol therapy,
with Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 and Gly49
Arg389/Ser49Gly389 being found in the best
and worst responders, respectively.12,13
Other studies have revealed an association
between Gly389 and lower systolic and/or
diastolic blood pressures, as well as reduced
risk of essential hypertension.35­37 The
Ser49Gly polymorphism has also been
shown to be associated with heart rate,7
diastolic blood pressure38 and the systolic
blood pressure response to antihypertensive
medication.39 Interestingly, pharmacoki-
netic studies have shown an impact of
ADRB1 polymorphisms on carvedilol
pharmacokinetics.30 In particular, real-time
optical recording has demonstrated differ-
ences in the response to carvedilol between
the two codon-389 alleles in ADRB1
Arg389Gly polymorphisms.40
A few limitations of the present study
need to be considered. First, this was a
preliminary prospective study with loose
patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, sus-
ceptible to the limitations and biases inher-
ent in such a design. Second, the sample size
was small, meaning that the data may not
properly define the gene­drug interactions.
Furthermore, the follow-up time was very
short. Therefore, a large-scale, prospective,
controlled study is needed to conErm the
importance of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene
polymorphisms on the antihypertensive
effect of b-blockers.
In conclusion, the identification of appro-
priate genetic markers may be of great
benefit for the management of hypertension
and related chronic diseases in future,
allowing the tailoring of personalized

Data from the present study demonstrated
that the ADRB1 1165G > C homozygous
mutant genotype is associated with
increased b-blocker efficacy in hypertension,
suggesting that the selection of antihyper-
