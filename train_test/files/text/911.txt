OBJECTIVE: To examine how the relationship between parity increase and weight gain is modi®ed by sociodemo-
graphic and behavioral factors.
DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal data from the ®rst National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I,
1971±75) and its follow-up of those aged 25 y and older, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Survey (NHEFS, 1982±
84).
SUBJECTS: The analytical sample was nationally representative of the United States and included 2952 white or
African-American non-pregnant women aged 25±45 y at baseline, who were re-measured approximately 10 y later.
MEASUREMENTS: Statistical interactions in multiple linear and logistic regression models were examined to identify
how eight sociodemographic and three behavioral factors modi®ed the effect of parity increase on body weight
change and risk of substantial weight gain.
RESULTS: Factors that increased parity-associated weight gain included being African-American, living in a rural area,
not working outside the home, having fewer children, lower income and lower education, and being unmarried.
Among white women, being younger and having higher body weight at baseline increased parity-associated weight
gain, while among African-American women, being older and having lower body weight increased parity-associated
weight gain. African-American smokers gained less weight with an increase in parity, while the interactions between
smoking and physical activity with parity-associated weight gain in whites were complex.
CONCLUSION: The effects of sociodemographic and behavioral factors on parity-associated weight gain varied by
race and parity change, with the most consistent ®ndings being that unmarried and unemployed white women had
greater parity-associated weight gain, while both white and African-American women who smoked, had higher
education, or higher parity had lower parity-associated weight gain. This information may contribute to better
targeting and more effective interventions to prevent postpartum weight retention.

Introduction
The proportion of US women who are overweight is
increasing.1 Being overweight is a risk factor for
excess morbidity and mortality from chronic dis-
ease2,3 and carries negative psychological and social
consequences as well.4 Having children is frequently
cited as a cause of weight gain among women and a
contributor to their becoming overweight.5,6 Studies
of the effect of childbearing on body weight have
found a range of postpartum weight retention from
none at all to 2.0 kg per live birth.6±14 Recent data
from the National Health and Nutrition Survey's
Epidemiological Follow-up Survey on white women
aged 25±45 y who were followed for 10 y found
childbearing to be associated with excess weight
gain of approximately 1.7 kg and with increased risk
of both substantial weight gain and becoming over-
weight.13
High gestational weight gain,7,10,15±18 African-
American race, younger age, and low socioeconomic
status4,14,16,19,20 have all been associated with post-
partum weight retention, but a number of the support-
ing studies are limited due to reliance on self-reported
weights, failure to control for sociodemographic and
behavioral factors that in¯uence weight gain and loss,
or the use of small or localized samples.
The present study examines how the association
between parity increase and weight gain is modi®ed
by sociodemographic factors such as age, race and
employment and behavioral factors such as exercise
and smoking. We used the most comprehensive pro-
spective national data set available of those that
include measured weights. Identifying relevant socio-

mine if certain groups of US women are more likely to
experience excessive postpartum weight gain and
which types of intervention are warranted.
Methods
We used data from the ®rst National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I)21,22 and
its ten year follow-up, the NHANES I Epidemiologic
Follow-up Survey (NHEFS),23 both conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
NHANES I, which was carried out from 1971±1975,
used a nationally representative probability sample of
adults aged 17±74 y residing in the contiguous 48 US
states. Subjects who were aged 25±74 y when they
participated in NHANES I (n  14 407) were system-
atically followed up between 1982 and 1984 in the
NHEFS. Of the 13,383 who were located, 2022 had
died and 10,149 participated in the personal inter-
view.24,25 Participants underwent an extensive perso-
nal interview at both baseline and follow-up, a
detailed baseline medical examination and at follow-
up, measurement of weight and blood pressure. More
detailed descriptions of the design, sample and mea-
surement procedures are available from NCHS.21±23,26
Our original analytical sample was limited to the
3179 women in the NHEFS who were aged 25±45 y at
baseline (NHANES I); were white or African-Amer-
ican (Hispanics, Asians and other races were
excluded); had a measured weight at follow-up;
were not pregnant at baseline or follow-up; had not
been pregnant in the last 6 mo at baseline or the last
12 mo at follow-up (pregnancy status in the last 6 mo
was asked only at baseline) and who did not have their
®rst birth (live or stillborn) at the age of 15 y or
younger. Choosing 45 y as the upper limit was
designed to limit the sample to women of childbearing
age, and to make the present analysis comparable to
the prospective study of Williamson et al,13 which the
current study extends by examining how the parity-
weight relationship they identi®ed using these data is
modi®ed by sociodemographic and behavioral vari-
ables.
The major independent variable of interest was
parity change, that is, the difference between the
reported number of live births at baseline and at
follow-up. At the baseline interview, women who
said they had ever been pregnant were asked to
report separately their total number of pregnancies,
miscarriages and live births. To increase privacy, a
self-administered reproductive history questionnaire
was used at follow-up, although 20% of respondents
opted to have the interviewer read the questions to
them instead.15 Women who reported ever having
been pregnant were asked: `How old were you when
your ®rst child was born? This means the ®rst child
born alive or stillborn'; `How old were you when your
last child was born?'; `How many live births have you
had?'; `Have you ever had a miscarriage?' and `How
many miscarriages have you had?' In addition, as part
of the personal interview, women were asked, `How
many children living or deceased have you had?
Remember not to include adopted or stepchildren.'
Following Williamson et al,13 we used other infor-
mation on reproductive history to adjudicate
responses in which fewer live births were reported
at follow-up than at baseline, or where there was an
increase in parity but inconsistency in other reproduc-
tive history variables (for example, the mother's
reported age when she had her last child was lower
than her baseline age). We corrected 64 of 69 cases
with the birth discrepancies and 29 of the 101 cases
with other discrepancies: the other 77 cases could not
be adjudicated and were deleted from the sample. An
additional 150 women who had missing values for one
or more of the variables used in the sociodemographic
regression model were excluded as well, leaving a
®nal analytical sample of 2952 (2534 white women
and 418 African-American women).
For white women, parity change between baseline
and follow-up was categorized as none, one, or two or
more. For African-Americans, we collapsed the latter
two categories into one because of their small sample
size.
Weight change and the likelihood of substantial
weight gain were the two dependent variables exam-
ined. Weight change was de®ned as weight at follow-
up minus weight at baseline, using measurements (in
kg) on calibrated scales taken by trained personnel.
`Substantial weight gain' was de®ned analytically as
an increase of more than 25 pounds (11.4 kg) between
baseline and follow-up. This cut-off was chosen to
have a minimum cell size (for white subjects) of 20
women with both substantial weight gain and a parity
increase of two or more, which was needed to exam-
ine interactions with other variables. Data also were
analyzed with other cut-offs for substantial weight
gain, such as that used by Williamson et al,13 which
provided similar but less stable results. Body mass
index (BMI) change was not used as an outcome
variable due to increasing awareness that the use of
ratios as response variables in regression analyses can
lead to spurious results and that adjusting for the
denominator measure (in this case height) by includ-
ing it as a covariate in the regression is preferred.27,28
Examining how sociodemographic and behavioral
factors modi®ed the relationship between parity
increase and weight gain involved the testing of
interactions. Eight sociodemographic covariates and
their interactions with parity change in relation to
weight gain were examined. These included baseline
weight; baseline parity (continuous, truncated at 11 as
there were very few women with parities greater than
11 and differential effects were not expected for these
higher parities); baseline age (y); employment status
at baseline (employed or not); marital status at base-

line (married or not); rural versus metropolitan resi-
dence (based on where they `lived most of their life'
as answered at follow-up, or based on size of place
where they resided at baseline if the follow-up
response was missing in the data); family income at
baseline (six ordinal categories) and educational level
at baseline (continuous from 5±17 y, truncated at both
ends). We adjusted for three additional covariates in
all regression models examined: baseline height (in
cm), the square of the subject's age to adjust for the
curvilinearity of the relationship between body weight
and age, and the number of years between the baseline
and follow-up measurements as a control for the
duration of opportunity for weight change. Both
height squared and parity squared were also examined
but were not included in further analyses, as the
relationship between height and parity with weight
gain showed no evidence of curvature. Continuous
variables were centered at meaningful values in their
middle or near their means to make the regression
coef®cients easier to interpret (height was centered at
162.6 cm; baseline weight at 63.6 kg; age at 35 y;
years to follow-up at 10 y; education at 12 y; income
at $10,000±15,000 and parity at 2).29 The centered
forms of these variables were used to create the
interaction terms.
Three behavioral variables and their interactions
with parity change in relation to weight change were
examined: cigarette smoking, recreational exercise
and nonrecreational physical activity ± all using base-
line values to assure that the behavior occurred before
any weight change (the sample was too small to
include change in these behaviors over the 10 y).
Smoking status was treated as a dichotomous variable,
smoker or nonsmoker. We grouped former smokers
with never smokers, because of studies that have
found former smokers to be neither heavier nor
fatter than never smokers30,31 and because there
were too few former smokers to examine them sepa-
rately. Smoking was not assessed at baseline for a
large proportion of the sample. For these cases,
NCHS's retrospective determination of baseline
smoking status using smoking information from the
follow-up questionnaire was used (the 42 cases in our
sample for whom baseline smoking status could not
be determined from either questionnaire were treated
as missing rather than using NCHS's imputed values).
Physical activity was assessed with two three-level
questions: `Do you get much exercise in things you do
for recreation?' (much exercise, moderate exercise, or
little or no exercise) and `In your usual day, aside
from recreation, how active are you?' (very active,
moderately active or quite inactive). Two dummy
variables were created for each question, with the
moderate group as the reference group. Because one-
day caloric consumption was available for only a
portion of the sample, it was not included in the
analysis.
We used multiple linear and logistic regression
procedures to determine how the relationship between
parity increase and weight gain was modi®ed by
sociodemographic and behavioral variables.32 Using
a standard statistical package,33 we examined two
regression models for each dependent variable
(weight change and substantial weight gain). In the
®rst model, we examined 12 sociodemographic and
biological variables (11 described previously plus
parity change) and looked speci®cally for interactions
between parity change and the following: baseline
weight, parity, age, employment status, marital status,
family income, educational level and rural/urban resi-
dence. We used a P-value of 0.10 to screen interaction
terms so as not to miss any important interactions.29 In
the second model, after adjusting for the sociodemo-
graphic variables and their interactions that had a
P ` 0.10, we added the three behavioral variables
(cigarette smoking, recreational exercise and nonrec-
reational physical activity) and their interactions with
parity increase. We used separate regression models
for whites and African-Americans, because there were
not enough African-Americans to examine racial
differences in the same model using three-way inter-
actions.
To provide nationally representative results we
used NCHS-generated sample weights. The possible
effects of in¯uential (extreme) observations on the
regression estimates were examined by using standard
diagnostic tests for leverage29 and by examining the
models with and without the most in¯uential cases.
Because the results changed little without the extreme
cases, all cases were included. Tests for collinearity
also were performed and no problems were detected.29
Because the NHANES study design used complex
cluster sampling that required adjustment of the stan-
dard errors for inferential statistics,34 we adjusted for
the design effects of cluster sampling using SUDAAN
software.35
Results
Sample characteristics and parity-associated weight
gain
Table 1 shows that weight gain from baseline to
follow-up averaged 4.4 kg for white women and
5.5 kg for African-American women; in both cases
the great majority of the subjects had no increase in
parity, most having completed childbearing (all sub-
jects were at least 25 y at baseline). Almost a third of
white women and slightly more than half of African-
American women were overweight at follow-up.
Parity-associated weight gain was considerable in
whites, and was greater in African-American women.
Among white women, after adjusting for baseline
parity and the other sociodemographic variables,
weight gain for non-employed married metropolitan
women averaged 4.2 kg for those with no change in
parity, compared to 4.7 kg for those with a parity
increase of one child and 7.4 kg for those with a parity

increase of two or more children (Table 2). Overall,
weight gain averaged 5.5 kg for those with a parity
increase of one or more (result not shown). Among
African-American women, adjusted weight gain for
those with no change in parity averaged 4.9 kg,
compared to 7.2 kg for those with a parity increase
of one or more.
The probability of substantial weight gain (more
than 11.4 kg between baseline and follow-up) also
rose with parity increase. White women with a
parity increase of two or more were almost twice as
likely to experience substantial weight gain as those
with no change in parity (Table 3). However, the
probability increased only slightly for those with a
parity increase of just one. Among African-American
women, those with an increase in parity were about
®ve times as likely to experience substantial weight
gain as those with no parity increase.
Modi®cation of parity-associated weight gain by socio-
demographic and behavioral factors
Table 2 presents the predicted weight gains, and Table
3 the predicted probabilities of substantial weight
gain, for each of the sociodemographic and behavioral
variables that interacted with parity increase at
P ` 0.10. Although the values in the tables were to
illustrate general trends for the whole sample, the
actual values shown, unless otherwise speci®ed, are
those for non-employed, married women residing in
metropolitan areas when the other covariates were set
at their middle values (the full regression models are
not shown but are available from the authors).
For whites, a parity increase of two or more was
associated with greater weight gain in women with
higher baseline weight compared to those with lower
baseline weight, in non-employed compared to
employed women, and in non-married compared to
married women (Table 2). For example, white women
who were not employed gained an additional 3.2 kg
with a parity increase of two or more compared to
those with no parity increase, while employed women
gained only an additional 0.2 kg. Smoking also inter-
acted with parity increase in its effect on weight gain
in white women, but with mixed results. Among
women with a parity increase of two or more, smokers
gained less additional weight (when compared to
women with no parity increase) than nonsmokers,
but among women with a parity increase of one,
smokers gained much more additional weight.

Parity associated weight gain
WS Wolfe et al
805
Among African-Americans, a parity increase of one
or more was associated with greater weight gain in
women with lower baseline weight, in those with
lower incomes, and in nonsmokers. Smokers in this
group not only gained less weight than nonsmokers,
but they also gained far less than smokers with no
increase in parity.
Table 3 shows that among white women, being not
employed, unmarried, in a rural residence, with lower
educational attainment, having fewer children at base-
line and having a higher level of nonrecreational
physical activity at baseline, all increased the prob-
ability of gaining more than 11.4 kg given an increase
in parity of two or more (and for marital status, also
for a parity increase of one). Younger age increased
the probability of substantial weight gain given an
increase in parity of one.
Among African-Americans, the effect of a parity
increase of one or more on the probability of gaining
more than 11.4 kg was similar to a parity increase of
two or more among whites. Those with lower educa-
tional attainment and fewer children at baseline were
more likely to have a substantial weight gain. In
addition, older women were more likely to experience
substantial weight gain with an increase in parity than
were their younger counterparts.
Discussion
Concern about the increased prevalence of obesity has
heightened interest in the relationship between parity
and weight. Previous studies have shown that parity-
associated weight gain, that is, the weight gain related
to having children, is fairly small, about 1 kg per
child.11 In this prospective study we found that
parity-associated weight gain for white women aver-
aged 0.5 kg for those with an increase of one child and
3.2 kg for those with an increase of two or more.
Among African-American women, the average parity-

of one or more children. The present study broadens
our understanding of parity and weight by identifying
a variety of sociodemographic and behavioral factors
that are associated with greater parity-associated
weight gain.
Race. Our ®nding that parity-associated weight gain
was greater in African-Americans than in whites
con®rms reports by other investigators4,16,19,36,37 as
well as our own cross-sectional analysis of NHANES
II data.14 In the present study, we also found that
African-Americans differed from whites in the way
that certain variables affected weight gain. These
differences may re¯ect cultural beliefs and practices,
or biological factors. On the other hand, they may be
due in part to our inability to separate the effect of a
parity increase of one from that of two or more among
African-Americans (as we did among whites) due to
sample size limitations. The small size of the African-
American sample requires that these results be treated
with caution. No large prospective surveys with mea-
sured weights that include larger samples of African-
Americans are available for analysis or for compar-
ison with our results.

dPredicted probabilities of gaining more than 25 pounds (11.4 kg) for interactions with parity change with a p-value less than 0.10 in a
logistic regression model that included baseline weight, parity, rural-urban residence, employment status, income, education, marital
status, age, age squared, height, y to follow-up, parity change, and interactions between the ®rst eight of these and parity change
(R2  3.7% for whites, R2  13.3% for African-Americans). Although the values in the tables serve to illustrate general trends for the
whole sample, the actual values shown, unless otherwise speci®ed, are those for non-employed, married women residing in
metropolitan areas when the other covariates were set at their centered values.
eEducation, parity and age were examined as continuous variables. Predicted probabilities of gaining more than 25 pounds (11.4 kg)
for three different levels of each are presented in order to show the direction of the interactions.

Age. Among whites, younger compared to older
women were more likely to experience substantial
parity-associated weight gain with a parity increase of
one, while among African-Americans, the opposite
was found. Findings in the literature about the mod-
i®cation of parity-associated weight gain by age are
limited and con¯icting and available only for whites.
One study found that older women retain more weight
postpartum,20 but another found that gestational
weight gain, which is correlated with postpartum
weight retention, tends to be higher in younger than
older women.38
Marital status. The ®nding in this study that white
women who were not married (never married, sepa-
rated/divorced or widowed) tended to gain more
weight over time than those who were married,
especially if they had an increase in parity, might be
explained by the lack of spousal and other social
support for unmarried mothers. Such a situation may
exacerbate parity effects on weight gain by making
exercise and the preparation of healthy meals more
dif®cult. The presence of a spouse may also operate as
a social control mechanism, with encouragement of
postpartum weight loss by the spouse. Greater post-
partum weight retention in unmarried than in married
white women also was reported by Parker and
Abrams16; in contrast, another report14 found greater
parity-associated weight in married women, but only
among 45±74 year olds.
Employment. Our ®nding that being employed
appeared to lessen the effect of a parity increase of
two or more on weight gain among white women
could be attributed to greater concern with body
image among employed women. Swedish women
who returned to work soon after pregnancy also
retained less weight than women who stayed
home.20,39 Similarly, a nationally representative
survey of white women in the US also found an
inverse association between employment and parity-
associated weight.14 Another explanation for the
effect of employment may involve energy expenditure
at work or the structured lifestyle that employment
imposes.
Education and income. Both white and African-Amer-
icanwomenshowedsimilareffectsforeducation:women
with less education had higher risk of substantial weight
gain with an increase in parity than better educated
women. In addition, among African-Americans, lower
income women averaged higher weight gain than women
with higher incomes. These results are consistent with the
®ndings of other studies suggesting that in both whites
and African-Americans, women of lower socioeconomic
status tend to retain more weight postpartum.16 Higher
education may provide knowledge or resource in¯uences
on postpartum weight loss.
Residence. No studies other than the authors' pre-
vious work,14 which also reported greater parity-
associated weight in rural women, could be found to
compare with our ®nding that rural white women with
a parity increase of two or more were more likely than
their metropolitan counterparts to experience substan-
tial weight gain. However, previous studies have
reported both greater weight and greater parity
among rural compared to urban women.41±43 The
isolation and lack of resources in rural areas may
inhibit postpartum weight loss.
Baseline weight. Among African-American women,
parity-associated weight gain was greater in those
with lower baseline weights, while in white women,
the opposite was found for those with a parity increase
of two or more. Other studies have suggested that
women with higher prepregnant weights tend to gain
less during pregnancy38,40 and therefore may retain
less weight postpartum.10
Baseline parity. The ®nding that baseline parity was
inversely related to the risk of substantial weight gain
might re¯ect a history of sizable gains after earlier
births that made women with more children less
predisposed to gain substantial additional weight. A
1990 report found gestational weight gain to be higher
in primiparas than in multiparas.36 However, another
investigation found that African-American women
with higher parity retained more weight postpartum
than those with lower parity, but the study did not
adjust for other variables.16
Smoking. Among both African-Americans with a
parity increase of one or more and white women
with an increase of two or more, parity-associated
weight gain was greater in nonsmokers than in smo-
kers. A similar trend was found in an earlier study of
white women at six months postpartum18 and in a
nationally representative survey of US women.14
Additionally, women who smoke while pregnant
tend to have lower gestational weight gain,11 which
is correlated with postpartum weight retention. How-
ever, among white women in our study whose parity
increased by one child, parity-associated weight gain
was greater in smokers than in nonsmokers. This
unexpected ®nding persisted when outliers were
omitted and when different measures of smoking
(inclusion of imputed values, follow-up values instead
of baseline) were used. It is not clear why women who
had one additional child and smoked gained large
amounts of weight. One possible explanation is that
more smokers who had a parity increase of one, quit
smoking (a variable associated with weight gain for
which we could not control). However, we found that
the percentages who quit smoking were similar across
the parity-change subgroups. It may be that other
unmeasured variables such as stress or intensity of
Parity associated weight gain

808
smoking differed in this subgroup. Our results suggest
that weight, parity and smoking interact in a complex
manner and that further work is needed to understand
these relationships.
Physical activity. Our ®nding that, among white
women, those with moderate or high nonrecreational
physical activity levels were more likely to experience
substantial weight gain with a parity increase of two
or more was unexpected. This ®nding persisted even
after we deleted the most in¯uential cases, but was
eliminated when follow-up, rather than baseline,
values for physical activity were used (about half
the sample changed their reported activity level
between baseline and follow-up). This unexpected
®nding may, in part, be because the questions regard-
ing physical activity were not speci®c to the type or
intensity of activity. There are few studies on the
effect of physical activity on postpartum weight
retention: one study found physical activity to be
inversely related to postpartum weight retention, but
only from 6±12 mo postpartum,39 and another found
an inverse relationship only in African-Americans.14
Physical activity is not thought to affect gestational
weight gain.11
Limitations. The present investigation has several
limitations. Although the sample was large enough
to provide considerable statistical power for whites,
was designed to be nationally representative at the
time the data were collected, and included measured
weights and heights, the sample size for African-
Americans was limited, the data are over 10 y old
and changes may have occurred since that time, and
the results apply only to women who had an increase
in parity after age 25 ± the experience of younger
women may have been different, although adjusting
for the age at which women had their ®rst child did
not change our results. In addition, even for whites the
sample size was not large enough to examine changes
in some of the characteristics over time because of the
limited numbers of women with a change in parity.
Also, the sample size was not large enough to exam-
ine subgroups separately by important variables such
as age and baseline parity, which would have provided
more information than statistically adjusting for them.
A full understanding of this issue would require
measures of additional factors unavailable in this
data set, such as attitudes about weight and ®tness,
social support, and gestational weight gain.
Finally, as in other large epidemiological investiga-
tions, we could not differentiate whether the relation-
ships we found were due to child bearing or child
rearing.13 Future research should include detailed
prospective psychosocial studies and qualitative, in-
depth investigations of parity-associated weight gain.
Conclusion
The amount of weight gain associated with an
increase in parity differed by sociodemographic and
behavioral factors, and these patterns differed between
African-American and white women. Our results
suggest that several groups of women may be at
greater risk for parity-associated weight gain: Afri-
can-Americans, rural residents, those who do not work
outside the home, who have relatively fewer children,
a lower income, are less educated, and/or unmarried,
and nonsmokers. In addition, among white women
speci®cally, those who are younger or who have
higher body weights may be at greater risk. Among
African-American women, those who are older or
who have lower body weights may be at more risk.
Having insights into which women are at risk for
weight gain may help target and design interventions
to prevent postpartum weight retention and obesity in
women.
