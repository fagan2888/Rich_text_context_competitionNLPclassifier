HEALTH CARE REFORM
Impact of Electronic Health Records
on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Blood
Pressure Control at US Primary Care Visits
Prior literature suggests that practice level char-
acteristics mediate racial/ethnic disparities in clini-
cal outcomes.1 One such practice level charac-
teristic, use of electronic health records (EHRs) with
clinical decision support (CDS), has been associated with
improved blood pressure (BP) control in a national study.2
However, we do not know whether these effects differ
across racial/ethnic groups.3 We sought to determine
whether physician use of EHRs with and without CDS
is associated with a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities
in BP control in a nationally representative sample.
Methods. We examined data from primary care visits in
the 2007-2008 National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-
vey (NAMCS), a nationally representative survey of non-
hospital-based ambulatory visits administered by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).4 In a recent
article, we examined visits to NAMCS physicians who
answered questions about EHRs and electronic guideline-
based reminders.2 Primary care visits for patients older
than 20 years with a recorded systolic and diastolic BP
were included, regardless of whether hypertension was
indicated as a diagnosis code, reason for visit, or chronic
condition. We used the race/ethnicity categories and im-
puted values provided by the NCHS.4 In the prior analy-
sis, we controlled for race/ethnicity but did not examine
whether the effect of EHR and/or CDS on BP control dif-
fered across racial/ethnic groups.2
We report herein disparities in BP control as weighted
percentages of visits with BP lower than 140/90 mm Hg.
We stratified visits according to patient race/ethnicity and
physician use of EHRs and/or CDS. We compared BP con-
trol rates for minority patients and white patients whose
physicians were using similar technology. We fit a lo-
gistic regression within each strata, controlling for pa-
tient age, sex, diabetes, insurance type, and practice
ownership. We conducted a secondary analysis for the
one-third of patients with a known diagnosis of hyper-
tension. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS-
callable SUDAAN software (SAS version 9.2 [SAS Insti-
tute Inc] and SUDAAN version 10.0 [RTI International]).
Results. We based our analyses on 17 016 visits, repre-
senting (weighted) 682 million visits nationally. Pa-
tients had a mean age of 51 years, 33% were male, 15%
had diabetes, 34% had hypertension, 64% were non-
Hispanic white, 14% were non-Hispanic black, and 15%
were Hispanic. Overall, 71% of non-Hispanic black pa-
tients had BP control compared with 76% for both His-
panic and non-Hispanic white patients (P.001) after
controlling for patient characteristics and practice own-
ership. Adjusted analyses limited to the known hyper-
tensive subgroup showed similar differences in rates of
BP control between non-Hispanic black (53% of visits)
and non-Hispanic white patients (60% of visits) (P=.004).
Fifteen percent of visits were made to physicians using
only EHRs, 27% to physicians using both EHRs and CDS,
and48%tophysiciansusingneither.Infullyadjustedanaly-
ses stratified by EHR and CDS use, we found improved
BP control for all racial/ethnic groups among patients re-
ceiving care from health care providers using both EHRs
and CDS (Figure). Significant differences in rates of BP
control between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic
white patients persisted in only 1 category, the visits where
physicians used neither EHRs nor CDS (69% vs 75%;
P.001). However, among patients receiving care from
physicians using both EHRs and CDS, Hispanic patients
were significantly more likely to have BP control (85%)
compared with non-Hispanic whites (78%) (P=.001). In
ananalysislimitedtopatientswithhypertension,thesepat-
terns persisted; however, the Hispanic vs non-Hispanic
white difference was not statistically significant.
Comment. To our knowledge, this is the first nationally
representativeexaminationofhowtheeffectofEHRsand/or
CDS on BP control differs across racial/ethnic groups. We
found that previously documented patterns of racial/

ethnic disparities are present among patients whose phy-
sicians are not using EHRs or CDS. However, there is no
disparity between white and black patients whose physi-
ciansuseEHRswithCDS.Furthermore,wefoundthatHis-
panic patients had the greatest change in BP control rates
when their physicians use EHRs with CDS.
Our findings are subject to type II error because we are
interpreting the lack of a statistical difference between
groups as evidence that there is no disparity in BP control
atapopulationlevel.However,ouranalysisisbasedonthou-
sands of sampled visits in each EHR use category. Second,
our analysis was limited by an approximately 30% rate of
imputedrace/ethnicitydata,butNCHSusesvalidatedmeth-
ods to address missing data.5 Third, though we controlled
for practice ownership on the basis of association with both
the exposure and outcome, unmeasured confounding by
physician or practice characteristics is possible. Last, ow-
ing to the cross-sectional study design, we cannot ascer-
tainwhetherEHRswithCDSdecreasedisparitiesorthrough
which mechanism they have an effect (eg, intervening on
physicianbarrierstoguidelineadherence).5 Prospectivetrials
must be conducted to answer these important questions.
Nonetheless, our findings suggest that primary care imple-
mentation of EHRs with CDS may mitigate BP control dis-
parities between whites and blacks, which may in turn re-
duce racial/ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality
from cardiovascular disease.

Primary Health Care Providers' Attitudes
and Counseling Behaviors Related
to Dietary Sodium Reduction
High sodium intake is associated with increased
blood pressure.1 Average sodium intake among
US adults far exceeds recommendations.2 Pri-
mary care physicians and nurse practitioners are the first
line of medical care and can influence opinions and be-
haviors of their patients.3,4 Although some information
exists about perceived advice from health professionals
related to sodium reduction,5 little is known about health
care providers' own perceptions about sodium intake and
patient counseling behaviors about reducing sodium in-
take. We used data from DocStyles, a Web-based survey
of health care providers. Participants included health care
providers who practiced in the United States; worked in
an individual, group, or hospital setting; and had prac-
ticed medicine for a minimum of 3 years. In 2010, family/
general practitioners (FGPs), internists, and nurse prac-
titioners were asked questions on sodium. Response rates
were 45.2% for FGPs and internists combined and 52.6%
for nurse practitioners.
The sodium intake component of this survey con-
sisted of 6 questions assessing health care providers' opin-
ions and perceived counseling behaviors related to
reducing dietary sodium intake. The survey also in-
cluded questions about health care provider character-
istics, including sociodemographic (age, sex, and race/
ethnicity), medical practice (type of practitioner, practice
setting, years of practice, whether they practice at a teach-
ing hospital, and the financial situation of the majority
of their patients), and health-related behavior (self-
