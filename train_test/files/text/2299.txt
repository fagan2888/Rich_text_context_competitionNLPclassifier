Objectives: European countries exhibit significant geographical differences in antibiotic consumption per capita
within ambulatory care, especially inappropriate use for colds/flu/sore throat (CFSt). One potential explanation
could be national cultural differences resulting in varying perceptions and, therefore, influences.
Methods: Publicly available data on the proportions of respondents in the 2009 Eurobarometer survey who had
taken antibiotics for CFSt were tested for association against country scores derived from the Hofstede cultural
dimension model. They were also correlated with knowledge of respondents about various key antibiotic facts.
Results: The Eurobarometer dataset incorporated 26259 responses from all European Union (EU) countries
except Cyprus. Using multiple regression, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity were identified as the two na-
tional cultural dimensions significantly associated with the use of antibiotics for CFSt (R-adjusted¼0.45;
P,0.001). After controlling for these cultural influences, individuals who stated they had received information
about antibiotics in the previous year were also more likely to correctly answer antibiotic-related questions
(r¼0.721; P,0.001). The use of antibiotics for CFSt was found to be inversely correlated with respondents'
knowledge that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses (r¼20.724; P,0.001) and that misuse will render
them ineffective in the longer term (r¼20.775; P,0.001).
Conclusions: National cultural dimensions, especially uncertainty avoidance and masculinity, appear to have a
very significant impact on inappropriate antibiotic use within European countries. Nevertheless, their influence
can be reduced by making EU citizens more knowledgeable about antibiotics through appropriate messages
and targeted campaigns.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance has become a major threat to public health,
and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Accord-
ing to a recent report from the European Centre for Disease
Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency, .25000
patients in the European Union (EU) die each year from infections
caused by multiresistant bacteria.1 Antibiotic use is widely
regarded as a major driver of resistance,2 especially in ambula-
tory care settings; a direct correlation has been clearly
described.3 For this reason, many countries have launched cam-
paigns aimed at increasing awareness among both the general
public as well as the medical and pharmaceutical professions.4
Since 2008, the EU, through the ECDC, has encouraged public
information campaigns on prudent antibiotic use in its member
countries, by promoting a European Antibiotic Awareness Day
(EAAD) on the 18 November.5 Nevertheless, concerns have
been raised that such campaigns are not having their anticipated
effect.6,7
There is a significant difference in antibiotic consumption per
capita between European countries.8 Interestingly, this variation
has a clear geographical pattern. Northern Scandinavian
countries exhibit the lowest level of use, whereas the southern
Mediterranean countries are consistently among the highest
consumers in the EU.9 Surprisingly, only a few studies have con-
sidered that this could be significantly influenced by cultural
factors.10
Hofstede's model of cultural dimensions is one of the most
popular approaches to analyse cultural differences between
countries, with .9000 citations in peer-reviewed journals. It
defines culture as the collective programming of the mind that
distinguishes the members of one group or category of people

from another. Using data analysis from thousands of detailed
interviews, conducted in 53 countries, Geert Hofstede has formu-
lated a model showing that world cultures vary along consistent,
fundamental dimensions, which can be grouped into specific
constructs: power distance (PDI), individualism (IND), masculinity
(MAS), uncertainty avoidance (UAI), long-term (versus short-
term) orientation (LTO) and indulgence versus restraint (IVR)
(Figure 1).11,12 Each dimension carries a designated score,
which varies from country to country. Therefore, it is possible
to undertake correlation analysis with behavioural statistics to
ascertain possible cultural influences.
In 2010, the European Commission published a Eurobarom-
eter study that had been carried out between 13 November
and 9 December 2009 within all 27 EU countries. The survey
covered residents aged 15 years in each country. The basic
design, identically applied to all countries, was a multistage,
random probability assessment using a number of sampling
points proportional to the population size. These data are freely
accessible for use and further evaluation.13
Methods
For the purpose of the study, Eurobarometer data were extracted and
related to the proportion of respondents, by country, who replied
correctly to four questions assessing their knowledge that antibiotics:
are not active against viruses; do not work on colds and flu; can
become ineffective if used unnecessarily; and their use can potentially
be associated with serious side effects. Also noted were the respective
proportions of respondents, by country, who stated that they had
taken at least one course of antibiotics in the previous year for colds/
flu/sore throat (CFSt). Lastly, the proportion of respondents in each
country who said that they had received information in the previous
year about the importance of using antibiotics correctly was identified.
Individual scores for PDI, IND, MAS, UAI, LTO and IVR were accessed
for each EU country from http://www.geerthofstede.nl/research--vsm/
dimension-data-matrix.aspx. These scores were then correlated, by
country, with the proportion of respondents who had taken antibiotics
for CFSt. Multiple linear regression models were built in order to establish
overall relationships; these were carried out using the backward stepwise
technique utilizing, as the dependent variables, the proportions of people
who had taken an antibiotic for CFSt. The adequacy of the models was
confirmed through analysis of variance, the Durbin­Watson test for
autocorrelation and collinearity diagnostics. Analyses were performed
using Medcalc, version 9.2.1.0 (Medcalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium)
and SPSS, version 15 (SPSS Inc., USA). A P value of 0.05 was taken to
indicate statistical significance.
Pearson correlation analysis was then undertaken between the pro-
portion of individuals per country who stated they had received informa-
tion about antibiotics in the previous year and the proportion of
individuals who correctly answered all four antibiotic knowledge ques-
tions. Individual tests of association between the use of antibiotics for
CFSt and correct reply to each of the four antibiotic questions were
also performed. These were then repeated, but controlled for any cultural
dimensions that were previously retained in the multiple regression
model.
Results
Data were extracted for all EU countries participating in the 2009
Eurobarometer survey, with the exception of Cyprus, for which no
Hofstede dimensional scores were available. These incorporated
a total of 26259 responses (Table 1). The percentage of
individuals who indicated that they had taken antibiotics for
CFSt in the previous 12 months varied from 11% in Finland to
81% in Spain.
Significant correlations for inappropriate antibiotic use in CFSt
were seen on univariate analysis with several Hofstede cultural
dimensions, namely UAI, MAS, IND and IVR. However, the
multiple regression model retained only UAI and MAS
(R-adjusted¼0.45; P,0.001) as significantly associated vari-
ables (Table 2).
Individuals who stated they had received information about
antibiotics in the previous year were more likely to answer all
four antibiotic knowledge questions correctly (uncontrolled:
r¼0.578, P¼0.002; controlled for UAI and MAS: r¼0.721,
P,0.001). Furthermore, the proportions of respondents per
country who answered all four antibiotic knowledge questions
correctly were also found to be inversely correlated with the
proportions who took antibiotics for CFSt (Table 3).
The use of antibiotics for CFSt was inversely associated at an
individual level with knowledge that antibiotics are ineffective
against viruses and that they do not work against colds and
flu, as well as with awareness of the long-term impact of un-
necessary use. However, when the correlation analysis was con-
trolled for UAI and MAS country scores, only knowledge about
Power distance (PDI) relates to the extent to which the less powerful
members of organizations and institutions accept and expect that
power is distributed unequally. It suggests that a society's level of
inequality is endorsed by the followers as much as by the leaders.
Uncertainty avoidance (UAI) indicates to what extent a society
tolerates uncertainty and ambiguity, and shows how comfortable its
members feel in unstructured situations that are novel, unknown,
surprising or different from usual.
Individualism (IND) is the degree to which individuals are integrated
into groups.
Masculinity (MAS) refers to the distribution of emotional roles
between the genders. Masculine dimensions are very assertive and
competitive.
Long-term orientation (LTO) fosters pragmatic virtues oriented
towards future rewards; in particular, saving, persistence and
adapting to changing circumstances.
Indulgence (IVR) stands for a society that allows relatively free
gratification of basic and natural human drives related to enjoying life
and having fun.

Discussion
Antibiotic campaigns can be quite expensive initiatives. The
French campaign run between 2002 and 2007 has been reported
to have cost E100 million over the 6 years.14 Even though signifi-
cantly cheaper, the Belgian campaign still cost E400000 a
year.15 In both cases, the reduction in antibiotic consumption
rendered the investment cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is not a
straightforward assumption to anticipate that decision-makers
will immediately sign off requests for funding of such national
initiatives. Indeed, financial support in EU countries, even just
for the activities of the annual EAAD, has been far from univer-
sal.5 It is therefore essential to establish a robust cross-national
evidence base within Europe that validates the effectiveness of
these initiatives within the region.
The results of this study clearly show that European citizens
who have been exposed to information about antibiotics, and
their appropriate use, are more knowledgeable about the
subject. In turn, they are less likely to take antibiotics unneces-
sarily for respiratory infections of probable viral origin. The
same Eurobarometer survey reported that 96% of EU inhabitants
took antibiotics only following a prescription by a medical practi-
tioner. Public campaigns equally impact on doctors and influence
their prescribing habits.16 In fact, the model identified no correl-
ation between use for CFSt and PDI, a change from an earlier
study that had used data collected before the EAAD and other
antibiotic campaigns were introduced in Europe.17 This could
suggest that the recent EAAD and other campaigns may be influ-
encing prescribing by empowering patients to resist unnecessary
antibiotic prescriptions for CFSt from their doctors. Indeed, inter-
ventional strategies that improve doctor­patient communica-
tion and patient empowerment have been shown to be
effective in reducing primary care antibiotic prescriptions.18
However, antibiotic campaigns have not been universally
successful in all countries. Unlike in France and Belgium, national
campaigns in other countries failed to show a significant reduc-
tion in antibiotic prescriptions.7,19 Cultural differences could
potentially explain some of these and other geographical differ-
ences in antibiotic use between European countries. Indeed,
national UAI and MAS constructs can explain almost half of
the variation of inappropriate use of antibiotics for CFSt reported
in the Eurobarometer survey. UAI has already been suggested as
a potential driver for unnecessary antibiotic use.17 It would
appear to be a logical choice. Mediterranean countries are
among the largest users of antibiotics in Europe and also
exhibit some of the highest UAI scores. High UAI nations
exhibit a general intolerance of ambiguity and uncertainty. It is
to be expected that patients in these countries are likely to
find difficulty in accepting a recommendation to manage a
viral upper respiratory infection simply through rest and symp-
tomatic therapy. Physicians in high UAI countries are equally
likely to feel uncomfortable when faced with a variety of mild
symptoms, such as fever, cough and sore throat, and the
diagnostic difficulty to fully exclude a potential, albeit unlikely,
bacterial aetiology.20 In such circumstances, antibiotics offer a
psychological assurance in a situation of uncertainty to both
patient and prescriber. There is already some evidence that
would support this hypothesis. Harbarth et al.21 reported signifi-
cant differences in public perspectives, prescriber attitudes and
levels of antibiotic use between Germany (UAI¼65) and France
(UAI¼86). Similarly, differences in attitudes towards infections
and antibiotic use have been noted between Flemish Belgians
and Dutch residents just over the border in the Netherlands.22
The former has one of the highest UAI scores in Europe,
whereas the Dutch have one of the lowest. On the other hand,
the association with MAS is a novel and very interesting
finding. It could provide a possible sociocultural explanation for
the relative failure of antibiotic campaigns in parts of the UK,23
as well as the high level of ambulatory care antibiotic consump-
tion in the USA.24 Both countries score low on UAI, but very high
on MAS. Countries with high MAS have a strong work ethos and
their citizens are often described as `living to work'. In such
environments, antibiotics would be incorrectly regarded as vital
medicines to get back to work as quickly as possible. This
demand could then plausibly influence the prescriber, overtly
or otherwise.25
The inclusion of cultural factors into antibiotic-related behav-
iour throws up a number of ponderables. National cultural
dimensions are reputed to have been formed from core values
in societies, which have evolved over hundreds, if not thousands,
of years.11 It will not be easy to change such behaviour in the
short or medium term. However, the success in France suggests
that improvement is possible, even in countries with a high UAI
score. It should, nevertheless, be noted that after almost a
decade of campaigns costing many millions of euros, France
continues to be the third highest antibiotic consumer per
capita in Europe.9 In addition, antibiotic prescribing for respira-
tory infections that carry more aetiological and therapeutic
uncertainty, such as bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media and tonsil-
litis, showed little or no difference after the campaign.26
One possible way to address UAI is by adopting strategies that
eliminate or, at least, reduce uncertainty in the population being
targeted. Rapid near-patient tests for Streptococcus pyogenes
offer significant promise, as they provide a visual assurance for
both patient and doctor that the pharyngitis is not being
caused by a bacterial infection. Indeed, a recent publication
showed a moderate reduction in prescribing using this approach
in Spain, another high UAI country.27 It has been recommended
that campaign messages need to be clear and simple, and that
negative, fear-inducing statements should be avoided.28 Above
all, this study suggests that they also must be conducive with
the culture of the country where they are applied. A message
that the best remedy for colds and flu is just to rest at home
has been commonly used in past EAAD campaigns;4,5 however,
it is not synchronous with high UAI and MAS cultures. On the
other hand, an incontrovertible factual statement that viruses
are not killed by antibiotics, and that their use will therefore
not reduce the duration of illness, may be more assimilable
and effective in such cultural backgrounds.
The greatest strength of this study was the extensive, and
possibly unmatched, power offered by the Eurobarometer set
of data. No previous European survey on antibiotic perceptions
and practices has incorporated .26000 respondents and genu-
inely encompassed the whole of the EU, stratified in terms of
metropolitan, urban and rural areas. Eurobarometer data have
very low whole-country confidence intervals, ranging from only
Borg
766
+1.9% for responses between 10% and 90% up to a maximum
of +3.1% for an observed proportion of 50%.13 This supported
accurate correlations. In addition, it concentrated on inappropri-
ate use rather than total prescriptions, which is what many
studies have looked at in the past.4 The most important limita-
tion was the same as that of any other study of association:
correlation does not automatically infer causality. Nevertheless,
cultural dimensions evolve from the core values of a society
and easily pre-date modern medicine by centuries. It is logical
to conclude that it is these fundamental values that then give
rise to rituals, such as antibiotic-related perceptions and
practices.
In conclusion, following analysis of published Eurobarometer
data, this study suggests that cultural dimensions, especially
UAI and MAS, may be significantly responsible for variations in
the inappropriate ambulatory care use of antibiotics within
European countries. Furthermore, they support a hypothesis
that EU citizens who have been exposed to more information
about antibiotics exhibit greater knowledge on the subject. In
turn, they are less likely to take antibiotics unnecessarily for
CFSt. Awareness that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses
and that misuse will render them ineffective in the longer term
seem to be particularly relevant. These inferences can prove
useful to design better and more effective antibiotic campaigns
in European countries.
