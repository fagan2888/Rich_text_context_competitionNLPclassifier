The Nonpoor Uninsured In
California, 1998
If those who can afford to buy health insurance choose not to, what are the
implications for our voluntary system of coverage?

Lack of insurance is not solely an
issue for the poor. In both California
and the nation, approximately 40 per-
cent of the uninsured have family incomes of
at least twice the federal poverty level, and
one-quarter have family incomes of at least
300 percent of poverty.1 Examining the issue
from this perspective does not detract from
the importance of ensuring that those with
the least means in our society obtain health
insurance and better access to care. However,
it does evoke questions about the point at
which health insurance is the responsibility of
the individual rather than of society.
Nationally, the vast majority (80 percent)
of the nonpoor (persons with incomes above
200 percent of poverty) obtain health insur-
ance through employment, but a significant
minority are self-employed, work for a firm
that does not offer coverage, or turn down
employer-offered coverage.2 For these persons
(and their dependents), the main options are
to purchase individual health insurance or to
remain uninsured. About 7 percent purchase
individual insurance (35 percent of those not
covered through employment); the remainder
go without coverage. Interestingly, and some-
what surprisingly, those at 200­299 percent
of poverty are just as likely to purchase indi-
vidual health insurance as are those with in-
comes above 400 percent of poverty.3
The nonpoor are not strong candidates for
public insurance programs or significant pre-
mium subsidies. Only five states have ex-
panded health insurance premium subsidies
to adults with incomes greater than 200 per-
cent of the federal poverty level, and there is
no serious discussion of doing so at the na-
tional level.4 As a society, we assume that per-
sons at this income level will voluntarily pur-
chase health insurance, and many of them do.
Why don't all of them do so? Are they worried
about being uninsured? How do they get ac-
cess to the medical care system, and at what
cost? Would they consider purchasing cover-
age? Answers to these questions will help to
inform the discussion about the potential for
expanding coverage within the current volun-
tary system.
Characteristics Of The Nonpoor
Uninsured
In fall 1998 the Field Research Corporation
undertook a random-digit-dial screening to
identify California adults meeting two crite-
ria: uninsured and with household incomes of
at least 200 percent of the federal poverty
level (approximately 9 percent of California's
population).5 Telephone interviews were con-
ducted in English and Spanish with 1,009 re-
spondents, to collect information on atti-
tudes, utilization and charges, perception of

the cost of health insurance premiums, and
willingness to pay.6
The sample that we interviewed was pre-
dominantly male, white, and under age forty
(Exhibit 1).7 In spite of the income floor of 200
percent of poverty, this group was not afflu-
ent. More than one-third had annual house-
hold incomes below $30,000, and only 10 per-
cent had household incomes of $75,000 or
more. Nonetheless, 40 percent of the sample
reported owning their own homes, and more
than half owned a personal computer. Sixty
percent reported being in excellent or very
good health, and 12 percent, fair or poor
health.8 Eleven percent had experienced a se-
rious medical condition in the past year, and 5
percent reported having been denied insur-
ance coverage because of a medical condition.9
A large majority of the respondents (81 per-
cent) were employed (63 percent full time, 18
percent part time). Twenty percent worked
for an employer that offered health benefits;
among those respondents, half were eligible
for coverage.10 Among this 10 percent, cost
was the predominant reason for declining
coverage but was cited by fewer than 40 per-
cent. More than 90 percent of respondents
had purchased some form of insurance in the
past; most common was automobile insur-
ance (90 percent), followed by home-

owners'/renters' coverage (46 percent) and
life insurance (37 percent).
Health Care Use And Charges
Fifty-four percent of respondents reported at
least one visit to a medical facility or health
professional in the past year (Exhibit 2). Of
those who obtained any medical services or
prescriptions, the median out-of-pocket
charge was $200, while the mean was $1,083.
The difference between the two values indi-
cates that although most of the uninsured are
obtaining relatively few services at a relatively
low cost, a small proportion are high users
with a heavy associated financial burden.
Among the 54 percent reporting one or
more medical visits, 84 percent were charged
for at least some of those services. Of those
charged, 81 percent reported paying the entire
bill, and only 6 percent said that they paid
nothing. Almost half (46 percent) of those
with outstanding charges were continuing to
pay in installments.
Attitudes Toward Insurance
To assess attitudes toward health insurance,
respondents were read a series of statements
and asked whether they agreed or disagreed,
strongly or somewhat (Exhibit 3). Four state-
ments explored each respondent's degree of
worry--for themselves, for their families, re-
lated to health (obtaining proper medical
care), and related to finances (being wiped
out financially). Consistently, 60 percent
agreed that they worried a lot about each of
these issues; those with higher incomes were
less likely to be concerned, as were those with
better health status. About 20 percent dis-
agreed strongly with these statements (that
is, they do not worry at all).
Despite this fairly high degree of worry, the
majority (57 percent) of respondents dis-
agreed with the statement, "Health insurance
ranks very high on my list of priorities for
where to spend my money." One explanation
may lie in respondents' perceived value of
health insurance: 43 percent agreed with the
statement, "Health insurance is not a very
good value for the money."
The complexity of the delivery system does
not appear to be a barrier to purchasing cover-
age. Only 10 percent of respondents agreed
strongly that "getting health care through a
health insurance plan is too complicated for
me," while 46 percent disagreed strongly.
Cost And Willingness To Pay
The survey included questions about respon-
dents' perception of the cost of "a basic health
insurance plan" and willingness to pay for
coverage.11 Overall, respondents believed that
health insurance cost about twice as much as

they were willing to pay: the median per-
ceived monthly cost was $100, compared with
the willingness-to-pay median of $50. Per-
ceived cost increased with age, accurately re-
flecting the fact that age is a standard rating
factor in California's individual market (a me-
dian of $80 for those ages nineteen to twenty-
nine, compared with a median of $200 for
those ages fifty to sixty-four).
To compare perceived cost and willing-
ness-to-pay responses with the actual cost of
health insurance, responses to both questions
were indexed to premiums of various individ-
ual (nongroup) insurance products actually
offered by California health plans in 1998.
Since the cost of health insurance varies con-
siderably by age and geography, the cost cited
by each respondent was indexed to what that
person would have had to pay for a particular
type of plan based on age and county of resi-
dence. Costs were calculated for three types
of individual insurance products available in
the California market: a $10 copayment for
physician visits, a $40 copayment for physi-
cian visits, and a $2,000 deductible. Actual
costs that each respondent would have had to
pay for each product were calculated by aver-
aging 1998 published rates for each type of
product across the three major health plans in
California's individual market (only two of
the three offer high-copayment and high-
deductible products). Note that each respon-
dent gave a single answer to each of the two
questions (perceived cost and willingness to
pay); that response was indexed to premiums
for all three health insurance products.12
Respondents' perceptions of cost often ex-
ceeded the actual cost, especially for the
lower-premium plans (Exhibit 4). One-third
of the respondents perceived the cost of a "ba-
sic health insurance plan for yourself" as 20
percent or more over what they would actu-
ally have had to pay in premiums for insur-
ance with a $10 copayment for physician of-

fice visits; two-thirds perceived the cost as 20
percent or more over what they would have
had to pay for the $40 copayment plan or the
$2,000 deductible plan.
A smaller percentage of respondents (27
percent) reported being willing to pay an
amount that was either close to--or 20 per-
cent or more over--the actual cost of the $10
copayment plan. Slightly more than half re-
ported the same willingness to pay for the $40
copayment plan. Indexing the willingness-to-
pay responses to the high-deductible product
produces results virtually identical to those
for the $40 copayment product because the
two sets of premiums are very similar.
The survey then briefly described each of
the insurance options and asked respondents
whether they would purchase the three types
of health insurance products at their actual
(age- and county-specific) premiums. Only
highly simplified descriptions could be given
for products whose benefit features vary
greatly, but responses give a general sense of
the level of interest. A majority (53 percent)
reported that they would buy at least one of
the three options. Of the 53 percent, about
half preferred the $40 copayment plan; the
$2,000 deductible product was the least pre-
ferred. There was little difference in responses
across income categories.
A limitation of this analysis is that premi-
ums may vary with health status in Califor-
nia's individual health insurance market; per-
sons responding to the questions about cost
and willingness to pay may actually be
charged a premium that is different from the
standard rates used here. However, two fac-
tors ameliorate this limitation. First, age,
which reflects health status to some extent,
was incorporated into this analysis since it is
a standard factor used by the health plans in
setting rates. Second, 60 percent of the sample
reported being in excellent or very good
health. Restricting the analysis to this portion
of the sample--those most likely to be ac-
cepted by health plans under their standard
rates--produces results virtually identical to
those described above and shown in Exhibit 4.
Policy Implications
Misperceptions about the cost of health in-
surance or lack of awareness of the full range
of options that exist in the individual market
may be a significant factor in the lack of health
insurance for some nonpoor Californians. To
the extent that such persons perceive the cost
of health insurance to be out of reach, they are
unlikely to pursue its purchase. Correcting

inaccurate perceptions of cost or educating
about the full array of products available may
bring new consumers into the health insur-
ance market, reducing the number of unin-
sured. Although willingness-to-pay responses
are known to overstate actual purchasing be-
havior, it is encouraging to note that more than
half of respondents said that they would buy
at least one of three types of health insurance
at premiums adjusted for age and geography.
n Plan preferences. Respondents
strongly preferred the $40 copayment plan
when presented with the premiums for all three
options. This is consistent with anecdotal evi-
dence from industry leaders that consumers
prefer high-copayment plans to high-deduct-
ible plans. From the consumer's perspective,
premiums paid for the high-deductible cover-
age appear to be wasted when (as is usually
the case) the deductible is not reached. It is
also consistent with the spending patterns of
this sample: Only a few respondents reported
significant health care use, which would ren-
der the low-copayment (high-premium) plan
less attractive.
n Cost versus value. The good news is
that health plans that actively educate the
nonpoor uninsured about the array of prod-
ucts and prices available in the individual
market may persuade some of them to buy.
Less encouraging is that premiums in Califor-
nia's individual market have risen by approxi-
mately 20 percent since the survey was con-
ducted.13 Persons will purchase insurance
when they perceive that it has value commen-
surate with its cost. More than 40 percent of
respondents to this survey felt that health in-
surance is not a good value; this proportion
can only go up as prices increase. Careful at-
tention should be paid to regulatory meas-
ures, such as benefit mandates, that may add
significant cost but little value for many po-
tential enrollees.14 The question is not
whether more benefits are better, but rather
how many people will be priced out of the
market.
n Voluntarism versus universalism.
Even if every respondent who said that they
would purchase one of the products did so,
almost half of the sample would remain unin-
sured. A closer look at this half reveals two
distinct groups. One group is quite concerned
about lacking coverage but is close to the in-
come floor of 200 percent of poverty; this
group might be expected to respond to indi-
vidually based tax incentives to lower the price
of purchasing insurance that are currently un-
der discussion.15 However, the majority have
higher incomes but are unworried and thus
unlikely to enter the market voluntarily.16
If those whom society has implicitly
deemed financially able to participate in the
health insurance market choose not to, what
are the implications for our voluntary system
of coverage? There has been little mention of
compulsory participation in our health insur-
ance system since 1994, when all flavors of
mandates and taxes were considered in pur-
suit of universal coverage.17 In the reemerging
discussion, attention has focused on individ-
ual rather than employer mandates to provide
workers with coverage.18 An individual ap-
proach fits logically with a tax-incentive ap-
proach and is aligned with increasing move-
ment toward individual choice and defined
contribution. But while the locus has shifted
to the individual, the underlying theme from
1994 recurs: the inherent contradiction be-
tween voluntarism and universalism. This pa-
per confirms that while some nonpoor unin-
sured persons may be persuaded to purchase
insurance through more-effective education
and marketing, any system that relies on indi-
viduals to purchase insurance voluntarily will
fall far short of universal coverage.

5. We were unable to ascertain, during the short
field period, the total number of persons eligible
for the survey; thus, potential nonresponse bias
does not allow us to make statistical inferences
about the nonpoor uninsured population in Cali-
fornia. Nevertheless, these interviews provide a
rich source of data that describe this population
and generate hypotheses about the important
factors in the decision making of nonpoor per-
sons with respect to health insurance.

Social Research (ICPSR), based at the Univer-
sity of Michigan (www.icpsr.umich.edu), Study
no. 2688.
7. While the age and employment makeup of the
nonpoor uninsured population is similar to that
of California's uninsured population overall, the
latter is much more likely to be nonwhite (68
percent, compared with 35 percent for the non-
poor uninsured). Brown et al., The Uninsured in
California, 5­8.
8. These figures are consistent with 1997 national
data on the uninsured overall (62 percent excel-
lent/very good and 10 percent fair/poor). Nation-
ally, in terms of health status, the uninsured fall
between those with private coverage (73 percent
excellent/very good and 6 percent fair/poor) and
those with public coverage only (54 percent ex-
cellent/very good and 19 percent fair/poor).

Agency for Health Care Policy and Research,
1999).
9. We also conducted telephone interviews with
802 individually insured California adults with
household incomes of at least 200 percent of
poverty. In comparison with the nonpoor unin-
sured, the individually insured were older (forty-
two versus thirty-six), less ethnically diverse (79
percent white), more likely to be women (61 per-
cent), and had higher incomes (47 percent versus
24 percent had household incomes of at least 500
percent of poverty). They also were more likely
to report excellent or very good health status (75
percent versus 60 percent).
10. Reasons for being ineligible might include part-
time or temporary status, or a waiting period
between beginning employment and becoming
eligible for benefits.
11. The question about perceived cost of premiums
was worded: "How much do you think it would
cost you to purchase a basic health insurance
plan for yourself...Just very roughly, what would
be the monthly cost if you wanted health insur-
ance?" The willingness-to-pay question was
worded: "How much, if anything, would you be
willing to pay each month out of your own
pocket for a health insurance plan that provided
basic coverage for doctor visits, hospitalization,
and prescription drugs for yourself?"
12. For the $10 copayment plan, average premium
values used for indexing were as follows: ages
19­29, $80­$90; 30­39, $110­$120; 40­49,
$135­$150; 50­59, $160­$185; 60­64, $190­$215.
For the $40 copayment plan, average premium
values were ages 19­29, $30­$50; 30­39,
$45­$75; 40­49, $70­$115; 50­59, $120­$165;
60­64, $145­$205. Average premium ranges for
the $2,000 deductible plan were identical to the
$40 copayment plan with two exceptions: ages
40­49, $70­$110; and 60­64, $140­$200. The
range for each age group is due to variation in
premium across geographical regions.
