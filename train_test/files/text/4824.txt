Abstract
Objective: To determine serum concentrations of soluble CD95 ligand (sCD95L) in patients with
traumatic spinal cord injury.
Methods: Patients with traumatic spinal cord injury were recruited. Blood was collected on
admission to hospital and at 4 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 days, 7 days, and 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks
postadmission. Serum concentrations of sCD95L were determined via immunoassay.
Result: The study included 23 patients. Mean sCD95L concentrations were significantly lower at
4 h, 9 h, 12 h and 24 h than at admission, and were significantly higher at 8 and 12 weeks, compared
with admission.
Conclusion: The serum sCD95L concentration fell significantly during the first 24 h after
traumatic spinal cord injury. Concentrations then rose, becoming significantly higher than
admission levels at 8 weeks. sCD95L may represent a possible therapeutic target for traumatic
spinal cord injury.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury has an enormous impact
on health-related quality-of-life due to its
substantial medical, psychological and eco-
nomic consequences for patients and their
families.1 Despite advances in its treatment,
there is no therapy capable of effectively
reversing neurological damage.2
The acute phase of spinal cord injury lasts
up to 2 days and is characterized by inflam-
mation, neuronal and axonal changes,
haemorrhage, demyelination and apop-
tosis.3,4 Apoptosis plays an important role
in the progressive destruction of grey and
white matter5­8 characterized by ischaemia,
inflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxi-
dative stress and the production of free
radicals.3 This cascade leads to the destruc-
tion of neurons by both necrotic and
apoptotic cell death, increasing the damage
that was initially produced by traumatic
injury.9
The type II transmembrane protein
CD95L can be proteolytically cleaved into
a membrane-bound (mCD95L) and a sol-
uble (sCD95L) form.10 sCD95L is activated
and secreted by cleavage of mCD95L by the
serine matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-7
and MMP-3.11 Binding of CD95L to CD95
(Fas) leads to trimerization of the intracel-
lular death domain and binding of FADD
(Fas-associated protein with death domain).
This leads to caspase-8 activation and for-
mation of DISC (death-inducing signalling
complex). Caspase-8 autoproteolysis results
in activation of effector caspases (caspase-3
and -7), inducing a mitochondrial apoptosis
signal and death signal amplification.12­14
Binding of CD95L to CD95 also leads to
production of inflammatory cytokines.15
CD95 also has effects on cellular activation,
differentiation and proliferation,14 and is
involved in the branching of developing
neurons in the CNS, axonal sprouting of
dorsal root ganglion neurons, migration of
malignant glioma cells, and differentiation
of neuronal stem cells.16
Blocking the CD95 pathway (via sub-
arachnoid infusion of sFasR,17 systemic
antibody administration18 or genome dele-
tion19) has been found to improve functional
outcome and reduce apoptotic cell death
following spinal cord injury in rodents.17 The
findings of these studies may not be applic-
able to humans, although a similar pattern of
inflammatory cytokine production was seen
in rodent spinal cords and human cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) following spinal cord
injury.20 Our pilot study of patients with
spinal cord injury revealed an initial increase
followed by a decrease in blood sCD95L
concentrations, but the sample size was
insufficient to show statistical significance.21
The aim of the current study, therefore, was
to evaluate sCD95L levels in a larger cohort
of patients with spinal cord injury, to deter-
mine whether sCD95L could be used as a
therapeutic target.
Patients and methods
The study included all patients with acute
spinal cord injury who were treated at the BG
Trauma Centre Ludwigshafen, Department
of Paraplegiology, Ludwigshafen, Germany,
between November 2010 and January 2013.
Exclusion criteria were: nontraumatic spinal
injury; brain injury; infectious disease;
rheumatological conditions; endocrino-
logical disease; cancer; autoimmune condi-
tions; coma. Injuries were classified using
the AO classification system.22
The study was approved by the Ethics
Commission of the Landesa
¨ rztekammer
Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany (No.
837.188.12 (8289-F)), and all participants
provided written informed consent prior to
inclusion in the study.
Blood samples
Venous blood (7.5 ml) was taken using
standard methods on admission to hos-
pital, and at 4 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 days, 7
Biglari et al. 251
days, and 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after
injury. Blood was allowed to coagulate
for 20 min, then centrifuged at 2500 g for
10 min at room temperature, and the
resulting serum was stored at À80C until
analysis.
sCD95L quantification
Serum sCD95L was quantified using the
QuantikineÕ Human Fas Ligands/TNFSF6
Immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Analysis was performed in
duplicate in a double-blind manner.
Normal reference values for sCD95L are
39.8­145 pg/ml.
Neurological examination
Neurological deficit was classified accord-
ing to the International Standards for
Neurological Classification of SCI.23
Neurological examinations were con-
ducted in awake and responsive
patients at admission and discharge (after
12 weeks).
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were expressed as
mean Æ SD or SEM; categorical data were
expressed as absolute and relative rates.
Independent variables were analysed using
Mann­Whitney U-test; dependent variables
were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. A test for normal distribution between
groups was not used because of the small
patient pool. Between-group comparisons of
categorical data were made with 2-test.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ; graphs were created
using SigmaPlotÕ Software (Systat
Software, San Jose, CA, USA). P-values
<0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study included 23 patients (16[69.6%]
male/ seven [30.4%] female; mean age
42.9Æ23.11 years; age range 18­85 years).
Seven patients showed improvements in
neurological deficit between arrival and dis-
charge, 16 had no neurological improve-
ment and no patient had a worsening in
condition. Full clinical and demographic
details of the patient cohort are given in
Table 1.
Data regarding mean serum sCD95L
concentrations at all timepoints are given
in Table 2. Mean sCD95L concentrations
were significantly lower at 4 h, 9 h, 12 h, and
24 h than at admission (P<0.05 for each
comparison; Table 2). sCD95L concentra-
tions were significantly higher at 8 and 12

weeks compared with admission (P < 0.05
for each comparison; Table 2).
There were no significant differences in
sCD95L concentration at any timepoint
between patients with grade A injuries
(n ¼ 13) and those with grade B/C (n ¼ 10)
(data not shown).
Discussion
The present study found that serum concen-
trations of sCD95L significantly decreased
in the first 24h after hospital admission,
compared with initial levels. sCD95L con-
centrations then gradually increased,
becoming significantly higher than admis-
sion at 8 weeks. These findings are in
accordance with those of our pilot study21
and the work of others.24
It is well documented that blocking the
sCD95L signalling pathway leads to an
improvement in neurological deficit after
spinal cord injury.17­19,25,26 In rats, CD95
concentrations in white brain matter
increase in the first 8 h following injury.27
There was a significant fall in sCD95L
concentration immediately after injury in
humans in the present study, followed by an
increase after 24 h. It is possible that block-
ing the CD95 signalling pathway in its
earliest phase might be therapeutically
effective. More precise temporal informa-
tion concerning sCD95L concentration is
needed in order to determine the timepoint
when a goal-oriented therapy would be most
effective in paitents with acute spinal cord
injury. Studies concerning cytokine expres-
sionhave shown that rodents and humans
release the same inflammatory cytokines
after traumatic injury to the spinal cord,
though they were detectable later in human
CSF than in mice.20 This may explain the
differences observed between human and
animal studies relating to the timing of
changes in CD95L concentration.
A postmortem human study found that
the CD95/CD95L system was involved in
both apoptosis and inflammatory response
in the acute and subacute phases after spinal
cord injury,28 and that both proapoptotic
and proinflammatory activity were function-
ally important. The role of autoimmunity is
unclear, with some studies indicating a
neurotoxic effect29­31 and others a neuro-
protective one.32 It remains to be elucidated
whether there are different roles for the
soluble and membrane-bound forms of
CD95L. T-cells from mice lacking CD95
were unable to kill targeted cells, suggesting
that mCD95L is responsible for cytotoxic
activity and initiating apoptosis, rather than
for immunological activity.33 Mice injected
with sCD95L developed an autoimmune
response,34 but others have shown that
mCD95L confers autoimmune activity.10
Some studies have shown that recombinant
sCD95L, in contrast to human sCD95L, has
no effect on apoptosis.10,35 In this context,
the relationship between neurological out-
come and sCD95L concentration in a larger
cohort population would be of interest. Our
study showed no significant difference in

serum sCD95L concentration between
patients with, or without, an improved
neurological outcome. This is most likely
due to the small number of patients after
stratification according to American Spinal
Injury Association Impairment Scale
grades.36 The current study has several
limitations, most notably the absence of a
control group comprising patients with ver-
tebral bone fracture and without neuro-
logical deficit. This is due to the
considerably shorter hospitalization of
such control patients. A further limitation
is the short duration of follow-up; a longer
follow-up would be interesting but is diffi-
cult to manage. Finally, it would be of
interest to compare sCD95L and mCD95L
concentrations. Furthermore, properly con-
trolled, larger-scale studies are required to
support our findings.
In conclusion, the serum sCD95L con-
centration falls significantly during the first
24 h after traumatic spinal cord injury.
sCD95L concentrations then rise, becoming
significantly higher than admission levels at
8 weeks. sCD95L may represent a possible
therapeutic target for traumatic spinal cord
injury.
