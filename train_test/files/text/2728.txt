Abstract
Background: South Africa is experiencing a health and social transition including an age-
ing population and an HIV epidemic. We report mortality experience of an older rural
South African population.
Methods: Individual survey data and longer-term demographic data were used to de-
scribe factors associated with mortality. Individuals aged 50 years and over (n ¼ 4085) an-
swered a health and quality of life questionnaire in 2006 and were followed for 3 years
thereafter. Additional vital events and socio-demographic data were extracted from the
Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System from 1993 to 2010, to provide
longer-term trends in mortality. Cox regression analysis was used to determine factors
related to survival.
Results: In 10 967 person-years of follow-up between August 2006 and August 2009,
377 deaths occurred. Women had lower mortality {hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 0.28­0.45]}. Higher mortality was associated with being single
[HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.16­1.88)], having lower household assets score [HR 1.79 (95%
CI 1.28­2.51)], reporting greater disability [HR 2.40 (95% CI 1.68­3.42)] and poorer qual-
ity of life [HR 1.59 (95% CI 1.09­2.31)]. There was higher mortality in those aged
under 69 as compared with those 70 to 79 years old. Census data and cause specific
regression models confirmed that this was due to deaths from HIV/TB in the younger age
group.

Conclusions: Mortality due to HIV/TB is increasing in men, and to some extent women,
aged over 50. Policy makers and practitioners should consider the needs of this growing
and often overlooked group.
Key words: Mortality, ageing, HIV, disability, quality of life, South Africa
Introduction
To date there has been limited effort to investigate the way
the HIV epidemic, the growing burden of non-communic-
able disease, and social conditions and disability affect
older people's mortality in rural African settings.1,2 At the
same time, there is limited knowledge of the health experi-
ence, quality of life and the factors associated with mortal-
ity in older people living in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The
data reported in this paper were collected as part of the
Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE), which
set out to improve knowledge on the health, disability and
well-being of older populations in low- and middle-income
countries.3 Adult mortality has been increasing in southern
and eastern countries of sub-Saharan Africa since the
1990s, mainly as a result of the HIV epidemic.4,5 Most
studies have focused on young adults, ignoring the
fact that the older population is also directly and indirectly
affected by the HIV epidemic.6­8 Existing data show
that one effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is to increase
the number of older people living alone.7 However,
there has been limited attention in the literature to the
prevalence of HIV in older people, despite calls to examine
infection and mortality in the population aged 50 years
and older.1,9 Negin et al. have called attention to the
interplay between the ageing process and the double bur-
den of HIV and non-communicable diseases, especially in
Africa.10
This paper describes factors associated with mortality
in people aged 50 years and over in a rural area of South
Africa where HIV prevalence is high11 and where gender
differences in experience of quality of life, function and
health have been described.12 The objectives of this paper
are twofold: first, to describe the mortality trends and iden-
tify possible HIV-related trends; and second, we aimed to
identify the social and functional risks related to increased
mortality risk in this cohort. In exploring the social and
functional risks, we considered both the well-known and
frequently described `distal causes of disease'13 including
education, occupation13 and poverty,14 as well as other
factors which have been previously associated with higher
mortality risk in this or similar populations. Union (part-
nership) status has been related with poor self-reported
health, quality of life and well-being in older people in dif-
ferent African settings.3,15,16 A single question on self-rated
health and the composite measure on functionality (WHO-
DAS) have been associated with higher risk of mortality in
India17 whereas, in Agincourt HDSS, former Mozambican
refugees have been found to suffer higher levels of child
mortality.18 To further explore the patterns of mortality,
we have included information from the site-specific annual
census from 1993 to 2010.
Methods
Ethical clearance for the MRC/WITS Rural Public Health
and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt) and its
associated Health and Demographic Surveillance System,
and for the Agincourt-INDEPTH Study on Global Ageing
and Adult Health, was granted by the Committee for
Research on Human Subjects (Medical) University of
Key Messages
· Lower quality of life (measured by WHOQOL), lower functionality (measured by WHODAS), lower household assets
score and being single are associated with higher mortality levels in this older South African population.
· As in high-income countries, mortality in a poor rural setting presents with the `male-female survival paradox' where
women experience a higher number of risk factors than men but survive longer.
· Mortality due to HIV/TB, especially in men, has increased in recent years, so that mortality is higher in the younger
old (up to 69 years of age), after which there is an apparent fall in mortality with increasing age.
· In South Africa, policy makers and practitioners should consider the needs of the expanding, but often overlooked,
older population.

The study population and general methods have been
described in detail previously.12 Here, we describe them
briefly.
Setting
In 1992, the MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health
Transitions Research Unit initiated the Agincourt Health
and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the rural
Agincourt sub-district of Ehlanzeni district, Mpumalanga
Province, South Africa. The total population under surveil-
lance in 2006 was approximately 70 000 people distrib-
uted in 21 villages and 11 734 households. Despite
substantial socioeconomic development in the area since
then, infrastructure remains poor and formal unemploy-
ment rate is high (36%) with continuing high levels of la-
bour migration among men and, increasingly, women.19
The public health system in the sub-district consists of six
clinics and one health centre, and three district hospitals
situated between 25 and 45 km from the study site.20 In
2008 a private health centre was built in one village, in-
tended mainly for the treatment and care of people with
HIV. HIV prevalence among all ages from 15 years in the
area was 19.4% in 2010, with a peak of 45.3% for males
and 46.1% for females at ages 35 to 39. The population
over 50 years of age had an HIV prevalence of 16.5%
(17.7% for males and 16.1% for females).11
Basic demographic data (pregnancy outcome, deaths, mi-
gration) are collected every year by trained local field-
workers, to update HDSS census information.21 Additional
individual and household data (food security, labour partici-
pation, household assets) are collected at regular intervals to
provide contextual information. Although the surveillance
system includes information on all deaths, there is incom-
plete official death notification and very few people can re-
port their relatives' cause of death. To determine cause of
death, we use two independent clinician assessments of ver-
bal autopsy interviews. Verbal autopsies are carried out by
trained lay fieldworkers with closest caregivers of the
deceased for every death in the area, allowing us to study
mortality by likely cause of death.22
Sample
In August 2006, there were 8429 people aged 50 years or
over enumerated in the Agincourt HDSS. Of those, we
excluded 575 who had been randomly selected to partici-
pate in a previous recent study; and those who were tem-
porary (often labour) migrants (n ¼ 2223), living for less
than 6 months of the year prior to the study in the sub-
district. The remaining 5631 individuals, who had been
permanently resident in the area for 12 months prior to the
2006 census round, were invited to participate. Each per-
son was visited a maximum of three times to attempt to
complete the interview. Due to the census field constraints,
we were not able to follow up any further those individuals
who were absent from their households on these three vis-
its. As a result, 1616 people (28.7%) were not interviewed
although they were apparently permanently living in the
study site. A further 458 (8.1%) individuals had died or
were too sick to answer the questions, and 47 (0.8%)
declined to take part. A total of 4085 individuals (response
rate of 72.5%) participated.12
Data collection
We used a data collection tool that was adapted from the
World Health Organization (WHO) ­INDEPTH Network
Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)23 to
interview participants during 2006 census. The SAGE
questionnaire included questions on self-rated health as-
sessment, physical and cognitive function, well-being and
quality of life. It was translated into the local language
(Shangaan) and back-translated into English.
Additional data on gender, age, whether married or liv-
ing with a partner, nationality, level of education and date
and cause of death were extracted from the Agincourt
HDSS (2006 census round). Employment status was indi-
cated by being in paid work or not.
We also used HDSS census data, annually updated from
1993 to 2010, on population size and mortality to obtain
the person-years of observation, and to determine out-
migration and death dates.
Follow-up
A total of 2006 study participants were followed up at an-
nual census updates from 2007 to 2009, providing informa-
tion on deaths up to 31 July 2009. Of the 4085 respondents,
38 (0.9%) were lost to follow-up with no information and
have been excluded from analyses. The 4047 remaining par-
ticipants were followed up until out-migration, death or 31
July 2009, whichever came first. Out-migration was defined
as an individual moving away from his/her original dwell-
ing. All efforts were made to follow up those who moved
within the sub-district, but those we could not find in a new
dwelling (48, 1.2%) and those who left the study area (56,
1.4%) were censored at out-migration date. Main reasons
for out-migration were moving to new houses, change of
union status, or work-related issues.
Variables
We calculated age at interview from recorded date of birth
and reported age. We assigned participants to 5-year age
groups.
International Journal of Epidemiology, 2014, Vol. 43, No. 5 1533
Education was categorized according to the WHO lev-
els of education: 6 years or more of formal education; less
than 6 years of formal education; and no formal education.
This information was obtained from the 2006 Agincourt
HDSS database.
Since many unions are traditional rather than civic, and
polygamy is practised by some people, we decided to cat-
egorize union status into two groups: currently married or
living as married (in a current partnership); and single,
including anyone not in a current partnership (i.e. those
who had never married or were separated, divorced or
widowed).
To evaluate socioeconomic status (SES), we used an `ab-
solute SES' indicator constructed from the 2005 household
asset survey. Each asset was given equal weight by rescal-
ing so that all values of a given asset variable fell within
the range [0, 1]. Assets were categorized into five broad
groups: `modern assets', `power supply', `water and sanita-
tion', `quality of housing' and `livestock assets'. For each
household and for each asset group, the asset values were
added and then rescaled to arrive at a specific value in the
range [0,1]. Finally, for each household these five group-
specific scaled values were added to give an overall asset
score with a value in the range [0, 5].24
Household asset scores were calculated using 2005 cen-
sus data, since these were the most recent data available,
and then grouped in quintiles for the entire Agincourt sub-
district population. As participants in this study are a sub-
sample of the whole population (50 years and older), they
are not equally distributed across the five quintiles.
Due to the war in Mozambique, the Agincourt area
received a high number of Mozambican refugees before
1993. Those who elected to remain in the area were re-
corded as Mozambican. The variable `nationality of origin'
refers to whether the participant was originally from South
Africa or Mozambique. The Mozambican group are separ-
ately identified in the HDSS data and differ from the
original South African population in measures such as edu-
cation, household assets and child mortality.18 Many
Mozambicans have now taken South African nationality
which allows them to work legally and receive state
pensions.
The physical and social functions of each participant
were measured using the WHODAS II scale (World Health
Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II) which
assesses daily functioning.25 This scale is created by asking
12 questions on the difficulty experienced when perform-
ing certain activities in past 30 days. The score ranges from
0 to 100, with a high score indicating severe impairment of
physical function. WHOQOL (Word Health Organization
Quality of Life) was used to measure life satisfaction.
WHOQOL includes questions on satisfaction with own
health, personal and social relations, performing daily
activities and overall satisfaction with life. It is presented
on a scale of 8 to 40 (where 8 is the best quality of
life).26,27 We used two single questions to measure self-
rated health and working difficulty, where we asked the
participants `In general, how would you rate your health
today?' with the options of very good, good, moderate,
bad and very bad; and `Overall in the last 30 days, how
much difficulty did you have with work or household
activities?' with options being none, mild, moderate, severe
and extreme/cannot do.
Data entry and analysis
We entered data using CSPro 3.1 data entry programme
(http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/cspro/index.html) which
includes validation checks. Data were then extracted to
Stata10.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) for
analysis.
Demographic analysis
A demographic analysis on the full Agincourt HDSS popu-
lation from 1993 to 2010 was carried out to verify whether
the sample mortality trend by age group was due to a sam-
ple bias or whether it is explained as a new mortality trend
in the study site--that is, up to cohort recruitment. Hazard
mortality ratios were computed using number of deaths
that occurred within the HDSS as the numerator, and
length of time lived in the HDSS over the period as the de-
nominator, expressed in person-years. Individuals were
considered residents when they spent more than 6 months
per year in the HDSS area. In order to minimize effects on
mortality of temporary migrants that return home to die,28
the mortality analysis did not included temporary migrants
who died outside the HDSS or within 6 months of their re-
turn to the study site. The analysis of all-cause mortality
was conducted by gender, 5-year age-group defined by age
in August 2006 and 5-year time period. HIV/TB mortality
was similarly analysed. This demographic analysis pro-
vided background mortality trends to compare with results
from the participants in this study.
Cox regression model
We carried out a Cox's regression analysis to determine
the factors related to the risk of death. We first carried out
an age-adjusted analysis of the impact of the three compos-
ite measures to evaluate whether gender effects could be
merely explained by age differences (Table 2). Then we
performed a univariate analysis (Table 3) and then con-
structed a multivariate model, including age group (treated
as a categorical variable), sex, whether in a union, educa-
tion status and household asset score as a-priori variables.
1534 International Journal of Epidemiology, 2014, Vol. 43, No. 5
We then entered in turn each of the other variables listed in
Table 3, where the univariate analysis returned a P-value
of less than 0.1. In each case, we compared models with
and without the variable, and discarded the variable if the
likelihood ratio test returned a value of P > 0.1. Three
models, for the whole population, for men and for women,
were constructed. Proportional analysis was performed
using proportion hazard assumption. We performed a test
of proportionality for each predictor using the Schoenfeld
and scaled Schoenfeld residuals. If the tests were not sig-
nificant (P-values > 0.05), proportionality was not rejected
and we assumed that there was no violation of the propor-
tional assumption. Once we had constructed the model for
the whole population, we further investigated the effect of
three groups of causes of death (chronic disease; HIV and
TB; and other infections) by running the model separately
for each of these cause groups.
Results
There were 10 967 person-years of follow-up, with 377
deaths recorded. Participants were predominantly female
(75.2%), which represents the demographics of this older
population in the sub-district, with a mean age of 66.1
years at the time of interview. Less than half of the popula-
tion had received any formal education. Men were more
than twice as likely to be currently in a union. Most of the
participants were retired and not looking for work, but
5.7% reported that they were unemployed and looking for
employment.12 Most (56%) of the respondents in paid
work were aged less than 60. A higher proportion of par-
ticipants than expected, especially men, were living in
households with no persons under 50 years of age (9.6%),
or in a skip generation household (2.4%) where there were
children (under 18 years) present but no adults aged under
50 years (Table 1).
We calculated death rates in 5-year age cohorts and found
that in the period 2006­10, the male death rate increased
steadily from age group 50­54 to age group 60­64 but then
fell, only finally surpassing the 60­64 rates in the group
over 85 years of age (see Supplementary Table 1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). A similar but less marked
pattern was observed in women. When we compared the
study men and women death rates with the Agincourt census
death rates for the periods 2003­06 and 2007­10, we only
found a significant difference between the study [death rate
31.4/1000 (95% CI 17.4­56.8)] and the period 2003­06
[death rate 69.3/1000 (95% CI 57.6­83.3)] for men's age
group 50­54 years (see Supplementary Table 1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
The relationship between age group and mortality led
us to analyse mortality data over the entire period of the
annual Agincourt census, from 1993. In Figure 1 we show
the death rates per 1000 person-years for men and women
by age group in four time periods from 1993 to 2010.
Death rates in the younger men increased in each of the
first three time periods up to 74/1000 in the 2003­06
period. This time period shows a drop in mortality for men
aged 65­69 after an essentially flat line in the four younger
age groups. In the final time period the death rates are
lower, but with a similar pattern. Women showed a similar
but less marked pattern.
In Figure 2 we show similar graphs for the cause-
specific death rates from HIV and TB, as determined by
verbal autopsy. These rates rose markedly in the men aged
under 65 years between the 1998­2002 period and the
2003­2006 period, but then fell in the later 2007­10
period. Again, women showed a similar but less marked
pattern in HIV/TB death rate. When mortality contribu-
tion of HIV/TB is calculated as a percentage of all
deaths,we observed that, in the peak period 2003­06 and
in the youngest age group 45­49 years, HIV/TB contrib-
utes with 25% of the deaths in men and 50% of the deaths
in women.
Because of this complex relationship between age, gen-
der and risk of death, age could not be treated as a continu-
ous variable with a linear relationship to survival. We
therefore entered age into the Cox regression analysis as a
categorical variable in 5-year age groups, allowing an inde-
pendent estimation of risk for each age group.
The age-adjusted analysis of the three composite meas-
urements, i.e. quality of life, functionality and health status,
shows that gender effects are not the result of age differences
for mortality or for composite health outcomes (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the results for the univariate analysis of
mortality risk for all demographic and health variables,
and for the fully adjusted model. In the univariate analysis,
women had lower mortality risks and, as previously
described, there was a complex relationship with age. Not
being in a current partnership, living in a household of
lower socioeconomic status and having no formal educa-
tion were all related to increased mortality. In general,
older people living in households with younger adults and/
or in `skip generation' households have lower mortality.
This protective effect remained when the analysis was car-
ried out separately by gender, but only the effect of living
with younger adults had confidence intervals below 1.
People who reported that they were suffering moderate or
bad health and those who reported severe difficulty with
work or household duties experienced higher mortality, as
did those who reported poor function, low quality of life
and lowest health status.
As described in the methods section above, we con-
structed three multivariate Cox regression models: for the

(Table 3). We retained in the model all variables where the
likelihood ratio test returned a value of P > 0.1. The sur-
vival advantage of women was maintained [HR 0.35) 95%

was no clear double peak of mortality with age, the mor-
tality risk was similar for all ages between 50 and 79, sug-
gesting that the younger age groups were experiencing
higher mortality than would be expected. Poor physical
function was associated with a greater risk of dying; those
women reporting the worst function had nearly double the
risk of dying compared with those in the highest function
group [HR 1.92 (95% CI 1.16­3.16)]. In addition, lower
socioeconomic status and not being in a current partner-
ship were associated with a higher risk of dying independ-
ently of disability.
The fully adjusted model for men shows a clear double
peak in age-related mortality, with an increased mortality
risk up to age 69: 60­64, HR 2.10 (95% CI 1.00­4.39)
and 65­69, HR 2.03 (95% CI 1.01­4.09). Only from age
85 onwards, the risk of dying was again higher than that in
men in their 60 s.
We grouped cause of death into broad categories be-
cause there were relatively few deaths. These categories
were chronic disease (164 deaths), HIV/TB (78 deaths),
other infections (67 deaths), other causes (20 deaths) and
unknown (48 deaths). In Table 4 we show the same general
population model for each of the first three of these catego-
ries separately. The model is shown in more detail in
Supplementary Table 4 (available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Whereas the models for chronic diseases
and other infections show the expected age gradient with
increasing risk at older ages, the model for HIV/TB shows
an inverted relationship with age such that older people
are at lower risk.
Discussion
We have presented the results of 3 years of follow-up on
over 4000 older people living in rural South Africa. We set
out to describe some of the factors associated with mortal-
ity in a cohort of older people living in an area of rural
South Africa with high HIV prevalence. One of the
strengths of this study is that it is based in a sub-district
that is covered by a health and demographic surveillance
system, where the population has been followed for 18
years and there is access to high-quality mortality and

cause of death data. Moreover, we achieved high follow-
up of the participants in the study, with only 1.2% lost to
follow-up at 3 years. All those recruited at baseline had
been permanently resident in the research site for at least
12 months before recruitment, thus reducing the likelihood
of including labour migrants who had `returned home to
die'. There is inevitably some bias in recruitment at base-
line, in that those who were unable to respond, usually be-
cause they had died or were too sick (8.1%), were not
included as were those who were not present to be inter-
viewed (28.7%). Excluding people who were ill will result
in under-representation of those in poor health, whereas
the exclusion of the much larger number of individuals
who were not available could influence the results either
positively or negatively.
For rural sub-Saharan Africa, there was a high propor-
tion of participants living in households without younger
adults, including those older persons living in `skip gener-
ation' households. This might be related to the impact of
the HIV epidemic on younger adults as well as the increas-
ing number of young men and women joining the migrant
work force.29 The situation is likely to impact on the well-
being and health of the older population, although only the
univariate analysis shows higher mortality in those people
living in households without younger adults or children,
possibly due to the weight of other socio-demographic fac-
tors such as education and socioeconomic status.
Moreover, we observed the lowest mortality in the small
group of individuals (2.4%) living in `skip generation'
households, although this might be accounted for by selec-
tion bias, in that only fitter older people become sole care-
givers for children.
People of Mozambican origin have a higher risk of mor-
tality in the univariate analysis, an effect that it is not
observed in the multivariate analysis. This may be because
people of South African origin suffer higher levels of HIV.11
Our results demonstrate higher survival in women.
Individuals who were not in a partnership had lower sur-
vival, as did those with lower socioeconomic status, higher
levels of disability and lower quality of life. We have previ-
ously demonstrated that women in this cohort report
higher disability and lower quality of life even after adjust-
ing for the effect of age.12 These findings reflect the `male-
female health survival paradox'30,31 frequently observed in
high-income countries, where women report poorer health
and quality of life and yet have lower death rates. It may
be related to some other set of health protective mechan-
isms, whether biologically-based or involving health-
promoting behaviours or forms of social protection in
families, but we are unable to investigate this further with
these data.
A striking finding is the pattern of mortality, particu-
larly in men, with an apparent fall in mortality with
increasing age after an earlier rise. We do not believe that
this is due to errors in recorded date of birth. Although all
participants in this study were born before 1992 when the
first census round was undertaken, and birthdates were
not certified by the HDSS field team, those dates were later
compared and corrected with those in the National ID
cards that most of the population hold. Moreover, ages
were further analysed looking for trends that could
indicate age misreporting (for example, low numbers in a
specific age group compared with others), but no evident
trend in misreporting was found.
We have shown, using HDSS data from 1993 to 2010,
that mortality rose dramatically in this older population
(Figure 1). The effect is more pronounced for men than for
women and is probably accounted for by an increasing
number of deaths from HIV and TB (Figure 2). This is
confirmed by comparison of the different causes of death
models (Table 4). There is highest mortality in the age
group 50­54 years for the model including HIV/TB deaths,
but the more usual higher mortality at older ages for mod-
els including chronic diseases and other infections.
Our observations suggest that older people in the
Agincourt sub-district are experiencing overall worsening
of mortality. These changes are probably due to a combin-
ation of the direct effect of the HIV epidemic on older
adults, and the effects of the HIV epidemic on the survival
of younger adults. Whereas mortality remains higher than

in the earliest time period, the most recent period--from
2007 to 2010 (Figures 1 and 2)--has seen reduction from
the highest levels of mortality in both men and women.
This may be related to the introduction of antiretroviral
therapy in the area from 2007.
This population is continuing to age and moreover, as
highly active antiretroviral therapy becomes more available,
growing numbers of people living with HIV will survive to
enter the older age groups. Efforts to enhance the well-being
of older persons will become increasingly important. These
findings have important implications for rural South African
communities and for the development of health and social
systems.Policy makers and practitioners should consider the
needs of this growing and often overlooked group.
