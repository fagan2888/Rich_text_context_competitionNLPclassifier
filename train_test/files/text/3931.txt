to influence the learner. In "affective observation," on the other
hand, the learner simply observes the knower interacting with a
person or object, and makes evaluative inferences about the lat-
ter on the basis of the knower's expressive behavior. Both social
referencing and affective observation are instances of what
Clément and Dukes call "social appraisal."
The question is whether this distinction between social refer-
encing and affective observation is one that is scientifically use-
ful. In answering this question, it is worth considering the two
central panels of Figure 2 in the Clément and Dukes article
(2017), because these capture what these authors regard as the
key process differences between the two constructs. In one case,
social referencing, the learner interacts with a stimulus that
gives rise to uncertainty, or even anxiety. The knower monitors
this interaction and deliberately modulates it by engaging in
ostensive communication. In the case of affective observation,
the knower interacts with a stimulus that generates emotionally
expressive behavior in the knower without any explicit inten-
tion to communicate this to the learner; the learner observes this
interaction and draws an inference about the emotional qualities
of the stimulus.
This distinction is, we think, conceptually clear and is likely
to be important in understanding the role played by emotional
expressions in social learning. Take a child who interacts for the
first time with another child who belongs to a different ethnic
group. The first child may be uncertain and look to his or her
caregiver. The latter's smiles encourage the child to interact
with the outgroup child. The adult thereby actively teaches the
child a "lesson" about the emotional value of outgroup mem-
bers. Contrast this with a situation in which a child witnesses his
or her caregiver interacting warily with an adult who is a mem-
ber of a different ethnic group, and making a negative expres-
sion behind the other adult's back when the interaction is over.
Here the adult unwittingly teaches the child a lesson about the
emotional value of outgroup members. These two sets of cir-
cumstances differ in significant respects (not least in terms of
the implications for interventions).
However, if we were to focus on the value of this distinction
for understanding how emotional experience and behavior are
influenced by others, we might arrive at a different conclusion.
To understand the way in which social influences operate on the
emotion process, it makes little difference whether the learner's
emotional response to a stimulus is shaped by being actively
steered by expressive behavior that is deliberately communi-
cated by a knower, or by witnessing the knower interacting with
the stimulus and apparently enjoying (or disliking) the experi-
ence. Either way, the learner's emotional response to the stimu-
lus is shaped by inferences made about the knower's appraisals.
A final point is that we believe that there is another poten-
tially important difference between social referencing and social
appraisal that is not explicitly mentioned in either article,
namely the circumstances under which these phenomena take
place. Social referencing is likely to be used in situations that
are novel and the individual is seen to need others' appraisals to
help him or her to disambiguate the situation. In the classic
social referencing context, the knower's appraisal becomes the
child's appraisal. In principle, social appraisal applies to a
broader set of circumstances, having the potential to shape both
initial appraisals of a stimulus and subsequent reappraisals.
Thus passengers who are initially calm during a turbulent flight
may become anxious when they hear the screams of a flight
attendant, and students who are mildly disappointed with how
their essays have been graded may become angry when exposed
to fellow students' appraisals of unfairness. It is not that others'
appraisals of the event are adopted because the passengers or
students are uncertain about how to appraise it; rather, others'
appraisals serve to modulate an initial appraisal. Thus social ref-
erencing is likely to occur early in the emotion process, whereas
social appraisal could occur at virtually any stage. This is a sub-
tle but potentially important difference when it comes to identi-
fying the processes that are triggered when we are exposed to
others' emotions.

Abstract
To what extent does the level of overlap between social appraisal and social
referencing depend upon the particular definitions adopted when following
different research agendas? I argue that processes of both kinds fall under
the more inclusive heading of relation alignment. Relation alignment also
covers emotional influence that is not mediated by the communication of
appraisal. Similarities, interdependences, and distinctions between these
various relation-alignment processes warrant further investigation.

referencing
Are social appraisal and social referencing the same thing? Is
there underlying commonality in the kinds of emotional influ-
ence implied by both concepts? Or is social referencing just
one example of a number of possible social appraisal pro-
cesses? Answers to these questions obviously depend on our
definitions of "social appraisal" and "social referencing"
because adopting a more restrictive or inclusive formulation
of either construct can tip the balance of argument in one or
the other direction. For example, a relatively broad concept of
social appraisal is more likely to encompass a relatively nar-
row concept of social referencing than vice versa. But is there
something deeper at stake; something that goes beyond seman-
tics and gets to the bottom of how emotions regulate other
people's behaviour across social development and during real-
time interactions between adults?
Three decades back, similar considerations surrounded the
affective primacy controversy (Lazarus, 1984; Zajonc, 1984).
Whether emotion always depends on cognition is another ques-
tion whose answer hinges on how inclusively the key concepts
are formulated (e.g., Leventhal & Scherer, 1987; Parkinson &
Manstead, 1992). Emotion without cognition is clearly possible
if "emotion" is defined broadly enough and "cognition" is
defined narrowly enough. However, definitional respecification
of this kind leaves more fundamental questions about what
kinds of "emotion" depend on what kinds of "cognition" unan-
swered (Leventhal & Scherer, 1987). In the affective primacy
controversy, moving beyond definitional disputes involved
addressing these more specific questions. Arguably, the
burgeoning study of interpersonal emotional influence processes
should follow a similar trajectory.
Different researchers have certainly used the terms "social
appraisal" and "social referencing" in a variety of overlapping
senses. Although both concepts consistently refer to interac-
tions in which one person's emotion influences another per-
son's evaluative orientation to an object or event, these
interactions can involve a range of processes, and these pro-
cesses can serve a range of functions. The extent to which the
processes and functions need to be distinguished depends on
the agenda guiding the research in question. When the theoreti-
cal goal is to characterize the spectrum of interpersonal pro-
cesses whereby people acquire information about the affective
significance of events, it makes sense to make corresponding
distinctions (e.g., Clément & Dukes, 2017). When the theoreti-
cal goal is to uncover unifying principles underlying the devel-
opment of interpersonal emotional influence, continuities
rather than discontinuities start to seem more important (Walle,
Reschke, & Knothe, 2017).
My research (e.g., Parkinson, Simons, & Niven, 2016)
mainly focuses on real-time interactions in which adult "know-
ers" and "learners" repeatedly switch roles and where influence
operates dynamically and bidirectionally. In these contexts,
each person's attention can shift rapidly from a referential object
to the other person, or to the relation between self and other, or
between self or other and object. For example, a wife expresses
worry about her ability to cope with a current concern, and her
husband may orient at different moments to the concern, his
wife, her orientation to him, and to the concern (e.g., Parkinson
& Simons, 2012). Each partner may strategically regulate some
aspects of their emotional orientation, while other (often simul-
taneous) processes of mutual adjustment operate at less explicit
levels (e.g., Parkinson & Simons, 2009).
I use the flexible term "relation alignment" (e.g., Parkinson,
2008) to capture the variety of emotional influence processes
operating during these interactions. Relation alignment
includes social appraisal along with other forms of interper-
sonal adjustment that do not depend on explicit communica-
tion or transfer of appraisal information. For me, social
referencing is an even more specific concept covering a par-
ticular form of interaction in which one person actively seeks
out clarificatory evaluative information from another person.
This evaluative information then affects the second person's
behaviour by a process of social appraisal. In other words,
both social appraisal and social referencing imply interper-
sonal information transfer and communication of emotional
meaning, whereas relation alignment can operate prior to, and
as part of, the production of emotional meaning.
More basic forms of relation alignment also seem to precede
the acquisition of social appraisal and social referencing in
developing children. Infants adjust to (e.g., Stern, Hofer, Haft,
& Dore, 1985) and actively operate on (e.g., Reddy, 2008) car-
egivers' emotions before they begin to represent the relational
meaning of those emotions in terms of appraisal (Parkinson,
2007). Indeed, some of the earliest forms of infant­caregiver
interaction involve regulation of direct relations between inter-
actants rather than their respective orientations towards any ref-
erential object. Social referencing probably depends on
subsequent co-ordination of this more directly interpersonal
relation alignment with the development of shared attention
towards objects.
Despite its potential reducibility to a definitional dispute, the
old affective primacy debate at least served to draw attention to

emotion-related phenomena that did not depend on prior
generation of explicit meaning. Similarly, I want to argue that
whatever forms of "cognition," "appraisal," or "social referenc-
ing" characterize the earliest and most basic instances of rela-
tion alignment, they do not necessarily involve ostension or the
active extraction of appraisal information. Mutual orientations
can adjust to one another, and their interpersonal consolidation
at some point produces emergent emotional meanings (e.g.,
Fogel, 1993), which need not be registered as such by either
party to the exchange.

Comment: Reframing the Conceptual Diversity of Social Appraisal and
Social Referencing
Manfred Holodynski
Department of Psychology, University of Münster, Germany
Abstract
The comment discusses the common ground and differences of the
contribution of Walle, Reschke, and Knothe (2017), as well as that of
Clément and Dukes (2017) in their efforts to conceptually connect
an important concept from infancy research, namely that of social
referencing, with an important one from emotion research on adults,
that of social appraisal. The distinction between social referencing and
affective observation under the generic concept of social appraisal could
be worthwhile for differentiating implicit and explicit impacts of a model's
behavior on a child's emotional development.

The contribution of Walle et al. (2017), as well as that of
Clément and Dukes (2017) are aimed at conceptually connect-
ing an important concept from infancy research, namely that of
social referencing (SR), with an important one from emotion
research on adults, that of social appraisal (SA). It is worthwhile
and indeed necessary to link these currently unrelated research
domains, as this makes the results mutually more compelling. In
a world of already highly specialized research in psychology,
such an integrative task is tackled all too seldom, resulting in a
diversity of concepts for very similar phenomena that then stand
side by side, without any conceptual links. The concepts of SR
and SA are prime cases in point. A second advantage of such an
integration of concepts from childhood and adulthood research
is that it serves to check and confirm the integrative potential
