Introduction
Benign stricture of the esophagus (BSE) can
severely reduce quality of life and cause major
complications such as aspiration, weight loss, and
malnutrition [Ferguson, 2005].
Endoscopic or fluoroscopic dilatation of the
esophagus with balloons or graduated dilators has
become the treatment of choice for BSE. However,
this treatment remains controversial since long-
term recurrence rates progressively increase with
time, contingent upon stricture etiology, from
20% to 61% [Choi et al. 2007; Cheng et al. 2003].
Permanent placement of metallic stents is not rec-
ommended for BSE as the procedure is associated
with additional problems such as re-stricture from
tissue hyperplasia, stent migration, and fistula for-
mation [Schembre et al. 2011; Bick et al. 2013;
Stewart et al. 2013]. Although the use of a fully
covered membrane makes a metallic stent remov-
able and theoretically can reduce long-term com-
plications, this design runs the risk of in-stent
tissue growth during insertion or dysphagia recur-
rence after removal [Hirdes et al. 2012; Vlavianos
and Zabron, 2012]. Self-expandable plastic stents
minimize tissue reaction and can be removed

Abstract
Background: We determined the feasibility of, and tissue response to silicone-covered
biodegradable magnesium- and plastic-stent insertion into the esophagus in rabbits.
Methods: The mechanical compression­recovery characteristics and degradation behaviors
of the magnesium stent were investigated in vitro. A total of 45 rabbits were randomly divided
into a magnesium- (n = 15) and a plastic- (n = 15) stent group, and underwent stent insertion
into the lower third of the esophagus under fluoroscopic guidance; a control group (n = 15)
did not undergo the intervention. Esophagography was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Five
rabbits in each group were euthanized at each time point for histological examination.
Results: Silicone-covered magnesium stents showed similar radial force to plastic stents
(p > 0.05). The magnesium stents degraded rapidly in an acidic solution, but 90.2% ± 3.1% of
the residual mass was maintained after a 2-week degradation in a solution with a pH of 4.0.
All stent insertions were well tolerated. Magnesium stents migrated in six rabbits (one at 1
week, one at 2 weeks and four at 4 weeks), and plastic stents migrated in three rabbits (one
at 2 weeks and two at 4 weeks; p > 0.05). Esophageal wall remodeling (thinner epithelial and
smooth muscle layers) was similar in both stented groups (p > 0.05), and the esophagus wall
was found to be significantly thinner in the stented groups than in the control group (p < 0.05).
Esophageal injury and collagen deposition following stent insertion were similar and did not
differ from the control group (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: Esophageal silicone-covered magnesium stents provided reliable support for
at least 2 weeks, with acceptable migration rates and without causing severe injury or tissue
reaction compared with plastic stents.

easily, and were thus recommended for BSE
treatment.
However, due to their nonbiodegradable charac-
ter, the stent-retrieval procedure exposes patients
to the risk of bleeding and pain [Ham and
Kim, 2014; Yim, 2014]. Biodegradable, silicone-
covered magnesium esophageal stents are very
appealing as they would provide similar radial
support as other metallic stents, without causing
complications associated with nonbiodegradable
stent insertion.
We inserted biodegradable, silicone-covered
magnesium stents into the normal esophagus of
rabbits to determine the feasibility of this tech-
nique and observe the in vivo tissue reaction after
stent insertion in comparison with that after plas-
tic stent insertion. In addition, the mechanical
support provided and the biodegradation process
were tested in vitro.
Materials and methods
Silicone-covered magnesium and plastic stents
The silicone-covered magnesium and plastic
stents used consisted of two parts: a bare stent
and a silicone membrane. The bare magnesium
stent was knitted from a 0.20 mm-wide magne-
sium alloy wire (AZ31, Mg-3Al-1Zn). AZ31 is
a commercial magnesium alloy (Sanming,
Biomedical Company, Yangzhou, China) with
the following chemical composition (in mass per-
centage): 3% Al, 1% Zn, and 0.43% Mn and Mg
(balance). It is supplied in the form of cast ingots.
The plastic stent is knitted from a 0.25 mm
diameter polypropylene wire (density, 76 g/m2)
(Convidien, Trevoux, France). The density of
wire cross distribution, the height, and the knit
angle of the stent were the same as those of the
magnesium stent made using the same cast ingots.
The stent consisted of a cylindrical, cross-linked
mesh body made of the magnesium alloy or poly-
propylene, with a 14 mm cylinder and a dilated
portion at its head and distal end to prevent stent
migration. The diameter of the main body was
10 mm; the total stent length was 31 mm when
fully expanded (Figure 1a and b). A silicone
membrane (C6-530 with A and B components,
Dow Corning Company, China) was used to coat
the stent body via a dipping and spinning method:
(a) precision aluminum molds of the stent were
used to fabricate the wire framework; (b) equal
portions of the two parts of the silicone rubber
were thoroughly blended together using N-octane
as a solvent prior to use; (c) the mixed silicone
was dipped on the stent mold and cured for 6 h at
Figure 1. Photographs of the magnesium (a) and plastic (b) stents. Mechanical analysis revealed that the
magnesium stent had a similar radial force to the plastic stent (p > 0.05) (c).

80°C for drying. The molds were cooled for 3 h in
ambient conditions; the stent prototypes were
stripped from the molds. The stent body was not
radio-opaque, so a mark was placed at its distal
end to facilitate accurate positioning under fluor-
oscopy. We compressed and deployed each stent
using a 6 mm-wide (approximately 18F) delivery
system.
Magnesium-silicone stent evaluation in vitro
The compression­recovery characteristics of the
silicone-covered magnesium stent and plastic
stent were investigated using a mechanical testing
machine (Instron 5567, Norwood, MA, USA).
Magnesium-stent degradation was evaluated by
determining the mass lost from the stent. Stents
were sectioned into 1 × 1 mm2 squares. The pre-
weighed pieces were incubated at 37°C in 20.0 ml
of two phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions
with pH values of 7.4 and 4.0. At each experi-
mental time point, triplicate stent samples were
recovered and rinsed with distilled water; the
stents were dried to a constant weight in vacuum
desiccators. Mass loss was determined gravimet-
rically by comparing the dry weight remaining at
a specific time with the initial weight.
Stent insertion
All protocols were approved by the Animal
Research Committee of our institution and con-
ducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
International Council on Animal Care. A total of
45 healthy rabbits of both sexes (weight, 2.3­3.8
kg) were randomly divided into a magnesium-
stent group (n = 15), a plastic-stent group (n =
15), and a control group (n = 15). Rabbits in
the magnesium- and plastic-stent groups under-
went stent placement in the lower third of the
esophagus. A 0.035-inch, 260 cm-long, stiff
exchange wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was
inserted through the mouth and into the stom-
ach under fluoroscopic guidance. The stent-
delivery system was introduced over the
guidewire until it reached the lower third of the
esophagus. The stent was then released, accord-
ing to esophagography images obtained under
fluoroscopic guidance. A balloon catheter (10 ×
40 mm) was inflated within the stent to achieve
full stent expansion. Repeat esophagography
was performed to confirm the degree of stent
expansion and exclude esophageal perforation.
Animals in the control group did not undergo
stent insertion.
Follow up
Esophagography was performed under general
anesthesia and in the upright position prior to
stent placement, and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks follow-
ing stent insertion. Stent migration, stent patency,
and diameter of the stented esophagus were com-
pared between the two groups.
Histological examination
Five animals in each group were euthanized
at each time point to compare tissue reactions.
The inserted stent was carefully removed from
the resected esophageal sample. The silicone-
covered magnesium stent was knitted using a
magnesium line and comprised 420 mesh cells.
Considering that the support provided by the
stent was mainly attributable to the mesh cells,
the stent-degradation rate was determined by
calculating the percentage of degraded mesh
cells. A mesh cell was considered to be degraded
if one of its four sides appeared discontinuous
under microscopic observation. Minor, moder-
ate, and severe degradation of the magnesium-
silicone stent were defined as < 25%, 25­50%,
and > 50% broken mesh cells in the total
number of mesh cells.
The stented and control esophageal samples were
fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for a mini-
mum of 48 h, passed through a series of graded
ethanol solutions (70­100%), and embedded in
paraffin. Serial paraffin-embedded, esophageal
cross-sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (HE) to evaluate the inflammatory reaction
based on revised inflammation scores [Kornowski
et al. 1998]. The scoring was performed as fol-
lows: 0 = no submucosal inflammatory cell infil-
tration; 1 = inflammatory cells infiltrating less
than one third of the submucosa; 2 = inflamma-
tory cells infiltrating more than one third but not
the entire submucosa; and 3 = inflammatory cells
infiltrating the entire submucosa. Masson tri-
chrome staining was used to assess submucosal
collagen deposition. Esophageal samples were
immunostained with mouse anti-proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (1:100 dilu-
tion) (NeoMarkers, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) and mouse monoclonal
-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) antibody (1:50
dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., CA,
USA) via the Elivision immunohistochemical
technique. Negative controls were prepared by
omitting the primary antibodies. The pathologist
who reviewed the specimens and performed the

analysis was blinded to the animal randomization,
treatment procedures, and follow-up protocols.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for
statistical analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to
compare nonparametric data. Continuous varia-
bles were expressed as mean ± standard devia-
tion, and categorical variables as numbers or
percentages. One-way and two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the
overall changes in esophageal diameter following
stent insertion and at each follow-up time point,
and to compare the PCNA proliferation index
and collagen area at each follow-up time point
within or between the control and stented groups.
Before one-way ANOVA, the homogeneity of
variance and normal distribution of the depend-
ent variables were assessed using the Shapiro­
Wilk test. Statistical significance was defined as
p < 0.05.
Results
Magnesium-silicone stent and its mechanical
evaluation
The silicone membrane had a uniform thickness of
100 m, it was tightly wrapped and fixed to the
cross-linked, knitted, bare magnesium or plastic
mesh tube and maintained its size and morphology
due to its excellent flexibility and elasticity. The
silicone-covered magnesium stent displayed good
elastic deformation properties owing to its ability
to spring back after compression, with no silicone
membrane tearing or ablations after 46 repeated
compressions (compression distance: 0­8 mm).
The magnesium stent showed a radial force of 0.89
± 0.18, 1.75 ± 0.25, 3.38 ± 0.51, and 4.91 ±
0.42 N when compressed by 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm,
respectively, which was similar to that for the plas-
tic stent (p > 0.05) at the same compression dis-
placement (Figure 1c). Thus, the silicone-coated
magnesium stents possessed good flexibility and
elasticity, and could provide enough support
against lesion compression when used in vivo.
Biodegradation of magnesium-silicone stent in
vitro
The degradation behaviors of the magnesium-
silicone stents in terms of the magnesium mass
lost were determined in buffer solutions with pH
values of 7.4 and 4.0 (Figure 2). The residual
mass of the silicone-coated wires was 96.3% ±
2.4%, 90.2% ± 3.1%, and 73.4% ± 4.7% in
acidic PBS (pH 4.0) compared with 98.4% ±
1.1%, 92.5% ± 2.8%, and 80.7% ± 4.3% in neu-
tral PBS (pH 7.4), at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, respec-
tively (p < 0.01). However, despite a faster speed
of degradation in acidic solution, the silicone-
coated wires maintained 73.4% of their mass
weight at 4 weeks, indicating that silicone-coated
magnesium was a reasonable choice of material
for the fabrication of biodegradable stents in
terms of possible retention time.
Intervention procedure
Stenting was successful in all 30 rabbits using
magnesium and plastic stents. All rabbits toler-
ated the procedure well. Procedure-related
adverse events, including esophageal perforation
and bleeding, did not occur during or following
stent insertion. Esophagography revealed that the
contrast agent passed smoothly through the
stented esophagus in both groups (Figure 3a and
b). No immediate stent migration into the stom-
ach occurred after stent placement.
Follow up
All rabbits in both groups underwent regular
esophagography; no animal died during follow
up. Stent migration occurred in six rabbits in the
magnesium-stent group (1 week, one rabbit; 2
weeks, one rabbit; and 4 weeks, four rabbits), and
the plastic stent migrated in three rabbits (one at
2 weeks and two at 4 weeks; p > 0.05). The

esophageal diameter in the magnesium-stent
group was 10.10 ± 0.75 mm after stent insertion
and 9.73 ± 0.73 mm after 1 week, which were
larger than the corresponding values in the con-
trol group (9.21 ± 1.14 mm and 9.12 ± 0.78
mm, respectively; p < 0.05). Follow-up esoph-
agography revealed no in-stent stenosis. The
mean diameter of the magnesium-stented esoph-
agus (9.59 ± 0.51 mm) at the end of follow up
(4 weeks) was similar to that observed immedi-
ately after stent insertion (10.10 ± 0.75 mm;
p > 0.05), and that in the control group at
4 weeks (9.55 ± 0.41 mm; p > 0.05). The esoph-
ageal diameter did not significantly differ between
the magnesium- and plastic-stent groups immedi-
ately after stent insertion and at each follow-up
time point (p > 0.05) (Figure 3b).
The magnesium-stent morphological changes
in vivo
Microscopic examination of the magnesium-sili-
cone stents revealed that biodegraded mesh cells
accounted for 5.1% ± 2.5% (n = 4; minor degra-
dation) of the total cells at 1 week, 16.3% ± 3.6%
(n = 4; minor degradation) at 2 weeks, and 89.0%
(n = 1; severe degradation) at 4 weeks. The deg-
radation rates significantly differed between 1
week and 2 weeks (p = 0.002) (Figure 3d).
Interestingly, among the six magnesium-silicone
stents that migrated into the stomach, four were
almost completely degraded, with only 1.5% ±
2.3% nondegraded mesh cells (severe degrada-
tion), and the remaining two stents were elimi-
nated from the body.
Histological study
HE staining revealed significant esophageal wall
remodeling in the magnesium- and plastic-stent
groups than in the control group. The inflamma-
tion scores at 1, 2, and 4 weeks (0.2 ± 0.4, 0.4 ±
0.5, and 0.2 ± 0.4, respectively) in the magne-
sium-stent group were similar to those in the
plastic-stent and control group (p > 0.05).
PCNA-positive cells (squamous epithelial cells)

insertion revealed that the stented esophagus is patent. The diameter of the stented esophagus immediately
after stent insertion and after 1, 2, and 4 weeks follow up in the control, magnesium- stent, and plastic-stent
groups (c). Macro- and microscopic examination of the magnesium stent showed an increase in the number of
biodegraded mesh cells with time (d). *p < 0.05 for comparisons of the control and stented groups. CG, control

were mainly found in the epithelial layer; squa-
mous epithelial cells located near the lumen and
close to the stent were mostly negative for
PCNA. Quantitative analysis of the PCNA-
positive cells revealed no significant difference in
proliferation index between the two stented
groups and the control (p > 0.05). The epithelial
layer, as measured on PCNA staining, was much
thinner in the magnesium- (111.4 ± 32.5 m)
and plastic- (111.30 ± 34.08 m) stent groups
than in the control group (239.5 ± 17.2 m;
p < 0.05). Immunostaining revealed that the
SMA layer in the media was significantly thinner
in the magnesium- (27.0 ± 10.3 m) and plastic-
(32.42 ± 12.14 m) stent groups than in the con-
trol (93.6 ± 19.0 m; p < 0.05). However, the
thickness of the epithelial and SMA layers did not
differ between the two stented groups and at dif-
ferent follow-up time points (p > 0.05). Masson
staining revealed that collagen was mainly local-
ized in the submucosa, with no significant differ-
ences between the stented groups and the control
group at each follow-up time point (p > 0.05),
indicating that the tissue reaction to injury caused
by stent dilation and degradation was similar to
that in the control group (Figure 4).
Discussion
We determined the feasibility of, and tissue
response to biodegradable magnesium-stent
insertion into the normal esophagus of rabbits.
Our main findings are as follows. (a) Silicone-
covered magnesium stents provided reliable
radial force comparable with plastic stents.
(b) The procedural success rate of magnesium-
stent insertion was 100%, with the stents provid-
ing good support for at least 2 weeks before
undergoing rapid biodegradation in vivo.
(c) Stenting effectively resulted in esophageal wall
remodeling, which was associated with minimal
injury and inflammatory reaction. BSE, including
refractory peptic, caustic, anastomotic, and pos-
tradiotherapy strictures, may cause difficulty in
feeding and greatly affect quality of life [Ferguson,
2005].
Esophageal stent insertion can effectively recana-
lize the occluded lumen without open surgery and
is widely used to treat malignant esophageal
obstruction [Na et al. 2013]. However, since
long-term or permanent stent insertion is associ-
ated with stent migration, esophageal perforation,
fistula, and even hemorrhage, it cannot be used to
treat BSE. We had previously developed a retriev-
able, temporary stent and a temporary, drug-
eluting stent to treat benign cardia strictures, with
good treatment outcomes. However, the insertion
of these stents was nevertheless associated with
complications during stent retrieval and stent
migration into the stomach. Ideally, stents for
BSE should provide enough force to tear the
stricture and then completely biodegrade to
reduce complications caused by stent placement,
without precluding repeated stent insertion. The
magnesium alloy we employed is rigid and under-
goes in vivo degradation [Gu et al. 2009].
This prevents a postimplantation inflammatory
response and tissue proliferation, and thus, the
Figure 4. Both the epithelial (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells) and smooth muscle cell layers
were significantly thinner in the magnesium- and plastic-stent groups than in the control group (magnification
×400; the yellow and red lines indicate the thickness of the epithelial and smooth muscle actin [SMA] layers,
respectively). *p < 0.05 for comparisons between the control and the stented groups.

alloy is ideal for in vivo stents [Li et al. 2015].
However, this magnesium alloy undergoes rapid
degradation (nearly 50% degradation after 1 week
in vitro). Rapid degradation can lead to rapid loss
of the mechanical properties of the alloy, making it
difficult to maintain long-term structural support
after implantation to effectively treat the disease
[Wong et al. 2010]. Silicone has excellent elastic-
ity, coating properties, and is resistant to in vivo
degradation. In this study, magnesium alloy wires
were used as rigid stent struts, and silicone mem-
branes were used to cover the magnesium struts.
The main advantages of this design included:
(a) stabilization of the magnesium alloy stent
structure; (b) bonding of the wire crossing points;
(c) improvement of repeated radial expansibility
and contractibility; (d) isolation of the magnesium
alloy, preventing it from coming into direct
contact with bodily fluids and increasing biodeg-
radation time; (e) maintenance of stent structure
during degradation of the magnesium alloy;
(f) excretion of the silicone membrane through
the stool after stent degradation.
Mechanical tests showed that under different
compression distances, this stent has excellent
recovery properties. After nearly 50 compres-
sions, the material could still maintain its original
mechanical compressive strength. This illustrates
that the silicone-stabilized magnesium alloy tubu-
lar stent can maintain its mechanical properties
and structural stability.
Stent degradation rate directly affects the struc-
tural support provided by the stent. In vitro exper-
iments revealed that the silicone coating increased
the degradation time of the magnesium alloy. In
neutral PBS, 60% of the original mass remained
after 10 weeks, while in acidic PBS, complete
degradation occurred within 10 weeks. In vivo
examination revealed that only 5.1% and 16.3%
of the inserted magnesium-silicone mesh had bio-
degraded at 1 and 2 weeks of follow up, respec-
tively, indicating that the stent provided good
support up to 2 weeks in the rabbit esophagus.
The magnesium-silicone stent rapidly biode-
graded, lost radial force and collapsed after
2 weeks. All the above data indicate that magne-
sium-silicone stents effectively provided good
support for at least 2 weeks.
Thrombus formation and distal embolism are
major problems with magnesium stents inserted
in the coronary artery [Haude et al. 2013].
However, in our study, the degraded stents,
including the nonbiodegradable silicone, were
safely excreted from the body. Two magnesium-
silicone stents that migrated into the stomach
when their mechanical support was lost were con-
firmed to have been safely excreted from the body
before 4 weeks.
The basic concept underlying the treatment of
BSEs is to tear the fibrous connective tissue or
hyperplastic smooth muscle layer, and provide
enough support until the esophageal wall has
healed. Our previous work has indicated that the
optimal duration of stenting for cardia strictures
is 2­4 weeks [Zhu et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b].
Tanaka and colleagues reported the use of a poly-
lactic stent for the treatment of benign gastroin-
testinal tract stenosis, and this ultraflex-type stent
made from machine-knitted polylactic acid
monofilaments showed better radial force than a
metallic wall stent. However, this stent was diffi-
cult to compress into a delivery system, and its
migration rate was 100% at 12­14 days after
insertion [Tanaka et al. 2006]. Although the
effective support time for the magnesium-silicone
stent was only 2 weeks, we believe that it may still
yield good treatment outcomes in BSE, mainly
because on pathological examination, we found
that the epithelial and SMA layers had already
stretched and become much thinner at 1 and
2 weeks, indicating the remodeling process had
been completed. Moreover, our previous studies
were mainly focused on cardia strictures, which
often require greater dilation for longer durations
than esophageal strictures [Ferguson, 2005; Na
et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b].
The other pathological findings, including inflam-
mation scores on HE staining and esophageal
wall injury assessed using PCNA staining of the
epithelial layer and submucosal collagen deposi-
tion, revealed that magnesium-stent insertion or
biodegradation itself did not cause severe damage
to the esophageal wall, induce significant inflam-
matory reaction, or result in scar formation. In
this study, we consider that the rabbit was suita-
ble as a model of the human esophagus as it has
similar esophageal wall structure and gastric pH
conditions to humans. The muscle layer transi-
tions from striated muscle in the upper esophagus
to smooth muscle in the lower esophagus. The
gastric pH during the digestion of food material is
maintained between 1 and 2. Both these proper-
ties are similar to those observed in humans
[Davies et al. 2003]. However, the entire
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(1)
18 http://tag.sagepub.com
esophagus and the first half of the stomach are
covered by squamous epithelium, which is differ-
ent to the case in humans.
This study has some limitations. (a) The magne-
sium-silicone stent was inserted into a normal
rabbit esophagus; the tissue reaction in the nor-
mal esophagus may differ from that in an esopha-
geal stricture. (b) Effective support was provided
for only 2 weeks; further research is required to
delay biodegradation and improve the duration of
support. (c) This stent should be applied in a
BSE model to investigate fully its feasibility, effi-
cacy, and tissue reaction in vivo.
