Abstract
Edaravone is clinically used for treatment of patients with acute cerebral infarction. However, the effect of double application
of edaravone on neurogenesis in the hippocampus following ischemia remains unknown. In the present study, we explored
whether pre- and posttreatment of edaravone had any effect on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subgranular
zone of hippocampus in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia and elucidated the potential mechanism of its
effects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated (n ¼ 15), control (n ¼ 15), and edaravone-
treated (n ¼ 15) groups. Newly generated cells were labeled by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine. Immunohistochemistry was used
to detect neurogenesis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling was used to detect
cell apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescien diacetate assay in NSPCs in vitro.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were quantified by western blot analysis. Treatment
with edaravone significantly increased the number of NSPCs and newly generated neurons in the subgranular zone (p <.05).
Treatment with edaravone also decreased apoptosis of NSPCs (p <.01). Furthermore, treatment with edaravone significantly
decreased ROS generation and inhibited HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein expressions. These findings indicate that pre-
and posttreatment with edaravone enhances neurogenesis by protecting NSPCs from apoptosis in the hippocampus, which is
probably mediated by decreasing ROS generation and inhibiting protein expressions of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 after
cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Global cerebral ischemia is a clinical outcome of cardiac
arrest, severe hypotension, or certain operations, such as
cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral intervention, which
deprive the brain of oxygen and glucose. It causes severe
damage to pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region and
usually results in residual neurological deficits following
recovery from ischemia (Pulsinelli and Brierley, 1979;
Nitatori et al., 1995). The subgranular zone (SGZ) of
the dentate gyrus (DG) is the most important

regenerative center in the hippocampus. Neural stem/
progenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from the SGZ migrate
into the DG of the hippocampus, where some of them
mature into granule neurons. This neurogenesis process is
important for learning and synaptic plasticity under
physiological conditions (Iscru et al., 2013). Increased
neurogenesis originating from NSPCs in the SGZ of the
adult brain has been observed in a variety of mammals
and humans following cerebral ischemia (Eriksson et al.,
1998; Gage, 2000). The capacity of the adult brain to
induce spontaneous neurogenesis is closely associated
with recovery after ischemia (Liu et al., 1998; Nakatomi
et al., 2002; Sharp et al., 2002; Alvarez-Buylla and Lim,
2004; Di Filippo et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Thus,
neuroprotective and neurorestorative medication for
treatment after cerebral ischemia should be developed.
Apoptosis is an essential process that occurs during
normal development to maintain homeostasis and
occurs under pathological conditions (Guan et al.,
2009). After global cerebral ischemia, the larger part of
the newly generated NSPCs in the hippocampus dies
through apoptosis within weeks (Bingham et al., 2005;
Sun et al., 2012). Caspases are a family of cysteine pro-
teinases that play a central role in the control of apoptosis
(Springer et al., 2001; Jin et al., 2003). Activation of cas-
pase-3 results in the degradation of a number of intracel-
lular and cytoskeletal protein substrates as part of an
ordered process of cellular disassembly, leading to
apoptotic cell death (Mancini et al., 1998; Sun et al.,
1999). In addition, caspase-3 mediates the loss of neurons
in the CA1 region and neurogenic cells in the SGZ
(Bingham et al., 2005), and there is a causal relationship
between hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and cas-
pase-3 induction via HIF-1a functional binding to the
caspase-3 gene promoter (Van Hoecke et al., 2007).
Moreover, accumulating evidence shows the involvement
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the activation of sig-
naling components upstream of HIF-1a, such as hydro-
xylases and kinases (Hwang et al., 2008; Koshikawa
et al., 2009).
Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a
free radical scavenger that can cross the blood­brain bar-
rier and interact with a variety of free radicals to reduce
ROS generation (Aoyama et al., 2008). Edaravone has a
neuroprotective role in focal cerebral ischemia in animals
and in patients suffering from acute cerebral infarction
(Kawai et al., 1997; Amemiya et al., 2005; Watanabe
et al., 2008). However, the effect of pre- and posttreat-
ment with edaravone on neurogenesis in the hippocam-
pus after transient global cerebral ischemia is unknown.
In the present study, we investigated whether edaravone
administration had any effect on NSPCs in the SGZ after
transient global cerebral ischemia and explored whether
intracellular ROS and the HIF-1 signaling pathway were
involved in the mechanism of action of edaravone.
Materials and Methods
Global Cerebral Ischemia Model
The Experimental Animal Center of Xi'an Jiaotong
University School of Medicine (Certificate No. 22-
9601018) provided all the animals. All studies were con-
ducted in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23). The Animal
Care and Use Committee of Xi'an Jiaotong University
School of Medicine approved the experimental protocols.
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200­250 g,
were maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with free
access to food and water (Zheng et al., 2012). Transient
brain ischemia (10 min) was induced by the four-
vessel occlusion method, as described previously by
Pulsinelli and Brierley (1979) and Yan et al. (2007).
Briefly, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital
sodium (40 mg kgÀ1, intraperitoneally). The vertebral
arteries were irreversibly electrocauterized. The common
carotid arteries were exposed, and a small-diameter silk
thread looped around each artery to facilitate subsequent
occlusion. Rats were allowed to recover for 24 hr.
Transient global cerebral ischemia was induced by simul-
taneously clamping the bilateral common carotid arteries
for 10 min with two microvascular clamps. Rats whose
pupils were dilated and unresponsive to light and that
showed increased respiration were selected for the experi-
ment. Sham-operated rats received the surgical proced-
ures except that the vertebral arteries were not
electrocauterized and the common carotid arteries were
not clamped. Rats in the edaravone group (n ¼ 15)
received an intraperitoneal injection of edaravone
(3.0 mg kgÀ1; Boda, Jilin, China) 30 min before clamping
the common carotid arteries and 30 min after reperfusion.
This treatment schedule and dosage were based on the
pharmacokinetic profile of edaravone supplied by the
manufacturer and previous studies (Shichinohe et al.,
2004; Nakajima et al., 2005; Akiyama and Miwa, 2007;
Lu et al., 2012). Rats in the control group (operated on,
no edaravone treatment; n ¼ 15) or sham-operated group
(n ¼ 15) received intraperitoneal injection of normal
saline using the same volume as the edaravone group.
During ischemia and reperfusion, the rectal temperature
was maintained at 37 Æ 0.5C. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(BrdU, 50 mg kgÀ1; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was injected
intraperitoneally at the onset of global cerebral ischemia
and then once daily for 7 or 14 consecutive days (Zhang
et al., 2001). The rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 21 days
after ischemia by excessive anesthesia, 2 hr after the final
BrdU injection. Neurological score, which is a composite
of motor (muscle status and abnormal movement), sen-
sory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), reflex, and bal-
ance tests, was assessed by a blinded investigator
according to the report by Beck et al. (2007) at 1, 3, 7,
2 ASN Neuro
14, and 21 days after ischemia. A maximum score of 21 is
considered neurologically normal, whereas a score of 0 is
considered as brain dead.
Tissue Preparations and Histological Assessment
Seven, fourteen, and twenty-one days after clamping the
bilateral common carotid arteries, rats of each group
(n ¼ 5 per time point) were killed by excessive anesthesia
with pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally)
and perfused transcardially with normal saline followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The brains were postfixed with 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 24 hr and embedded in paraffin. Finally, each
sample from bregma À2.0 mm to bregma À4.0 mm was
cut into 7 -mm-thick consecutive coronal sections using a
microtome (HM340, Microm, Germany). For histo-
logical assessment, cresyl violet was used to stain the sec-
tions, which were observed under an optical microscope
at 7, 14, and 21 days after ischemia. The length of the
damaged CA1 pyramidal cell layer was measured under
Â 400 magnification and expressed as the percentage of
the entire CA1 subregion. The severity of neuronal
damage was graded as grade 0, no damage to any hippo-
campal subregion; grade 1, scattered ischemic neurons in
the CA1 subregion; grade 2, moderate ischemic damage;
grade 3, whole pyramidal cell damage in the CA1 sub-
region; and grade 4, extensive cell damage in all hippocam-
pal regions (Sugawara et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2009).
Immunohistochemistry and Terminal dUTP
Nick-End Labeling Staining
The tissue sections were subjected to microwave heat-
induced epitope retrieval. After blocking with 4% goat
serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hr, the
sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4C
overnight. The primary antibodies included rat poly-
clonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:1,000; Abcam, UK),
rabbit anti-doublecortin (DCX) polyclonal antibody
(1:1,000; Abcam, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-neuron-
specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody (1:1,000;
Chemicon, USA), and mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibril-
lary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:800; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA). The sections were then washed with
PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies [fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethylrhodamine isothio-
cyanate (TRITC)-conjugated IgG, or biotinylated IgG]
for 2 hr at room temperature. To detect apoptosis of
newly generated cells in the SGZ, the BrdU-stained sec-
tions were labeled using the terminal dUTP nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) assay, according to the instruction of
in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Germany), and
negative/positive controls were also used according to the
instructions. A laser confocal microscope (TSC SP2,
Leica, Manheim, Germany) detected the fluorescence
signals.
NSPC Culture and Hypoxic Exposure
NSPCs were isolated from the cortex of Kunming mice
on gestation Day 14 and cultured in T25 flasks, as
described previously (Chen et al., 2010). After 5­7 days,
the primary neurospheres were mechanically dissociated
and triturated. Single cells were resuspended at a density
of 1 Â 105 cells/mL and cultured for 3 to 4 days (passage 1
neurospheres). Passage 1 cells at a density of 5,000 cells/
mL in serum-free medium were cultured in 96-well plates
for 3 days, and then incubated with edaravone (0 mM or
100 mM, Boda, Jilin, China) under hypoxia (0.3% O2
/
94.7% N2
/5% CO2
) or without edaravone under nor-
moxia (5% CO2
/95% air) for 24 hr, as reported previ-
ously (Chen et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2010; Yoneyama
et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012). An oxygen meter
(CY-100B, Hangzhou Lihua Sci-technology Company,
Hangzhou, China) monitored the percentage of oxygen
in the chamber continuously. The cells were dissociated
using 0.05% trypsin and 200 mM EDTA for 10 min at
37C, followed by 75% ice-cold ethanol fixation
overnight at À20C. Immunocytochemical analysis was
used to characterize the cultured cells. The primary anti-
bodies included mouse monoclonal anti-nestin antibody
(1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), rabbit poly-
clonal anti-HIF-1a antibody (1:1,000; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-b-tubulin III
antibody (1:1000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and
mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (1:800; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The nuclei were counterstained
with propidium iodide (PI, 50 mg/mL; Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). At
least three independent experiments were performed for
each assay.
Measurement of ROS in NSPCs
The dye 2,7-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCF-DA;
Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which is intracellularly oxidized
to the fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescien (DCF) in the
presence of oxidants, was used to measure the relative
levels of cellular peroxides (Lautraite et al., 2003).
NSPCs (1 Â 105 cells/mL) were treated with edaravone
(0 mM or 100 mM) under hypoxia or without edaravone
under normoxia for 24 hr, and then incubated with
DCF-DA (10 mM) for 20 min at 37C and washed three
times with PBS. After centrifugation, the supernatants
were removed, and the cells were resuspended with
PBS. Flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) was used to measure fluorescence at an excita-
tion wavelength of 502 nm and an emission wavelength
of 530.

Western Blot Analysis
To observe HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels,
passage 1 neurospheres were incubated with edaravone
(0 or 100 mM) under hypoxia or without edaravone
under normoxia for 12 hr and 24 hr, respectively. The
neurospheres were collected and used for western blot
analysis, as described previously (Zheng et al., 2012).
The antibodies used included mouse monoclonal anti-b-
actin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), rabbit
polyclonal anti-HIF-1a antibody (1:1,000; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), and rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3
antibody (cleaved, 1:200; Millipore, USA). The enhanced
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific Pierce,
USA) visualized the immunoreactive bands using horse-
radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:5,000;
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The housekeeping protein b-actin
was used as a control. Luminescent signals detected by
the charge-coupled-device camera were transmitted to the
controller unit, and the data were sent to the computer
for analysis and documentation.
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
BrdU-positive cells, DCX-positive cells, BrdU/NeuN,
BrdU/GFAP, BrdU/TUNEL-positive cells in the SGZ,
and histological assessment of both brain hemispheres
were counted blindly in five 7 -mm sections per animal,
spaced 49 mm apart. Fluorescence images were digitized
using laser confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus,
Japan). The density of positive cells was presented as
the total number of positive cells within the SGZ. The
purpose of quantification was not to estimate the total
number, but to obtain a count within the studied regions
to compare between different groups. The measurement
data were presented as means Æ SD and analyzed by two-
tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by
Bonferroni correction. The Mann­Whitney U test
analyzed the histological grading scores of severity of
neuronal damage. The Kruskal­Wallis test was used for
data analysis from cell culture. A p value less than .05
indicated a statistically significant difference.
Results
Treatment With Edaravone Attenuated CA1 Injury
and Improved Neurological Function
To determine the neuroprotective effect of edaravone
against hippocampal neuronal injury, the brains were
evaluated histologically 7, 14, and 21 days after ischemia.
In the sham-operated group, there was no neuronal
loss in the hippocampal CA1 region (Figure 1(a)).
However, pronounced neuronal loss was observed in
the hippocampal CA1 region of the control group 7
days after ischemia (Figure 1(b)). Treatment with edara-
vone significantly attenuated CA1 neuronal damage com-
pared with the control group (Figure 1(c) and (d),
p < .01). There was no significant difference between the
control and the edaravone group 14 and 21 days after
ischemia (p > .05, data not shown). Neurological assess-
ment revealed that all animals displayed the maximum
score of 21 points preoperatively. Sham-operated animals
were not affected by anesthesia or surgical procedure and
retained the maximum score until Day 21 (Figure 1(e)).
There was a significant decrease in the neurological
score in the ischemic animals from Days 1 to 21, com-
pared with the sham-operated group (Figure 1(e),
p < .01). The neurological score was significantly higher
in the edaravone-treated group at Days 1­21 after ische-
mia, compared with the control group (Figure 1(e),
p < .01).
Treatment With Edaravone Increased Neurogenesis
in the SGZ
To detect whether edaravone enhanced neurogenesis
in the SGZ, immunohistochemistry was performed at
different time points after ischemia. In the sham-
operated animals, very few BrdU-labeled cells were
found in the SGZ after injection of BrdU for 7 consecu-
tive days (Figure 2(a)). Following ischemia insult,
increased BrdU-positive cells were found in the SGZ
in both the control and edaravone-treated groups com-
pared with the sham-operated group (Figure 2(b) and
(c)). Additionally, edaravone significantly increased the
number of BrdU-positive cells in the SGZ compared
with the control group during the entire postischemic
period (Figure 2(g)). Furthermore, BrdU-positive
cells coexpressed DCX (Figure 3(a) to (f)) or NeuN
(Figure 4(a) to (f)) in the SGZ, in both the control and
edaravone-treated groups 7 days after ischemia.
However, very few BrdU-positive cells coexpressing
DCX (Figure 3(g) to (i)) or NeuN (Figure 4(g) to (i))
were observed in the SGZ of the sham-operated rats.
The number of DCX-positive cells in the SGZ was not
significantly different between the control and edaravone-
treated groups at 7 days postischemia (Figure 2(h),
p > .05). Interestingly, the number of BrdU-positive
cells expressing NeuN was significantly higher in the
SGZ (50.7 Æ 3.6 cells/SGZ, p < .05) of the edaravone-
treated group compared with the control group at 7
days postischemia (28.4 Æ 1.0 cells/SGZ). The number
of BrdU-positive cells expressing GFAP was not signifi-
cantly different in the SGZ between the edaravone group
(5.8 Æ 0.1 cells/SGZ, Figure 5(d) to (f)) and the control
group (4.0 Æ 0.1 cells/SGZ, Figure 5(a) to (c), p > .05) at
14 days after ischemia. There were no BrdU-positive cells
coexpressing GFAP in the SGZ of the sham-operated
rats (Figure 5(g) to (i)).

Treatment With Edaravone Reduced Apoptosis of
Newly Generated Cells in the Hippocampus
To determine whether edaravone decreased the apoptosis
of newly generated cells, TUNEL and BrdU double
staining was performed at defined time points. There
were two distinct patterns of TUNEL staining; some
TUNEL-stained cells were densely labeled and showed
clear apoptotic characteristics. Other TUNEL-stained
cells were weakly labeled and were considered necrotic
cells. Only densely labeled cells were counted as apop-
totic cells (Charriaut-Marlangue and Ben-Ari, 1995).
In the sham-operated group, almost no BrdUþ/
TUNELþ cells were found in the SGZ (Figure 6(c)).
After ischemia, some of BrdUþ/TUNELþ cells were
observed in the SGZ of the control (Figure 6(a)) and
edaravone-treated groups (Figure 6(b)). The number of
BrdU-positive cells expressing TUNEL was significantly
lower in the SGZ of the edaravone-treated group than
in the control group at all time points examined
(Figure 6(d), p < .05).
Characterization of Cultured NSPCs
Dissociated cells formed neurospheres after 3 days in cul-
ture. The vast majority (96 Æ 2%) of the passage 1 cells
were nestin-positive (Figure 7(a)). After the differenti-
ation assay, a subpopulation of passage 1 cells exhibited
immunoreactivity to GFAP (44 Æ 5%, Figure 7(b)) and
b-tubulin III (21 Æ 3%, Figure 7(c)). After placing pas-
sage 1 cells in the microaerophilic incubation system for
24 hr, the majority (95 Æ 3%) of the passage 1 cells were
nestin-positive (Figure 7(d) to (g)). Only a few cells exhib-
ited immunoreactivity to GFAP (3 Æ 1%, Figure 7(h) to
(j)) or b-tubulin III (2 Æ 1%, Figure 7(k) to (m)).
Furthermore, these nestin-positive cells were HIF-1a
immunoreactive (Figure 7(d) to (g)). These findings sug-
gest that passage 1 cells retain the character of NSPCs

after 24 hr of hypoxia. Spectrophotometric measurement
of BrdU incorporation in vitro showed that BrdU incorp-
oration was increased in hypoxia conditions compared
with normoxic condition (Figure 2(i), p < .01), indicating
that hypoxia stimulated the proliferation of NSPCs.
Edaravone Decreased NSPC Apoptosis and
Declined ROS Generation In Vitro
As shown in Figure 8(a) to (d), hypoxia increased the
proportion of apoptotic cells (p < .01), and edaravone
decreased NSPC apoptosis, as assessed by TUNEL
assay (Figure 8(b) to (d), p < .01). To estimate the effect
of edaravone on ROS generation in NSPCs, passage 1
cells were treated with edaravone (0 mM or 100 mM)
under hypoxia or without edaravone under normoxia
for 24 hr, and endogenous ROS generation was measured
by DCF fluorescence. Hypoxia increased ROS generation
compared with normoxia (Figure 8(e), (f), and (h),
p < .01), and treatment with edaravone led to a significant
reduction in DCF fluorescence compared with the control
group (Figure 8(f) to (h), p < .01). Thus, edaravone sig-
nificantly reduced intracellular ROS generation after hyp-
oxic insult.
Edaravone Decreased the Protein Levels of HIF-1
and Cleaved Caspase-3 in NSPCs
ROS regulates the HIF-1 signaling pathway, depending
on the cell type (Koshikawa et al., 2009). Caspase-3 is one

of the genes regulated by HIF-1 and plays an essen-
tial role in cell apoptosis (Van Hoecke et al., 2007).
To determine whether edaravone decreased HIF-1a
and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels, western blot
analysis was performed at defined time points. Both
HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels significantly
increased in NSPCs at 12 hr and 24 hr following hyp-
oxia compared with normoxic conditions, respectively
(Figure 9(a) and (b), p < .01). NSPCs treated with
edaravone showed a significant decrease in HIF-1a
and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels compared with
untreated cells after hypoxic insult (Figure 9(a) and (b),
p < .01). These results indicated that edaravone inhibited
HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 signaling in NSPCs after
hypoxia.
Discussion
In this study, we found that pre- and posttreatment
with edaravone attenuated CA1 injury and improved the
neurological deficit. Edaravone also increased neurogen-
esis and reduced apoptosis of newly generated cells in the
hippocampus. Furthermore, treatment with edaravone
significantly decreased ROS generation, inhibited the pro-
tein expression of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3, and
reduced apoptosis in NSPCs after hypoxic insult.
These findings indicated that pre- and posttreatment
with edaravone enhances neurogenesis by protecting
NSPCs from apoptosis, probably mediated by decreasing
ROS generation and inhibiting the protein expression of
HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 after cerebral ischemia.

The neuroprotective effects of edaravone on cerebral
injury have been ascribed to its scavenging of ROS, res-
toration of the antioxidant defense mechanisms, and anti-
inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. Accumulating
evidence shows that edaravone ameliorates cortical
edema, reduces the infarct volume, and improves neuro-
logical deficits in rat focal cerebral ischemia, intrace-
rebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury models
(Shichinohe et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2009; Itoh et al.,
2010). However, the neuroprotective effect of edaravone
on global cerebral ischemia has not been assessed. In ger-
bils subjected to 5 min transient forebrain ischemia,
administration of edaravone 30 min before ischemia atte-
nuated neuronal damage and improved behavioral def-
icits (Lu et al., 2012). By contrast, edaravone
administered either immediately or 60 min after ischemia
did not change the neurological deficits score in a rat
model of global cerebral ischemia induced by 5 min of
cardiac arrest and resuscitation (Kubo et al., 2009). Our
observation that treatment with edaravone reduced the
neuronal damage of CA1 region and improved neuro-
logical deficits in rats subjected to 10 min global cerebral
ischemia is in agreement with a previous study where
edaravone effectively alleviated brain injury and
improved the neurological function after focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury (Kikuchi et al., 2009). The
discrepancies between outcomes may be related to differ-
ent global cerebral ischemia models and time of admin-
istration used in these studies. Our regimen might be
valuable for using edaravone in patients with high risk

of predictable global cerebral ischemia, such as cardiac
arrest, severe hypotension, or cardiopulmonary bypass.
Protection and amplification of the endogenous neuro-
genesis expand the possibility of novel neuronal cell
regeneration therapies for stroke and other neurological
diseases (Bellenchi et al., 2012; Saha et al., 2012). In our
study, cerebral ischemia promoted neurogenesis in the
SGZ, and edaravone administration increased BrdU-
labeled cells and BrdU þ /NeuN þ cells in the SGZ after
10 min of global cerebral ischemia, indicating that
edaravone enhances hippocampal stem/progenitor cell
neurogenesis. Interestingly, there was no difference in
the number of DCX-positive cells in the SGZ at 7 days
postischemia between the control and edaravone-treated
groups, indicating that edaravone promoted maturation
of new neurons. It was reported that BrdU-positive cells
expressing DCX reached their maximum number
between the 4th and 7th day after ischemia; thereafter,
DCX expression rapidly declined, and then expression of
NeuN slowly increased (Brown et al., 2003). Our findings
are similar to those of a study showing that edaravone
promotes proliferation of neural progenitor cells gener-
ated following neuronal loss in the mouse DG (Kikuta
et al., 2013) and restores the differentiation of human
neural precursor cells following X-irradiation (Ishii
et al., 2007). Furthermore, improvement in behavioral
deficits was observed in the edaravone-treated rats.
However, edaravone administration did not alter gliogen-
esis at Day 14 postischemia. In contrast to our previous
report that treatment with edaravone decreased

neurogenesis in the ischemic ipsilateral subventricular
zone (SVZ) in a focal cerebral ischemia model (Zhang
et al., 2012), the discrepancy can be attributed to the dif-
ferent response of NSPCs in the DG and SVZ to cerebral
ischemia/hypoxia. It has been reported that transient
global cerebral ischemia significantly increases neurogen-
esis in the dentate SGZ, but not in the SVZ (Liu et al.,
1998). Cell proliferation in the SVZ returned to normal
levels; however, that in the SGZ showed a twofold increase
4 weeks following intermittent hypoxia (Zhu et al., 2005).
Taken together, the results suggest that neuroprotection of
NSPCs by edaravone in the DG and SVZ is different.
Global cerebral ischemia resulted in a decrease of
oxygen tension in the hippocampus (Freund et al.,
1989). Following reperfusion, oxygen tension recovered
within 1 hr in the hippocampus and fell again, often
below the lowest level seen during the ischemic period,
which initiated histological damage observed after 24 hr
(Freund et al., 1989; Dijkhuizen et al., 1998). Both hyp-
oxia and free radicals induce apoptosis in cultured
NSPCs (Tamm et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010). We
observed that treatment with edaravone markedly
decreased NSPC apoptosis in the hippocampus after
ischemia, which agreed with a report that edaravone
protected neural progenitor cells in the SGZ of the hippo-
campus from cell death after X-irradiation (Motomura
et al., 2010). Additionally, we simulated the oxygen
levels in the hippocampus following global cerebral ische-
mia/reperfusion to investigate the effect of edaravone on
NSPC apoptosis and its potential mechanism in vitro
(Chen et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012).
Hypoxia stimulated proliferation of NSPCs, and treat-
ment with edaravone increased hypoxia-induced NSPC
proliferation (data not shown) and decreased cell apop-
tosis and ROS generation, indicating that enhanced SGZ
neurogenesis by edaravone treatment was partly attribu-
ted to reduced cell apoptosis. It was reported that ROS
induced HIF-1a expression through PI3K-PKB/Ak
signaling (Charriaut-Marlangue and Ben-Ari, 1995).
HIF-1a is involved in ischemia/hypoxia-induced cell
death events by activating the expression of various
pro-death genes during sustained or severe ischemia/hyp-
oxia (Wang et al., 2004). A previous study suggested that
there was a causal relationship between HIF-1a and

caspase-3 induction via HIF-1a functional binding to the
caspase-3 gene promoter (Van Hoecke et al., 2007). In
our study, treatment with edaravone led to a decrease
in intracellular ROS generation, decreased protein levels
of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 and reduced NSPC
apoptosis under hypoxia, indicating that administration
of edaravone protect NSPCs from apoptosis, probably by
inhibiting HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 pathway.
In conclusion, using a model of transient cerebral
ischemia and hypoxic culture of NSPCs, we found that
pre- and postadministration of edaravone mitigated hip-
pocampal CA1 injury and enhanced neurogenesis by pro-
tecting NSPCs from apoptosis, which was probably
mediated by decreasing ROS generation and inhibiting
protein expressions of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3
after cerebral ischemia. Our results suggest a novel
ROS-dependent HIF-1a-mediated caspase-3 activation
pathway that leads to NSPC apoptosis and provides an
experimental basis for the use of edaravone as a prevent-
ive and protective drug against global cerebral ischemia.
