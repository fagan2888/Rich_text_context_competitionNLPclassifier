Relevant to Clinical Guidelines in Germany
and the United Kingdom: (What) Can We
Learn From Each Other?

Abstract
We conducted a systematic review of clinical guidelines (CGs) to examine the methodological approaches of quality indicator
derivation in CGs, the frequency of quality indicators to check CG recommendations in routine care, and clinimetric
properties of quality indicators. We analyzed the publicly available CG databases of the Association of the Scientific Medical
Societies in Germany (AWMF) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Data on the methodology
of subsequent quality indicator derivation, the content and definition of recommended quality indicators, and clinimetric
properties of measurement instruments were extracted. In Germany, no explicit methodological guidance exists, but 3
different approaches are used. For NICE, a general approach is used for the derivation of quality indicators out of quality
standards. Quality indicators were defined in 34 out of 87 CGs (39%) in Germany and for 58 out of 133 (43%) NICE CGs.
Statements regarding measurement properties of instruments for quality indicator assessment were missing in German and
NICE documents. Thirteen pairs of CGs (32%) have associated quality indicators. Thirty-four quality indicators refer to
the same aspect of the quality of care, which corresponds to 27% of the German and 7% of NICE quality indicators. The
development of a standardized and internationally accepted methodology for the derivation of quality indicators relevant to
CGs is needed to measure and compare quality of care in health care systems.

Introduction
Since To Err Is Human1 in 2000, efforts on the measurement
and gradual improvement of the quality of medical treatment
have been important parts of health care systems. The assur-
ance and steady development of quality of care is a nation-
wide aim of national funded and voluntary initiatives in many
countries and health care systems around the world.2-5 For
several years, these efforts have been complemented by vari-
ous research activities in the fields of health services and
implementation research.6 With regard to high-quality care,
great importance was ascribed to clinical guidelines (CGs).7
CGs provide a widespread and well-established method to
disseminate systematic and structured recommendations for
patient care.8 The recipients of the recommendations com-
prise outpatient, inpatient, and rehabilitative care and there-
fore a large proportion of medical care providers. The
recommendations are based on the best available evidence at
the time of creation. The responsibility for and applied meth-
ods of CG development differ internationally. Germany and
the United Kingdom constitute 2 examples for the develop-
ment of CGs. The classification of German CGs is divided
according to the approach to their development and contains
3 grades: S1, S2 (separated in S2e [evidence] or S2k [consen-
sus]), and S3 (systematic evidence synthesis and consecutive
structured consensus).9 The development of CGs is carried
out through voluntary initiatives of medical societies or in
funded structured CG programs (Disease Management

Guidelines and German Guideline Program in Oncology).
Both are hosted by the Association of the Scientific Medical
Societies in Germany (AWMF). In the United Kingdom, CGs
are developed and disseminated in 3 different frameworks
through the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) for England and Wales, the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN) for Scotland, and the Guidelines
and Audit Implementation Network (GAIN) for Northern
Ireland. We only include CGs of NICE because of their wide-
spread dissemination. NICE was established in 1999 by the
government to "reduce variation in the availability and qual-
ity of National Health Service treatments and care."10
Different approaches and tools are used in routine prac-
tice to measure the quality of medical care. Quality indica-
tors are most commonly used to determine the quality of
care.11,12 Defined reference intervals distinguish between dif-
ferent levels of health care quality. Data to define reference
intervals may be derived from the literature, expert opinions,
or statistical specifications.13 Quality indicators are instru-
ments to measure structural, processual, and outcome quality
in routine care.14 They are thus measurement instruments
that can be expressed as definitions, single-item instruments,
or multi-item instruments. They must meet specific require-
ments, such as clear definitions, rationale for use, and a
transparent definition process to achieve conclusive results.
For process and outcome quality indicators that are measured
by measurement instruments, those requirements include cri-
teria of methodology and feasibility.15 Methodological crite-
ria are clinimetric properties, that is, content validity,
construct validity, internal consistency, interobserver reli-
ability, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to change/
responsiveness.16,17 Feasibility/acceptability criteria include
the level of implementation of procedures or the sustainabil-
ity of treatment recommendations for the quality of care.15
The rigorous and transparent development of meaningful
quality indicators with high validity, reliability, and feasibility is a
prerequisite for an evidence-driven development of health care
systems toward medical care that is safer, more effective, and
more efficient.18,19 Ideally, processual and outcome quality indi-
cators for the same medical problem should be comparable across
healthcaresystemstoallowinternationalcomparisonsasanaddi-
tional source of evidence for health care system research and
development. Quality indicators for structural quality can differ
according to the economic or health care system environment.
The aims of the present study were (1) the systematic analysis and
comparison of the methodological approaches in the develop-
ment of quality indicator recommendations relevant to CGs in
Germany and NICE and (2) the critical appraisal of the content,
validity, and reliability of CG-recommended quality indicators
between the 2 countries with a specific focus on quality indicators
from pairs of guidelines on the same medical problem.
Methods
We undertook a systematic review on all German S3 guide-
lines (effective November 30, 2013)20 and all NICE CGs
(effective April 1, 2014). The relevant literature was inde-
pendently searched and assessed by 2 reviewers, and relevant
information concerning quality indicators was extracted in a
standardized manner. We analyzed the publicly available CG
databases of the AWMF and NICE. Following an a priori
defined protocol, we extracted the following information
from each available, valid and published CG identified: cor-
responding, leading, or first author; year published; number
of defined quality indicators; and quality dimensions accord-
ing to Donabedian,14 that is, indicator for structure, process,
or patient outcome quality. The extracted data were summa-
rized on CG level, for German CG on the level of the meth-
odological approaches and for NICE CG on the level of the
title of the related quality standard and the year of whose
publication. If the independent reviewers (T.P., S.D.)
extracted different information, a third reviewer (J.S.) was
consulted and the information was discussed.
Further analyses were conducted for pairs of CG. Analyses
of quality indicators of pairs of CG focusing on identical medi-
cal problems were compared according to the content of the
quality indicators, the methodology used to define quality indi-
cators, data sources of quality indicators, the rationale and CG
recommendation of the quality indicators, and their clinimetric
properties. For NICE quality indicators, also the information of
the quality standard was extracted and analyzed. Quality stan-
dards are used to develop outcome measures which represent
the quality of care for a specific medical problem.5 The rele-
vance of the different clinimetric properties differs between
quality indicators which are based either on definitions or on
(latent) constructs. Thus, the relevant clinimetric properties for
quality indicators were categorized as shown in Figure 1.
In addition, the methodology manuals of the German and
NICE CG developers were analyzed to identify instruments
for measuring the feasibility of guidelines concerning the
assessments of the quality indicator recommendations.
The execution of a risk of bias assessment was not possi-
ble due to the research question and the information sources.

Methodology of Quality Indicator Derivation in CGs
The definition and dissemination of quality indicators rele-
vant to CGs occurs both in Germany and NICE.20-24 The rec-
ommended methodology of the derivation of quality
indicators differed between Germany and NICE.
In Germany, 3 groups developed CGs with different
methodological approaches:
·
· Voluntary initiatives of medical societies (VIMS)
·
· The Disease Management Guidelines (DMG)
·
· The German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO).
In DMG und GGPO, quality indicators are derived from CG
recommendations graded "A" or with the syntax/modality
"shall." In voluntary CG initiatives of medical societies, the
Petzold et al 3
process of quality indicator derivation is not described. In the
funded structured German CG programs DMG und GGPO,
quality indicators were derived from CG recommendations
(Figure 2). Existing quality indicators pertaining to specific
medical issues were identified by a systematic literature search
and evaluated by experts with the help of the QUALIFY
instrument.25 The QUALIFY instrument provides guidance
for the structured assessment of quality indicator development
and validation. Selected experts are asked for each quality
indicator to assess the following:
·
· Relevance: importance of the quality characteristic
captured by the quality indicator for patients and the
health care system, benefit, consideration of potential
risks/side effects
·
· Scientific soundness/indicator evidence: clarity of
definition, reliability, ability of statistical differentia-
tion, risk adjustment, sensitivity, specificity, validity;
·
· Feasibility: interpretability for patients and the inter-
ested public; interpretability for physicians and
nurses; indicator expression can be influenced by pro-
viders; data availability; data collection effort; barri-
ers for implementation considered; correctness of data
can be verified; completeness of data can be verified;
complete count of data sets can be verified.25
According to the QUALIFY instrument,25 positively rated quality
indicators shall be linked to guideline recommendations.21
There is no standard specifying at what stage in the pro-
cess of the guideline work quality indicators are to be selected
for recommendation. The definition of quality indicators in
voluntary initiatives of medical societies is optional. In DMG
and GGPO, a systematic approach is pursued,21,22 which is
based on a systematic review of existing and used quality
indicators. The detected quality indicators are derived only
for strong CG recommendations or with the syntax/modality
"shall" and evaluated by an expert committee applying the
QUALIFY instrument (Figure 2).
In England and Wales, the NICE will be mandated to
develop CGs together with medical societies and organiza-
tions. Out of these CGs, quality standards were derived in
which quality statements are described. The quality state-
ments are based on CG recommendations from NICE and
other organisations.24 Quality standards are associated with
the CG and a concise set of measurable quality statements to
improve the quality of care in a particular area of health care.
Quality statements are composed of quality indicators to
measure specific structures, processes, or outcomes in health
care.26 Quality indicators are clearly defined27 and critically
appraised and evaluated by experts with regard to their utility
for the sustainable CG implementation. For new quality stan-
dards in new settings or services, a field testing in the form of
consultation is recommended. The consultation includes
examining the relevance, utility, clarity, potential impact,
and the acceptability of the quality standards with providers,
payers, and patients.28 The comments of providers, payers,
and patients as results of the field testing are discussed by the
Quality Standard Advisory Committee (QSAC). The quality
standard is refined with the input from providers, payers, and
patients and the QSAC members. This is followed by the
process of internal quality assurance, consistency checking,
and approval by an associate director in the NICE quality

standard team. This is to ensure the validity of the content
prior to the publication of the quality standards (Figure 2).
The Department of Health determines new relevant public
health topics and requests NICE to develop quality standards.
New topics for CGs and quality standard development are

Quality Indicator Recommendations
In Germany, 183 S3 CGs (effective November 30, 2013)
were identified. Eighty-seven of 183 S3 CGs are available
and published. The remaining 96 S3 CGs were preliminarily
registered or under revision and therefore not included in fur-
ther analyses.
In 34 (39%) of the included 87 CGs, quality indicators
have been defined (Figure 3), with a total of 394 quality indi-
cators being recommended (2-52 per CG). Three hundred
forty-one quality indicators in 29 CGs (85%) reported infor-
mation on the precise definition (numerator and denomina-
tor).TherationaleandCGrecommendationweredocumented
in 5 CGs (15%). Fifty-eight quality indicators (15%) are
based on an underlying construct (single- or multi-item
instrument) as measurement basis. Three hundred thirty-six
quality indicators (85%) are based on definitions by quality
indicator developers. Statements regarding data source and
clinimetric properties of quality indicators were reported for
none of the 394 quality indicators. Twenty-one (5%)
recommended quality indicators measure structural quality,
340 (86%) processual quality, and 33 (8%) outcome quality
(Online Supplemental Table 3).
From NICE CGs, a total of 133 CGs and 58 quality stan-
dards were available (effective April 1, 2014), all of which
recommended quality indicators relevant to CG (Figure 3).
A total of 1795 quality indicators (9-78 per CG) were
included in the 58 identified quality standards. All quality
indicators out of quality standards that are relevant to CG
were derived from CG recommendations.24,29 For all qual-
ity indicators, information on numerator, denominator, data
source, rationale, and CG recommendation of the quality
indicators was provided. Four hundred eleven quality indi-
cators (23%) are based on single- or multi-item instruments
and 1384 (77%) on definitions. As in German CG, state-
ments regarding clinimetric properties of the defined qual-
ity indicators are missing for all quality indicators
recommended. All quality indicators out of quality stan-
dards that are relevant to CG were tested, if they are appli-
cable for routine care. The results of the pilot testing were
collected at NICE and used to improve the quality indica-
tor, for example, suitability of the data source. The results
of the field testing were not listed in the quality standard
report. Six hundred ninety-nine (39%) recommended qual-
ity indicators measure structural quality, 717 (40%) process
quality, and 379 (21%) outcome quality (Online
Supplemental Table 3).

Analysis of Quality Indicators Related to Pairs of
NICE and German CGs
Forty-one of the German and British CGs focus on the same
medical problem. Thirteen of these 41 pairs of CGs include
quality indicators (Table 1). In these 13 pairs, a total of 128
quality indicators were defined in German CGs. A total 468
quality indicators were defined in NICE CGs. Four (3%) of
the 128 quality indicators of German CG embrace structural
quality, 112 (88%) process quality, and 12 (9%) outcome
quality. One hundred seventy-two (37%) indicators relevant
to NICE CGs capture structural quality, 232 (50%) process
quality, and 64 (14%) outcome quality (Table 2).
In the 13 pairs of CGs related to identical medical prob-
lems, 34 quality indicators refer to the same aspect of the
quality of care. This corresponds to 27% (34 of 128) of the
German quality indicators and 7% (34 of 468) of NICE qual-
ity indicators. Ten of 13 German CGs are exclusively process
indicators compared with 0 of 13 for NICE. The rationales
for quality indicator recommendation also differed substan-
tially. Twenty-three of 34 rationales refer to the same aspect
of quality of care. German and NICE quality indicators differ
in 11 rationales. Rationale is a statement in which the spe-
cific aspect of health care is described, assessed by the qual-
ity indicator.30 In the following CGs, there was a similar
alignment of quality indicators: depression in adults. In this
pair of CGs,31,32 the severity of symptoms was considered as
a measurable outcome in Germany and by NICE. In other
CGs such as those for psoriasis,33 no common objectives of
quality indicators in NICE and German CGs were identified.
In the German CGs, the average Psoriasis Area Severity
Index (PASI),34 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),35
and the inability to work are measured as the defined quality
indicators.33 In the corresponding NICE CG "Psoriasis,"36 15
quality indicators were recommended to measure disease
severity at diagnosis; the impact of the disease on physical,
psychological, and social well-being at diagnosis; and the
receipt of diagnostic measures.36

Discussion
This systematic review highlights substantial differences in the
process and methodology of quality indicator development and
recommendation between German and NICE CGs. While in
Germany 3 different methodological approaches are applied,
one common approach is applied in NICE. Quality indicators
from NICE CGs have the advantage that unambiguous defini-
tions, data sources, and information on pilot tests are available.
Such information would be helpful for quality indicators in
German CGs as well to sustainably improve quality measure-
ment according to CGs. Therefore, CG developers in Germany
would benefit from a standardized methodology for the deriva-
tion of quality indicators relevant to CGs. Quality indicators
are measureable indicators of CG implementation to ascertain
the improvement of structures, processes, and outcomes in
health care. This is why the methodology of quality indicator
derivation has to meet standards as high as those for the devel-
opment of CG recommendations. Other studies37,38 that exam-
ined quality indicators in CG focused also on sophisticated,
evidence-driven methodology of measureable endpoints.
The developmental process and the evaluation of quality
indicators in routine care are important steps of quality measure-
ment and improvement. The methodological approaches of the
German DMG, GGPO, and NICE represent a structured and
transparent approach to the development of quality indicators in
CGs. Voluntary CG initiatives of medical societies, which
develop the vast majority of S3 CGs in Germany (82%), have
currently no clear methodological guidance on how to derive
quality indicators based on CG recommendations. As 2 similar
methodological approaches (DMG and GGPO) already exist in
Germany, a corresponding methodology should be developed
and published to support medical societies. There is no defined
procedure in all 4 methodological approaches (3 from Germany,
1 from NICE) for the evaluation of quality indicators. In the
NICE CG manual, a collection of feedback is reported, which
influences the updating process of the quality indicators.Aclini-
metric testing of the quality indicators in routine care is not pro-
vided in any methodology. As a consequence, no statements on
the quality of the quality indicators are available. This is an
important limitation as we know from evidence-based medicine
that measurement instruments of unclear quality overestimate,
underestimate, or misjudge quality effects of interventions.12
Three hundred ninety-four quality indicators were found in
German CGs and 1795 in CGs of NICE. The majority of these
quality indicators (86% in Germany and 40% of NICE) are
used to measure process quality. Only 8% in German CGs and
21% of NICE CGs of the defined quality indicators measure
outcome quality. The measurement of health care outcomes is
of great interest, especially for patients and their relatives.
Also health insurance funds need data on outcome quality to
support their assured when choosing a service provider or
single treatment options. Quality indicators should be based
on health care data to derive realistic treatment options. The
majority of quality indicators (85% in German CGs and 77%
in NICE CGs) are based on definitions of experts or develop-
ers. The use of single- or multi-item instruments would be
helpful to prove the goodness of quality indicators.
This systematic analysis of CGs identified pairs of German
and British CGs focusing on the same medical issue. However,
the quality indicators recommended in these pairs of CGs dif-
fer in their quantity, definition, and rationale. The rationale
and CG recommendations are relevant for the derivation of
quality indicators. In Germany, it is unclear which guideline
recommendations are used to derivate quality indicators.
The missing objectives for health care performance and
outcomes in Germany are a possible reason for the develop-
ment and implementation different quality measures. Only
with distinct objectives for health care can measurable, rele-
vant and sustainable endpoints of health care be developed
and implemented. In the United Kingdom, health care objec-
tives exist to improve the patient safety and quality of health
and health care, whereas no common health care objectives
exist in Germany.39
Both in CGs from NICE and from Germany, information
on clinimetric properties of the quality indicators recom-
mended, that is, information on their validity and reliability, is
missing. However, such information on quality indicators is
crucial for their implementation in routine care and a neces-
sary prerequisite to obtain resilient and convincing results.20,40
Therefore, a standardized method appears necessary in both
countries for the implementation of these requirements.
Core Outcome Sets (COS) could be a possibility to derive
quality indicators related to CG. COS represent the mini-
mum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported
in investigations or analyses of a specific medical issue. This
is a necessary prerequisite to compare results of studies and
to optimize the use of research evidence for clinical decision
making. COS are being increasingly developed for clinical
trials and effectiveness studies, on the basis of a systematic
appraisal of research evidence and consensus by an (interna-
tional) multidisciplinary expert panel.41 The COMET (Core
Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials; www.comet-ini-
tiative.org) Initiative provides an overview of existing
COS.42,43 Core outcome domains should be assessed with
adequate measurement instruments, that is, instruments with
high validity, reliability, and responsiveness.44,45 A roadmap
for the systematic development and implementation of
COS46,47 hasbeensuggestedbytheinternationalHarmonizing
Outcomes for Eczema (HOME) initiative.48 Currently, the
development of quality indicators from German CGs does
not include the review of an existing COS for the clinical
problem. This might be an effective strategy to translate clin-
ical outcomes into patient-relevant quality indicators to be
used in routine care, as done in NICE CG program.
We furthermore suggest to apply the COS principle in the
field of quality assurance. National Core Indicator Sets applied
in different settings and fields might help set the agenda for
process development in health care. An international COS of
quality indicators would allow comparisons between different
8 INQUIRY
health care systems.Afirst comparison of the overlap between
COS and the quality indicators defined in pairs of CG from
Germany and NICE concerning the same medical condition
identified 3 areas in which a COS as well as quality indicators
from German and NICE guidelines exist (effective December
20, 2013). These 3 medical fields are prophylaxis of venous
thromboembolism,49 asthma,50 and low back pain.51,52 These 3
medical fields might be a good starting point for a comprehen-
sive international process to bridge the assessment of effec-
tiveness in trials with quality assurance in routine care and
thus to help overcome the evidence-practice gap.
The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation
(AGREE) instrument was developed for the methodical evalu-
ation of CG and is internationally applied.53 A translation for
German guidelines exists Deutsches Leitlinien-Bewertungs-
Instrument (DELBI).54 These 2 checklists determine the qual-
ity of CG. Both instruments contain criteria for the evaluation
of CG recommendations. These criteria do not refer to quality
indicators related to CG. The sustainability of the treatment
recommendations in CG is not guaranteed and does not appear
in the form of quality indicators in AGREE or DELBI.
Evaluated and sustainable CG recommendations are necessary
for the methodological quality of CG and their implementation
in routine care. Quality indicators could be a suitable method to
attest the sustainability in routine care.
Strengths and Limitations of This Study
We applied systematic review methodology to guarantee
completeness and validity of the information extracted from
CG. The study was conducted based on a priori defined inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. A systematic literature search in
relevant CGs was independently assessed by 2 reviewers, and
relevant information concerning quality indicators was
extracted in a standardized manner. After comparing the data
extraction and consensus discussion, the evidence synthesis
took place. A limitation of the work is possibly the restriction
in German guidelines on the group of the S3 CGs. These are
evidence- and consensus-based and currently represent the
gold standard for CG in Germany. Therefore, a transfer of the
results of our work to other German guidelines may be lim-
ited, and the proportion of guidelines with formulated quality
indicators in S1 and S2 CGs may be different. The systematic
review was carried out between 30.11.2013 and 30.04.2014.
Since that period, the NICE quality standard program has
been advanced with 115 published NICE quality standards.
We did not extend our data set because in-depth analyses of
CG-recommended quality indicators are highly time-con-
suming. Furthermore, adding further quality standards is not
likely to contribute more substantial insights.
Implications for Future Research
The comparison of quality indicators in German and NICE
CGs emphasized that different quality indicators are defined
and used in Germany and NICE for similar medical conditions.
One possible reason could be the different structures of the
underlying health care systems. The different methodologies
used to derive quality indicators related to CGs may represent
another issue. To enable a learning system of quality measure-
ment with the help of CGs, an international forum should be
established. The Guidelines International Network (GIN;
www.g-i-n.net) could serve as a suitable organization for pro-
moting the issue of quality measurement in international CGs.
A uniform and internationally accepted methodology for the
derivation of quality indicators in CGs should be a major aim.
This approach would allow a first international comparison of
the quality of care in different health care systems.
Conclusion
In Germany and the NICE, almost the same diseases are rep-
resented in the guideline framework. In these CGs, similar
CG recommendations are derived. However, the efficacy of
those recommendations is evaluated with different quality
indicators in Germany and the NICE coverage. A possible
explanation of different quality indicators could be the dif-
ferent approaches are their development. To prove the effi-
cacy of CG recommendations, quality indicators should be
of sophisticated methodological goodness. The clinimetric
properties of all quality indicators recommended in CGs of
NICE and in Germany are unclear. This constitutes a major
risk for inadequate conclusions concerning the quality of
care. The measurement of quality of care for specific medical
conditions requires quality indicators of a high methodologi-
cal quality. An internationally accepted methodological
approach does not exist at present but is necessary for the
derivation of internationally comparable quality indicators in
health care. The idea of Core Quality Indicator Sets could
support quality measurement as it represents an opportunity
to consistently measure relevant indicators of quality of care.
