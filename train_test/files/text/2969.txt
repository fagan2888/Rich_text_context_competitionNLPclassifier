The Multiple Dimensions of Sexual Behavior As Risk Factor for Sexually  Transmitted  Disease:  The Sexually Experienced Are
Not Necessarily  Sexually Active
SEVGI 0.  ARAL,  PHD,  AND  WILLARD  CATES  JR., MD, MPH



Sexual behavior is a crucial risk factor for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but no national data exist to define a true population at risk. Instead, limited information describes sex­ ual behavior in specific population groups (adolescents, women in their twenties) only in terms of a single dimension: sexual experience. To address the multiple dimensions of sexual be­ havior, we analyzed data collected from a nationally represen­ tative sample of reproductive age women in the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). We found 86% of women aged 15-44 to be sexually experienced. Teenagers arc the least experienced (45% and 56% of whites and others, respectively) and the least sexually active of all reproductive women. While sexual experience increases with age, sexual activity shows a curvilinear age pattern: it increases up to age 35 and decreases slightly from age 35 to 44. Teenagers report the least consis­ tent sexual activity (<25%) and the highest level of abstention (38% and 31% for whites and others, respectively) following sexual experience. These findings indicate sexual  experience as a measure of sexual behavior should be further refined to provide a more accurate estimate  of  the  population  at  risk for STD.
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IS obviously a crucial risk factor for STDs. In light of the increasing prevalence of incur­ able viral diseases, especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, modification of sexual behavior
also is emerging as a key intervention for STD preven­ tion and contro l.1· 2 Knowledge of sexual behaviors
within population subgroups is critical both for moni­ toring disease transmission and targeting specific health education and risk reduction messages. The term "sex­ ual behavior" involves many variables: current and life­ time number of sex partners, age at first intercourse, frequency of intercourse, consistency of sexual activity, mode ofrecruitment of sexual partners, and duration of sexual unions. The distribution of these variables in the

  The 1982 National Survey of Family Growth was designed and funded jointly by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), The National Institute for Child Health  and  Human  Development, and the Office of Population Affairs, all of which are U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

population determines aggregate exposure to  the  risk of STD.
  Currently no population-based distribution of sexual behavior in the United States is available. Existing
knowledge is based mostly on studies of college popula­ tions3-5 or convenience sam ples.- 6 8 Two studies that
collected sexual behavior data from nationally represen­ tative samples have focused on adolescent 9 10 and un­ married females aged 20-29.11 As yet, no well estab­ lished, empirically validated measures of sexual behav­ ior are available to serve as indicators of STD risk, especially in aggregated analyses. Previous investiga­ tions have used the crude index of sexual experience, defined as a person's ever having had sexual intercourse,
as the best measure of sexual behavior.12·13
  The lack both of detailed, population-based data and validated behavioral measures has led to several as­ sumptions about the impact of sexual behavior on STD which are only partially supported by empirical evi­ dence. First, because of the inadequate conceptualiza­ tion of the multiple sexual behavior variables, single
measures have been implicitly accepted as an accurate indicator of other behavioral variables. 14·15 This simplis­
tic approach obscures the complexity of sexual choices that put individuals at risk of STD. Second, rates of STD and unwanted pregnancy have been used as general in­ dicators of sexual behavior. These conditions are likely to be poor indicators of sexual behavior to the extent that they are affected either by preventive behaviors, as with unwanted pregnancy and incurable viral STD, or
by health care seeking behaviors, as with curable bacte­ rial STD.16 Third, findings from data based on either clinic populations 17 or on specific age groups, such as teenagers,9·10 have been  generalized  to the entire sex­
ually  active  population,  in  spite  of  both the selective
nature of clinic populations and the age-dependent na­ ture of sexual behavior.18 Finally, the focus on statistical

measures of central tendency, such as average age at first intercourse or mean number of sexual partners, has ig­ nored the heterogeneity of sexual behavior across and within population subgroups. 19 Because of the existence of identifiable STD core populat ions,20 21 the more vari­ able statistical measures of modality and skewness are probably critical to understanding the role of sexual be­ havior as an STD risk factor.
  In this article, we present estimates of sexual experi­ ence, juxtaposed with measures of sexual activity from a large, population-based nationally representative sam­ ple of women. We also analyze the consistency and fre­ quency of sexual activity by age and race. We found that the usual index of sexual behavior-sexual experience
-can be further refined to more specifically indicate STD risk, especially in women.

Methods
  We obtained data for this analysis from both a recent report22 and unpublished information from the  Na­ tional Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle III, con­ ducted in 1982 by the National Center for Health Sta­ tistics (NCHS). The NSFG is a periodic survey of repro­ ductive age women designed to provide information on factors affecting childbearing and maternal and child health.23 The Cycle III survey was carried out with a multistage area probability sample of7,969 women aged 15-44 in the United States.
  The primary purpose of the NSFG is to measure de­ terminants of birth and pregnancy rates. The data on exposure to intercourse were collected to measure the risks of contraceptive failure, unintended  pregnancy, and infertility. The data were based on responses  to three questions: first, women who had never been preg­ nant and never been married were asked whether they had ever had intercourse; second, women who had ever had intercourse were asked which months during the 3½ years before the interview they had not had intercourse during a period of one month or more; third, data on frequency of intercourse in the 3 months before the in­ terview were collected to adjust contraceptive failure rates for differences in frequency and to permit analyses of data on women who are infertile or trying to become pregnant. To facilitate recall, these questions were em­ bedded in a series of items on pregnancy history and contraceptive use history; moreover, they anchored key dates by relating them to the timing of significant repro­ ductive events in the respondent's life.
  From these data, we derived four measures of expo­ sure to STD risk: the proportions of women who(]) ever had intercourse, (2) had intercourse in the past  3 months, (3) had intercourse in the past month, and (4) had intercourse at least once every month during the

past 12 months. Our definitions of sexual  experience and frequency of intercourse are direct measures; the questions in the survey dealt specifically with this infor­ mation. We used derived measures to determine levels of sexual activity, including sexually experienced inac­ tivity and consistency of sexual activity. We constructed these measures based on the detailed data collected on periods of ;;;,a I month without sexual intercourse.
  We defined sexual experience as a person's having had sexual ·intercourse at least once in his or her lifetime. Women who had sexual intercourse at least once during the three months prior to the interview were defined as sexually active over a three-month period. Similarly, women who had sexual intercourse at least once during the one month prior to the interview were defined as sexually active over a one-month period. We defined those women who reported having sexual intercourse at least once every month during the 12 months prior to  the interview as being consistently sexually active over the 12-month period. Women who had sexual inter­ course at least once in their lifetime but not over the I month prior to the interview were defined as sexually experienced but inactive (or as experienced abstainers).

Results
Sexual Experience
  Overall, 86% of women aged 15-44 were sexually ex­ perienced. This proportion increased with  increasing age (table I). Teenagers were the least experienced. Among those aged 15-19, only 45% of the white women and 56% of women of other races had ever had sexual intercourse. Among women aged 20-24, 85% of whites and 90% of others were sexually experienced. For all other ages > 24, over 95% of women, white or other, were experienced. While younger white women were less experienced than younger women of other races, between ages 25 and 34 they had more experience.

Sexual Activity
  Using three measures of sexual activity, teenagers again were the least active regardless of the specific ques­ tions asked (table I). Sexual activity among teens ranged from 40% reporting sexual intercourse in the three months prior to interview to just one in seven having regular intercourse every month in the preceding year. The percentage of women who were sexually active in­ creased with increasing age, until age 35. A slight de­ crease in the percentage of sexually active women oc­ curred among women aged 35-44 for whites and among women aged 40-44 for others.
  For all age and race groups, a cascading decrease in sexual activity occurred as definitions became more

stringent. More women were sexually experienced than reported sexual activity during the previous three months, 86% vs. 77% among whites and 88% vs. 78% among all other races, respectively. Sexual activity dur­ ing the previous one month (71%) was less than that during the previous three months (77%), and consistent sexual activity every month over the previous year was the least frequently reported (57%). Among women aged 15-24, those of other races were more likely to be sex­ ually active than white women, but among those aged 25-34 white women were more sexually active by all three definitions of sexual activity. When not stratified by age, the differences by race were small and generally not statistically significant.

Experienced Abstainers
  Conversely, regardless of measure used, teenagers were the most sexually inactive (table 2). Not only were they the least experienced, but teenagers also had a large percentage of experienced abstainers, as did those in the 20-24 age group. By any definition of experienced ab­ stainer, during the teenage years, a larger percentage of white experienced women were abstainers than women of other races. For women aged 20-39 this pattern was reversed: white women were less likely than those of other races to be experienced abstainers.
  The largest change in sexual activity among American women occurs between the teenage years and the late twenties. Both the accumulation of sexual experience and the increase in sexual activity rise markedly from ages 15- l 9 to ages 25-29. Among both whites and others, as age increases, the proportion of those who were both sexually experienced and active increased: the proportion of experienced abstainers declined from 38%

to 12% for whites and from 31% to 17% for all other races between the teenage years and the late twenties.
Frequency of Sexual Intercourse
  Over half of sexually active reproductive women were having sexual intercourse once a week or more (table 3). Among whites the proportion who had intercourse this frequently was lowest (17%) among teenagers and high­ est among those aged 25-29 (69%); it declined during later years to 59% by age 40-44. A larger proportion of whites (53%) compared to women of other races (44%) reported having sexual intercourse this frequently. The race differential occurred consistently at all ages.
Discussion
  Our findings emphasize the vicissitudes of sexual be­ havior. Both as a behavioral characteristic of a popula-

tion and as a risk factor for STD, sexual experience, sexual activity, frequency of sexual intercourse, and consistency of sexual activity are distinct dimensions of sexual behavior with different distributions by age and race. Thus, the use of sexual experience alone in defin­ ing the population at risk for STD is misleading.
  These dimensions may also be affected by marital status. A recent publication from the NCHS22 presents a
detailed discussion of the effects of marital status on sexual activity in our data set. We have not considered marital status in our analysis for three reasons. First, a large proportion of unmarried women have had recent sexual activity; in 1982, 72% of white and 84% of black women who were not currently married had had sexual intercourse within the 3 months preceding the inter­ view. Second, the cultural meaning of marriage differs drastically across subgroups of the population, and these differences are not sufficiently understood to allow accu­ rate interpretations of subgroup differences in the data. Third, marital status is a poor indicator of the nature of sexual activity; for example, among unmarried women, black women were more likely than white women to have had intercourse during the 3 months preceding the interview; however, if they had had intercourse recently, they were less likely to have had intercourse fre­ quently.22
  Certain limitations of our data restrict our efforts to better define the population at risk for STD. First, our analysis represents a secondary use of existing data: the NSFG is designed to measure pregnancy and birth rates, not STD risk. Second, our data come from a cross-sec­ tional survey. As such, we cannot differentiate between age and cohort effects. Thus, the age differences pre­ sented here may reflect either age effects, cohort effects, or interactions between the two. Third, the data items included in the NSFG are limited in sexual behavior

content. Information on numbers of sexual partners and types of sexual practices is important especially in rela­ tion to STD risk. Unlike unplanned pregnancy, which depends on frequency of unprotected intercourse, STDs
are only transmitted by an infected partner.24
  The likelihood of contact with an infected partner is highly determined by the number of partners and who
the partners are.25·26 Previous research  has contributed
only tangential findings in this area. The number of sexual partners within a specific time period, often one or three  months,  has been shown to be a risk factor  for
the transmission of gonorrhea,27 chlamydia,28·29 genital
herpes in fections, 30 hepatitis B virus,25 human papil­ loma virus,31 and human immunodeficiency virus.32- 34
Lifetime number of sex partners is associated with the risk of cervical and other genital cancers.35 More re­
cently, having a new sex partner within the past month was identified as a risk factor for chlamydial infection.28
Finally, age at first sexual intercourse is negatively cor­ related with STD risk. 36
  Recent findings from population-based samples un­ derscore two patterns about the important variable, number of sex partners: (J) it is differentially distributed across race and age groups; and (2) race differences in number of sexual partners do not parallel those in some other dimensions of sexual behavior. For example, compared with black women, white women have greater
numbers of sexual partners even though they initiate sexual activity later in life.11 Combined with findings
that white women also have greater numbers of casual and short duration sexual partnerships,11 the race differ­
entials in number of partners challenge some of the sex­ ual behavior explanations of race differences in STD rates. While of great importance, the number of partners is not the only determinant of likelihood of contact with an infected partner; the sexual behavior of partner(s) is increasingly recognized as an important sexual behavior variable in relation to STD. Infections in monogamous women  point  to the  choice  of sexual  partners as a risk
factor  for STD.16 This variable  is especially important
either when bacterial infections are not cured quickly (due to inadequate utilization of health care or asymp­ tomatic nature of infection) or when lack of cure leads to persistent viral infections.
  Our data indicates that teenagers are generally less sexually active and less consistently so than older women. Similarly, except during the teen years, women of other races are less sexually active and less consis­ tently sexually active than white women. Two possible explanations underlie these patterns: First, general sex­ ual activity among teenagers and older women of other races is marked by sporadicity; second, relatively high levels of sexual activity occur in a relatively small subset of teenagers and women of other races over age 19.

Vol.16No.4	SEXUAL  BEHAVIOR  AS RISK  FACTOR	177

  What factors, then, explain the higher STD morbidity among teenagers and nonwhites? Based on our data, relatively higher levels of sexual activity of all members of these groups is not the explanation. Rather, subsets of these groups appear to account for a large proportion of the morbidity, a finding consistent with the "core group hypothesis" of STD transmission.20 The answer has to be either the existing high STD prevalence in these groups, which makes each unit of sexual activity carry higher risk, or the nature of sexual activity, e.g., number of partners or choice of partners, or both. In fact, the behavioral variables (1) number of partners, (2) indis­ criminant choice of partners, (3) formation of core groups, and (4) high STD prevalence are probably highly and positively correlated.26
  In conclusion, while our data provide refined infor­ mation on the multiple dimensions of sexual behavior, they are still inadequate for accurately portraying the population at risk for STD. Further data on two aspects of sexual behavior-the distribution of number of sex­ ual partners and factors influencing partner choice-are crucial to a better understanding of its effects on STD risk.
