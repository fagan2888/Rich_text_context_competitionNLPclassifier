Abstract
Objective: To investigate tear-film break-up time and spatial distribution via noninvasive
Keratograph 4 in patients with cataracts and dry eye syndrome (DES).
Methods: Noninvasive first break-up time (NIKf-BUT) and average break-up time (NIKav-BUT)
were evaluated via Keratograph 4 in patients with age-related cataracts and DES. The location and
size of tear break regions were recorded and the distribution of first break-up areas was
summarized. Patients also underwent conventional break-up time assessments (TBUT test and
Schirmer's test).
Results: A total of 43 left and 43 right eyes were examined. There was no significant difference
between TBUT and NIKav-BUT. NIKf-BUT was significantly shorter than TBUT. Both NIKf-BUT
and NIKav-BUT correlated positively with TBUT. In both the left and right eye, the most common
first break-up areas were the peripheral domain of the inferior precorneal surface and the central
domain of the superior portion.
Conclusions: The Keratograph 4 appears to provide an effective noninvasive method for
assessing tear film, enabling effective preoperative evaluation of tear film break-up regularity,
informing the location of the incision and reducing the probability of postoperative DES.

Introduction
Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a multifactor-
ial disease that stems from impairment of
the ocular surface and tear ducts, leading
to ocular discomfort and tear film instabil-
ity.1 The incidence of DES is increasing,2
and has an adverse impact on a patient's
health-related quality-of-life, especially
among elderly populations.3,4 Among
patients with age-related cataracts, extrac-
tion surgery or phacoemulsification often
induces DES, 5­7 while intraoperative inci-
sion and heat damage decrease corneal
sensitivity.8,9 In addition, the routine pre-
and postoperative use of eye drops con-
taining antiseptic compounds or steroids
can lead to tear film instability.7 Since the
majority of cataract patients are elderly,
dry eye symptoms may exist preoperatively
and worsen postoperatively. It is therefore
vital to evaluate the condition of the ocular
surface before surgery.10 Eye drops, such
as artificial tears (ARTs), are recom-
mended before and after surgery to prevent
the occurrence of DES and relieve its
symptoms,6,11 but not all cataract patients
need such intervention and there is no
index to assess individual need. Methods
for effective preoperative identification of
patients with pre-existing DES or the
potential for surgery-induced dry eye are
required, and guidelines for the application
of ARTs need to be established.
The conventional tear break-up time test
(TBUT) was introduced in 196912 and has
since been universally applied for dry eye
diagnosis, and used as a standard in many
international diagnostic criteria.13­15 The
fluorescein used in conventional TBUT
may induce reflex tearing and decrease tear
stability,16­18 leading to the development of
noninvasive methods that avoid the limita-
tions of conventional TBUT.16­19 These
include high-speed videotopography,20
meniscometry21 and the tearscope,22 but
these techniques require the subjective
judgement of the examiner, and uniform
criteria for noninvasive break-up time
(NIBUT) remain to be established.
In addition to break-up time, noninvasive
methods that assess tear film distribution,
thickness and dynamic changes could poten-
tially be used to assess tear film stability.23­28
Our previous research29 described a tech-
nique to map tear film thickness using the
PentacamÕ (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany).
The Keratograph 4 (Oculus) noninvasively
measures the first and mean break-up times
without the need for fluorescein, presenting
a colour-coded tear map that dynamically
locates break-up zones, which could not be
achieved previously. The aim of the present
study was to identify the first break-up
zones in patients with cataracts and DES.
In addition, NIBUT (as assessed via
Keratograph 4) was compared with conven-
tional TBUT measurement.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients with bilateral
cataracts and typical DES symptoms (dry-
ness, foreign-body sensation, aesthenopia,
burning, stinging and photophobia),
undergoing cataract surgery at the
Department of Ophthalmology, Eye and
ENT Hospital of Fudan University,
Shanghai, China, between June 2011 and
September 2011. All patients underwent
slit-lamp microscopic examinations and
ophthalmic examinations, including meas-
urements of visual acuity and intraocular
pressure. Exclusion criteria were: (i) non
age-related cataracts (e.g. caused by drug
use or trauma); (ii) pre-existing ocular dis-
ease (uveitis, glaucoma, ocular trauma,
keratitis, etc.); (iii) history of ocular surgery;
(iv) use of eye drops for DES or other ocular
conditions; (v) ocular disorders that influ-
ence the eye surface, such as lid lesions,
lacrimal dust obstruction, allergies, bleph-
aritis and pterygia. Data regarding previous
systemic diseases, and symptoms of dry
Jiang et al. 495
mouth and arthralgia, were collected. The
right eye of odd-numbered patients and the
left eye of even-numbered patients were
chosen for further examination.
The study adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the Eye and
ENT Hospital of Fudan University
(IRB number, KJ2011-21). Verbal informed
consent was obtained from each partici-
pant after the nature and possible conse-
quences of the study were explained to each
patient.
DES diagnosis
Diagnosis of DES was performed according
to Japanese dry eye diagnostic criteria,30
requiring the presence of more than one
subjective symptom (dryness, foreign-body
sensation, burning sensation, photophobia,
visual fatigue or blurred vision, red eye,
etc.), and at least one of the following:
(i) tear film instability (TBUT) 10 s; (ii)
reduced tear production (Schirmer's test31)
5 mm/5 min; (iii) fluorescein staining score
(van Bijsterveld standard31) !1.
Tear film assessment
Tear film assessment with the Keratograph 4
was conducted !30 min before conventional
examinations, in order to avoid any influ-
ence of fluorescein on tear film stability.
Patients were seated at the Keratograph 4 in
a darkened room with the eye focused on the
central target, and a placido disc pattern
comprising 22 illuminated rings was pro-
jected onto the corneal surface. The patient
was asked to blink three or four times and
then keep their eyes open for as long as
possible. The instrument discontinued meas-
urement at the next blink. Irregularities on
the image indicated the instability or break-
up of the tear film. At the same time, a video
was recorded. After completion of each
measurement, the instrument provided a
representation of tear film break-up over
time, including a tear map showing the
location and size of the tear-break regions,
as well as the first break-up time (NIKf-
BUT) and average break-up time (NIKav-
BUT; the mean of all tear film break-ups
occurring over the entire cornea). A single
eye of each patient was examined three
times at 5-min intervals. NIBUT was deter-
mined, as described.17
A representative Keratograph 4 noninva-
sive tear film measurement is shown in
Figure 1. The tear film assessment software
divides the 360 ocular surface into 24 bands
(15 for each band; top right panel,
Figure 1), then subdivides each band into
eight small rectangles (with longitude num-
bers 1­8), each of which serves as a basic
break-up unit. The colour of the unit in a
certain location represents the BUT of this
unit, which changes in colour from red to
yellow to green as BUT increases. In the
present study, the entire 360 precorneal
surface was divided into six areas of 60
each, and each area was divided into two
domains by longitude 4. The domain of each
first break-up unit was recorded.
Break-up time (TBUT) test and
Schirmer's test (without anaesthesia) were
performed. For the TBUT test, a fluores-
cein-impregnated strip was placed in the
patient's lower conjunctival sac after wetting
with nonpreserved saline solution. The
patient was asked to blink three to five
times then keep their eyes open. The time
between the last blink and the appearance of
the first dark dot was recorded as TBUT.
Schirmer's test was carried out by placing a
bent strip beneath the temporal lid margin
and closing the eyes. The strip was removed
after 5 min and the maximum wet length was
measured. A single eye of each patient was
examined three times at 5-min intervals. All
measurements were carried out by the same
trained optometrist (H.F.Y. or Y.X.J.) in
one room, with constant temperature and
humidity.

Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n (%).
Differences between TBUT and NIK-BUT
values were compared using two-sample
Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann­Whitney)
U-test. Between-domain differences in first
break-up location were analysed by
Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel test. The correl-
ation between TBUT and NIK-BUT was
determined using nonparametric Spearman
analysis. Data were analysed with StataÕ/SE
software, version 10.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA). P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 86 patients with age-
related cataracts (46 male/40 female; mean
age 68 Æ 10 years; age range 48­90 years). A
total of 86 eyes (43 right/43 left) were
examined.
Tear break-up time as assessed by TBUT
was significantly longer than NIKf-BUT
(3.54 Æ 0.22 s vs 2.21 Æ 0.23 s; P < 0.001).
There was no significant difference between
TBUT and NIKav-BUT (3.54 Æ 0.22 s vs
4.20 Æ 0.38 s; P > 0.05). Both NIKf-BUT
and NIKav-BUT were positively correlated
with TBUT ( ¼ 0.638, P < 0.001 and
 ¼ 0.528, P < 0.001, respectively).
Figure 2 indicates the location of the first
break-up areas in all 86 eyes (three readings
each). When a first break-up unit was
located in a given domain, it would be
labelled once as a dot in this corresponding
domain. The total number of dots in

Figure 2 exceeds the total number of meas-
urements because, in some eyes, several
units broke simultaneously. The numbers
of first break-up units for different domains
are summarized in Table 1. There was a
significant between-domain difference in
both the right and left eyes (P < 0.001 and
P ¼ 0.0017, respectively). In both eyes, tear
break-up tended to occur earlier in the
peripheral domain of the inferior precorneal
surface (181­360) and the central domain
of the superior portion (61­120) than in any
other region; in most areas, the total first
break-up units were >10%.
Discussion
There is a lack of consensus regarding
noninvasive BUT measurement methodolo-
gies, with some studies indicating that
NITBUT results in significantly higher
values than TBUT,16,32,33 while a tear-
scope-based study found no significant dif-
ference.22 Studies using the Keratograph 4
have resulted in shorter NIBUT than those
determined using tearscope, however.34 In
this study, there was no significant difference
between TBUT and NIKav-BUT, but
TBUT and NIKf-BUT were significantly
different, with the mean NIKf-BUT being
1.33 s shorter than the mean TBUT. This
may be because the Keratograph 4 is cap-
able of recording small and transient break-
up areas that may not be visible to the eye.
Eye drops (such as ARTs) are often
used both pre- and postoperatively in
patients with cataracts, but there are no
treatment guidelines available.
Preoperative NIKf-BUT assessment via
Keratograph 4 would allow identification
of those patients at risk of developing
postoperative dry eye who would benefit
from ART treatment.
The precorneal surface is not evenly
distributed and displays dynamic changes
over time.35,36 Tear break-up has been
shown to occur most frequently in the
temporal and inferior areas37,38 and the
inferior periphery of the cornea.39 Thinner
tear films have been reported to break-up
earlier than thicker regions.40 The tear film is
known to thicken superiorly, to be uni-
formly distributed in the central region and
to thin inferiorly.29,41 In the present study,
the Keratograph 4 was used to record
dynamic video throughout the interblink
period (Figure 1, left panel), during which
time increasing numbers of break-up units
appeared. This dynamic process was repre-
sented in a single plot (Figure 1, upper right
panel), which indicated the locations and
break-up time of each break-up unit.

In the present study, the majority of first
break-up areas occurred in the peripheral
domain of the inferior precorneal surface
(181­360) and the central domain of the
superior portion (61­120); in most areas,
the total first break-up units were >10%.
This pattern may be explained by the fol-
lowing: (i) the effect of surface tension,
which overpowers gravity after the blink;42
(ii) the continuous secretion of tears from
the upper lid; (iii) looseness of the eyelid in
elderly patients, leading to evaporation in
the lower domains. These findings differ
from those of others, who determined that
ocular surface height increased at the super-
ior region over time.43,44 This may be due to
the fact that the Keratograph 4 determines
tear film breakage via thickness measure-
ments, rather than height changes. In add-
ition, the findings of our study may be
different because the participants were cata-
ract patients, in whom visual acuity and
visual quality are relatively low because of
their opacified lenses. Consequently, some
patients may open their eyes more widely,
thereby putting in additional effort to see
clearly, and in turn this might change the
tear-film distribution. We also acknowledge
that the sample size in our study was not
large and this may account for differences in
the findings of the present study compared
with other research. The findings of our
research were simply descriptive observa-
tions. In our research, the diagnosis of dry
eye was still made by establishing the tear-
film break-up time, not by measuring the
tear film break-up area. Our team plans to
conduct additional research and obtain fur-
ther evidence of the predictive and clinical
value of Keratograph 4 examinations.
In conclusion, the determination of
NIKf-BUT and NIKav-BUT via
Keratograph 4 may be useful for predicting
surgically induced dry eye and directing eye-
drop intervention. This noninvasive meth-
odology displays an intuitively colour-coded
tear break-up map, enabling effective
preoperative evaluation of tear film break-
up regularity, informing the location of the
incision, and reducing the probability of
postoperative dry eye. Routine preoperative
Keratograph 4 assessment of patients with
cataracts may ultimately enhance visual
quality.
