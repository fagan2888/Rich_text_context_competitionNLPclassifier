Online courses are a revolutionary trend of educational tech-
nology today. With the rapid rise in online course enrollment
comes a growing concern for low retention rates in many
online courses and programs. Heyman (2010) points out that
one of the biggest concerns in online education emanates
from the excessively high attrition rates in fully online pro-
grams compared with traditional classes. Online courses
have a 10% to 20% higher failed retention rate than tradi-
tional classroom environments (Herbert, 2006). Totally, 40%
to 80% online students drop out of online classes (B. Smith,
2010). Review of existing literature indicates that online
courses have several social, technological, and motivational
issues existing from both the learners' and the faculty's
perspectives.
The Importance of Studying Retention
Issues in Online Courses
The online delivery system has revolutionized educational
technology and has provided easy access to learning for mul-
titudes of students, including many who were unable to go to
school prior to this revolution. Today, online education is one
of the top industries in the world, providing support, knowl-
edge, and jobs to a large segment of the world's population.
Allen and Seaman (2011) report that more than 6 million stu-
dents were taking at least one online course in the year 2010
and that there is a steady 10% growth in online course enroll-
ments. Online learning is also becoming an integral part of
corporate training. Organizations that utilize this platform
have better chances at business and financial gains, as it pro-
vides a positive impact on workplace motivation. Access to
electronic data and a self-paced learning environment may
increase the interest and value of on-the-job training
(Overton, 2007).
Despite all these benefits, online classes continue to dis-
play serious retention issues, which need to be addressed. A
good place to start this is by examining why online learners
leave, when in their academic careers are they most prone to
leave, and what can be done to eliminate or mitigate these
causes. Literature reviews indicate that the online attrition
pattern is not limited to any specific period or level of gradu-
ation. Students may withdraw from online classes anytime in
the semester and at any level of their learning process.
Several studies have been conducted specifically to observe
when and why students withdraw from graduate programs.
The study conducted by Perry, Boman, Care, Edwards, and
Park (2008) indicated that out of a group of 113 students who
had withdrawn from the graduate program, 17 had been
accepted, but they did not begin any class work prior to with-
drawing. The balance consisted of students who had been
registered and had started attending their classes, and yet
decided to drop the program. These students stayed in the

Retention in Online Courses: Exploring
Issues and Solutions--A Literature Review
Papia Bawa1
Abstract
Despite increasing enrollment percentages from earlier years, online courses continue to show receding student retention
rates. To reduce attrition and ensure continual growth in online courses, it is important to continue to review current and
updated literature to understand the changing behaviors of online learners and faculty in the 21st century and examine how
they fit together as a cohesive educational unit. This article reviews literature to ascertain critical reasons for high attrition
rates in online classes, as well as explore solutions to boost retention rates. This will help create a starting point and
foundation for a more, in-depth research and analysis of retention issues in online courses. Examining these issues is critical
to contemporary learning environments.

program anywhere between 2 months and 2 years. Willging
and Johnson's (2009) study indicated that although students
were less likely to leave after investing in several semesters,
there was no dominant reason for dropping out. Most stu-
dents dropped out of a program due to personal, job-related,
and program-related reasons. Perry et al. (2008) mention the
Canadian Association of Graduate Schools Report of 2004,
which indicates that withdrawals from programs may occur
even after several semesters.
Jaggars (2011) refers to several research reviews indicat-
ing that the mid-semester withdrawal rates for online courses
may be higher than face-to-face courses. Levy's (2007) study
indicates that students at a lower learning level at college are
at a higher risk of dropping out than upper level students.
Students who are less experienced and at an earlier semester
of their program are more likely to drop the program. Levy
indicated that students who are in the early stages of their
program feel less prepared to deal with the academic rigors.
On the contrary, students who have spent longer time in the
program may be more motivated to complete the course,
because they have already invested considerable time and
efforts on it. The input in time and effort is a critical determi-
nant as to when a student is more likely to withdraw.
The fact that students are liable to withdraw at any given
stage makes it even more crucial to explore ways and means
to mitigate the underlining causes of this phenomenon.
Stanford-Bowers (2008) points out that a fall in online attri-
tion rates will benefit students, faculty, and institutions. They
believe that this can be accomplished if all those who have a
vested interest in online learning recognize the significance
of this new trend in the educational industry and examine
every aspect of this revolutionary learning medium (Stanford-
Bowers, 2008).
Theoretical Backgrounds for Examining
Online Learners
A synthesis of literature information pertaining to retention
issues and solutions for online environments must begin with
a discussion of the theoretical concepts that determine the
contexts within which online learning environments and
learners are placed. There are several sociological theories,
which explain learner behaviors in an online context. These,
in turn, can become predictors and precursors of issues and
solutions pertaining to online environments. Theories of
marginalization or social exclusion have been used in litera-
ture to explain decisions of learners to select or reject the
online platform. Ball, Davies, David, and Reay (2002) dis-
cuss how "the perceptions and choices of prospective HE
(higher education) students are constructed within a complex
interplay of social factors that are underpinned by basic
social class and ethnic differences" (p. 53). Based on their
study, Ball et al. determined that learners used cognitive and
social criteria to determine their choices.
For the social criteria, the determining factors are the
learners' perceptions of social classification of self and insti-
tutions. Many times, learners gravitate toward online envi-
ronments as it provides them with the perceived benefits of
"virtual" anonymity and protection from being at the receiv-
ing end of discriminatory behavior. However, in the context
of marginalization issues, although online environments can
provide some protection, under certain circumstances, this
environment can become the issue. D. Smith and Ayers
(2006) discuss such implications through the lens of com-
munity colleges. Their examination points to the critical
issue of the prevalence of Westernized curriculum within the
United States that places marginalized learners in a situation
where "the pro-Western bias inherent in the technological
foundations of distance learning presents an obstacle both to
access and to understanding" (D. Smith & Ayers, 2006,
p. 402). Nuances of cross-cultural communication, coupled
with technological impediments, can create untenable learning
environments, leading to attrition. " . . . when discourses are
intricately nuanced with specific cultural meanings, such mean-
ingsmaybe`lostintranslation'astheyareconvertedtoWestern-
dominated electronic media" (D. Smith & Ayers, 2006, p. 406).
Thus, although technology can be considered neutral, there is
always the danger of its hegemonic contamination.
Motivational theories of self-determination and self-
efficacy are also pertinent to examining learners within
online environments. Self-determination is defined as action
generated by one's own mind or free will, with no influence
from outside situations or entities (Wehmeyer, Abery,
Mitaug, & Stancliff, 2003). Chen and Jang (2010) discuss
how in the context of online learners, self-determination the-
ory prescribes three needs, namely, a sense of control, feel-
ings of competency for tasks, and sense of inclusion or
affiliation with others. Just as the satisfaction of these needs
fosters better performance, the absence may actually produce
highly negative results. While examining a model of online
learner motivation based on Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-
determination theory, Chen and Jang demonstrated the direct
correlation between contextual support by teachers, need sat-
isfaction of students, motivation, and performance. They con-
cluded that online learners have different reasons to participate
in class, including their perceptions of how the three needs of
self-determination are met or unmet. Learners belonging to
marginalized groups will need special consideration if these
needs are to be satisfied, which means teachers need to be
cognizant of the student backgrounds and design their contex-
tual support strategies accordingly. In fact, the study sug-
gested, "haphazard and aimless supports without addressing
students'needs are likely to lead to adverse--even worse than
`no effects'--outcomes" (Chen & Jang, 2010, p. 750).
Unfortunately, the online environments may include cul-
turally unaware faculty who are rapidly being thrown into a
situation that they were not historically prepared to face.
Although the globalization of education is a relatively new
Bawa 3
trend, it has escalated exponentially within this decade. This
has given birth to a situation wherein many faculty and
instructors have had little to no time to increase their own
cultural awareness, at least not to the extent required by the
cultural rigors of this evolving situation. Due to education
globalization, this issue is becoming increasingly pro-
nounced, as more and more foreign students seek to enroll
themselves in courses offered by the United States and
Europe, attracted by the perceived value that credits and
degrees from such courses/institutions may provide for them.
In the majority of the cases, such learners enroll in courses
led by faculty who may have little to no exposure to the inter-
national community (Stewart, 2012). Despite having the best
intentions, the lack of cross-cultural interaction also creates a
lack of empathy for one another on part of both students and
faculty alike (Gelb, 2012; Ruggs & Hebl, 2012). Thus, posi-
tive or negative self-determination situations nestled within
online environments will affect the retention of online
learners.
Proponents of socio-cognitive views and models
(Bandura, 1986; Zimmerman & Schunk, 1989) describe how
self-efficacy beliefs of learners determine their abilities to
persist and self-regulate. Shea and Bidjerano (2010) studied
the Community of Inquiry model as proposed by Garrison,
Anderson, and Archer (2000), and concluded that human,
face to face, interaction may have a more positive effect on
learners' self-efficacy beliefs. They indicated that "This
result provides support for the assumption that the absence of
traditional and familiar classroom conventions may result in
additional uncertainty for fully online students" (p. 1727) and
sought to argue in favor of the need "to pay more attention to
supporting the relationship between teaching presence and
self-efficacy in fully online environments" (p. 1727). Thus,
they supported blended environments as opposed to fully
online ones. The fact remains that not all online programs
can afford to provide "live" student­teacher interaction,
which means that the underpinning issues of learner demoti-
vation remain at large in fully online environments.
Constructivism and andragogy are closely related con-
cepts and a huge factor in determining the content, structure,
and climate of online learning environments. Chu and Tsai
(2009) studied the factors that influence adult learners to
select online programs/courses. They concluded that even
though adult learners have concerns about their Internet effi-
cacies, they find the constructivist approach of self-directed
learning prevalent in online environments very attractive.
However, this preference may not be enough to sustain such
learners within the online environments, given their lower
educational technology and Internet usage skills. Most of
these learners belong to the "digital immigrant" group
(Prensky, 2001), and although they could be technology users
for personal things, they may not be equally well informed
when it comes to using educational technology. Thus, online
educators and course designers have a greater responsibility
to give enough time to adult learners to practice online
activities to increase confidence, design content that the
learners can connect to their everyday lives, and provide
resources to allow the learners to construct their own knowl-
edge of pedagogy and technology (Chu & Tasi, 2009). In the
absence of such comprehensive teaching and designing
approaches, it is very likely that adult learners may not pre-
vail within an online environment.
Cognitivism and related theories are critical to under-
standing online education, particularly when viewed through
the lens of globalized content creation and management, as is
required in many online learning programs that have interna-
tional students. Silva, Costa, Rogerson, and Prior (2009)
conducted a meta-analysis of different learning theories to
define knowledge and content with respect to different peda-
gogical approaches. When defining the boundaries of knowl-
edge with relationship to online learning environments, they
state that cognitive appropriation is key to justifiable knowl-
edge. Budin (2008) discussed the significance of content as
being culture-bound, meaning that the users of content may
come from widely diverse populations. Hence, the process of
content management must include a justifiable consideration
for cultural factors with respect to content design.
Siemens's (2014) theory of "Connectivism" provides a
new spin on traditional learning theories, by addressing the
technological and digital aspects of learning. Traditional
theories rely on the belief that learning takes place within
people and that it is a social process. Siemens argues that
learning also occurs outside of people, within the realms of
technology and organizations as individual entities. His
belief is that given the importance of technology in the learn-
ing environs, the focus of discussion and analysis must shift
from the actual process of learning to understanding the
value that any learning can bring. Siemens defines learning
as "actionable knowledge" (p. 5) that can exist outside the
realm of human cognition, within organizations and data-
bases. Being able to make connections within and between
specialized information that enables us to learn more "are
more important than our current state of knowing" (p. 5). In
this context, Connectivism is "The ability to draw distinc-
tions between important and unimportant information . . .
The ability to recognize when new information alters the
landscape based on decisions made yesterday" (p. 5). This
line of thought highlights new paradigms and possibly new
challenges, which must be taken into cognizance when ana-
lyzing online environments.
Examining High Attrition Rates in
Online Environments
Misconceptions Relating to Cognitive Load
Online learning may sometimes be a completely new plat-
form for learners, but learners still choose it using several dif-
ferent criteria and assumptions. Common assumptions related
to online learning are that because face-to-face presence is
4 SAGE Open
not required, an online platform will be less demanding on
time, will require less effort to manage workload, and will
not disrupt the learners' lifestyle. Schaarsmith (2012) indi-
cates that some of the reasons students have for joining
online courses is related to financial factors, such as saving
money on transportation, and the ability to continue working
while pursuing a degree. Shay and Rees's (2004) research
data indicate something similar. When asked about the most
important reasons for choosing online classes, students indi-
cated that they chose online courses based on considerations
such as convenience, flexibility, opportunity to fuse their
current lifestyles to their desire to study, availability of pro-
grams, and affordability (Shay & Rees, 2004).
Although most of these reasons could be valid and viable,
they are also indicative that learners do not consider the mag-
nitude of workload and the required depth of their involve-
ment in the online courses as reasonable criteria to make the
decision to go online. As a result, when they attend the online
classes, many of them are unpleasantly surprised to find that
the conveniences of flexible hours and lower cost outweigh
the inconveniences of excessive demands on lifestyles, tech-
nical issues, and concerns related to the attitude and aptitude
of learners toward a new platform. Online learning environ-
ment is very largely self-driven and dependent on the learn-
ers' ability to manage academic responsibilities, with fewer
props than those available in face-to-face classes. If learners
have not experienced this kind of self-imposed academic dis-
cipline before, they are very likely to experience demotiva-
tion, forcing them to quit. Another factor in this equation is
that many online classes follow constructivist models of
teaching, wherein learners are given props and aids to learn,
but are left to solve complex problems on their own. If learn-
ers are not comfortable with self-learning and constructing
knowledge out of their own initiatives, the online environ-
ment can become intimidating for them.
Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich, andAnderson (1988) researched
the issues and impediments related to "advanced knowledge
acquisition in ill-structured domains" (p. 2). While discussing
their cognitive flexibility theory, they refer to the need for the
learner to "attain a deeper understanding of content material,
reason with it, and apply it flexibly in diverse contexts" (p. 2).
Driscoll (2005) takes cue from this concept when she dis-
cusses how "errors of oversimplification, overgeneralization,
and overreliance on context-independent representations" can
occur when learners attempt to understand "ill-structured
domains," by applying the same information they had used to
understand "well-structured domains" (p. 398). When learn-
ers use their experiences from the well-structured domains of
face-to-face courses as benchmarks for online classes, they
may perceive the online environment as ill structured. A
review of literature indicates that these misconceptions
related to the cognitive loads or overloads may significantly
contribute to higher attrition rates. Paas, Renkl, and Sweller
(2004) refer to the concept of cognitive load as a situation where
learners are intimidated by a large amount of information that
needs to be processed all at once before real learning can
begin. Their study discusses the importance of "managing
working memory load in order to facilitate the changes in
long-term memory associated with schema construction and
automation" (Paas et al., 2004, p. 2).
When learners are not familiar with the online educational
delivery system, they are more apt to be frustrated with the
disparities existing between the long-term memories of their
face-to-face course associations and the new realities of
online learning that they are forced to face. McQuaid (2009)
analyzed the effects of cognitive load on online learners and
discussed how important it is for learners to adapt to the
online learning environment for meaningful learning to take
place, as well as the critical need for instructional designers
to adapt to the learners' assumptions about their ability to
complete a course.
Another thing to consider is the fact that online courses
allow for less student­teacher interaction, as opposed to
face-to-face. Even though multiple communication options
are available in online setups, they may not be used as exten-
sively as they should be, simply because the usage is largely
dependent on the learners' own initiatives. Consequently,
online learners tend to communicate with their instructors
more to get help with a problem and less to take actual guid-
ance to facilitate their learning. As a result, the online envi-
ronment can become less guidance-oriented, which in turn
may be non-conducive to retention. Kirschner, Sweller, and
Clark (2006) indicate that
the free exploration of a highly complex environment may
generate a heavy working memory load that is detrimental to
learning. This suggestion is particularly important in the case of
novice learners, who lack proper schemas to integrate the new
information with their prior knowledge. (p. 80)
Ongoing research also lends support to the fact that cognitive
load may be closely related to student satisfaction with online
courses. Bradford's (2011) research using his Factor
Correlation Matrix and the Principal Components Analysis
indicates that there are significant connections between cog-
nitive load and satisfaction and that "approximately 25% of
the variance in student satisfaction with learning online can
be explained by cognitive load" (p. 217).
Social and Family Factors
The reasons for high attrition rates in online classes could be
a combination of social factors, as well as the attitude, apti-
tude, and motivational threshold of the students. Family
commitment and social obligations of the student could be
contributing factors in low retention. Evans (2009) discusses
how students indicate obligations to their families as a pri-
mary and recurring reason for why they drop an online
course. Other key studies in this field, for example, the works
of Tinto and Summers, indicate the involvement of social
Bawa 5
factors in retention, and although these authors discussed
retention in traditional classrooms, some of the things they
propounded may hold true for e-learning as well. For exam-
ple, Summers (2003) discussed the retention issues in rela-
tion to community college students and observed that
students who had value orientations that were different from
the norm were not able to interact socially with their peers.
As a result, such students felt incompatible with the institu-
tion's social system and were more likely to drop out. Tinto
(2006-2007) emphasized the need to understand the role
family and society plays so that it helps institutions to create
better and more effective support programs for students with
diverse situations and backgrounds.
A turning point in the retention research came with Alfred
Rovai's (2003) discussion of the Composite Persistence
model, which was designed to gauge factors affecting reten-
tion for online students. This model discusses several factors
affecting retention, both prior to admission and after, and
includes social integration and family responsibilities as
applicable factors in the retention equation.
Motivational Factors
Motivational aspects can also cause high attrition rates in
online classes. Because online courses are heavily self-
directed and self-learned, motivation or lack thereof can be a
deciding factor in attrition. Erin Heyman (2010) indicates
that motivation and accountability are closely related to stu-
dent retention in online programs. Motivation in online
courses can be directly linked to the overall course design, as
well as the students' own aptitude and attitude toward learn-
ing and technology. Studies reveal that several factors such as
the time needed to complete modules, lack of real world
issues and contexts in course materials, and problems with
accessibility and availability of resources and support sys-
tems create motivational constraints (Smart & Cappell, 2006).
Technological Constraints and the Digital Natives
Prensky (2001) refers to the term "digital natives" to describe
learners who may be familiar with popular technology but
are not conformable with educational technology. Several
studies support this idea and indicate that student satisfaction
related to the overall course design is a key concern and
determinant in student retention. Weber and Farmer (2012)
indicate that students consider satisfaction regarding course
delivery as a major cause of continuing or withdrawing in
online classes. Another issue relates to the technical exper-
tise of the students in relation to the course design. Although
this generation of students may have technical knowledge
relating to social media and digital entertainment options
such as video games, these skills may not be enough to be
successful in an online course. A key flaw when assessing
student compatibilities with technology is crediting them
with more capabilities than they actually possess in relation
to the online course materials. Overestimating the technol-
ogy readiness of online students is a mistake (Clark-Ibanez
& Scott, 2008). Prensky's research leading to the coining of
the phrase "digital natives" to describe learners who live a
highly digitized life, surrounded by technology, is critical to
understanding the important role this factor plays in e-learn-
ing attrition. A key reason for high attrition rates in online
courses is related to ineffective course designs that are cre-
ated based on assumptions about the online learner, which
may or may not be true. One such assumption is that if a
student is "tech savvy" and is familiar with mobile and/or
social media technology, he or she is a perfect fit for online
learning. Ng's (2012) study reveals key aspects of this issue
and discusses it from a solution point of view, rather than just
articulating the problem. Ng contends that the digital natives,
who can also be the online learners, prefer to be online for
everything including accessing information, getting enter-
tainment, and socializing. They prefer quick delivery and
exchange of information, like to multi-task, and respond bet-
ter to graphics instead of text. The article examines the argu-
ment that although such learners can use technology, they do
not possess skills required to use them for learning. In
essence, a large segment of today's online learners know
how to use technology and are familiar with the digital envi-
ronment; however, it does not necessarily mean that they are
equally conversant with educational technology and e-learn-
ing environments as envisioned by institutions that offer
online courses and programs. The article describes educa-
tional technology as the use of materials and processes to
facilitate teaching and learning. Such educational technolo-
gies could be related to formal and/or informal learning, for
example, an online course or self-learning by surfing the
Internet. Although almost all participants in the study were
familiar and comfortable with sites such as Facebook and
YouTube, they were far less conversant with the usage of
teaching/learning technologies such as wikis, blogs, Google
Docs, Movie Maker, and Photoshop, to name a few. Almost
none of them was familiar with widely used educational
technologies such as Prezi or VoiceThread. They were also
unfamiliar with concepts of ePortfolio or cloud computing
(Ng, 2012). Therefore, it is quite possible that students of
online classes often experience computer-related issues,
especially at the beginning of the semester, and probably
during the course of the semester, if they choose to continue
in the class. This causes many of them to drop the course
well before they get the opportunity to become comfortable
in the courses' cyber zones and also after they have made it
several weeks into the semester.
Lack of Instructor Understanding of Online
Learners
It is not only the learners but also the instructors and course
designers who face similar challenges relating to interaction
in online classes. Many times, the individual perceptions of
6 SAGE Open
the students and the teachers are dramatically different,
resulting in overall poorly designed courses that are confus-
ing and dissatisfying for the learners. To do a good job of
designing online courses, instructional designers need to
understand how an online learner perceives things. Available
literature suggests that online instructors find it increasingly
challenging to maintain a cohesive learning atmosphere in
the class compared with face-to-face classes. Muirhead
(2004) points out that online instructors feel challenged to
create collaborative learning atmospheres that generate true
and meaningful learning. Many times, this difference in per-
ception results in a certain amount of apathy on the instruc-
tors' part to recognize student emotions and feelings.
Tallent-Runnels et al. (2006) indicate that research results
point to the need to create more student-compliant courses.
For example, instructors should be more cognizant of the
psychological aspects of student reactions as revealed in the
student responses to discussions. Knowing why students
react the way they do can provide an insight into modulating
discussions and other collaborative avenues to make courses
more flexible and learner friendly.
Faculty Limitations of Using Technology: The
Digital Immigrant Issues
Prensky (2001) refers to the term "digital immigrants" to
describe instructors who are unable to keep up or understand
the language of the digital native community, stating that
"our Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated
language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach
a population that speaks an entirely new language" (p. 2). Ng
(2012) makes similar assertions when she points out that
educators are responsible for raising awareness of educa-
tional technologies in digital natives, so that they can be used
to facilitate the digital natives'formal learning. This is exem-
plified by comparing how children need to be introduced and
taught to speak languages or use appliances to facilitate their
informal learning. She further contends that digital natives
are less likely to self-explore or look to use educational tech-
nology, unless they are formally introduced to them.
Based on the results of her study, Ng (2012) inferred the
need for educators to be aware of the benefits and possibili-
ties that various technological tools provide for teachers'
training and students' learning. Digital natives, although
familiar with technology and Internet, may have severe limi-
tations in understanding how technology could support their
learning. Therefore, they need constant guidance from their
teachers until they become familiar with the educational tech-
nologies (Ng, 2012). However, this need for the technical
"savviness" of educators is not being met, because the instruc-
tors who are teaching online courses are not technically liter-
ate to the extent required. Prensky (2001) also points out those
digital immigrant instructors have incorrect assumptions that
today's online learners are no different from what learners
have been in the past, and that the teaching methods that were
successful yesterday will be effective today. As a result, there
is a marked dissatisfaction among online learners regarding
the lack of technical knowledge of their instructors. The new
generation of e-learners is "networked most or all of their
lives" and possesses "little patience for lectures, step-by-step
logic, and `tell-test'instruction. Unfortunately, for our Digital
Immigrant teachers, the people sitting in their classes grew
up on the `twitch speed'of video games and MTV" (Prensky,
2001, p. 3).
The key contributing factor for this is the paucity of tech-
nical resources and expertise available to online faculty and
course designers. Liu, Gibby, Quiros, and Demps (2002)
highlight the challenges faculty face when trying to keep
pace with the ever emerging and rapidly evolving technolo-
gies that are necessary to create effective online course
designs. They point out that although instructional design
courses make students well conversant with the theoretical
aspects of the subject, they do not provide the expertise and
knowledge required for practical applications of technolo-
gies. Another key factor leading to ineffective online course
designs is the level of confidence and comfort that the fac-
ulty have with respect to online classes and using technology
in the classroom. The results of a case study by Osika,
Johnson, and Buteau (2009) show that this could be due to a
combination of factors such as the faculty's belief that online
courses are not equal to face to face with respect to learning
quality. Many faculty do not subscribe to the concept of
online course delivery as a full-time medium of instruction.
A large number of faculty from the study group expressed
concern over the lack of support they receive from the insti-
tution, indicating that this was a major factor that made
online courses unattractive to faculty. Young (2004) refers to
a national survey released in 2004 by the Educause Center
forApplied Research that reveals that students were very dis-
satisfied with the way instructors used, or did not use, tech-
nology. Young reports that students complained that
sometimes professors perform poorly, because of technol-
ogy, indicating that such professors are better off when they
use the chalkboard.
Institution Limitations to Training Faculty
One of the prime reasons for lack of good faculty input in
online courses is the lack of drive of educational institutions
to create good training programs for their faculty. The
emphasis is more on developing and deploying online
courses rapidly to increase enrollment, rather than create a
body of well-trained faculty to boost retention. Young (2004)
points out that although colleges spend top dollars for adding
technological components in classrooms, far fewer resources
are devoted to train professors to use these technologies.
Another key reason that institutions and organizations should
spend more time, money, and effort on training faculty is the
changing expectations for online courses and course designs
that involve the use of many different media and technologies
Bawa 7
to deliver course content. In their report, Liu et al. (2002)
compare the process of instructional designing today with a
movie production or conducting a symphony. The authors
discuss how instructional designers like to use different
media to create a harmonious blend of technology and learn-
ing to incite the attention of the students, just as movie direc-
tors or symphony conductors do when they try to attract their
patrons and viewers (Liu et al., 2002). The modern trends in
the changing attitudes and aptitudes in education technology
create a need for better trained faculty. As the existing litera-
ture review indicates, several factors relating to online course
design can cause high attrition rates in online classes.
Keeping these factors in mind while designing online courses
may help regain and retain students.
Some Solutions to Improve the Online
Course Experience
Make Orientation Programs Mandatory
One of the biggest deterrents to online retention is the over-
estimation of student capabilities with respect to the demands
of time, commitment, and technological skills required in
online learning. One way to deal with this is through orienta-
tion programs that introduce students to the rigors and unique
demands of the online classes. However, that in itself can be
a challenge. Studies conducted by Bozarth, Chapman, and
LaMonica (2004) reveal the need for designers and facilita-
tors to understand that students' own perceptions or miscon-
ceptions of their technological skills becomes the biggest
challenge as it makes students feel that an online orientation
program is not required. As a result, many students show
resistance to what they perceive as unnecessary intervention
to their course penetration. Instead of feeling frustrated with
this attitude, instructors and institutions must think about
strategies that will enforce orientation, rather than make it
obligatory. Instructors should also evaluate their own techno-
logical, communication, and facilitation skills and attempt to
update them if necessary.
Using "Live" Interaction and Transparency in
Computer Mediated Communication (CMC)
As indicated by the literature reviews above, social factors
play a significant part in determining student retention. There
is already a preexisting prejudice against online courses
relating to the level of interaction between students and
teachers. According to Roblyer and Ekhaml (2000), several
studies indicate that students and faculty alike have huge
doubts regarding the depth of interaction possible in an
online environment. This creates a serious discomfort in the
minds of learners and educators when it comes to embracing
online delivery systems. Literature reviews also support that
enhancing the social culture of an online class goes a long
way in allowing students to continue with their e-learning
and complete their education.
Dow (2008) provides insight as to how designing online
courses to foster effective dialogue, ease of the use of media
tools, well-structured interactions, and transparency of CMC
helped create a better learning environment. Dow's study
reveals that not having a "live" component in the interactions
was very detrimental to the online learning atmosphere. He
lists several areas of concern in this regard such as the absence
of live conversations, not having any visible identifiers such
as photos of teachers and peers, and a general frustration
about the time gaps between communications. Students feel
uncomfortable when they are unable to see the people they
are conversing with, which in turn hinders how they may
gauge the feelings of their peers online. Consequently, online
courses should be designed to foster more social interaction
between peers and students-teachers.
Creating Classes Structured for Collaborative
Learning
In the study conducted by Dow (2008), participants indicated
how difficult it was to gauge social presence of their peers
and instructors, in the absence of any cohesive working
structure and continued interactions. Another research con-
ducted by Moallem (2003) studied the impact of applying an
interactive design model for creating an online course that
was more structured for collaborative activities, and conse-
quently more amenable to online learning. When applying
this model, emphasis was placed on collaborative problem-
solving tasks, individual accountability, encouraging com-
mitment to group and its goals, facilitating communication
between group members, and providing stability so that
group members could work productively together for longer
period. The results of Moallem's study indicated that having
cohesive and structured tasks, as well as an intuitive design
model, might influence positive interactivity and interaction
among students in an online course. Muirhead (2004) recom-
mends that instructors develop strategies that will enhance
their guidance for the students, such as creating a timeline for
feedback and having a specific feedback rubric. This may
mitigate the struggle instructors face when trying to establish
a meaningful presence in their online classes. This may also
facilitate the instructors' own discovery and experimenta-
tions to develop strategies for a seamless collaboration with
and between the students.
Enhancing Faculty Training and Support
Literature supports the importance faculty training has in
online course design and overall retention. Kate (2009) dis-
cusses the need to focus more on re-training professors who
are taking a huge leap when shifting from face to face to an
online environment. Simply having `good teaching' as part of
an institution's mission is not enough, unless it is comple-
mented by having support infrastructures for the faculty. Only
then can an institution be able to provide effectuve online
course delivery. Even when an institution claims excellence in
8 SAGE Open
teaching as its core value, it does not necessarily mean that
the institution has appropriate support structures for the
teachers. Kate also highlights the importance of including
discussions about training faculty whenever institutions dis-
cuss educational excellence and quality. Levine and Sun
(2002) highlight the connection between effective course
design and faculty training when they discuss how faculty
training and course deigning are connected, and how these in
turn are critical to students. They show concern over the fact
that many times faculty do not receive formal training, which
they believe is required to create good learning environments
in their online classes.
The literature reveals instances of unique and successful
solutions to faculty training and support. One such success
story is that of University of Illinois where administrators
gave faculty a full semester off before teaching online
classes, so that faculty could use that time to train and pre-
pare for a smoother transition from face to face to an online
environment (Kate, 2009). Another example is that of San
Jose State University, where a grant received was used to
create a 2-week program that successfully trained instructors
using one on one training by professional instructional
designers (Kate, 2009). As supported by research, it is pos-
sible that faculty will perform better as far as online course
design modification and teaching are concerned if some form
of training takes place before a faculty teaches an online
course for the first time. In a quantitative study, Julie Ray
(2009) concluded that training instructors prior to their start-
ing to teach online courses resulted in better preparation for
the classes. Similarly, Ray refers to a study of pharmacy
instructors that showed how only 3 hr of training resulted in
a significant increase in instructors' perceived ability to
instruct online. Ray concluded that no matter what and how
the training is imparted, it always has a positive influence on
the instructor's ability to teach online.
Synthesis of Literature Used
The article provided a synthesis of literature to analyze
online learning environments and learners with the intention
of highlighting retention issues and recommending solu-
tions. The high attrition rate in online courses is a cause for
concern (Herbert, 2006; Heyman, 2010; B. Smith, 2010).
This phenomenon needs to be studied in light of the growing
demand for online programs in academic and corporate set-
tings, and the fact that a fall in attrition rates will benefit
students, institutions, and businesses (Allen & Seaman,
2011; Overton, 2007; Stanford-Bowers, 2008). Several stud-
ies have been conducted specifically to observe when and
why students withdraw from graduate programs (Jaggars,
2011; Levy, 2007; Perry et al., 2008; Willging & Johnson,
2009). The results of these indicate that students were more
apt to drop out during earlier stages of the semester, and there
are multiple reasons for doing this including personal prefer-
ences, profession-related, and program-related issues.
Learning theories such as social exclusion, self-determina-
tion, self-efficacy, cognitivism, constructivism, and connec-
tivism can provide a deeper insight into the workings of
online learning environments, including leaners, instructors,
and course contents (Bandura, 1986; Budin, 2008; Chen &
Jang, 2010; Chu & Tasi, 2009; Deci & Ryan, 1985; Gelb,
2012; Ruggs & Hebl, 2012; Shea & Bidjerano, 2010;
Siemens, 2014; Silva et al., 2009; D. Smith & Ayers, 2006;
Stewart, 2012; Wehmeyer et al., 2003; Zimmerman &
Schunk, 1989).
Several critical factors lead to high attrition rates in online
environments. One of them is the misconceptions learners
have about the workload, cognitive challenges, and general
expectations. Learners may select online classes for personal
reasons, without recognizing that they may have issues with
their entry-level skills pertaining to the subject or technology
being used in online classes. This could place novice-level
learners, who are used to the structured forms of face-to-face
courses, in the fluid, ill-structured domains of online envi-
ronments, leading to demotivation and attrition (Bradford,
2011; Driscoll, 2005; Kirschner et al., 2006; McQuaid, 2009;
Paas et al., 2004; Schaarsmith, 2012; Shay & Rees, 2004;
Spiro et al., 1988).
Family commitment and social obligations of students
could be contributing factors in low retention. In addition,
students without the norm value orientations may be unable
to interact socially with their peers. As a result, such students
felt incompatible with the institution's social system and
were more likely to drop out (Evans, 2009; Rovai, 2003;
Summers, 2003; Tinto, 2006-2007). The constructivist and
self-oriented nature of online learning can create issues of
motivation, particularly for learners with technological skill
limitations. The assumptions of online course designers and
educators about the technological compatibility of the digital
native learners can lead to issues with course designs. These
factors have been known to accelerate attrition rates (Clark-
Ibanez & Scott, 2008; Heyman, 2010; Ng, 2012; Prensky,
2001; Smart & Cappell, 2006; Weber & Farmer, 2010).
In addition, the profiles, attitudes, and aptitudes of online
faculty could become issues for online learning environ-
ments. Research indicates that a large number of online fac-
ulty have a low level of understanding of the way online
learners learn. Many times, face-to-face faculty are invited to
teach or design online courses, with minimal or zero expo-
sure to the pedagogical aspects of online environments.
Consequently, they may work under the erroneous assump-
tion that what works for on-ground will work equally well
for online. Some of the challenges such faculty face are
developing and sustaining interactive and dynamic collab-
orative climates in their online classes, adjusting their own
gaps in technology skills, and falling prey to their inherent
prejudice against the perceived lack of value of online classes
versus face to face ones. The paucity of training and profes-
sional development opportunities compound the problems
(Liu et al., 2002; Muirhead, 2004; Ng, 2012; Osika et al.,
Bawa 9
2009; Prensky, 2001; Tallent-Runnels et al., 2006; Young,
2004).
Given the magnitude and depth of the issues, researchers
have looked for viable solutions. Rigorous orientation pro-
grams can help online learners become better prepared for
their academic journeys online. Faculty should also evaluate
their own technological, communication and facilitation
skills and attempt to update them as and when needed so that
they can create a more transparent and collaborative online
learning environment within their classes and be effective
guides of technology for their students. Institutions must find
ways to enhance faculty training for online teaching. Using
such simple measures can greatly help contain attrition and
increase retention rates in online classes/programs (Bozarth
et al., 2004; Dow, 2008; Kate, 2009; Levine & Sun, 2002;
Moallem, 2003; Ray, 2009; Roblyer & Ekhaml, 2000).
Implications for Future Research
As a survey and review of literature reveals, the causes of
poor retention in online courses are many, and although there
has been some headway in the area of providing viable solu-
tions to this issue, much deeper and wider studies are required
to develop a better understanding of ways and means to solve
online course issues and improve online classes and course
designs to facilitate and benefit both learners and educators.
The most desired outcome of such research should be to help
boost retention. At present, there are many emerging trends
in the world of e-learning that presents different avenues for
future research such as Rovai's (2003) Composite Persistence
model or Bradford's (2011) concept of Factor Correlation
Matrix and the Principal Components Analysis. However,
models and concepts such as these need to be examined in
the light of more real world context using larger participant
groups. Faculty and institutional involvement, as well as the
importance of creating more interactive and better-designed
online course content in the retention equation, must also be
studied. This article is a small beginning toward a larger and
broader scaled research in this field.
