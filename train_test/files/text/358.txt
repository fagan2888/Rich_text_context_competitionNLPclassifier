Background. Listeria monocytogenes is among the most virulent foodborne pathogens, with 20% of clinical
infections resulting in death. To explore listeriosis-associated mortality in the United States and to evaluate pre-
vention efforts, we reviewed vital records over a 16-year period to assess demographic, temporal, and seasonal
trends.
Methods. Nonperinatal listeriosis-associated deaths from 1990 through 2005 were identified from multiple-
cause­coded death records and were combined with US census data to calculate mortality rates. Poisson regression
was used to model time trends, and logistic regression was used to identify comorbid conditions associated with
listeriosis on the death record.
Results. Of the 37,267,946 deaths occurring in the United States during the 16-year study period, 1178 included
listeriosis on the death record. Listeriosis-related mortality rates decreased annually by 10.74% from 1990 through
1996 and by 4.26% from 1996 through 2005. Seasonal trends show a distinct peak in mortality from July through
October. After adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, listeriosis was positively associated with human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (odds ratio, 4.19; 95% confidence interval, 3.06­5.73), lymphoid and he-
matopoietic cancers (odds ratio, 5.27; 95% confidence interval, 4.47­6.22), and liver disease (odds ratio, 2.05;
95% confidence interval, 1.54­2.73) on the death record.
Conclusions. Nonperinatal listeriosis-associated deaths in the United States have decreased, paralleling a de-
creasing trend in incidence. Strict monitoring of food manufacturing processes, as well as improved treatment for
HIV infection, may have played influential roles in preventing human infections. Health care providers should be
aware of seasonal listeriosis patterns, as well as conditions predisposing individuals to severe infection and death
due to L. monocytogenes infection, to guide strategies for disease management and prevention.
For more than 2 decades, foodborne illness caused by
Listeria monocytogenes has raised significant public
health concern in the United States, Europe, and other
areas of the world. Each year, there are an estimated
2500 cases in the United States, resulting in 2300 hos-
pitalizations and 500 deaths [1]. This pathogen is more
invasive than the pathogens associated with most types
of foodborne illness, and conditions typically associated
with Listeria infection include meningitis, encephalitis,
sepsis, and febrile gastroenteritis [2]. Infections are
most common among elderly individuals, newborns,

pregnant women, and individuals with compromised
immune systems [3].
Several reports have described patterns of listeriosis
incidence in the United States and parts of Europe [4­
7]. Although there is some indication that the number
of Listeria­related infections are increasing in Germany,
England, and Wales (particularly among the elderly
population) [4, 5], data from the Foodborne Diseases
Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) show that the
number of cases in the United States has decreased in
recent years [2, 7]. The number of laboratory-con-
firmed cases in the United States decreased by 24%
from 1996 through 2003, presumably because of im-
proved testing and control of ready-to-eat foods for L.
monocytogenes contamination, as well as other disease
prevention efforts [7].
In spite of the availability of surveillance data on
disease incidence, relatively little is known about lis-
teriosis cases resulting in death. Information on mor-

tality within the population is necessary, not only to more fully
understand the burden of disease, but to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of prevention efforts. Population-based mortality data
have been used to investigate other infectious diseases [8, 9],
but to our knowledge, these data have not yet been used in
listeriosis research. In the present study, we examined vital re-
cords data to assess demographic, temporal, and seasonal trends
in mortality due to listeriosis in the United States from 1990
through 2005.
METHODS
Death records. Multiple-cause-of-death data from US death
certificates have been collected, processed, and made available
for public use by the National Center for Health Statistics for
the years 1990­2005 [10]. These death certificates contain basic
demographic information for each decedent, including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and place of residence (geographic data un-
available for 2005). In addition to designating an underlying
cause, the physician or coroner filling out the death certificate
may list up to 20 conditions that are believed to have contrib-
uted in some way to the death of the individual. Each of these
conditions is coded on the basis of the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases system for the year in which the death oc-
curred (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] for the period 1990­1998 and International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] for the period 1999­
2005).
In our study, cases are defined as US resident deaths having
an ICD-9 code of 027.0 ("Listeriosis, Infection by Listeria mono-
cytogenes, Meningitis by Listeria monocytogenes, Meningoen-
cephalitis by Listeria monocytogenes, Septicaemia by Listeria
monocytogenes; excludes: congenital listeriosis [771.2]") or an
ICD-10 code within the range A32.0-A32.9 (A32 p listeriosis;
A32.0 p cutaneous listeriosis; A32.1 p listerial meningitis and
meningoencephalitis; A32.7 p listerial septicemia; A32.8 p
other forms of listeriosis; A32.9 p listeriosis, unspecified) listed
as the underlying, immediate, contributing, or other cause listed
in the cause of death section of the death record. Perinatal
listeriosis cases (in which death occurred from 16 weeks after
conception through 30 days postpartum) [11] have been ex-
cluded from our study, because the ICD-9 codes referencing
these cases (655.4 and 771.2) encompass multiple congenital
conditions that cannot be separated for analysis.
Mortality rates and trends. Mortality rates were calculated
using bridged-race population estimates derived from US cen-
sus data [12, 13] and were subsequently age-adjusted with
weights from the 2000 US standard population data [14].
Bridged-race estimates of the population are necessary to con-
trol for changes in racial categorization across census years. To
facilitate a review of temporal trends, we calculated age-adjusted
mortality rates, cross-tabulated these by year, and then esti-
mated corresponding temporal patterns using Poisson regres-
sion models. Mortality rates for race/ethnicity, sex, and geo-
graphic region were calculated with aggregated data from all
years of our study to ensure stable rates (1990­2004 for geo-
graphic data). Race/ethnicity was divided into 5 categories: non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific
Islander, and Native American. For our geographic analysis, we
divided the 50 states into 4 major regions and 9 subregions
according to US census divisions [15].
Comorbidity analysis. Multiple-cause­coded mortality
data facilitate a review of many factors influencing the death
of an individual. To identify these factors, we searched liste-
riosis-related deaths for comorbidities frequently noted on the
death certificate and compared these with data from a control
group comprising all non­listeriosis-associated deaths. Statis-
tical associations were estimated by creating unconditional lo-
gistic regression models with listeriosis as the outcome and with
the selected comorbidity as the main exposure variable. We
included age, race/ethnicity, and sex in each model to control
for their potential confounding effects. HIV as a comorbidity
was also tested as a potential confounder in each model. All
calculations were performed with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS).
RESULTS
Demographic and temporal trends. We identified 1178 lis-
teriosis-related deaths during the period 1990­2005, repre-
senting 0.003% of the 37,267,946 total deaths among US res-
idents. The overall crude mortality rate associated with
listeriosis was 0.27 deaths per 1 million persons annually (95%
CI, 0.25­0.28 deaths per 1 million persons annually), and after
adjustment for age, this rate remained unchanged at 0.27 deaths
per 1 million persons annually (95% CI, 0.26­0.29 deaths per
1 million persons annually) (table 1). Although 180% of lis-
teriosis-related deaths occurred among non-Hispanic whites,
race-specific mortality rates, adjusted for age, were similar for
non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and
non-Hispanic whites (range, 0.27­0.33 deaths per 1 million
persons annually) (table 1). The most common underlying
causes of mortality among listeriosis-related deaths included
listeriosis (838 deaths; 71.1%), cancer (130 deaths; 11.0%), and
diseases of the heart (59 deaths; 5.0%).
Figure 1 highlights the overall temporal trends in listeriosis-
associated mortality from 1990 through 2005. According to a
Poisson regression analysis, the data show a yearly decrease in
age-adjusted mortality of 10.74% (95% CI, 7.22%­14.13%)
from 1990 through 1996, followed by a decrease of 4.26% (95%
CI, 1.51%­6.94%) from 1996 through 2005. Overall incidence
decreased from 127 deaths in 1990 (age-adjusted mortality rate,
0.53 deaths per 1 million persons) to 55 deaths in 2005 (age-
adjusted mortality rate, 0.18 deaths per 1 million persons). A

the period from July through October) was observed, with the
largest number of deaths occurring in September (148 deaths;
12.6%) and the fewest deaths occurring in February (68 deaths;
5.8%) (figure 2).
The mean age at death was 67.9 years (median age, 71 years;
range, !1­102 years), and individuals 65 years of age ac-
counted for nearly 70% of deaths (table 1). Individuals 85
years of age had the highest mortality rate of any age group
(2.12 deaths per 1 million persons annually). Male individuals
accounted for slightly more deaths than did female individuals
and had higher age-adjusted mortality rates (0.34 deaths per 1
million persons annually vs. 0.23 deaths per 1 million persons
annually). During the study period, however, we observed a
converging trend between the sexes (figure 1). From 1990
through 1996, mortality rates among the male population de-
creased by a mean of 10.45% per year (95% CI, 5.65%­15.01%
per year), whereas rates among the female population decreased
by 11.23% per year (95% CI, 5.96%­16.19% per year). During
the period 1996­2005, mortality rates among the male popu-
lation decreased by a mean of 4.98% per year (95% CI, 1.06%­
8.74% per year), whereas the mortality rate among the female
population decreased by 3.71% per year (95% CI, 7.47% de-
crease per year to 0.21% increase per year).
Geographic statistics. Listeria-related mortality varied to
some degree across the 4 major geographic regions and 9 sub-
regions of the United States. From 1990 through 2004, of the
4 geographic regions, the lowest mortality was found in the
Midwest, which had a rate of 0.23 deaths per 1 million persons
annually, whereas the West region had the highest rate (0.33
deaths per 1 million persons annually) (table 2). In the Pacific
subregion (i.e., California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and
Hawaii), there were 205 deaths, representing 18.3% of Listeria-
related deaths and yielding a mortality rate of 0.36 deaths per
1 million persons annually. By contrast, there were 49 deaths
related to listeriosis in the West North Central subregion (i.e.,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kan-
sas, and Missouri), representing 4.4% of listeriosis-related
deaths and an annual mortality rate of 0.17 deaths per 1 million
persons.
Disease associations. The frequency of HIV listing as a
comorbidity among listeriosis-related deaths varied to some
degree during the study period. From 1990 through 1995, 29
Listeria-related deaths (4.9%) also had HIV noted on the vital
record, whereas only 20 such deaths (3.4%) were reported dur-
ing the later years of the study. This difference in proportions,
however, was not statistically significant ( ).

Listeriosis was positively associated with a number of infec-
tious and chronic conditions recorded on the death certificate.
After adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, associations
were observed between listeriosis and HIV infection (OR, 4.19;
95% CI, 3.06­5.73), anemia (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.32­2.52),
and liver disease (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.54­2.73) (table 3). Al-
though no statistical association was observed between liste-
riosis and malignant neoplasms of all types (OR, 1.00; 95% CI,
0.88­1.14), lymphoid and hematopoietic cancers were 15 times
as likely (OR, 5.27; 95% CI, 4.47­6.22) to be listed on death
records with listeriosis than to be listed on death records with-
out listeriosis. This association with lymphoid and hemato-
poietic cancers remained relatively unchanged (OR not altered
by 15%) after controlling for the potential confounding effects
of HIV infection, hepatitis, organ transplantation, and lupus.
DISCUSSION
Nonperinatal listeriosis-related deaths decreased over the 16-
year study period, highlighting an encouraging, although not
entirely unexpected, mortality trend. Evidence shows that in-
cidence rates of sporadic listeriosis in the United States similarly
decreased during the years of our study, and there are several
factors that may account for this downward trend [7, 16]. A
zero-tolerance policy, prohibiting the sale of ready-to-eat meats
contaminated with L. monocytogenes, was developed in 1987

by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture [17]. This policy has since been modified
to increase on-site testing of meat and poultry processing plants
[18, 19]. Results of a multistate case-control study published
in 1992 prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention to issue recommendations both to assist health care
providers in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and to
caution individuals who were at high risk against the con-
sumption of certain foods [20]. Prevention efforts by the food
industry included the development of a Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Points strategy to minimize levels of L. monocytogenes
at key points of the cooking and packaging processes prior to
distribution [21].
Changes in host factors likely played a role in further re-
ducing Listeria-related mortality during the mid-1990s. The
first protease inhibitor was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in late 1995 [22], and its use in combination
with other antiretroviral therapy resulted in dramatic decreases
in morbidity and mortality among patients with HIV infection
and/or AIDS [23]. Cases of invasive disease caused by oppor-
tunistic organisms, such as L. monocytogenes, are now less fre-
quent among those infected with HIV because of the consid-
erable immunorestorative effects of this novel treatment [24].
Our data tend to support this trend, because we observed HIV
infection and/or AIDS listed more frequently as a comorbidity
among individuals with listeriosis-associated deaths from 1990
through 1995 (4.9% of cases) than from 1996 through 2005
(3.4%). Among men, who have a higher rate of HIV infection
than women, we also observed a 30% drop in listeriosis-related
mortality from 1995 to 1996 (figure 1).
Relatively little has been published on seasonal listeriosis
patterns in the United States. Although our data show a clear
increase in mortality from July through October, the reasons
for this are unclear. Using data collected from the FoodNet
surveillance system, Voetsch et al. [7] reported that listeriosis
infections are more frequent among individuals 50 years of
age during these same months but that pregnancy-associated
cases, as well as cases among younger individuals, do not nec-
essarily follow this same trend. Given that ready-to-eat meats,
such as sliced deli meats and hot dogs, are common vehicles
of transmission, it is possible that these foods are served more
frequently during the summer months (e.g., at picnics or bar-
becues, where they may be left unrefrigerated for long periods
of time prior to consumption).
Our data also show variation in listeriosis-related mortality
by geographic region, although the reasons for this are not
evident. Pathogen exposure levels may vary by region according
to local dietary preferences and habits. Underlying risk factors
for infection may also be more prevalent in certain regional
populations, leading to higher numbers of Listeria-related
deaths in those areas.
We also observed an increase in Listeria-related deaths with
age (table 1). Although this finding was expected, it has clinical
relevance, because of the overall aging trend of the US popu-

lation. Changes in food industry regulation have led to an
overall decrease in listeriosis-related mortality, but clinicians
should continue to offer dietary recommendations to patients
55 years of age in an effort to further reduce mortality among
this group.
L. monocytogenes has historically caused more reported in-
fections among men than among women [2, 25], although the
gap has narrowed in recent years. Our data show that men and
women experienced similar numbers of deaths, but age-ad-
justed mortality rates for men were 48% higher than for
women, suggesting that men tend to die from listeriosis at
younger ages than women. A retrospective study of Vibrio vul-
nificus infection in Los Angeles County found that men are less
likely than women to follow education measures warning
against the consumption of contaminated foods [26]. Although
dietary habits tend to differ between the sexes, the disparity in
mortality may also be an indication of a larger population of
immunocompromised men than immunocompromised
women living in the United States. For example, in New York
City, Sackoff et al. [27] recently found that men account for
nearly 70% of persons with AIDS who are 13 years of age.
Immunocompromised individuals have long been recog-
nized as a group at high risk for opportunistic infections, such
as listeriosis [7, 25]. T cell­mediated immune responses play
a central role in maintaining the body's defenses against intra-
cellular pathogenic organisms [28]. Cancer, organ transplan-
tation, HIV infection, diabetes, renal disease, and liver disease
have been recognized as specific conditions that predispose the
individual to develop listeriosis [2, 25, 29, 30]. Whether this is
due to the nature of the diseases themselves, the medications
commonly prescribed to treat them, or a combination of the
2 is not clear and may vary by condition. In the case of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, hypogammaglobulinemia results from
the cancer itself, whereas common treatment with purine an-
alogs and monoclonal antibodies leads to T cell immunode-
ficiency, further increasing the risk of developing infection [31].
This malignancy comprises an important segment of the lym-
phoid and hematopoietic cancers, which have a notably strong
association with listeriosis on the death certificate (table 2).
Our data also suggest disease associations that may not be
widely recognized. Connective tissue disease, including systemic
lupus erythematosus, has previously accompanied listeriosis as
either a comorbid or preexisting condition in 2 case series and
1 outbreak [29, 30, 32]. Viral hepatitis and hemolytic anemia
have also been linked to Listeria infection in case studies, al-
though a statistical association had not been established prior
to our study [33­36].
Several important limitations are associated with the use of
multiple-cause-of-death data that require consideration. Al-
though these data are population based and contain large num-
bers of observations, death certificates may contain errors,
which have been attributed to a variety of factors [37]. Redel-
ings et al. [38] point out that, instead of reporting all prevalent
diseases on the death certificate, physicians more commonly
list only those that are believed to play an instrumental role in
the death of the individual. Therefore, the death certificate of
Listeriosis Mortality in the US · CID 2008:47 (1 October) · 873
an individual who dies of a serious infection, such as listeriosis,
may be less likely to list chronic conditions--such as cardio-
vascular disease, stroke, or hypertension--even if these are pre-
sent at the time of death.
A second limitation is the chronological ambiguity of diseases
listed on an individual death record [39]. For instance, although
we note a strong positive association between HIV infection
and listeriosis (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 3.06­5.73), the data do not
explicitly indicate which developed first. They merely indicate
that both conditions were present at the time of death.
Underreporting and misclassification of listeriosis may also
limit our study, because some discrepancy exists between es-
timates of listeriosis-related deaths from prior studies [1, 7]
and the number of cases in which listeriosis was recorded on
the death certificate . Data from FoodNet have been used to
estimate that 500 individuals die each year of listeriosis in the
United States [1], yet actual death records include only 127
nonperinatal Listeria-associated deaths for 1990 and just 55
such deaths for 2005. The exclusion of perinatal Listeria-as-
sociated deaths in our study accounts for some, but likely not
all, of this discrepancy. Although it is unclear which data source
most closely reflects the true disease burden in the population,
the possibility of misclassification error exists in our data. Lis-
teriosis-associated deaths might be recorded on death certifi-
cates as "unspecified septicemia" (ICD-9 code 038.9 or ICD-
10 code A41.9) in the absence of laboratory test results positive
for L. monocytogenes.
Finally, mortality rates may be distorted because of errors in
population estimates, particularly for race/ethnicity. Because
estimates of the at-risk population factor into the denominator
for rate calculations, such errors can lead to biased estimates
of mortality rates.
Because of the limitations of multiple-cause-of-death data
and the potential for error in estimating population size, we
urge caution in interpreting our results. However, when the
direction of incidence trends, the biologic plausibility of as-
sociations identified, and a general agreement with prior lit-
erature are considered, these findings likely reflect true patterns
of listeriosis-associated mortality in the United States. The de-
creasing trend in listeriosis-associated mortality over a 16-year
period demonstrates the largely preventable nature of Listeria
infection, as well as the success of collaborative efforts by the
US Department of Agriculture, US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and food
industry in limiting the spread of this opportunistic pathogen.
Changes in host factors among the population, particularly with
respect to HIV infection status and treatment, have played a
minor (although important) role in influencing listeriosis-as-
sociated mortality.
Despite these recent successes, listeriosis remains a cause of
preventable mortality in the United States. Prevention efforts
in educating high-risk groups, such as the elderly population
and those with decreased immune function, should emphasize
extra caution during the summer and early fall. Health care
providers should be aware of conditions that may predispose
individuals to developing severe infection and death due to L.
monocytogenes and incorporate this knowledge into strategies
for disease management.
