Background: The metabolic syndrome is associated with low-grade
inflammation. It has been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines
and low-grade systemic inflammation activate bone resorption and
may lead to reduced bone mineral density (BMD), but no previous
studies have evaluated the association between the metabolic syn-
drome and BMD. We examined this relationship in a representative
U.S. population-based sample from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994).
Methods: We identified adult subjects enrolled in NHANES III with
the metabolic syndrome as defined by the criteria of the Adult Treat-
ment Panel III. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of femoral
neck BMD (FN-BMD) for subjects with and without the metabolic
syndrome. Analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates and strat-
ified by quintile of body mass index.
Results: Among 8197 persons at least 20 yr old who underwent
FN-BMD measurement, 1773 (22%) had the metabolic syndrome.
After multivariable adjustment, FN-BMD was higher among subjects
with the metabolic syndrome (0.86 g/cm2) than those without (0.80
g/cm2; P  0.0001). When stratified by body mass index, FN-BMD was
similar between subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.
Adjusted FN-BMD increased with additional components of the met-
abolic syndrome (P  0.0001 for trend), and there was a significant
positive association with abdominal obesity (P  0.0001). A subgroup
of subjects with diabetes had higher FM-BMD than those without,
independent of abdominal obesity.
Conclusions: In NHANES III, the metabolic syndrome was not as-
sociated with reduced FN-BMD. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 92:
4161­4164, 2007)
THE METABOLIC SYNDROME is a cluster of conditions
with detrimental effects on cardiovascular health and
a known association with low-grade inflammation (1, 2). The
metabolic syndrome includes obesity, dyslipidemia, im-
paired glucose tolerance, and hypertension (3). The proin-
flammatory state associated with the metabolic syndrome
may lead to a reduction in bone mass (4). However, obesity
or high body mass index (BMI) is known to have a protective
effect against osteoporosis (5). A recent prospective study
demonstrated that the metabolic syndrome reduced risks of
nonvertebral fractures (6).
Osteoporosis is common in various inflammatory condi-
tions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythem-
atosus, and ankylosing spondylitis (7). Proinflammatory cy-
tokines up-regulate receptor activator of nuclear factor-B
ligand, leading to increased bone resorption and osteoporo-
sis (8­10). C-reactive protein (CRP) is a systemic inflamma-
tory marker regulated by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and
TNF-. Some have suggested that an elevated CRP is asso-
ciated with osteoporosis and nontraumatic fracture (4, 11).
The systemic inflammation related to the metabolic syn-
drome might activate bone resorption and lead to reduced
bone mineral density (BMD).
Despite the association between the metabolic syndrome
and obesity, the hypothesized underlying inflammatory
state may lead to reduced BMD. However, no prior studies
have directly evaluated the association with the metabolic
syndrome and osteoporosis. Thus, we performed an analysis
of the relationship between the metabolic syndrome and
BMD in a representative U.S. sample from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,
1988­1994).
Subjects and Methods
Data source and subjects
NHANES III was conducted by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1988
and 1994. The sample represents the civilian, noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation of the United States (12). We identified subjects aged 20 yr and
older with the metabolic syndrome according to the criteria of the Adult
Treatment Panel III using NHANES III (3). Subjects were considered to
have the metabolic syndrome if they had three or more of the following
abnormalities: abdominal obesity (waist circumference  102 cm in men
and  88 cm in women); hypertriglyceridemia  150 mg/dl; low high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol  40 mg/dl; high blood pres-
sure  130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication; or high
fasting glucose  110 mg/dl or use of antidiabetic medication (insulin
or oral agents). Femoral neck BMD (FN-BMD) measured with dual-
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was compared for the cohorts with
and without the metabolic syndrome. Subjects without a DXA mea-
surement were excluded from the analysis.
Covariates
Demographic and medical risk factors predictive of reduced BMD
were considered potential confounders. In addition to gender, age, and
race, other important covariates included: BMI (kilograms per square
meter), smoking (current vs. former or never), alcohol intake (number of
drinks in the previous month), physical activity (metabolic equivalents/

menopause status. Relevant chronic medical conditions included con-
gestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), and nonskin cancer. We also examined serum
levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (nanograms per milliliter), and serum
CRP (milligrams per deciliter) as confounders (13). BMI was not in-
cluded in the analysis because it generally parallels abdominal obesity
for definition of the metabolic syndrome. However, secondary analyses
were stratified by BMI.
We considered use of potentially relevant medications such as oral
glucocorticoids, thiazide diuretics, hormone replacement therapy, 3-hy-
droxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and
-blockers. Users of osteoporosis therapy such as calcitonin, bisphos-
phonate, or selective estrogen receptor modulators were sparse, so we
could not control for these medications. Total calcium intake (milligrams
per day) was calculated by summing the average dietary intake plus the
supplements. Medication use was ascertained by asking, "Have you
taken or used any medicines for which a doctor's or dentist's prescrip-
tion is needed in the past month?" and each medication container was
checked by the interviewer. Participants reported the duration of use for
each medication.
BMD
All analyses considered FN-BMD as the primary outcome and were
cross-sectional comparisons. DXA (QDR 1000; Hologic, Waltham, MA)
was used with appropriate quality control measures (13). The BMDs of
other anatomic sites were not available in NHANES III.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics of subjects with the metabolic syndrome and
controls were compared by Student's t test for continuous variables and
Pearson's 2 test for categorical variables. We used a multivariable linear
regression model to assess the relationship between the metabolic syn-
drome and FN-BMD. The FN-BMD was also examined for each specific
component of the metabolic syndrome and by the number of compo-
nents present. We repeated our analyses using more parsimonious mod-
els, excluding a history of fractures and CRP levels. P  0.05 (two sided)
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Among 17,872 participants 20 yr old or older, we identified
8,197 eligible people who underwent DXA measurement. A
total of 1773 (22%) subjects had the metabolic syndrome and
6424 did not. The baseline characteristics of subjects with and
without the metabolic syndrome were different (Table 1).
Compared with controls, subjects with the metabolic syn-
drome were older; were more female and white; less fre-
quently used tobacco; reported less physical activity, had
worse health; were more frequently menopausal; had lower
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and higher CRP levels; and
were more likely to have congestive heart failure, cerebro-
vascular disease, COPD, and cancer. In addition, those with
the metabolic syndrome more frequently used oral glucocor-
ticoids, thiazides, hormone replacement therapy, statins, and

-blockers (all P  0.01). The distributions of other variables
were similar.
Unadjusted FN-BMD was reduced (P  0.005) among
persons with the metabolic syndrome, but after adjustment
for age and gender and other covariates, it was higher in
subjects with the metabolic syndrome than in controls (P 
0.001). In analyses stratified by BMI, adjusted BMD in sub-
jects with the metabolic syndrome was similar to controls
(Table 2). With the presence of increasing components of the
metabolic syndrome, there was a significant trend toward
higher FN-BMD (P  0.001 for trend) (Table 3). The adjusted
CRP level increased with more components: CRP  0.17
mg/dl for no component, 0.25 mg/dl for one component,
0.35 mg/dl for two components, 0.49 mg/dl for three com-
ponents, 0.53 mg/dl for four components, and 0.27 mg/dl for
five components (P  0.001 for trend). We examined mul-
tivariable linear regression models for each component of the
metabolic syndrome separately and found significantly
higher FN-BMDs in subgroups of people with abdominal
obesity (P  0.001) and diabetes (P  0.001). To better assess
the role of obesity in the relationship between the metabolic
syndrome and FN-BMD, we conducted analyses stratified by
abdominal obesity. The associations between the metabolic
syndrome components and FN-BMD remained the same (Ta-
ble 4).
We performed an analysis stratified on abdominal obesity
examining the potential relationship between low-grade in-
flammation and BMD. Among male subjects with abdominal
obesity present, we found lower BMD for those with CRP 1
or greater (0.80 g/cm2) vs. CRP less than 1 (0.88 g/cm2, P 
0.052). None of the other patient subgroups (men without
abdominal obesity or women) exhibited a similar relation-
ship. When CRP was removed from the primary model, the
adjusted BMD stratified by BMI was unchanged from the
results presented in Table 2.
We examined FN-BMD in light of the relationship between
the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance and found a
trend toward higher BMD as fasting glucose (FG) level in-
creases (P  0.0012 for trend): 0.81 g/cm2 (FG  125 mg/dl);
0.86 g/cm2 (FG 125­199 mg/dl); 0.88 g/cm2 (FG 200­249
mg/dl); 0.83 g/cm2 (FG 250­299 mg/dl); 0.80 g/cm2 (FG
300­349 mg/dl); and 1.02 g/cm2 (FG  350 mg/dl).
Discussion
In this study of a representative the U.S. adult population,
subjects with the metabolic syndrome had an increased FN-
BMD, compared with controls without the metabolic syn-
drome. This association was mainly driven by abdominal
obesity, and stratified analysis by BMI showed similar BMD
between subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.
We also found a higher BMD as the number of the metabolic
syndrome components increased. We observed that higher
BMD in the metabolic syndrome is largely determined by
abdominal obesity. The protective effect of fat mass may be
multifactorial: not only does mechanical loading increase
BMD, but high circulating insulin levels as well as factors that
are cosecreted with insulin (e.g. amylin and preptin arising
from pancreatic -cells) may promote bone formation (15).
Our results are similar to those of previous cross-sectional
studies in that patients with diabetes had higher BMD (16,
17). A recent study reported that the metabolic syndrome
protects against nonvertebral fractures (16). Insulin resis-
tance is a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome, and
prior studies demonstrated that circulating insulin levels
and/or indices of insulin resistance are associated with bone
density (18­20). Although type 1 diabetes may be related to
bone mass reduction (21), longitudinal population-based
study revealed that women with type 2 diabetes had a higher
hip BMD at baseline but rapid bone loss over time (17).

Hyperinsulinemia is associated with bone formation in type
2 diabetes (21). We also observed increased BMD with higher
fasting glucose levels, a marker of insulin resistance. Because
subjects with high insulin resistance showed more inflam-
mation than subjects with a low insulin resistance state (22,
23), elevated inflammation in diabetes may eventually result
in reduced BMD.
A central question raised by this study is whether inflam-
mation associated with the metabolic syndrome offsets the
protective effect of adiposity or diabetes on bone mass. The
metabolic syndrome is a complex set of conditions that in-
cludes obesity, a factor associated with enhanced BMD, and
inflammation, a factor thought to reduce BMD. In the pri-
mary analytic models, we controlled for CRP but removed it
from the parsimonious models. The different sets of models
gave the same results. Whereas previous work suggests that
osteoporosis is linked to inflammation, it is not yet clear
whether higher CRP levels are associated with bone loss (4,
24). In the metabolic syndrome, we found a trend toward
reduced BMD with higher CRP levels in obese men, but there
was no association between inflammation and BMD in other
subjects. The low-grade inflammation in the metabolic syn-
drome could affect BMD, but the protective effect of adipos-
ity or diabetes may counteract the negative influence of in-
flammation on bone mass.
Our study has several limitations. Because our data are
cross-sectional, we have limited ability to assess the temporal
relationship between the metabolic syndrome and FN-BMD.
Also, we did not have DXA measurements on nonfemoral
bone. It is possible that the effects of the metabolic syndrome
on BMD vary by anatomic site.
In conclusion, we found higher BMD among subjects with
the metabolic syndrome, in which obesity appeared to be the
main component increasing FN-BMD. Whereas adjusted FN-
BMD stratified by BMI was similar between those subjects
with and without the metabolic syndrome, an increase in the
number of the metabolic syndrome components and diabetes
were associated with a higher BMD. Longitudinal studies
that include more information regarding inflammation will
be helpful in better characterizing this relationship.
