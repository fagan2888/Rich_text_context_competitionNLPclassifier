Introduction
In the last two decades, the viability and justifiability of the
traditional model of scholarly publishing has been called into
question by advocates of open access scholarship. Under the
traditional model publicly funded researchers submit their
articles and research reports for free to journals, and the insti-
tutions which have paid for the research in the first place, and
employ the researchers, must purchase it back from commer-
cial publishers at lofty prices. Members of the public and
other potential users who are often meant to benefit from this
research are rarely able to afford access despite the fact that
the research itself has been largely subsidized by the state
and the costs of dissemination have been reduced to zero by
the new technologies. Hence, the scholarly publishing sys-
tem itself has become a source of financial pressure as well
as normative tensions (Willinsky, 2006). In 2012, these
issues came to the fore with the emergence of the so-called
"Academic Spring" featuring boycotts of journals published
the leading science publisher, Elsevier, after the company
had supported legislative efforts in the United States to ban
open access mandates.
Policymakers and even major commercial publishers have
announced their readiness to embrace some form of transition
to open access. National governments in the United Kingdom
and the United States have announced or established regula-
tory regimes requiring researchers with public support to
make their peer reviewed articles available for free online.
One option is the so-called "Gold" route to open access (Gold
OA), which involves the publication of journals providing
immediate free content on line. In this case, the costs of pub-
lication are either subsidized by third parties, or covered by
author publication charges (APCs) levied on researchers or
their funding institutions. Another approach is the "Green"
route (Green OA) in which authors deposit preprint versions
of their articles into freely accessible digital archives after
they have been published in traditional subscription-funded
journals. Both varieties of OA have steadily grown over the
last decade. In fact, it is estimated that nearly 17% of articles
indexed in ISI's Web of Knowledge index are now published
in Gold OA journals (Laakso & Bjork, 2012). The Directory
of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) lists almost 7,000 journals
that are now published for free online. The worldwide propor-
tion of peer reviewed research available through Green OA--
deposited by authors in open archives--is already estimated
at 25% and is likely to grow stronger as self-archiving man-
dates become more prevalent (Gargouri et al., 2012).

Open Access, Megajournals, and MOOCs:
On the Political Economy of Academic
Unbundling
Richard Wellen1
Abstract
The development of "open" academic content has been strongly embraced and promoted by many advocates, analysts,
stakeholders,andreformersinthesectorofhighereducationandacademicpublishing.Thetwomostwell-knowndevelopments
are open access scholarly publishing and Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), each of which are connected to disruptive
innovations enabled by new technologies. Support for these new modes of exchanging knowledge is linked to the expectation
that they will promote a number of public interest benefits, including widening the impact, productivity, and format of
academic work; reforming higher education and scholarly publishing markets; and relieving some of the cost pressures in
academia. This article examines the rapid emergence of policy initiatives in the United Kingdom and the United States to
promote open content and to bring about a new relationship between the market and the academic commons. In doing so,
I examine controversial forms of academic unbundling such as open access megajournals and MOOCs and place each in the
context of the heightened emphasis on productivity and impact in new regulatory regimes in the area of higher education.

This article examines the often ambiguous prospects and
implications of open access alternatives, not only in aca-
demic publishing but also in the more controversial case of
massive open online courses known as Massive Online Open
Courses (MOOCs). My goal is to examine the logic and con-
sequences of recent support for open content by governments
and policy communities and to connect this to the unbun-
dling of academic functions that the new digital academic
commons allows. Unbundling is central to new open content
formats because, as information becomes more portable and
easier to copy and share, new, potentially "disruptive" ways
are created for discovering, managing, using, and aggregat-
ing academic material and educational resources. According
to the theory of disruptive innovation, these new kinds of
services can bring about structural changes to markets and
industries by initially serving a previously underrecognized
or unconventional user need before scaling up to competing
with mainstream providers (Christensen & Raynor, 2003). A
frequently cited example is the demise of Encyclopedia
Brittanica by the rise of Internet-enabled editing used by
Wikipedia. Often disruption is driven by technologies that
allow important parts of a task to be modularized and per-
formed more efficiently or conveniently by new agents or
intermediaries empowered by that technology (Christensen
& Eyring, 2011). One question that emerges in our context is
whether open access megajournals and MOOCs can be cat-
egorized as disruptive innovations.1 For example, as access
to scholarly content becomes less restricted and more modu-
larized, responsibility for filtering that content can be
assigned to any number of agents, or even crowdsourced by
informally organized groups of peers after publication. After
surveying the political economy of open access I examine
how the rise of post-publication reviewing and academic
social networking may challenge traditional roles and func-
tions performed by publishers, libraries, and other informa-
tion intermediaries. MOOCs are an equally disruptive case
of unbundling. In one sense, online courses simply allow
higher education institutions to save money by outsourcing
teaching work through the use of technologies that make
teaching content portable. More importantly, however,
MOOCs are part of a larger socioeconomic shift that would
diversify the supply chain of higher education, transferring
more academic functions to independent educational ser-
vices that are offered on a freelancing basis.
It can be argued that both open access scholarship and
MOOCs offer the laudable goal of realizing the full social,
economic, and scientific potential of free sharing among
potential users of knowledge in a digital age. But in what
follows, I argue that while these forms of open content lib-
eralize the exchange and circulation of knowledge they
also create a new research and education architecture
designed to privatize the means of academic production
(Marginson, 2009; Neary & Winn, 2013). Indeed, open
access and academic unbundling signal the introduction of
new forms of academic stratification and competition as
well as controversial new political and economic instru-
ments for the external governance of the academic sphere.
The Journal, the Market, and the
Academic Commons
It is often acknowledged that the value of knowledge and
ideas is best realized when they are shared (Hess & Ostrom,
2007). In this connection, knowledge is commonly called a
public good, which refers to its qualities of being nonrival-
rous and nonexcludable (Tilak, 2008). Knowledge is nonri-
valrous in the sense that one person's use of it does not
diminish the amount available for others to use. In fact, shar-
ing ideas actually tends to improve them by promoting criti-
cism and revision as well as allowing them to circulate
among complementary users. Ideas are also nonexcludable
in the sense that at least some of their value is lost by limiting
their supply through rationing or by setting restrictions on
someone else's use of them. Any measure that makes an idea
harder to reuse destroys some of its potential value. Due to
these public good characteristics of knowledge, it is efficient
for society to create and mandate a sphere--which we can
call an academic commons--within which knowledge is
available for collective consumption and reciprocal use
among competent users. Indeed, providing subsidies and
market protection for basic research is important for social
and economic well-being. As a result, even neoliberal gov-
ernments fiercely committed to the use of market mecha-
nisms typically ensure that the sphere of curiosity-based
knowledge creation is largely structured as a commons where
the creation and use of ideas is not constrained by barriers of
price and permission.
The exchange of ideas through scholarly journals is an
important practice sustaining such a commons. Authors will-
ingly forego royalties for their contributions to the commons
because they receive compensation in the form of recognition
for the impact they have made. This eventually yields tangi-
ble benefits by helping academics get hired by an institution
dedicated to knowledge creation and dissemination. Of
course, journals themselves have long been provided through
market-based production rather than through exchanges in
the gift economy. That is because print journals themselves,
unlike the ideas they contain, require the expenditure of
scarce resources for each unit produced and distributed. The
incentive for providers to produce those texts and to invest in
rigorous quality control would be removed if access to them
was not rationed by price and if intellectual property rights
could not be used to make those texts artificially scarce
(Courant, 2008). So while ideas are public goods, scholarly
journals are not. In this case, the tension between the market
and the academic commons is resolved by research libraries
which have been established with public support to ensure
that research texts can be purchased by academic institutions
and then shared among members of those institutions.
Therefore, while the production and distribution of research
Wellen 3
texts is in large measure a commercial enterprise, the fact that
the research library serves as a market proxy for academic
communities means that those texts need not be rationed by
price among those end users (Lyman, 1999).
Of course, this harmonious relationship between the com-
mons and the market is not perfect. The system of market
provision means that many other potential end users of those
texts are excluded and many institutions cannot afford to buy
those texts, or must sacrifice other important goals to do so.
What is compelling about the digital environment is that it
removes important obstacles for the free sharing and open
access provision of scholarly texts by eliminating the mar-
ginal costs of publishing. Open access advocates therefore
argue that the scope of the text sharing activities in the aca-
demic commons no longer needs to be limited by barriers of
price and permission (Suber, 2012). Of course, open access-
does not eliminate the costs of publishing activities such as
managing peer review and marketing which, in the absence
of artificial scarcity, must be supported by other potentially
controversial means such as subsidy, author-side payments
or even volunteer effort. The research community and its
stakeholders may also believe that open content implies less
effective quality filtering.
Indeed, academics are accustomed to dissemination lying
within the control of a journal which has proven itself to the
community as a credible filter of content and certifier of aca-
demic achievement. It is perhaps not surprising that recent
surveys show that members of the academic community
embrace open access and the demise of artificial scarcity as
an ideal, but are concerned that such developments might
jeopardize the system of peer review (Taylor and Francis
Group, 2013).
Thus, the subscription business model that remains domi-
nant today rests upon a highly valued partnership of publish-
ers with the academic commons (Wellen, 2004). Moreover,
at the heart of the current scholarly communications system
is a business model that has evolved over many decades in
response to the idiosyncratic nature of the academic publish-
ing market. Academic journals typically have small audi-
ences and a weak capacity to attract advertising, which
makes them quite different from other types of commercial
information products like trade books and magazines. But
this disadvantage is offset by the fact that journal publishers
do not have to support academic authors and reviewers who,
instead, are paid by higher education institutions (HEIs)--
and ultimately the public purse--to participate in an intel-
lectual commons in which they are expected to contribute
out of professional duty. Furthermore, academic readers
have a strong preference to have their libraries provide access
to everything in their fields of inquiry. In this sense, the
demand for scholarly journals tends to be highly inelastic as
each title cannot be easily substituted for another. Moreover,
because many academic readers have unpriced access
through their research libraries, they have little reason to
concern themselves with whether the price of a given journal
reflects its value (Bergstrom, 2001). In effect, the end user
(the academic researcher) is relatively insulated from the
market. In addition, the value of scholarly journals is hard to
observe except by small groups of experts working within
narrow specialties. For all these reasons, market forces argu-
ably cannot exert a very strong downward pressure on prices.
It is not surprising, then, that major academic journal pub-
lishers today such as Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley & Sons
manage to obtain extremely high profit margins of between
32% and 45% (Morrison, 2012) by selling expensive institu-
tional subscriptions to research libraries. Some have sug-
gested that market forces might bring prices down if
academic readers were to buy access to articles on a pay-per-
view basis (Bergstrom, 2010), but such a model would con-
flict with the collegial ethos and the logic of collective
provision which is a hallmark of the academic commons. If
faculty members and students were expected to apply for
journal or article vouchers on an individual basis this would
result in administrative inefficiencies, managerial interfer-
ence with academic decision making and possible competi-
tion among academic disciplines.
The commercial publishing industry owes its strength and
resilience to the strategies developed in response to the mas-
sive expansion in the rate of research output since the late
1950s. During most of this period, academic journal output
has tracked the massive growth in national research budgets
and has expanded at 3% to 4% per year (Elsevier, 2011;
Mabe, 2003). Despite this growing market, publishers have
had to focus their business strategies around product differen-
tiation rather than market expansion for individual titles. This
is partly due to the fact that research expansion has taken
place through the specialization of academic subfields, each
requiring its own journals. The recognized journals in each
field acquire the status of "must have" titles, thereby creating
inelastic demand that augments the market power of the pub-
lisher (McGuigan & Russell, 2008). Another equally impor-
tant type of product differentiation is that between high and
low prestige journals. To understand this, we have to recall
that the journal market is a unique kind of "two-sided" market
(McCabe & Snyder, 2007) in which prestige is the key cur-
rency. In any two-sided market, the commercial fortunes and
opportunities for platform providers (publishers) depend
upon finding strategies for serving the needs of interdepen-
dent users. The job of the academic journal platform is to cre-
ate "network effects," connecting readers who demand trusted
quality filters with authors who demand impact or attention
(Edlin & Rubinfeld, 2004; Franck, 2012). Because the quality
indicator of a journal is its prestige, which is acquired through
selectivity and exclusion, each journal tries to boost or retain
its market power by attracting more submissions from impact-
hungry authors while limiting the final volume of published
content (Edlin & Rubinfeld, 2004). One strategy that publish-
ers have adopted in response to the inherent limits of
title-specific content expansion is the acquisition of estab-
lished independent journals (McGuigan & Russell, 2008).
4 SAGE Open
Industry-wide profitability and concentration has perhaps
been boosted most by tying the marketing of new journals to
the network effects already enjoyed by clusters of established
journals. To accomplish this, the major academic publishers
have developed multiyear licensing arrangements called "Big
Deals" that bundle together high and low impact journals into
single packages which are sold in bulk form to research librar-
ies (Frazier, 2001). Bundling of this type makes it easier for
publishers to create a captive market for newer (lower tier)
journals that otherwise would have to compete on an even
playing field with new journals offered by smaller publishers.
To achieve this, established commercial publishers can lever-
age their "reputational capital" that is already attached to their
established journals (McCabe & Snyder, 2007, p. 24). They
can also spread their fixed investments in scalable value-
added services such as article retrieval systems across their
different tiers of journals (McCabe & Snyder, 2005).
Following these strategies creates significant entry barriers
for would-be publishers lacking either established relation-
ships with libraries or preexisting distribution arrangements
(Edlin & Rubinfeld, 2004).
The concentration of market power in the academic jour-
nal industry is almost certainly due to the Big Deal model.
Bundle pricing virtually guarantees that library acquisitions
budgets are tied up by established publishers whose new
titles always have an advantage over those offered by smaller
publishers who cannot discount individual titles through
aggregate pricing (Bergstrom 2010; Edlin & Rubinfeld,
2004). This advantage is further reinforced by the fact that so
many of the journals published by the large firms have a
highly valued digitized back catalogue to which institutions
can gain access only by continuing to subscribe. Moreover,
these bundles are negotiated under nondisclosure agree-
ments, which reinforces the tendency to oligopolistic pricing
(Van Noorden, 2013). Of course, the economics of zero mar-
ginal cost dissemination also allows publishers to add new
journals to the bulk electronic collections sold to each addi-
tional customer, ensuring that small and large research librar-
ies alike can subscribe to virtually all of the titles provided in
a publisher's portfolio (Best, 2009; Odlyzko, 2013). Big
Deal packages are typically priced according to a usage
based formula scaled to each institution (Walkiers, 2008).
The effect of this arrangement is to spread the burden of pay-
ing for a system-wide standard of access among all institu-
tions. This is how publishers have been able to adopt an
access-friendly approach without embracing open access
itself (Morrison, 2013; Odlyzko, 2013; Poynder, 2011b).
The dominant academic publishing model described
above is hardly a print-era relic; rather, it is strongly sup-
ported by the very economics of digital information that is
used to justify open access. For example, the contemporary
publishing infrastructure is built around an array of digitally
enabled services such as indexing, retrieval, and reference
management, which are complements to the core business of
content provision. Libraries in particular are being disrupted
by these technologies (Lewis, 2004). Indeed, the fact that
publishers now provide much of the software, technology,
research tools, and metadata services shows that they are tak-
ing over many of the functions of libraries themselves, bring-
ing economies of scale by avoiding duplication of services
among institutions (Odlyzko, 2013; Pinfield, 2008). It can be
assumed that the Big Deal is at least partly responsible for
the fact that academic researchers increased the number of
articles they read by 87% between 1977 and 2005 (King &
Tenopir, 2009).2 This coincides with the period of the growth
of the commercial publishing sector and can be taken to indi-
cate the synergy between digital content delivery and Big
Deal packages. Moreover, efficiencies related to digitization
are evident in the vast productivity differences between the
market for journals--which are predominantly digital--and
books, which are still mostly printed. In the 25 years ending
in 2011, member institutions of the Association of Research
Libraries (ARL) paid 402% more for 333% more journals.
By comparison, the same libraries paid 90% more for only
10% more monographs (ARL, 2012). In effect, the Big Deal
and the Internet have turned the scholarly journal industry
into what Anderson (2006) has termed a "long tail" market
whereby scalable distribution systems have supported the
massive expansion in the number of small, specialized out-
lets for scholarship.
Defining and Contesting the Open
Access Alternative
Commercial publishers have become the favored intermedi-
aries in scholarly communication on the strength of a dis-
semination model that has made them successful partners to
the academic commons. Nevertheless, pressure to promote
open access alternatives has never been stronger (The
Economist, 2013). For the past decade, the demand for
change has come from advocates within the academic com-
munity, as well as activists and innovators within the schol-
arly communication profession (Wellen, 2004). While many
advocates have emphasized openness as a principle implied
by the vocation of science and scholarship, it is evident that
real change is being driven by a consensus about the impor-
tance of openness for the productivity and progress of sci-
ence. There is now near unanimity among national research
granting councils--and the politicians that oversee them--
that OA can help ensure the maximum economic and social
impact for publicly funded scientific research. As of April
2013, all publicly funded research output published in schol-
arly journals by U.K. authors came to be covered by enforce-
able open access mandates. This policy was inspired by the
government-commissioned Finch report which concluded
that open access will bring "social and economic benefits"
by improving the flow of knowledge not only within but also
beyond the research community (Finch, 2012, p. 28). Science
Europe has declared that open access would "have huge
value for the research community and will offer significant
Wellen 5
social and economic benefits to potential users in industry,
charitable and public sectors, to individual professionals, and
to the general public" (Science Europe, 2013, p. 3). Finally,
in early 2013, the U.S. White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP; 2013) issued a memo directing
agencies to ensure open access to publications resulting from
federal funds.
Notably, the Finch report and the Obama administration's
OSTP memo emphasized the importance of ensuring that
content is not only free but also available for reuse with mini-
mal restriction. The idea is that if articles are published under
open licenses this would further contribute to research pro-
ductivity by facilitating text-mining and better research dis-
covery methods. The Finch report took special pains to
emphasize the advantages of Gold OA publishing, including
its cost advantages over subscription publishing. Indeed, it
has been estimated that the average cost of a peer reviewed
article in open access journals could be as low as $400 to
$2,500, well below the $5,000 in sales revenue that publish-
ers earn under the current subscription model (Finch, 2012;
Houghton et al., 2009; Morrison, 2013). Faced with the
apparent momentum of open access policy even the leading
commercial publishers have begun to include open access as
a core part of their strategic vision. Nearly all of the major
academic publishers have also converted many of their toll
access titles to "hybrid" journals allowing authors to elect to
pay an optional publication fee--often over $3,000--to
enable free online access to those without a subscription.
The U.K. OA strategy ultimately implemented by the
Research Councils UK (RCUK) places a significant empha-
sis on both Gold and Green OA, despite the initial controver-
sial priority given to Gold. Block funding has been allocated
to a special fund at each institution which can be used to pay
APC's for Gold OA. Authors also have the option to publish
in a subscription-funded journal so long as the journal allows
Green OA, in which case authors would be required to
deposit a refereed preprint version of their article in an open
access repository typically with an embargo period of 6 to 24
months after publication. Tension between the two models of
OA dominated the policy formulation process in the United
Kingdom, especially in parliamentary hearings where the
recommendations of the Finch commission were met with
great scrutiny. This tension illustrates the possible clash
among the disparate stakeholder interests that will likely
shape the future of open access. The Minister of Business,
Innovation and Skills (BIS) argued that Gold OA is superior
because it allows immediate access and typically unrestricted
reuse, thereby maximizing research impact (Willetts, 2013).
Criticisms of Gold OA were voiced by a range of stakehold-
ers from OA advocates and activists to the influential Russell
Group of research intensive universities. These groups
argued that if the United Kingdom unilaterally becomes an
early adopter of mandatory OApublishing (rather than Green
self-archiving) then it runs the risk of having to pay APC's
for the research output of U.K. authors while still paying for
journal subscriptions to gain access to the output from the
rest of the world (The Russell Group, 2013). Many publish-
ers demand higher APCs before they will grant liberal reuse
rights (under Creative Commons cc-by licenses, for exam-
ple) and this, too, would lead to the United Kingdom paying
individually for benefits that are enjoyed by all. Some critics
of the policy argued that it would be best to allow Gold OA
to evolve after Green OA becomes widespread so that pub-
lishers would be constrained to adopt a more affordable ver-
sion of "author-pays" publishing (Houghton, Rasmussen, &
Swan, 2013). The strongest opponents of Gold OA worry
that any approach to allocating publication support may
introduce rationing of funds and controversial and non-colle-
gial determinations about which scholarly contributions and
disciplines would or should be eligible for support.
Green OA has its shortcomings as well, primarily because
it is parasitical upon the subscription model rather than an
alternative to it. For this reason, publishers often claim they
need an embargo period of up to 36 months after publication
to guard against subscription cancellations. Moreover, such
publishers are usually not prepared to allow authors to
deposit the final copy of record. The policymaking process
of 2012-2013 demonstrated that publishers will engage in
active lobbying to ensure that embargo periods are set long
enough to protect their highly profitable subscription model.
In the case of the RCUK policy, the preferred embargo for
science, technical, engineering, and medicine (STEM) mate-
rial was been set at 6 months and 12 months for social sci-
ence and humanities (SSH) research, but where money to
pay APCs is not available publishers are permitted to double
the embargo period. Both the Association of American
Publishers and Elsevier supported the Obama administra-
tion's open access memo of early 2013 but only, it seems,
after the government promised that it would allow publishers
to apply for lengthened embargo periods for certain disci-
plines (Association of American Publishers, 2013; Wise,
2013). In the United Kingdom, some publishers have actu-
ally lengthened their embargo periods since the new RCUK
policy came into effect (Poynder, 2013). There is a growing
fear that the new policy will encourage hybrid publishing so
that journals can offer immediate open access options
to authors for a fee while still maintaining regular subscrip-
tion revenue streams. To avoid accusations of "double dip-
ping," some publishers have agreed to waive APCs for
researchers who work for institutions that subscribe to their
journals (Gibney, 2013; Science Europe, 2013). OA-only
publishers like Public Library of Science (PLoS) have
warned that by making subscriptions and APCs interchange-
able in this way the dominant publishers can perpetuate non-
transparent bundle pricing which is the hallmark of their
business model (Neylon, 2013, p. 21). In its written testi-
mony to the U.K. parliamentary hearings, PLoS complained
that established subscription based publishers were given
greater influence over the hearings than firms and organiza-
tions already specializing in open access (Neylon, 2013).
6 SAGE Open
Finally, it is important to recognize that support for open
access often breaks down along disciplinary lines. In STEM
fields, communication of research findings is much more
time-sensitive than in SSH fields which means that even
short Green OA embargo periods may not prompt subscrip-
tion cancellations. By contrast, articles in SSH journals have
a longer half-life, so that delayed access may be a tolerable
trade-off for canceling subscriptions. Gold OA has received
an especially cool reception in SSH fields as it requires pay-
ments made from research grants which are less common
among SSH researchers. It is therefore no surprise that so
many of the flagship Gold OA publishers are concentrated in
the STEM fields, while many publishers and scholarly asso-
ciations in the SSH fields view both forms of OA as a poten-
tial threat. In the 2013 U.K. parliamentary hearings, some
publishers urged caution about adopting open access for SSH
fields, citing not only the lower funding available for APCs
in such disciplines but also their limited economic impact
(SAGE Publications, 2013). Some SSH academic associa-
tions see open access as a threat to academic freedom in view
of the fact that authors in heterodox fields or niche areas may
be less able to pay for publication (Political Studies
Association of the UK, 2013). The SSH community is less
concerned about boosting research productivity than it is
about avoiding a pattern of publishing reform in which the
market would dictate scholarly priorities and resources
would be managed in a way that upsets the level playing field
between more and less affluent disciplines. In this sense, the
reform of research communication has become closely tied
to familiar contests around the role of markets and impact
agendas in academic governance.
Consequences of Unbundling and
"Disruption" in the Open Access
Ecosystem
In spite of the contested nature of open access, there are good
reasons to concede its "inevitability" (Lewis, 2012), and it is
therefore important to anticipate changes to the role of jour-
nals in a transformed scholarly communications system. Two
questions emerge in particular. First, will OA publishing
achieve cost savings or otherwise bring a disruptive chal-
lenge to the market power of publishers, and, if so, how?
Secondly, will free access accelerate the "disruption" of the
journal itself which will now have to compete with new plat-
forms such as academic social networks and other intermedi-
aries that can perform quality control, filtering, and content
discovery (Pickard, 2012)?
In terms of the first question of market power, we have
seen that governments in both the United Kingdom and
United States have been responsive to many of the concerns
of academic publishers regarding the impact of the new regu-
latory regime. Indeed, even if Gold OAwere to become more
prevalent publishers may try to retain the lucrative system of
fixed pricing arrangements with institutions. Of course,
many observers have argued that open access publishing
would bring more transparent pricing and competition as this
system allows authors to be more discriminating about where
to publish than libraries can be in their decisions of which
journals to purchase (Bergstrom & Bergstrom, 2004; Carroll,
2011; McCabe & Snyder, 2005). But there are some reasons
to doubt whether Gold OA would bring down costs as
expected. Clearly, Gold OA would not by itself diminish the
mutually reinforcing incentives of both publishers and
authors to engage in the prestige-driven publishing behavior
that currently drives prices and profit margins up (Brembs &
Munafò, 2013). To address this problem, the RCUK has
issued policy guidance asking institutions to ensure that
decisions about where their authors publish are price sensi-
tive (RCUK, 2013). On the other hand, a recent industry
study argues that:
Moving to OA does not change the chief motivation of the
author, i.e., to be published in the highest status journal possible.
Researchers rely on journal titles to provide an external measure
of the quality of their research. Established journals provide
prestige and validation for a researcher and both are key to
furthering career prospects and securing funding. (HSBC, 2013)
Hence, authors and HEIs remain involved in a deeply
rooted competition for impact and prestige which may cause
price inelasticity to be carried over into the author-pays mar-
ket (Bergstrom, 2010). Moreover, it has been argued that
many of the structures of academic life encourage a research
productivity arms race which has resulted in opportunistic
publishing behavior and an expensive increase in the ratio of
published articles (and filtering activities) to ideas or find-
ings (Baveye, 2010). The fact that review and promotion
committees include members from different specialties--or
from management--may encourage an emphasis on count-
ing publications rather than evaluating their quality.
Furthermore, increasingly intense competition for good aca-
demic employment means that fledgling researchers need to
score as many publication points as possible. The Finch
(2012) report candidly anticipates that while attempts to
ration APC funds might constrain publication overkill, they
also would be controversial.
The question of OA's possibly disruptive impact on the
form of academic publishing cannot be separated from the
question of cost and efficiency. Some have suggested that
the combination of free content and ubiquitous networking
means that the functions associated with research sharing no
longer need to be tightly coupled. Earl (2008) argues that
information abundance could allow research filtering and
dissemination to be produced and paid for separately, and
such unbundling might improve both the efficiency and qual-
ity of each (Earl, 2008). In a similar vein, Harnad (2010)
suggests that OA journals could contribute to beneficial pub-
lishing reform by charging fees at the point of submission
Wellen 7
rather than upon the final publication of accepted articles.
His reasoning is that publication costs are based on the num-
ber of submissions and if each instance of peer review was
priced, independent of whether it led to acceptance or rejec-
tion, it would remove the subsidy that some authors effec-
tively pay to others who make "unrealistic submissions."
Priem and Hemminger (2012) argue that the Internet allows
editing, peer review, and dissemination to be unbundled so
these functions can be delivered by different providers and
priced separately. They argue that peer review services--and
peer reviewers themselves--could compete for monetary
rewards or social/professional recognition by selling ratings
or "stamps." Such competition would create a self-regulating
market so that the price at which outsourced review services
would be able to sell stamps would be dependent directly on
their trusted track record.
There are already a number of examples of independent
commercial providers of unbundled publishing services. For
example, a new company called Rubriq currently offers a
standalone peer review service which it sells to authors for
$500 to $700. Reviewers are paid a fee and authors receive
very quick review and a standardized numerical scorecard
for their submitted work. The resulting "R-score" can be
used to provide advice on publication venues and can pro-
vide subscribing journals with an "initial filter" that can help
economize on downstream editorial and reviewing costs
(Collier, 2013). This model of unbundled prepublication fil-
tering may limit the duplication of filtering instances by pro-
viding "portable" reviews that can accompany subsequent
submissions (Collier, 2013). As a referral service between
authors and journals Rubriq carries with it a strong incentive
for disclosure and sharing of information, overcoming some
of the nontransparency of traditional peer review. Outsourced
peer review--or the commodification of peer review--
would not necessarily add another layer of cost to the pub-
lishing process if it offset the price journals currently charged
for some of its services. Like a journal, a peer review service
is a multisided market (or networking platform), which has
to satisfy the interdependent needs of complementary groups
of users. In this case, however, the user pairs are not authors/
readers, as is the case with journals, but rather authors/jour-
nals. Rubriq's advantage is that it will pay reviewers and pro-
vide article recommendations to journals for free, and
therefore has the potential to link authors to a very large
number of publishing opportunities. However, the model
could mean that authors pay twice: once for review and a
second time to publish. This is unlikely to attract authors
seeking to publish in top tier journals as the latter would not
accept outsourced reviews nor offer discounted services for
pre-reviewed submissions. The prospect for outsourced peer
review to become a full-fledged disruptive innovation faces
some obvious limits. For example, Rubriq's services would
likely be concentrated in the middle and lower tiers of the
journal market where the probability of article acceptance is
higher and APC's are lower or discounted. Of course if peer
review is commodified there might be unintended conse-
quences flowing from the fact that authors or their funders
would have to pay for failure. This could encourage tighter
rationing of APC funding and discouraging risk-averse
authors from submitting to the best journals.
We do not yet know whether unbundled peer review plat-
forms will succeed as a business model. But it is clear that a
certain kind of unbundling of peer review already lies at the
heart of the publishing strategy and practices of megajour-
nals. Open access megajournals, such as PLoS One, Scientific
Reports, Springer Plus, and SAGE Open have begun to cre-
ate an alternative market segment to both high prestige OA
journals and high priced subscription journals (Van Noorden,
2013). Megajournals accept articles for publication based on
a simplified threshold while the peer review process is accel-
erated, screening only for accuracy, validity and scientific
soundness rather than novelty or importance. Accordingly,
megajournals typically eschew traditional prestige competi-
tion characteristic of traditional journals. Indeed, most of
these titles maintain an extremely wide transdisciplinary
scope across the sciences, the life sciences, or even humani-
ties and social sciences. PLoS One publishes thousands of
articles per year and therefore positions itself somewhere
between an archive and a traditional journal. Its publishers
assume that relevance and importance can best be judged
after publication, especially since reliable methods for aggre-
gating informal assessment are already flourishing in an
environment which includes academic networking services.
When peer review is crowdsourced (or outsourced) articles
can more easily be judged on their own merits rather than by
the prestige of the journal in which they are published.
Indeed, one of the key strategies of reform-minded OA pub-
lishers like PLoS is to introduce "article level" metrics to
replace journal ranking metrics such as impact factors (PLoS,
2013). In short, megajournals' selling point is that new net-
work-enabled tools for aggregating the decentralized judg-
ments of peers (Mounce, 2013) can justify the use of a
low-cost streamlined review process, which also provides
the service advantage of rapid turnover time from submis-
sion to publication.
Of course, full acceptance of megajournals may depend
on the legitimacy of informal review in the community using
web 2.0 communication including crowdsourcing among
peers as well as nonstandard metrics now known as "altmet-
rics" (Priem, Taraborelli, Groth, & Neylon, 2010). The cur-
rent academic reward system continues to give authors many
professional and self-interested reasons to send their work to
the prestigious journals in their fields. Likewise, there are
still pressures on academic adjudicators to use journal pres-
tige as a convenient proxy for quality (Suber, 2008). On the
other hand, megajournal supporters can point to the fact that
prestige-driven behavior is a major factor in driving up the
cost of academic publishing, and that prestige itself is not
always a reliable signaler of quality. It is well known, for
example, that the journal hierarchy contributes to the costly
8 SAGE Open
cycle of duplicate peer review whereby an author whose
paper is rejected by a relatively higher ranked journal will
make a follow up submission to a lower tier journal. This
process can repeat itself until the article finds its accepted
position in the journal hierarchy. The problem with this pat-
tern stems from the fact that prestige is a positional good.
Hence, when journals compete for prestige, that competition
does not increase the total amount of good papers published
but merely changes which rung of the ladder each paper
comes to occupy. In fact, journal impact factors and the com-
petition for journal prestige can actually cause quality to
diminish. For example, it has been widely acknowledged
that journals competing for rank may be tempted to publish
"hot papers" at the expense of quality or reliability (House of
Commons Science and Technology Committee, 2011). There
is growing evidence that prestige-driven competition creates
a publication bias that favors positive results, encourages
reporting of statistical anomalies and devalues heterodox
perspectives (Brembs & Munafò, 2013; Kapellar, 2010;
Rice, 2013).3 Finally, many good papers are rejected merely
because they fall outside of a given journal's relevance crite-
ria. If many of those articles are eventually published after
successive rounds of peer review, then it can be argued that
the high acceptance rate of megajournals should not be dis-
paraged as weak filtering but rather praised as cost-efficient
compression of the prepublication review phase. Wardle
(2012) has shown, for example, that ecology papers pub-
lished in PLoS One are of comparable quality (as measured
by citations) to those published in many far more selective
specialist ecology journals.
Megajournals, then, represent a potentially innovative
way for addressing costly review cycles and streamlining
multitiered publishing strategies. In particular, they can bring
in author fees from thousands of papers per year, and there-
fore may allow publishers to monetize the same volume of
research output as the traditional publishing model but
potentially at a lower cost (Van Noorden, 2013). Indeed, it
has been argued that PLoS One generates revenues to cross-
subsidize affiliated flagship publications such as PLoS
Biology that would not otherwise be sustainable on a stand-
alone basis (Poynder, 2011a). PLoS One's high volume
model of publication combined with an APC of $1,350 per
article can be more profitable than the $2,900 charged by its
flagship sibling. For its part, Springer is candid about its plan
to use its megajournal Springer Plus to economize on review-
ing costs by "cascading" rejected articles from its flagship
journals (Ishii, 2012). In view of their potential to become
high volume operations megajournals are likely to seek first
mover advantage. This appears to be the case with SAGE
Open, a multidisciplinary journal in SSH which in early
2013 reduced its APC to $99 so as to position itself for the
long term ascendancy of OA in the less affluent SSH fields
(Howard, 2013; Robinson, 2013).
One challenge megajournals face if they are expected to
redefine the market is that their defection from prestige
competition leaves them with a business model that may be
poorly aligned with reviewer and editor motivations. In the
academic "gift economy," reviewers must sacrifice time that
could be devoted to their own research, and in exchange,
they must be given some opportunity to influence their field,
gain exposure to the most current cutting edge research or
list their service to a prestigious journal on their CVs. But if
reviewing is reduced to a mere technical judgment of accu-
racy or if reviewer efforts are spread over too many submis-
sions a "tragedy of the reviewer commons" may result
(Hochberg, Chase, Gotelli, Hastings, & Naeem, 2009). One
attempt to address this problem might be the conversion of
megajournals to a cooperative-style membership model.
This is the inspiration behind the new OA megajournal
PeerJ, which covers biological and medical science. PeerJ's
revenue stream derives from lifetime membership fees (start-
ing at $99) providing for the continuing right to publish a set
number of articles per year, rather than from article process-
ing charges levied for each individual article accepted.
Contributors pay a modest fee for the right to submit, or a
higher fee if one elects to wait until acceptance. Each con-
tributor remains in good standing only if he or she partici-
pates in reviewing or post-publication commentary, which
ensures that all contributors to the journal are rewarded for
their commitment to the reviewer commons. This system of
commitment credits incentivizes researchers to volunteer for
reviewing and academic editing, which presumably helps
provide a level of administrative cost savings not available to
most competing journals.
Commercializing the Networked
Academic Commons
One must be careful not to exaggerate the importance of
megajournals. On one hand, they may play an important role
in overcoming the discontents of a research dissemination
model founded on artificial scarcity. On the other hand, they
are not likely to fully replace upper tier journals so long as
academic communities expect prepublication filtering to sig-
nal pathbreaking research. Nevertheless, crowdsourcing
technologies are becoming important complements to con-
ventional academic gatekeepers and there is every probabil-
ity new post-publication filters and metrics will allow
innovations like megajournals to "disrupt" important sectors
of the journal market (Mounce, 2013). Perhaps the most
important technological factor in the post-scarcity world of
scholarly communication is the role of software in analyzing
research impact at the level of the article and author rather
than the journal. Web 2.0 tools that monitor scholarly reputa-
tion and analyze usage and reading behavior can reduce the
amount of expensive human input that journals currently use
for relevance sorting (Nentwich & König, 2012). In the
words of disruptive innovation theory, this allows megajour-
nals and academic networks to "scale upward" (Christensen,
Horn, Caldera, & Soares, 2011, p. 23) so that they can rival
Wellen 9
traditional intermediaries (journals and libraries) rather than
simply become low-cost alternatives with a limited market.
Eventually, according to Priem (2013, p. 438), "editors and
reviewers [once] employed as proxy community assessors
will be replaced by the aggregated, collective judgments of
communities themselves."
Mendeley is probably one of the most exemplary services
for blending the functions of peer to peer academic network-
ing and dissemination in this way. It is a freely accessible
cloud-based research article manager and bibliographic data-
base that gives users convenient access to a personalized
library of articles from any workstation and also provides
annotation and bookmarking, as well as the capacity to share
one's library with collaborators. While Mendeley is an orga-
nizing tool available for free to researchers, it is also a potent
platform for aggregating data about the behaviors and inter-
ests of those researchers. It can generate recommendations
for articles based on comparisons with the reading interests
of similar users in its database and can also be used to ana-
lyze resource usage and measure the research impact and
productivity of scholars. Due to the power of its new crowd-
sourcing tools Mendeley was acquired by Elsevier in early
2013. Elsevier thereby acquired Mendeley's rich pool of user
generated data which can be used to help it improve and
enhance its larger array of scholarly information products
services and infrastructure (Henning, 2013). Therefore,
while Elsevier faces a decline in its ability to profit from arti-
ficially scarce information, the new tools for making
researcher behavior more transparent may help it develop
profitable services for managing and integrating all aspects
of the research process.
But these innovations may come at the price of creating
tensions between the market and the academic commons. For
example, as academic social networks make researcher
behavior far more transparent to publishers it may also
encourage the proliferation of greater performance monitor-
ing in a community that prizes its autonomy. As a result, the
new system of research communication could involve contro-
versial changes such as increased academic self-promotion
and more quantitative approaches to assessment (Nentwich &
König, 2012). On the other hand, given the role that academ-
ics play as self-governing producers, publishing giants like
Elsevier may be constrained to "play nice" in order to keep
the trust of the researcher community (Dobbs, 2013).
Lessons From Another Form of
Unbundling: MOOCs and Online
Education
The recent emergence of Massive Open Online Courses or
MOOCs has introduced another version of "disruptive"
unbundling connected with the academic open content move-
ment. New start-up companies such as Udacity, EDx, and
Coursera have begun to provide free online access to mass-
produced courses taught by leading faculty members at the
world's most prestigious universities. In the case of MOOCs,
students do not pay fees to the content provider for basic
enrolment in the course, nor do they receive credit from the
content-providing institution. Social networking, interactive
services, and automated grading or peer assessment are pro-
vided by the platform provider, as is a nominal certificate for
the completion of assignments. MOOCs have become attrac-
tive because their technology brings modularity to several
components of higher education content such as lectures and
recordable demonstrations to reach mass audiences in a flex-
ible and accessible on-demand format. In the meantime, the
brand and market power of the elite institutions which typi-
cally provide the content is strengthened by unbundling con-
tent from its local institutional context and making it available
through mass, zero marginal cost distribution. The elite insti-
tutions do not award credit for students completing these
courses and therefore can retain their exclusive status even as
they disseminate part of their product for mass consumption.
Although MOOCs may be considered open in the sense of
"free to try," they are not offered under an open license. Any
use of the content or services for academic credit-bearing
purpose is restricted and requires payment to the MOOC pro-
vider (Coursera, 2013).
In most cases, MOOCs are used as a flexible educational
resource by nontraditional learners or individuals satisfying
their personal interest or their need for continuing education
or skills upgrading. But many theorists and observers of the
knowledge and information economy have long seen online
education as part of an austerity and productivity agenda in
the neoliberal reform of higher education (Jessop, 2012;
Noble, 1998). Sebastian Thrun, one of the leading MOOC
entrepreneurs, has offered the dramatic prediction that within
50 years the online transformation of higher education could
reduce the number of higher education institutions to 10.
Many lawmakers and political leaders have portrayed
MOOCs--or online education more generally--as one pos-
sible way to respond to growing concerns about the so-called
"higher education bubble" within their key middle class con-
stituencies (Cronin & Horton, 2009). The "bubble" is charac-
terized by the spiraling public and private costs of enrolments,
increased student debt, and anxiety over the value of
credentials.
Major reports by governments and consultants across
North America and major initiatives by private foundations
such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have strongly
promoted the use of learning technologies and online educa-
tion to increase the rates of degree completion and educa-
tional productivity (Walters, 2012). Meanwhile, proponents
of the theory of disruptive innovation have helped to con-
vince policymakers and higher education elites that HEIs
will be revolutionized by new online technologies that spread
instruction over large numbers of potential learners. This fits
the definition of a disruptive technology that would allow
new entrants to start at the low end of the higher education
market and scale their business model upward (Christenson
10 SAGE Open
et al., 2011). In this case, the result would be to liberate stu-
dents and taxpayers from the unitary model of vertically inte-
grated HEIs that hire expensive professors whose work
combines teaching with research and which assumes that all
students need education to be accompanied by a distinctive
physical, in-person environment for self-cultivation. As
Christensen and Eyring (2011) observed, under this domi-
nant model, the vast majority of HEIs have inherited the
DNA of the elite institutions in the sector, locking in the high
overhead costs of integrating the different higher education
functions. This has meant that the price of the package that
many HEIs provide has increased far more than its value for
society and most students. By contrast, a disrupted higher
education system would enable new education providers to
serve students who would be willing to pay less for the "good
enough" education that most students want, one that would
be convenient, useful and often available on demand from
anywhere (Christenson et al., 2011).
By distributing more teaching resources as globalized
commodities, or as pooled resources among partner institu-
tions, a disrupted higher education system would feature a
new teaching-only mission for many middle and lower tier
institutions. These institutions would place a more direct
emphasis on vocational relevance as well as access to on-site
mentoring in a blended teaching model. Unbundling higher
education would also make it possible to eliminate the hith-
erto unavoidable cross-subsidies that support the kind of
"unmarketable" research that disruption theorists say many
professorspursue(Horn&Christensen,2013;TheEconomist,
2012).4 The new market for academic talent would lower the
salary and status of many faculty and give them less auton-
omy over academic content creation and institutional gover-
nance. Such an outcome was anticipated in the dystopian
study by David Noble (1998) who argued that online educa-
tion would commodify higher education and lead to the cre-
ation of "digital diploma mills." Of course, many students
would continue to pay a premium for a fully bundled, high
status education offering a selective admission process,
direct contact with reputable academic researchers and an
opportunity to link learning with personal and civic develop-
ment. In this sense the prestige economy of higher education
would place a natural limit to disruption as an elite sector
would persist alongside of academic streamlining, just as
flagship scholarly journals likely would not be eliminated by
megajournals.
MOOCs' key market strategy is to exploit their modular-
ity and mass scale, which allows sufficient revenue genera-
tion even if only a relatively small percentage of students
buy premium services, or pay to use the courses for degree
credit. With its promise to expand the reach of the best pro-
fessors, the MOOC industry creates "winner take all" mar-
kets that may reinforce homogeneity of content rather than
long tail markets supporting niche curriculum areas (Rivard,
2013; Tabarrok, 2012). Because portable content must be
designed for cross-contextual application some have argued
that the format itself is optimized for material that is stan-
dardized, popular, trendy, uncontroversial, and safe
(Delbanco, 2013). Indeed, it has been acknowledged by
MOOC advocates that teaching resources that are designed
to be reusable across contexts can be very expensive to cus-
tomize for the curriculum of a given institution or academic
department (Bowen, 2013). For similar reasons, MOOCs are
far less able to bring their productivity advantage to more
"discursive" fields of knowledge and to courses where stu-
dent assessment cannot be automated (Bowen, 2013). In
light of these problems, it is not certain that academic quality
can be scaled up in the way that disruptive innovation theo-
rists expect, unless quality is redefined around what MOOCs
do well.
According to disruptive innovation theory, one of the
great benefits of academic unbundling is the unleashing of
market forces in the sphere of higher education. Of course
many have argued that some of the most important qualities
of higher education are threatened when it is treated as a mar-
ket commodity (Tilak, 2008). For example, higher education
resembles what economists call an experience good, since it
possess qualities that are hard for would-be consumers to
observe prior to consumption, which means that the informa-
tion requirements for efficient market provision cannot nor-
mally met. Markets also fail to recognize and reward those
(often intangible) benefits of higher education that cannot be
priced. Clearly many qualities of higher education would
be lost if we eliminated the subsidies and cross-subsidies that
support the many positive externalities that result from its
consumption (Tilak, 2008). For example, if market competi-
tion concentrates research in fewer flagship universities then
this could diminish the contributions that non-elite institu-
tions make to their regional networks and local communities
(Benkler, 2008). Others have remarked that higher education
markets encourage an academic "star system," which can put
strains on the cohesiveness of the academic community and
undermine the collective purpose needed for good gover-
nance within HEIs (Bousquet, 2008; Delbanco, 2013). It is
not surprising that MOOCs have become highly controver-
sial symbols of commodified education, educational stratifi-
cation, deprofessionalized academic work, and threats to
academic autonomy. Faculty groups and committees at some
elite institutions have voted to refuse to participate in the
development of MOOCs (Kolowich, 2013b) and some fac-
ulty members at would-be host institutions have resisted
administrators' demands that MOOCs be adopted in the cur-
riculum (Kolowich, 2013a).
MOOCS and Higher Education
Regulation
Finally, MOOCs are connected to a shifting, albeit contested,
regulatory environment for higher education systems. Bill
SB520 making its way through the California state legisla-
ture, strongly opposed by faculty groups, would require
Wellen 11
public HEIs to accept approved MOOCs for credit in cases
where there are insufficient resources to provide campus-
based courses. Educational outsourcing and unbundling have
already prompted the U.S. Education Department to allow
student aid to be approved for competency-based education
so that institutions can more easily award degree credits
based on prior learning (formal and informal) and nontradi-
tional courses rather than credit hours completed (Field,
2013). Support among politicians at the national level is
extraordinarily strong and has included presidential advo-
cacy for incentives that would encourage the adoption of
competency-based education and MOOCs as low-cost higher
education alternatives. The U.S. Education Secretary sees
MOOCs as meeting the need for "disruptive innovation in
higher education" (Marklein, 2013). Along the same lines,
the U.K. minister of Business Innovation and Skills has
emphasized his government's preference for separating
"degree awarding powers from teaching" so that alternative
private educators can provide content that can be used at tra-
ditional HEIs for degree credits (Baker, 2011). Many see
MOOCs as increasing the demand for--and credibility of--
alternative credentials, such as online educational "badges"
awarded for informal experience, that may one day gain
some acceptance alongside of conventional degrees in sec-
tors of the labor market (Lewin, 2012). Disruptive innova-
tion theory argues that as more content and academic services
can be assembled from different sources regulators and oth-
ers should adopt more flexible rules for defining the credit-
worthiness of different skills and learning experiences. One
prominent think tank proposes that students should be able to
use financial aid from non-accredited providers so that a
truly level playing field can be open to freelancing educators
and learning assessment services (Kelly & Hess, 2013). Of
course, as theorists of higher education have shown, increas-
ing the competition for subsidized students introduces incen-
tives to cut corners on quality and therefore creates pressure
for new types of regulation (Jongbloed, 2004).5
Along these lines, it is clear that MOOCs, unbundling and
outsourced content raise questions for accreditation systems.
One of the major purposes of accreditation is to provide sys-
tem-wide assurance regarding the value of degrees and
courses by certifying the institutions that develop them.
Thus, once an institution or program is accredited its aca-
demic governance system is deemed to be competent to
decide on the creditworthiness of courses. But it is not clear
what kind of accreditation model should apply to outsourced
or on-demand education or even the growing number of
institutions that utilize content from private educational ser-
vice firms (Eaton, 2012). A market for independent learning
assessment services--which includes companies such as
Degreed and learningcounts.org--has emerged to meet this
need in a way that parallels the new unbundled peer review
services we have seen in the case of scholarship. The
American Council of Education, has offered course-level
credit recommendations for five MOOCs offered by
Coursera, creating a model for the independent assessment
of creditworthiness of such courses (Lederman, 2013). Bill
SB520 in California would go a step beyond credit recom-
mendations by designating a state-wide pool of preapproved
online offerings. Elsewhere, governments are promoting the
creation of pan-university consortia that may create similar
pools of online offerings.6 Such examples show that the pros-
pect of academic unbundling has already begun to bring
changes to state or system-wide governance of HEI's in
order to accommodate the independent provision of more
portable academic content across institutions.
More than anything, MOOCs have sharpened existing
political battle lines. On one side, there are those who portray
traditional higher education models as enjoying too much
immunity from market forces and public demands for greater
academic efficiency and productivity. On the other side are
faculty groups and others who are struggling against a narra-
tive of disruption that sees higher education as a business
while discounting issues of academic quality, freedom, and
governance.
Conclusion
Policies promoting open content and disruptive forms of
academic unbundling are likely to transform the economics
and social structure of higher education and research com-
munication. Examples such as megajournals, academic net-
working services, and MOOCs are all connected to a
market-oriented reform of academic governance encour-
aged and managed by policymakers, key academic stake-
holders and the for-profit and nonprofit educational industry.
Echoing developments that have been observed in other
areas of the modern information economy (Fuchs, 2009;
Kostakis, 2012), the emerging gift economy in academic
content is closely coupled with new ways of commodifying
academic services.
In the case of research communication, we have seen that
governments and stakeholders have been prepared to
embrace open access scholarly publishing as a solution to a
dysfunctional journals market and as a way of realizing the
potential of the Internet to enhance the impact and produc-
tivity of research. At the same time, the various stakeholders
appear to have interests and incentives that may conflict
with some of these goals. For example, academics con-
cerned about openness is compatible with quality do not
seem to be prepared to fully repudiate the gatekeeping func-
tion of academic journals and publishers. Indeed, research-
ers place a high value on journal prestige due to the norms
and incentives of the academic commons, and this rein-
forces the market power of publishers in a way that can
undermine some of the goals of open access policies.
Furthermore, university elites and researchers fear that open
access mandates may threaten academic freedom and insti-
tutional autonomy, and therefore prefer to see slower and
more nuanced changes.
12 SAGE Open
On the other hand, we have also seen how online digital
access and networking will continue to transfer many of the
functions of research communication and content manage-
ment away from libraries to independent services operating
at the trans-institutional level. In such a context, the expanded
role of commercial providers will perhaps allow them to
regain some of the ground they will lose as they relinquish
artificial scarcity in favor of more open content. But the
interests of the academic commons may enjoy some built-in
protection from disruptive market forces. This nis because
the academic self-governance of research communities is
valued by many stakeholders, and therefore does scale well
beyond the institutional level. Likewise, the new web 2.0
networking platforms depend upon the "trust of user com-
munities" (Kostakis, 2012), which means that research ser-
vice providers will experience some pressure to be good
partners with the academic commons. Of course, there are
some fears that "pay to publish" could create a more uneven
playing field among academic disciplines and researchers
and also increase external academic auditing beyond an opti-
mal level. Reliance on centralized funding set aside for pub-
lishing means more control of academic work by managers
or even the state (Sabaratnam, 2012). At present, however,
the transition to open access publishing is seen as an exten-
sion of the state's long-standing support for knowledge cre-
ation as a public good. In this respect, policymakers appear
to be interested in reforming the traditional publishing model
without necessarily disrupting the academic commons which
that model is meant to serve.
In the case of MOOCs, we have observed a greater tension
between the market and the academic commons largely due
to a more deliberate policy of unbundling and disruption.
Unlike in the case of research communication, the policy dis-
course of reform has increasingly defined higher education as
a private good and the academic gatekeeping function of tra-
ditional HEIs is portrayed as a barrier to improved productiv-
ity. Despite the "openness" associated with their online
accessibility, MOOCs are meant to earn revenue within the
formal higher education system as content licensed for use by
institutions awarding degrees. Open educational resources
have become "try before you buy" marketing tools that pro-
vide a way of leveraging scale in a new, potentially highly
profitable educational industry. Moreover, the industry is
being aggressively enlisted by politicians keen to privatize
the delivery of educational services in the expectation that
this will help address the perceived higher education crises of
cost, access, completion and productivity. In the process, the
proliferation of portable and reusable educational resources--
as well as policies and technologies that encourage academic
freelancing--will likely expand the relative size of the teach-
ing-only sector in higher education and challenge traditional
practices of academic governance. One of the key goals is to
streamline academic work and loosen the tight coupling of
teaching with the expensive pursuit of research and institu-
tional rank (Christensen et al., 2011). If the productivity
agenda of disruptive innovation succeeds on the scale imag-
ined by its proponents, the academic autonomy of institutions
and academic professionals will likely be curtailed as curricu-
lum is shaped and defined by forces outside of the collegial
process. On the other hand, the same kind of reputational
economy that continues to support the market power of schol-
arly publishers may also limit the market fortunes of "digital
diploma mills" and therefore afford some protection to the
traditional model of higher education.
Despite their differences, each of the cases of academic
unbundling discussed above raises important and instructive
challenges for governance of the academic commons at a
time when its social functions and economic foundations are
more subject to political contestation and market-based
reform than ever before. Indeed, it is clear that the nature of
this contestation has not only invited new kinds of interven-
tion by policymakers and regulators but also new opportuni-
ties to boost the role of commercial provision and
marketization in the academic sphere.

Notes
1. From a different angle, Kennan and Cole (2008) characterize
open access institutional repositories as disruptive innovations.
2. The sheer increase in article usage may not be a case of "more
is better." Indeed, it has been found that some researchers
associate volume increases as adding to the burden of filtering
and a tendency to read more superficially (Borrego, Anglada,
Barrios, & Garcia, 2012).
3. In particular, Kapeller (2010) has found that orthodox eco-
nomics journals tend to cite other orthodox journals almost
exclusively, while heterodox journals cite orthodox and het-
erodox journals almost in equal measure. This is due to the fact
that impact factors and citation indexes create an incentive to
cite the most influential or mainstream authors. Another well-
known problem is that challenges to orthodoxy are not prop-
erly captured by citation measures as all citations, even those
that are critical, count as votes in favor of the article or author
being cited.
4. Indeed, one study of disruption predicts that unbundling will
mean that increasing amounts of research will be conducted by
private think tanks (Barber, Donnelly, & Rizvi, 2013).
5. The 2012 Harkin commission report in the U.S. congress
found that these kinds of pressures have already had an impact
Wellen 13
on the for-profit higher education sector and may be respon-
sible for quality deficits and a lax accreditation system.
6. The terms of participation and the locus of authority over cur-
riculum has not yet been outlined.
