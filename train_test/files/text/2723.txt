Background. Studies of liver donors' psychosocial outcomes focus on the short term and rely largely on quality-of-life mea-
sures not specific to donation. We sought to examine long-term donation effects on 3 psychosocial domains: perceived physical,
emotional, and socioeconomic outcomes. Methods. Individuals donating 3 to 10 years previously at 9 centers were eligible for
telephone surveys. Survey responses were examined descriptively. Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct donor groups
based on response profiles across psychosocial domains. Potential predictors of response profiles were evaluated with regression
analysis. Results. Five hundred seventeen donors (66%) participated (M = 5.8 years postdonation, SD = 1.9). Fifteen percent to
48% of donors endorsed current donation-related physical health problems and concerns, and 7%-60% reported socioeconomic
concerns (eg, insurance difficulties, financial expenditures). However, on average, donors experienced high psychological growth,
and 90% felt positively about donation. Cluster analysis revealed 5 donor groups. One group showed high psychological benefit,
with little endorsement of physical or socioeconomic concerns (15% of donors). Four groups showed less favorable profiles, with
varying combinations of difficulties. The largest such group showed high endorsement of physical concerns and financial expen-
ditures, and only modest psychological benefit (31% of donors). Men and nonHispanic whites were most likely to have unfavorable
response profiles (Ps < 0.01). Compared with donors aged 19 to 30 years, older donors were less likely to have unfavorable pro-
files; these differences were significant for donors in the >40 to 50 year age group (Ps < 0.008). Conclusions. Even many years
postdonation, donors report adverse physical and socioeconomic effects, but positive emotional effects as well. Identification of
response profiles and predictors may improve targeting of postdonation surveillance and care.

The protection of living donors' well-being and the pre-
vention of negative consequences of donation are among
the highest priorities in transplantation.1-5 Well-being extends
beyond medical outcomes to encompass psychosocial out-
comes, including perceived physical symptoms, emotional
well-being, socioeconomic concerns, and general (nondonation-
specific) health-related quality of life (HRQOL).1,4,6-12 More-
over, there is increasing recognition that it is insufficient to
consider these outcomes in only the first few years post-
donation; donors require long-term follow-up to identify any
late-term sequelae.5,6,10,11 One of the foremost goals of the
Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort
Study (A2ALL) was to collect long-term data to provide critical
information to donors and transplant programs and to inform
the development of interventions to optimize donor outcomes.
To date, the literature on liver donors' psychosocial out-
comes pertains almost exclusively to the first several years
postdonation.6,8,11-23 This literature has relied on generic,
nondonation-specific, HRQOL assessments (eg, Short-
Form-36 [SF-36]), with findings indicating that donors'
well-being, on average, meets or exceeds that of the general
population.6-8,12,14-16,18-21 Additionally, donors almost uni-
formly express no regret about donation and report deep
gratification at helping another person.15,17,19,23 Neverthe-
less, some single-center studies suggest that significant per-
centages of liver donors experience psychosocial difficulties
postdonation. For example, up to 33% of donors report
poorer health postdonation,15-17 up to 50% worry about last-
ing health effects,24,25 and over 25% have financial hardships,
with prominent concerns about current and future insurance
status.16,19,26 Whether these problems persist, worsen, or re-
solve after the first few years postdonation is largely unknown.
In addition, the elevated rates of these problems are reported
in the same literature--and sometimes within the same
study--that also reports that liver donors' generic HRQOL
meets or exceeds that of the general population.6,12,20,27,28
This suggests that generic measures may be insensitive for living
donors and should be used primarily as adjuncts to more sensi-
tive, specific assessment of donors' potential problems.6,12,29,30
Evidence beyond the first few years postdonation is scarce.
Within A2ALL, data from donors enrolled during the early
years of the project (A2ALL-1, 2004-2009) showed that, on
average, generic HRQOL assessed with the SF-36 exceeds
normative levels, even many years postdonation.31 Although
A2ALL-1 included donors who were up to 11 years post-
donation, sample attrition was relatively high beyond 1 to
3 years postdonation. A small single-center US study,32 and a
large single-center study in Japan reported similar findings of
high SF-36 scores in donors with a median or mean, respec-
tively, of approximately 7 years postdonation.32,33 These re-
ports did not examine in detail donor concerns about the
impact of donation on their physical, emotional, or socio-
economic well-being.
In the present study, we surveyed liver donors who do-
nated 3 to 10 years previously at centers participating in
A2ALL-2 (2009-2014). We assessed psychosocial outcomes
in 3 domains: perceived physical health and symptoms re-
lated to donation, emotional well-being and response to do-
nation, and socioeconomic concerns arising from donation.
The survey also assessed generic HRQOL. Key goals were
not only to provide descriptive information regarding these
outcomes from a large multicenter cohort but also to exam-
ine whether demographic factors, donation-related clinical
factors (eg, surgical complications), and time since donation
predicted psychosocial and HRQOL outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The A2ALL-2 consortium consists of 9 US and Canadian
transplant centers (see Acknowledgements). Six centers had
participated in A2ALL-1. Three new centers joined the
consortium in 2009. The present cross-sectional long-term
follow-up survey was conducted with donors from all 9 cen-
ters. All centers followed the medical/psychosocial evaluation
and exclusion criteria for living donor selection in current US
national policy.3 (Although the policy was enacted after
study participants donated, center members led and partici-
pated in writing the policy, which relied on their experience
already applying those criteria.)
Respondents
Eligible donors were aged 18 years or older, spoke English,
and were 3 to 10 years postdonation (ie, donation occurred
between 2002 and 2009). The 3-year minimum was selected
given our focus on long-term psychosocial outcomes. We set
an upper limit of 10 years because individuals donating be-
fore 2002 did so during an era when many of the centers were
developing their expertise in living liver donor surgery. Thus,
these early donors' experiences and psychosocial outcomes
may differ from more recent donors.

previously established enrolled cohorts of their donors, all do-
nors donating between 2002 and 2009 were telephoned by
their center's study coordinator to obtain informed consent.
At the 3 centers new to the A2ALL consortium, all individuals
donating between 2002 and 2009 were sent a letter describing
the study and allowing them to opt out of it. If they did not opt
out, they were called to obtain consent.
At all centers, donors not reached by telephone (after at
least 3 attempts) were sent a letter describing the study. Coor-
dinators used internet-based search strategies developed by
the survey team (M.A.D., A.F.D., Z.B.) to obtain updated
contact information as needed.
If donors consented, their contact information was for-
warded to the survey team, who assigned trained inter-
viewers to complete the 30- to 45-minute assessments using
computer-assisted telephone interview methods.34,35 The
computer-assisted telephone interview approach ensures that
interviewers use consistent wording, and it minimizes miss-
ing data because a response (or reason for no response) is re-
quired before additional items are asked.35
Trained study personnel at each center reviewed donors'
medical records for clinical information, as described below.
Measures
We assessed donation-specific psychosocial variables in 3
domains, plus general HRQOL. Measures are fully described
in Table S1 (SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B251). We selected
published measures that have been used in prior living donor
studies and, for multi-item rating scales, have established psycho-
metric properties (described in sources cited with each measure).
With regard to perceived physical health symptoms and con-
cerns, donors completed the 10 abdominal symptom items from
the Checklist of Donation-Related Physical Symptoms (focused
on the past month).13,23,36 Donors answered 2 additional items
about whether they had donation-related medical problems
and whether they could not perform some physical activities
as well as before donation.36-38 For each item, they described
any problems/limitations. We also used 4 items assessing cur-
rent and future donation-related health worries.37-40
In the domain of emotional well-being and adjustment, do-
nors completed the 10-item Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-
Short Form41 to assess whether they experienced positive life
changes (eg, learned more about personal strengths) due to
their donation. They completed the 10-item Better Person
Scale,37 assessing feelings of being a better person for having
donated. Donors answered 2 individual items assessing psy-
chological reactions to donation37: whether they would now
make the same decision to donate, and what their overall
feelings were about their donation. Finally, if donors knew
that their recipient was deceased, they rated how guilty or re-
sponsible they felt for the death.37
For socioeconomic concerns, we used items modeled after
those used in other samples.38,42 Donors were asked whether
they had incurred unreimbursed donation-related medical
and nonmedical costs, whether donation-related financial
costs had been burdensome, whether they had changed jobs
due to the donation, and whether their personal income
had been permanently affected by donation. Finally, they re-
ported whether they had problems since donation in either
keeping or getting new health insurance and/or life insurance.
Respondents' generic HRQOL, not specific to dona-
tion, was assessed with the SF-36, version 2.43,44 It assesses
8 domains (general health, physical functioning, vitality,
bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health, role lim-
itations due to emotional health, social functioning, and
mental health). It also yields 2 summary measures (physical
and mental component scores).
Demographics, including relationship to the recipient and
recipient vital status, were obtained during survey interviews.
Medical records data were retrieved on donor body mass
index at evaluation, donation date, length of postsurgical
hospitalization, and medical complications and related re-
hospitalizations during the first year postdonation.
Analyses
We used descriptive statistics to examine demographic and
clinical characteristics, and responses to donation-specific
and generic HRQOL measures. Demographic comparisons
between survey respondents and nonrespondents were made
using t tests and 2 tests. Donors' SF-36 scores were compared
with (a) general population norms using 1-sample t tests; and
(b) a healthy reference group, namely a middle-aged cohort
with no self-reported chronic diseases from the National
Health Measurement Study cohort,45,46 using 2-sample t tests.
Because we acquired a wide array of donation-specific
measures, we performed a multivariable descriptive analysis
across these measures to determine whether donors could
be categorized into discrete groups that each showed a
unique profile or pattern of outcomes that donors attributed
to donation. For this purpose, we used hierarchical agglom-
erative cluster analysis.47,48 (Items asked only if recipients
were deceased were not included because few donors were
asked these items; SF-36 measures were not included because
they did not pertain to donation-specific perceptions.)
Cluster analysis sorts individuals into groups, each with
members similar to each other but different from members
of other groups. We employed the widely used unweighted
pair-group method, with arithmetic averages and squared
Euclidean distance coefficients.47 Standard criteria were ap-
plied (based on amalgamation coefficient change as clustering
proceeded) to judge when the optimal number of clusters was
reached. Standard cross-validation techniques were applied
to determine whether the cluster solution was stable and,
hence, likely to be generalizable.47,48 Thus, the sample was di-
vided randomly in half, and the cluster solution obtained in
1 subsample was compared with that in the other subsample
to determine whether the same clusters were identified.
We evaluated potential demographic and clinical predic-
tors of: (a) donation-specific response profile (ie, cluster
group membership), (b) donor response to recipient death,
and (c) generic HRQOL (composite summary scores). For
each outcome, logistic regression models were fit, and the fi-
nal, most parsimonious model was selected using best subset
selection.49 Before regression analyses, we determined that
model assumptions were met.50 Missing data on the predic-
tors were imputed using IVEware.51 The extent of missing
data is noted in Table 1 (footnote a).

729 donors who were located.
Table 1 displays demographic and clinical characteristics
for respondents and--when available--for nonrespondents.
Respondents were relatively evenly split by sex, aged 19 to
61 years at donation, predominantly nonHispanic whites,
and educated beyond high school. A majority were first-
degree relatives or spouses of recipients. The donation hospi-
talization was generally about 1 week. A majority of donors
experienced no complications or related rehospitalizations
during the first year postdonation. At survey, donors aver-
aged almost 6 years postdonation.
Compared with nonrespondents, respondents were older
and more likely to be nonHispanic whites. Years since
donation and regional location of donors' centers differed
significantly between groups, but the differences were rela-
tively small. There were no significant differences for sex or
relationship to the transplant recipient.

Outcomes and HRQOL

respondents did not return to their centers for follow-up care through the complete first year postdonation. Although the 3 centers new to A2ALL (see Methods section for description of study design) were more
likely to report missing data on postoperative complications and readmissions, there was no statistically significant association of donor center (comparing the 3 new to 6 continuing centers) with either com-
plications (exact P = 0.280) or readmissions (exact P = 0.471).

the surgical site (69% of donors), decreased stomach tone
(50%), low back pain (36%), and itching around the surgical
site (33%).
Table 2 shows that 15% of donors reported current
donation-related medical problems. The most common prob-
lems were hernias (described by 22% [n = 17] of 78 donors
reporting current problems), gastrointestinal/digestive issues
(nausea, fat and food intolerances, 22% [17/78]), chronic
diarrhea (10% [8/78]), and problems with scar tissue and
adhesions (9% [7/78]).
Twenty-two percent of donors reported that they could
not do some physical activities as well as before donation
(Table 2). Donors' descriptions of these limitations pertained
primarily to abdominal exercises or activities requiring
abdominal strength (noted by 47% [n = 52] of the 111 do-
nors reporting current limitations), vigorous physical activity
(21% [23/111]), and lifting significant weight at work or in
sports (19% [21/111]).
Finally, 17% to 31% of donors reported health worries
due to donation, with concern about future health being
most frequently endorsed (Table 2). Overall, 48% endorsed
worry on at least 1 of these items.
Concerning emotional outcomes of donation, donors' av-
erage posttraumatic growth level, and Better Person Scale
scores were at approximately the scales' midpoints. Over
90% of donors stated that they would make the same deci-
sion to donate again, and most had positive overall feel-
ings about donating. Among 91 donors reporting that their

bility for the death were endorsed.
Within the socioeconomic domain, up to 58% of donors
had donation-related financial expenditures, and 15% re-
ported that the expenses were burdensome. Some donors re-
ported having had to change jobs, and some had permanent
income reductions due to donation. Overall, 11% experi-
enced health and/or life insurance problems due to donation.
Generic HRQOL
Table 3 shows mean SF-36 subscale and summary scores.
Relative to US population norms (M = 50, SD = 10), do-
nors reported significantly better HRQOL on all measures
(Ps < .001). Relative to a middle-aged national cohort with
no self-reported chronic diseases (National Health Measure-
ment Study),45,46 donors were similar or better on most phys-
ical HRQOL measures (with the exception of bodily pain)
and similar or worse on emotional HRQOL measures. How-
ever, in all cases, there were small between-group absolute
differences of a few scale points or less (minimal clinically im-
portant difference, 5 points, ie, 0.5 SD from normative
mean55). Using this clinically significant cut point (0.5 SD
from the US normative mean),55 we also classified donor
HRQOL scores as poor (>5 points below the normative
mean), average (within 5 points), or superior (>5 points
above the normative mean). Most donors had at least aver-
age scores (Table 3). However, 7.5% to 15.9% of donors
showed poor scores, with the greatest percentage of poor
scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS).
Group Profiles Across Donation-Specific
Psychosocial Measures
The cluster analysis examined whether donors could be cat-
egorized into discrete groups, each showing a unique profile of
outcomes attributed to donation. The analysis included all
donation-specific measures with sufficient variability (ie, items
on which >90% of donors' answers fell into 1 response cate-
gory were excluded). A 5-cluster solution was obtained. These
clusters are shown in Table 4, along with responses from do-
nors in each cluster group to the psychosocial measures. To
facilitate interpretation, within each row of the table, a super-
script c indicates the group with the highest score or percent-
age; a superscript d indicates the group with the lowest score
or percentage. The test statistics (rightmost column, Table 4)
indicate variables on which the groups significantly differ;
these characteristics were most influential in the analysis.
Cluster group 1 consists of 74 donors showing the highest
psychological benefit from donation and generally low phys-
ical and socioeconomic concerns (first column, Table 4):
they had the highest mean emotional well-being scores (su-
perscript c), the lowest percentage of members with current
donation-related medical problems, and the lowest percent-
age who incurred donation-related costs (superscript d).
They also had relatively low percentages of other physical
and socioeconomic problems. In contrast, group 5 includes
57 donors with the lowest psychological benefit, plus at least
some physical and socioeconomic concerns: they had low
mean emotional well-being scores, they had some physical
symptoms and concerns (although these were not as promi-
nent as for some other groups), and they were most likely to
report burdensome donation costs and insurance difficulties.
The labels describing each of the remaining 3 groups sim-
ilarly characterize their distinctive profiles of benefits and
concerns. Of these groups, group 3 (n = 158 donors) had
the highest physical concerns. They were the most likely to
have physical symptoms and problems and to have incurred
donation-related financial expenses. They had relatively
modest psychological benefit. Finally, group 2 (n = 109)
showed a profile of relatively high psychological benefit
(mean scores approached those for the highest psychological

a In a 2006 national sample of the noninstitutionalized US population aged 35-89 years (n = 3522)46 who completed telephone assessments of HRQOL, we selected all persons with the same upper age limit and
same BMI range as in the living donor sample, and excluded all persons with any of 11 self-reported chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, eye disease, sleep disorder, respiratory
disease, depression, ulcer, thyroid disease, back pain).
b Scores were transformed to have a mean of 50 and an SD of 10 in the general population (ie, norm-based scoring43). Higher scores indicate better HRQOL for all measures. All mean scores for the sample are
significantly higher than SF-36 version 2 norms for the US general population (1-sample t tests, all P values < 0.001). We used norm-based scoring in these analyses because it enables more accurate under-
standing of relative differences between subscale scores, eg, whether scores on a given subscale are truly more favorable than scores on another subscales.43 Norm-based scoring is recommended by the scale
designers.43 Because some studies of living donor HRQOL report 0 to 100 scoring rather than norm-based scoring, Table S2 (SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B251) provides donors' scores computed with 0 to
100 scoring to allow comparison to other published living donor cohorts.

benefit group), with a mixed pattern of physical and socio-
economic concerns. Group 4 (n = 109) showed relatively
lower psychological benefit, but they also had relatively low
physical and socioeconomic concerns.
Cross-validation analyses replicated the pattern of clusters
found in the complete sample: a 5-cluster solution was opti-
mal in each replication; 77% of donors in 1 subsample and
74% in the second subsample were classified into the same
cluster as in the full sample. This provides strong evidence
for cluster stability.47,48
Predictors of Donation-Specific Response
Profiles, Donor Reaction to Recipient Death,
and Poor Generic HRQOL
Regression analysis results are shown in Table 5. Signifi-
cant predictors of membership in the 5 response profiles
(cluster groups) include sex, race/ethnicity, and age at dona-
tion. Using the most favorable profile group as the referent
(group 1: high psychological benefit/mostly low physical
and socioeconomic concerns), men were 2.45 to 6.23 times
more likely to fall into other (less favorable) profile groups.
Men were at highest risk (odds ratio, 6.23) of falling into
the group with the lowest psychological benefit. Non-
Hispanic whites were also more likely to fall into the less fa-
vorable profile groups. They showed the highest odds of fall-
ing into the group with the highest physical concerns (group
3: odds ratio, 7.61). Finally, compared with donors aged 19
to 30 years, all older age groups were at reduced risk of fall-
ing into the less favorable profile groups; this risk reduction
relative to the youngest (referent) group was largest and sta-
tistically significant for donors in the >40 to 50 year age
group. No other significant demographic or clinical predic-
tors emerged, even in sensitivity analyses that further exam-
ined individual center effects and effects linked to donor
relationship to recipient (Table 5, footnote a).
To examine predictors of donor reaction to recipient
death, we created a composite outcome reflecting whether
any feelings of guilt or responsibility were endorsed (ie,
donors scored >1 on either scale) because the original vari-
ables were extremely skewed. Regression results indicated
that greater time since donation was associated with reduced
risk of such feelings (Table 5). No other significant predictors
emerged.
The final regression examined predictors of poor SF-36
MCS scores. (The Physical Component Summary was not
considered because >90% of the sample scored in the average
to superior range.) One predictor emerged: a longer hospital
stay postdonation significantly increased the likelihood of a
poor MCS score (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Ours is the first study to consider both a range of psy-
chosocial outcomes that living liver donors attributed to do-
nation, as well as generic HRQOL in the long-term years
after donation. We assembled one of the largest cohorts to
date, and the multicenter study design enhances our findings'
potential generalizability.
Chief among our results is evidence that substantial
percentages of donors report donation-specific concerns,
particularly regarding physical health and socioeconomic
consequences of donation. This is despite the facts that
(a) donors' average, generic HRQOL levels exceed general
population normative levels and (b) are similar to healthy
comparison groups--findings typical in living donor popula-
tions.8,14-16,18-21,24,32,33,56 Thus, even 3 to 10 years post-
donation, 15% to 48% of donors reported current
donation-related medical problems, physical activity lim-
itations, and worries about current and future health.
Although donors may have mistakenly attributed their
medical problems to donation, many problems represent typ-
ical postdonation difficulties (eg, incisional hernias, gastroin-
testinal problems associated with gallbladder removal,57
which accompanies liver donation), suggesting that donors
are indeed experiencing donation-related issues. Similarly,
the physical limitations noted by 22% of donors are consis-
tent with having undergone abdominal surgery. Further-
more, from a socioeconomic perspective, many donors
reported not only personal financial costs arising from dona-
tion, but also, in some cases, job changes, permanent income
reductions, and problems obtaining or keeping health or life
insurance due to donation. These types of experiences may
serve as major disincentives to donation, and the develop-
ment of strategies to mitigate them is paramount to ensure
that living donation remains a viable option for future trans-
plant candidates.58-63
At the same time, however, many donors in our sample
had positive psychological outcomes. Consistent with a large
literature,15,17,19,23,37,64-66 donors overwhelmingly endorsed
positive feelings about the donation and would make the
same decision to donate again. Similar to another recent
study in living kidney and liver donors,67 our sample re-
ported average levels of personal psychological growth
from the experience comparable to those in populations
exposed to other psychologically and/or physically stressful
events.68-73 They were equally or more likely than other types
of donors to feel that they were "better persons" for having
donated.74-76
How can we reconcile or integrate these disparate percep-
tions of donation impact across domains of psychosocial
well-being? Our cluster analysis results suggest an integra-
tion, showing that there are distinct donor groups, identifi-
able based on their response profiles across the multiple
domains. Five different groups emerged. One group showed
very high psychological benefit with low levels of physical
health or socioeconomic concerns. Clearly, this profile is
most desirable, and 15% of donors fell into this group. The
remaining 85% fell into 4 groups, each of which reflected less
than optimal combinations of degree of psychological benefit
versus degrees of physical or socioeconomic concerns. Partic-
ularly noteworthy is the largest single group emerging in the
analysis: donors, who were the most likely to have physical
health concerns in every area assessed, had incurred socio-
economic costs, and showed only modest psychological ben-
efit (31% of the sample).
We believe that the cluster analysis results are clinically sig-
nificant: care providers routinely seek to integrate multiple,
often apparently disparate patient responses into a meaning-
ful whole. In the context of living donation, these providers
are vitally concerned with understanding and predicting the
overall cost-benefit profile a donor is likely to achieve.
Patient-reported outcomes, based on donor perceptions of
the consequences of donation, are critical to understanding
relative costs and benefits. However, previous donor stud-
ies fail to empirically integrate data collected on multiple

very few donors were rehospitalized, and readmissions are included in the Clavien grading of complications. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to explore whether, aside from geographic region where a center was located, there might be individual center differences on the 3
outcomes. No sizable or statistically significant center differences emerged, either when center was considered alone in relation to each outcome variable, or when center was included in the multivariable modeling. Moreover, the inclusion of individual center in the multivariable modeling also
did not change the effects that were identified as statistically significant in the regression models. Similarly, sensitivity analyses were performed to explore whether a finer-grained classification of relationship to recipient (using all categories in Table 1) might reveal associations with the outcomes

patient-reported outcomes. Our findings suggest what may
be typical response profiles across 3 psychosocial dimensions
in liver donors in the long-term postdonation.
Equally critical are our results regarding predictors of
which donors were most likely to fall into certain cluster
groups. Although we considered time since donation plus a
range of demographic and clinical factors assessed either
predonation, perioperatively, or during the first year post-
donation, only 3 demographic characteristics emerged as sig-
nificant risk factors. Thus, men and nonHispanic whites were
more likely to fall into cluster groups with less than optimal
combinations of psychological benefit versus physical and so-
cioeconomic concerns. Older donors (aged >30, particularly
those in the >40 to 50 age group) were at reduced risk of fall-
ing into these groups. Conversely, the donor group with the
highest psychological benefits and generally low physical
and socioeconomic concerns was most likely to consist of
women, racial/ethnic minorities, and older donors--namely
those in the >40 to 50 age group. These results are an impor-
tant addition to the larger literature examining living donors'
psychosocial outcomes: this literature has yielded mixed, con-
tradictory findings concerning whether and the direction in
which demographic factors, such as those we identified, pre-
dict donor psychosocial outcomes6--perhaps because the out-
comes have been considered piecemeal rather than in terms of
complete response profiles. Given our descriptive findings that
important effects exist, future research is needed to explore
why certain demographic groups would be less likely to report
favorable profiles of benefits versus concerns.
In addition to examining psychosocial outcome profiles
across all donors, we examined donor responses concerning
recipient death. We observed very low average levels of per-
ceived guilt or responsibility for the death. In fact, the greater
the time since donation, the less likely donors were to experi-
ence these feelings, regardless of how long it had been since
the death and how soon posttransplant it occurred. We do
not believe this indicates that recipient death fails to affect do-
nors; as we and others have previously found,7,29 donors typ-
ically assert that, while they may experience profound grief,
they take great comfort knowing they did everything possible
to help their recipient.
Our study has important limitations. First, the study was
cross-sectional; we could not examine whether the donors'
psychosocial status or general HRQOL changed from pre-
donation to postdonation. However, our psychosocial out-
comes were donation-specific and could not logically be
assessed predonation, and we also compared general HRQOL
with that of both normative data and a healthy national survey
sample to put our sample in perspective. Second, we studied
adult-to-adult donors from North American centers; general-
izability to pediatric settings and whether our findings con-
cerning, for example, financial issues would generalize to
other geographical regions is unknown. Nevertheless, we
know of no cross-continent comparisons of long-term psycho-
social outcomes. Third, we observed several demographic dif-
ferences between survey responders and nonresponders; this
also may reduce our findings' generalizability. However, our
response rate was higher than that in previous large long-
term HRQOL follow-up studies after liver donation.31,33
Fourth, a considerable time gap existed between the donation
and the survey. Although we have information on factors,
such as complications, during the first year postdonation, a
period during which donors were followed closely by their
centers, our donors' interim psychosocial and medical status
until the point of follow-up is unknown. This precluded us
from examining long-term psychosocial status in relation to
other factors across the entire postdonation period. Fifth,
there are other potentially important risk factors for donor
psychosocial outcomes that we did not assess, including
predonation ambivalence about donating, family social sup-
ports, donor psychiatric status and the development of de-
pressive or anxiety disorders postdonation, and surviving
recipients' well-being.6,7 Finally, we did not assess nondonor
comparison groups to ascertain results unique to our donors.
However, donation-specific outcomes are not relevant to
comparison groups, and we marshalled both normative
and healthy population-level comparative data for our ge-
neric HRQOL assessments.
Despite limitations, our study provides important infor-
mation regarding the range of psychosocial outcomes ob-
served across multiple dimensions in living liver donors
assessed up to 10 years postdonation. The identification of
specific response profiles across dimensions may be useful
clinically: findings that basic, easily assessed demographic
risk factors predict which donors may fall into less favorable
psychosocial outcome profiles may allow for better targeting
of both (a) clinical surveillance and care, and (b) additional
education both predonation and postdonation regarding
donation-related risks and potential health concerns. Specifi-
cally, our findings suggest that men, nonHispanic white do-
nors, and younger donors should be targeted for surveillance
and heightened education. Future work is needed to determine
whether the observed response profiles generalize to other
cohorts, and whether there are other prominent patterns
that we did not uncover. In addition, a richer array of risk
factors, in a cohort followed prospectively, may allow for
identification of additional characteristics that affect the
likelihood of donor psychosocial difficulties in the years
after liver donation and could further inform donor educa-
tion and clinical care.
