Article
After decades of investigation, the construct of rapport
remains a nebulous one, still evoking the image of "cornmeal
mush" (DePaulo & Bell, 1990, p. 305). In particular, the non-
verbal behavior indicative of rapport remains ill-defined and
inconsistent (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Although researchers
have already isolated rapport into three, interrelated compo-
nents--mutual attentiveness, positivity, and behavioral coor-
dination (Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1990)--those
components do not always generate or signal rapport
(DePaulo & Bell, 1990; Patterson, 1990). Not only are these
components observed in distinctly low-rapport circum-
stances (Cappella, 1996; DePaulo & Bell, 1990), but the
ways in which they correlate with rapport seem to vary
across contexts (Tickle-Degnen, 2006).
Continued work is thus needed to clarify the relationship
between rapport and its behavioral correlates. Recognizing
this need, Tickle-Degnen (2006) cited the optimal experi-
ence model of flow theory (Csíkszentmihályi, 1990;
Csíkszentmihályi & LeFevre, 1989) as relevant to a more
theoretically cogent examination of rapport. In this model,
Csíkszentmihályi (1990) originally proposed that a person is
most likely to experience "flow" when a task is moderately
difficult. If a person finds the task too easy or too challeng-
ing, suboptimal experiences result. Tickle-Degnen (2006)
conceptualized rapport, like flow, as a kind of optimal expe-
rience. As such, she theorized that rapport and its behavioral
correlates could similarly fit into an optimal experience
model, where moderate (i.e., "optimal") levels of behavior
would be indicative of high dyadic rapport.
The current study furthers Tickle-Degnen's work by
empirically evaluating her published model. Specifically, we
examined the relationship between rapport and two of its
behavioral correlates--namely, nonverbal expressivity and
coordination--during dyadic interactions. Ultimately, empir-
ically evaluating Tickle-Degnen's (2006) optimal experience
model may be a crucial first step in distinguishing the "some-
thing more" (DePaulo & Bell, 1990, p. 305) that character-
izes the rapport construct.
Dyadic Rapport as Affect and Action
To begin, a two-component conceptualization of dyadic rap-
port--one that couples affect with behavior--is most relevant
to our analysis. Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal's (1990) three-
component model of rapport classically recognized its affective

Interacting in Flow: An Analysis of
Rapport-Based Behavior as Optimal
Experience
Andrew A. Nelson1, Jon E. Grahe2, and Fabian Ramseyer3
Abstract
Theorists have long noted the nebulousness of dyadic rapport and its nonverbal correlates. In response to Tickle-Degnen's
call for a more theoretically complete analysis of the rapport construct, we empirically evaluated her adaptation of
Csíkszentmihályi's optimal experience model with the hope of better conceptualizing rapport's behavioral manifestations.
Dyads (N
dyad
= 50) engaged in two interdependent tasks and completed a battery of post-task measures gauging their mood
and experiences of rapport. To complement self-report measures, we coded rapport-based behavior using both subjective
(thin-slice judgments) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis) methodologies. According to Tickle-Degnen's model, dyadic
exchanges with moderate levels of expressivity and interpersonal coordination should yield the highest levels of rapport.
Although data from our objective coding did not trend in this manner, subjective measurements of coordinated expressivity
matched the paradigm's prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically support Tickle-Degnen's hypothesis
and a novel step toward clarifying the rapport construct.

and behavioral nature: Feelings of positivity are characterized
by displays of affectionate touch, forward leaning, smiling, and
other affectionate gestures (Anderson, Guerrero, & Jones,
2006; Hendrick, 1990); mutual attention is conveyed through
eye contact and posture sharing (Norton & Pettegrew, 1979);
and sensations of "balance" or "harmony" (Tickle-Degnen &
Rosenthal, 1990) manifest through coordinated movement
between partners. Indeed, to understand rapport as affect alone
is to overlook how it is established, built, and maintained.
In fact, various dual-system models--including Patterson's
(1995) parallel process model, Chartrand and Bargh's (1999)
perception-action system, and Tickle-Degnen's (2006) signal­
perception­action­signal loop--suggest a link between
dyadic action and social perception. Behavioral coordination
during a dyadic interaction elicits shared perceptions between
interactants (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), and more generally,
nonverbal signaling works to convey information between an
actor and a perceiver (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Thus, dyadic
action is intrinsic to the formation and maintenance of rapport,
as it creates a bidirectional expressway for information sharing
and rapport development (Dijksterhuis & Bargh, 2001; Grahe
& Bernieri, 1999; Tickle-Degnen, 2006).
Nonverbal Expressivity as the
Groundwork of Interpersonal Behavior
This dyadic action can be fundamentally understood as non-
verbal expressivity, which refers to the clarity by which an
individual nonverbally communicates his or her emotions
(Boone & Buck, 2003). Expressivity requires "expressive-
ness," which more generally refers to the behavioral activity
used to convey an affective state. Tickle-Degnen (2006)
asserts that such activity is integral to dyadic rapport devel-
opment. Expressiveness allows for the communication of
emotions and attitudes from an actor to a perceiver, and in
turn, the perceiver possesses more information from which
to reciprocate appropriately and build rapport.
Much research concludes that the nonverbal expression of
emotion remains a crucial ingredient in dyadic interactions.
Expressivity is positively associated with ratings of relational
quality and rapport (Fridlund & Russell, 2006; Grahe &
Bernieri, 2002; Riggio & Riggio, 2002). Furthermore, related
studies have even experimentally suppressed participants'
capacity for expressivity. Butler and colleagues (2003; Butler,
Lee, & Gross, 2007) discovered that directing dyad members
to restrain their nonverbal behavior led to negative perceptions
of the interaction. Although the social importance of expres-
sivity may vary across cultures (e.g., Butler et al., 2007), it
does seem to be a critical variable in the rapport equation.
Interpersonal Coordination and
Rapport Development
Theory and research further suggest that the coordination of
nonverbal action is important for rapport development. In fact,
Tickle-Degnen (2006) asserts that expressivity is the "raw
action material" required for coordination (p. 387). Said dif-
ferently, when there is no expressivity during an interaction,
there is no behavior available for coordination. Coordination
can refer to both behavior matching and interactional syn-
chrony (Burgoon, Stern, & Dillman, 1995; Grammer, Kruck,
& Magnusson, 1998). Behavior-matching is the nearly simul-
taneous mirroring of gestures, facial expressions, or other
behaviors between dyad members (Tickle-Degnen, 2006).
Interactional synchrony occurs on a global level, as when
dyads interact with a certain rhythm or smoothness (Bernieri
& Rosenthal, 1991; Tickle-Degnen, 2006).
Evidence at both the behavioral and affective levels sup-
ports coordination's relevance to positive social outcomes,
including rapport (Cappella & Schreiber, 2006). Emotional
contagion or "yoking" represents a good example of affec-
tive coordination (Cappella & Schreiber, 2006; Hatfield,
Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1993), as proximate individuals some-
times synchronize their own moods and emotions to reflect
another's emotional state. At the behavioral level, some sug-
gest that synchrony and posture mimicry might contribute to
this kind of emotional convergence (Hatfield et al., 1993).
Such an explanation makes sense when noting that interac-
tional synchrony is recognized by both observers (Bernieri
et al., 1996; Cappella, 1997; Lakens & Stel, 2011) and inter-
actants (Bernieri et al., 1996; Grahe & Bernieri, 2002; Grahe
& Sherman, 2007; Vacharkulksemsuk & Fredrickson, 2012)
as a characteristic of high-rapport interactions. Humans may
even have an innate preference for synchronized interaction
(Argyle, 1990; Harrist & Waugh, 2002; Tronick, 1989,
1990), suggesting that behavioral coordination is also inte-
gral to establishing and maintaining rapport.
Dyadic Rapport Within the Optimal
Experience Model
Tickle-Degnen (2006) argued that dyadic rapport--in both
its affective and behavioral nature--represents an optimal
experiencesimilartoakindof"flowstate"(Csíkszentmihályi,
1990). An individual enters "flow" when she or he becomes
unconditionally absorbed by a task at hand. While in flow, a
person's anxieties often diminish and a feeling of ease results.
A body of research suggests that individuals are most likely
to enter flow when they engage in an activity with a diffi-
culty that matches their skill level within that domain. If they
participate in a task that is either too difficult or too easy for
their perceived skill level, suboptimal consequences such as
anxiety or boredom can emerge (Csíkszentmihályi, 1990;
Csíkszentmihályi & LeFevre, 1989; Mesurado & Richaud de
Minzi, 2013; Nakamura, 1988). This difficulty/skill balance
wasfirstidentifiedbyNakamura(1988),andCsíkszentmihályi
(1990) later integrated this phenomenon into his optimal
experience theory.
Tickle-Degnen (2006) believed that a similar kind of opti-
mal balance is also pertinent to the rapport ecosystem. She
Nelson et al. 3
reworked optimal experience theory into a model that
extended its relevance to interpersonal behavior patterns dur-
ing rapport development. According to Tickle-Degnen's
(2006) model, optimal experiences are those where dyads
feel and act in calm, yet attentive ways; suboptimal experi-
ences foster overactive or underactive levels of action and
affect (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). More specifically, when an
actor's expressivity is overactive, information is lost between
an actor and a perceiver. When expressivity is underactive,
there is a shortage of nonverbal information passed between
partners. Frantic behavior also makes coordination between
dyad members more challenging, and conversely, a lack of
behavior means that there is less behavior to coordinate.
Hence, moderate levels of expressivity should promote the
most rapport development.
Some research supports this postulation. Boone and Buck
(2003) discovered that especially high levels of expressivity
hindered the formation of trust in unacquainted dyads. They
also concluded that expressivity necessitates a moderate
degree of expressiveness (Boone & Buck, 2003). In addition,
a longitudinal examination of practitioner­client interactions
found that an intermediate--as opposed to high--frequency
of attentive or positive behavior was linked to the most favor-
able rapport ratings (Tickle-Degnen & Gavett, 2003). The
relationship between expressivity and rapport levels could
thus be a nonlinear one, where chaotic (overactive) or sub-
dued (underactive) action yields the lowest rapport because it
disrupts the patterned responsiveness of interactions.
Interpersonal coordination may also behave in a similar way.
When coordination is gauged on a looseness-to-tightness
spectrum (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991; Burgoon et al., 1995),
moderate levels should be most conducive to rapport-building.
Indeed, research validates this relationship between moderate
coordination and more positive interactional outcomes
(Cappella, 1996; Jaffe, Beatrice, Stanley, Crown, & Jasnow,
2001; Tickle-Degnen & Gavett, 2003).
The Current Study
The current study extends this prior work by empirically
evaluating Tickle-Degnen's optimal experience model.
Using a subset of data (Study 2; Nelson, Grahe, Ramseyer, &
Serier, 2014) published in a public data repository, we exam-
ined associations between dyads' sensations of rapport and
their displays of expressivity/coordination across two inter-
dependent tasks. In addition, research assistants coded all the
nonverbal behavior present in these dyadic interaction using
both subjective (thin-slice judgments; Ambady & Rosenthal,
1992) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis [MEA];
Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2006, 2011) methodologies. Thus,
the resulting data span multiple modes of analysis. Tickle-
Degnen's model suggests that dyadic exchanges with moder-
ate or "optimal" levels of expressivity and coordination
should be associated with the highest sensations of rapport.
As such, we hypothesized that this pattern would arise in our
data, and we further anticipated that it would be supported
across both subjective and objective coding.
Method
Protocol/Data History
The data in question were first collected in response to a pro-
posal submitted to an undergraduate research initiative
(Collective Undergraduate Research Project; Grahe, 2010).
In the fall of 2011, Dr. Fabian Ramseyer (e.g., Ramseyer &
Horowitz, 2010) shared a collection of materials and proce-
dural information with this research initiative. His proposal
outlined a methodological replication of Ramseyer and
Horowitz (2010) that would further investigate the nature of
behavioral synchrony during cooperative interactions. Since
his submission, several student teams have conducted con-
ceptual replications of this design while also including novel
manipulations of their own. A copy of this base protocol is
shared on our Open Science Framework (OSF) project page
(https://osf.io/bn3th/wiki/home/), as are PDF copies of both
pre-task (https://osf.io/76rt9/) and post-task (https://osf.io/
b8agm/) questionnaires. The resulting data have also been
made publicly available via the Journal of Open Psychology
Data (Nelson, Grahe, & Ramseyer, 2014).
The current study is one such extension from this base
protocol. As a result, not all employed measures are pertinent
to the present research question, so we only detail those rel-
evant to our optimal experience hypothesis. Those interested
in the full battery of measures may visit our OSF project
page.
Participants
Undergraduate students (N
dyad
= 50) from a small, liberal arts
university in the Pacific Northwest region of the United
States enrolled in this study. Dropout tendencies and univer-
sity demographics contributed to an imbalanced number of
participants across the different dyad makeup conditions;
specifically, we tested more female­female pairings (n = 27)
than male­male (n = 10) and mixed-sex dyads (n = 13). Due
to the relatively small student population of the university,
researchers accounted for possible familiarity between par-
ticipants by using two self-report questions. We treated all
participants according to APA ethical guidelines.
Procedure
To assign a task order to each dyad, we generated a list of
randomized numbers where each value corresponded to a
given task sequence. According to this randomization proce-
dure, 28 dyads were assigned a menu task first, whereas 22
dyads were assigned a close-calls task first. Participants
entered the lab upon arrival and chose which side of the table
to sit on; thereafter, participants could not switch their
4 SAGE Open
seating arrangements. After reviewing informed consent and
video consent forms, participants turned to the nearby com-
puters and completed pre-task assessments while the
researcher remained in the room. Upon completion, we again
asked participants to sit at the central table. An experimenter
then read one of the two dyadic task prompts aloud, answer-
ing any questions accordingly. Afterward, the experimenter
turned on a video camera and began a stopwatch before leav-
ing the room. Following the 6-min task, participants returned
to their separate computers and answered the posttest mea-
sures. Researchers repeated these procedures (excluding the
initial pretest) for the second of the two dyadic tasks.
Materials
Pre-task measures. Prior to their first dyadic interaction, par-
ticipants completed a battery of personality measures.
Interpersonal difficulties. We used the short-form Inventory
of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32; Horowitz, Alden, Wig-
gins, & Pincus, 2000), a 32-item measure of interpersonal
behavior in which participants rate how much certain social
problems affect them (e.g., "It is hard for me to socialize with
other people"). Ratings were made on a 5-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Because
we did not have any hypotheses specific to the eight IIP sub-
scales (i.e., Domineering, Vindictive, Cold, Socially Inhib-
ited, Nonassertive, Overly Accommodating, Self-sacrificing,
Intrusive), we computed a mean score of interpersonal dif-
ficulties across the full 32 items ( = .84).
Empathy. Next, we used a modified version of the Inter-
personal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980) to assess par-
ticipants' levels of empathy. Specifically, we retained three
of the original four IRI subscales, which allowed us to mea-
sure empathetic concern (e.g., "I am often quite touched by
things I see happen"), perspective taking (e.g., "I try to look
at everyone's side of a disagreement before I make a deci-
sion"), and fantasy ("After seeing a play or a movie, I have
felt as though I were one of the characters"). Answers ranged
on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (does not describe me
well) to 5 (describes me very well). Again, we compiled all
items into a single empathy construct, yielding a mean empa-
thy score for each participant ( = .86).
Dyadic tasks.In accordance with Ramseyer's proposal,
researchers used both a dyadic "menu task" and a "close
calls" experience (adapted from Chovil, 1991) as opportuni-
ties for rapport-building. Beginning with the former, the
menu task asked participants to create an imaginary five-
course dinner menu comprised of foods they both disliked.
The task was entirely verbal, so participants did not create
hard copies of their agreed-upon menu. In the "close calls"
prompt, researchers instructed each member of the dyad to
disclose past "near-miss" or potentially dangerous situations
that they had either experienced themselves or heard about
from peers. Dyads had 6 min to complete each task, and we
did not predict outcomes to differ across the tasks. For com-
plete copies of these prompts (Interactions 1 and 2), see our
OSF page (https://osf.io/a6kis/).
Interactant familiarity. We did assess the extent to which each
dyad member might know his or her partner. Specifically,
participants reported how long they had known their partner
on a Likert-type scale from 1 (we've not known each other
before) to 6 (for more than 3 years). They also reported how
well they knew their partner on a Likert-type scale from 1
(first time I've seen him or her) to 6 (we are close friends).
Post-task measures.After each task, both participants com-
pleted a battery of measures related to the preceding
interaction.
Interpersonal closeness.We used the Inclusion of Others in
Self (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992) pictorial-based measure
to gauge perceptions of interpersonal closeness between inter-
actants. By using a series of inter-lapping circles to represent
different levels of "closeness," this measure instructed partici-
pants to choose the set of circles that "best describes their rela-
tionship." Participants responded on a scale from 1 (no overlap
between the circles) to 9 (nearly complete overlap of the cir-
cles), with higher levels of overlap designating more closeness.
Mood. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS;
Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) asked participants to recall
the degree to which they encountered certain moods (for
instance, feeling "interested" or "hostile") during the preced-
ing interaction ( = .89). Answers ranged on a Likert-type
scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with higher scores
indicating more positive moods.
Rapport. We used the Post-Interaction/Rapport Question-
naire (IRQ; Bernieri, Davis, Rosenthal, & Knee, 1994) as
our primary gauge of dyadic rapport during each interac-
tion. This measure asked participants to rate the presence of
certain rapport-based characteristics during the preceding
task ( = .95). Participants rated their experience based on
18 different qualifiers (e.g., "coordination" or "intensity"),
answering on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all)
to 9 (extremely).
Behavioral Coding
We assessed displays of interpersonal behavior during each
dyadic interaction using both subjective (i.e., thin-slice cod-
ing) and objective (i.e., MEA) methodologies. We provide an
overview of both methodologies below.
Thin-slice coding.The behavioral cues present during interper-
sonal exchanges exist on objective and subjective levels (Grahe
Nelson et al. 5
& Bernieri, 2002). Objective cues consist of quantifiable
actions determined by time (for example, the duration of eye
contact between interactants) or quantity (the number of smiles
made by each of them). In contrast, subjective cues require the
observer to speculate about an actor's or dyad's psychological
state. Even so, such speculation is often derived from objective
behavior, as when a friend makes inferences about a couple's
rapport based on concrete instances of smiling and touch.
Based on these cues, humans intuitively make judgments
about interactions and their outcomes (Ambady, 2010;
DePaulo & Friedman, 1998). Research consistently finds
observer judgments to be accurate and in line with interac-
tants' own perceptions of an interaction (e.g., Ambady &
Rosenthal, 1992). Moreover, quick judgments of interper-
sonal behavior--even when made at random times during an
interaction--are no less accurate than longer judgments
(Ambady, Bernieri, & Richeson, 2000;Ambady & Rosenthal,
1992). These so-called "thin-slice" judgments, operationally
understood as impressions formed after 5 min or less, are reli-
able across contexts (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). In some
cases, these thin-slice judgments are even more accurate than
those made after a longer period of time (Patterson &
Stockbridge, 1998).Accordingly, we isolated 30-s slices from
each videotaped interaction for our coding purposes. To
reduce the risk of sampling artifact and potential bias, experi-
menters selected the first 30 s from the second minute of each
interaction for coding purposes.
Three research assistants unaware of study hypotheses
then coded each selection. Before coding began, these coders
attended multiple training sessions held by the second author,
and during each session, they practiced using a coding
scheme specifically created for the purposes of this study
(see the appendix). Notably, our coding scheme focused on
the primary behavioral correlates of rapport as noted by
Tickle-Degnen (2006), and the scheme used language
directly taken from her optimal experience model. Overall,
ratings were made on a 7-point Likert-type scale. A centered
"0" value represented optimal experience, and each pole of
the scale ("-3" on one side and "+3" on the other) repre-
sented the extremes of suboptimal experience.
In particular, coders used this scale to assess behavioral
displays of "Activity/Expressivity" and "Coordination/
Synchrony." Activity/Expressivity is the "raw behavioral
material" necessary for the development of interpersonal
coordination (Tickle-Degnen, 2006, p. 385). During subopti-
mal interactions, interactants can feel "bored" or "anxious,"
and their expressivity reflects these feelings; when interac-
tants are engaged in an optimal experience, however, they
demonstrate "calm and energized" action (Tickle-Degnen,
2006). We used these same characterizations of suboptimal
and optimal expressivity in our own coding scheme (see the
appendix). Based on this scheme, coders rated the Activity/
Expressivity of each dyad member separately, and these
scores were averaged to yield a single Activity/Expressivity
score for each dyad.
We also borrowed Tickle-Degnen's (2006) conceptualiza-
tion of suboptimal and optimal coordination for our coding
scheme. Coordination/Synchrony referred to how harmoni-
ous or in sync the dyad appeared while interacting.
Suboptimal coordination was characterized by an "empti-
ness" of behavior at one pole and as "disordered" behavior at
the other pole; smooth, synchronous displays denoted opti-
mal experience (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Because group judg-
ments are often more reliable than single-coder assessments
(Ambady et al., 2000), each coder separately evaluated all of
the interactions for Activity/Expressivity as well as
Coordination/Synchrony. Inter-rater reliability scores sug-
gested consistent coding for both Activity/Expressivity ( =
.93) and Coordination/Synchrony ( = .72) variables.
Motion Energy Analysis. Subjective evaluations of movement,
however, may be confounded by the observer's inability to
separate judgments of synchrony alone from gestalt percep-
tions of rapport-building. In consequence, technological
advancements now allow for more objective techniques of
synchrony measurement that can gauge interpersonal motion
exclusively. Grammer, Honda, Juette, and Schmitt (1999)
first began using automatic movie analysis (AMA) to exam-
ine nonverbal courtship behavior as a way to clarify the
"fuzziness" of interactional movement. AMA reads digitized
video footage of a given interaction. This video footage is
recorded with a completely static camera in front of a stable
background with stable light conditions. Motion energy is
then detected by subtracting the image of one video frame
from the previous frame. The amount of change (i.e., the
frame-difference) serves as a quantifiable indicator of move-
ment. These differences paint a singular, overall picture of
motion across any given amount of time. Not only is the pro-
cess less subjective than manual video-coding, but it is both
efficient and highly reliable (Grammer et al., 1999).
We used a similar program--MEA (Ramseyer, 2016;
Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011)--to objectively evaluate syn-
chronous behavior during each dyadic task. Like AMA, MEA
is based on the frame-differencing method. In frame differ-
encing, pixels from digital videos are converted into their
grayscale format, ranging from 0 (true black) to 255 (true
white). Pixel hue changes between two subsequent video
frames, which are caused by a participant's movement, are
then calculated and conceptualized as motion energy (ME;
Kupper, Ramseyer, Hoffmann, Kalbermatten, & Tschacher,
2010). These calculations of ME are bounded by pre-deter-
mined "maps" or drawn-out regions of a participant's body. In
other words, if near-simultaneous motion is detected in adja-
cent regions (for example, an upper body region) for both
dyad members, it is conceptualized as synchronous move-
ment. Because ME calculations are bounded by these regions,
shared movement does not need to occur between the same
body parts across interactants (e.g., each person's right arm)
to register as synchrony. Furthermore, because MEA algo-
rithm reacts to pixel alterations, only the dynamic aspects of
6 SAGE Open
movement are assessed. Thus, dyadic posture sharing or
"static" synchrony is not evaluated using this technique. For a
comprehensive overview of the MEA technique, we direct
readers to Ramseyer and Tschacher (2011).
In the current study, we isolated our analyses to the upper
body region of each interactant, which extended from their
waist to the top of their head. Although it is theoretically pos-
sible to do more acute analyses, smaller "maps" are prone to
conflation from stray movements from other body parts
(Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2014). In addition, because MEA
maps are static and drawn over the video footage after it is
recorded, body parts (e.g., a head) can easily cross the bound-
aries of smaller maps due to participant movement. Although
we did use specific lower body and head maps, this upper
body region constituted the largest MEA map and the most
reliable area for analysis.
Time series of raw movement quantification from MEA
was then used to compute lagged cross-correlations of upper
body ME between partners. These cross-correlations repre-
sent the degree of covariation of ME across partners.
Because of the non-stationarity of movement behavior,
cross-correlations are calculated in separate windows of
30 s. Each window provides a variety of cross-correlations
between the upper body regions of both partners for different
time lags. Instantaneous (or "zero-lagged") synchrony is rep-
resented by ME changes that occur across the same subse-
quent frames for both partners. However, because synchrony
can also be directional (with one partner leading the move-
ment and the other partner following), the cross-correlations
are shifted in time to also detect synchrony that occurs with
a short time delay (or "lag"). We allowed for lags of up to 5
s. Accordingly, if one partner's ME is matched by the other
partner within this 5-s allowance, it also registers as syn-
chrony. Because analyses were completed at a frame rate of
10 frames/per second, this allows for the calculation of 50
negative-lagged correlations (0 to -5 s), 50 positive-lagged
correlations (0 to +5 s), and one zero-lagged correlation for
each 30-s window. These multiple cross-correlations were
then standardized using Fisher's Z, and their absolute values
were averaged to yield a single synchrony score for each
dyad. This global synchrony score served as our objective
measure of nonverbal synchrony across each interaction.

Although our protocol yielded a robust assortment of data, the
scope of this article only allowed for analyses pertinent to
Tickle-Degnen's model. In accordance with Kenny and col-
leagues' (2006) principle of dyad nonindependence, we aver-
aged interactant rapport ratings (as measured by the IRQ) into
mean dyad scores; likewise, evaluations of interpersonal
behavior were collapsed into dyadic averages. Because sub-
optimal behavior represented both positive and negative
ratings in our coding scheme, researchers squared all scores
and thus translated the scale into a linear format; scores now
ranged from 0 to 9. Although we could have also linearized
scores by taking their absolute value, doing so would have
undervalued ratings of suboptimal experiences. Instead, we
squared these values to increase variability and to emphasize
these suboptimal encounters. To also prevent future misinter-
pretation of correlational analyses, we reversed the scale's
direction so that higher values represented more optimal
action. We then averaged evaluations of both behavioral mea-
sures across the three coders, resulting in a single "Activity"
and "Coordination" score for each interaction. In addition,
because "Activity" and "Coordination" ratings were highly
related, r(50) = .91, p < .001, researchers decided to combine
both variables and create an aggregate measure of coordi-
nated expressivity. Further commentary on the lack of dis-
criminate validity between "Activity" and "Coordination"
ratings is available in the "Discussion" section.
Researchers also conducted a series of control analyses to
help identify potential confounds. A series of t tests revealed
no differences in our dependent variables between the menu
task and close-calls task; similarly, task sequence had no
effect on these same dependent variables (e.g., all tests had a
p > .05). As such, we averaged all dependent variables across
both tasks to yield a single set of scores for each dyad. After
collapsing across tasks, we predictably discovered that indi-
vidual scores on all dependent variables were positively cor-
related between dyad members (e.g., all tests had a p < .05).
Tests of the Optimal Experience Model
Researchers used a Pearson correlation matrix to evaluate the
association between our dependent measures and behavioral
data (see Table 1, which also includes means and standard
deviations for these variables). First, with regard to objective
synchrony, MEA-generated scores did not share any signifi-
cant association with self-reported rapport levels. This finding
runs counter to our hypothesis. The only significant relation-
ship between objective synchrony displays and all posttest
measures occurred with feelings of interpersonal closeness,
r(50) = .28, p = .048. Specifically, as dyads synchronized, they
reported higher levels of closeness. Data resulting from our
coders' thin-slice judgments, however, did support Tickle-
Degnen's predictions. We discovered a strong positive rela-
tionship between dyadic rapport and our composite measure
of coordinated expressivity, r(50) = .46, p = .001. As displays
of coordinated expressivity approached optimal levels, dyads'
self-reported experience of rapport also increased.
In addition, we conducted a hierarchical linear regression
to see whether this relationship retained significance after
accounting for the variance explained by other study vari-
ables. Our model consisted of four steps, with dyadic rap-
port (as measured by the IRQ) entered as our dependent
variable. In Step 1, we included our pre-task measures of
interpersonal difficulties (as measured by the IIP) and
Nelson et al. 7
empathy (as measured by the IRI). In Step 2, we added both
measures of partner familiarity. In Step 3, we included post-
task measures of interpersonal closeness (as measured by the
IOS) and mood (as measured by the PANAS). In our final
step, we included MEA-gnereated synchrony and subjective
ratings of coordinated expressivity. Please see Table 2 for a
depiction of this model and associated results.
The final model reached significance and explained a large
portion of variance in rapport levels, R2 = .61, F(8, 49) = 7.89,
p < .001. After accounting for the other variables, coordinated
expressivity still emerged as a significant predictor of dyadic
rapport, b = .16, p < .001. Moreover, this final step explained
an additional 12% of the variance in rapport levels primarily
due to the coordinated expressivity variable, R2 = .12, F(2,
41) = 6.06, p = .005. Taken together, results from this analysis
further supported our hypothesis.
Discussion
This investigation empirically evaluates Tickle-Degnen's
(2006) adapted optimal experience model, which uniquely
extends Csíkszentmihályi's (1990) original framework to the
rapport ecosystem. Her model acknowledges that rapport
development depends on the nature--and not simply the
presence--of particular behavioral displays. Moreover, it
recognizes that the association between coordinated expres-
sivity and dyadic rapport might be a nonlinear one. Analyses
involving the subjective judgments of interpersonal behavior
suggest that as an interaction becomes plagued by lethargic
or disorderly (i.e., suboptimal) behavior, a decrement in rap-
port levels is also observed. Conversely, interactions marked
by coordinated, well-balanced (i.e., optimal) behavior are
associated with higher rapport ratings. Objective measure-
ments of behavioral coordination did not, however, demon-
strate this pattern.
Indeed, only the subjectively coded behavior of our dyads
supported our hypotheses, and this qualification warrants fur-
ther discussion. One possible reason for this discrepancy
between objective and subjective measures is already known:
MEA-calculated synchrony and subjectively coded coordina-
tion are theoretically distinct measurements. Not only did our
data support their independence, r(50) = .055, p > .05, but

past literature has operationalized these constructs differently.
Because MEA relies on frame differencing to detect synchro-
nous behavior, Ramseyer and Tschacher (2011) concede that
its output is limited to evaluations of dynamic synchrony;
static coordination, as in the mirroring of specific postures or
gestures, is thus overlooked. In contrast, coders' ratings of
interpersonal coordination provided a more holistic measure
of synchrony, as they plainly coded how coordinated the
dyads appeared. Whereas MEA is microanalytical in scope
and thereby generates synchrony scores piecemeal (Bernieri
& Rosenthal, 1991), thin-slice judgments encompass both
posture mimicry and displays of coordinated movement.
A second but related explanation for conflicting results
could be due to the gestalt nature of coordination itself. Most
basically, MEA is a measure of movement dynamics. It has
the capacity to measure the amount, duration, speed, and
complexity of movements between people. Microanalytical
measures such as MEA do not, however, capture all channels
of communication in the behavior stream (Delaherche et al.,
2012), and thus, its scope is limited. MEA cannot account for
any psychological content beyond what is communicated by
gross body movements, and our current setup yielded low-
resolution videos where more psychologically informative
motion (i.e., facial expressions) could not be assessed.
Alternatively, accurate observer judgments appear to be intui-
tive (Ambady, 2010) and a product of human development
(DePaulo & Friedman, 1998), suggesting that computerized
measures might not yet be capable of reliably reproducing the
human evaluation process. It could also explain why the thin-
slice judgment method is considered the "gestalt approach" in
relevant literature (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991). MEA's
objective nature means it has the ability to record pure motion
untainted by accompanying psychological information.
Nevertheless, with this objectivity comes a rigidity that--
unlike human judgments--might fail to capture both behav-
ior and affect. Furthermore, it is possible that our measure of
rapport, which was based on the averages of dyads' self-
reports, may reduce the association between affect and syn-
chrony previously found in a larger sample based on
comparable dyads (Tschacher, Rees, & Ramseyer, 2014).
Also, the apparent lack of discriminant validity between
"Activity/Expressivity" and "Coordination/Synchrony" rat-
ings deserves further mention. A distinction between both
variables is evident at the positive pole of the coding scheme
(i.e., the positive extreme of the Activity/Expressivity spec-
trum represents frenzied movement, and in turn, disharmoni-
ous displays of frenzied movement on the Coordination/
Synchrony spectrum) but not at the negative one. Coders
may have interpreted "bored" interpersonal activity as an
emptiness of activity; however, this emptiness should have
been marked as suboptimal coordination. In this way, coders
still gauged coordination on a looseness-to-tightness scale
(Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991); however, their judgments per-
tain more to the organization and intensity of the movement
than to its synchronicity.
Finally, we acknowledge that our composite measure of
coordinated expressivity may appear to approximate Tickle-
Degnen and Rosenthal's (1990) component of dyadic posi-
tivity. We cite three pieces of evidence to differentiate our
measure of coordinated expressivity from positivity. First,
our task prompts were not designed to foster positive affect
between dyad members; in fact, these prompts were deliber-
ately meant to elicit challenges for the dyad. For example,
the menu task forced dyads to brainstorm foods that they
both disliked, which presumably led to some disagreements.
Furthermore, the close-calls task asked participant to recall
anxiety-inducing events from their lives. Second, we did not
find a significant correlation between PANAS scores and rat-
ings of coordinated expressivity. If coordinated expressivity
was simply a proxy for feelings of positivity, we would
expect a strong positive correlation between these variables.
And third, although we acknowledge that coders may have
been unable to separate their assessments of behavior from
affect, they were instructed to focus on behavior exclusively
when viewing the interactions.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first data-based validation of
Tickle-Degnen's model.Although these conclusions may fall
short of clearing the murkiness surrounding rapport and its
nonverbal indicators, they are still in conversation with
Tickle-Degnen's call for the construct's reconceptualization.
Identifying rapport as optimal experience, however, demands
that future work explores the association between rapport's
affective nature and behavioral elements within different
contexts (e.g., task demands, environment of interaction,
and/or presence of distractors).
Reclassifying rapport as optimal experience also
alludes to the potential overlap between rapport and flow
states. Although both constructs remain theoretically dis-
tinct, this overlap is significant in that it urges develop-
ments associated with one state to inform the other. For
example, Csíkszentmihályi's (1990) original understand-
ing of optimal experience maintained that people most
often reach flow state when managing perceived chal-
lenges in a domain that they are sufficiently skilled in.
Future research could then explore whether active interde-
pendent tasks of an optimal difficulty prime rapport devel-
opment. Investigations into the behavioral indicators of
flow could also build upon work exploring rapport's non-
verbal correlates. In sum, borrowing Csíkszentmihályi's
(1990) model not only strengthens our theoretical grasp
on rapport, but in return, it may lend itself to advance-
ments in flow theory.
Last, we contend that these recommendations are well
suited for data-sharing initiatives, and likewise, that open
science platforms provide an ample opportunity for col-
laborations committed to refining the rapport construct.
Many open science projects, such as the Open Science
Nelson et al. 9
Collaboration's (2015) Reproducibility Project and the
Collaborative Replications and Education Project (Grahe
et al., 2016), focus on close replications alone. In contrast,
this study utilized methodological replication as a means to
additionally tackle novel theoretical questions. We invite
interested theorists to do the same, using four conceptually
related studies and data sets recently published by Nelson
et al. (2014) in The Journal of Open Psychology Data.
These data, as well as a summary of each study, is available
here: http://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/article/view/
jopd.ae/13.
We again encourage potential collaborators to visit our
project profile via the OSF (https://osf.io/dyntp/) for further
study information and access to materials. Ultimately, it is
our hope that future investigations make use of similar ave-
nues to advance studies of the dyadic experience.
