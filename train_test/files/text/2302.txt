Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study,
this study examined the effects of the Great Recession on
maternal harsh parenting. We found that changes in macroeco-
nomic conditions, rather than current conditions, affected harsh
parenting, that declines in macroeconomic conditions had a stron-
ger impact on harsh parenting than improvements in conditions,
and that mothers' responses to adverse economic conditions were
moderated by the DRD2 Taq1A genotype. We found no evidence
of a moderating effect for two other, less well-studied SNPs from
the DRD4 and DAT1 genes.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning,
unjustified terror.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's opening
remarks in his first inaugural address
The "Great Recession" (2007-2009) entailed the largest con-
traction in economic output in the United States since the
Great Depression. In this article, we examine the effects of the
Great Recession on harsh parenting, using data from the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS). We extended prior
work by examining the effects of changes in macroeconomic
conditions as well as current economic conditions, by examining
both declines and improvements in economic conditions, and by
determining whether mothers' responses to economic conditions
were moderated by the DRD2 gene.
The family stress model, developed from studies of the Great
Depression and the Iowa Farm Crisis, posits that economic
hardship leads to stress, which, in turn, leads to deterioration of
parental relationships, mental health, parenting quality, and,
ultimately, child wellbeing (1, 2). Associations consistent with the
family stress model have been found in many other small samples
throughout the United States and Europe. Whereas most studies
in this literature suffer from omitted variables bias--the effects
of economic hardship are identified off differences between
families who do and do not experience large economic losses--
more recent studies have reported similar findings using more
exogenous measures of economic conditions, e.g., plant closings
(3, 4), changes in income transfer policy (5, 6), and unemploy-
ment rates (7, 8). We also used more exogenous measures and
hypothesized that higher unemployment rates were associated
with higher levels of harsh parenting.
Stress may result not only from the actual experience of ad-
versity but also from uncertainty and the anticipation of adver-
sity. Mother monkeys parent less well--and their offspring do
less well--when foraging in poor environments compared with
rich environments. However, both mothers and offspring do
worst when poor and rich environments are varied randomly,
suggesting that uncertainty or insecurity may be more stressful
than the actual experience of adversity (9, 10). Among humans,
anticipation of adverse events with high salience is thought to
elicit stress or anxiety as well as changes in decision making, risk
aversion, and aggression (11­14). Although the unemployment
rate is a good indicator of the probability that an individual will
be unemployed, it may not fully capture the stress associated
with the anticipation of economic adversity. Hedonic adaptation
theory (15) suggests that the emotions elicited by any level of the
unemployment rate depend upon the previous level. For exam-
ple, an unemployment rate of 8% will elicit hope and confidence
if the previous rate was 10%, but fear and anxiety if the previous
level was 6%. Similarly, an 8% rate will elicit greater fear and
anxiety if the previous rate was 4% rather than 7% because the
size (or rate) of the change is much larger for the former than the
latter. Finally, research in behavioral economics demonstrates
that people's responses to losses are greater than their responses
to gains of equal size (16, 17). Drawing on these ideas from the
behavioral sciences, we hypothesized that harsh parenting is as-
sociated with both the direction and the rate of change in mac-
roeconomic conditions and that declines in economic conditions
have larger effects on parenting than improvements in conditions.
Researchers have long observed that individuals vary in their
response to events such as job loss or worsening economic con-
ditions. Early psychological studies attributed such differences to
temperament or behavioral reactivity (18). More recently, the
advent of molecular genetics has allowed researchers to examine
genotypic variance to see whether individuals with certain ge-
netic profiles reacted more negatively than others when exposed
to adverse environments (19). The concept of genetic vulnera-
bility has recently been complemented by the concept of genetic
sensitivity, which posits that individuals with certain genetic
profiles have worse outcomes in unfavorable social environments
but better outcomes in favorable environments (20­24). A com-
mon criticism of this literature is that people may select their
environments, meaning that gene-by-environment interactions
(G × E) may be due to gene-by-environment correlations (rGE)
or gene-by-gene interactions (G × G) (25). The Great Recession
and changes in macroeconomic conditions more generally are
beyond the control of a particular individual and thereby provide
a more exogenous measure of the environment.
The dopaminergic system helps regulate emotional and be-
havioral responses to environmental threats and rewards. Low
efficiency in this neural system has been shown to result in ag-
gression, impulsivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(26­29). Of particular interest is the Taq1A single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) (rs1800497), which is located in the 3
UTR of the DRD2 gene. The T allele of this SNP eliminates the
Taq1 site by replacing a cytosine base with a thymine base. Al-
though far from conclusive, research to date suggests that indi-
viduals possessing at least one T allele have fewer D2 dopamine

receptors in their brains and are more susceptible to reactive
aggression (26, 30) than individuals with the CC alleles. Based on
these findings, we hypothesized that mothers' harsh parenting
behavior as a response to adverse macroeconomic conditions is
moderated by their DRD2 Taq1A genotype.
The FFS is a population-based, longitudinal birth cohort study
of 4,898 children born in 20 large American cities between 1998
and 2000 (31). By design, three fourths of the children in the
study were born to unmarried mothers and one fourth to married
mothers. Mothers were interviewed at birth and reinterviewed
when the child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y old. Data on harsh parenting
were measured when the child was 3, 5, and 9 y old. In year 9, saliva
DNA samples were collected from mothers using the Oragene·
DNA sample collection kit (DNA Genotek) (details are available in
SI Materials and Methods). The analytic sample with valid obser-
vations on study variables contained 2,612 mothers (Table S1).
Maternal harsh parenting was measured using 10 items from
the Conflict Tactics Scale (32). Five items measured psycholog-
ical harsh parenting, and five measured corporal punishment.
Subscales were combined to construct a composite measure of
maternal harsh parenting (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75). Mothers'
risk of exposure to unemployment was measured by the city-level
unemployment rates (UR). Anticipation of unemployment or
economic adversity was measured directly by the national con-
sumer sentiment index (CSI) and indirectly by the rate and di-
rection of change in UR and CSI. The national CSI is salient for
predicting stress because of the ubiquity of television and other
national media. Further, because consumer sentiment is a lead-
ing indicator and unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of
changes in the business cycle, we included both indicators in our
model. Levels of UR and CSI were measured at the time of in-
terview and merged with the FFS data. The rate and direction of
change in UR and CSI were measured by computing the differ-
ence between the value at the time of interview and the 3-mo
lagged value divided by the lagged value, and multiplied by 100.
Ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the
association of maternal harsh parenting with macroeconomic
conditions, DRD2 genotype, and their interactions. To test the
hypothesis that declines in macroeconomic conditions have
a stronger impact on harsh parenting than improvements, we
used a spline function, which allowed positive and negative
changes in each macroeconomic indicator to have their own
slopes and converge at zero. We exploited multiyear variations in
UR and CSI by pooling the FFS data from years 3, 5, and 9 (n =
6,492 person-years). SEs were adjusted for within-individual
correlation. All models controlled for age, race/ethnicity, immigra-
tion status, educational attainment, poverty status, family structure,
child sex, and child age (in months) at the time of interview. We
also controlled for interview wave, quarter of interview month,
and city of residence (analysis details are provided in Materials
and Methods).
Results
Table 1 presents our main results. Column 1 shows the main
effects of levels of and changes in macroeconomic conditions
(Table S2). Deteriorations in macroeconomic conditions, indi-
cated by positive changes in UR and negative changes in CSI,
were associated with increases in maternal harsh parenting. A
ten percent increase in UR led to a 1.6-unit increase in the
number of harsh parenting behaviors (b = 0.16, 95% CI = [0.05,
0.27], P = 0.005). Although not statistically significant, a 10%
decrease in the CSI also led to a 1.3-unit increase in harsh
parenting (b = 0.13, 95% CI = [-0.10, 0.35], P = 0.27). By
contrast, improvements in macroeconomic conditions, indicated
by negative changes in UR and positive changes in CSI, were
associated with much smaller, statistically insignificant changes in
harsh parenting (P = 0.83 and P = 0.43, respectively). Finally, the
levels of UR and CSI affected harsh parenting, but not in the
expected direction (b = -0.70, 95% CI = [-1.34, -0.06], P = 0.03
and b = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.36], P = 0.046, respectively). As
discussed below, however, the level effects were not robust to
model specification. In sum, harsh parenting was not positively
associated with high levels of unemployment but rather with
increases in the unemployment rate and declines in consumer
sentiment, suggesting that the anticipation of adversity was a more
important determinant of harsh parenting than actual exposure.
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 present the full G × E interaction
model to test whether the association between macroeconomic
indicators and harsh parenting varied by mothers' DRD2 Taq1A
genotype. The effect of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions
was more pronounced for mothers carrying a T allele than for
mothers carrying the CC allele. For the T allele carriers, in-
creases in the UR and declines in the CSI strongly increased
harsh parenting. A 10% increase in UR and decrease in CSI led
to a 2.3- and 4-unit increase in harsh parenting (b = 0.23, 95%
CI = [0.07, 0.38], P = 0.005 and b = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.09, 0.72],
P = 0.01, respectively). For the CC allele carriers, however, these
changes had inconsistent and insignificant effects. A 10% increase
in UR and decrease in CSI were associated with a 0.8 increase and
1.8 decrease in harsh parenting (b = 0.08, 95% CI = [-0.07, 0.24],
P = 0.30 and b = -0.18, 95% CI = [-0.50, 0.14], P = 0.27, re-
spectively). As a result, the effect of deteriorating macroeconomic
conditions differed significantly between the T and CC allele
carriers (F(2, 2611) = 3.36, P = 0.03).

By contrast, the effect of improving macroeconomic con-
ditions on harsh parenting was less pronounced. For the T allele
carriers, improvements in UR and CSI reduced harsh parenting,
but the coefficients were smaller and not statistically significant
(b = -0.21, 95% CI = [-0.51, 0.09], P = 0.17 and b = -0.05, 95%
CI = [-0.24, 0.13], P = 0.57, respectively). For the CC allele
carriers, improvements in UR and CSI were associated with ei-
ther increases or decreases in harsh parenting, which were in-
consistent and insignificant (P = 0.15 and P = 0.63, respectively).
Overall, these G × E results lend support to our hypothesis. The
fear of economic adversity, as indicated by deteriorating mac-
roeconomic conditions, played a more critical role in parenting
behavior for mothers with a T allele of DRD2 Taq1A poly-
morphism than for mothers with the CC allele. We found no
evidence of a moderating effect for two other, less well-studied
SNPs from the DRD4 and DAT1 genes.
Because the results above were obtained by estimating the
effects of changes in UR and CSI in the same model, it is difficult
to interpret the model without considering all of the coefficients
at once. In some situations, changes in UR and CSI could give
conflicting signals about changes in the economy. To further
examine the implications of our G × E model for genetic sen-
sitivity, we used the coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 to
simulate the responses of mothers with a T allele and mothers
with the CC allele to unambiguous deteriorations and unambig-
uous improvements in macroeconomic conditions. In Fig. 1,
predicted harsh parenting is shown on the vertical axis and
changes in macroeconomic conditions are shown on the hori-
zontal axis. Deteriorating and improving macroeconomic con-
ditions were measured (in percentile terms) as the distance from
zero change (in the middle). Inspection of 95% confidence bands
indicated that, for mothers with a T allele, harsh parenting clearly
increased as macroeconomic conditions worsened and decreased
as macroeconomic conditions improved. By contrast, for mothers
with the CC allele, harsh parenting changed little if at all in re-
sponse to changes in macroeconomic conditions. These results
suggest that the parenting behaviors of the T allele carriers were
more sensitive than those of the CC allele carriers to changes in
macroeconomic conditions.
We extended our analysis in nine ways. First, to further ex-
plore heterogeneous effects by genotype, we reestimated our
G × E model using two less well-studied SNPs (rs1800955 and
rs40814) from the DRD4 and DAT1genes (details are given in
SI Materials and Methods). The effects of macroeconomic con-
ditions on harsh parenting did not vary by these two dopamine
markers (Table S3 and Figs. S1 and S2).
Second, to the extent that the risk of experiencing unemploy-
ment is heterogeneous within the population and that individuals
are aware of their differential risks, we should observe hetero-
geneity of response not only by genotype but also by differences
in the risk or salience of adverse economic conditions across the
population (33). Thus, we explored heterogeneity of response by
education, race/ethnicity, family structure, and child sex. For the
first three characteristics, we found some evidence for hetero-
geneous responses, with responses being more negative for those
most likely to be adversely affected (Table S4).
Third, the absence of a positive association between the level
of the local UR and harsh parenting was surprising, and thus we
extensively examined plausible alternative specifications to see
whether there was any evidence to support a positive and sig-
nificant UR level effect (Table S5). With one minor exception,
we found no supporting evidence. Fourth, we investigated whether
the level effects of UR and CSI, which were in the unexpected
direction, were driven by their functional forms (Table S6). The
level coefficients were indeed sensitive to alternative functional
forms, suggesting that this effect should not be given much
weight. Fifth, we examined whether the change coefficients were
robust to the exclusion of the UR and CSI level variables (Table
S7). Excluding these variables did not alter our findings. Sixth,
we examined whether family income loss at the individual level
was associated with increases in harsh parenting and whether
controlling for actual income loss affected our main results
(Table S8). Although income loss at the individual level was
associated with increases in harsh parenting, especially for the T
allele carriers, the association was puzzling, as larger losses did
not lead to harsher parenting. Seventh, we examined whether our
results might be strengthened if we used employment-population
ratios rather than unemployment rates (Table S9). The results
were consistent with, but a little weaker in significance than, those
in Table 1. Eighth, we examined whether our results were sen-
sitive to our treatment of mothers who moved to a different city
during the study (Table S10). Accounting for mothers' cross-city

moves did not change the results. Ninth and lastly, we examined
psychological harsh parenting and corporal punishment sepa-
rately (Table S11). Both sets of results were consistent with those
using the composite measure of maternal harsh parenting.
Discussion
This paper extends prior work by examining the relationship
between adverse macroeconomic conditions and maternal harsh
parenting. Because the Great Recession and other more mod-
erate changes in macroeconomic conditions are exogenous to the
individual, our approach allowed us to address shortcomings in
the literatures on both the family stress model and the genetic
sensitivity model. We found that the rate and direction of change
in macroeconomic conditions rather than actual conditions af-
fected harsh parenting, and that declines in conditions had a
stronger impact on parenting than improvements in conditions.
We also found that mothers' responses to changes in economic con-
ditions were moderated by their genetic profiles, such that mothers
with the "sensitive" genotype did worse than their counterparts in
a deteriorating economy and better in an improving economy.
Although we found no evidence that the level of the local UR was
positively associated with harsh parenting, caution is warranted in
interpreting this finding. Actual reductions in income between
interviews did result in greater harsh parenting. The strong effects
for the Taq1A polymorphism of the DRD2 gene should also be
interpreted with caution insofar as we found little effect for other
dopamine genes that were plausible candidates. More research is
needed to disentangle the complex pathways through which a vari-
ety of genetic markers in the dopaminergic system operate together.
Finally, although our findings are consistent with the argument that
uncertainty and anticipation of adverse conditions are mechanism
through which a deteriorating economy leads to aggressive par-
enting, these constructs were not directly measured in this study.
Nonetheless, we provide strong evidence that changes in
macroeconomic conditions, rather than current conditions, af-
fect harsh parenting, that declines in macroeconomic conditions
have a stronger impact on harsh parenting than improvements in
conditions, and that mothers' responses to adverse economic
conditions are moderated by the DRD2 Taq1A genotype. These
findings demonstrate the importance of attending to the non-
economic costs of macroeconomic changes, population hetero-
geneity in response to macroeconomic shocks, and exogenous
measurement of environmental stressors in G × E research.
Materials and Methods
The FFS is a national longitudinal birth cohort study that follows 4,898
children, 1,186 of whom were born to married parents and 3,712 were born
to unmarried parents (31). They represent children born in 20 large US cities
with population greater than 200,000 between 1998 and 2000. Baseline
interviews were conducted shortly after the birth, with mothers interviewed
in the hospital and fathers interviewed either in the hospital or wherever
they could be located. Follow-up surveys were conducted when the focal
child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y of age. In year 9, saliva DNA samples were collected
from mothers using the Oragene· DNA sample collection kit (DNA Genotek)
and retained at room temperature until DNA extraction (laboratory of D.N.,
Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) according to the protocol supplied by
the manufacturer. The analytic sample consisted of 2,612 mothers who (i)
were interviewed at least once during the years 3, 5, and 9 surveys, (ii)
provided usable saliva during the year 9 survey, and (iii) had valid obser-
vations on study variables (details on variable construction and dopamine
genetic variation are provided in SI Materials and Methods). For access to the
FFS data, visit www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/index.asp. The study pro-
tocol was approved by the institutional review board of Princeton University
and informed consent was obtained in line with the study protocol.
We conducted our analysis by estimating two models. The first model
examined the effect of macroeconomic conditions on harsh parenting. To test
the hypothesis that declines in macroeconomic conditions have a stronger
impact than improvements, we applied a spline function to the measures of
changes in the local UR and the CSI (34). It allowed deteriorating and im-
proving changes in each macroeconomic indicator to have their own slopes
and at the same time their effects to converge at zero. To exploit multiyear
variations in UR and CSI, we pooled the FFS data from years 3, 5, and 9 with
SEs adjusted for within-individual correlation. The equation for the model
is given by:
MHPit
= a + b1
CEit
+ b2
LEit
+ cXit
+ dWaveit
+ eSeasonit
+ fCityi
+ «it
; [1]
where MHPit
is mother i's harsh parenting score in year t, CE denotes de-
teriorating and improving changes in UR and CSI, LE denotes levels of UR
and CSI, and X is a vector of the control variables described above. We in-
cluded in the model interview wave-, season-, and city-fixed effects to rule
out the possibility that periodic, seasonal, and geographical variations
could induce a spurious association between macroeconomic conditions
and harsh parenting.
The second model examined the G × E effect on harsh parenting of mac-
roeconomic conditions and DRD2 Taq1A genotype. We used the full interaction
G × E model such that Eq. 1 was estimated separately for mothers carrying a T
allele and for mothers carrying the CC allele. We found that the effect of de-
teriorating macroeconomic conditions differed significantly between mothers
with a T allele and those with the CC allele (F(2, 2611) = 3.36, P = 0.03). In ad-
dition, among mothers carrying a T allele, the effect of deteriorating macro-
economic conditions, indicated by positive changes in UR and negative changes
in CSI, differed significantly from that of improving macroeconomic conditions,
indicated by negative changes in UR and positive changes in (F(1, 1396) = 10.75,
P = 0.001). However, among mothers carrying the CC allele, the effect of de-
teriorating macroeconomic conditions did not differ significantly from that of
improving macroeconomic conditions (F(1, 1214) = 1.38, P = 0.24).
The simulation results in Fig. 1 were derived as follows. To calculate the
predicted values of harsh parenting from our G × E model in Table 1, levels
of UR and CSI were set to their mean values and all covariates to their ob-
served values. To plot the predicted values when macroeconomic conditions
declined, deteriorating changes in UR and CSI were assigned to their per-
centile values whereas improving changes in UR and CSI were assigned to
zero. Conversely, to plot the predicted values when macroeconomic con-
ditions improved, improving changes in UR and CSI were assigned to their
percentile values whereas deteriorating changes in UR and CSI were assigned
to zero. We plotted these predicted values on harsh parenting against changes
in macroeconomic conditions with 95% confidence bands.
