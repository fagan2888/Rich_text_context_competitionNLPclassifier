Cultural Values

Abstract
Using 347 parent­child dyads as participants, this study directly examined in-law and mate preferences in a typical collectivist
culture. The results showed (1) traits indicating social status and parental investment were more highly valued by the parents,
while traits indicating genetic quality and traits related to romantic love were more highly valued by the children. (2) Parental
preferences were moderated by gender of the in-laws. Good earning capacity was more preferred by parents in a son-in-law,
traits connoting genetic quality and reproductive fitness were more preferred by parents in a daughter-in-law. (3) There was more
convergence in in-law and mate preferences in Chinese culture than in Western cultures. (4) Traditional cultural values (i.e., filial
piety) can be used as a predictor of traditional mate preferences and less parent­child divergences. Additionally, greater
preference for kind and understanding by parents than by children as well as by daughters than by sons, and greater preference
for social status by the daughters' than by the sons' parents have not been observed in the rating and the ranking instrument.
These findings illustrated how culture handles the parent­child disagreement over mating by authorizing greater parental
influence on children's mating decisions.

In most societies and historical periods, parents often have a
strong influence on their children's mating decisions because
of their genetic relatedness to and power over their children
(Perilloux, Fleischman, & Buss, 2008; Schlomer, Del Giudice,
& Ellis, 2011). The selection of an in-law can bring tremendous
survival and reproduction advantages to parents and their
family. To maximize their genetic interests, parents prefer spe-
cific traits in a prospective in-law. However, the traits desired
by the parents do not necessarily maximize the genetic interests
of their children, given that parents and children have a coeffi-
cient of genetic relatedness of 0.50. Specifically, the parents
prefer their child having a mate of high parental investment that
is beneficial for all the parents' children and grandchildren, and
the child prefers having a mate of high genetic quality, because
he or she may obtain more genetic benefits for his or her own
offspring than the parents (Apostolou, 2016; Buunk, Park, &
Dubbs, 2008; Trivers, 1974). This translates into agreement but
also disagreement regarding what is considered an ideal mate
(Schlomer et al., 2011; Trivers, 1974).
Parent­offspring divergence in mate preferences seems to
be universal, but the degree to which children adopt parental
preferences may also vary across cultures (Bejanyan, Marshall,
& Ferenczi, 2014, 2015; Buunk, Park, & Duncan, 2010; Buunk,
Pollet, & Dubbs, 2012; Dubbs, Buunk, & Taniguchi, 2013). As
a crucial cultural dimension for understanding human behavior
in different populations, individualism­collectivism (Hofstede,
1980) has been found to be strongly associated with the level of
parental influence on mating (Bejanyan et al., 2014, 2015;
Buunk et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010). Individualistic cul-
tures encourage independence and uniqueness, advocating

self-determination, and personal choice. In individualistic
cultures, the qualities seen as desirable in a mate are a personal
matter. But in collectivist cultures, people tend to consider the
well-being of the in-group over their own and are more likely to
abandon personal desires that conflict with the in-group wel-
fare (Buunk et al., 2008; Dubbs et al., 2013). Therefore, a high
degree of parental influence on children's mate choice seems
more acceptable in collectivist cultures. China is a typical col-
lectivist society characterized by high endorsement of Confu-
cian filial piety (Ho, 1994; Nichol, 2013; Schwartz et al.,
2010), a value system that originated from ancient China and
is still influential in many Asian countries. By moralizing
children's obedience to family elders and authorizing parental
control over the children's mate preferences and mating stra-
tegies, filial piety may successfully solve an evolutionary
problem for parents (Nichol, 2013). Children are socialized
to be deferential and obedient to family elders, prioritizing the
interests of family members and extended family members
over their own. Children who violate filial obligations always
experience negative emotions such as guilt and shame
(Schwartz et al., 2010). This can lead to significantly greater
harmony between parents and children compared with their
Western counterparts. In this study, we used Chinese parent­
child dyads as participants to directly compare their in-law
and mate preferences. This will make a valuable addition to
the emerging evolutionary psychological literature testing
parent­offspring conflict theory (Schlomer et al., 2011; Trivers,
1974) in different cultural settings.
Divergence Between In-Law and Mate Preferences
Parents and children are genetically related but not genetically
identical. This translates into overlapping as well as diverging
in-law and mate preferences. A child's marriage can increase
his or her parent's inclusive fitness by (1) leading to the pro-
duction of genetically high-quality grandchildren and (2) for-
ging political alliances that increase the fitness of kin other than
the betrothed. Because grandchildren are half as genetically
related to grandparents as they are to parents, prospective
grandparents will tend to weight the production of healthy
grandchildren as relatively less important as prospective par-
ents will (Apostolou, 2007a; Perilloux et al., 2008; Trivers,
1974). Genetic quality, as indexed by traits such as physical
attractiveness, athleticism, creativity, and intelligence, can
bring about asymmetric costs and benefits for parents and for
children. Higher genetic quality in a mate may result in heal-
thier, more attractive, and probably more successful offspring.
But an individual can reap more genetic benefits from a geneti-
cally high-quality mate than his or her parents from a geneti-
cally high-quality in-law, because he or she share more genetic
overlap with his or her own children (50%) than his or her
parents with their grandchildren (25%). If children's mate
selection is based on their own preferences, they should give
more weight to genetic quality in a potential mate than parents
in an in-law (Apostolou, 2010a, 2015a; Buunk et al., 2008;
Perilloux, Fleischman, & Buss, 2011; Schlomer et al., 2011).
There are also characteristics (e.g., good family background)
that are more preferred in an in-law than in a spouse (Buunk
et al., 2008; Perilloux et al., 2011), because these characteris-
tics can extend parents' cooperative alliances and enhance their
status, giving more fitness benefits to parents than to children.
However, the discrepancy mentioned above may only make
sense if there is a cost to the parents. That is, if a genetically
high-quality mate is a bad parent, or if parents prioritize other
traits over genetic quality.
The divergence in mate preferences between parents and
children, especially between parents' and daughters', can also
be understood in terms of evolutionary trade-offs (Gangestad
& Simpson, 2000; Trivers, 1974). That is, pursuing one type
of benefit inevitably reduces the likelihood of obtaining
another type of benefit. From a biological point of view, the
benefits provided by a mate can be grouped into two main
clusters: heritable fitness and parental investment. High
genetic quality in an in-law contributes to parents' fitness
through the birth of genetically high-quality offspring (i.e.,
the parents' grandchildren). However, individuals of high
genetic quality may probably be poorer quality parents, as
they tend to invest more effort into seeking new mates than
into raising children (Apostolou, 2016; Trivers, 1974). Mating
with a partner of high genetic quality, but low investment
potential may lead a daughter to depend on her parents and
other kin for support. This will limit the parents' ability to
invest in their children and grandchildren. Moreover, an in-
law of good investment potential can bring fitness interests to
the parents and their family through protection and resources
provision or childcare. As a consequence, when evaluating the
suitability of a potential in-law, parents would place more
value on traits indicating parental investment and cooperation
with in-group compared with the children themselves.
Findings suggest that parents are more interested in control-
ling their daughters' than their sons' mating decisions (Apos-
tolou, 2007b, 2010b, 2015b, 2017; Dubbs, Buunk, & Li, 2012;
Dubbs et al., 2013; Perilloux et al., 2008). Female invests more
in her offspring, so the trade-off between good-provider and
good-genes selection is especially relevant for daughters
(Buunk et al., 2008). So a son-in-law of good investment poten-
tial is more highly valued by the daughter's parents than by the
daughter herself. Selecting an investing son-in-law is espe-
cially important for survival of the daughters' children, as par-
ents are certain that they are genetically related to the offspring
of their daughter than to that of their son. If a son-in-law is a
poor investor, the parents are pressured to take the responsibil-
ity to invest in their daughter's offspring themselves (Perilloux
et al., 2008). Moreover, females are especially valuable repro-
ductive resource in the mating markets to which males strive to
access. While a sexual adventure can damage a daughter's
reputation and decrease her long-term mate value, leading to
detrimental consequences for her parents' fitness interests
(Apostolou, 2009, 2015b; Perilloux et al., 2008). Therefore, a
successful control of their daughters' mating behaviors may
enable the parents to maximize their own inclusive fitness by
extracting more resources from their sons-in-law or by building
2 Evolutionary Psychology
new alliances and elevating social status. In some cultures,
parents may even pressure their daughters to marry into a
family with economic success and strong social standing
(Apostolou, 2010a, b; Bejanyan et al., 2014, 2015). Therefore,
we can infer that parents may be choosier in the selection of a
son-in-laws versus a daughter-in-laws, as parents are more
likely to exert stricter control over the daughters' versus the
sons' mating decisions (Buunk et al., 2008).
Recent literature has explored the areas of divergence in
mate and in-law preferences (see Apostolou, 2015b, for a
review). For example, Perilloux, Fleischman, and Buss
(2011) compared the students' preferences for 13 traits in a
prospective mate with their actual parents' preferences for the
same set of traits in a prospective in-law. They found that traits
such as religious, good housekeeper, earning capacity, healthy,
and kindness were more preferred by parents in an in-law
(Perilloux et al., 2011), while physical attractiveness and excit-
ing personality were more highly valued by offspring in a
spouse. Similarly, in Chinese immigrants to North America,
Hynie, Lalonde, and Lee (2006) found that traditional mate
characteristics (e.g., chastity, housekeeping abilities, having
strong cultural ties, and wanting children) are more preferred
by the parents in an in-law than by the children in a spouse.
In another line of research, participants were asked to act as
parents and express their in-law preferences and act as children
and express their mate preferences. Results showed that the
participants valued attractiveness and exciting personality
more in a spouse than in an in-law and valued good family
background and similar religious background more in an in-
law than in a spouse (e.g., Apostolou, 2008a, 2008b, 2014).
Because selecting an in-law of desirable backgrounds is helpful
for parents to strengthen family relations and build new
alliances (Apostolou, 2007a; Bejanyan et al., 2015).
Using a similar methodology, participants were given
specific negative traits (i.e., unattractive and bad family back-
ground, etc.) in a potential mate, and where asked to rate
whether said traits would be relatively more unacceptable to
themselves or to their parents (Buunk et al., 2008; Dubbs &
Buunk, 2010; Dubbs et al., 2013). Results showed that traits
connoting a lack of heritable fitness (e.g., attractiveness) were
considered more unacceptable to the children, while a lack of
traits connoting parental investment and cooperation with
in-group (e.g., good family background and similar religious
background) was considered more unacceptable to their par-
ents. Lacking traits related to romantic love (e.g., exciting per-
sonality, a sense of humor) was more acceptable to children
than to parents because such traits are correlates of genetic
quality and can facilitate amicable cohabitation and coopera-
tion in love-based marriage relationships (Buunk et al., 2008).
The Influences of Culture
Parental influences on their children's mate selection are con-
siderably different across cultures (Apostolou, 2010b; Bejan-
yan et al., 2014, 2015; Buunk et al., 2010, 2012; Dubbs et al.,
2013; Hynie, Lalonde, & Lee, 2006). In individualistic cultures
that advocate freedom of personal choice, mate selection is
mainly based on personal preferences, stressing mutual love
and attraction (Buunk et al., 2010). Individuals are encouraged
to exercise personal control over their mate selection and
relationship maintenance. In collectivist cultures where the
well-being of the in-group is prioritized over individuals' own
needs, building new alliances is often a key objective for
marriage. Parents and close kin are often involved in partner
selection by directly choosing the spouse or introducing
potential partners to one another (Buunk et al., 2010; MacDo-
nald, Marshall, Gere, Shimotomai, & Lies, 2012). Children's
marriage is often utilized by their parents to forge new alli-
ances, strengthen social standing, and continue family line
(Bejanyan et al., 2014, 2015). The acceptance of a high degree
of parental influence in mate selection leads the offspring to
adopt and internalize parental preferences, resulting in lower
levels of parents­child discrepancy.
Endorsement of traditional mate characteristics and
greater parent­child convergence regarding mate prefer-
ences have indeed been observed in collectivist cultures.
A cross-cultural study (Buss et al., 1990) found that the
collectivists placed greater value on traditional mate char-
acteristics such as health, desire for children, chastity, and
domestic skills of the potential mates, and fewer values
were given to dependability, mutual attraction, sociability,
pleasing disposition, exciting personality, and appearance.
Bejanyan, Marshall, and Ferenczi (2015) found that the col-
lectivists (i.e., Indian) tended to accept greater parental
influence on their mate choice, which contributed to a
smaller gap between adult children's preferences for the
qualities signifying status resources in a spouse and their
perception of their parents' preferences. The collectivists
also reported greater family allocentrism (Bejanyan et al.,
2015), characterized as the closeness family members feel
toward one another, which contributed to the smaller dis-
crepancy between their own preferences for qualities sig-
nifying warmth trustworthiness in a spouse and their
perception of their parents' preferences.
China is a typical collectivist society (Hofstede, 1980) char-
acterized by the ideology of filial piety that stipulates chil-
dren's obligations and duties to their parents, familial elders,
and ancestors through a set of closely related behaviors, ritual
practices, dispositions, and mental states (Nichols, 2013; Smith
& Hung, 2012). Children often comply with parental wishes
and strive to meet the expectations set by their parents, leading
to the children's mate preferences being in greater harmony
with their parents' in-law preferences than populations else-
where in the world (Nichols, 2013). China has a long history
of Confucian sex ideology in favor of male power over female.
Women have been traditionally required to be submissive to
men and to stay in family to support the male members of the
family. Woman should be obedient to her father and older
brothers before marriage, obedient to her husband after mar-
riage, and obedient to her sons in widowhood (Chia, Allred, &
Jerzak, 1997; Cook & Dong, 2011). This Confucian male-
superior gender norm has been dominating China for over
Guo et al. 3
2,500 years and is still influential in present society. Recent
studies reveal that males' main responsibilities are supporting
the family; females' main responsibilities are household and
child-rearing tasks (Chia et al., 1997; Chen, Fiske, & Lee,
2009). In these cultural and historical settings, the mate prefer-
ences of the Chinese are expected to be different from those of
the Westerners.
The Present Study
Recent literature suggests that parental influence should be
taken into consideration when applying theories of sexual
selection (e.g., Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson,
2000). Across different cultures and time, humans often have
limited freedom and autonomy in mate choice (Apostolou,
2010a, b). Human mate preferences can also be substantially
affected by culture. Across the 31 characteristics examined by
Buss et al. (1990), culture accounted for an average of 14% of
the variance. Cultural variations have also been observed in
parent­child discrepancy over mating, with greater parental
influence on mating in collectivist cultures than in individua-
listic cultures (Bejanyan et al., 2014, 2015; Buunk et al., 2010;
Dubbs et al., 2013).
There is still a scarcity of literature investigating parental
influence over mating in mainland China, one of the most
collectivist societies (Hofstede, 1980) characterized by a
high endorsement of filial piety. Unlike other collectivist
values (e.g., communalism, familism), the ideology of filial
piety primarily emphasizes the value of obedience of chil-
dren to parents. This enables the parents to extract more
resources out of their children and impose special obliga-
tions on children concerning reproductive behaviors and
mate selection (Nichols, 2013). As a consequence, Chinese
adult children are more likely to accept their parents' influ-
ence or develop mate preferences similar to their parents
and show more preferences for traditional marriage values
than participants everywhere in the world (Buss et al., 1990;
Nichols, 2013).
This is the first study designed to directly compare mate and
in-law preferences in Chinese culture. Some findings are
expected to be culturally universal that reflects human evolved
predispositions (Apostolou, 2008a). For example, traits indicat-
ing parental investment and cooperation with the in-group
should be more preferred by Chinese parents in an in-law,
while traits indicating genetic quality and traits related to
romantic love should be more preferred by Chinese children
in a spouse (Bejanyan et al., 2014, 2015); The parents' prefer-
ences in an in-law should also be moderated by the gender of
the in-law. Most importantly, there should be cultural-specific
findings that can be explained by traditional cultural values
characterized by the ideology of filial piety. Specifically, there
should be less parent­child divergence in mate preferences in
Chinese culture than in Western cultures (Hypothesis 1). Filial
piety can be used as a predictor of Chinese children's tradi-
tional mate preferences and less parent­child divergence in
mating (Hypothesis 2).
Method
Research Instruments
Factors in choosing a mate. This is a rating instrument (i.e., a
normative scale) used by Buss et al. (1990). Its Chinese version
was introduced by Chang, Wang, Shackelford, and Buss
(2011). The participants were requested to rate each of the 18
characteristics on a 4-point scale with 3 ¼ indispensable and
0 ¼ unimportant according to their importance in choosing a
long-term mate.
Preferences concerning potential mates. This is a ranking instru-
ment (i.e., an ipsative scale) used by Buss et al. (1990) and its
Chinese version was also introduced by Chang et al. (2011).
The participants were requested to rank the 13 characteristics
from most desirable (the rank is 1) to 13th desirable (the rank is
13) in a potential long-term mate, and each of the characteris-
tics should be assigned a number according to their importance.
Given that the ipsative scales can only capture relative rather
than absolute importance of the characteristics in the scales
with no variance of the total scores across participants, we
primarily relied on findings in the rating instrument for com-
parisons. Because findings from the ranking instrument should
differ predictably in magnitude, but not in direction, from find-
ings from the rating instruments (Feingold, 1992).
The Filial Piety Scale (FPS). FPS was developed by Ho (1994) to
assess filial attitudes (e.g., "After the father has passed away,
sons and daughters must conduct themselves according to
the principles and attitudes the father followed while he was
still living," "No matter how their parents conduct them-
selves, sons and daughters must respect them"). All the
22 items in FPS were scored on a 7-point scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Cronbach's a
was .88 in this study.
Participants and Procedure
The study was conducted under the approval of the institu-
tional review board at Shandong Normal University. We
recruited 351 undergraduates from a university in East China
with students coming from all over the country. After deleting
invalid cases due to incomplete responses, there were 347
undergraduates (160 sons, Mage
¼ 19.51, SDage
¼ 1.33; 187
daughters, Mage
¼ 19.25, SDage
¼ 0.75), 312 mothers (Mage
¼
45.85, SDage
¼ 2.78), and 310 fathers (Mage
¼ 47.06, SDage
¼
3.19) left in our data set. Among them, there were 152 son­
mother dyads, 151 son­father dyads, 165 daughter­mother
dyads, and 162 daughter­father dyads. Each participant
received five gel pens for compensation.
After the undergraduates filled out the research instru-
ments, they were required to send home the research instru-
ments for their parents together with elaborate instructions.
Only the rating and the ranking instruments were admini-
strated to the parents. The male and female parents were
instructed to independently indicate their preferences for an
4 Evolutionary Psychology
in-law in the research instruments that were required to be
mailed back. The instructions for parents were transformed
into the following words:
Imagine that your child who is in our university is choosing
a long-term mate, you have right to express opinions on
what characteristics the prospective mate should have.
Please rate (or rank) these characteristics according to their
importance. If your child is a daughter, you are expressing
your preferences in a son-in-law; if your child is a son, you
are expressing your preferences in a daughter-in-law. Your
opinions are important for us.
Results
Before data analysis, we averaged the rating/ranking scores of
each child's parents together to get a parental rating/ranking
score for each trait for that child. For the single-parent child,
the mother's or the father's scores were used as the parents'
scores. A grand mean of the items in the rating instrument but
not in the ranking instrument was calculated.
Comparing In-Law and Mate Preferences
Descriptive statistics were shown in Table 1 (the rating instru-
ment) and Table 2 (the ranking instrument).
To analyze parent­child divergence in the 31 characteris-
tics, General Linear Models (GLMs) were conducted with one
within-subject factor (child vs. parent) and one between-
subject factor (male vs. female).

These results indicated that the parents showed greater pre-
ferences for traditional mate characteristics than their children,
while the children showed greater preferences for traits indi-
cating genetic quality and characteristics related to romantic
marriage relationships.

But the daughters' parents were not more demanding than the

heritage of traditional Chinese cultural values.
Filial Piety as a Predictor of Preference for Traditional
Traits (PTTs) and Less Parent­Child Divergence
Correlations between filial piety and individual items are
shown in Table 3 (the rating instrument) and Table 4 (the
ranking instrument).
We predicted that in Chinese culture, there is less parent­
child divergence regarding what constitute an ideal mate for the
children. Spearman's correlation and effect sizes (Cohen,
1992) were calculated as the indicators of overall parent­child
convergence in mate preference. In the rating instrument, the
correlation between parents and children, between parents and
sons, and between parents and daughters were .94, .96, and .93,
respectively (Cohen's d ¼ .23, .32, and .25). In the ranking
instrument, the correlations were .95, .94, and .94, respectively
(Cohen's d ¼ .30, .37, and .32). These correlation coefficients
were higher than those we calculated using the data of an
American sample reported by Perilloux et al. (2011), which
were .71, .76, and .70, respectively (Cohen's d ¼ .31, .54, and
.27). A medium effect size (Cohen, 1992) was only observed in
the American sample. These results suggested more parent­
child convergence in Chinese culture.
We further hypothesized that more parent­child conver-
gence in Chinese culture can be attributed to children's PTTs,
which may be explained by filial piety. Based on the previous
literature (Buss et al., 1990; Hynie et al., 2006), we used 10
characteristics (similar political background, similar educa-
tional background, favorable social status, desire for home
and children, good cook and housekeeper, good health, good
financial prospect, chastity, sociability, and similar religious
background) to measure the PTTs. These items were aver-
aged to create a PTT Scale, with internal consistency (Cron-
bach's a) acceptable both for parents (a ¼ .70) and for
children (a ¼ .70). Results showed that the children's filial
piety scores was related to their PTT scores, r ¼ .18, p < .01
(two-tailed), but was not related to their parents' PTT scores,
r ¼ À.04, p ¼ .49 (two-tailed). Filial piety also correlated
negatively with the absolute parent­child PTT score differ-
ence, r ¼ À.16, p < .01 (two-tailed). For items in the rating
instrument, filial piety correlated positively with similar
political background, r ¼ .12, p < .05 (two-tailed), desire for
home and children, r ¼ .24, p < .001 (two-tailed), good cook
and housekeeper, r ¼ .15, p < .01 (two-tailed), chastity, r ¼
.27, p < .001 (two-tailed), and sociability, r ¼ .12, p < .05
(two-tailed); and negatively with education and intelligence,
r ¼ À.11, p < .05 (two-tailed). Filial piety also correlated
negatively with the absolute parent­child score difference in
desire for home and children, r ¼ À.18, p < .01 (two-tailed),
chastity, r ¼ À.18, p < .01 (two-tailed), and sociability, r ¼
À.13, p < .05 (two-tailed).
For the ranking instrument, filial piety correlated negatively
with wants children, r ¼ À.23, p < .001 (two-tailed), and posi-
tively with exciting personality, r ¼ .17, p < .01 (two-tailed),

creative and artistic, r ¼ .18, p < .01 (two-tailed), and intelli-
gence, r ¼.15, p < .01 (two-tailed). Filial piety also correlated
negatively with the absolute parent­child score difference in
creative and artistic, r ¼ À.12, p < .05 (two-tailed), and wants
children, r ¼ À.13, p < .05 (two-tailed). But we failed to create
a reliable scale measuring the PTTs.
These results indicated that the children who endorsed the
ideology of filial piety were more likely to accept traditional
marriage values and develop mate preferences similar to their
parents and were less likely to value characteristics indicating
genetic quality and traits related to romantic love.
Discussion
In human history, evolutionary pressures have resulted in in-
law and mate preferences to diverge (Gangestad, Haselton, &
Buss, 2006). Both parents and children have evolved mating
preferences which enable the two parties to select mates and
in-laws to maximize the inclusive fitness of their own (Apos-
tolou, 2007b, 2008a, 2008b; Buunk et al., 2008; Perilloux
et al., 2011). Results in this study are consistent with these
findings. Traits indicating parental investment and traditional
values were more highly valued by the parents, while traits
indicating genetic quality and romantic love were more
highly valued by the children. Chinese parents preferred
characteristics such as the similar religious background in
an in-law more so than the children in a spouse. Chinese
children preferred characteristics such as dependable charac-
ter and good looks in a spouse more so than the parents in an
in-law. Good financial prospect and sociability were more
preferred in a son-in-law than in a daughter-in-law by the
parents. Traits connoting genetic quality and reproductive
fitness (e.g., physical attractiveness) and traits related to fam-
ily care (e.g., good cook and housekeeper) were more pre-
ferred by the parents for a daughter-in-law than a son-in-law.
These results suggested that the nature of parent­child diver-
gence over mating may be a cultural universal.
Less Divergence Between In-law and Mate Preferences
and the Role of Traditional Cultural Values
However, this study also has revealed some culture-specific
findings that should be interpreted by Chinese traditional cul-
tural values. This study found more parent­child convergences
in mate preferences compared with Western samples (Perilloux
et al., 2011). This is in line with previous findings that East
Asians tend to accept more parental influence on mate choice
than Europeans and European Americans (Buunk et al., 2010,
2012; Nichols, 2013). Endorsement of filial piety can lead
Chinese children to accept traditional marriage values, result-
ing in less parent­child divergence in mating. This finding is
further supported by literature showing that Taiwanese adoles-
cents with stronger filial beliefs were found to be less likely to
experience parent­child conflict (Yeh & Bedford, 2004).
Therefore, both Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.
In China, the disagreement in in-law and mate preferences
can be handled effectively in a cultural-specific way. That is,
parent­offspring conflict over mating that arises from diver-
ging genetic interests can be handled in a way that it does not
escalate. Through the internalization of filial obligations,
children are more willing to accept the traditional marriage
values (continuing family line, enlarging family resources,
improving social status, and bringing honor to ancestors) and
are less committed to love-based marriages. The desire for
chastity in a potential mate is a good testimony to show the
internalization of parental preferences in Chinese children's
mating behaviors. Buss et al. (1990) observed stronger desir-
ability for chastity in a potential mate in both Chinese males
and females, indicating stronger traditional mate preferences
than the participants everywhere in the world.
The Daughters' Parents Were Not More Demanding
Than the Sons' Parents
Parents are supposed to be more demanding in selecting a son-
in-law than a daughter-in-law (Buunk et al., 2008). For

8 Evolutionary Psychology
example, Apostolou (2010a) investigated 67 preindustrial
societies and found that parents valued wealth, working ability,
social status, and good economic prospects more in a son-in-
law than in a daughter-in-law. Only chastity was valued by the
parents more in a daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law.
But in this study, the daughters' parents were even less
demanding than the son's parents (though the difference was
not significant). There are evolutionary explanations for this
phenomenon. Parents are expected to be more vigilant partic-
ularly about a daughter's early sexual activity because it is
more likely to drain their own resources if it leads to a child
out of "wedlock" (Perilloux et al., 2008). But this does not
necessarily result in more choosiness in selecting a long-term
mate for a daughter. On the other hand, the sons' parents could
also be stricter in in-law selection. If a daughter-in-law is
unfaithful or does not take good care of her offspring, the
parents may run the risk of losing all investments in their son
(Buss & Schmitt, 1993).
But Chinese culture should also be taken into account when
understanding this phenomenon. After a female is married, she
becomes a member of her husband's family unit (this is seldom
the case for a male) and takes the responsibility to bear children
to continue the family line of her husband's paternal ancestors
(Nichols, 2013; Smith & Hung, 2012). If a daughter-in-law is
well educated and comes from good family background, she is
expected to be capable of rearing high-quality children. More-
over, in traditional China, wealth was inherited through the
male line from father to son (Nichols, 2013; Smith & Hung,
2012). A virtuous (e.g., chaste, filial, and industrious)
daughter-in-law played a key role in enhancing cooperation
with in-group, maintaining and enlarging family property, and
raising family standing. Additionally, when the parents get
older and gradually lose control over family resources, they
mainly depend on daughter-in-laws for elderly care (Cook &
Dong, 2011).
Other Culture-specific Findings
This study has revealed some interesting findings that should
be interpreted by Chinese traditional values and gender role
ideology. First, desire for home and children and healthy were
more preferred by the parents in an in-law than by the children
in a spouse, while in Western cultures (e.g., Perilloux et al.,
2011) this phenomenon has not been observed. These results
again revealed that Chinese parents prefer in-laws with tradi-
tional traits in order to continue ancestral line (Hynie et al.,
2006). In China, the piety of a son is proportional to the number
of and quality of children, and bearing a male heir was the son's
highest duty. The desire for children is also preferred by the
daughters' parents in a son-in-law because their daughters'
marriages might be stabilized by the birth of babies. Second,
kind and understanding was more preferred by parents than by
children and was more preferred by daughters than by sons in
Western samples (Perilloux et al., 2011). As a kind mate is
more willing to dedicate time and energy in childcare. But in
this study, kind and understanding was less preferred by
parents than by children and was less preferred by female than
by male participants. This suggests that kindness was less val-
ued by parents (especially the daughters') than by children. For
the parents (especially the daughters'), generosity of an in-law
may result in resources being allocated to genetically unrelated
ones (Guo, Feng, & Wang, 2017; Oda, Shibata, Kiyonari,
Takeda, & Matsumoto-Oda, 2013). But for the children, kind-
ness is important for love-based marriage because it can pro-
mote a harmonious partnership and amicable cohabitation
(Apostolou, 2008b). Third, Western parents prefer working
ability and social status more in a son-in-law than in a
daughter-in-law (Apostolou, 2007a, 2008a, 2008b), but in this
study these differences have not been observed, given that the
in-laws' social status and ambition and industries were highly
valued both by the sons' and daughter's parents. This can also
be interpreted as the influence of traditional culture values and
gender role socialization in Chinese society. An industrious,
high social status daughter-in-law is capable of rearing high-
quality children and taking care of family elders, these charac-
teristics are especially valuable for the son's parents (Nichols,
2013; Smith & Hung, 2012).
Findings in this study add to the literature illustrating how
cultural values have shaped human mating behaviors (Buunk
et al., 2010). Humans have evolved psychological adaptations
that are specifically designed to receive and process variable
social and cultural input. Thus, they are exceptionally respon-
sive to the cultural environments they are exposed to (Gang-
estad et al., 2006). Taking into account parental influences,
social and ecological conditions may enable us to more accu-
rately understand the evolution of human mating behavior
(Apostolou, 2007b).
Some findings in this study may not be specific to Chinese
ethnic groups. Literature shows that filial piety, familism, and
communalism share a common thread in stressing the impor-
tance of social ties over individual interests and valuing the
needs of the in-group over the needs of individual person
(Schwartz et al., 2010). We infer that people from other col-
lectivist cultures may also be more likely to accept traditional
mate values and have mate preferences more similar to their
parents' in-law preferences. This may be particularly the case
in places where people live near their parents and extended
families and depend on kin. Even in Western samples, the
participants who are more concerned about their parents' opi-
nions are more likely to shift their mate preferences to conform
to those of their parents (Dubbs et al., 2012). That is, the indi-
viduals' sensitivity toward parents is positively linked with
their preferences for parental investment and cooperation in a
potential mate.
This work is not without limitations. One being that it exam-
ined in-law preferences using instruments containing a greater
number of traditional/parental investment traits, compared to
traits indicative of genetic quality. Future studies should
include more traits that in theory children would prefer in a
mate. Furthermore, this study found that Chinese children are
socialized to accept traditional marriage values and develop
mate preferences similar to their parents. This proposition was
Guo et al. 9
supported by the positive correlation between filial piety and
traditional mate preference. We further proposed that filial
piety should be negatively correlated with the preferences for
characteristics indicating genetic quality and traits related to
romantic love. However, using the items in the research instru-
ments in this study, we failed to construct a reliable scale
measuring the preference for genetic quality and the preference
for traits related to romantic love. A future study is encouraged
to address this issue using items developed in recent literature
(e.g., Apostolou, 2015b; Chang, Lu, & Zhu, 2017).
Another limitation is that this study was conducted only in
Chinese culture setting, leaving in-law and mate preferences
not being directly compared in other collectivist cultures, such
as Africa, Arab countries, India, and Spanish-speaking coun-
tries (Schwartz et al., 2010). Future work needs to replicate
these findings in different samples and in different cultural
settings. Furthermore, in this study, filial piety only showed a
rather limited power in predicting parent­child convergence in
mate preferences. One reason may be that the FPS (Ho, 1994)
used in this study only measures filial belief, which might
rarely be reflected in actual behaviors (Chow & Chu, 2007).
Another reason is that filial piety may be a multidimensional
construct (Yeh & Bedford, 2003, 2004). Future researchers are
expected to explore whether multidimensional filial piety
construct can better predict the parent­child agreement over
mating. Additionally, findings in this study were based on
self-report data, we are not sure whether filial piety can reduce
parent­offspring divergence in real-life situations. Future
naturalistic studies may overcome this limitation.
Previous literature also suggests that mate values of an indi-
vidual who excises mate selection also influence the mate pre-
ferences of that individual and his or her parents (Apostolou,
2011; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsenmeier, 2002). Future stud-
ies should take into account mate values of an individual (e.g.,
physical attractiveness, height, health, income, social status,
education, and personality) and those of his or her parents when
examining parent­child convergence and divergence over
mating (Chang et al., 2017). Social­economic status and size
of a family also influence the parents' ability to invest into their
child and grandchildren (Lawson & Mace, 2010). These factors
are recommended to be included in future studies.
This is the first study that directly compared in-law and mate
preferences in Chinese culture, illustrating how parent­child
disagreement over mating could be handled in a culturally
specific way. In China and probably other collectivist societies,
children are socialized to adopt and internalize parental prefer-
ences, resulting in low level of divergence in mate and in-law
preferences. More specifically, traditional culture values
(e.g., filial piety) can handle the parent­child disagreement
over mating that arises from diverging genetic interests in a
way that it does not escalate.
