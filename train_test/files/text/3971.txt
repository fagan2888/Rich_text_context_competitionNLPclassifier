Introduction
Diabetes-induced macro- and microvascular complica-
tions are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in
diabetic patients. Based on current trends, the rising inci-
dence of diabetes (expected to reach 700
million people
worldwide by 2025) will undoubtedly equate to increased
cardiovascular mortality.1 Diabetic patients have a much
more widespread and aggressive form of atherosclerosis
and, therefore, higher risk for myocardial infarction,
peripheral vascular disease and stroke, but the molecular
mechanisms leading to accelerated damage are still
unclear.2,3

cium/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor nuclear

Abstract
Aims: Despite vast clinical experience linking diabetes and atherosclerosis, the molecular mechanisms leading to
accelerated vascular damage are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of nuclear factor of activated T-cells
inhibition on plaque burden in a novel mouse model of type 2 diabetes that better replicates human disease.
Methods & Results: IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice were generated by crossbreeding low-density lipoprotein receptor­
deficient mice that synthesize only apolipoprotein B100 (LDLR­/­ApoB100/100) with transgenic mice overexpressing
insulin-like growth factor-II in pancreatic  cells. Mice have mild hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia and develop
complex atherosclerotic lesions. In vivo treatment with the nuclear factor of activated T-cells blocker A-285222 for
4
weeks reduced atherosclerotic plaque area and degree of stenosis in the brachiocephalic artery of IGF-II/LDLR­/­
ApoB100/100 mice, as assessed non-invasively using ultrasound biomicroscopy prior and after treatment, and histologically
after termination. Treatment had no impact on plaque composition (i.e. muscle, collagen, macrophages). The reduced
plaque area could not be explained by effects of A-285222 on plasma glucose, insulin or lipids. Inhibition of nuclear factor
of activated T-cells was associated with increased expression of atheroprotective NOX4 and of the anti-oxidant enzyme
catalase in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells.
Conclusion: Targeting the nuclear factor of activated T-cells signalling pathway may be an attractive approach for the
treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications.

factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) as a potential mediator
of vascular disease in the context of hyperglycaemia.
NFAT is expressed in the vascular wall and is readily acti-
vated by modest elevations of extracellular glucose in con-
duit4 and medium-sized resistance arteries5 as well as in
the microvasculature.6 Once activated, NFAT induces the
expression of the pro-atherogenic cytokine osteopontin
(OPN) in the arterial wall, as well as the expression of
inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-
2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
(VCAM-1), tissue factor (TF) and allograft inflammatory
factor-1 (AIF-1).4,7­11 Clinical and experimental studies
have implicated all these NFAT-targets in the development
of vascular disease.4,7­11 More recently, we showed that in
vivo treatment of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic
female ApoE­/­ mice with the NFAT blocker A-285222 for
4weeks abrogated- hyperglycaemia induced atherosclero-
sis in the aorta.10
A large number of studies over the past years have
focused on the generation of oxidative stress as the patho-
genic mechanism linking diabetes to atherosclerosis.12 A
shift in the balance between oxidant [i.e. reactive oxygen
and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS)] and anti-oxidant or
detoxifying agents [i.e. catalase and glyoxalase I (GLO1)]
results in chronically elevated oxidative stress levels in
diabetes.13 Key players in the generation of ROS in the
arterial wall are the vascular isoforms of the NADPH oxi-
dase (NOX) family of proteins.14 In particular, NOX1 and
NOX2 have been shown to be induced and promote ath-
erosclerosis in the context of diabetes, while NOX4 has
recently emerged as an atheroprotective isoform in both
humans and in mouse.15,16 Interestingly, in mouse kidney
fibroblasts, the calcineurin/NFAT pathway has been shown
to regulate NOX expression and activity in response to
high glucose.17
Here, we investigated whether inhibition of NFAT had
any impact on atherosclerosis in the context of type 2 dia-
betes, using a novel mouse model with a metabolic profile
and plaque characteristics that better mimic human disease
than other mouse models currently available.18 Moreover,
we explore the potential link between NFAT signalling and
oxidative stress in this setting.
Methods
Animals
IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice were originated by
crossbreeding low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor­
deficient mice expressing only apolipoprotein B100
(LDLR­/­ApoB100/100; C57BL/6x129/SvJae background)
with C57BL6/SJL mice overexpressing IGF-II in pan-
creatic -cells.19 Mice were either bred at the National
Laboratory Animal Centre at the University of Eastern
Finland or at Taconic Europe (Ejby, Denmark) after
re-derivation from the University of Eastern Finland.
Mice are characterized by hyperglycaemia, mild hyper-
insulinaemia, a human-like hypercholesterolaemic lipid
profile, and advanced and complex atherosclerotic
lesions, hence representing a model that better replicates
human disease and a more appropriate model for the
study of macrovascular complications in the context of
type 2 diabetes.19 Animals were housed in groups and
maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle. This study was
carried out in strict accordance with the recommenda-
tions in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All proto-
cols were approved by the local ethics review board
at Lund University and Malmö/Lund Animal Care
and Use Committee (M29-12; M9-15), and by the
National Animal Experiment Board in Finland
(ESAVI-2012-001260).
Study protocol
The study protocol was carried out twice and referred to
as Study I and Study II throughout the article (Figure
1(a)). Study I: Young (15­16weeks old, N=30) IGF-II/
LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice bred at Taconic Europe were
used at Lund University. Study II: Young (10weeks old,
N=10) and old (46­74weeks old, N=17) IGF-II/LDLR­
/­ApoB100/100 mice were bred and used at the University
of Eastern Finland. Mice at Lund University, but not at
the University of Eastern Finland were housed in indi-
vidually ventilated cages. All animals were fed ad libitum
and switched from a normal chow to high fat Western diet
(TD 88137, Harlan Tekland: 42% of calories from fat and
0.15% from cholesterol) at the start of the experiments.
After 4
weeks on high-fat diet, mice were randomized
based on blood glucose, body weight and plasma choles-
terol to receive daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of
the NFAT blocker A-285222 (0.29mg/kg body weight) or
vehicle (saline) for an additional 4
weeks. In Study II,
brachiocephalic artery plaque size measured by ultra-
sound biomicroscopy (see below) before the start of
A-285222 treatment was also included as parameter in
the randomization. A-285222 inhibits all NFAT family
members and was kindly provided byAbbott Laboratories
(Abbott Park, IL). This drug belongs to a series of 3,5-bis
(trifluoromethyl) pyrazole (BTP) derivatives demon-
strated to maintain NFAT in a phosphorylated state,
blocking its nuclear import and subsequent transcription,
without affecting NF-kB or AP-1 activation, or calcineu-
rin phosphatase activity.20 Body weight, fasting (16
h)
and non-fasting venous blood glucose (saphenous or tail
vein) were measured using Contour Glucometer (Bayer)
before, during and at termination of the experiments. All
fluid and tissue processing and analyses for both studies
304 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 15(4)
I and II were done at Lund University to avoid inter-lab
variability.
Ultrasound measurements
Brachiocephalic artery plaque size and lesion progression
were assessed non-invasively using ultrasound biomicros-
copy as previously described and validated21,22 (Vevo2100,
Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada), with a transducer fre-
quency of 40MHz (providing a theoretical resolution of
40µm at a frame rate of 32Hz). Prior to the scan, animals
were anaesthetized with isoflurane (4.5% isoflurane 450mL
air for induction, 2% isoflurane 200
mL air for mainte-
nance; Baxter International Inc., IL, USA). The brachioce-
phalic artery was visualized in a cross-sectional short axis
view and atherosclerotic lesion size was measured within
the proximal 200
µm from its bifurcation from the aortic
arch. All measurements were performed blinded by one
operator (intra-individual coefficient of variance
=
2.7%).
Loops of at least 100 frames were stored and the frame with
the largest plaque was chosen for off-line, blinded measure-
ments. At the end of the experimental protocol, mice were

anaesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine
(i.p.; 7.5
mg and 2.5
mg/100
g body weight, respectively)
and euthanized by exsanguination through cardiac puncture
for blood collection and perfused with phosphate-buffered
saline before tissue harvesting. Depth of anaesthesia was
assessed by toe-pinch procedure and absence of muscular
tone. All efforts were made to minimize suffering.
Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin and
OPN measurements
Total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels were
measured in overnight fasting blood samples before and
after treatment by colorimetric assays (InfinityTM-
Cholesterol and InfinityTM-Triglyceride; Thermo
Scientific, Middletown, VA, USA). Plasma insulin and
OPN were determined after overnight fasting at the end of
the treatment using Mercodia mouse insulin enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Mercodia AB,
Uppsala, Sweden) and Quantikine mouse OPN ELISA kit
(R&D Systems, Abingdon UK), respectively. All assays
were performed according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions and the lower limits of detection were 0.2
µg/L for
insulin and 5.7pg/mL for OPN.
Histological evaluations of plaque size and
plaque composition
Brachiocephalic arteries and hearts were immersion-fixed
with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.4) and
thereafter embedded in paraffin. Plaque and media con-
tents of smooth muscle, collagen and elastin were evalu-
ated in cross-sections (5
µm) stained with haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), as well as with Elastin van Gieson
(EvG). Plaque macrophage contents were evaluated both
in cross-sections (5µm) of the brachiocephalic artery and
of the subvalvular region of the aortic root, using rat anti-
MOMA-2 (monocytes/macrophage 2) primary antibody
(1
µg/mL, BMA Biomedicals, Augst, Switzerland), bioti-
nylated rabbit anti-rat secondary IgG antibody (1:70,
BA-40011, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and
immPACT-DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
for visualization. No staining was detected when primary
or secondary antibodies were omitted from the protocols.
Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin.
Plaque and media areas (mm2), degree of stenosis and
media thickness (µm) were measured under blinded condi-
tions using computer-aided morphometry (BioPix iQ2.3.1
software, Biopix AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Stenosis is
expressed as the percentage of area within the internal
elastic lamina occupied by atherosclerotic plaque. For
media thickness, tiff-files were imported into NIS Elements
BR Analysis 3.2 64-bit software and a wheel (Rose binary)
grid with 16 spokes was centred in the lumen. An average
of the media thickness measured at each of the 16 posi-
tions where the spokes met the media was calculated.
Cell culture
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were obtained by
outgrowth from aorta explants from BalB/c NFATc3­/­ and
wild-type (WT; NFATc3+/+) mice23 as previously
described.8 Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with ketamine
hydrochloride and xylazine (i.p.; 7.5
mg and 2.5
mg/100
g
body weight, respectively) and euthanized by cervical dis-
location. After reaching confluence, VSMCs (passages
10­15) were seeded in 24-well plates (7.5×104 cells/well)
and cultured for 24h in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) containing 5
mmol/L d-glucose and supple-
mented with 10% FBS before stimulations. Hydrogen per-
oxide (H2
O2
, 500
µmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt,
Germany) or 3-Morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride
(SIN-1, 100
µmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to induce
oxidative stress. After stimulation, cells were harvested for
gene expression analyses. Oxidative stress levels were
measured in culture media using OxiSelectTM In Vitro ROS/
RNS Assay Kit (Cells Biolab, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. H2
O2
levels
were determined in culture medium using Amplex Red
Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit [Molecular
probes, Eugene, OR, USA] in VSMCs cultured as above or
in human microvascular endothelial cells [HMEC-1,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Emory
University] cultured in M200 medium supplemented with
low serum growth supplement (LSGS).
RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from intact, snap-frozen aortas
from IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice using TRI Reagent
BD (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or from cultured
VSMCs using RNeasy® Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
cDNA synthesis (RevertAid M-MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase; Fermentas GMBH, St Leon-Rot, Germany)
and real-time PCR were performed as previously described24

Results
In vivo inhibition of NFAT effectively leads to
plaque regression in the brachiocephalic artery
of IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice
Histological evaluation of the brachiocephalic arteries of
young mice revealed reduced plaque area and degree of
stenosis after 4weeks of treatment with the NFAT blocker
A-285222 (Figure 1(b) to (d)). The effects of the blocker
were significant in the males only (Figure 1(b) to (d)). The
same pattern was observed in Study I and II (Supplemental
Figure 1(A) and (B)). No significant differences in media
area or thickness were observed after NFAT inhibition
(Supplemental Figure 1(C) to (H)). Male IGF-II/LDLR­/­
ApoB100/100 mice exhibited larger atherosclerotic plaques
than female mice. Interestingly, despite being younger,
male mice in Study II had considerably larger plaques
than males in Study I, maybe due to different breeding or
housing environments.
Non-invasive longitudinal ultrasound measurements in
Study II revealed that the effects of NFAT inhibition on
atherosclerosis may not only be due to limited plaque
progression but also to plaque regression, as evidenced by
smaller plaque size after treatment with A-285222 when
compared to plaque size in the same mice before treatment
(Figure 1(e) and (f)). Ultrasound experiments also showed
significantly smaller brachiocephalic artery plaque size in
mice treated with A-285222 when compared to control
mice (Figure 1(e)), in line with the histological results.
The reduction in plaque size was unlikely due to lower-
ing effects of A-285222 on plasma glucose, cholesterol or
triglyceride levels, since these were not significantly
reduced by the treatment (Table 1). In male mice, we even
observed a small elevation in fasting blood glucose in the
A-285222 treated group (Table 1), which would instead
counteract any beneficial effect of the NFAT blocker. We
have seen a similar effect of the NFAT blocker on blood
glucose in STZ-induced diabetic BalB/c mice: an effect
that was no longer evident after lowering the dose of
A-285222 from 0.29 to 0.15mg/kg.4 We have not observed
this effect in other diabetic mouse models or strains.10 This
could potentially be attributed to direct effects ofA-285222
on pancreatic -cells, where the involvement of NFAT in
the regulation of insulin transcription is well established.25
This effect was only evident under fasting conditions and
no effects on plasma insulin or body weight were detected
after treatment with A-285222 (Table 1). Male mice had
higher body weight than female mice and higher plasma

triglycerides: this last, potentially contributing to their
larger atherosclerotic plaques (Table 1).
We also evaluated if inhibition of NFAT had any impact
on plaque composition, but we did not detect any differences
in plaque muscle, collagen or macrophage contents after
treatment with A-285222 in Study I (Figure 2(a) to (d)). No
significant differences were observed regarding media mus-
cle, collagen or elastin contents (Figure 2(a) and (e) to (g)).

Similarly, no significant differences were observed when
corresponding measurements were performed in vessels
from Study II (Supplemental Figure 2).
In vivo inhibition of NFAT signalling induces
changes in the expression of oxidative stress
and inflammatory targets in the arterial wall of
IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice
In agreement with previous work, both NOX2 and NOX4
were expressed in mouse aorta.16 Treatment with the NFAT
blocker A-285222 for 4
weeks significantly increased the
expression of the atheroprotective isoform NOX4 in the
aorta of male mice (Figure 3(a)), while changes in NOX2
were not significant (Figure 3(b)). We also examined the
expression of the detoxifier protein glyoxalase I (GLO1),
which metabolizes methylglyoxal (MG), a major source of
intracellular and plasmatic advanced glycation end prod-
uct (AGE) formation, into the unreactive d-lactate. But
neither changes in GLO1 expression (Figure 3(c)) nor in
the expression of another detoxifier enzyme, catalase
(Figure 3(d)), were significant. Consistent with results
obtained in our previous studies in which STZ-induced
diabeticApoE­/­ femalemiceweretreatedwithA-285222,10
expression of the macrophage marker CD68 was signifi-
cantly reduced by NFAT inhibition in the aortas of IGF-II/
LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 female mice (Figure 3(e)), along with
tendencies to reduced IL-6 and OPN (Figure 3(f) to (g)). In
line with previous studies,10 plasma OPN was not affected
by treatment with A-285222 (Table 1), suggesting the
effects of the blocker are targeted to the vessel wall and not
due to lower systemic inflammation.
The analysis of the expression data also revealed
sex-dependent differences in the IGF-II/LDLR­/­
ApoB100/100 model, as assessed in the aortas of vehicle
treated mice. Levels of NOX2 were relatively higher in
males than in females, while arteries from female mice
expressed relatively higher levels of atheroprotective
NOX4, catalase and GLO1 (Supplemental Figure 3):
maybe underlying the differences in overall plaque bur-
den observed between sexes (Supplemental Figure 1(A)
and (B)).
NFAT modulates the expression of NOX4
and catalase in a powerful oxidative stress
environment
Next, we explored whether inhibition of NFAT could alter
the expression of oxidative stress related genes in VSMCs
cultured under controlled oxidative stress conditions.
VSMCs were incubated either with hydrogen peroxide
(H2
O2
; 500
µmol/L) or with peroxynitrite donor 3-mor-
pholinosydnonimine (SIN-1; 100
µmol/L) for 48
h to
induce oxidative stress, in the presence or absence of
A-285222 (1
µmol/L). Figure 4 shows that inhibition of

stress targets (a) NOX4, (b) NOX2, (c) GLO1 and (d) catalase,
as well as inflammatory targets (e) CD68, (f) IL-6 and (g) OPN
were quantified by qPCR in the aortas of young IGF-II/LDLR­
/­ApoB100/100 mice from Study I and II. HPRT and -actin were
used as endogenous controls and data were expressed relative
to each control group. N=5 and 7 for control and treated males,
respectively; N=8 for female groups.

NFAT effectively increased expression of NOX4 in
VSMCs exposed to H2
O2
and of catalase in VSMCs
exposed to SIN-1, suggesting involvement of NFAT in the
modulation of these genes under strong oxidative stress
conditions. Inhibition of NFAT with A-285222 had no
impact on H2
O2
levels measured during culture of VSMCs
or endothelial cells (Figure 4(c)). Interestingly, ROS/RNS
levels are significantly lower in the culture medium of
VSMCs from NFATc3 knockout (NFATc3­/­) mice cul-
tured in high glucose (25

In vivo inhibition of NFAT signalling in old IGF-
II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice have modest effects
on plaque size
Treatmentofoldermicefor4weekswithA-285222(0.29mg/
kg) resulted in reduced histologically assessed plaque area
only in female mice (Figure 5(a)). This smaller plaque size
was not translated in a significantly larger arterial lumen
(Figure 5(b)). We were not able to detect differences in
plaque size by ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 5(c) and
(d)), maybe due to the lower sensitivity of the method when
compared to histology. Old IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice
had significantly lower macrophage infiltration in subvalvu-
lar aortic plaques than young mice, as expected to be the case
during later phases of the atherogenic process (Figure 5(e)
and (f)), but higher circulating levels of OPN (222
±70ng/
mL and 185±42ng/mL for males and females, respectively;
Supplemental Table 1) reflecting increased plasma inflam-
matory burden when ageing.
Despite reduced expression of CD68 in the aortas of
younger mice (Figure 3(e)), treatment with A-285222 did
not translate into reduced macrophage infiltration in sub-
valvular plaques regardless the age of the mice (Figure
5(e)). This lack of effect at the level of the aortic root is in
line with previous data in diabetic ApoE­/­ mice.10
Treatment with the NFAT blocker had no impact on elastin
or collagen contents in the subvalvular plaques (data not
shown) or on elastin and collagen contents or vessel mor-
phometry in the brachiocephalic arteries (Supplemental
Figure 4). No significant differences in gene expression
were found in the aortas of older mice treated with
A-285222 when compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure
5(g) and (h)). In line with findings in the young mice, no
significant effects on body weight or on metabolic param-
eters that could explain changes in plaque size were found
after treatment with A-285222 (Supplemental Table 1).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that inhibition of NFAT signalling
in IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice reduces atherosclero-
sis in the brachiocephalic artery, a particularly disease-
prone vascular segment in mice, independently of changes
in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid levels. This may not
only be due to limited plaque progression but also due to
plaque regression, as evidenced in the ultrasound biomi-
croscopy experiments by smaller plaque size after treat-
ment with A-285222 when compared to plaque size in the
same mice before treatment. These findings are in line
with previous work from our laboratory showing abroga-
tion of diabetes-induced aggravation of atherosclerosis in
the aortic arch of STZ-induced diabetic ApoE­/­ mice. This
study goes beyond a toxin-induced type 1 diabetes model
and supports a role for NFAT in the development of athero-
sclerosis in the context of type 2 diabetes and in an animal
model that better replicates human disease than the STZ
model.
Experimental models of atherosclerosis and diabetes are
very susceptible to the housing environment, often translating
into differences in the severity of the disease phenotype (i.e.
atherosclerotic plaque size, degree of hyperglycaemia) when
the same strain is studied in different animal facilities.18 This
issue adds to the complexity of using animal models in medi-
cal research, potentially having an impact on study results and
their interpretation, and to some extent, contributing to the
poor translation of preclinical in vivo results into successful
clinical trials and higher approval rates of new drug candi-
dates. Among other explanations for this limited translational
value [e.g. shortcomings in the design of clinical trials, over-
optimistic conclusions from methodologically flawed animal
studies, animal models that do not reflect human disease
(reviewed in Van der Worp et al.26)] is the fact that validation
studies are not traditionally conducted in the animal experi-
mental field (when it is an absolute requirement for all other
steps leading to the establishment of new therapies). A
strength of this study is that the inhibitory effect of the NFAT
blocker on atherosclerosis was replicated in two independent
mice cohorts undergoing the same experimental protocol at
different animal facilities.
Plaque size is the preferred primary readout in animal
models and is typically determined histologically at the
end of the experiments. Advances in ultrasound techniques
have made possible the measurement of plaque progres-
sion/regression non-invasively in rodents, allowing for
longitudinal studies which help reduce the number of ani-
mals required for statistical power. At termination, com-
plementary evaluations of plaque area have shown good
correlation between the histological and the non-invasive
measurements in the brachiocephalic artery, the aorta and
carotid arteries.22,27 Here, we also found a good correlation
between the two techniques in the brachiocephalic arteries
of young mice but were not able to dissect the histological
difference in plaque size observed in the old female mice
(Figure 5), probably because the effect size of the NFAT
blocker was smaller in older mice than in younger mice
and due to lower number of mice in the older cohort.
Nevertheless, ultrasound biomicroscopy should be consid-
ered as an attractive non-invasive method to assess the
effects of interventions in rodents.
In the ApoE-deficient mouse, it is well established that
atherosclerotic lesions progress with age through all
phases of atherogenesis, from monocyte adhesion, then
lipid deposition and formation of fatty streaks to more
mature and fibrous plaques;28,29 and that the pace at which
this happens can vary depending on the vascular segment
(e.g. more advanced lesions in the aortic root vs the
aortic arch;10 slowest progressing lesions in the coronary
arteries29). Our previous work highlighted differential
susceptibility to STZ-induced atherosclerosis depending
312 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 15(4)
on the age of the lesions, with more pronounced effects
of hyperglycaemia on plaque size in early stage lesions,
such as those in the aortic arch, when compared to the
effects on more advanced plaques such as those in the
aortic root.10 In line with NFAT being activated by hyper-
glycaemia as we previously established,4,5 the effects of
A-285222 had a more distinct impact on the aortic arch
than on the aortic root of STZ-diabetic ApoE­/­ mice,
stressing the need for a diabetes-driven process for NFAT-
inhibition to play a role.10 Here, we found in the IGF-II/
LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice, a model in which the extent
and severity of the lesions progress with age,19 a clear
effect of A-285222 in the younger cohorts but only mod-
est effects of NFAT-inhibition in the older mice (Figure 1
vs 5). Young mice exhibited more dynamic lesions char-
acterized by an active inflammatory process with higher
degree of macrophage infiltration than old mice (Figure
5(e) and (f)). It is possible that the reduction in plaque
size observed after inhibition of NFAT signalling could
be, at least in part, driven by reduced inflammation. Even
though the proportion of the plaque occupied by mac-
rophages was not affected by A-285222 treatment (Figure
2(d)), the reduction in plaque size observed in the males
inevitably translated into reduced total macrophage con-
tent (from 7474±2497µm2 to 2239±939µm2 in males,
p=0.08).
IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice included in this study
have elevated fasting blood glucose levels in line with
previously reported values;19,30,31 however, they exhibited
only moderate non-fasting hyperglycaemia compared to
the values originally reported when the model was gener-
ated (~16mmol/L)19. This discrepancy could be attributed
to genetic drift, which should not be neglected even in
inbred strains. The combination of impaired glucose toler-
ance and impaired fasting glucose31 makes the IGF-II/
LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice a relevant model of pre-diabe-
tes, a condition associated with higher risk of developing
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In previous
work, we showed a clear dose-dependency of glucose-
induced NFAT transcriptional activity, with modest eleva-
tions of a few mmol/L of extracellular glucose being
sufficient for significant NFATc3 activation in the arterial
wall.5 In light of this dose-dependency and the need of a
hyperglycaemia-driven process to occur for NFAT-
inhibition to have effects, it was reasonable to find that the
same treatment with A-285222 had a more profound
inhibitory effect on the expression of inflammatory mark-
ers in the aorta of STZ-diabetic ApoE­/­ mice (a model
characterized by profound hyperglycaemia) than of
IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice with their milder hyper-
glycaemic phenotype.
NOX4 has recently been shown to protect against
endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in LDLR defi-
cient mice.32 It was suggested that hydrogen peroxide
derived from NOX4 acted via pAKT1 phosphorylation on
eNOS activation. Here, we showed that inhibition of NFAT
signalling in VSMCs exposed to a strong oxidative stress
environment, significantly increased NOX4 expression
(Figure 4(a)). The cell experiments also suggest that the
observed upregulation of NOX4 expression in the aorta of
male IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice (Figure 3(a)) after
treatment with A-285222 could at least in part be due to
direct effects of the NFAT blocker on the vascular cells. A
similar NFAT-dependent regulation of NOX4 has been
demonstrated in immortalized human podocytes stimu-
lated with insulin using three complementary approaches
to inhibit NFAT-signalling (tacrolimus, cyclosporine A and
VIVIT peptide).33 Using another inducer of oxidative
stress (SIN-1), we also found that inhibition of NFAT sig-
nalling resulted in enhanced catalase expression in VSMCs
(Figure 4(b)).
This study shows that inhibition of NFAT signalling in
IGF-II/LDLR­/­ApoB100/100 mice not only limits the pro-
gression of atherosclerosis but, more importantly, it leads
to atherosclerosis plaque regression. The effects are not
due to changes in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid levels
but may be attributed to reduced inflammatory burden and
improved anti-oxidant defences such as NOX4 and cata-
lase. Vascular NFAT may be considered as a novel thera-
peutic target for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular
complications.
