Introduction
The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled
between 1980 and 2008. Statistics from the World Health
Organization (2013) showed that 34
per cent of men and
35
per cent of women were overweight (body mass index
(BMI)25kg/m2) and that 10per cent of men and 14per cent
of women were obese (BMI30kg/m2). In addition, Ogden
et al. (2006) showed that obesity provides a 30
per cent
greater contribution to childhood and adolescent mortality
rates than to the mortality rates of young and mature adults
(Biro and Wein, 2010).Although attention has been drawn to
this global epidemic and to obesity-related health concerns,
some obese people experience difficulty in losing weight
because of their failure to adhere to healthy diet and exercise
recommendations. Overweight and obese people who seek
to lose weight must change their lifestyles to improve their
energy balance. Energy balance can be improved by engag-
ing in regular physical activity and avoiding energy-dense
foods with low nutrient content (Kremers et al., 2006; Rey-
Lopez et al., 2008). However, weight reduction through life-
style modification has been difficult to foster in both
developed and developing countries (World Health
Organization, 2002). Studies have focused on weight-man-
agement motivation and cognitive­motivational factors such
as beliefs, attitudes and perceptions, which have been found
to influence the nutritional behaviour of obese people.
Behavioural mediator constructs have been developed on the
basis of several conceptual theories such as the health-belief
model (HBM), self-determination theory (SDT), social-cog-
nitive theory (SCT), transtheoretical model (TTM) and the-
ory of planned behaviour (TPB). Theory-based models are
designed to understand the cognitive psychology of a person
within the context of that person's social environment as well
as other constructs such as motivation and intentions (Nigg
et al., 2002). Theory-based interventions help people reflect
on their decisions and develop strong intentions to achieve
their target behaviour (Baranaowski et al., 1997; Goldstein
et al., 2004). These theories provide different theoretical per-
spectives on health-behaviour research. For example,
the HBM is described as a belief­attitude theory because it
comprises core beliefs for predicting the likelihood of a

Abstract
Weight reduction that corresponds with lifestyle modification is difficult to foster. The theory of planned behaviour has
been actively cited in explaining health-related behaviour. This review evaluated the application of the theory of planned
behaviour to weight-loss behaviour. Among the three reviewed papers, cross-sectional survey designs and subjective
outcome measurements were commonly applied. All of the studies recruited obese female adults as participants, limiting
the generalisability of the studies' findings. The theory of planned behaviour can be effectively applied in weight-reduction
programmes targeting female obese patients. This review confirmed critiques citing the limitations of experimental
studies, the subjective measurement of behaviour and short follow-up periods.

behavioural occurrence. The model proposes that the likeli-
hood of a person performing a health-related action is moti-
vated by a series of perceptions (e.g. perceived severity,
perceived susceptibility, perceived threat or risk, perceived
benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and cues to action).
SCT is described as a competence-based theory because it
specifies the factors of a person required for acquiring com-
petencies that can influence physical and emotional well-
being and the self-regulation of health habits (Bandura,
1998). Control-based theories such as the SDT concern the
psychological needs for autonomy, competence and related-
ness. SDT suggests that the motivation of self-initiated
behaviour is based on the satisfaction of these basic psycho-
logical needs and support from the social environment (Ryan
and Deci, 2000). The TTM is considered a decision-making
theory and suggests that health-behaviour adoption and
maintenance occurs at discrete stages within a process
(Biddle and Nigg, 2000). SCTs such as the TPB, however,
focus on how likely it is that individuals intend to engage in
a behaviour. Intention is considered the ultimate mediator of
behaviour, and Armitage and Conner (2001) found that
reported intentions were reliably and moderately correlated
with certain health actions.
In early studies examining health promotion and disease
prevention, SCT was described and appraised as a more
comprehensive approach with a broader range of sociocog-
nitive determinants compared with other theories such as
the HBM and TPB (Bandura, 1998). SCT is useful, but
places emphasis on collective support, which is sometimes
beyond the control of an individual. This emphasis limits
SCT application, especially in studies focusing on self-
influence rather than a sense of support. The HBM's con-
structs are broadly used in health studies. However, the
HBM is under conceptual critique; specifically, the opera-
tional definitions of its constructs are not clear, making
comparison among studies difficult (Abraham and Sheeran,
2005). Although this model can predict behaviour signifi-
cantly, the effects are usually small (Sheeran and Abraham,
1996). By contrast, the TPB was found to be economical
compared with the HBM, which has more constructs and
items stemming from its various constructs (Sutton, 1998).
The TPB facilitates explaining the determinants of a per-
son's intention to change one's food choices and nutritional
behaviour (Contento, 2011). The TPB includes perceived
behavioural control (PBC) as a construct to accommodate
people's volitional control. However, controversies arise
over the distinction between self-efficacy and PBC. Norman
and Hoyle (2004) suggested that people with a strong sense
of self-efficacy are likely to perform a target behaviour and
used PBC as proxy measure of behavioural control over
environmental constraints. Studies have related self-effi-
cacy and PBC to exercise and dietary behaviours, support-
ing the separation of these two constructs (Armitage and
Connor, 1999; Terry and O'Leary, 1995). In contrast to the
TTM, which assumes that people move through discrete
stages in the preparation and execution of behavioural
change, the TPB is regarded as a continuous model (Lippke
et al., 2005). The constructs of the TPB and TTM share
common conceptual similarities and some of them overlap.
For example, the construct of attitude in the TPB was found
to entail individual beliefs regarding decisional balance
(Kosma et al., 2007), and the stage of change in the TTM is
reflected by intention followed by behavioural change in
the TPB. Therefore, Yoo (2009) suggested that self-efficacy
and attitude be integrated with PBC and decisional balance,
respectively. Nevertheless, the TPB's unique construct of
social influence was found to be absent from the TTM
(Yoo, 2009). Evidence shows that approximately two-thirds
of TPB-based interventions (Hardeman et al., 2002) and 13
of 17 HBM-based interventions exerted significant impacts
on health behaviours (Abraham and Sheeran, 2005).
Regarding the balance between advantages and disadvan-
tages, the TPB seems to be more parsimonious and efficient
in its use of constructs and, therefore, has been applied fre-
quently in predicting health behaviour.
TPB
The TPB is an extended form of the theory of reasoned
action (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980) and was developed to
predict behavioural change on the basis of cognitive com-
ponents (Ajzen, 1988, 1991). The TPB reveals the under-
lying actions and motivations for behavioural change by
emphasising the value of establishing strong intentions
through attitudes, normative beliefs and perceived control.
Determinants of changes in attitude, subjective norms and
greater perceived control predict intention and thereby
promote health-related behaviour (Armitage and Conner,
2001; Godin and Kok, 1996). The TPB considers behav-
iour a goal achieved by a group of participants. The media-
tor of behaviour is intention, which is the perceived
likelihood that an action is performed to achieve a targeted
behaviour. According to the theory, attitude refers to a per-
son's positive or negative judgement of the intended
approach. A subjective norm is applied to the approval or
disapproval of the participant group to achieve the targeted
behaviour. Finally, a person's PBC provides evidence of
his or her control over the environmental barriers that
require changing. These three mediators have been used to
determine the potential contributing influence of certain
established factors. For example, whereas behavioural
beliefs and outcome evaluation are bases for predicting
attitude, normative beliefs and the motivation to comply
are the foundations for projecting subjective norms, and
control belief is the major correlate to PBC. The TPB has
been cited frequently (Ajzen, 2011) and widely adopted to
explain health-related behaviour such as smoking, mam-
mography screening, voluntary HIV counselling and test-
ing, exercise, food choice, family meal frequency and fruit
and vegetable intake (Abamecha et al., 2013; Carter-Parker
Chung and Fong 3
et al., 2012; Eto et al., 2011; Fila and Smith, 2006; Griva
et al., 2013; Lohse et al., 2011; Shepherd, 1999). However,
Gardner and Hausenblas (2005) critiqued the theory as
unviable for predicting exercise and diet behaviour in a
group of overweight women. Recently, the TPB, despite
being applied in numerous correlational studies and indi-
cating prospective associations between cognitions and
behaviour (Noar and Zimmerman, 2005), has been dis-
missed because of its limited predictive validity and utility
in robust studies (Sniehotta et al., 2014). Through a sys-
tematic review, McEachan et al. (2011) found that the
strongest TPB predictor was the construct of intention,
which exhibited a variability of 19.3
per cent regarding
health behaviour. This 19.3
per cent variability, based on
237 prospective studies, was considered low. Other criti-
cisms addressed the TPB's `shortitudinal' instead of longi-
tudinal designs in application, insufficiency in predicting
behaviour and small effect sizes of behavioural change,
particularly when the studies reported behaviour over a
long period (Sniehotta et al., 2014). In addition, self-
reported outcome measures and rare experimental designs
were found (Sniehotta et al., 2014). These findings elicit
concerns over whether an intervention can be developed
according to the TPB and whether the theory can provide
effective techniques for translating cognitive change into
behavioural change (Sniehotta, 2009). These findings also
raise the question of whether the TPB can be applied in
designing and developing intervention methods for weight-
reduction programmes.
Because effective and sustainable weight loss stems from
a change in lifestyle, investigating whether the TPB facilitates
weight loss is valuable to health psychologists. The TPB is
newer than other health theories. Because of increasing evi-
dence regarding its effectiveness and ineffectiveness, identi-
fying potential determinants of weight reduction in existing
literature is crucial. In preparation for clinical trials on how to
achieve sustainable weight loss, this review evaluated recent
applications of the TPB to weight-loss behaviour.
Methods
Search strategies
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adopted in a
systematic and structural search of the literature (Moher
et al., 2009). We searched original research articles written
in English and published between 1980 (when the TPB was
first theorised and published by Ajzen and Fishbein) and
March 2013. The databases used for the literature searches
were PsycINFO, Cochrane, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed
and ScienceDirect. The search keywords included `weight
loss', `weight reduction', `body mass index', `weight con-
trol' and `obesity'. Bibliographies of relevant studies were
examined to identify additional studies. A `grey' literature
search of other databases such as Google Scholar was con-
ducted to identify additional relevant studies.
Selection criteria
For inclusion in this review, studies were required to (1) be
original, (2) use primary data sources, (3) apply interven-
tions to determine the effects of the TPB on weight loss and
(4) accept all age groups. Because this review focused on
the effect of TPB interventions on weight reduction, arti-
cles having clear operational definitions for outcome vari-
ables relevant to weight reduction were included.
Definitions of outcome measurements, namely, body
weight, body circumference, body fat percentage and BMI,
were included. Because this review focused on interven-
tions based on the TPB framework, papers that used the
HBM, the precaution-adoption process model and SDT
were excluded. Unpublished studies and conference papers
were also excluded because of the difficulties involved in
locating the full papers. To ensure the quality of this review,
non-peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded.
Review analysis
Data extracted from studies applying the TPB as an interven-
tion for weight reduction and meeting the aforementioned
criteria were tabulated for further analysis. The data extracted
included the source of the study, study design, study sample,
outcome measurements, instruments and results.
Results
In total, 14 studies were identified through database searches
(Figure 1). Studies that tested theories on binge eating
(Porzelius et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1995) or weight loss in
a hospital setting (Rodgers and Brawley, 1993) were
excluded. After manual screening, 11 papers were prelimi-
narily selected. One of these papers was ultimately excluded
because it focused on the `maintenance of weight loss'
rather than `weight loss or reduction' (McConnon et al.,
2011). The paper also explored the cognition underlying
weight regain, which was not the defined behaviour exam-
ined in this review. New extensions of the TPB, such as self-
representation, need perception and moral norms, have been
advanced by various studies (Abraham and Sheeran, 2000;
Payne et al., 2004; Raats et al., 1995), but were excluded
from the scope of this review. In addition to its focus on
need perception as a new TPB extension, the study by Payne
et al. (2004) was excluded because it evaluated exercise and
diet adherence as behavioural outcomes and, therefore,
deviated from weight loss as a targeted outcome.Among the
seven remaining studies, four related to obesity were finally
excluded (Table 1). In these four studies, obese or over-
weight participants were recruited as participants. Plotnikoff
(2013) identified physical activity as the targeted behaviour,
4 Health Psychology Open 
and the TPB constructs that resulted were significantly asso-
ciated with physical activity levels among overweight and
obese adolescents. Only the studies conducted by Gardner
et al. (2005) and Duangchan et al. (2010) addressed BMI as
a measured outcome. However, Gardner et al. examined
exercise and healthy eating behaviour instead of the objec-
tive parameters measured by BMI and the waist-to-hip ratio.
Although Duangchan et al. (2010) applied BMI as a weight-
loss measure, they did not consider the effect of the TPB on
weight reduction, but rather evaluated the effect of physical
activity and a healthy eating intervention programme into
which TPB constructs were incorporated.
Finally, only three papers that fit the inclusion criteria
for exploring TPB construct correlations and targeted
weight-reduction behaviour were found. The details on
these papers are summarised in Table 2.
Discussion
Although the TPB has been heavily applied in studies that
predict exercise and healthy eating habits, few of these
studies have addressed weight-reduction behaviour.
Healthy eating and physical activity are considered key ele-
ments in weight loss. However, studies thus far have been
predominantly cross-sectional rather than experimental. In
addition, correlation analysis of the major determinants of
overweight and obese groups (Gardner and Hausenblas,
2005; Schifter and Ajzen, 1985) has commonly been
applied in investigating the associations of TPB constructs
with weight-loss behaviour. Although it was statistically
reasonable to identify the correlates affecting the intention
to lose weight, we found that it was questionable whether
these associations could help obese participants lose
weight, especially when their behaviour was subjectively
measured according to their level of physical activity or
healthy eating. Furthermore, few of the studies measured
change in body weight as a true behavioural outcome
(Gardner and Hausenblas, 2013; Schifter and Ajzen, 1985).
Instead, participants were asked to report their expected
body weight or their intended weight loss in the near future.
The determinants of attitudes, subjective norms, PBC and
intention were analysed to predict the participants'expected
body weight, which could have been relevant to their
implementation plans. However, we also questioned

whether an expected body-weight change could reflect the
final weight-loss amount.
Objective outcome measurements
One of our critiques of current literature related to its sub-
jective measurement of weight reduction. This finding ech-
oed a recent challenge to the validity of the TPB regarding
the operationalisation of study measures (Sniehotta, 2009).
Certain studies have analysed anthropometric variables
(Gardner and Hausenblas, 2013; Schifter and Ajzen, 1985),
yet their designs have been limited regarding the correlation
of TPB determinants with weight status rather than weight
reduction specifically. By contrast, the three studies we con-
sidered in this review applied TPB determinants to explore
the differences in actual weight reduction during the
designed experimental period or applied TPB determinants
during an intervention to test their effectiveness in weight
reduction. The results of these studies'objective evaluations
of body weight supported theoretical model testing.
Major weight-reduction determinants
In parallel with previous studies, PBC (Palmeira et al.,
2007;SchifterandAjzen,1985)andintention(Luszczynska
et al., 2007; Schifter and Ajzen, 1985) were evidentially
supported as significant determinants of actual weight
loss. However, we discovered a conflict regarding whether
TPB attitudes contributed to actual weight loss. Schifter
and Ajzen (1985) reported a poor correlation between atti-
tude and final body-weight changes, whereas Palmeira
(2007) found attitude to be associated with body-weight
reduction. The high variance among individuals could
have accounted for these contrasting results (Armitage and
Connor, 2001; Schifter and Ajzen, 1985). We also ques-
tioned whether the various instruments used to measure
attitude influenced the validity of the findings regarding
weight reduction. Such misleading evidence has been
reported by other studies; specifically, attitude, subjective
norms and PBC were highly predictive of intentions,
which are correspondingly predictive of behaviour, in
cross-sectional studies, but the assumptions have not been
verified by experimental findings (Weinstein, 2007). This
critique prompts queries regarding whether weight-loss
behaviour corresponds with TPB assumptions and whether
attitude is a major determinant in the execution of weight-
reduction behaviour.
Generalisability of findings
All of the participants in the included studies were female.
Hence, we were cautious in interpreting their findings on
the effectiveness of applying the TPB in weight-manage-
ment programmes because their results were limited only to
overweight and obese female adults. This factor certainly
limited their implications and restricted the generalisability
of the findings to other populations, such as to obese male
adults. In addition, sampling was not conducted using well-
developed protocols for reducing sample bias. A test of
homogeneity could not be found; the lack of such tests
affects the extent to which this review substantiates the
quality of the included studies. In addition, the sample sizes
in the included studies were small with inadequate justifi-
cation. This factor also hampered our interpretation of their
findings regarding weight-loss behaviour as a function of
TPB attributes.
Limitations and recommendations
The TPB emerged in the mid-1980s. Although its theoreti-
cal framework has been influential in health-behaviour
studies, only a few studies have reported on the application
of the TPB to weight reduction; the determinants reviewed
here may not be sufficiently thorough to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the theory in modifying the behavioural inten-
tion of obese people attempting to lose weight. Scientific
evidence regarding weight-loss behaviour has been rela-
tively primitive (cross-sectional studies and self-reported
determinants). Additional quantitative studies, such as ran-
domised controlled trials and longitudinal studies, are
required to fill the current knowledge gap. In addition,
more studies that focus on populations other than obese
females would enrich the applicability of the TPB to weight
reduction. Only a representative inclusion of participants
can confirm the correlations of TPB constructs with weight-
reduction determinants.
Conclusion
The TPB effectively explains the ability of PBC and possi-
bly attitude to increase the intentions of obese females to
achieve superior weight-loss results. This review also con-
firmed critiques citing the limitations of TPB experimental
studies, namely, the subjective measurement of behaviour
and short follow-up periods.
Implications
The TPB has been shown to be a useful theoretical frame-
work for much health-related behaviour. The determinants
provide strong correlations in predicting desirable behav-
iours. Because obesity is related to a few metabolic syn-
dromes and chronic diseases, effective strategies to reduce
body weight are vital to promote. Interventions designed
and developed on the basis of the TPB can increase effec-
tiveness in achieving weight loss when the TPB shows a
positive correlation with actual weight loss. In this review,
the authors found that the evidence provided by the included
studies is limited and cannot be generalised to the general
