Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. The prevalence is 40% in groups
aged 40­59 years old according to a recent report from the
American Heart Association.1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) is a common risk factor of CVD, with studies
showing the risk of CVD higher in patients with T2DM
compared with those without.2 It has also been reported
that about 50% of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
patients have diabetes, with the risk of death of AMI with
diabetes 3-fold higher compared with AMI without diabe-
tes.3 The prevalence of T2DM has increased 30% between
2001 to 2009,1 and according to the International Diabetes
Federation, Kuwait is ranked third among the top 10
countries with highest diabetes prevalence worldwide.2
This is alarming, especially considering that the

Abstract
Background and objectives: The D allele of the common angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D gene polymorphism
(rs4646994) predisposes to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, results on
which allele predisposes to disease susceptibility remain controversial in Asian populations. This study was performed
to evaluate the association of the common ACE I/D gene polymorphism with both T2DM and CVD susceptibility in an
Arab population.
Methods: We genotyped the ACE I/D polymorphisms by direct allele-specific PCR in 183 healthy controls and 400 CVD
patients with diabetes (n=204) and without (n=196). Statistical analysis comparing between the different groups were
conducted using R statistic package "SNPassoc".
Results: Two genetic models were used: the additive and co-dominant models. The I allele was found to be associated
with T2DM (OR=1.84, p=0.00009) after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. However, there was no association
with CVD susceptibility (p>0.05).
Conclusion: The ACE I allele is found to be associated with T2DM; however, no association was observed with CVD.
The inconsistency between studies is suggested to be attributed to genetic diversity due to the existence of sub-
populations found in Asian populations.

prevalence of obesity, another well-known risk factor for
CVD, is 48% in the Kuwaiti population.4
ACE is involved in converting angiotensin I into angioten-
sin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.5,6 The insertion/deletion (I/D)
polymorphism (rs4646994) of the angiotensin-converting
enzyme gene (ACE) is a 287-bp ALU repeat DNA sequence
found on intron 16.7 The DD and ID genotypes have been
associated with 60% and 30% higher ACE plasma levels
compared with the II genotype.7,8 The I/D polymorphism has
been found to be associated with increased risk of CVD9 and
T2DM;10 however, results are still inconsistent, with studies
finding no association11 or an inverse association.12,13 This
observed inconsistency seems to be attributed to gene­envi-
ronment interactions and population differences. Therefore
we aimed to investigate the association between the ACE I/D
(rs4646994) gene polymorphism and the risk of both CVD
and T2DM in patients from Kuwait.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
A total of 583 Kuwaiti nationals including both patients
(n=400) and controls (n=183) were recruited for this study;
they were asked to sign an informed consent for the pur-
pose of the study. The samples were collected from various
hospitals in Kuwait during the period February to April
2010. Relevant phenotypic data was recorded and docu-
mented for each sample (Table 1). This study has been
approved by the Local Ethical Committee at Kuwait
University as well as the Ministry of Health Ethical Board
Kuwait following the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
Clinical diagnosis and blood biochemical
analysis
The CVD patient samples (n=400) were recruited mainly
from the Chest Hospital, Al-Amiri Hospital and Mubarak
Hospitals. The mean age of patients was 55 years old,
including 263 males and 137 females. Clinical diagnosis
was provided from the medical profile according to the
presence of typical chest pain, echocardiogram and previ-
ous history of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty
or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
coronary artery bypass graft. The CVD patient samples
were further divided into two groups: with confirmed
T2DM (n=204), based on the criteria suggested by
American Diabetes Association,14 and those without
T2DM (n=196). The control group included a randomized
sample of Kuwaiti nationals who are confirmed to be free
of CVD based on angiography indicating a normal coro-
nary artery with no evidence of plaque, smooth and no evi-
dence of peripheral vascular disease, and medical records.
A peripheral venous whole-blood sample (10 ml) was
collected from all the subjects under complete aseptic condi-
tions by a certified hospital laboratory staff following a mini-
mum of 12 hours of fasting. Quantitative measurements of
blood plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined in 3 ml of
blood by enzymatic methods with commercially available
kits (Synchron System Reagents, Beckman Coulter, USA)
analyzed on a UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical Systems
(Beckman Coulter, USA) in the clinical chemistry laborato-
ries at the relevant hospital, Ministry of Health. The normal
values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDLused as
reference were 3.0­5.2, 0.40­2.50, 0.91­1.81, 1.8­3.3
mmol/l, 0.0­40 mmol/l, respectively. The lipid profile for
patients who were under medication and treatment was not
provided, since their lipid profiles were post treatment and
hence were of normal values; however, the medical history
of dyslipidemic patients was recorded and, if available from
the medical records, old profiles were used.
Genotyping
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 7 ml of whole
blood by the salting-out method as previously described
Table 1. Demographic characteristics and distribution of risk factors in CVD patients and healthy controls.

by Miller et al.15 The final volume of the extracted DNA
was 1 ml, to yield a final concentration of 10 ng/1 µl.
All extracted DNA was analyzed prior to genotyping
using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ND 1000,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, Delaware,
USA).
Genotyping of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism
(rs4646994) was achieved by amplification of the target
sequence by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).16
Two specific primers flanking the polymorphic site in
intron 16 of the ACE gene were used (forward:
5'-GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT-3' and reverse:
5'-CTGGAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3').Theexpected
PCR products of 490 bp and 190 bp correspond to the I and
D alleles, respectively. The D allele has been reported to
have a higher chance for amplification than the I allele, render-
ing potential mistyping of ID heterozygous, and in some cases
its suppression yielding mistyping as DD.17 Although the
mechanism for this suppression is not fully understood, the
mistyping is considered a serious concern. Therefore, all hete-
rozygous ID and homozygous DD were re-genotyped by a sec-
ond round of amplification using an insertion-specific primer
pair (forward: 5'-TGGGACCACAGCGCCCGCCACTA C-3'
and reverse: 5'-TCGCCAGCCCTCCCATGC CCATAA-3')
that recognizes the inserted sequence.18 The amplified PCR
products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel (routine use-
Sigma; A9539, USA). A 50 bp DNA ladder was used to esti-
mate the size of the PCR products. Electrophoresis was
carried out at a constant voltage of 200 V with 250 mA for
about 2 h, or until the dye reached the edge of the gel.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software
(version 22; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Results were
expressed as mean ± SEM and percentages where appro-
priate. Logarithmic transformation was applied where
appropriate. Hardy­Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was
tested using the web-based calculator available at www.
tufts.edu/, which confirmed the population to be in equi-
librium. The genetic association was analyzed and con-
trolled for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) using the
SNPassoc package from R software.19 The results are
expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI). A power > 80% at alpha = 0.05 was achieved
in this study assuming an average OR of 2.5 and minor
allele frequency of 11% using the statistical software
package StatCalc (version 7.1.2.0; Epi InfoTM, Atlanta
GA, USA).
Results
The clinical and demographic characteristics of controls
and CVD patients are reported in Table 1. Among the 400
patients with CVD, 204 were classified as CVD with
T2DM and 196 CVD without T2DM. The mean age of
CVD patients was higher than that in controls and there-
fore was controlled for in all statistical analysis along with
BMI and sex. The frequency of genotypes were found in
HWE in the control samples (p=0.78) whereas it deviated
in the CVD samples (p=0.007). The minor allele (I) fre-
quency in controls was 31% compared with 42% in CVD.
A positive association of the ACE I allele with CVD
was observed (Table 2). Association of the I allele was
observed in all genetic models as well with p<0.01 after
adjusting for BMI, age and sex (Table 2). The frequency of
the II genotype was higher in CVD patients compared with
controls (20.2% compared with 10.9%, respectively) and
with an OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.16­1.94; p=0.001) in the addi-
tive model (Table 2). However, there was no association
observed after controlling for T2DM (p>0.05). The results
remained significant in all genetic models after controlling
for hypertension (p<0.05).
Association was diminished after controlling for
T2DM, and therefore we compared the association of the
ACE rs4646994 polymorphism between controls and
CVD patients with T2DM (Table 3). The I allele was
found to be associated with CVD in patients with T2DM

genotype was higher in the patients group compared
with controls (24% compared with 10.9%, respectively)
with an OR of 2.39 (95% CI 1.3­4.39; p=0.00009) in the
additive model (Table 3). The lack of association
between controls and CVD patients without T2DM is
summarized in Table 4 in which no association was
observed in all studied genetic models (p>0.05) (Table
4). Although the frequency of II genotype was higher in
CVD patients without T2DM compared with controls
(16.3% compared with 10.9%, respectively), results
failed to reach significance (p>0.05).
Furthermore we compared the distribution of the ACE
rs4646994 polymorphism among CVD patients with and
without T2DM (Table 5). The association between
the ACE I allele and CVD was found associated with
CVD patients with T2DM compared with CVD without
T2DM in both the dominant and additive genetic models
(p>0.05) (Table 5). The frequency of the ACE II geno-
type was higher in CVD patients with T2DM compared
with those without T2DM (24% compared with 16.3%,
respectively) and with an OR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.05­1.85;
p=0.02) in the additive model (Table 5).
Discussion
We observed a positive association between the ACE I
allele and T2DM. The observed association between the
ACE I allele and CVD was diminished once controlled for
T2DM. Our findings support that the initial association
observed with CVD is mediated through the presence of
T2DM. This was confirmed when a significant association
of the ACE I allele in CVD patients with T2DM compared
with those without T2DM was detected. Recent findings
have shown the association between the ACE D allele and
risk of developing CVD and T2DM.20­23 On the other

hand, a lack of association between the ACE I/D polymor-
phism with CVD and T2DM has also been reported.11,24
However, an association of the ACE I allele conferring an
increase in disease risk is rarely observed, as in the case of
this study. A recent meta-analysis on Asian populations
demonstrated the D allele and the II genotype was associ-
ated with the risk of T2DM patients developing T2DM
nephropathy (T2DN).13 Another study, by Vijayan et al.,
demonstrated an association of the ACE I allele with an
increased risk of ischemic stroke among males in south
India.12 However, a meta-analysis on Arab populations
demonstrated the D allele to be associated with T2DM.23
Inconsistency can be attributed to the heterogeneity among
these studies, and therefore differences in ethnicity and
study design are the most likely explanation according to
various authors.12,13 In the current study all samples were
of Kuwaiti nationality, suggesting homogeneity. However,
three genetic subgroups have been previously defined in
the Kuwaiti population, and therefore future studies may
need to be stratified accordingly.25,26
Our association of the ACE I allele with T2DM can be
explained by understanding the complexity of the rennin­
angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS) as reviewed by
Rahimi et al.27 Angiotensin II is converted by ACE, result-
ing in aldosterone secretion and elevated blood pressure.27
A study using intravenous infusion of angiotensin II
showed an enhanced blood flow resulting in insulin sensi-
tivity.28 This is consistent with previous findings showing
that homozygous carriers of the I allele of the ACE gene
have greater insulin resistance compared with carriers of
the DD genotype.29­31 A study by Katsuya et al. demon-
strated that subjects with the DD genotype were more
insulin sensitive.32 Another study demonstrated that DD
and ID genotypes were associated with lower insulin
resistance compared with II genotypes,31 and that doses of
angiotensin II increase insulin sensitivity in healthy sub-
jects.33 The DD and ID genotypes show 60% and 30%
higher ACE plasma levels compared with the II genotype,
supporting the association with insulin resistance.7,8 Such
findings suggest a potential risk to T2DM in subjects car-
rying the I allele of the ACE gene, which is consistent with
our findings. Due to the inconsistency in findings and
complexity of the RAAS it is possible that gene­gene
interactions play a major role within this system,34 and
therefore it would be useful to investigate the interactions
of other genetic markers in the RAAS in patients with
T2DM.
The inconsistency in association studies observed with
the ACE I/D polymorphism may also be attributed to epi-
genetic mechanisms, which are alterations in gene expres-
sion due several modifications that include DNA
methylation, histone modifications and RNA-based mech-
anisms that are not caused by changes in DNA
sequences.35,36 A recent study by Rangel et al. demon-
strated an interaction between DNA methylation and the
ACE I/D polymorphism.37 The DD genotype was found to
be associated with a decrease in DNA methylation, which
was associated with higher ACE activity.37 Environmental
factors such as nutrition and physical activity have been
associated with modifying a gene's epigenetic status.38,39
Differences in nutrition and levels of physical activity dif-
fer between populations. Therefore such interaction
between epigenetic modifications and polymorphisms
describes the complexity of the genetic architecture which
can underlie the inconsistency in association studies
observed with the ACE I/D polymorphism in different
populations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study is the first to find an asso-
ciation of the ACE I allele and T2DM in an Arab popula-
tion. More association studies with a stratified population
are required to confirm this finding. Our results suggest

studied and epigenetic mechanisms. The limitation of our
study is the absence of measurement of ACE plasma level
and its correlation with the ACE genotype.
