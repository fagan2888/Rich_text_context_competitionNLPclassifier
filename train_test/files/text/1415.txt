High Serum Retinyl Esters Are Not Associated with
Reduced Bone Mineral Density in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­1994

ABSTRACT
Hypervitaminosis A is sometimes associated with abnormalities of calcium metabolism and bone mineral
status. A recent study found a negative association between reported dietary vitamin A intake and bone
mineral density (BMD). Some segments of the U.S. population have high fasting serum retinyl ester concen-
trations, a physiological marker that may reflect high and possibly excessive vitamin A intake. We examined
the association between fasting serum retinyl esters and BMD in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, 1988­1994 (NHANES III), a large, nationally representative sample of the U.S. popu-
lation. BMD was measured for the femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip on all nonpregnant
participants aged >20 years; 5790 participants also had complete data on fasting serum retinyl esters and
covariates including age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary supplement use,
diabetes, physical activity, and, among women, parity, menopausal status, and the use of oral contraceptives
or estrogen-replacement therapy. The sample included non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American men and women. We examined the association between fasting serum retinyl esters and BMD at
each site, controlling for covariates with multiple linear regression. We examined the association with
osteopenia and osteoporosis with multiple logistic regression. Although the prevalences of high fasting serum
retinyl esters concentration and low BMD were both substantial in this sample, there were no significant
associations between fasting serum retinyl esters and any measure of bone mineral status. (J Bone Miner Res

INTRODUCTION
ABNORMALITIES OF calcium metabolism and of bone min-
eral status have been documented in case reports of
hypervitaminosis A.(1­18) Concern has been expressed about
the potential for excess vitamin A intake in developed
countries where the food supplies are rich in naturally
occurring and fortified vitamin A and where supplements
are readily available and may be overused.(19) One health
risk attributed to excess vitamin A intake, even for intake
below the level associated with hypervitaminosis A, is ac-
celerated bone mineral loss(20) but most previous studies
assessing the association between dietary vitamin A intake
and bone mineral density (BMD) have found either no
association(21­24) or a slight protective effect.(23­25) Much
attention has been focused on a recent study of Swedish
women by Melhus et al.(26) that found a negative association
between dietary vitamin A intake and BMD. The latter

study prompted commentators to suggest that adverse bone
effects of vitamin A could occur at intakes readily achieved
by dietary choices and supplement use and that the current
safe upper limit for retinol intake may not provide an
adequate margin of safety.(27,28)
Vitamin A status is difficult to assess with dietary meth-
ods.(29) Only one previous study of BMD included serum
retinol as a physiological measure of the vitamin A status of
the participants.(22) However, serum retinol is regulated by
liver storage and by the production of retinol-binding pro-
tein; a wide range of serum retinol concentrations are con-
sistent with normal status.(30) Fasting serum retinyl esters
have been used as a marker of potential excess vitamin A
because they appear in circulation if intake exceeds liver
storage capacity or retinol-binding protein production.(30­33)
Generally, it is accepted that the normal fasting serum
retinyl ester concentration is 244 nmol/liter (7 g/dl)
and that the ratio of fasting serum retinyl esters to total
serum vitamin A (retinol bound to retinol-binding protein
plus retinyl esters) is 8%; ratios 10% have been inter-
preted as markers of potential toxicity.(30­33)
We recently reported relatively high serum retinol con-
centrations and an unexpectedly high prevalence of fasting
serum retinyl esters 10% of total serum vitamin A among
adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, 1988­1994 (NHANES III).(34,35) The
NHANES III survey also collected data on BMD(36,37) and
thus provides the first opportunity to explore the association
between BMD and fasting serum retinyl esters as a physi-
ological marker of potential excess vitamin A intake in a
large sample of adults in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES III was a nationally representative, complex
probability sample survey of the noninstitutionalized popu-
lation of the United States. Details of the study design and
interview and examination procedures have been pub-
lished.(38) This analysis is based on the public release data
set.(39) BMD (g/cm2) was measured with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (model QDR-1000; Hologic, Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA); the same equipment was used throughout the
survey.(37) Measurements were made on male and nonpreg-
nant female participants aged 20 years.(37) The left hip
was scanned if it had not been broken previously or did not
have pins or a replacement; otherwise, the right hip was
scanned. The total region and four individual sites were
measured: the femoral neck, trochanter, intertrocanter, and
Ward's triangle. Methodology for the measurement of
Ward's triangle changed between phases 1 and 2 of the
survey so we did not include it in our analysis.(40) The
distributions of BMD and the prevalence of osteopenia and
osteoporosis in NHANES III have been published.(36,37)
Laboratory analyses were performed in the laboratory of
the National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Serum retinol and reti-
nyl esters were measured by high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC; Waters Chromatography Division,
Milford, MA, USA). Detailed descriptions of the laboratory
methods and of the quality assurance protocols of the survey
have been published.(38,41)
We confined our analysis to participants who were fasting
(12 h) at the time blood was drawn for serum retinyl esters
measurement (48% of the participants with hip scans) and
who had complete data on potential covariates and exclu-
sionary criteria. We excluded 648 participants with condi-
tions or characteristics that might affect vitamin A metab-
olism or BMD, including those taking antiseizure or
corticosteroid medications, undergoing cancer chemother-
apy or treatment for thyroid disease,(42) those with elevated
c-reactive protein indicating other acute infections or in-
flammatory conditions, those with acute hepatitis based on
antibody titers, those with chronic liver disease based on
clinical examination and medical history, and women who
were lactating. We also excluded 191 participants with
missing data on these characteristics. We excluded 278
participants of "other" race/ethnic identity because the cat-
egory is heterogeneous and the number of participants is
small.(38) The exclusions amounted to 17% of the partici-
pants with BMD and fasting serum retinyl ester measure-
ments. The final sample included 5790 participants and was
51% male, 84% non-Hispanic white, 11% non-Hispanic
black, and 5% Mexican American.
Participants were asked to report the details of their use of
dietary supplements in the 30 days before the interview. We
calculated the total vitamin A, vitamin D, and calcium
intake from supplements for each participant using the
NHANES nutrient content database for supplements.(43) We
did not include dietary intake from the 24-h diet recall
interview in our analysis because participants provided only
a single 24-h recall and multiple recalls are required to
estimate nutrient intakes accurately.(29) We did use the 24-h
diet recall records to ascertain that none of the participants
had consumed excessive amounts of preformed vitamin A
on the day before the test. The 99th percentile of preformed
vitamin A intake was 6200 g RE, the equivalent of 2 oz of
cooked liver. Preformed vitamin A intake on the day before
the examination accounted for less than four-tenths of 1% of
the variance in serum retinyl esters concentration (R2 
0.0036).
We stratified the analysis by sex and among women we
stratified by menopausal status. Menopause was defined
based on self-reported bilateral oophorectomy or 12 months
since last menstrual period. We included age in years and
body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms/height in
square meters) as continuous variables in all models after
determining that their associations with BMD were linear.
We controlled for other covariates known or suspected to
affect BMD including race/ethnicity; self-reported smoking
(never/former/current); self-reported heavy alcohol con-
sumption (five or more drinks per day more than once a
month); diabetes defined by medical history or discovered
by oral glucose tolerance test during the examination; self-
reported frequency of leisure-time physical activity in the
previous month (none/less than three times per week/greater
than or equal to three times per week); and vitamin A,
vitamin D, and calcium intakes from dietary supplements.
Among premenopausal women, we controlled for the use of
oral contraceptives. Among postmenopausal women, we
2307
ELEVATED RETINYL ESTERS AND BONE MINERAL DENSITY
controlled for the use of estrogen-replacements, the duration
of replacement use, and years since menopause. For all
women, we controlled for parity (0/1/2 births).
We defined osteopenia/osteoporosis according to the
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria(37,44): BMD  1
SD below the mean of the reference group (non-Hispanic
white participants 20­29 years old by sex from the
NHANES III survey). We combined osteopenia/
osteoporosis as a single endpoint because there were rela-
tively few participants with osteoporosis (2.5 SD below
mean of the reference group) except among participants
60 years.
We assessed the association between BMD at each site
(femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip re-
gion) and either fasting serum retinyl esters concentration or
fasting retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A
with multiple linear regression, controlling for statistically
significant covariates. We assessed the relative odds of
osteopenia/osteoporosis at each site associated with retinyl
esters with multiple logistic regression, controlling for sta-
tistically significant covariates. Age, BMI, and race/
ethnicity were included in all models. For other potential
covariates, only those statistically significant at the 0.05
level were included in the final models, which were ob-
tained by backward exclusion of nonsignificant independent
variables. We performed sensitivity and specificity tests
with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analy-
sis(45) in search of a sample-based cut point for fasting
serum retinyl ester concentration or percent fasting serum
retinyl esters associated with a significant increase in the
risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Analyses were performed
with SUDAAN software (version 7.5; Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, SC, USA), taking into
account the complex stratified and weighted nature of the
sample.(46)
RESULTS
Overall, 32.8% of participants had fasting serum retinyl
esters 10% of total serum vitamin A and one-quarter or
more had osteopenia/osteoporosis at one or more sites (Ta-
ble 1). The patterns of association between BMD or
osteopenia/osteoporosis and the covariates included in the
analysis were similar for all four sites considered (data not
shown). Fasting serum retinyl ester concentration and fast-
ing serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A
were highly correlated and exhibited similar associations
with BMD and osteopenia/osteoporosis (data not shown).
Therefore, we present only the models predicting BMD or
osteopenia/osteoporosis at the femoral neck from percent
fasting serum retinyl esters. These results are representative
of all the models analyzed. We chose to present the models
for femoral neck because it is a common site of osteoporotic
fracture.
The expected negative association of BMD with age, the
positive association with BMI, and the racial/ethnic differ-
ences were noted in this analysis, as was the protective
effect of current estrogen-replacement therapy among post-
menopausal women (Table 2). Current and former smokers
had significantly lower BMD than nonsmokers among men
but not among premenopausal or postmenopausal women.
Physical activity and diabetes mellitus were significantly
positively associated with BMD only among men. None of

the other covariates tested were associated with BMD at the
0.05 level of statistical significance in any model. Fasting
serum retinyl ester concentration or fasting serum retinyl
esters as percent of total serum vitamin A were not signif-
icantly associated with BMD at any site after controlling for
significant covariates.
The relative odds of having osteopenia/osteoporosis in-
creased with age, decreased with increasing BMI, and was
greatest among non-Hispanic white participants in all sub-
groups, although the differences between non-Hispanic
white and Mexican American women did not achieve the
0.05 level of statistical significance for either premeno-
pausal or postmenopausal women (Table 3). Current
estrogen-replacement therapy was protective among post-
menopausal women. Fasting serum retinyl ester concentra-
tion or fasting serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum
vitamin A was not associated with an increased risk of
osteopenia/osteoporosis at any site in any stratum after
controlling for significant covariates.
Sensitivity/specificity (ROC) analysis did not identify any
value of fasting serum retinyl ester concentration or any
value of fasting serum retinyl esters as percent of total
serum vitamin A that was significantly associated with the
presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We found no associations between physiological indica-
tors of potential excess vitamin A intake and either BMD or
osteopenia/osteoporosis in a large sample of U.S. adults
although nearly one-third of the sample had fasting serum
retinyl esters 10% of total serum vitamin A, the level
widely believed to indicate excess vitamin A.(30­33) The
sample size for this analysis provides adequate power to
show a significant association between BMD and fasting
serum retinyl esters in a regression model with a regression
coefficient of 0.01 or an increase in the prevalence of
osteopenia/osteoporosis of 15% associated with elevated
fasting serum retinyl esters, both at the p  0.01 level of
statistical significance and type II error  0.10. In addition,
the use of osteopenia or osteoporosis as an endpoint, instead
of the more conservative osteoporosis only, would be ex-
pected to detect an association between vitamin A status and
early trends in bone mineral loss.
Our results are consistent with those of previous studies
that found no associations between vitamin A intake and
BMD.(21­24) Our results are not consistent with those of
Melhus et al.,(26) who found a modest negative association
between reported dietary vitamin A intake and BMD, which
was attributable to the influence of women in the highest
quartile of intake relative to those in the lower three quar-
tiles. The women aged 28­74 years examined by Melhus et
al. had lower intakes of vitamin A (mean, 780  420 SD g
RE/day; range, 200­253,000 g RE/day) than the partici-
pants from the NHANES III sample included in this anal-
ysis. We can compute group mean intakes with confidence
although we were not able to assess individual usual intakes
from a single day of recall.(29) The median dietary plus

supplemental vitamin A intake for all participants included
in our analysis was 2193 g RE/day (range, 134­35,885
g) for men, 1837 g RE/day (range, 254­30,677 g) for
premenopausal women, and 2096 g RE/day (range, 281­
31,140 g) for postmenopausal women. The recommended
dietary allowance (RDA) for adult males is 900 g RE/day,
for adult females is 700 g RE/day, and the upper limit for
adults is 3,000 g RE/day.(47)
The primary difference between our study and that of
Melhus et al.(26) is that we used a physiological marker of
potential excess vitamin A consumption whereas they used
dietary intake data. Melhus et al.(26) used four 1-week diet
records for their BMD study, many more days than most
epidemiological studies collect, but it has been estimated
that 365 days are required to estimate "usual" or long-
term intakes of vitamin A because of the distribution of
vitamin A in the food supply.(29) For vitamin A status, a
physiological measure may be more appropriate to assess
potential risk.
Elevated fasting serum retinyl esters are indicators of
vitamin A intake in excess of liver capacity to store retinol
and to produce retinol-binding protein.(30) Serum retinyl
esters deliver retinol to the tissues unregulated by retinol-
binding protein, which is responsible for the toxic effects of
excess retinol on cell membranes including those of
bone.(48) There are many case reports that clinical hypervi-
taminosis A is associated with a variety of alterations of
calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, especially in
young children given very large doses of supplemental
vitamin A.(1­9) There also are reports of hypervitaminosis A
accompanied by abnormal calcium status among adoles-
cents and adults, although not all patients exhibited
demineralization.(2,10­18) In the case reports, patients with
altered calcium metabolism and bone lesions reported reti-
nol intakes ranging from 10 times to 90 times the recom-
mended levels for age, in some cases for extended periods
of time, and they had clinical signs of hypervitaminosis A.
Overall, 25.6% of our sample reported taking supple-
ments containing vitamin A. The median intake of vitamin
A obtained from supplements was 1495 g RE/day and the
range was 5­35,885 g RE/day. Only 54 participants re-
ported taking 3000 g RE/day, the current recommended
upper limit of intake,(47) and only 7 reported taking
10,000 g RE/day. All of the participants who reported
taking supplements had serum retinyl ester concentrations
and serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A
within normal limits. None of the participants in this sam-
ple, whether they took supplements or not, had signs of
clinical hypervitaminosis A noted in the clinical examina-
tion, nor did any have liver disease as assessed by five
biochemical measures of liver dysfunction.(35)
This analysis has several advantages over previous stud-
ies in addition to the availability of a physiological marker
for potential excess vitamin A intake. The sample is very
large, includes both men and women, and includes partici-
pants from 20 to 90 years of age. Most previous studies
included only postmenopausal women(21­23) or elderly par-
ticipants.(25) However, there are limitations to the general-
izability of our analysis. We excluded 48% of the partici-
pants with BMD measurements who were not fasting at the
time blood was drawn for the analysis of serum retinyl
esters. Fasting status was determined by the examination
schedule: participants examined in the morning were fasting
12 h but those examined in the afternoon were not. There
is no reason to expect that scheduling of the examination
would be related systematically to vitamin A status, BMD,
or any of the covariates included in the analysis. We also
excluded 17% of the participants with BMD and fasting
serum retinyl ester data because they were taking medica-
tions that might be expected to alter vitamin A metabolism
or BMD; because they had acute infections, inflammatory
conditions, or chronic liver disease; or because they were
missing data on these characteristics or missing data for the
covariates included in the analysis. Most were, because of
the exclusionary criteria, acutely or chronically ill. Al-
though these exclusions taken together may reduce the
representativeness of our sample and thus may limit our
ability to generalize the results of our analysis, this does not

negate the results we observed in this large sample of U.S.
adults.
We conclude that although the prevalence of relatively
high fasting serum retinyl esters is substantial in the U.S.
population,(35) this marker of vitamin A status was not
associated with evidence of reduced BMD in this sample of
apparently healthy adults. We wish to emphasize that none
of the participants included in this analysis showed clinical
signs of hypervitaminosis A and very few reported taking
large amounts of supplemental vitamin A. The potential for
vitamin A toxicity as a result of extreme dietary practices or
overenthusiastic use of supplements and the potential for
associated systemic effects including accelerated bone min-
eral loss should not be minimized based on our results.
However, within the range represented by this sample,
vitamin A status does not appear to be associated with
BMD.
