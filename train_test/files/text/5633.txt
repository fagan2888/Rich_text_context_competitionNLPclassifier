Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of hypothermia on the pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics of nimodipine in rabbits using in vivo and in vitro methods.
Methods: Five healthy New Zealand rabbits received a single dose of nimodipine (0.5 mg/kg)
intravenously under normothermic and hypothermic conditions. Doppler ultrasound was used to
monitor cerebral blood flow, vascular resistance, and heart rate. In vitro evaluations of protein
binding, hepatocyte uptake and intrinsic clearance of liver microsomes at different temperatures
were also conducted.
Results: Plasma concentrations of nimodipine were significantly higher in hypothermia than in
normothermia. Nimodipine improved cerebral blood flow under both conditions, but had a longer
effective duration during the hypothermic period. Low temperature decreased the intrinsic
clearance of liver microsomes, with no change in protein binding or hepatocyte uptake of
nimodipine.
Conclusion: Nimodipine is eliminated at a slower rate during hypothermia than during
normothermia, mainly due to the decreased activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. This results
in elevated system exposure with little enhancement in pharmacological effect.

Introduction
Hypothermia is defined as a central tem-
perature 36C, and is classified into three
types: mild (34­36C), moderate (30­34C)
and severe (<30C). Whether accidental or
intentional, hypothermia can be induced by
a variety of chemical or physical interven-
tions, such as sustained low temperature,
severe trauma, shock, anesthesia, and infu-
sion of a large amount of fluid.1,2 Reduction
of body temperature suppresses a broad
range of pathological and physiological
processes, especially those involving energy
consumption. Negative effects include low-
ering oxygen and glucose demands, inter-
ruption of apoptotic pathways, inhibition of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, and blocking
of neuroexcitatory cascades.3 As a result,
hypothermia is neuroprotective and can be
used to treat focal and global ischemic brain
injury.4 Indeed, intentional hypothermia,
often referred to as ``therapeutic hypother-
mia'', has been translated into clinical prac-
tice to improve neurological outcomes in
many hypoxic­ischemic diseases including
cardiac arrest, neonatal encephalopathy,
traumatic brain injury, convulsive status
epilepticus, myocardial ischemia, spinal
cord injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage.5,6
Certain physiological processes that
mediate drug metabolism, disposition and
response also need energy, and are vul-
nerable to theoretically unavoidable
temperature-induced changes in drug
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
which may increase the occurrence of
unanticipated adverse drug effects.7 In prac-
tice, there is a large body of preclinical and
clinical evidence for altered drug disposition
during hypothermia. For example, the
expression and activity of a variety of meta-
bolic enzymes and transporters such as
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, CYP2E1,
CYP3A2, CYP3A4 and permeability
glycoprotein (P-gp) may change at a low
temperature.8 Hypothermia can reduce the
elimination of a number of xenobiotics and
endogenous substances, such as ethanol,
general anesthetics (rocuronium and
atracurium), macrolide antibiotics (genta-
mycin), antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin),
antidepressant drugs (phenobarbitone),
glycine and glutamate.9 Hypothermia also
leads to changes in the pharmacodynamic
336 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
profile of drugs such as phenobarbitone,
pancuronium bromide and furosemide.10
Coupled with therapeutic hypothermia,
critically ill patients are often subjected to a
wide variety of medications. Many of these
drugs have narrow therapeutic windows and
have not been thoroughly studied under
hypothermic conditions.11 As a result, the
success or failure of this promising interven-
tion depends largely on rational drug dose
adjustments by clinicians based on evidence
and on an intimate knowledge of drug
interactions.
Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine-like cal-
cium channel antagonist that selectively
dilates cerebral arteries and increases cere-
bral blood flow in animals and humans.12 Its
major therapeutic indication is the preven-
tion and treatment of delayed ischemic
neurological disorders that often occur in
patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages.13
Matsumoto et al.14 have demonstrated that
nimodipine combined with therapeutic
hypothermia increases the beneficial effects
in neurological outcomes. However, no
information is currently available regarding
either the possible changes of in vivo expos-
ure and response to nimodipine under
conditions of therapeutic hypothermia, or
the specific mechanisms underlying these
changes. The objectives of the present
study, therefore, were a) to investigate the
effects of hypothermia on the pharmacokin-
etics and pharmacodynamics of nimodipine
in rabbits; and b) to identify the mechanisms
underlying alterations in systemic clearance
by in vitro evaluation of the effects of
hypothermia on nimodipine protein bind-
ing, hepatocyte uptake and intrinsic clear-
ance (CLint) of rabbit liver microsomes.
Materials and methods
Drugs and reagents
The following drugs/reagents were used
in the study: nimodipine for injection
(batch no. EXG2G31; Bayer HealthCare
Corporation, Beijing, China), nimodipine
standard (batch no. 100270-200002;
National Institute for the Control of
Pharmaceutical and Biological Products,
Beijing, China), aconitine (Sigma­Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA), 1-aminobenzotriazole
(Sigma­Aldrich), methanol, acetonitrile
(chromatography grade; SK chemicals,
Seoul, Korea); all other reagents and
solvents were analytical grade.
Animal experiments
Five male New Zealand rabbits weighing
2.2­2.6 kg (age: 120 days) were purchased
from Vital River Ltd. (Beijing, China). As
estrogens are potent and efficacious neuro-
protectants,15 only male animals were used
in this study. All rabbits were raised in an
atmosphere where the temperature was
22 Æ 1C and humidity was 60 Æ 10%. The
study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Navy General Hospital
and conducted in accordance with Chinese
GLP standards. Rabbits were fasted for 12 h
before surgery with free access to water.
In the first period of studies at normal
body temperature, rabbits were placed on
the operating table in the prone position.
Skin preparation and sterilization were con-
ducted in the parietal region of the skull.
After anesthesia, a vertical incision of about
5 cm was made. The skin was retracted, and
a rounded bone window about 0.8 cm in
diameter was made in the parietal region of
the skull using a hand drill. The periosteum
was then carefully removed with tweezers,
and the wound was waxed to stop bleeding.
The cerebral dura was kept intact, while a
Doppler ultrasound probe (Acuson Sequoia
512, Siemens America, Malvern, PA, USA)
was placed in the rounded bone window to
record the cerebral blood flow image and the
quantitative pharmacodynamic data includ-
ing the velocity of the cerebral arterial blood
flow, vascular resistance, and heart rate. The
rectal temperature of each rabbit was
Fei et al. 337
monitored throughout the experiment with
a mercury thermometer.
After a 2-week ``washout'' period, rabbits
underwent the second study period, with
lowered body temperature. Rabbits were
cooled physically with ice packs placed on
the head, neck, abdomen, and limbs to
induce hypothermia. The same operations
were conducted in this period as in the first
period. Rectal temperature data for both
periods are listed in Table 1.
Drug administration
During each hypothermic period, a single
dose (0.5 mg/kg) of nimodipine was injected
intravenously into the inner ear vein 20 min
after rectal temperature stabilization.
A blood sample (1 mL) was collected from
the contralateral ear vein before and 0.167,
0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after drug admin-
istration. The sample was placed in a hep-
arin tube, and centrifuged at 3500 Â g for
10 min. The plasma was carefully drawn and
kept at À80C.
Nimodipine analysis
An LC­MS/MS spectrometer (Xevo TQ MS
system, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was
used to measure the plasma concentration of
nimodipine. Aconitine was added as an
internal standard and an aliquot of 0.2 mL
plasma was subjected to extraction with 1 mL
extraction liquid (n-hexane: ether¼ 1:1) for
2 min, then centrifugation at 3500Â g for
3 min. The supernatant was collected and
placed into another centrifuge tube, while the
residue was extracted again using the method
described above. The mixed extraction liquid
was then evaporated with nitrogen at 40C.
The residue was dissolved with 200 mL mobile
phase, then centrifuged at 3500Â g for
15min. A 10-mL volume of supernatant
was injected into the LC­MS/MS system
for quantitative analysis.
Chromatographic conditions were as
follows: ACQUITY BEHC18 column
(2.1 Â 100 mm, 1.7 mm); column tempera-
ture, 35C; sample room temperature,
10C; mobile phase, methanol:water (65:
35,v/v); flow rate, 0.3 mL/min. The main
working parameters for the mass spectrum
were set as follows: ion source, electrospray
ionization; capillary voltage, 3.0 kV; cone
hole voltage, 18 V; atomization flow rate,
800 L/h; cone hole flow rate, 30 L/h; source
temperature, 400C. Quantification was per-
formed using the MRM method in a positive
ion mode with transitions of m/z

Protein binding analysis
Protein binding of nimodipine in rabbit
plasma was determined using the equilib-
rium dialysis method. Plasma was collected
from normal rabbits and stored at À80C
until experimentation. Nimodipine was
mixed with rabbit plasma to reach a final
concentration of 10 mg/mL and 500 -mL ali-
quots were placed into the sample chambers
of the rapid equilibrium dialysis system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford,
IL, USA) equipped with a dialysis mem-
brane (molecular weight cut-off, $8000) to
separate the sample chamber and the buffer
chamber. The buffer chamber was filled with
750 mL phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M pH
7.4). The samples (n ¼ 4 per temperature
group) were incubated for 18 h at 37C, 32C
or 28C using a shaking water bath. The
nimodipine concentrations in both chambers
were determined using the method described
above. The unbound fraction ratio (fu) of
nimodipine in rabbit plasma was calculated
using the following equation:
fu ¼
Cbuffer
Ctotal
ð1Þ
where Cbuffer
and Ctotal
are the nimodipine
concentrations in the buffer chamber and
the sample chamber, respectively.
Enzyme kinetics analysis
Rabbit liver microsomes were purchased
from BD Biosciences (Woburn, MA, USA).
All reaction mixtures (0.1mL) contained
400 mg/mL of microsomal protein, phos-
phate-buffered saline (0.1 M pH 7.4), MgCl2
(2mM) and 1 mM reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).
Nimodipine was added at increasing final
concentrations of 0.023, 0.068, 0.21, 0.62, 1.9,
5.6, 16.7, and 50mM. These samples were
incubated for 5 min at 37C, 32C or 28C in
a circulating water bath. Preliminary experi-
ments showed that the nimodipine concen-
tration decreased linearly for 5 min at each
temperature (data not shown). The reaction
was quenched by adding 200 mL acetonitrile
containing internal standard. After centrifu-
gation at 20,000Â g for 10min at 4C, the
nimodipine concentration in the super-
natants was determined by LC­MS/MS as
described above. The rate of metabolism (v)
of nimodipine in the incubation sample was
calculated using the following equation:
v ¼
C0 À Ct
ð Þ Â V
t
ð2Þ
where C0
and Ct
are the concentrations
of nimodipine at 0 min or t min, respectively.
V is the volume of the incubation sample.
The Michaelis­Menten constant (Km
)
and maximum velocity (Vmax
) were calcu-
lated using OriginPro 9.0 (OriginLab Corp,
Northampton, MA, USA) via nonlinear
regression by fitting the raw data to the
Michaelis­Menten equation:

Hepatocyte uptake analysis
To investigate the effects of temperature on
hepatic uptake, cryopreserved New Zealand
white rabbit hepatocytes (male donor,
XenoTech, Kansas City, KS, USA) were
diluted with Krebs­Henseleit buffer containing
5mM 1-aminobenzotriazole to inhibit metab-
olism by CYP as a ``suicide substrate.''16 After
preincubation at 37, 32 or 28C for 30min,
nimodipine was added to the incubation sys-
tems (1Â 106 cells/ml) at increasing final con-
centrations of 0.08, 0.24, 0.73, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25,
12.5, 25 and 50mM. After 1min incubation,
the samples were centrifuged immediately at
15,000Â g for 1min at 4C. The nimodipine
concentration in the supernatant was deter-
mined, and the rate of uptake (v) of nimodi-
pine was calculated using equation 2.
Statistical analysis
Noncompartmental analysis in WinNonlin
v. 33 (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA,
USA) was used to calculate the pharmaco-
kinetic parameters of nimodipine. All data
are expressed as mean Æ standard deviation
(
x Æ s). Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Paired t-tests were used to compare
plasma concentration, pharmacokinetic par-
ameters, and pharmacodynamic indicators
(cerebral blood flow rate, vascular resistance
over time). One-way ANOVA was used for
in vitro data. P < 0.05 was considered stat-
istically significant.
Results
Effect of hypothermia on the
pharmacokinetics of nimodipine
The standard curves for nimodipine in rabbit
plasma were linear from 1 to 1000ng/mL.
Precision and accuracy were consistent with
the requirements for quantitative analysis.
The mean plasma concentration­time profiles
in rabbits under normothermia and
hypothermia after single intravenous adminis-
tration of 0.5mg/kg nimodipine are shown in
Figure 1 and the corresponding pharmacoki-
netic parameters are presented in Table 2.
Compared with the normothermic period,
pharmacokinetics of nimodipine in the hypo-
thermic period showed significantly greater
plasma concentration, area under the curve
(2239.54 vs 512.67ng/mL h), half life (3.95 vs
2.29h), mean residence time (4.44 vs 2.10h),
peak plasma concentration (902.34 vs
343.07ng/mL), and a significant decrease
in apparent distribution volume (0.835 vs
1.65L) and systemic clearance (0.58 vs
2.34L/h).
Effect of hypothermia on the
pharmacodynamics of nimodipine
Doppler results showed that the cerebral
blood flow in the normothermic period
(Figure 2(a)) was better than that in the hypo-
thermic period (Figure 2(c)). However, after
administration of a single intravenous dose of
nimodipine, the cerebral blood flow in both
periods (Figure 2(b, d)) was significantly
better than before administration.
The time-averaged maximum velocity
(TAMX) and resistive index (RI) in
both periods increased soon after nimodipine
administration. TAMX and RI during hypo-
thermia were slightly, but not significantly,
higher than during normothermia, except RI
at 0.16 and 4 h (Figure 3). However, the time
these values took to fall to baseline was
different between the two periods (TAMX:
1 h and RI: 2 h for normothermia; TAMX:
4 h and RI: 6 h for hypothermia). No change
in heart rate was observed in either period
(Table 1).
Alteration in the unbound fraction ratio

temperatures
The fu
of nimodipine in rabbit plasma at 37,
32 or 28C was determined using equilibrium

dialysis. No significant difference was found
in the fu
of nimodipine (37C: 1.42% Æ
0.11%, 32C: 1.51% Æ 0.25%, and 28C:
1.44% Æ 0.41%).
Effect of temperature on nimodipine
metabolism in rabbit liver microsomes
Figure 4 shows the Michaelis­Menten
plot for nimodipine elimination from
rabbit liver microsomes. The Km and
Vmax at 37, 32 or 28C were obtained
from the Michaelis­Menten equation. No
significant changes were observed in Km at
37, 32 or 28C (Table 3). However, the
Vmax of nimodipine was $34% lower at
32C and $62% lower at 28C than that at
37C. Correspondingly, the same differences
were observed when CLint invitro was
calculated using equation 4, and in vitro to

in vivo extrapolation of CLint was per-
formed using equation 5, where microsomal
protein content had been estimated as 45 mg
of protein/g of liver and the average weight
of the liver in our rabbits was estimated as
77 g/2.5 kg of body weight.17
Effect of temperature on nimodipine
uptake in rabbit hepatocytes
To determine the effects of temperature on
nimodipine uptake in rabbit hepatocytes, the
nimodipine concentration in supernatants
was determined at different temperatures in
the presence of a CYP inhibitor. The rate of
nimodipine uptake in rabbit hepatocytes
increased linearly at concentrations below
50mM (Figure 5) and neither the uptake rate
at different concentrations nor the slope of
the curve (k) (Table 3) differed significantly
between the two temperature groups.
Discussion
Nimodipine is mainly eliminated by the
liver. After administration, it is widely
distributed throughout the body and under-
goes extensive hepatic metabolism. Most of
the metabolic steps involve phase 1 reactions
catalyzed by CYP enzymes, mainly
CYP3A4.18 Orally administered nimodipine
is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism
from the portal circulation, resulting in low
systemic bioavailability.13 Therefore, in the
present study, the intravenous route was
selected to exclude the bioavailability factor.

Clearance is the most useful parameter
for evaluating the efficiency and mechanism
of drug elimination, defined as the hypo-
thetical volume of biological fluids irrevers-
ibly cleared of the drug per unit time. The
systemic clearance of a drug is the sum of the
clearance values from all the organs, mainly
the kidney and liver. For nimodipine, only the
parent compound is active and the hepatic
clearance approximates the systemic clear-
ance,19 therefore hepatic clearance, which is
the focus of the present study, may play the
most important role in plasma exposure and
response. According to the equation

and 1.09 Æ 0.19 L/h at 37C, 32C and 28C
respectively. Compared with in vivo observed
systemic clearance values (2.34 Æ 0.24L/h at
38C; 0.58 Æ 0.11L/h at 31C), the calculated
hepatic clearance values were comparable
during normothermia, but overestimated
during hypothermia. The reason for this
overestimation might have been due to reduc-
tions in hepatic blood flow during hypother-
mia being ignored in the course of calculating.
The results from the animal studies
showed that systemic clearance of nimodi-
pine during hypothermia was reduced by
75.2% compared with normothermia.
According to the function CLs ¼ Ke Â Vd,
changes in systemic clearance (CLs) are
contributed to equally by the reduction in
the volume of distribution (Vd) and the
elimination rate constant (Ke), resulting in
higher plasma concentration and t1/2
. The
lower Vd during hypothermia might have
resulted from reduced systemic blood flow,
including in the brain. However, nimodipine
significantly improved cerebral blood flow
at low temperatures, consistent with previ-
ous reports.22 We also found that the mag-
nitude of the improvement of cerebral blood
flow was not significant in either period with
administration of the same dose of nimodi-
pine, although the system exposure was
significantly higher in hypothermia than
that in normothermia. This phenomenon
might have arisen from the saturation of the
drug effect with higher exposure or the
reduced activity of the nimodipine receptor
during hypothermia.
The time it took TAMX and RI to return
to baseline levels in rabbits with hypother-
mia was significantly longer than that under

normothermia (TAMX: 4 h vs. 1 h; RI: 6 h
vs. 2 h respectively). As the parent com-
pound alone was active, the prolonged
effective duration of nimodipine could be
attributed to the lower rate of elimination in
hypothermia.
In summary, it is possible that hypother-
mia can decrease hepatic CLint for nimodi-
pine, contributing to a reduction in systemic
clearance. As a result, a routine dose of
nimodipine results in an elevated system
exposure with little enhancement in pharma-
cological effect. The higher risk of adverse
reactions with greater exposure makes it
necessary to optimize pharmacotherapeutic
regimens when nimodipine is clinically used
during therapeutic hypothermia; this can be
achieved by decreasing the routine dose by
25%. Follow-up studies that focus on hep-
atic blood flow and the exposure­response
relationship of nimodipine at different body
temperatures are needed to fully elucidate
the mechanism underlying the changes in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
