Objective: To identify associations between cocaine ex-
posure during pregnancy and medical conditions in new-
born infants from birth through hospital discharge.
Design: Multisite, prospective, randomized study.
Setting: Brown University, University of Miami, Uni-
versity of Tennessee (Memphis), and Wayne State Uni-
versity.
Subjects: A total of 717 cocaine-exposed infants and 7442
nonexposed infants.
Main Outcome Measures: Results of physical exami-
nation and conditions observed during hospitalization.
Results: Cocaine-exposed infants were about 1.2 weeks
younger, weighed 536 g less, measured 2.6 cm shorter,
and had head circumference 1.5 cm smaller than non-
exposed infants (all P.001). Results did not confirm pre-
viously reported abnormalities. Central and autonomic
nervous system symptoms were more frequent in the ex-
posed group: jittery/tremors (adjusted odds ratio, 2.17;
99% confidence interval, 1.44-3.29), high-pitched cry
(2.44; 1.06-5.66), irritability (1.81; 1.18-2.80), exces-
sive suck (3.58; 1.63-7.88), hyperalertness (7.78; 1.72-
35.06), and autonomic instability (2.64; 1.17-5.95). No
differences were detected in organ systems by ultra-
sound examination. Exposed infants had more infec-
tions (3.09; 1.76-5.45), including hepatitis (13.46; 7.46-
24.29), syphilis (8.84; 3.74-20.88), and human
immunodeficiency virus exposure (12.37; 2.20-69.51);
were less often breastfed (0.26; 0.15-0.44); had more child
protective services referrals (48.92; 28.77-83.20); and were
more often not living with their biological mother (18.70;
10.53-33.20).
Conclusions: Central and autonomic nervous system
symptoms were more frequent in the exposed cohort and
persisted in an adjusted analysis. They were usually tran-
sient and may be a true cocaine effect. Abnormal ana-
tomic outcomes previously reported were not con-
firmed. Increased infections, particularly sexually
transmitted diseases, pose a serious public health chal-
lenge. Exposure increased involvement of child protec-
tive services and out-of-home placement.

DRUG USE BY PREGNANT
women remains a perva-
sive problem in American
society. In 2002, 3% of all
pregnant women aged 15
to 44 years exposed their fetus to 1 or more
illicit drugs.1 Attempts to isolate effects
attributabletoaspecificdrugexposure,such
as cocaine, have often been confounded by
the use of multiple drugs and limited ac-
cesstolargevariedpopulations.Drugabus-
ers are mobile, difficult to track over time,
and often noncompliant.2,3 From the mid-
1980s into the early 1990s, a number of re-
ports raised concerns about the potential
teratogenic impact of fetal cocaine expo-
sure during pregnancy. These observa-
tions included congenital anomalies,4,5
growthretardation,6-8 microcephaly,9,10 cen-
tral nervous system infarction,11 seizures,12
cortical atrophy and cysts,13 intraventricu-
lar hemorrhage,14,15 various neurologic im-
pairments,16,17 genitourinary tract and re-
nal anomalies,18-20 gastrointestinal tract
defects,21,22 limb deformities,23 and respira-
tory insufficiency including sudden infant
death syndrome.24-27 A differential effect of
drug exposure on preterm vs term infants
has been suggested.28 More recent studies

and cocaine epidemic.
The Maternal Lifestyle Study (see page 833 for a list of
institutions and investigators) was conceived and de-
signed as a large multisite, prospective, randomized study,
whose objective was to confirm or negate the null hypoth-
esis that fetal cocaine exposure during pregnancy has no
impact on acute maternal and infant medical outcomes,
or on long-term neurodevelopmental infant outcomes.
Access to a large, multisite population was possible
through the National Institute of Child Health and Hu-
man Development Neonatal Research Network, which, at
the time the study was initiated, consisted of 12 major uni-
versityresearchcenters.Thefeasibilityofsuccessfullystudy-
ing multicultural, multiethnic, sociodemographically var-
ied populations with widespread use of drugs had been
previously documented at several of the network partici-
pating centers.39-41 Four of the 12 network sites were se-
lected by competitive peer review to participate in the Ma-
ternal Lifestyle Study. A wide range of acute medical
outcomes in cocaine-exposed and nonexposed infants, in-
cludingsociodemographiccircumstancesandpolydruguse,
were assessed in infants recruited at these sites. Acute ma-
ternal pregnancy outcomes in these cohorts have already
been reported.42 This report presents identified associa-
tions between cocaine exposure during pregnancy and
medical conditions in the newborn infant from birth
through hospital discharge or death.
METHODS
Recruitment and screening occurred during a 2-year period at
4 centers: Brown University, Providence, RI; the University of
Miami, Miami, Fla; the University of Tennessee, Memphis; and
Wayne State University, Detroit, Mich. Informed maternal con-
sent and institutional review board approval were required for
participation. Reasons for noneligibility and nonenrollment are
listed in Figure 1. Mothers who consented were more likely
to be black (50.5% vs 46.5%), to be unmarried (62.3% vs 56.5%),
and to have a history of drug use (13.0% vs 9.3%). Mothers who
identified themselves as white consented equally often (44.4%
vs 44.9%) while those who responded that they were of "other"
race consented at lower rates (5.1% vs 8.6%). Differences in
preterm delivery rate, abruptio placentae, prenatal care, and use
of Medicaid between those who consented and those who did
not were small. All low-birth-weight infants (1500 g) were
screened. Maternal and infant charts were reviewed to iden-
tify obvious protocol exclusions. Informed consent was usu-
ally obtained before or within 24 hours of delivery.
Initial screening included the mother's labor and delivery
record, the newborn admission record, and a meconium sample.
A detailed drug use questionnaire that addressed the mother's
use of nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and other
illicit drugs was given by research staff trained and certified in
the reliable administration of all the study interviews. A De-
partment of Health and Human Services Certificate of Confi-
dentiality allowed for strict confidentiality regarding all drug
use information, including the 2 states (Florida and Rhode Is-
land) that had mandatory reporting statutes. The certificate did
not, however, circumvent required reporting of child abuse,
sexual abuse, or neglect.
Although recruitment addressed exposure to cocaine and/or
opiates, all analyses presented herein are limited to the cocaine-
only and the non­cocaine-exposed cohorts.
Cocaine exposure was defined by maternal admission of co-
caine use at any time during this pregnancy or a positive enzyme-
multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) screen for cocaine
metabolites in the infant's meconium, confirmed by gas chro-
matography­mass spectroscopy, coupled with a negative EMIT
screen for opiates. All analyses were performed by a central labo-
ratory (El Sohly Laboratories Inc, Oxford, Miss)43 after in-
formed consent was obtained. A history of cocaine use re-
corded in the medical record was not sufficient to qualify as
exposed. Mothers who denied use, but in whom the infant's me-
conium EMIT screen was positive and gas chromatography­
mass spectroscopy analysis was not available, were excluded.44
A nonexposure designation required both a maternal denial of
use and a negative result of meconium screening. There were
3183 infants of consenting mothers whose exposure could not
be determined primarily because of lack of gas chromatography­
mass spectroscopy confirmation. This included 2760 in whom
meconium was unavailable, 254 in whom the quantity of me-
conium collected was insufficient for any analysis, and 169 with
a positive EMIT screen but who had insufficient amounts of me-
conium for gas chromatography­mass spectroscopy confirma-

tion.There was also 1 mother who withdrew consent. None of
the mothers of these infants admitted cocaine use during preg-
nancy. Those mothers excluded because of indeterminate ex-
posure were less likely to be black (47.5% vs 51.6%), were more
likely to be married (40.7% vs 36.6%), and had a higher rate of
preterm birth (7.8% vs 5.7%). As with mothers who refused con-
sent, there were no important differences in their Medicaid in-
surance status, rate of prenatal care, or prevalence of abruptio
placentae. Of the total 1072 infants with known exposure to co-
caine, 717 (66.9%) were known to be exposed only to cocaine
(Figure 1). The remaining cocaine-exposed infants were ex-
cluded as indeterminate. Use of alcohol, marijuana, and/or nico-
tine during pregnancy occurred in both groups (95% of those
exposed, 42% of those nonexposed).
A standardized physical and neurologic examination, made
up of 62 specific items and including the New Ballard Score,45
was performed within the first 24 hours of life by centrally trained
and certified examiners from each site, who were masked to
exposure status. Birth weight, length, and head circumference
were measured and recorded. These same certified research per-
sonnel observed the "acute" course of these infants, which in-
cluded the time from birth to infant death or discharge from
the hospital. Seventy-seven individual conditions and/or diag-
noses were recorded during the hospitalization. Detailed in-
formation on therapies, procedures, resuscitation, the length
of stay, child protective services reporting, and proposed liv-
ing situation was also collected. Information on medications
administered to the mothers at delivery and complications of
labor and delivery were assessed and reported previously.42
To compensate for and to protect against inflated type I er-
ror levels that may be caused by multiple comparisons, we de-
cided a priori to report P.01 as significant in these analyses.
In addition, to reduce the number of reported outcomes and
to eliminate redundancy, information from multiple sources
was combined where this was deemed clinically valid, and out-
comes with a prevalence of less than 1% in the nonexposed co-
hort and that had no occurrence in the cocaine-exposed co-
hort were dropped but are listed in the appropriate table
footnotes. Outcome data were summarized by exposure groups,
using frequency distributions (2 tests) or means and stan-
dard deviations (unpaired 2-tailed t tests) when appropriate.
The estimated odds ratios and 99% confidence intervals are pre-
sented as a summary of the unadjusted relationship between
cocaine-exposure status and each outcome.
Statistically significant (P.01) bivariate associations were
subjected to multivariate modeling to obtain covariate-
adjusted estimates. Linear and logistic regression models were
fitted for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. A stan-
dard set of 10 covariates plus cocaine use, chosen a priori for
all multivariate analyses, was as follows: clinical site; race or
ethnicity; sex; birth weight; being small for gestational age; the
use of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana during pregnancy; ma-
ternal age; and maternal education. Tobacco exposure was cat-
egorized at 3 levels as high use (0.5 pack per day), low use
(any other use), and no use. Alcohol was categorized into 3
groups: alcohol use with bingeing, nonbingeing alcohol use,
and no alcohol use. Marijuana was entered as a simple yes-no
use variable. Race or ethnicity of the mother was based on self-
identification as black, Hispanic, or white/other. Maternal age
was based on whether the mother was 26 years or older, or
younger than 26 years, at the time of delivery. Maternal edu-
cation (12 years or 12 years) was considered a surrogate
for socioeconomic status. Being small for gestational age was
entered into the model to adjust for the enhanced effect of low
birth weight seen primarily in the near-full-term subjects in the
study. Being small for gestational age was based on a birth weight
of less than 10th percentile for gestational age.46
RESULTS
Of the 19 079 women screened, 16 988 (89.0%) were
eligible for recruitment, and 11 811 of those (69.5%) con-
sented (Figure 1). Meconium was analyzed in 8804 in-
fants (74.5%). There were 3184 excluded infants (27.0%).
Meconium quantity was insufficient for any screening
analysis in 2760 and in an additional 254 infants to con-
firm a positive EMIT screen; no meconium was col-
lected in 169 infants, and 1 mother withdrew consent.
Maternal self-report alone identified 7.5% of infants as
cocaine exposed, and meconium analysis identified a 5.0%
exposure rate (Table 1). The total cocaine-exposure rate
was 9.1%. Meconium analysis identified an additional 190

exposed infants (1.6%) not acknowledged by self-
report. Cocaine-exposure rates at the various sites ranged
between 3.7% and 15.2%. The exposure rate in the low-
birth-weight population (2500 g) was more than double
that of normal-birth-weight infants (16.7% vs 6.7%). Of
mothers who admitted cocaine use during pregnancy, me-
conium testing was confirmatory in 66.2% of the cases
where both meconium and self-report were available. Be-
cause maternal admission alone was sufficient to define
an infant as exposed, meconium screens and confirma-
tions were not run on all of these infants. However, as
noted already, an additional 1.6% of exposed infants,
whose mothers denied use during pregnancy, were iden-
tified by meconium analysis.
The 717 infants identified as exposed to cocaine only
(Figure 1) were more often black (78.9% vs 46.3%) and
their mothers were older (79.9% aged 26 years vs
48.3%) than the 7442 subjects in the nonexposed co-
hort (Table 2). The prevalence of prematurity (37
weeks' gestation) was significantly greater in the cocaine-
exposed cohort (42.6% vs 24.2%). Use of tobacco (81.8%
vs 19.7%), alcohol (73.0% vs 30.6%), and marijuana
(39.2% vs 5.0%) were all greater (P.001) in the cocaine-
exposed cohort.
Table 3 lists the prevalence of specific physical find-
ings and physiological observations assessed during the
initial infant examination, as well as diagnoses and/or con-
ditions observed during hospitalization. Abnormal physi-
cal findings were rare, with only tachypnea exceeding a
5% prevalence in either group. Two observations (flat phil-
trum and tachypnea) were significantly more frequent
in the exposed cohort, but not after adjusting for covar-
iates in a multivariable logistic regression model. The di-
agnoses of respiratory distress­transient tachypnea, ap-
nea, retinopathy of prematurity, hepatitis, syphilis, human
immunodeficiency virus­positive status, proven sepsis,
and any infection were significantly more prevalent in the
cocaine-exposed cohort. Hepatitis, syphilis, human im-
munodeficiency virus­positive status, and any infection
remained significant after adjusting for covariates. These
infections,determinedduringthehospitalizationandbased
on laboratory confirmation, were consistent with the in-
fection findings documented in the mothers.42
Several central and autonomic nervous system find-
ings, which included hypertonia, jitteriness or tremors,
high-pitched cry, difficulty arousing, irritability, ex-
cessive suck, and hyperalertness, were noted more
frequently on the initial physical examination in the co-
caine-exposed cohort (Table 4). During the hospital-
ization, the diagnoses of seizures and autonomic insta-
bility were more frequently noted in cocaine-exposed
infants. When adjusted, all of these findings except hy-
pertonia, difficulty arousing, and seizures remained sig-
nificant in the exposed cohort.
More screening and diagnostic echocardiograms of the
heart, abdomen, and head were performed in the ex-
posed cohort (odds ratio, 1.54; 99% confidence interval,
1.01-2.34) (Table 5), explained primarily by lower-birth-
weight infants in that group. In addition, they were or-
dered by the infant's primary caretakers, who were usu-
ally aware of the infant's exposure status as well as the early
literaturethatsuggestedthatanatomicabnormalitiesmight

spite this increased surveillance, no ultrasound diag-
noses were more prevalent in the cocaine-exposed group.
The cocaine-exposed infants were significantly smaller
(P.001) in all growth measures before and after adjust-
ment (Table 6). They were 536 g lighter at birth, were
2.6 cm shorter, and had a 1.5-cm smaller head circum-
ference. Gestational age was significantly lower by 8.4
days (1.2 weeks) in the cocaine-exposed group (as mea-
sured by the revised Ballard examination45). The preva-
lence of being small for gestational age was more than
double in the cocaine-exposed cohort (29.4% vs 13.5%).
The relationship between birth weight and gestational age
is complex. Figure 2 displays that relationship by con-
trasting birth weights at various gestational ages in the 2
study groups on the basis of the birth weight categories
(501-1500, 1501-2500, and 2500 g). The negative effect
of cocaine exposure was most evident in the heavier, later-
gestation infants.
Delivery room resuscitation and intubation occurred
more frequently in the cocaine-exposed infants (Table 7).
Similarly, exposed infants received more therapies and

underwent more procedures, but adjustment for other
explanatory factors eliminated these differences. Cocaine-
exposed infants were less often breastfed even after cor-
recting for the birth weight differences between ex-
posed and nonexposed infants. The increased admissions
of exposed infants to neonatal intensive care or special
care units was again related to the higher prevalence of
low-birth-weight infants in the exposed cohort. There was
no difference in survival (99.6% vs 99.7%), but the du-
ration of hospitalization for infants who died (13.0 vs 56.2
days) was significantly shorter (P=.008) for the cocaine-
exposed infants, again explained primarily by the birth
weight disparity between the 2 groups. Exposed infants
who survived were 48 times more likely to be kept in the
hospital, labeled as "boarder infants," resulting in ex-
tended hospital stays (17.6% vs 0.5%) (Table 7).
Exposed infants were 49 times more likely to be in-
volved with child protective services (38.5% vs 1.0%) and
19 times more often were discharged to the care of some-
one other than their mothers (18.8% vs 1.0%). Mothers
of exposed infants were 6 times more likely to consider
adoption as a permanent placement for their infants (2.1%
vs 0.4%) (Table 8).
COMMENT
The teratogenic and toxic potential of fetal exposure to
cocaine remains controversial. The Maternal Lifestyle
Study attempted to clarify some of the ambiguity sur-
rounding this important public health problem. The
strengths of this study include its large sample size and
extensive training and certification of research teams at
each site to ensure consistency and reliability of both as-
sessments and data collection. The multisite nature of this
collaboration provided a multicultural, multiethnic popu-
lation that included broad-based sociodemographic char-
acteristics. The definition of cocaine-exposure status was

reliable, based on self-report of cocaine use during preg-
nancy or demonstration of cocaine metabolites in meco-
nium by means of state-of-the-art technology performed
by a centralized facility. Testing of meconium, rather than
urine, is hypothesized to reliably detect drug metabolites
over a longer period of use during pregnancy. An addi-
tional 190 cocaine-exposed infants were identified by me-
conium analysis from mothers who denied drug use. There
was no incentive to falsely admit the use of an illegal sub-
stance;however,thereversewasnottrue.Therefore,anega-
tive meconium sample was required for the definition of
nonexposure in mothers who denied use.
The important issues of multiple exposures to alco-
hol, tobacco, and/or marijuana, as well as the level of their
use, were specifically addressed with the multivariate
analyses. Both study cohorts had significant exposures
to these 3 drugs, with more than 40% of the non­cocaine-
exposed mothers also admitting to use. The impact of so-
cioeconomic status and of a drug culture environment
on outcome is complex, but important confounders and
these variables were also addressed in the analyses. Un-
fortunately, not all potential confounders were elimi-
nated. Since consent was required, it remains possible
that particularly heavy users or those who used mul-
tiple drugs might be more likely to refuse participation.
Because mothers were enrolled at or around the time of
delivery, substance use early in pregnancy could have es-
caped detection.
This study contradicts the early reports of an in-
creased prevalence of congenital anomalies. The in-
creased central and autonomic nervous system dysfunc-
tion seen in the exposed cohort was mild, including soft
signs such as irritability, jitteriness, tremors, high-
pitched cry, and excessive suck. Although the cocaine-
exposed cohort included more premature, low-birth-
weight infants, who often exhibit mild, transient
neurologic findings, most of the central nervous system
findings remained significant after adjusting for birth
weight, suggesting a true cocaine effect as reported by
Chiriboga et al.13,16 These rather subtle, acute neuro-
logic findings support the findings of more recent re-
ports, which suggest potential long-term neurodevelop-
mental, behavioral, and learning effects of cocaine
exposure, rather than any acute teratogenic impact. More
ultrasound examinations were ordered by the primary
physician in the exposed cohort. The higher prevalence
of premature infants in the exposed cohort, who have
more complex illnesses, longer hospital stays, and more
diagnostic tests such as echocardiograms, may also help
to explain this difference. It is also true, however, that
the clinicians who ordered these examinations were of-
ten aware of the infant's exposure status as well as the
literature that equated cocaine exposure with the pos-
sible teratogenicity of various organ systems. Of note is
that the ultrasound studies of the head were read cen-
trally by expert ultrasonographers who were masked to
exposure status. However, despite this heightened scru-
tiny, no differential structural abnormalities of the heart,
gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, or brain were docu-
mented by these detailed examinations. These findings
strongly support the conclusion that cocaine has no ob-
vious anatomic teratogenic impact.
All measures of growth were affected by cocaine ex-
posure, and this growth restriction was most evident in
the larger, more mature infants. Growth failure as ges-
tation progresses may relate to the vasoconstrictive im-
pact of cocaine on the normally aging placenta, acceler-
ating its demise and resulting in not only shorter gestations
(prematurity) but also in increasing overall growth in-
hibition (small for gestational age) as term approaches.
An extremely important finding of this study is the in-
creasedprevalenceofinfectiousdiagnoses,particularlysexu-
ally associated infections that were previously reported in
thesemothers.42 Althoughhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus­
positive exposure status had a very low overall prevalence
in this study (0.1%), it occurred almost 16 times more of-
tenininfantsborntococaine-abusingwomen,acleardocu-
mentation of the increased risk of an often fatal infection.
Similarly, a diagnosis of hepatitis occurred about 42 times
more often in cocaine-exposed infants, and syphilis was 15
times as common. The morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with these diseases may have a significant impact on
both health care utilization and long-term developmental
outcome.Theincreaseduseofbothmedical(intensivecare,
procedures, therapies, length of stay, etc) and social (re-
ferralstochildprotectiveservices,adoption,andfostercare)
services by the cocaine-exposed cohort is significant. The
hospital utilization findings are reflective of cocaine's effect
on both gestation and birth weight, whereas the social im-
pact as reflected through child protective services involve-
ment and the infant's living situation is a direct effect of
the mother's cocaine use. The serious infectious expo-
sures associated with prenatal cocaine abuse and the bur-
denandcostimposedonthecriminalandsocialjusticesys-
tems are important short-term outcomes that have obvious
long-term implications and have not been previously ad-
dressed. Being classified as a boarder infant was 48 times
more likely in cocaine-exposed infants, resulting in ex-
tended hospital stays. Cocaine-exposed infants were

Adoption was a seriously considered option for 6 times as
many cocaine-abusing women. The manpower and fiscal
impact of these social risks on society are significant.
Prenatal exposure to cocaine has a different face than
had been previously emphasized. It does not result in ob-
vious and marked fetal damage, but rather, as recent re-
ports suggest, a more subtle impact has evolved.47 Sig-
nificant societal expenditures will continue to be required
to address the social, environmental, and developmen-
tal issues of children born to mothers engaged in the drug
abuser's lifestyle.
Cocaine use by women during pregnancy with result-
ant fetal exposure is preventable, but the degree of dis-
ability that may result from a particular exposure must
be clarified to mobilize resources to respond effectively and
efficiently. Long-term issues regarding the impact of co-
caine exposure on cognition, learning, neurodevelop-
ment, behavior, emotional stability, and potential infec-
tious morbidity are important and clinically relevant. The
MaternalLifestyleStudyiscurrentlyengagedinexamining
these late outcome issues as part of an 11-year follow-up.
