Article
Resilience has been defined as a dynamic, positive adaptation
despite adversity (Reich, Zautra, & Hall, 2010), the ability to
recover from a challenge and pursue the positive (Masten,
2001; Reich et al., 2010; Rutter, 1987), and the ability to
adapt as conditions change (Hamel & Valikangas, 2003;
Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005). Resilience has been viewed as
both a process and an outcome (Zellars, Justice, & Beck,
2011), and research linking resilience to a number of positive
personal outcomes, such as improved mental and physical
health, increased longevity, and decreased heart disease
(Connor, 2003, 2006; Lazarus, 1993; Tugade, Fredrickson, &
Barrett, 2004) as well as professional outcomes (e.g.,
improved overall employee well-being, job satisfaction, and
job performance; Avey, Luthans, Smith, & Palmer, 2010;
Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007; Luthans, Avolio,
Walumbwa, & Li, 2005; Youssef & Luthans, 2007), has
established the construct as an important area of study.
One particular occupation that has gained attention in the
scholarly literature related to resilience is first responders
(Kronenberg et al., 2008; Meadows, Shreffler, & Mullins-
Sweatt, 2011;).First responders, or professionals who deal
with emergencies, natural disasters, and other traumatic
events include police officers, firefighters, and emergency
medical technicians (EMTs) (Meadows et al., 2011). The
nature of these events requires that professionals perform
critical tasks, which may affect mental and physical well-
being. Along with the traumatic experiences that are inherent
to the work, other stressors such as long and irregular shifts,
overnight hours, dangerous environments, and physical
demands contribute additional stressors (Meadows et al.,
2011). Scholars have posited that some first responders
struggle with mental health concerns including depression
(Benedek, Fullerton, & Ursano, 2007), posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD; Benedek et al., 2007), and alcoholism
(Jacobson et al., 2008; Taft et al., 2007) due to the nature of
the work. Physical health injuries that result from workplace
responsibilities can be an additional source of stress (Szubert
& Sobala, 2002).
Given all this information, it seems clear that first respond-
ers have unique work stressors that might require them to
seek support from professionals to cope with the demands
they are experiencing as a professional; however, research
has suggested that first responders struggle with seeking for-
mal assistance for mental health concerns (Crowe, Glass,

A Content Analysis of Psychological
Resilience Among First Responders
and the General Population

Abstract
The current study examined how first responders and the general population described the concept of resilience. Categories
of resilience were coded a priori using Stemler's content analysis. For the general population, positive coping was the
most frequently occurring category followed by social support and adaptability. The next most frequently occurring terms
were societal resources and personal competence. Consistent with the general population, first responders described
resilience most frequently with positive coping. Social support was the next most frequently occurring category, followed
by personal competence, perseverance, emotional regulation, and physical fitness. Although both the general population and
first responder participants highlighted the importance of having a support network, first responders suggested that dealing
with traumatic experiences was more of an individual process, and seeking professional help was not common practice.
Implications for mental health professionals and future directions for research are offered.
Keywords
first responders, psychological resilience, law enforcement, fire and rescue, coping
2 SAGE Open
Raines, Lancaster, & Waggy, 2015; Kronenberg et al., 2008).
In fact, seeking formal help for a mental health concern is
counter to the nature of the first responder culture, as the job
of a responder involves training in emotional and physical
toughness and control (Crowe et al., 2015; Royle, Keenan, &
Farrell, 2009).
Thus, scholars have started to explore how first respond-
ers stay resilient to cope and perform successfully. Although
there is an emergent body of literature on the topic of how
first responders cope with job-related stress and remain resil-
ient, helping professionals, in particular, might benefit from
a deeper understanding of how first responders compare with
the general population in their definition of the concept of
resilience and how they believe it affects their ability to
effectively perform on the job. Such information can better
assist mental health workers in preparing suitable approaches
aimed at helping first responders to effectively deal with the
traumatic experiences they encounter as a result of their
occupational choice. This study was developed as a means to
better inform helping professionals about first responder per-
ceptions of resilience, and how those perceptions affect this
population.
The Current Study
In an effort to understand how first responders define and
understand resilience as it affects them personally and pro-
fessionally, the authors conducted a qualitative investigation
of the perceptions of first responders related to the definition
of resilience. They also investigated whether and how resil-
ience can be increased or decreased over time, as well as how
the concept relates to the work of first responders. This study
allowed for in-depth responses from participants and a
deeper understanding of resilience and the first responder
population. Certainly, the profession of first responders lends
itself to experiences that shape resilience among this group,
because it is well known that the job itself is uniquely ori-
ented to crisis, natural disasters, and dangerousness. Knowing
how this group of professionals define and understand resil-
ience, as compared with those in professions not as closely
associated with these factors, will add to the scholarly under-
standing of the concept of resilience. To the authors' knowl-
edge, this research is the first of its kind to examine how
these two samples'perceptions of resilience might be similar
or different.
Method
The authors conducted a total of four focus groups with
members of two populations of interest, first responders and
the general population. Two group meetings were held with
participants from law enforcement, emergency services, and
fire departments. General population participants attended
two groups that included university staff members from a
university located in the Southeastern United States. The
focus groups were primarily qualitative in nature, with the
exception of a few questions regarding demographics and
mental health history of each participant. Prior to participant
recruitment and data collection, the Institutional Review
Board of the authors' university approved the study
(UMCIRB 13-000259).
Participants
First responders. A total of seven emergency personnel work-
ers participated in the first responder focus groups. There
were four men and three women. Participant age ranged
from 34 to 58 years, with an average age of 40 years (SD =
8.72 years). Six participants reported being Caucasian and
one reported being African American. The majority of par-
ticipants reported being married (n = 6), with the one remain-
ing participant reporting being single, never married.
Participants reported having received either a 4-year (n = 4)
or a 2-year (n = 3) college degree. Occupations included fire
and rescue, paramedic firefighter, and police officer.
The majority of participants indicated that they had previ-
ously sought treatment for a mental health concern (n = 4),
and all those same participants indicated that the treatment
they received was helpful. Reasons for seeking treatment
included alcohol addiction, anxiety, life coaching, and post-
partum depression. Three participants reported that a family
member had a mental illness, including addiction, anxiety,
and depression. The majority of participants also indicated
that they would seek mental health treatment in the future
should they begin to suffer from any symptoms (n = 5).
General population.A total of 10 full-time employees at a
southeastern university participated in the general population
focus groups. There were four men and six women. Partici-
pant age ranged from 27 to 65 years, with an average age of
49.6 years (SD = 11.03 years). Nine participants were Cauca-
sian and one reported being African American. Exactly half
(n = 5) were single, never married, with the other half (n = 5)
reporting being currently married. Half the participants (n =
5) indicated that they had received a master's degree, with
the remaining participants indicating that they had received
either a 4-year (n = 2) or a 2-year (n = 3) college degree.
Occupations included administrative assistant, archivist, lab
compliance coordinator, library technician, student affairs
administration, and maintenance technician, to name a few.
Participants also answered a few mental health history
questions on a mental health history form designed specifi-
cally for this study. The majority of participants indicated
that they had previously sought treatment for a mental health
concern (n = 7), and all those same participants indicated that
the treatment they received was helpful. Reasons for seeking
treatment included anxiety, bipolar disorder, past trauma
experience, depression, family concerns, and relationship
issues. The majority of the group also indicated that they had
a family member with a mental illness (n = 7). These family
Crowe et al. 3
illnesses included alcoholism, depression, anxiety, bipolar
disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The majority of par-
ticipants also indicated that they would seek mental health
treatment in the future should they begin to suffer from any
symptoms (n = 7).
Procedures
Participants were recruited from an email listserv.
Participation was voluntary and no incentives were provided.
The authors conducted initial phone screenings to verify that
all participants met the required criteria for inclusion.
Participants were asked whether they were at least 18 years
of age and felt comfortable discussing attitudes toward men-
tal health. Participants who answered yes to these questions
were eligible to participate. Focus groups were conducted in
a conference room located at a researcher's office building.
All participants completed an informed consent before par-
ticipating in the research. Next, each participant completed a
short demographic form and a mental health history ques-
tionnaire prior to the start of discussion. Focus groups lasted
anywhere from 60 to 90 min and all were directed by use of
a predesigned question script. Discussions were audio
recorded and later transcribed for ease of analysis.
Demographic information included age, gender, ethnic back-
ground, relationship status, level of education, and current
occupation. For mental health history, sample questions
included, "Have you ever sought treatment for a mental
health concern?" "Was the treatment you received helpful?"
"What did you seek treatment for?" and "Do you have some-
one in your family with a mental illness?" First responders
also answered questions such as "Can you describe the types
of stressors that you face on the job?" and "What types of
emergency situations have you dealt with in your job?"
Focus group discussion concentrated on psychological
resilience. Topics covered included the definition of resil-
ience and what it means for a person to be resilient, where
resilience originates, how and if it can be developed, and
where resilience might be tested. Sample questions included,
"In your own words, what do you think it means for someone
to be resilient?" and "What experiences or situations may
cause someone to become less resilient?"
Results
Data Analysis
Key study questions included (a) how first responders and the
general population define resilience, (b) how first responders
and the general population understand innate and learned
resilience, (c) how first responders and the general population
describe life experiences that cause more or less resilience,
(d) what first responders and the general population describe
as protective and risk factors for resilience, (e) how first
responders believe the term applies to their profession, and (f)
how first responders describe the relationship between
increasing resilience and coping with stressful or traumatic
events.
Transcribed versions of the focus group discussions were
used to analyze the data. All statements made by participants
during the discussions were used as unique quotes. The
authors followed Stemler's (2001) content analysis proce-
dures using an a priori coding strategy. Through this
approach, the authors began with a preestablished set of cod-
ing categories that were based on previously published
research and theoretical descriptions of resilience. The initial
set of codes was revised following the preliminary rounds of
data analysis (Stemler, 2001). Three members of the research
team coded each statement as representative of one factor of
resilience. These potential factors were based on an a priori
review of the literature regarding known factors of resilience.
This list was finalized following a pilot test round where all
members of the research team coded a subset of data.
The following 10 factors were used to code the data: posi-
tive coping (Meredith et al., 2011), optimism (conceptual-
ized from positive thinking and positive affect; Meredith
et al., 2011), social support (reflected in The Resilience Scale
for Adults; conceptualized from emotional ties, communica-
tion, support, closeness, nurturing, and connectedness;
Meredith et al., 2011; definition via Lin, Simeone, Ensel, &
Kuo, 1979; National Cancer Institute, 2014; Ozbay et al.,
2007), belongingness (Meredith et al., 2011), personal com-
petence (Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge, & Martinussen,
2003), emotional regulation (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004),
adaptability (Meredith et al., 2011), Perseverance (n.d.,
Merriam-WebsterDictionary),societalresources(Donenfeld,
1940), and physical fitness (Meredith et al., 2011).
When all three coders agreed on a factor, the agreed-upon
code became the final code. When only two coders agreed on
a factor, the final code was the one on which both agreed.
Statements that resulted in disagreement between all three
reviewers resulted in the statement being coded into the
"other/no code" category. A total of 141 statements were
coded by each coder, resulting in a total of 423 coded state-
ments. The authors calculated the interrater reliability for
these coded statements, which resulted in an overall percent-
age of agreement of 85.8% and a Fleiss' kappa statistic of
.600, indicating moderate agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977).
Resilience and general population results.Within the general
population sample, 133 statements were coded according to
resilience categories. The most common category of resil-
ience expressed by participants was positive coping. A total
of 34 statements were coded in this category. This factor
included active/pragmatic, problem-focused, and spiritual
approaches to coping, and was defined by the researchers as
the process of managing taxing circumstances, expending
effort to solve personal and interpersonal problems, and
seeking help to reduce or tolerate stress or conflict (Meredith
et al., 2011). A statement that describes the concept of
4 SAGE Open
positive coping was as follows: "Integrating or teaching the
skills to people to integrate support structures helps to build
a stronger framework to assist in their resilience . . . from
better nutrition to decreased stress, ways of coping with
stress . . . ." General population participants mentioned cop-
ing skills directly, as well as things that help individuals cope
such as faith, pets, and other outlets. Positive coping was also
discussed when participants were asked about being born
resilient. One individual stated, "I see it having a lot to do
with nurture. In some ways, you would be taught different
ways to cope and work through things."
The next most commonly occurring categories of resil-
ience were social support and adaptability.Atotal of 22 state-
ments were coded in each of these categories. Social support
was defined as support accessible to an individual through
social ties to other individuals, groups, and the larger com-
munity (Lin et al., 1979). Participants commented on per-
sonal experiences of social support including, "I think that
there is a support network . . . you show them the resources
they have and then the next time they are able to do that on
their own" and "a safety net . . . where parents or teachers or
very understanding bosses can create a context where . . .
failure can be used to give strength to push forward." These
social support experiences were mainly discussed when par-
ticipants were asked about what causes people to become
more or less resilient over time.
Adaptability, defined as positive adaptation to life
changes, was described in statements such as, ". . . you can
be restored to this previous position rather quickly" and ". . .
restore oneself to a position of balance, whatever that bal-
ance was before the episode or incident." Finally, many par-
ticipants used the term flexible when describing resilience.
The term societal resources was the next most frequently
occurring, with 13 statements coded as such. For the purposes
of this research, the factor was defined as access to resources
that are out of the immediate control of the individual. Most
discussion involving this factor was around a lack of societal
resources, which subsequently placed strain on an individual
and tested resilience. One participant stated, "Resilience is
related to the resources you have around you . . . and you wear
those resources out. Emotional, financial, whatever resources
are worn out, you can't bounce back anymore." In addition,
societal resources were attributed to risk factors of resilience,
specifically, " . . . the lack of resources, or the lack of the abil-
ity to connect to resources . . . " as well as protective factors
such as, "socioeconomic factors, like level of education, edu-
cation attainment of parents, level of income in your house-
hold . . . ." Furthermore, affluence was seen as both a potential
protective and risk factor for resilience. One participant
attested the following, "higher income . . . my guess would be
that in general that leads to people dealing with trauma better
. . ." whereas another participant stated, ". . . if someone has
been raised affluent . . . they've been coddled their whole life
. . . they completely fall apart. They've been protected, they
have not actually had to deal . . . ."
Eleven statements were coded as personal competence,
which includes self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-liking, deter-
mination and a realistic orientation to life (Friborg, Hjemdal,
Rosenvinge, & Martinussen, 2003). This factor was cited as
a characteristic of being resilient and most often associated
with being "strong." For example, one participant stated that
trainees over time, if given tools and models and examples and
(being) incrementally exposed to increasing amounts of stress . . .
begin to build confidence and see that what they once thought
were insurmountable obstacles can be overcome and actually
can be turned to a positive experience to build your inner
strengths and capabilities to better prepare you for future events.
Nine statements were coded as perseverance, defined as
continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficul-
ties, failure, or opposition. Multiple participants discussed
the lack of this factor with regard to a cause for being less
resilient. For example, "You could be knocked down how
many times before you learn to stay down."
Seven statements were coded in each of the following cat-
egories: optimism, emotional regulation, and physical fit-
ness. The researchers defined optimism as feeling
enthusiastic, active, and alert, including positive emotions,
hope, and flexibility about change. It also includes informa-
tion processing through positive reframing, making sense out
of a situation and refocusing with a positive outlook and
expectations. One participant discussed being born resilient
in the following way: "I'm thinking of some people that I
know who are very upbeat all the time and they seem to han-
dle things pretty well."
Emotional regulation includes attempts to influence the
types of emotions experienced, and when and how they are
expressed and experienced. It may involve changes in the
quality or intensity of emotional experiences, as well as the
regulation or maintenance of affective experiences (Tugade
& Fredrickson, 2004). For instance, one participant stated,
I know people who are very emotionally stable, but who are very
passionate about their work and it's just when something bad
happens, they don't flip out. They just go, okay, something bad
happened, I'm going to go and deal with it and get this out of the
way and go on.
The researchers conceptualized physical fitness as a state
of health and well-being including exercise, nutrition,
hygiene, and rest (Meredith et al., 2011). It may include spe-
cific abilities to perform aspects of an occupation (i.e., car-
diovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular endurance). This
factor was mentioned mainly in the context of helping build
or diminish resilience. For example, with regard to making
one become less resilient, a participant mentioned that, ". . .
illness in general. I think part of that is mental health as well.
You could become depressed and then have trouble, and you
wouldn't be quite as resilient . . . ." Another participant said,
". . . sleep deprivation and health can degrade your resilience
Crowe et al. 5
because it affects your ability to put things into that
perspective."
The belongingness factor included only one statement.
This concept was defined as cohesion, friendships, group
membership, including participation in spiritual/faith-based
organizations, ceremonies, social services, and schools
(Meredith et al., 2011). This factor was discussed similarly to
a support group in a faith-based organization as follows:
Our church has a group called grief share . . . (including) widows
and widowers recently that are trying to cope with a very
difficult situation and there are people at different stages in that
process, but by coming together not unlike many other support
group situations, like situations with . . . people that have walked
that path before . . . .
Resilience and first responders results. For the sample of first
responders, a total of 82 statements were coded according to
resilience categories. The largest portion of participants'
statements was categorized as positive coping. Specifically,
16 statements were coded in this category. In general, this
factor represented the process of applying beneficial prac-
tices, such as problem-focused coping (Meredith et al., 2011)
to resolve feelings of stress or conflict. Furthermore, positive
coping was considered to be a process utilized by resilient
individuals. The following statement provided by one of the
first responder participants illustrates the concept of positive
coping:
If a person is wanting to get better, they need to pick a certain
time in their life that just stands out in their mind where they
were either really happy or really successful at something and
have it as a positive motivator in their head. I can get back to
this, I can do this, I can get there.
In addition, first responder participants provided succinct
descriptors of positive coping such as "avenues for relief"
and made statements such as "humor is a huge one," when
referencing specific types of positive coping. Finally, when
asked to describe what it means to be resilient, one partici-
pant noted positive coping's relationship with resilience by
stating, "the ability to cope with life's ups and downs . . .
including the professional and personal life."
The next most frequently occurring category of resilience
was social support. Thirteen statements were coded as social
support including,
a positive, loving environment at home. Kids will thrive when
they are loved and feel love and are shown love and they
reciprocate love . . . that kind of healthy environment will help
them grow and develop as opposed to the opposite.
Furthermore, comments highlighting the benefit of a positive
home life suggested that resilience was fostered through
social support. Such comments included,
When you have that person that you can go home to . . . hang up
the coat, so to speak, and be able to let your guard down and be
in a condition where you have that moment to relax and let
somebody care for you.
Finally, other participants mentioned the importance of hav-
ing "a support system" and "positive role models," when
describing social support's role in resilience.
Personal competence was the next most frequently used
category of resilience, including 12 statements. Personal
competence was defined as having personal feelings of self-
esteem, self-efficacy, and possessing a realistic orientation
toward life (Friborg, 2003). A statement that demonstrates
personal competence includes, "Being able to withstand
pressure. When you are put under pressure, some people
focus and some people fold, and I think (people) who last
long and do well are those that can focus." Another example
of personal competence includes, "I always had a certain
amount of confidence that kind of helped me get over what-
ever it was."
Following, perseverance was the next most frequently
used category of resilience, including 11 statements. A state-
ment that illustrates the category of perseverance includes,
"You are going to have highs and lows and you're going to
have situations, but with all the craziness . . . kind of keep a
base and continue to go. Stamina is a good word."
Furthermore, when speaking about resilient individuals, one
participant stated, "A certain percentage (of individuals), no
matter what you do to them, they will always continue."
Finally, some words and phrases that were used by partici-
pants that were categorized as perseverance included, "sur-
vival," "tough," and "bounce back."
Eight statements were categorized in both emotional reg-
ulation and physical fitness categories. Emotional regulation
was defined as an individual's ability to modify various
aspects of emotional experience (Tugade & Fredrickson,
2004). An example of a statement regarding emotional regu-
lation includes,
A lot of times we see resilience equals emotionless and so what
happens is you never know how to turn it back on . . . in order to
be resilient, in order to deal, is to turn off completely in every
aspect of your life just to make sure you get through. In my
mind, resiliency is not that, it's being able to actually deal with
the situation and be able to process, learn something from it, and
move on.
An example of a statement regarding physical fitness
includes,
There are people that are more physically fit, that are less shaky,
are less nervous, or at least able to control it better. Everyone
gets tunnel vision, but those who have more physical fitness
tend to breathe and open that (tunnel vision) back up at a better
rate than somebody who is not as physically fit.
6 SAGE Open
The next most frequently occurring categories were
adaptability and belongingness, with seven and six state-
ments in each category, respectively. Regarding adaptability,
when discussing resilience as a learned characteristic, one
participant stated,
Some things are instinctive. The will to survive might be
instinctive but then you can learn how to, maybe by modeling,
something an adult would model, or your environment would
allow you to model, how to adapt and adjust. I think you can
learn and sharpen those skills.
In addition, the following statement illustrated the concept of
belongingness:
I think that many of us in our job rely on that. We crave it. That's
one of the reasons that we got into this job to begin with . . . we
really love the camaraderie and the brotherhood that we try to
make. We have each other to rely on and that makes us a lot
stronger than individuals.
Finally, a single statement was categorized as optimism.
Optimism was defined by feelings of enthusiasm, hopeful-
ness, and alertness. The statement that was best categorized
as optimism included,
A positive mindset. My instruction and expertise has always
been in the tactical realm . . . and mindset is what we train for as
much as anything else. The no quit attitude . . . the roof is caving
in on me from the fire perspective and I'm not going to let that
stop me, I'm going to get out and get my team out. That's a form
of resiliency.
Discussion
Police officers, firefighters, and EMTs perform a variety of
tasks that can greatly affect their mental and physical well-
being. Given that first responders operate in environments
that inherently are stressful, it is important to examine how
these professionals stay resilient to gain a better understand-
ing of how they are able to effectively cope with various situ-
ations and perform successfully. For persons in helping
professions, the data gathered through these focus groups
give a glimpse into the perceptions of first responders, as
well as the general population as they relate to resilience and
surviving in the workplace.
There were a number of commonalities between first
responders and the general population in the way that they
described resilience. Positive coping, or using strategies to
reduce stress and solve problems, was the most frequently
occurring factor in both samples. This seems to suggest that
regardless of occupation, there is a belief that one can cope
with adversity with internal or external strategies mecha-
nisms to be resilient. Both groups also believed that social
support, or social ties such as friends and family can affect
resilience. Personal competence or belief in oneself also was
mentioned by both groups. For mental health professionals
who might work with people to increase resilience, discus-
sion about positive ways of coping, building or maintaining
a support network, and raising self-efficacy might assist with
increasing resilience.
In addition to the commonalities, there were a number of
interesting distinctions in how the two samples understood
the term resilience. One important point of discussion is that
the characteristics identified by first responders did not
include the desire to process these traumatic events with a
helping professional. It is important for mental health profes-
sionals to recognize the unique nature of first responder
occupations and approach working with this population with
an appreciation for the occupational hazards that are com-
mon with this group. This uniqueness separates these work-
ers from those in the general population, and the difference
in the way the two groups perceive resiliency is an important
distinction to keep in mind.
Through the study, it became clear that first responders
believed that positive coping is a process that resilient indi-
viduals use to deal with occupational stressors. The partici-
pants identified a variety of ways that stress can be dealt with
including humor and positive thinking. As a group, first
responders suggested that dealing with work stressors is sim-
ply something that persons in their positions must learn to
do. The assumption then is that first responders believe that
traumatic events and work stress should be dealt with indi-
vidually, and that to survive in the job, they must learn inter-
nal coping mechanisms. When asked about dealing with
these traumatic events, the participants did not readily iden-
tify counseling or professional helping relationships as an
effective way of working through such issues.
First responders also highlighted the importance of hav-
ing a support system to help with resilience. A common
theme that was evident through this study's focus groups is
that first responders understand the value of having a posi-
tive, supportive environment outside of work. This is not to
suggest that having a support system at work is not benefi-
cial; however, participants specifically discussed the home
environment as a place where they could "let their guard
down" and have the opportunity to relax. Specifically, allow-
ing another person to care for them was helpful after so much
of their work time was focused on helping others in various
levels of need. However, the first responders in our study did
not identify talking about their specific stressors, or process-
ing their traumatic experiences as being important to stay
resilient. In fact, first responders highlighted the ability to
remain emotionless in the face of trauma as being an effec-
tive way to deal with work experiences.
Although both first responders and the general population
discussed the importance of social support in relation to
resilience, their notions of social support was vastly differ-
ent. Those in the general population referred to social sup-
port as a way to share resources so that people are able to
learn from each other. This implies a sharing of information
Crowe et al. 7
and a discussion of some personal information. While first
responders also highlighted the importance of social support,
they tended to view that as a place to feel accepted and relax,
but did not imply that there was any discussion regarding the
traumatic events at work. It would seem that first responders
appreciate a supportive environment where they can detach
from the world of work, but not necessarily have to deal with
any of the horrors they may face through their jobs. This
finding might demonstrate that first responders struggle with
sharing their reactions to these events as a way to cope or that
this style of coping is simply a means of avoiding stressors
without effectively dealing with any of them. If this is the
case, then it would seem likely that at some point, the stress-
ors would increase and perhaps lead to greater mental health
or psychosomatic health concerns. It is also interesting to
note that the general population referred to societal resources
a number of times, however this term was not found in the
focus groups with first responders. This suggests that the
general population understands the value of accessing
resources that are out of the immediate control of the indi-
vidual. However, first responders did not mention societal
resources implying that this population believes the develop-
ment of resilience is more of personal process, and that the
utilization of outside resources is either not needed, or not
viewed as a positive within that community.
Limitations
A few limitations are noteworthy related to this study. Many
participants (both first responder as well as those who were
in the general population subgroup) had some experience
related to mental health concerns, either personally or with
someone in their family. This could affect attitudes as well as
resilience. Some of our participants also indicated that they
had sought professional support for a mental health concern,
or stressor related to work or personal life and that they had
felt positively about this experience. Perhaps resilience lev-
els and perceptions of the concept of resilience are different
for those who have been touched in some way with a mental
health concern, and affected by seeking professional help. In
addition, this study used a focus group design, which lends
itself to gathering a large amount of data in a short amount of
time; however, participant responses can be affected by what
is being shared by others in the focus group. Although the
focus group leader made every effort to allow each partici-
pant to share his or her unique perceptions, the very nature of
focus group design includes this threat.
Implications for Future Research
This research explored perceptions of general population
members as well as first responders as they related to the
notion of resilience. The qualitative design allowed for the
research team to unveil attitudes and uncover content related
to how these two groups defined the concept and related it to
personal and professional experiences. Future scholars might
continue this line of inquiry with large-scale, quantitative
investigations so that group differences can be explored.
When looking at the ways that the two samples (first respond-
ers and general population) defined the concept of resilience,
there were noteworthy differences in addition to some simi-
larities. For the general population, positive coping was the
most frequently occurring category followed by social sup-
port and adaptability. Consistent with the general population,
first responders described resilience most frequently with
positive coping. Social support was the next most frequently
occurring category, followed by personal competence, perse-
verance, emotional regulation, and physical fitness.Although
both the general population and first responder participants
highlighted the importance of having a support network, first
responders suggested that dealing with traumatic experi-
ences was more of an individual process, and seeking profes-
sional help was not common practice. Future studies can
continue to explore how first responders cope with the nature
of their work, so that professionals as well as those in their
personal networks can best support them.
Conclusion
First responders are tasked with difficult jobs that often
require an individual to work and perform in the face of tre-
mendous stressors and traumatic events. It would seem that
everyone would benefit from having such individuals be as
resilient as possible, so that they are able to perform effec-
tively while maintaining a healthy mental and physical bal-
ance in their lives outside of work. As helping professionals,
it is important to keep in mind the unique characteristics of
these occupations as we seek to provide these individuals
with quality care. Mental health professionals have the
potential to reach this population, educate them on the ben-
efits of seeking counseling, and help them better understand
the positives that can be found through utilizing such ser-
vices. Furthermore, mental health professionals must also
understand the unique culture of the profession to understand
how to effectively work with this client population. This
study highlighted differences as well as similarities in the
perceptions of resilience among first responders and the gen-
eral population. Positive coping, social support, and personal
competence were mentioned in both samples as part of what
comprises resilience. A noteworthy difference was that first
responders seemed to conceptualize resilience as an individ-
ual characteristic not necessarily requiring the use of outside
resources. Until strides are made to change these percep-
tions, it seems unlikely that first responders will take the step
to seek professional support, further isolating these persons
to deal with these stressors alone. In turn, it is clear that help-
ing professionals must begin to reach out to such populations
to both educate and care for our first responders, who persis-
tently care for and protect the population at large, despite
constant threats to their personal well-being.
