Abstract
Background: Recently low dose organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been strongly linked to various chronic diseases
including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Both field and animal studies have suggested a possibility that persistent
lipophilic chemicals like OC pesticides can cause vitamin D deficiency, but there have been no human studies of exposure to
any chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency. This study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of
OC pesticides were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the U.S. general population.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Cross-sectional associations of serum OC pesticides with serum 25(OH)D were
investigated in 1,275 subjects aged $20 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES), 2003­2004.
We selected 7 OC pesticides detectable in $80% of participants. Among the 7 OC pesticides, p,p9-DDT (b = 20.022, P,0.01),
p,p9-DDE (b = 20.018, P = 0.04), and b-hexachlorocyclohexane (b = 20.022, P = 0.02) showed significant inverse associations
with serum 25(OH)D levels. When study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the presence of various chronic diseases,
p,p9-DDT showed consistent inverse associations in all subgroups, although stronger associations tended to be observed
among subjects with old age, white race, or chronic diseases.
Conclusion/Significance: The current study suggests that the background exposure to some OC pesticides leads to vitamin
D deficiency in human. Considering the importance of vitamin D deficiency in the development of chronic diseases,
chemical exposure as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency should be evaluated in prospective and experimental studies.

Introduction
In the past, the major health problems resulting from vitamin D
deficiency were rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1].
Recently there has been intense interest in the role of vitamin D in
a variety of nonskeletal medical conditions. Indeed, vitamin D
deficiency has been associated with increases in cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and infection [1]. At present, despite controversy
over the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficient serum
vitamin D levels is very common in the general population [2,3].
Recently, vitamin D supplementation has been recommended and
widely applied with the intention of preventing many diseases
related to vitamin D deficiency [4,5].
Sunlight exposure is the primary determinant of vitamin D
status in humans. Therefore, the control against sun exposure
through avoidance and sun protection has been regarded as a
main cause of increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency [6]. In
addition, decreased outdoor activity and obesity has been also
associated with vitamin D deficiency [6].
To our best knowledge, there have been no studies of exposure
to any chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency in
human. However, there was an interesting field study which
observed clear inverse associations of hepatic load of DDT and
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with circulating 1,25-dihydrox-
yvitamin D3
(1,25(OH)2
D) status in grey seals in the Baltic Sea [7].
DDT and PCBs are chemicals which are Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs). POPs include a variety of chemicals such as
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated di-
benzofurans (PCDFs), PCBs, and organochlorines (OC) pesticides,
and have common properties like resistance to environmental
degradation, lipophilicity, and bioaccumulation in food chain.
Supporting the observation from the field study, a couple of
animal studies reported that the exposure to PCBs decreased levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) and 1,25(OH)2
D [8,9].
In fact, there has been emerging evidence strong relations
between the background exposure to POPs and various diseases
including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases
[10,11,12,13]. As well-known endocrine disruptors, it is possible
that exposure to POPs can affect metabolism of vitamin D,
because vitamin D is a hormone.
This study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of
POPs were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydro-

xyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) in the U.S. general population, as
represented in subsamples of the National Health and Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 2003­2004. Although we examined
various kinds of POPs, there was no reportable association with
POPs belonging to subclasses of PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs. As
only POPs belonging to OC pesticides showed interesting
associations with serum concentrations of 25-(OH)D, we report
results on OC pesticides here.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) was designed to be nationally representative of
the non-institutionalized U.S. population. This report is a cross-
sectional study using the NHANES data 2003­2004 collected
between January 2003 and December 2004. For NHANES 2003­
2004, 12,761 persons were selected for the sample, 10,122 of those
were interviewed, and 9,643 were examined in the Mobile
Examination Center (MEC). OC pesticides were measured in
2,337 subsamples of persons 12 years and over. Among 1,585
persons aged 20 or more, the final sample size was 1,275 after
excluding pregnant women and subjects without information on
OC pesticides and serum vitamin D levels. The study protocol was
reviewed and approved by the CDC institutional review board;
additionally, informed written consent was obtained from all
subjects before they took part in the study.
Measurements
Venous blood samples were collected in the MEC and shipped
weekly to laboratories at 220uC. Thirteen organochlorine
pesticides were measured in serum by high-resolution gas
chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrom-
etry (HRGC/ID-HRMS). We selected the 7 organochlorine
pesticides for which at least 80% of study subjects had
concentrations.LOD; p,p9-DDE, p,p9-DDT, b-hexachlorocyclo-
hexane, Dieldrin, Hexachlorobenzene, Oxychlordane, and Trans-
nonachlor.
Serum 25-(OH)D was measured by the Diasorin 25-(OH)D
assay, which consists of a two-step procedure. The first procedure
is an extraction of 25-(OH)D and other hydroxylated metabolites
from serum, followed by an equilibrium Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
procedure based on a specific antibody to 25-(OH)D.
Statistical analyses
Adjusted means of serum 25-(OH)D levels across 5 categories of
serum concentrations of POPs were examined by General Linear
Models. Serum concentrations of OC pesticides were categorized
into quintiles and the last quintile was further divided into two
groups using the median values of each OC pesticides as OC
pesticides showed very right-skewed distributions. We also used
summary measure of OC pesticides by summing individual rank of
each OC pesticide and the sum was categorized using the same
method as with the individual OC pesticides. Serum 25-(OH)D
levels were log transformed because they also showed a right-
skewed distribution. In addition, we used General Additive Models
to check the possibility of a non-linear spline across the whole
range of serum concentrations of OC pesticides.
Adjusting variables were sex, age (years), race, body mass index
(continuous), smoking status (never, former, current), outdoor
activities (continuous, total frequency of walked or bicycled as part
of getting to and from work, or school, or to do errands per day
during recent 1 month), and vitamin D supplementation
(continuous, total amount of vitamin D intake by supplement
during recent 1 month).
As POPs levels were very different depending on age or race,
stratified analyses by age (,60 vs. $60 years) or race (white vs.
non-white) were performed to see if there were consistent patterns.
In addition, we also performed stratified analyses by the status of
presence of self-reported common chronic diseases (coronary heart
diseases, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, stroke, emphy-
sema, bronchitis, chronic liver diseases, thyroid diseases, cancer,
hypertension, diabetes, or kidney diseases) because serum
concentrations of vitamin D are associated with various clinical
conditions.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.1 and
SUDAAN 9.0. Estimates of main results were calculated
accounting for stratification and clustering [14], adjusting for
age, race and ethnicity, and poverty income ratio instead of using
sample weights; this adjustment has been regarded as a good
compromise between efficiency and bias [14,15]. As results were
very similar with SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0, we present the
results based on SAS 9.1.
Results
The sample of 1,275 participants included 50.1% men and
52.9% non-Hispanic white. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of
demographics, health behaviors, and other characteristics by
quintiles of p,p9-DDT, one of OC pesticides which showed
strongest associations with serum 25-(OH)D level. Subjects with
high serum concentrations of p,p9-DDT were older, more obese,
non-white race, and non-smoker, compared with those with low
serum concentrations of p,p9-DDT. They had also higher
prevalence of hypertension or diabetes. Other OC pesticides
showed similar associations with covariates as did p,p9-DDT (data
not shown).

Organochlorine Pesticides and Vitamin D
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30093
Among 7 OC pesticides, p,p9-DDT, p,p9-DDE, and b-
hexachlorocyclohexane showed significant inverse associations
with serum 25-(OH)D (P,0.01) (Table 2). Whenever there were
significant associations, the decreases of serum 25-(OH)D levels
were particularly prominent in the last category of OC pesticides,
belonging to the highest 10% of study subjects. Based on beta-
cofficients, the stronger associations were observed with p,p9-DDT
and b-hexachlorocyclohexane rather than p,p-DDE. When we
used the summary measure of 3 OC pesticides which showed
significant inverse associations, the strength of association seemed
to be a little stronger than individual OC pesticides.
When study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the
presence of various chronic diseases, p,p9-DDT showed consistent
inverse associations in all subgroups (Table 3). However, stronger
associations tend to be observed among subjects at least 60 years
old or having chronic disease, although none of the p values for
interaction reached statistical significance. Similar to the results for
p,p9-DDT, both p,p-DDE and b-hexachlorocyclohexane showed
significant or marginally significant inverse associations with serum
25-(OH)D levels only among older subjects or those with chronic
disease.
When we fitted non-linear relationships, the U-shaped pattern
was observed with p,p9-DDT (Figure 1). Even though the
association between p,p9-DDT and 25-(OH)D appeared to be
linear when we used the traditional quintile approach, the linear
inverse association persisted only until about 200 ng/g lipid of
p,p9-DDT (the 99th percentile was 154 ng/g, as indicated on
Figure 1). For higher values, 25-(OH)D appeared to increase,
making the U-shaped association.
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study, we observed significant inverse
associations between serum concentrations of several OC
pesticides, p,p9-DDT, p,p9-DDE, and b-hexachlorocyclohexane,
and serum 25-(OH)D levels among the U.S. general population.
To our best knowledge, this is the first study that linked OC
pesticides and serum 25-(OH)D levels in human.
In fact, both POPs like OC pesticides and vitamin D deficiency
have been associated with a variety of chronic diseases in general
populations, but these two important factors have been separately
studied by researchers in different fields. As field and animal
studies observed that the exposure to POPs can disturb the
metabolism of vitamin D [7,8,9], we hypothesized that a similar
pattern existed in human.
In fact, there were strong positive correlations among serum
concentrations of p,p9-DDT, p,p9-DDE, and b-hexachlorocyclo-
hexane (p,p9-DDT vs p,p9-DDE = +0.72; p,p9-DDT vs. b-
hexachlorocyclohexane = +0.56; p,p9-DDE vs. b-hexachlorocyclo-
hexane = +0.66). Compared with other OC pesticides evaluated in
this study, serum concentrations of these three OC pesticides were
more strongly correlated with each other in this population.
Therefore, even if there is a causal relationship between vitamin D
concentration and one or more POPs, it is difficult to know if all 3

of these OC pesticides are really involved in the disturbance of
metabolism of vitamin D based on the epidemiological findings.
Both p,p9-DDT and p,p-DDE are closely related because p,p9-
DDT breaks down to p,p9-DDE, an extremely stable compound in
the environment, that resists further environmental breakdown or
metabolism by organisms [16]. Therefore, even though DDT was
banned several decades ago in most developed countries, nearly all
U.S. residents have substantial amounts of p,p9-DDE in their
bodies. This persisting exposure is owing to the extreme stability of
p,p9-DDE and continuous exposure to p,p9-DDE through food
consumption, because our current food chain on earth is seriously
contaminated with POPs [17]. In this study, stronger and more
consistent patterns were observed with p,p-DDT in subgroup
analyses as well as analyses based on all subjects than p,p9-DDE.
Importantly, DDT is still used for malaria control in Central
America, South America, Mexico, Africa and some developing
countries in Asia [18]. It may explain why non-white race had a
higher concentration of DDT compared with white race.
b-hexachlorocyclohexane is an isomer of technical hexachloro-
cyclohexane and byproduct of the production of the insecticide
Lindane [19]. Technical hexachlorocyclohexane and Lindane
were among the most extensively used OC pesticides produced
mainly after the Second World War until the 1990s [20]. They
have not been produced in the U.S. since 1976, but imported
Lindane is available as insecticide or prescription medicine to treat
scabies and head lice in humans [19]. Even though India is the
only country known where Lindane is currently produced, some
developing countries had produced Lindane until very recently
[21].
In fact, it is well-known that chronic exposure to DDT causes
thin avian egg shells which is one factor in the decrease in
population of certain avian species [22]. Thinning egg shells is
closely related to calcium metabolism which is largely regulated by
two steroids, estradiol and vitamin D [22]. Although it has long
been suspected that DDT disturbs the metabolism of vitamin D,
early experimental studies in 1960s or 70s failed to show that DDT
disturb vitamin D metabolism [23,24,25].
However, this issue needs to be reevaluated with low doses of
DDT similar to environmental exposure because the doses of
DDT used in early experimental studies were very high. If DDT
disturbs hormone metabolism, including vitamin D, this distur-
bance would likely happen due to endocrine disrupting properties
rather than toxicity of DDT. In the case of endocrine disruptors,
dose-response curves are often nonmonotonic and low dose levels
are more relevant to biological effects than high dose levels [26]. In
our previous epidemiological studies on POPs in relation to
various chronic diseases, we have observed apparent low dose
effects of POPs. POPs could be involved in the pathogenesis of
these diseases through endocrine disrupting properties of POPs
[11,13].
The results based on traditional linear modeling and category
approaches showed a decrease of vitamin D mainly among
subjects with the upper 10% of p,p-DDT with the significant p
value for linear trend, However, when we fitted the dataset using a

Organochlorine Pesticides and Vitamin D

General Additive Model, we observed non-linearity of p,p9-DDT,
making the U-shaped association. The decrease of vitamin D was
mainly observed up until the subjects had p,p9-DDT of 200 ng/g
lipid, above which vitamin D showed an increasing trend with the
increase of p,p9-DDT. As p,p9-DDT had a very skewed
distribution, the interquartile range of p,p9-DDT was only
3.3,9.5 ng/g lipid, but about 1% of subjects had p,p9-DDT
levels $154 ng/g and the highest value was 676 ng/g lipid.
Therefore, the increasing trend of vitamin D was mainly driven by
only a very small number of subjects with very high p,p9-DDT in
this sample who had largely background exposure to the pesticide.
Similar to our previous findings on POPs [11,13], this kind of
dose-response relation may be explained by endocrine disrupting
properties of p,p9-DDT. However, the possibility of increasing
trend of vitamin D among persons with high p,p9-DDT needs to
be confirmed in further studies with sufficient sample sizes.
There are several limitations. First of all, we cannot rule out
reverse causality as this study is cross-sectional. However, we are
not aware of mechanisms whereby higher vitamin D level would
help to clear serum concentrations of OC pesticides. Also, field
findings on POPs and vitamin D levels suggest the possibility that
OC pesticides influence vitamin D metabolism. Second, serum
concentrations of 25(OH)D are affected by sunlight exposure, and
vary by season, time of outdoor activity, and residence latitude.
Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are highest in the summer and
the fall and are lowest in the spring. This seasonal variation limits
the usefulness of single measurements, and requires an average
concentration throughout the year or at least a seasonal
adjustment. Unfortunately, we could not make seasonal adjust-
ments or adjust for residence latitude. However, a couple of studies
on variation of OC pesticides by region in the U.S. reported the
order of concentrations of p,p9-DDE by West.South.Mid-
west.Northeast, reflecting the history of the geographic manu-
facture and use of these chemicals [27,28]. Therefore, the failure
of adjusting for living area may lead to underestimation of the
association between OC pesticide and vitamin D levels as subjects
with high exposure to sunshine are likely to have high exposure to
OC pesticides. Finally, we could not exclude the possibility that
other POPs not measured in this study could play a role in the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, because serum concentrations of
POPs are highly correlated in the general population.
If the associations observed here were causal, as evidenced by
confirmation in prospective and experimental studies, avoiding
exposure to OC pesticides and any efforts to decrease body burden
of OC pesticides may be helpful to increase vitamin D levels and
decrease vitamin D deficiency-related diseases. There may be
Figure 1. Spline regression of serum concentration of p,p9-DDT on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels (ng/ml). The curve
was adjusted for gender, age, race, BMI, smoking status, outdoor activity, and vitamin D supplement. The distribution of p,p9-DDT among study
subjects was added below the X-axis. The increasing trend of vitamin D was mainly driven by only a very small number of subjects with very high
p,p9-DDT.

other chemicals which also disturb metabolism of vitamin D.
Therefore, there should be more human and experimental studies
on what kinds of chemicals can cause vitamin D deficiency and
what mechanisms would be involved.
