Prescribing Potentially Inappropriate Psychotropic
Medications to the Ambulatory Elderly
Jane R. Mort, PharmD; Rajender R. Aparasu, PhD
Background: Psychotropic agents account for 23% to
51% of all inappropriate medications prescribed based
on 1991 inappropriate medication criteria for nursing
home residents. The criteria were revised to apply to all
people older than 65 years. This study used the revised
criteria in ambulatory settings to quantify potentially
inappropriate prescription of psychotropic agents and
identify associated characteristics.
Methods: The 1996 public use data files of the Na-
tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the Na-
tional Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were ana-
lyzed for inappropriate prescription of psychotropic
medications for the elderly in office-based settings and
outpatient departments. Disease-independent and disease-
dependent criteria were analyzed.
Results: Elderly patients were prescribed a psycho-
tropic agent in 8.7% of all visits, antidepressant and an-
tianxiety agents being the most frequently prescribed
medications. Commonly, elderly patients receiving psy-
chotropic agents were female, white, aged between 65 and
74 years, and received health care in a metropolitan area.
Potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents were pre-
scribed in 27.2% of all visits involving a psychotropic agent
for the elderly. Disease-independent criteria (eg, anti-
depressant agents and long-acting benzodiazepines) ac-
counted for most of the potentially inappropriate pre-
scriptions. Factors positively associated with potentially
inappropriate prescriptions included older age, "seen be-
fore" status, and antidepressant drug class, while enroll-
ment in Medicaid, antipsychotic drug class, living in the
Northeast region, and receiving health care in a metro-
politan area were negatively associated.
Conclusions: Potentiallyinappropriateprescriptionofpsy-
chotropic agents is very common for the elderly patient
in the ambulatory setting. By focusing on the agents most
frequently involved (eg, amitriptyline and long-acting ben-
zodiazepines), provider characteristics (eg, location), and
patient characteristics (eg, age), the greatest impact on po-
tentially inappropriate prescribing can be achieved.

PSYCHOTROPIC AGENTS are fre-
quently prescribed to the el-
derly for a wide variety of
mental health conditions.1-3
These agents significantly
improve patients' conditions but also may
lead to deleterious outcomes, especially if
not used properly.2,3 Elderly patients are
more susceptible to these outcomes ow-
ing to pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-
namic changes.2,4 General concerns re-
garding medication use by elderly patients
led to the 1991 publication by Beers et al5
of potentially inappropriate medication cri-
teria for patients older than 65 years who
resided in long-term care facilities. Re-
searchers applying these criteria have
found that psychotropic agents consti-
tute a large portion of the potentially in-
appropriate prescriptions for the elderly
in various settings (23%, 44%, and 51%
in long-term care,office-basedsettings,and
outpatient departments, respectively).6-8
The applicability of these criteria to set-
tings outside of long-term care has been
questioned.
Beers,9 usingaconsensuspanelof6na-
tionally recognized experts, revised the cri-
teriain1997toapplytoallpeopleolderthan
65 years, to incorporate new information,
and to include a severity rating. This con-
sensus panel redefined medications that
should be generally avoided and identified
disease-dependent inappropriate medica-
tions. Given that psychotropic agents have
constituted a high proportion of poten-
tially inappropriate medications, and that
the revised criteria have not been exam-
ined in the ambulatory population, we un-
dertook this research. The specific objec-
tives of this study were (1) to examine the
nature and extent of potentially inappro-
priate prescription of psychotropic agents
for the elderly in physician offices and hos-
pital outpatient departments and (2) to de-
terminethefactorspredictingpotentiallyin-
appropriate prescription of psychotropic
agents in these settings.

RESULTS
According to the national surveys, psychotropic medi-
cations were prescribed in an estimated 16.55 million vis-
its to physician offices and outpatient departments for
the elderly in 1996. This represents 8.70% of all clinic
visits by the elderly, for an annual visit rate of 51.97 vis-
its for every 100 persons aged 65 years or older. The el-
derly receiving psychotropic agents were most often fe-
male (68.08%), white (87.74%), between ages 65 and 74
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is the pri-
mary source of ambulatory care data in the United States.
The agency annually conducts the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). These 2 na-
tional surveys provide the most comprehensive informa-
tion about the provision and use of ambulatory care ser-
vices in the United States.10 In this study, the 1996 public
use data files from the NAMCS and NHAMCS were used
to examine potentially inappropriate prescription of psy-
chotropic agents in physician offices and hospital outpa-
tient departments.11,12
The NAMCS provides comprehensive data on ambula-
tory care services rendered in office-based settings in the
United States. Findings are based on a sample representa-
tive of all in-person visits to office-based physicians. In 1996,
2142 office-based physicians participated in the multistage
probability sample survey for an overall response rate of 70%.
Data were collected using patient records forms (PRFs) by
participating physicians or their staff for a systematic ran-
dom sample of office visits during the randomly assigned re-
porting period. The PRF included patient demographic in-
formation, diagnoses (up to 3 diagnoses), drugs prescribed
(up to 6 medications), and disposition of the visit. The NCHS
also collected data on physician characteristics prior to the
survey implementation. A total of 29805 PRFs were col-
lected by participating physicians in 1996.
The NHAMCS collected data on ambulatory services
providedbyhospitaloutpatientdepartmentsandemergency
departmentsintheUnitedStates.Theoutpatientdepartment
component of NHAMCS involved a multistage probability
sample survey to collect data from a representative sample
of visits to hospital outpatient departments. In 1996, a na-
tionalsample of486 hospitals participated for anoverallre-
sponserateof95%.Datadescribingtheclinicalnatureofthe
visits were collected using PRFs similar to the one used in
theNAMCS.Atotalof235outpatientdepartmentsprovided
29806 PRFs. The NCHS also collected data regarding the
provider and institution characteristics. The outpatient de-
partmentcomponentoftheNHAMCSwasusedforthisstudy.
The data collection for the survey was done by the US
Bureau of the Census Housing Survey Branch, and data pro-
cessing and coding were performed by Analytic Services
Inc of Durham, NC. Diagnoses were coded according to
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification.13 A predefined checklist was also in-
cluded in the PRF in both national surveys to record other
existing conditions. Prescribed medications were coded ac-
cording to a unique classification scheme developed at the
NCHS.14 Respondents were instructed to record all new or
continued medications ordered, supplied, or adminis-
tered at the visit. Additional details regarding the meth-
ods, definitions, and technical information of the NAMCS
and NHAMCS can be found in other sources.11,12,15,16
DATA ANALYSIS
The data extraction and analysis involved use of SAS soft-
ware (version 6.03, 1992; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and
the Statistical Export and Tabulation System (version 1.22a,
1991; SETS) (National Center for Health Statistics, US Dept
ofHealthandHumanServices).Forthepurposeofthisstudy,
psychotropic drugs were categorized into 6 classes: antipsy-
chotic agents, stimulants, sedative/hypnotic agents, antianxi-
ety agents, and antidepressants. A detailed list of medica-
tionsundereachpsychotropicclass17-19 isprovidedinTable 1.
The psychotropic agent classification was based on standard
references and published literature. The explicit criteria de-
veloped by Beers9 were used to define potentially inappro-
priatepsychotropicusebytheelderly.Thepsychotropicdrugs
considered potentially inappropriate for this study entailed
medications that should be generally avoided in the elderly
(disease-independent inappropriate medications) and medi-
cationsthatshouldbeavoidedbecauseofpreexistingdisease
orcondition(disease-dependentinappropriatemedications).
Thedisease-independentanddisease-dependentinappropri-
atemedications9,13,17,18,20-27 arelistedinTable 2 andTable 3.
Psychotropic drugs considered potentially inappropriate
based on dose were not examined because of limitations of
the data sources.
Data extraction, coding, and analysis involved 3 steps.
First, visits involving psychotropic drugs for patients aged
65 years or older were abstracted. Second, single-entity and
combination drugs, along with the diagnoses, were exam-
ined for the potentially inappropriate psychotropic medi-
cations. Third, certain variables including patient, visit, and
provider characteristics were recoded for analytical pur-
poses. Extracted data sets from the NAMCS and NHAMCS
were combined to analyze potentially inappropriate psy-
chotropic agent prescribing in ambulatory settings. From
the 2 national surveys, 1373 records involving psycho-
tropic agents were extracted in the first step and 309 rec-
ords involving potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents
were extracted in the second step.
National visit estimates were derived based on the pa-
tient sampling weight provided by the NCHS to examine
the nature and extent of potentially inappropriate psycho-
tropic prescribing in ambulatory care settings (N=309). All
the visit estimates, visit rates, and percentage distribu-
tions were calculated based on the information provided
by the NCHS for the national surveys.11,12 To examine pre-
dictors of potentially inappropriate psychotropic prescrip-
tion, multiple logistic regression methods were applied to
modified weights to account for the complex design of the
national surveys (N=1373).28 The predictor variables in the
model were patient characteristics (ie, age, sex, race, in-
surance status, and payment method), visit (ie, referral, "seen
before" status, injury, and surgery), medication (ie, num-
ber of medications, number of psychotropic agents, and psy-
chotropic class), and provider characteristics (ie, nonphy-
sician, ambulatory setting, region of the country, and
metropolitan location of health care). Statistical signifi-
cance was defined as P.05 for all statistical analyses.

years (53.43%), and obtained care in metropolitan areas
(72.17%). The psychotropic prescribing patterns for the
elderly in ambulatory settings are given in Table 4.
VISITS INVOLVING
POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE
PSYCHOTROPIC AGENTS
Approximately 4.5 million visits (27.2% of all visits in-
volving psychotropic agents prescribed for the elderly)
involved at least 1 potentially inappropriate psycho-
tropic agent. The percentages of visits involving pre-
scription of potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents
in office practice and outpatient departments were 27.95%
and 19.28%, respectively. Disease-independent poten-
tially inappropriate agents accounted for 94.14%, and dis-
ease-dependent potentially inappropriate agents ac-
counted for 12.13% of all visits involving potentially
inappropriate psychotropic agents (Table 5). A visit was
counted more than once if multiple criteria were met. An-
tidepressant agents and antianxiety agents constituted
most of the potentially inappropriate prescribing in dis-
ease-independent situations, whereas antidepressant
agents and sedative/hypnotic drugs made up most of the
potentially inappropriate prescription in disease-
dependent situations. Overall, potentially inappropri-
ate psychotropic prescribing most often involved anti-
depressant agents and antianxiety agents, and the least
likely involved drugs were antipsychotic agents. Beers'
criteria9 also included a severity rating scale that incor-
porated the probability of the adverse outcome occur-
ring and the clinical significance of the problem (Table
2 and Table 3). According to this severity rating scale,
95.34% of the visits involving potentially inappropriate
psychotropic medications cause a high-severity type of
adverse outcome.
FACTORS PREDICTING POTENTIALLY
INAPPROPRIATE PSYCHOTROPIC
AGENT PRESCRIPTION
The logistic model was used to evaluate the factors pre-
dicting potentially inappropriate psychotropic agent pre-
scribing in ambulatory settings. The factors in Table 6
that provide the predictive power for the visits involv-
ing potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents in-
clude patient characteristics of age and insurance, visit
characteristic of "seen before" status, drug characteris-
tic of drug class, and provider characteristics of region

patients receiving psychotropic medications (ie,
12.2%-30%).3,29-32 This might be due to differences in
method issues such as definition of psychotropic agents,
data collection (eg, number of medications limited to 6
in this study), unit of observation, duration of data col-
lection, and regional characteristics. Studies reporting sex
and race information among elderly patients in the com-
munity receiving psychotropic agents concurred with our
study's findings of greater prevalence among wom-
en29,31,33,34 and whites.29 While our study found that an-
tidepressant drugs were the most commonly prescribed
psychotropic agents, followed by antianxiety agents and
sedative/hypnotic drugs, previous research on commu-
nity-dwelling elderly patients found that antianxiety medi-
cations were most often prescribed, followed by antide-
pressant and sedative/hypnotic drugs.3,29,35 The more
frequent prescription of antidepressant agents found in
our study may be owing to the increased emphasis on
recognizing and treating depression among the elderly19
since the early 1980s, when data were collected for the
comparative studies.3,29,35 Of the visits involving prescrip-
tion ofpsychotropicagents,18.3%included2ormoresuch
agents, which is similar to the findings of Dealberto et al,29
who found that 14.5% of their community-based elderly
patients prescribed psychotropic agents were receiving
2 to 4 of these drugs. Overall, the demographic charac-
teristics of the patients in our study are similar to those
in studies involving community-based elderly pa-
tients.29,31,33,34 However, in our study, the most frequently
prescribed psychotropic medication class differed,3,29,35 and
the percentage of visits involving psychotropic agents was
lower than the previously reported percentages of elderly
patients receiving psychotropic agents.3,29-32
More than 25% of visits involving psychotropic
agents were for one of the potentially inappropriate psy-
chotropic agents, which is greater than the percentage
reported using the 1991 criteria of Beers et al5 in an
office-based setting (16.9%).36 This may be due in part
to the different definitions of psychotropic agents used
or to the inclusion of outpatient departments in our
current study. However, a larger effect would have been
expected from the expanded 1997 criteria, which
included both disease-dependent criteria and more
disease-independent criteria.
Most potentially inappropriate psychotropic medi-
cation visits are accounted for by the disease-
independent criteria. Since the disease-dependent crite-
ria are much more restrictive, this category would be
expected to constitute a smaller percentage of visits. The
small percentage may also be because of the limited
number of diagnoses (ie, up to 3) that were available in
the data source. This research suggests that disease-
independent criteria are an important aspect to con-
sider when attempting to have the greatest impact on the
prescription of potentially inappropriate psychotropic
agents.
Antidepressant and antianxiety classes were the most
commonly involved potentially inappropriate psycho-
tropic medications prescribed in this study as well as in
the community-based study using the 1991 criteria.36 Ac-
cording to Beers' 1997 list,9 these 2 classes made up 5 of
the 7 disease-independent criteria and 5 of the 8 disease-
dependent criteria. Therefore, it would be anticipated that
they would account for most of the potentially inappro-
priate prescribing. More specifically, most potentially in-
appropriate psychotropic agent visits involved amitrip-
tyline, an antidepressant agent that can cause substantial
anticholinergic effects and sedation.9 The antianxiety
agents considered potentially inappropriate were pri-
marily composed of the long-acting benzodiazepines,
which are associated with sedation, falls, and fractures.9
Therefore, by focusing on amitriptyline and long-acting
benzodiazepines, physicians can significantly change
inappropriate prescribing for and quality of life of the
elderly.
The importance of these 2 classes of medications
in potentially inappropriate prescription was further
validated by a large consensus panel in Canada.37 The cri-
teria produced by this panel also included the avoid-
ance of amitriptyline to treat depression and of long-
acting benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or
agitation in dementia. While the Canadian criteria are
more disease specific, the indications associated with the

long-acting benzodiazepines are comprehensive and
would be expected to include most of the uses.
Disease-dependent and disease-independent psy-
chotropic medications are considered inappropriate be-
cause the risk outweighs the benefit.9 Most of the inap-
propriate psychotropic agents cause a high-severity type
of adverse outcome according to Beers' criteria.9 Previ-
ous research has shown that inadequate or inappropri-
ate drug therapy is an important risk factor for medication-
related illnesses among the elderly.38 Therefore, avoiding
these medications will significantly reduce the risk of ad-
verse outcomes.
Characteristics associated with a greater likelihood
of a visit involving a potentially inappropriate psycho-
tropic agent were patient's older age, seen before status,
and antidepressant class. The odds of prescribing a po-
tentially inappropriate psychotropic medication in-
creased by 2% for each additional year of patient age or
10% for every 5-year increment of an elderly patient's age.
Previous studies examining all criteria for inappropriate
prescription have reported higher rates in patients older
than 80 years.7,39 The positive association of seen before
patients suggests that previously seen patients are more
than twice as likely to receive potentially inappropriate
psychotropic medications than new patients. Consis-
tent with a previous study, our study found the highest
odds of potentially inappropriate psychotropic prescrip-
tion were for antidepressant agents.36 Amitriptyline con-
stituted most of these potentially inappropriate prescrip-
tion cases, and its use is rarely justified for the elderly
because safer antidepressant agents are available.9 Be-
cause of the consistent findings, efforts focusing on these
patient and drug characteristics could provide the great-
est impact on inappropriate psychotropic medication
prescribing.
Characteristics associated with a decreased likeli-
hood of a visit involving prescription of a potentially in-
appropriate psychotropic agent included antipsychotic
drug class, Medicaid status, metropolitan area, and North-
east region location. The antipsychotic class was least
likely to be associated with potentially inappropriate pre-
scription. This may be owing to increased awareness
among prescribers or limited use of antipsychotic agents
in patientswith seizure disorders. The relationshipofMed-
icaid status to decreased usage of potentially inappro-
priate medications may be partially explained by pre-
scription benefit plans. Medicaid programs involve some
systemwide control mechanisms such as prospective and
retrospective drug utilization reviews to improve physi-
cian prescribing practices.40 Consistent with a previous
study,8 our study found that physicians practicing in met-
ropolitan areas were less likely to prescribe inappropri-
ately, yet no clear explanation exists for this difference.
Another geographic factor negatively associated with po-
tentially inappropriate psychotropic prescription was the
Northeast region. However, prescribing patterns in other
regions might raise some concerns. Therefore, the re-
gion and location characteristics associated with lower
odds of potentially inappropriate psychotropic use re-
quire further examination to understand the relation-
ship before the most effective strategy for modifying pre-
scribing patterns can be deployed.
Although our study provided greater insight into po-
tentially inappropriate psychotropic prescribing pat-
terns for the elderly in outpatient settings, the results were
limited by the definitions and data sources used. Be-
cause of the limitations of the data sources, our study did
not examine psychotropic agents considered poten-
tially inappropriate based on excessive dosage. There-
fore, this probably underestimated the extent of inap-
propriately prescribed psychotropic medications in the
elderly. In addition, data collection limitations such as a
maximum of 6 medications and 3 diagnoses may have
yielded an underreporting of the total number of poten-
tially inappropriate medications prescribed. The inde-
pendent variables included in the logistic analysis were
limited to those available from the data sources. Further-
more, the analyses explored associations between the
independent variables and potentially inappropriate
prescription, and did not address cause-and-effect rela-
tionships between them. In this study, the overall an-
nual visit estimates are considered stable by the NCHS.
However, extrapolation of national visits from the sub-
samples could create potential problems regarding the
reliability and confidence level of smaller estimates.15,16
The inherent disadvantages of using secondary data, such
as difficulty in evaluating accuracy caused by errors in
data collection, analysis, and reporting, were also limi-
tations of this study.
In summary, potentially inappropriate prescrip-
tion is a major issue in the effort to optimize care for the
elderly while avoiding excessive costs associated with ad-
verse outcomes. Future research should quantify the
health care impact of prescribing these potentially inap-
propriate agents. Currently, inappropriate prescription
of psychotropic agents is very common for the elderly
in the ambulatory setting, with 27.2% of all psycho-
tropic agent­related visits involving a potentially in-
appropriate psychotropic agent. A small number of
psychotropic medications (ie, amitriptyline and long-
acting benzodiazepines) were involved in most of the
visits involving potentially inappropriate psychotropic
agents. By focusing on these agents and some of the pro-
vider characteristics (eg, location) and patient features
(eg, patient age), the greatest impact on potentially in-
appropriate prescribing can be achieved.
