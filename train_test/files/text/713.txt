Sensitization to natural rubber latex is a prerequisite to type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria,
angioedema, anaphylaxis, and allergic rhinitis) that result from subsequent latex exposure. This study examines
occupations in which latex glove use is common to determine whether it is associated with increased prevalence
odds of latex sensitization (measured by latex-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies) by using data from 5,512
adults aged 17­60 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1991). After
other factors associated with latex sensitization were controlled for, there was a nonsignificant association
between longest-held jobs in health care and latex sensitization (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95 percent confidence
interval (CI): 0.92, 2.40). For current occupations, latex sensitization was not associated with health care work
in which gloves were used (OR = 1.17, 95 percent CI: 0.51, 2.65) or with other occupations in which latex glove
use is common (OR = 1.01, 95 percent CI: 0.49, 2.07) compared with other occupations. Current health care
workers who reported not using gloves were at increased risk of latex sensitization, both among those without
a history of childhood atopy (OR = 2.30, 95 percent CI: 1.04, 5.13) and those with such a history (OR = 28.04,
95 percent CI: 3.64, 215.97). This odds ratio heterogeneity suggests that subjects with childhood atopy may be
at high risk of latex sensitization. Am J Epidemiol 2001;153:515­22.

Allergic reactions to natural rubber latex are a concern in
the health care industry. Among health care workers, the
prevalence of latex sensitization has been estimated at 3­22
percent (1­12), depending on the population studied, the
definition of sensitization used, and the selection criteria for
inclusion of subjects in the study. Among the general popu-
lation, the prevalence has been estimated at 6­12 percent
(13­16). However, in spite of the numerous studies that
have examined either the seroprevalence of latex-specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies or skin prick reactivity
to extracts from latex gloves, direct comparisons between
health care workers and comparable general populations
have not been made. Thus, it is not established that the
prevalence of latex sensitization is higher in health care
workers than in the general population. It is desirable that
the prevalence of latex sensitization be measured accurately
in exposed and comparable referent groups in to identify the
latex products and circumstances of use that are associated
with sensitization.
Latex sensitization refers to the presence of latex-specific
IgE antibody. It is postulated that both dermal contact and
inhalation of airborne glove powder in health care settings
may sensitize nonallergic individuals (17­19), which has led
to recommendations for changes in glove use (20). Among
sensitized individuals, reexposure to latex antigens may
result in IgE-mediated clinical allergies (21, 22), which
include anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and
allergic rhinitis (23).
Our investigation examined the data collected by the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) regarding the seroprevalence of latex-

specific IgE antibodies in the US general population. The
purpose of this study was to examine whether work in health
care jobs is associated with increased risk of latex sensitiza-
tion and to determine whether other factors (such as glove
use, atopy, age, sex, and race) affect this association.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, phase I, which was con-
ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics between
October 1988 and October 1991 (24, 25). The data were
obtained on a public-use CD-ROM provided by the National
Center for Health Statistics (26). The NHANES III data,
when used with sampling weights to correct for different
sampling probabilities, noncoverage, and nonresponse, pro-
vide estimates of the health status of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population of the United States aged 2 months
and older (24). A 15 percent random sample of participants
aged 17­60 years was tested by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) for latex-specific IgE anti-
bodies. Subjects were chosen for laboratory analyses with-
out knowledge of their occupation, symptoms, latex sensiti-
zation status, or other factors associated with latex
sensitization.
Questionnaire data regarding health conditions, allergies,
and demographic factors were obtained from the same indi-
viduals. The variables we considered as potential explana-
tory factors were occupation (current occupation, ever wear
protective equipment, ever wear protective gloves, how long
worked at job, longest-held occupation), demographics (sex,
race, ethnicity, age, urban/rural residence), family history of
allergic conditions (parental asthma or hay fever), smoking
(ever smoked cigarettes, smoke cigarettes now, anyone in
the home smoke cigarettes, quit smoking because of health
problems), allergic conditions (ever asthma, ever bronchitis,
ever hay fever, age at diagnosis of asthma, age at diagnosis
of bronchitis, age at diagnosis of hay fever, current asthma,
current bronchitis, current hay fever), respiratory and aller-
gic conditions (wheezing or whistling in the chest; stuffy
nose; watery, itchy eyes; symptoms brought on by exercise;
symptoms brought on by animals; symptoms brought on by
work environment; symptoms brought on by pollen), and
frequency of visiting a dentist.
The CDC used the AlaSTAT test (Diagnostics Products
Corporation, Los Angeles, California) to test for latex sensi-
tivity (27). In the AlaSTAT test, 50 µl of serum is mixed with
100 µl of latex allergen reagent. After an hour of incubation,
an antiligand reagent is added to capture latex-specific IgE
bound to the latex reagent. After washing, an enzyme-
anti-IgE reagent is added to react with IgE that has bound the
latex allergen. After another wash, substrate is added, and
color development is stopped after precisely 15 minutes by
the addition of sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 492 nm of
each latex allergen test is compared with a reference curve,
and values of latex-specific IgE are interpolated. For the
purposes of these analyses, values below 0.35 IU/ml were
classified as negative, values from 0.35 to 1.50 IU/ml were
classified as positive, and those at and above 1.50 IU/ml
were classified as strongly positive. These cutpoints and
ranges are commonly regarded as differentiating between
negative, positive, and strongly positive, latex-specific IgE
antibody concentrations (15, 16).
NHANES III contained information on the current occu-
pation, including questions about whether gloves were ever
worn in the subject's current job. Subjects were grouped by
occupation according to the following definitions:
· Health care workers were defined as subjects who
reported their current occupation as one of the health
diagnosing, assessment, and treatment occupations or
as one of the health service occupations. A total of 109
health care workers reported using gloves, and 65
reported that they did not use gloves at work.
· Other jobs with glove use were defined as those
involving subjects who worked in occupations other
than health care in which latex glove use is common
and who reported using gloves at work. These were
food handlers and cooks (28, 29), private household
workers (29), protective service workers (law enforce-
ment, ambulance attendants, and firefighters) (29),
cleaning occupations, and nursery farmers (30).
· Nonhealth-care workers, nonglove users were defined
as subjects who reported any other current occupation.
NHANES III also contained information about the
longest-held occupation of each subject. This information
was of interest in this study because of the possibility that
latex-sensitized subjects might have left exposed jobs pref-
erentially compared with nonsensitized subjects. If this were
true, the longest-held occupation might be less subject to
any differential selection bias out of health care occupations.
Subjects were grouped according to the longest-held occu-
pation using the definitions above, except that information
on glove use was not collected in the NHANES III survey.
Because the NHANES III data were derived from a strati-
fied sample of the US population, the weight assigned to each
subject was also used in the analyses. Of the 5,524 subjects
tested for IgE, 12 subjects were excluded because they had
been examined in their homes rather than in mobile examina-
tion centers, leaving 5,512 subjects available for the analyses.
Information on glove use was missing for three subjects, leav-
ing 5,509 in the analyses by current occupation. Information
on longest-held occupation was missing for 290 subjects,
leaving 5,222 subject in the analyses by longest occupation.
To assess the possibility of selection bias, we examined
whether the study results were influenced by different serum
selection probabilities with respect to work in health care,
other factors associated with latex sensitization, and demo-
graphic factors (age, sex, ethnicity). The prevalence of latex
sensitization was compared between occupation groups by
using a contingency table. Prevalence odds ratios and 95
percent confidence intervals were calculated by using
weighted ordinal logistic regression in which the outcome
variable was latex sensitization classified as a three-level
variable: negative (<0.35 IU/ml), positive (0.35 to <1.50
IU/ml), and strongly positive (1.50 IU/ml). Demographic
variables, allergic conditions, history of atopy, and other
factors were added sequentially to identify the best model
(judged by the ­2 log-likelihood ratio test). Effect modifica-

tion was examined by the addition of interaction terms, and
when odds ratio heterogeneity was detected, the strata were
kept separate in further analyses.
Assessing the role of atopy was an important issue, inso-
far as atopic conditions (e.g., asthma and hay fever) are both
recognized risk factors for latex sensitization and may also
be consequences of latex sensitization. To differentiate
whether atopy was antecedent to health care work or may
have been a consequence of health care work, we examined
the association between latex sensitization and health care
work separately for subjects who reported childhood asthma
and hay fever (onset before age 18 years) and those who did
not and for those who reported the onset of asthma or hay
fever prior to starting their current job and those who did not.
A final model, which included occupation group, age,
sex, race, and physician-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, was
chosen to represent the association between each measure of
latex sensitization and each occupation group. This model
was compared with a reduced model, which excluded physi-
cian-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, to examine whether a
history of atopy altered the associations between latex sen-
sitization and occupation. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina) (31) and SUDAAN version 6.04 (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina)
(32), which allows estimation of complex sample variances
in the presence of stratified and clustered survey data (33).
RESULTS
There were no appreciable differences (and no statisti-
cally significant differences) between subjects whose latex-
specific IgE was measured and those who were excluded
from the IgE analysis, in terms of sex, race/ethnicity, age,
the proportion who worked in health care, the proportion
with physician-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, or the pro-
portion of smokers. Thus, there was no evidence of selection
bias in the testing of subjects for latex-specific IgE.
The best model for each combination of latex sensitization
and occupation group contained the same set of explanatory
variables (age, race, sex, and physician-diagnosed asthma or
hay fever), and the regression coefficients for these variables
were relatively stable across these models. For example (table
1), the model indicates that after controlling for all other fac-
tors, subjects who reported that their longest job was in health
care were at 1.49 times higher odds of latex sensitization
(both a positive and strongly positive IgE response vs. a neg-
ative response) than were nonhealth-care workers (95 percent
confidence interval (CI): 0.92, 2.40). Females were at signif-
icantly lower odds than were males (odds ratio (OR) = 0.58,
95 percent CI: 0.45, 0.75), Black non-Hispanics (OR = 1.41,
95 percent CI: 1.10, 1.80) were at significantly increased odds
compared with White non-Hispanics, and older ages were at
significantly reduced odds (for subjects aged 50­60 years
compared with those aged 19 and under (OR = 0.61, 95 per-
cent CI: 0.43, 0.86)). Subjects with physician-diagnosed
asthma or hay fever were at significantly increased odds
(OR = 2.53, 95 percent CI: 2.12, 3.02) compared with those
without these conditions.
Table 2 presents the results for the occupations in two dif-
ferent models: a model containing occupation group and
demographic variables (sex, race, age) and a final model
containing the same set of predictor variables with atopy
(asthma or hay fever) added. Comparison of these models
allows an assessment of whether there is any appreciable
confounding by atopy after controlling for sex, race, and
age. The final model indicates that there was a weak associ-
ation between latex sensitization and the longest-held job in
health care (OR = 1.49, 95 percent CI: 0.92, 2.40) and no
association between latex sensitization and work in other
jobs in which glove use is common (OR = 1.07, 95 percent
CI: 0.75, 1.53). In each instance, comparison of the full
model and the reduced model indicated that adjustment for
atopy did not appreciably alter any of the associations
between occupations and latex sensitization.
For current occupations (table 2), there was no associa-
tion between latex sensitization and health care work with
glove use (OR = 1.17, 95 percent CI: 0.51, 2.65). Among
health care workers who denied using gloves, there was a
moderate association with latex sensitization (OR = 2.53, 95
percent CI: 1.21, 5.29). However, there was odds ratio het-
erogeneity when these results were stratified on childhood
atopy (for those with childhood atopy, OR = 28.04, 95 per-
cent CI: 3.64, 215.97; for those without childhood atopy,

OR = 2.30, 95 percent CI: 1.04, 5.13). This interaction sug-
gests that health care workers who denied glove use and
who have a history of childhood atopy may be at substan-
tially higher risk of latex sensitization than those without
such a history. There was no clear evidence of odds ratio
heterogeneity for any of the other current or longest-held job
groups. Other current jobs in which latex glove use is com-
mon were not associated with latex sensitization (OR =
1.01, 95 percent CI: 0.49, 2.07).
It is possible that the lack of association between current
health care work with gloves and latex sensitization is due
in part to movement of sensitized workers out of jobs in
which they would be exposed to gloves. To evaluate this
possibility, we analyzed information on whether subjects
had ever changed jobs because of health problems. Current
health care workers who did not use gloves were not appre-
ciably different from nonhealth-care workers with respect to
such job changes (12.1 vs. 11.8 percent, respectively, p =
0.96). These findings suggest that subjects had not moved to
health care jobs in which gloves were not used because of
allergies or other health problems.
The prevalence of latex sensitization was calculated for
each of 39 different longest-held occupational groups (figure
1). Figure 1 shows that health care workers were not unusual
with respect to other occupations when ranked by the preva-
lence of sensitization at 0.35 to less than 1.50 IU/ml, when
ranked by the prevalence of sensitization at 1.50 IU/ml or
more, or when both categories were summed. Other occupa-
tions in which latex gloves are used frequently, such as mis-
cellaneous food workers, cooks, private household workers,
protective service workers (law enforcement, ambulance
attendants, and firefighters), cleaning occupations, and nurs-
ery farmers, tended to be in the upper half of the distribution
but were not at clearly higher risk than other occupations.
DISCUSSION
The results in table 2 suggest that there may be an associ-
ation between long-term work in health care and latex sen-
sitization. Insofar as the information about the longest-held
jobs does not contain information about glove use, it cannot
be determined whether these associations are explained by
glove use or by other factors. However, the findings for cur-
rent jobs suggest that glove use may not be associated with
increased risk of sensitization either among health care
workers or in other jobs in which latex glove use is com-
mon. They also indicate that work in health care jobs in
which gloves are not used is moderately associated with
latex sensitization. The associations between occupations
and latex sensitization were not appreciably altered by
adjustments for asthma and hay fever. This suggests that
these conditions were not consequences of sensitization, but
rather were predictors of sensitization that are independent
of occupation (and latex exposure). However, a history of
childhood atopy was a strong effect modifier in current
health care workers who denied glove use. Although this
observation suggests that people with childhood atopy may
be at high risk of latex sensitization, the data in our study are
too small to draw any firm conclusions on this point. This
effect was not seen in the other current or longest-held job
groups.
In the aggregate, these results provide little support for
the conclusion that glove use is associated with latex sensi-
tization either in health care workers or in other jobs in

which latex glove use is common, and they provide weak
support for the conclusion that long-term work in health
care is associated with sensitization.
It is possible that sensitized subjects selectively leave jobs
within health care in which they are exposed to latex gloves,
leading to differential exposure misclassification. However,
since the majority of subjects who are sensitized to latex are
asymptomatic and are unaware of their antibody status (34),
such persons would have little reason to change jobs more
frequently than those who are not sensitized. In addition,
workers who develop clinical allergies to latex gloves typi-
cally switch to nonlatex gloves rather than changing jobs,
for which there would be an attendant loss of seniority and
job skills. In support of this view, we found no evidence that
health care workers who used gloves or those who did not
changed jobs because of health problems more frequently
than did nonhealth-care workers. It is possible, however,
that subjects who are sensitized and who continue to suffer
from latex-related allergies in spite of attempts to reduce
their exposure would preferentially move to nonexposed
jobs.
Our findings are consistent with other published studies.
Atopy is a strong and consistent risk factor for latex sensiti-
zation (1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 21, 35­37). Non-White race has
been observed to be a risk factor for latex sensitization in a
large study of nurses (5), among surgery patients (13), and
among blood donors in the general population (15). Male
sex is also a recognized risk factor in some (13, 15), but not
all (14), studies. Consistent with our findings, previous stud-
ies of health care workers have not demonstrated any con-
sistent pattern of dose response between sensitization and
increasing exposure to latex in gloves. Numerous studies
have sought, but failed to find, associations between the risk
of latex sensitization and the following exposure metrics
1) the duration of exposure to latex gloves or the duration of
work in health care (2, 12, 38); 2) the duration of latex glove
use (2); 3) the frequency of glove use (9); 4) the number of
hours worked in health care jobs (2); and 5) work in operat-
ing rooms and settings with frequent glove use versus work
in areas with infrequent glove use (5). One study found an
association between the prevalence of latex sensitivity and
the number of surgical gloves used, but did not find any
such association with the number of examination gloves
used (4). Examination gloves commonly contain higher lev-
els of protein allergens and generate higher exposures to
aeroallergens (23). In contrast, another study found no dif-
ference in skin prick test conversion rates between users of
powdered (high-protein) gloves and users of powder-free
(low-protein) gloves followed prospectively for a year (21).
Yet another study showed no relation between powdered
glove use and latex-specific IgE antibodies (3). Other stud-
ies have failed to find evidence that latex glove use is asso-
ciated with latex sensitization. In a prospective study of
latex glove users, the incidence of latex sensitization (deter-
mined by skin prick test) was 1 percent per year among
users of high-protein, powdered latex gloves and was 1 per-
cent per year among users of low-protein, powder-free latex
gloves (21). Similar findings were obtained in a recent
cross-sectional study in which neither current nor past use of
latex gloves was associated with latex sensitization in hos-
pital-based health care workers (34).
Postulated explanations for this lack of evidence of dose
response include selection of sensitized workers out of
latex-exposed jobs and avoidance of latex gloves by sub-
jects after they have become sensitized. While both of these
tendencies may exist, the absence of evidence of dose
response remains an important argument against a conclu-
sion that latex glove use is a cause of allergic sensitization.
Other occupations in which there is an appreciable risk of
IgE-mediated allergic sensitization (such as in workers
exposed to laboratory animals, platinum salts, and grain
dust) show unequivocal evidence of increasing risk with
increasing duration, intensity, and frequency of exposure
(39­47). Removal of sensitized workers and avoidance of
exposure in these settings does not obscure the evidence that
workers with heavier, longer, and more frequent exposure
are at higher risk of sensitization (48).
Latex sensitization among patients is believed to be a
result of intimate contact with latex-containing products
during medical procedures, such as among patients with
myelodysplasia (49), spina bifida (37, 50), meningomyelo-
cele (51), congenital genitourinary anomalies (36), and mul-
tiple surgeries (52), whereas the studies of latex glove use
suggest that the relative risk of sensitization is low when
there is only skin contact. Our findings are consistent with
this interpretation. It is possible that immediate hypersensi-
tivity reactions that are diagnosed after latex exposure in
health care workers may reflect increased clinical surveil-
lance rather than increased rates of sensitization.
The limitations of the NHANES III data include a lack of
information about the specific job duties, specific types of
gloves used, or subjects' handling of or exposure to other
latex devices at work. As a result, the explanation for the
association we observed between latex sensitization and
current jobs in health care in which gloves were not used
remains unclear and should be the subject of additional
study. A further limitation of the NHANES III data is the
lack of information on glove use in the longest-held occu-
pations, which precluded any analyses of whether the risk of
sensitization in longest-held jobs in health care work was
related to glove use. It is possible that other sources of expo-
sure to latex rubber in the general environment may be
important determinants of sensitization. For example, expo-
sure to latex antigens is common at low levels from sources
such as vehicle tire dust and dusts deposited around free-
ways (53). It is possible that persons who held some specific
occupations in our referent category (such as vehicle
mechanics who repair tires, professional drivers, and rubber
workers) were exposed to latex and that this may have
increased the prevalence of sensitization in our referent
group. However, it is likely that such an effect would be
small because such persons made up a small proportion of
the referent group. Moreover, this would not explain why
health care workers who did not use gloves would be at sub-
stantially increased odds, while those who used gloves
would not.
The estimates of latex antibody seroprevalence in this
study are somewhat higher than those in other studies that
Latex Sensitization 521

have also used the AlaSTAT method (5, 13, 15, 16). The rea-
sons for this are not clear. The laboratory personnel who
conducted the AlaSTAT assays at the CDC were blinded to
the subjects' identities (27), making differential observation
bias unlikely. Any systematic error in the AlaSTAT assays
would likely have affected all of the NHANES III subjects
and would be unlikely to account for the findings in any par-
ticular occupational group. Moreover, the pattern of associ-
ations with age, sex, and race found in this study agrees
closely with findings from other studies that used the same
methods, indicating that there was not random error ade-
quate to obscure these associations.
