HEALTH, in the National Social Life, Health, and Ag-
ing Project (NSHAP), was defined broadly to include
not only biological but also social, psychological, and envi-
ronmental domains. The design of this study was carefully
planned to allow for investigation of the interaction between
domains and the impact of these interactions on health and
health outcomes. A great strength of NSHAP is its compre-
hensive collection of both social measures and biological
measures. Because of these detailed measures, NSHAP is
able to capture many important social, psychological, and
physiological dimensions of aging.
This paper elaborates on the physiological and physical
health measures reported by NSHAP, focusing particularly
on the measures of chronic conditions and diseases seen
most commonly in aging populations in the United States.
In NSHAP, there are two types of health measures: self-
reported and direct biological measures (biomeasures).
For self-reported measures, respondents were asked to
rate aspects of their health and report on their health con-
ditions and physical functioning. For the biomeasures, ei-
ther physical measurements of respondents' health status
and physiological functioning were recorded or biologi-
cal samples were collected for analysis of measures asso-
ciated with physiological function. In some cases, the
self-reported measures and direct biomeasures act as com-
plements, assessing different dimensions of the same con-
dition; in other cases, the two types of measures serve to
cross-validate each other. The combination of self-reported
measures and biomeasures thus gives us a more compre-
hensive picture of respondents' health than is typically
available.
An additional objective of this article is to promote re-
search using NSHAP by providing pertinent background
information on these measures and their associated condi-
tions. The biological and behavioral measures collected in
NSHAP in combination with the breadth and depth of de-
mographic and social data allow for many opportunities to
explore the potential biological mechanisms and relation-
ships that mediate the relationship between social factors
and health at older ages. Because of space constraints, this
discussion is not exhaustive, but we hope that the overviews
will provide an introduction to the various measures and
stimulate social science researchers to pursue analyses us-
ing these measures. To this latter end, we include references
for further reading.

Objectives. This paper presents a description of the methods used in the National Social Life, Health, andAging Project
to detect the presence of chronic conditions and diseases associated with aging. It also discusses the validity and distribu-
tion of these measures.
Methods. Markers associated with common chronic diseases and conditions of aging were collected from 3,005 com-
munity-dwelling older adults living in the United States, aged 57­85 years, during 2006. Dried blood spots, physical func-
tion tests, anthropometric measurements, self-reported history, and self-rated assessments were used to detect the presence
of chronic conditions associated with aging or of risk factors associated with the development of chronic diseases.
Results. The distribution of each measure, disaggregated by age group and gender, is presented.
Conclusions. This paper describes the methodology used as well as the distribution of each of these measures. In ad-
dition, we discuss how the measures used in the study relate to specific chronic diseases and conditions associated with
aging and how these measures might be used in social science analyses.

health and chronic condition measures. Due to time con-
straints, some sections of the NSHAP were modularized to
maximize the amount of information that could be obtained
from the maximum number of participants in the minimum
amount of time. For these sections, respondents were ran-
domized to receive different modules, each of which asked
respondents a different set of questions. Consequently, not all
measures are available for all respondents. For variables as-
sociated with chronic conditions and diseases, this design
resulted in only two thirds of respondents being asked to par-
ticipate in the "get up and go" test and four fifths of respon-
dents asked to provide blood spots. The resulting sample
sizes for these measures will be lower than the overall sample
size. An overview of the health-related measures collected in
NSHAP is provided in Table 1. This table also includes final
sample sizes for each of these measures.
Methods
The methods described here are those used in the in-home
collection of data for NSHAP. Because of the many chal-
lenges associated with in-home collection of biological
measures of health in a nationally representative sample of
older adults, some of these methods are not optimal and
may not be comparable to clinical standards. Every effort
was made to maximize the utility and comparability of each
measure. Each variable chosen for collection and each of
the methods used for collection were considered relative to
many limiting factors, including adaptability to collection
in the home, time required for collection, cost of collection,
ease of training and implementation by field interviewers,
and participant burden. Field interviewers were trained, in-
person, in the collection of each of these methods using a
combination of lecture, demonstration, and participation
and were provided with detailed, diagrammed protocols.
Biomeasure Collection
Blood pressure.--High blood pressure, also known as
hypertension, is a condition in which blood pressure is
persistently elevated beyond normal levels. A type of car-
diovascular disease, high blood pressure accounts for about
5% of all cardiovascular-related deaths (American Heart
Association, 2005) and is associated with increased risk
of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease
(Chobanian et al., 2003). The presence of hypertension is
strongly associated with aging (Hajjar & Kotchen, 2003).
Current guidelines published by the American Heart Asso-
ciation (http://www.americanheart.org) categorize normal
blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg
and a diastolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg. A systolic
pressure between 120 and 139 mmHg or a diastolic pressure
between 80 and 89 mmHg is considered to be prehyper-
tensive, and a systolic pressure greater than 140 mmHg
or a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg is diagnostic
of hypertension.
In NSHAP, two blood pressure readings were taken from
the left arm using a Lifesource digital blood pressure mon-
itor (Model: UA-767PVL) following the manufacturer's
usage recommendations. A third blood pressure reading
was taken if the first two systolic readings differed from
each other by 20 mmHg or more or if the first two diastolic
readings differed from each other by 14 mmHg or more. In
analyzing blood pressure data, hypertension medication
and other medications that affect blood pressure should be
taken into account. Pulse was also recorded from the blood
pressure monitor; the mean of the first two readings is typ-
ically used in analyses. Normal pulse rates are between
60 and 80 beats per minute. Table 2 reports the summary
statistics of the blood pressure and pulse readings for the
NSHAP sample.

NSHAP MEASURES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS i69
Anthropometric measures.--Anthropometric measures
refer to body measurements such as height, weight, and
waist circumference that are used to characterize the size
and shape of the body. In adults, anthropometric measure-
ments are used to assess obesity, a condition in which the
proportion of body fat exceeds the range thought to be nor-
mal or healthy. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of
chronic conditions at older ages such as cardiovascular dis-
ease and diabetes and with a higher risk of premature death
(National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of
Obesity, 2000).
There are two measures of obesity reported by NSHAP:
body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. An indi-
vidual's BMI is defined as his or her weight in kilograms
divided by the square of his or her height in meters, that is,
BMI = weight [kg]/(height [m])2. (Note that weight alone
is thought to be an insufficient indicator of obesity in the
absence of height.) High BMI has been shown to be associ-
ated with increased risk of mortality (Calle, Thun, Petrelli,
Rodriguez, & Heath, 1999). Waist measurements are useful
as a proxy for abdominal fat (Lemieux, Prud'homme,
Bouchard, Tremblay, & Despres, 1996), and high waist cir-
cumference has been associated with increased cardiovascu-
lar disease risk, especially among individuals with high BMI.
The distributions of waist circumference, height, weight, and
BMI in the NSHAP sample are shown in Table 3.
The World Health Organization (1995) has identified six
statistical categories associated with ranges of BMI; these
categories are typically used in analyses. The categories are
low (BMI <18.5), slightly low (BMI 18.5­20), normal (BMI
20­25), high (BMI 25­30), obese (BMI 30), and very
obese (BMI 40). For waist measures, the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (1998) has designated as high
risk having a waist circumference greater than 102 cm for
men and greater than 88 cm for women. BMI and waist
classifications may be used as separate measures of obesity
or combined as shown in Table 4.
Height was measured in the following way. With the re-
spondent against a wall, a clipboard was placed on top of
the respondent's head and a Post-it note was placed directly
below the clipboard. The respondent was asked to step away
from the wall, and a standard measuring tape was used to
measure the distance from the floor to the top of the Post-it
note.Weight was measured with clothing on, using a Health-
o-Meter digital scale (Model: HDL111DQ-60), and re-
corded to the nearest half pound. For waist measurements, a
standard fiberglass tape measure was used to measure the
waist at a point midway between the iliac crest and the bot-
tom rib, just above the navel.

Get up and go.--NSHAP reports a measure of physical
mobility. Loss of mobility has been shown to be a useful
predictor of future physical disability (Fried, Bandeen-
Roche, Chaves, & Johnson, 2000), and in older adults, phys-
ical disability is strongly associated with chronic conditions
(Wolff, Starfield, & Anderson, 2002): older individuals with
multiple chronic conditions are more likely to experience
rapid declines and disability, and conversely, disabled adults
are at greater risk of health complications and developing
other impairments (Stuck et al., 1999). Disability and im-
pairment are also strong predictors of subjective well-being
and, moreover, are better predictors of subjective ratings of
well-being than the pathology or disease precipitating the
disability (Ormel et al., 1997). Disabled adults also have in-
creased mortality risk (Lamarca et al., 2003).
In NSHAP, physical mobility is measured by the timed
get-up-and-go test. For this test, respondents are asked to,
from a seated position, get up from a chair, walk 3 (premea-
sured) m at a normal pace, turn around, walk back 3 m to-
ward the chair, and sit down again. The time (in seconds)
that it took for the respondent to (a) stand, (b) walk 3 m, (c)
turn around, (d) return 3 m, and (e) turn and sit was recorded
with the aid of a computer. Although the times of the indi-
vidual stages may be used, most analyses use, as a measure
of mobility, the overall time of completion of the get-up-
and-go test or a dichotomous variable based on that overall
time. Bischoff and colleagues (2003) suggest a reported time
of 12 s or less as indicative of normal mobility (Table 5).
Salivary hormones and dried blood spots.--Direct mea-
sures of key physiological measures were assayed from ei-
ther saliva or dried blood spot samples. An in-depth
discussion of the analytes, methods of collection, and anal-
ysis of salivary hormones can be found in Gavrilova and
colleagues (this issue). A list of the measures assayed from
saliva and dried blood spots can be found in Table 1. An in-
depth discussion of the analytes, methods of collection, and
analysis of dried blood spots can be found in Williams and
McDade (this issue).
Self-rated and Self-reported Measures
Functional health.--Functional health is the ability to en-
gage in everyday activities such as bathing or walking. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Control (2004), many
older adults report physical limitations with respect to walk-
ing, reaching, stooping, and pushing. As discussed in the
mobility section, physical disability is strongly predictive of
trajectories of physical health and mortality.
NSHAP reports the self-rated difficulty of engaging in
seven activities of daily living that are indicators of functional
health. These are walking one block; walking across a room;
dressing oneself; bathing or showering; eating, such as cutting
up one's food; getting in or out of bed; and using the toilet,
including getting up and down. NSHAP also reports the self-
rated difficulty of driving a car during the day and also at
night. These items may be used as individual measures of
functional health or may be combined into a single index that
indicates whether the respondent has difficulty with any of the
listed activities. Table 6 shows the proportion of respondents
experiencing difficulty with these different daily activities.
Morbidity.--In NSHAP, respondents were asked whether
they had been diagnosed with particular health conditions.
Specifically, they were asked, "Has a medical doctor ever
told you that you have (had) . . ." x health condition.

NSHAP MEASURES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS i71
Respondents were asked about health conditions that were
hypothesized to have an association with social life and
sexuality, conditions that are known to be highly prevalent
in older populations, and conditions predictive of mortality.
These health conditions may be coded separately as indi-
vidual measures of morbidity if researchers are interested in
the presence or absence of a particular condition.
If researchers are interested in the presence of multiple
conditions, a measure of comorbidity may be constructed.
Comorbidity, or the concomitant presence of multiple condi-
tions, has been shown to increase the risk of mortality. That is,
given an individual has a certain disease, the concomitant
presence of other diseases significantly increases risk of death
in both the short run and the long run. In addition to the self-
reports of individual diseases itemized previously, NSHAP
reports a comorbidity index (comorb) of the total number of
health conditions (from a list of specified conditions) reported
by the individual. The list of conditions that contribute to this
index is derived from the set of conditions that define the
Charlson comorbidity index. Developed by Charlson, Pom-
pei,Ales, and McKenzie (1987), the original Charlson comor-
bidity index is a weighted average of 19 health conditions that
have been shown to be predictive of mortality. The conditions
are weighted according to the degree to which they increase
the risk of mortality, and this composite index has been shown
to be highly predictive of 1- and 10-year mortality rates.
The Charlson index was originally validated in a research
context in which health conditions were identified using pa-
tient medical records. Katz, Chang, Sangha, Fossel, and
Bates (1996) subsequently adapted the Charlson index for
use in a questionnaire setting. In NSHAP, we followed the
model of Katz and colleagues, asking respondents to report
on any previous diagnoses of health conditions.
Because NSHAP does not ask about all conditions that are
included in the Charlson/Katz indexes, it is not possible to
generate an index that is strictly comparable to these indexes;
nevertheless, an unweighted count of conditions (as reported
in the variable comorb) is likely to be informative as a gross
measure of disease burden. We also encourage researchers to
develop composite measures that are most relevant for their
research needs. Table 7 reports the presence of selected health
conditions in the NSHAP sample, and Table 8 gives summary
statistics of the unweighted comorbidity index comorb.
Self-reported health.--Self-reported health is a person's
subjective assessment of his or her own well-being. Self-
reported health has been shown to be associated with a wide
array of more specific health measures, such as sensory
function, functional health, cognition, disease, and sexual
dysfunction (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen 1999; Ostbye et al.,
2006). In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that
self-reported health is as useful an indicator of health and
mortality as physician diagnosis (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999;
Maddox & Douglas, 1973; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982). In the
context of NSHAP and all its other health and morbidity
measures, a self-reported measure of health is useful be-
cause it captures the concept of health as overall well-being
and not simply the absence of disease (Ross & Wu, 1996).
Table 9 lists the distribution of self-reported health relative
to others of the same age group.
Discussion and Analytical Recommendations
Most chronic conditions and diseases associated with ag-
ing cannot be measured by a single question or biomeasure.

The following section provides a discussion of a few impor-
tant chronic diseases/conditions currently affecting older
adults in the United States and provides a description of the
measures collected in NSHAP that are associated with these
diseases/conditions.
Measures of Cardiovascular Diseases
Diseases associated with the cardiovascular system, in-
cluding heart diseases, cerebral vascular disease, and pe-
ripheral artery disease, are consistently the number one
cause of mortality in the United States (Neyer et al., 2007).
Significant differences in prevalence and mortality rates as-
sociated with cardiovascular diseases have been reported by
gender, race, and ethnic group (Barnett et al., 2001; Casper
et al., 1999; Rosamond et al., 2007). These disparities in
cardiovascular health and its associated mortality risk can-
not be accounted for by purely genetic, biological, social, or
behavioral factors but are most likely caused by the com-
plex interaction of all these factors.
NSHAP includes several measures of cardiovascular dis-
ease. In the morbidity section of the interview, participants
were asked if they had ever had hypertension, heart disease,
or a stroke. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
also directly measured. Systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures are common measures of hypertension, one of the
most common cardiovascular diseases. Current guideliness
suggested by the Centers for Discase Control define hyper-
tension as a systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg or 90
mm Hg diastolic. Blood pressure levels between 120 and
139 mm Hg systolic or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic are considered
to be prehypertensive and associated with an increased risk
of developing cardiovascular diaease (Chobaman et al., 2003).
Levels of C-reactive protein, a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (Koenig et al., 1999; Pai et al., 2004; Ridker, 2003;
Ridker, Cushman, Stampfer, Tracy, & Hennekens, 1997;
Ridker, Rifai, Rose, Buring, & Cook, 2002), were also mea-
sured from dried blood spots.
Measures of Diabetes
Diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality among persons aged 65 and older (Desai, Zhang, &
Hennessy, 1999). About 20% of persons in this age group
are estimated to have diabetes, with another 25% in predia-
betic stages (Samos & Roos, 1998). Moreover, because dia-
betes can be asymptomatic for many years, about 50% of
older individuals with diabetes are thought to be undiag-
nosed (Meneilly & Tessier, 2001).
NSHAP includes two different measures directly related
to diabetes. The first measure indicates whether an individ-
ual reports ever having been told by a medical doctor that he
or she has diabetes or high blood sugar. This self-report
measure may be interpreted directly as an indicator of diag-
nosed diabetes, or it may be used as part of a composite co-
morbidity score (discussed in the morbidity section). The
second NSHAP measure associated with diabetes--assessed
from blood spot samples obtained from respondents--is the
percentage of hemoglobin attached to glucose. This measure
is known as glycosylated hemoglobin, or HbA1c. Details on
the collection and properties of the HbA1c biomarker are
discussed in Williams and McDade (this issue).
Because HbA1c is a relatively new biomarker in the con-
text of population-based surveys, there are as yet no stan-
dard guidelines for its use in social science research. There
are, however, several considerations that might be useful to
bear in mind in using the HbA1c measure for such research.

NSHAP MEASURES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS i73
First, interpreted directly as a measure of glycemic control
for patients with diabetes, as is done in a clinical setting, an
HbA1c level of 7% is an important target (American Diabe-
tes Association, 2003). This level of HbA1c is thought to be
the threshold level below which there are many fewer health
complications from diabetes (healthy persons without dia-
betes have HbA1c levels 6%).
Second, although it is tempting to use HbA1c as a popu-
lation measure of morbidity associated with diabetes, an
analysis using HbA1c in this way is somewhat complicated.
The main problem is that two individuals with the same
HbA1c level may have very different morbidity profiles, de-
pending on whether they have been diagnosed and are under
treatment. For example, a "normal" HbA1c reading may
identify either an individual who truly does not have diabe-
tes or an individual who has diabetes but is currently con-
trolling it through medication or lifestyle modification; the
second person is likely to have already had some pathology
related to diabetes affecting his or her health, and this is not
detected in the HbA1c measure. Thus, to use HbA1c as a
morbidity measure, it is best to combine this measure with
information on whether the respondent reports having been
diagnosed with diabetes and with information from the
medication log indicating diabetic treatments such as sulfo-
nylureas, biguanides, or insulin.
Measures of Allostatic Load
The concept of allostatic load has been proposed as a
mechanism by which environmental factors can affect phys-
iology and result in differential health outcomes, especially
at older ages (McEwen, 2002; McEwen & Seeman, 1999;
McEwen & Stellar, 1993). Allostatic load is the cumulative
cost of maintaining allostasis (Sterling & Eyer, 1988)--a
relatively stable and steady state. Over time, the dysregula-
tion of the systems involved in maintaining allostasis, espe-
cially those involved with the stress response, may occur
and result in declining health and the development of chronic
disease. A high allostatic load has been associated with in-
creased risk of mortality, cognitive and physical function
decline, and increase in general health decline (McEwen,
2007). Social factors such as socioeconomic status and so-
cial integration and racial and ethnic group have been asso-
ciated with allostatic load (Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, &
Bound, 2006; T. Seeman et al., 2004; T. E. Seeman, Singer,
Ryff, Dienberg, & Levy-Storms, 2002).
Measures of allostatic load include direct measures of the
primary mediators of the physiological stress response of the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pi-
tuitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (McEwen, 2007) as well as mea-
sures associated with the chronic effects of the SNS and HPA
axis activity (McEwen & Seeman, 1999) including cardio-
vascular activity and atherosclerosis development, metabo-
lism and adiposity, and glucose metabolism. Not all the
measures generally used to measure allostatic load are avail-
able in the NSHAP data; however, measures of most of the
above-mentioned systems are available. Further, because of
the cumulative nature of allostatic load, a true measure of al-
lostatic load would optimally include measures of change in
these biological markers over time, but this was not possible.
NSHAP does not measure stress directly but does include
measures of perceived stress. Measures of perceived stress
use a four-question modification of Cohen's Perceived Stress
Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Perception
of anxiety is also measured in NSHAP using a modification
of the seven-item subset of the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Further discussion of
these NSHAP measures and other quality of life measures
can be found in Drum and colleagues (this issue). However,
dehydroxyepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels are assessed from
saliva, and DHEA has been associated with HPA axis activ-
ity (for a more detailed discussion, see Gavrilova and col-
leagues, this issue ). Measures of cardiovascular activity and
atherosclerosis development in NSHAP include heart rate,
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein.
Metabolism and adiposity are measured using BMI and waist
circumference, and glucose metabolism is measured with
HbA1c. For more detailed discussions on measuring allo-
static load, see, for example, McEwen and Seeman (1999),
Seeman and colleagues (2004), Seeman and colleagues
(2002), and Seplaki, Goldman, Weinstein, and Lin (2006).
Conclusions
NSHAP provides a combination of self-reported-rated and
direct biomeasures associated with health. The main objec-
tive of this research was to provide the means by which to
understand the variability in health outcomes in older adults
by integrating biological and social measures. By providing
both self-reported and assessed measures, we hope that when
combined with the breadth of available social measures, we
are providing a rich source of data to explore in an attempt to
understand health outcomes in aging adults.
