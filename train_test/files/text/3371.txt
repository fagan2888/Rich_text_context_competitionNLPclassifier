Ethics and Best Practices in Data Sharing in Low and Middle Income Settings
Data-sharing is increasingly seen as an important requirement
for effective and efficient biomedical research by researchers
and research funders. It is noteworthy, however, that many of
the arguments presented for greater sharing of data are
grounded in empirical claims about its potential to generate
more and better science and to enable more efficient use of
research resources for the greater good. In principle, these
claims are amenable to testing and evaluation. It may be that
some approaches to data sharing are more likely to promote
effective and efficient research than others, and it is also pos-
sible that the most effective and sustainable approach may vary
between settings and different forms of data or research. One
factor in the sustainability of any approach to data sharing is
likely to be the extent to which it is compatible with enduring
collaborative partnerships between researchers in their capac-
ity as data producers and/or data users. Another related factor
is likely to be the extent to which proposed approaches to data
sharing reflect a reasonable alignment between the mandate
for data-sharing claimed, often in the "public interest" by
researchers, research funders and journals, and the social
license important stakeholders, including research participants,
communities, research ethics committees, and the wider public
would consider themselves to have given for data sharing
(Carter, Laurie, & Dixon-Woods, 2015).
Where the social license for sharing individual-level
data from clinical and public health research and the man-
date claimed by research actors are reasonably well-aligned,
there may be grounds for confidence that more effective
data sharing will indeed lead to more successful and appro-
priate scientific research. Where, however, there is a signifi-
cant gap between them, it seems less likely that the
widespread adoption of data-sharing practices will be sup-
ported without significant investment of time and resources
into the building of trust and confidence. Moreover, where
there is a lack of support from the public, key data gover-
nors (such as research ethics committees), researchers, and
research institutions, there is good reason to hypothesize
that research progress may be undermined by lack of trust
and/or confidence.
While important in all research settings, such consider-
ations are likely to be particularly important, both morally

Abstract
Sharing individual-level data from clinical and public health research is increasingly being seen as a core requirement for
effective and efficient biomedical research. This article discusses the results of a systematic review and multisite qualitative
study of key stakeholders' perspectives on best practices in ethical data sharing in low- and middle-income settings. Our
research suggests that for data sharing to be effective and sustainable, multiple social and ethical requirements need to be
met. An effective model of data sharing will be one in which considered judgments will need to be made about how best to
achieve scientific progress, minimize risks of harm, promote fairness and reciprocity, and build and sustain trust.

and instrumentally, in research conducted in low- and mid-
dle-income settings where social justice concerns are at
their most acute. Against this backdrop, significant progress
in data sharing, even where it is believed to be capable of
contributing to scientific knowledge addressing the global
burden of disease, is likely to require the development of
models of good data-sharing practice capable of command-
ing the trust and confidence of relevant stakeholders. These
will need to be grounded in shared understandings of what
is required for data sharing to be "equitable, ethical, and
efficient" (Walport & Brest, 2011). Careful consideration of
stakeholders' differing interests in the development of gov-
ernance policies and processes is needed to enable sound
judgment of the balance between the need to share data in a
way that maximizes their use, while ensuring that appropri-
ate protections are in place to minimize potential harms
(Parker etal., 2009).
In this article, we report on the results of a literature
review and qualitative studies conducted in five low- and
middle-income settings, which explored the experiences
and views of key stakeholders about best practices in
sharing individual-level data from clinical and public
health research (Bull, Roberts, & Parker, 2015; Cheah
et
al., 2015; Denny, Silaigwana, Wassenaar, Bull, &
Parker, 2015; Hate etal., 2015; Jao etal., 2015; Merson
etal., 2015; Parker & Bull, 2015). It is noteworthy that
the systematic review was unable to identify any empiri-
cal studies of stakeholders' views about best practices in
sharing individual-level data from clinical and public
health research in low- and middle-income settings.
Before discussing the findings of our own research, we
summarize the main arguments in favor of, and concerns
about, data sharing in the literature.
The Potential Benefits of Data Sharing
It is increasingly widely believed that the greater sharing of
de-identified individual-level public health and medical
research data would be of high value. Such sharing has the
potential to enable verification, replication, and expansion
of research results and to provide means of addressing
biases, deficiencies, and dishonesty in published and
unpublished research (Chan, Hróbjartsson, Haahr,
Gøtzsche, & Altman, 2004; Chan etal., 2014; Rodwin &
Abramson, 2012; Ross, Lehman, & Gross, 2012; Smith,
1994; Wieseler, McGauran, Kerekes, & Kaiser, 2012). It is
also claimed that shared data sets have the potential to gen-
erate and enable the addressing of novel research ques-
tions, inform the design of future research, contribute to
powerful meta-analyses, and to support the building of
capacity in analysis (Anderson & Merry, 2009; Dove,
Knoppers, & Zawati, 2014; Manju & Buckley, 2012;
Vallance & Chalmers, 2013). It is argued that researchers
and research institutions may benefit from sharing data, as
the visibility and relevance of their research increases,
potentially leading to increased collaborations and research
funding (Pisani, Whitworth, Zaba, & Abou-Zahr, 2010a;
Piwowar etal., 2008).
These arguments are important because, if the empirical
claims upon which they are based are true, they suggest that
sharing data has the potential to make an important contri-
bution to scientific progress and improved health. This
would be achieved by expanding the knowledge base used
to inform not only research but also the ethical review of
research, health care policy development, purchasing deci-
sions, regulatory review of novel treatments, and clinical
care (Gotzsche, 2011; Haines & Gabor Miklos, 2011;
Wieseler etal., 2012).
In addition to these important claims, which have an
ethical dimension, several additional explicitly moral argu-
ments have been made for greater data sharing. These
include arguments about the ethical importance of maxi-
mizing the value and utility of data sets and of minimizing
the costs and burdens of unnecessary duplication of research
(Doshi, Goodman, & Ioannidis, 2013; Rani, Bekedam, &
Buckley, 2011). Data sharing is considered to enable the
best use of valuable resources, and to appropriately honor
the contributions of research participants (Gotzsche, 2012;
Langat et
al., 2011; Mello et
al., 2013; Sommer, 2010;
Strech & Littmann, 2012). Moreover, it is argued that the
interests of the wider public, who when asked tend to sup-
port research, also warrant treating data as a public good to
beshared(Tangcharoensathien,Boonperm,&Jongudomsuk,
2010; Toronto International Data Release Workshop
Authors, 2009).
Concerns About Data Sharing
While the potential value of data sharing is increasingly rec-
ognized, several important enduring concerns need to be
addressed for data sharing to be both successful and appro-
priate. The literature suggests that many of these concerns
are scientific. As with primary research, the results of sec-
ondary research may be flawed if analysis is inappropriate
or biased, or if reanalyses are based on misinterpretations of
the data or are conducted to push specific agendas (Pearce
& Smith, 2011; Wieseler etal., 2012). The concern is that
this may be more likely in secondary research where those
who use the data are removed from the context of data col-
lection and curation. Concerns also arise from the belief
that effective data sharing is resource intensive. Curating
data for sharing and developing appropriate data-sharing
policies and processes takes significant expertise, effort,
and resources (Mello etal., 2013; Nisen & Rockhold, 2013;
Whitworth, 2010). Monitoring uses of secondary data,
responding to queries from data accessors, and evaluating
results of secondary research will also require appropriate
resourcing.
304 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
Other concerns relate to the impact of data sharing on the
researchers who collect data and produce shared data sets.
Mandated data sharing could affect researchers' abilities to
publish primary findings from their studies, and to file rel-
evant patents, which might in turn create disincentives to
fund and conduct primary research (Mello et
al., 2013;
Savage & Vickers, 2009; Vickers, 2006). A lack of clarity
about ownership rights and intellectual property issues may
make it difficult to determine who has the authority to
decide how data should be shared (Anderson & Merry,
2009; Manju & Buckley, 2012; Mello etal., 2013). Primary
researchers have also expressed concerns about reputational
damage if their analyses and findings are challenged in sec-
ondary research (Savage & Vickers, 2009; Smith, 1994).
Perhaps the most commonly expressed concern, however, is
that primary researchers' scientific activities may be under-
mined by data sharing in situations where secondary users,
who may be better resourced, are able to utilize data more
quickly than those who produced it. Given the importance
of peer-reviewed publications in funding decisions and aca-
demic advancement, sufficient opportunities for primary
researchers to publish the findings of research are critical
(Coady & Wagner, 2013; Rathi et
al., 2012; Ross et
al.,
2012), as is appropriate recognition for producing and
curating data sets for sharing (Langat etal., 2011; Pisani &
AbouZahr, 2010).
Finally, and importantly, concerns have been expressed
about the potential for data sharing to harm or to fail to
respect the interests of participants. A major concern is to
ensure that research participants' privacy is protected and
the confidentiality of identifying data is preserved while
maintaining the utility of data sets (Castellani, 2013; Sieber,
2006; White, 2013). Policies and processes for de-identifying
data continue to develop (de Wolf, Sieber, Steel, & Zarate,
2006; Hughes, Wells, McSorley, & Freeman, 2014; Zarin,
2013), but the possibility of identifying participants, directly
or deductively, particularly when data sets may be com-
bined, remains of concern (European Medicines Agency,
2014; Goldacre, 2013). In addition to these concerns, there
has also been much discussion about the implications of
data sharing for consent. There is some debate about the
need to inform participants that de-identified data will be
shared (de Wolf, Sieber, Steel, & Zarate, 2005; Gotzsche,
2011; Greenhalgh, 2009), and, if so, how best to notify par-
ticipants about the possible ramifications of sharing (Mello
etal., 2013; Nisen & Rockhold, 2013; Toronto International
Data Release Workshop Authors, 2009). Concerns have
been raised that if data are released without explicit approval
from participants, the delicate trust relationship between
researchers and participants will be harmed (Greenhalgh,
2009; Pearce & Smith, 2011; Piwowar etal., 2008). There
is broad agreement that consent is required, but some dis-
agreement about what this implies. Broad consent to data
sharing is becoming increasingly common and accepted
(Nisen & Rockhold, 2013; Pisani & AbouZahr, 2010), but
some commentators have argued that explicit and dynamic
consent for all research uses on each occasion is preferable
(Kaye etal., 2015).
Data Sharing in Low- and Middle-Income
Settings
Most published literature on data sharing focuses on
research in high-income settings. However, although the lit-
erature is limited, versions of the arguments above have
also begun to appear in literature concerning research in
low- and middle-income settings (Manju & Buckley, 2012;
Sankoh & Ijsselmuiden, 2011; Tangcharoensathien etal.,
2010). Some of this discussion has arisen in the context of
the growth of genomic research in low-income settings
(Parker et
al., 2009) and increasingly, particularly in
response to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, calls
have been made for facilitating timely data sharing to
inform responses to public health emergencies and disease
outbreaks (Langat et
al., 2011; Yozwiak, Schaffner, &
Sabeti, 2015).
While many of the above arguments are relevant to the
sharing of research data in any setting, there are some sig-
nificant differences. For example, while limited resources
may be a hindrance to data sharing in higher income set-
tings, they are likely to be a significant barrier to ethical
data sharing in lower income settings (Manju & Buckley,
2012; Rani et
al., 2011; Sankoh & Ijsselmuiden, 2011;
Tangcharoensathien etal., 2010; Walport & Brest, 2011;
Whitworth, 2010). For high-quality individual-level data to
be shared in databases with long-term sustainability, signifi-
cant investment in human resources, technology, and infra-
structure will be required. Training, mentoring, and career
pathways also need to be provided for a range of specialist
support staff to document and curate data sets and manage
data-release processes.
Furthermore, the arguments about the potential impact
of data sharing on primary data producers are also likely to
be much more pressing in the case of researchers and
research institutes in low- and middle-income settings. In
such settings, differences in capacity between primary data
producers and secondary data users, most likely in high-
income settings, who may conduct very rapid analyses of
the data, are much greater.
It is against this background that we conducted a multisite
empirical ethics research project using qualitative research
methods to examine stakeholder experiences of, and views
about, best practices in sharing individual-level data from clin-
ical and public health research. Interviews and focus groups
were conducted with key stakeholders, including health pro-
fessionals, researchers, and community representatives in
India, Vietnam, Thailand, South Africa, and Kenya. The find-
ings of the individual studies are published as separate articles
Bull et al. 305
in this special issue (Cheah etal., 2015; Denny, Silaigwana,
Wassenaar, Bull, & Parker, 2015; Hate etal., 2015; Jao etal.,
2015; Merson etal., 2015). In what follows in this article, we
present an overarching analysis of the findings of the project as
a whole. While this analysis is not easily generalizable to other
low- and middle-income settings, we believe it offers some
interesting and important insights which are likely to be of use to
researchers, research ethics committees, funders, and policy
makers. It also suggests a number of potential avenues for
research in these and other settings. In the sections below, we
present our findings under two broad headings. The first is an

views about important requirements for good ethical data-shar-
ingpractice.Thesecondidentifies fourways forwardinthinking
through the practicalities of good data-sharing practice.
Core Considerations in Ethical Data
Sharing
Taken together, the analyses of the five individual studies
suggest four key factors as important considerations in judg-
ing whether any particular data-sharing initiative is likely to
be an example of good data-sharing practice and likely to
command support in the development of models of data-
sharing practice. These are the value of data sharing, mini-
mizing harm, promoting fairness and reciprocity, and trust.
The Value of Data Sharing
Echoing a broad consensus in the published literature, there
was general support at all five empirical study sites for data
sharing among the stakeholders, particularly among senior
and junior researchers. Attitudes of community members
and participants were typically more cautious, although sup-
port for data sharing often grew as they became familiar
with the concepts involved, the potential advantages of shar-
ing, and safeguards that could be implemented to address
concerns. What this suggests is that for all stakeholders, an
assessment of the potential benefits of data sharing is likely
to be an important factor in the question of whether or not it
constitutes an example of good data-sharing practice. It is
important to note, however, that this is not the overriding
consideration. The benefits of data sharing are seen as one
factor in any such judgment. In the following, we discuss
stakeholders'views about the other factors seen as important
requirements for best practice in data sharing.
Minimizing Harm
Concerns about minimizing harms of research focused on
ensuring that participants' interests were not adversely
affected when individual-level data were shared. At all
sites, protecting participants' privacy and ensuring that
identifying data remained confidential were considered to
be of key importance by all stakeholders, reflecting a con-
sensus in the reviewed literature (Bull, Roberts & Parker,
2015). However, reflecting the broader discussions of harm
in the literature outlined above, de-identification of data
was not necessarily considered sufficient in itself to mini-
mize the risk of harm. Risks of harm were associated both
with the sensitivity of the data sets collected and with the
uses that could be made of the data. Participants described a
wide range of data sets that were likely to be sensitive, but
noted that all data could potentially be sensitive, which
made it important to understand both the context in which
data had been collected, and proposed secondary uses of it.
Particular concerns were raised about secondary research
with de-identified data contributing to the stigmatization of
identifiable communities, populations, and even countries.
Data and secondary research about topics such as disease
prevalence and socioeconomic status had the potential to
increase stigmatization when results were insensitively
reported, or when secondary users had vested interests. In
some cases, more direct harms could potentially result from
data sharing, for example, if data about participants in
impoverished informal settlements collected for public
health research purposes was accessed by secondary users
to inform accelerated resettlement.
In addition to potential harms to participants, researchers
at all sites echoed concerns in the literature discussed above
about the potential for data sharing to adversely affect
research capacity and career development in low- and mid-
dle-income settings. Concerns were raised, for example,
about primary researchers being side-lined by better
resourced institutions conducting secondary research.
Secondary users' critiques of the quality of data sets and of
the primary research could affect primary researchers'repu-
tations, ability to attract research funding, and career devel-
opment. If insufficient resources were available for
appropriate preparation and curation of data sets prior to
mandatory sharing, and to respond to secondary users' que-
ries during such sharing, then resources might be wasted in
secondary analyses which were unable to generate valid
answers to the research question.
Promoting Fairness and Reciprocity
At all sites, the importance of ensuring that data-sharing
practices did not increase existing inequalities was consid-
ered fundamental, reflecting discussions in the literature
about the need for data sharing to be ethical and equitable.

Participants focused not only on the importance of protect-
ing stakeholders from harm but also promoting their rele-
vant interests. In such discussions, community stakeholders
noted that their contributions to the development of a valu-
able resource suggested that the resource should be used to
directly or indirectly benefit their community. There was
discussion about the possibility of direct benefits accruing
to participants from secondary research, but no general con-
sensus that direct benefits were a requirement of ethical
data sharing. Community stakeholders in multiple settings
discussed the importance of secondary research providing
indirect benefits, such as addressing health issues of rele-
vance to their communities. If such issues were not to be
addressed, then it was considered important that secondary
research should have the potential to advance health more
generally.
Researchers' perspectives were similar to those high-
lighted in the literature, emphasizing the importance of
ensuring that data sharing was conducted in a way that did
not adversely affect their careers or ability to conduct health
research of relevance to the communities in which they
were based. Research data were perceived to be a valuable
resource created and managed with considerable effort. The
importance of these data was not limited to their value in
addressing specific research questions of relevance to com-
munities, but also linked to their potential to leverage fund-
ing and capacity development for future research. Echoing
discussions in the literature, a core requirement of fair data
sharing was that primary data producers received appropri-
ate recognition of their role in producing valuable data sets.
Capacity building may be needed to support researchers'
effective and timely analyses of their own data sets, to
enable effective participation in larger collaborations ana-
lyzing multiple linked data sets, and to enable identification
and secondary analysis of relevant data sets to address top-
ics of interest. Some stakeholders went further and sug-
gested that principles of reciprocity require that data
producers should be routinely offered the opportunity to be
involved in secondary analyses of their data, with appropri-
ate acknowledgment of this additional contribution.
Trust
The final core theme that arose in conversations with stake-
holder groups at all sites was the importance to partici-
pants, communities, researchers, and the wider public of
ensuring that data were shared in both a trusted and trust-
worthy manner, reflecting discussions about sample and
data sharing in the literature (Erlich etal., 2014; Kaye,
Heeney, Hawkins, de Vries, & Boddington, 2009; Murtagh
etal., 2012; Tindana, Molyneux, Bull, & Parker, 2014).
Data sets, primary researchers, secondary data users, and
data-sharing policies and processes all needed to be trusted
for effective and ethical data sharing. Stakeholders noted
that governance policies and processes for data sharing
could promote trust by ensuring that proposals for second-
ary access were evaluated by parties trusted to identify
potential harms to stakeholders and to promote their inter-
ests. Mechanisms for building trust when developing and
implementing data-sharing policies and practices included
engagement with government health authorities, commu-
nity consultation, stakeholder representation, and provid-
ing feedback about the results of data sharing.
Researchers highlighted the need for data-sharing poli-
cies and processes that would permit them to fulfill their
obligations to research participants. In addition, trust needed
to be built that the production and sharing of data sets would
be appropriately recognized and rewarded in future career
development and funding applications. Stakeholders noted
that secondary researchers would need to be trusted to com-
ply with the conditions under which they were granted
access to the data sets and that enforcement of data access
conditions could be challenging.
Stakeholders' concerns about trustworthiness were often
proportionate to their levels of concern about harms and
fairness in data sharing. For data sharing to be ethical, it
needed to be shared in ways that minimized harm and
appropriately promoted participants' interests. At one
extreme, stakeholders noted that when research was con-
ducted on sensitive topics, research participants were only
likely to provide accurate data to primary researchers whom
they trusted. They might hold an expectation that the data
would remain confidential to the research team. In such
cases, careful consideration of whether data sets could be
shared at all would need to be undertaken, and, if so, of
what governance measures would promote and sustain
trust. At the other extreme were data sets considered to be
less sensitive, such as subsets of clinical measurements
relied on in published research articles. There could be less
need to scrutinize and control uses made of such data sets,
and they might even be released via open access
mechanisms.
Ethical Data Sharing: Ways Forward
Having identified four factors seen by stakeholders as key
considerations in the development of and judgment about
good ethical practice in data sharing in low- and middle-
income settings, we explore in more detail below some of
the areas identified as building blocks of good practice:
consent, governance processes, data-sharing policies, and
approaches to capacity building.
Seeking Consent to Data Sharing
There was substantial variation in views within and between
sites about best practices in seeking consent to prospective data
sharing. Two related topics emerged as core considerations:
Bull et al. 307
the ethical acceptability of broad consent to data sharing, and
the nature and extent of information to be provided to partici-
pants about data sharing if consent is to be considered appro-
priately informed.
When seeking participants' consent to sharing data in
genetic and genomic research, approaches range from seek-
ing broad consent at the inception of research (Mascalzoni,
Hicks, Pramstaller, & Wjst, 2008) to using online platforms
to enable participants to manage dynamic ongoing consent
to sharing (Kaye etal., 2015; Mathews & Jamal, 2014).
While views differ about whether requesting broad consent
to unspecified future research is respectful of participants
and can be sufficiently informed to be valid, it is clear that
broad consent approaches are increasingly widely accepted
(Caulfield, 2007; Sheehan, 2011). In this study, the ethical
acceptability of broad consent to future research purposes
attracted varying views from stakeholders within and
between sites. Many arguments in favor of broad consent
were pragmatic, with researchers referring to the difficulty
and expense of recontacting research participants, perhaps
repeatedly, for consent to specific secondary research pro-
posals. Requirements to recontact participants for specific
consent were also considered to have ethical implications in
settings where web-based interfaces for ongoing manage-
ment of consent to sharing were not practicable. In contexts
where contacting participants to reconsent would need to be
via shared telephones, or by physical visits from field staff,
seeking specific consent could risk harming local partici-
pants by identifying them as having taken part in a specific
study. Moreover, participants might not wish to be involved
in ongoing decision making about secondary research and
could find being contacted to reconsent burdensome and
inconvenient.
There was some consensus that seeking broad consent
to data sharing could be ethically acceptable, if accompa-
nied by appropriate information in an accessible form at
the time of consent and by effective and trusted data-sharing
governance procedures, a similar finding to a review of
biobank participants' attitudes to consent (Simon etal.,
2011). In some cases, broad consent to a range of research
areas might be sought, such as research related to health
care or to improving statistical methods, an approach
taken in genomic research from low- and middle-income
settings (Parker etal., 2009). While generally supportive
of broad consent models, stakeholders noted that policies
would need to be in place to determine what should hap-
pen if access to data was requested for different purposes
from those discussed in the consent process, or if access
was sought from specific groups, such as commercial
organizations.
There was significant variation in views about the
amount and type of information that should be provided to
participants when seeking consent to data sharing. There
was general consensus that, given participants' differing
levels of willingness to share data, if participants are to be
respected, they must be informed that their data could be
shared and given the opportunity to opt out of sharing if
desired. Moreover, if information about sharing was with-
held during consent and community engagement processes,
and subsequently became known to research participants
and communities, this could adversely affect trust in
researchers and impact on willingness to take part in future
research. Opinions about how much information should be
provided ranged from explaining that data would be shared,
but providing minimal further information, to providing
explicit details of data-sharing plans and secondary analy-
ses. Where it was considered important to provide more
than minimal information, stakeholders discussed the
importance of informing participants about why data shar-
ing was proposed, what kinds of secondary users could
request access, for what purposes, and the processes that
would be used to govern data sharing.
Given the novelty of data sharing, and the range of opin-
ions about the nature and extent of information that should
be provided about sharing, further research is needed to
determine what information should be provided to research
participants in varying contexts when data sharing is antici-
pated. Insights gained during the development of data col-
lection materials for this study, and from the views of
stakeholders, point to the need for further research to deter-
mine how best to explain this complex and unfamiliar con-
cept to participants in a comprehensible manner in
conjunction with other information they receive about a
proposed study.
Governing Data Sharing
When considering how best to manage data sharing,
researchers at each site expressed a strong preference for
sharing data within collaborative relationships. This was the
most familiar form of sharing for most researchers and con-
sidered important to enable them to fulfill obligations to
minimize potential risks of sharing and appropriately pro-
mote participants' interests. Researchers noted that sharing
data within collaborations supported trust building and
capacity development. In addition, collaboration could
improve the quality of research by ensuring that the research
context was understood and errors addressed, and could
ensure appropriate recognition of researchers'contributions
to secondary research. The advantages of sharing clinical
and public health data through collaborative data-sharing
arrangements in a range of low- and middle-income settings
have been recognized in the literature (Manju & Buckley,
2012; Tangcharoensathien etal., 2010; Whitworth, 2010).
Given strong support for, and perceived advantages of, col-
laborative data sharing, we suggest that this issue be given
careful consideration when developing policies and pro-
cesses for data sharing in low- and middle-income settings.
308 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
Further research into the benefits and disadvantages of such
approaches would be valuable. Our findings suggest that
the development of larger collaborative approaches to
research as a context for data sharing might offer an inter-
esting and novel mechanism for effective, trusted data shar-
ing in low- and middle-income settings.
If data are to be shared with secondary researchers with
whom there is no collaborative relationship, the views of
stakeholders in this study were similar to those reported in
the literature and emphasized the importance of transpar-
ent, accountable, efficient, fair, and proportionate gover-
nance processes (Bull, Roberts & Parker, 2015). Such
processes were considered necessary to minimize potential
harms of research and enable researchers to fulfill their
obligations to research participants. Views differed between
sites about the appropriate composition of governance
groups. In some settings, it was considered appropriate for
scientific and research ethics committees to review data-
sharing proposals, while in others, the value of establishing
novel data-sharing committees or appointing data manag-
ers was considered. Views also differed about which stake-
holder interests should be represented in governance
processes and how best to do so. Given the novelty of shar-
ing data from clinical and public health research in the sites
in this study, some stakeholders discussed the value of
reviewing the differing approaches to governing data shar-
ing currently in place in a range of settings, as well as
guidelines for the constitution of governance procedures.
Among all stakeholders, the importance of developing pol-
icies and processes to guide reasoned data-sharing deci-
sions was emphasized, as discussed below.
Data-Sharing Policies
To inform best practices in sharing data from clinical and
public health research, stakeholders identified a number of
areas where policies and standard operating procedures
would be valuable. Priority topics to address included the
following:
·
· Quality control and preparation of qualitative and
quantitative data sets for sharing, including guide-
lines for de-identification of data.
·
· Preparation of metadata to accompany data sets,
including metadata about the context in which the
data were collected.
·
· The design and conduct of consent processes, includ-
ing core information to be provided to research
participants.
·
· Information that secondary researchers seeking to
access data sets should provide.
·
· Conditions that secondary researchers should be
obliged to comply with when accessing, analyzing,
and reporting data, including acknowledgment of the
primary data source and researchers.
·
· The composition and conduct of bodies overseeing
data release.
·
· Guidelines for prioritization of data sets for release
and criteria for determining how specific data sets
should be released.
·
· Guidelines for case-by-case review of data-access
applications where appropriate.
Stakeholders' views about the importance of developing
consensus standards for data sharing have been echoed in
the literature (Manju & Buckley, 2012; Mello etal., 2013;
Piwowar et
al., 2008; Rani et
al., 2011; Vallance &
Chalmers, 2013). The value of developing national guid-
ance for data sharing, to inform the development of institu-
tional policies and processes, and of receiving clear
guidance from research funders about data-release require-
ments and mechanisms has been recognized in the literature
and by stakeholders in this study (Manju & Buckley, 2012;
Toronto International Data Release Workshop Authors,
2009).
Current data-sharing policies and processes can poten-
tially provide a valuable resource to inform the develop-
ment of national guidance and institutional governance for
data sharing in low- and middle-income settings (Alter &
Vardigan, 2015; Herbst et
al., 2015; Lötter & van Zyl,
2015). As outlined above, care will be needed to ensure
that policies and processes can enable the identification of
data sets and proposed secondary uses that are likely to be
sensitive in specific research contexts, and ensure that
harms are minimized and stakeholders' interests appropri-
ately promoted. In addition, funders and policy developers
in higher income settings should be informed about the pri-
orities and interests of stakeholders in low- and middle-
income settings to ensure that the policies for application
in such settings minimize harm, promote stakeholders'
interests, and build trust (Carr & Littler, 2015). There are
some existing models in which the collaborative develop-
ment of data-sharing policies and practice has been
effective (Parker etal., 2009).
Capacity Building
Researchers at all the sites emphasized the importance of
building capacity and access to sufficient resources to support
best practices in data sharing. Echoing published literature
about capacity building for data sharing in low- and middle-
income settings, multiple areas for capacity development and
appropriate resourcing were identified (Manju & Buckley,
2012; Pisani & AbouZahr, 2010; Pisani etal., 2010a; Pisani,
Whitworth, Zaba, & AbouZahr, 2010b; Rani et
al., 2011;
Sankoh & Ijsselmuiden, 2011; Tangcharoensathien et
al.,
Bull et al. 309
2010; Walport & Brest, 2011; Whitworth, 2010). Stakeholders
noted that if data sharing is to be ethical, resources and exper-
tise must be available to enable appropriate implementation of
all of the policy priorities listed above. In addition, attention
must be paid to ensuring that the management of data sharing
is not likely to undermine existing or emerging scientific and
data analysis capacity, upon which, to a significant extent, the
sustainable future of successful scientific research in such set-
tings depends. Resources are also required for the develop-
ment and maintenance of infrastructure required to support
long-term storage and sharing of data, including responding to
queries about data sets or supporting collaborative research.
Expertise in curation and good data management will also
need to be developed and supported. Principles of fairness and
reciprocity also suggest that resources be made available to
enable researchers in low- and middle-income settings to
undertake secondary analysis of data sets that have the poten-
tial to address their research priorities.
Concluding Thoughts
In this article, we have provided an overarching analysis of
the findings of a multisite empirical research study into the
views of key stakeholders in India, Kenya, Thailand,
Vietnam, and South Africa about the key requirements for
the development of sustainable models of good data-shar-
ing practice in research in low-income settings. The find-
ings of the individual studies are reported in detail elsewhere
in this issue of Journal of Empirical Research on Human
Research Ethics (Cheah etal., 2015; Denny, Silaigwana,
Wassenaar, Bull, & Parker, 2015; Hate et
al., 2015; Jao
et
al., 2015; Merson et
al., 2015). We have argued that
together the analyses from each of these five settings sug-
gest four key prima facie principles or requirements for the
assessment of the extent to which a proposed model of data
sharing exemplifies good practice and is likely to be capa-
ble of commanding the confidence of key stakeholders in
such settings. The four requirements are as follows: the
likelihood that sharing will contribute to scientific knowl-
edge relevant to health care, minimal risk of harm, fairness
and reciprocity, and trust. We have also explored what
might be important considerations arising out of this
research in relation to four areas of practice: consent, gov-
ernance, data-sharing policy, and capacity building.
We began this article by making reference to debate
about the importance, in successful and appropriate scien-
tific research, of a reasonable degree of congruence between
what the public and research participants consider them-
selves to have given scientists as a "social license," and the
mandate scientists and other research actors understand
themselves to have been given. Our research suggests that
the social license for data sharing in low-income settings
might best be understood in terms of the criteria outlined
above. Clearly, the findings of our research are not
necessarily generalizable to other settings or to other forms
of research in the settings studied. They do nonetheless sug-
gest important considerations for further discussion and
potential avenues for future research on this topic else-
where. We conclude this article with some final reflections
on the implications of our findings for education and
research.
Educational Implications
The majority of stakeholders in this study had very limited
experience of sharing individual-level health research data:
Even senior stakeholders had little experience of sharing
data with secondary researchers who were not already
known to them. If data sharing is to be promoted in such
settings, resources outlining potential benefits of data shar-
ing, ethical issues, and concerns that may arise when shar-
ing data and means of appropriately responding to these are
needed. Such resources are needed to inform researchers
who are developing data-sharing plans for grant applica-
tions and protocols submitted for ethical review, ethical
committees reviewing data-sharing proposals, data-access
managers, and community advisory boards seeking to rep-
resent participants' and community interests.
To assist in addressing these educational needs, we have
developed an open access online resource focusing on ethics
and best practices in sharing individual-level data in low- and
middle-income settings, which is available at https://bioeth-
icsresearchreview.tghn.org/research-data-sharing/. A core
component is a free online-certified course designed to sup-
port researchers and research ethics committees seeking to
build capacity in data-sharing ethics. Additional resources
include a compilation of relevant guidance, policies, and
peer-reviewed publications, as well as links to data-sharing
repositories from a range of settings. Open-access discussion
groups and blogs hosted within the site enable stakeholders
from around the world to further develop the resource and to
converse about ethical aspects of data sharing and best prac-
tices in addressing these.
Research Agenda
As discussed above, the systematic literature review under-
taken as part of this study was unable to identify any prior
empirical research into stakeholders' perspectives about
ethical aspects of sharing individual-level data from clinical
and public health in low- and middle-income settings (Bull,
Roberts & Parker, 2015). Consequently, we believe that
more research is needed on all aspects of data sharing in
low- and middle-income settings. The research presented
here and in the other papers collected in this special issue is
an important contribution to the debate and suggests a num-
ber of avenues for additional research. It is clear that further
research into stakeholders' perspectives and data-sharing
310 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
practices is required in these and other settings in low- and
middle-income countries where there is significant research
activity. In addition to further research on the views of key
stakeholders about the key requirements for good data-shar-
ing practice, there is also a need for research on the devel-
opment, implementation, and evaluation of different models
of data sharing. Research will also need to be conducted on
the development and evaluation of the key areas discussed
in the previous sections: consent, governance, policy, and
capacity building. Research which maps and quantifies the
extent and forms of emerging data-sharing practices and
assesses their impact on levels of scientific activity will be
important. Further research will also be required to map and
track public and expert opinion and experience over time.
The research areas outlined above are important for sev-
eral reasons. These include the need to establish the condi-
tions and requirements for effective and appropriate
data-sharing practices capable of commanding the trust and
confidence of relevant parties. It is also important because
many of the arguments in favor of data sharing as a promoter
of scientific progress and the production of knowledge are
empirical claims. Our research suggests that for data sharing
to be effective and sustainable, several other social and ethi-
cal requirements need to be met. This, in turn, suggests that
an effective model of data sharing will be one in which con-
sidered judgments will need to be made about how best to
achieve scientific progress, minimize risks of harm, promote
fairness and reciprocity, and build and sustain trust.
