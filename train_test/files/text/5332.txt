Introduction
The 20th century has seen the rise of international sports and
of sportive nationalism. While Mussolini and Hitler demon-
strated early how symbolic benefits can be reaped from inter-
national sport events, the so-called "politicization" of
international sports, that is, the use of sport as a vehicle for
identity politics, has heavily intensified after World War II
(Tomlinson & Young, 2006). International sport events, in
particular the Olympic Games, turned into an arena of the
Cold War after the Soviet government had decided to partici-
pate in the 1952 Olympics in order to broadcast the message
of communist superiority (Allison & Monnington, 2002). In
particular, the two Germanys (the Federal Republic of
Germany [FRG] and the German Democratic Republic
[GDR]) became involved in a fierce "Cold War on the dirt
track" (Balbier, 2005). In both parts of Germany, athletic
success was regarded as a cue for general productivity and
efficiency of the country. Furthermore, in the GDR sport
became a vehicle for increasing the legitimacy of the social-
ist regime and for creating a distinct East German national
identity (Holzweißig, 1995; Krebs, 1995).
After German reunification, however, sport was also used
as a tool to enhance national unity and solidarity in the reunited
country, for example, by giving the TV broadcast of the
Olympic Games 1992 a highly patriotic orchestration, which
was coined as "the new nationalism" of the German sports
media (Gebauer, 1996). Moreover, the staging of the FIFA
World Cup in 2006 and the associated marketing campaigns
were also used to envision a tolerant, friendly, and open-
minded nation and to foster a new self-image of the Germans,
unburdened by the shame and guilt of World War II (Kersting,
2007; Schrag, 2009). Hence, the peculiarities of its history
make Germany a very interesting case for studying sportive
nationalism. Whereas older generations were socialized in two
different states with contrasting ideologies, fiercely competing
for superiority in the field of sport, younger cohorts were
raised in a reunified country, where sport is seen as a tool to tie
the nation together. Moreover, the open display of patriotism
has recently become commonplace, at least in the realms of

Sport-Related National Pride in East
and West Germany, 1992-2008:
Persistent Differences or Trends
Toward Convergence?
Henk Erik Meier1 and Michael Mutz2
Abstract
It is commonly assumed that international sport reinforces feelings of national pride and national identity. Using large-scale
survey data from Germany, covering the period between 1992 and 2008, some unresolved key questions surrounding
sportive nationalism are addressed. We examine the relative importance of sport as a source of national pride, analyze
the sociodemographics of sportive nationalism, and describe its long-term development in East and West Germany after
reunification. Results reveal that sport is an increasingly important source of pride in Germany. Sportive nationalism is more
common among younger generations, males, and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Prevailing differences between
East and West Germany document persistent socialization effects of former sport-centered identity politics. Among East
Germans, sport is more important for general national pride, and sportive nationalism is much more equally distributed
between various social groups (with regard to age, gender, education). From 1992 to 2008, however, a trend toward
convergence between East and West Germans is also demonstrated.

sport, which is also in stark contrast to the former norm of a
reserved and dispassionate consumption of national sporting
events (Ismer, 2011).
The fact that sport has been widely used as a vehicle for
national identity politics has inspired scholars to assume that
international sport plays a key role in reinforcing feelings of
national identity and national pride (Washington & Karen,
2001). Scholars have particularly focused on effects associ-
ated with the hosting of large-scale sports events. For exam-
ple, it has been claimed that the Rugby World Cup 1995 in
South Africa fostered the nation-building process in the post-
apartheid period by transforming the South African Rugby
team, the "Springboks"--a former symbol of the apartheid
era--into an icon of the new non-racist rainbow nation
(Cornelissen, 2008; Farquharson & Marjoribanks, 2003).
Moreover, the victory of the multiethnic French soccer team
in its home World Cup in 1998 has been depicted as having
inspired national pride as well as strengthened multicultural-
ism and inclusive citizenship as elements of French national
identity (Marks, 1998). Studies on the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games (Lau, Lam, Leung, Choi, & Ransdell, 2012) and the
2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Games (Leng, Kuo, Baysa-
Pee, & Tay, 2014) also conclude that staging these events
positively impacted national pride, at least in the host city.
Most recently, the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia,
were used to create images of national strength and economic
viability (Alekseyeva, 2014; Persson & Petersson, 2014).
In addition, there exists a vibrant research on the relation
between media coverage of international sports and nation-
alism. Scholars have stressed that national stereotypes as
well as nationalism and patriotism are reinforced through
sport media (Billings et al., 2013; Blain, Boyle, & O'Donnell,
1993; Falcous & West, 2009; Garland & Rowe, 1999;
Maguire, Poulton, & Possamai, 1999). Moreover, interna-
tional sporting competitions have a salience enhancing func-
tion (Gebauer, 1996; Reicher, 2013). Media discourses
render the national category salient, because media presenta-
tion is virtually always centered around the own nation's ath-
letes and favors sports and competitions in which national
athletes are likely to perform well. Thus, broadcasts of inter-
national sport remind people permanently of their national-
ity. At least in Germany, media coverage of major sports
events seems to have shifted from a matter-of-fact style in
the 1970s toward a highly emotionalized, patriotic presenta-
tion likely to enhance the arousal and identification of TV
viewers (Ismer, 2011).
Other researchers have addressed the question of how
sporting success impact national pride. According to
Kavetsos (2012), unexpected success at the UEFA Euro 2000
was positively related to national pride. Hallmann, Breuer,
and Kühnreich (2013) concluded on the basis of a nation-
wide survey that a majority of Germans felt proud and happy
when German athletes are successful at major sport events. A
majority of Germans perceives Olympic medals indeed as
important, but by far not as important as sticking to sporting
values and the rules of fair play (Haut, Prohl, & Emrich,
2016). Moreover, studies conducted by Mutz (2013) and Von
Scheve, Beyer, Ismer, Kozlowska, and Morawetz (2014)
indicate that only individuals with a high degree of emo-
tional and symbolic involvement become more patriotic dur-
ing major football events. According to both studies,
experience of strong emotions, participation in collective
rituals, and adoption of national symbols are key factors
explaining the changes between pre-event and post-event
patriotism scores. In addition, Elling, van Hilvoorde, and
Van den Dool (2014) as well as van Hilvoorde, Elling, and
Stokvis (2010) provided evidence that the extent to which
national pride can be influenced by sporting success seems to
be rather limited and the eruptions in national pride might
only be short-lived. National pride in Germany, for instance,
increased steeply during the 2006 World Cup, but dropped at
almost the same rate after the defeat of the German team in
the semifinal (Mutz, 2013).
However, some key questions surrounding sportive
nationalism have remained unexplored. Based on the
assumption that its history turns Germany into an ideal labo-
ratory for studying the relationship between sport and
national identity, research presented here addresses some of
these questions: First, we examine the relative importance of
sportive nationalism compared with other sources of national
pride as well as its correlation with general national pride.
Second, we explore the social demographics of sportive
nationalism in Germany. Third, as our data set covers a
16-year period from 1992 to 2008, we analyze differences
between East and West Germans over time. Hence, the data
allow for descriptions of long-term trends and shifts in sport-
related national pride in both parts of Germany, beginning
only two years after its reunification.
Sports-Related Policies in the Divided
Germany
As in other domains, the division of Germany resulted--at
least initially--in different trajectories of sport policy mak-
ing. In the FRG, the sport movement struggled to recover
from its collaboration with the Nazi regime that had compro-
mised most of sport's leading figures (Daume, 1973). These
efforts for reconstruction resulted in a lasting tendency to
present West German sport as an "Olympic model student"
committed to particular high moral standards. Sport was now
framed as a domain in its own right independent from poli-
tics and economics. Accordingly, the government was sup-
posed to respect sport's autonomy and to abstain from
interventions (Krüger, 1995). Mainly due to the sporting
challenge by the GDR, these efforts to abstain from using
sport as vehicle for identity politics proved not sustainable
(Balbier, 2005).
However, sport soon became a symbol of the successful
reconstruction after the devastating defeat in World War II.
The unexpected West German win of the Football World Cup
Meier and Mutz 3
in 1954 resulted in a national euphoria giving rise to the feel-
ing of "We are somebody again" (Brüggemeier, 2004). The
East Germans had their own athletic reconstruction heroes.
Cycling world champion Gustav-Adolf "Täve" Schur
became a legend and an ultimate communist role model
when he waived his own chance for victory for a team mate
during the 1960 World Championships. Schur remained a
staunch supporter of the GDR even after its collapse and was
voted East Germany's biggest sport idol of all times in 1990
(Sajutkow & Gries, 2002).
Beyond serving as a reconstruction symbol, sport became
a vehicle for identity politics as the East Germans turned
sporting successes into a means for gaining diplomatic rec-
ognition. West German sport organizations tried to prevent
such recognition on the basis of the Hallstein Doctrine,
declaring the FRG as sole legitimate representative of
Germany. Accordingly, East German elite athletes were
turned into "diplomats in training suits" (Holzweißig, 1981)
and the two Germanys became involved in a "Cold War on
the dirt track" (Balbier, 2005). The quest for athletic domi-
nance resulted in the creation of highly sophisticated sport
systems utilizing the latest advances in exercise and training
physiology (Hunt, 2007). As a matter of fact, the East
German strategy proved to be successful as outstanding per-
formances forced international sport authorities to finally
recognize the GDR (Balbier, 2005). After the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) had become increasingly tired of
the intra-German arguments, the GDR was allowed to par-
ticipate in the Munich Games of 1972 as a sovereign state
and defeated the West German team on its home ground
(Braun & Wiese, 2005). Thanks to enormous investments in
training science, inclusive talent screening, and a clandestine
"state doping" (Franke & Berendonk, 1997), the GDR
became a sporting world power competing with the Soviets
and the United States (Dann, 1996). Although the success of
the GDR's efforts to use sport as vehicle for increasing the
legitimacy of the socialist regime and for creating a distinct
East German national identity have been controversially dis-
cussed (Andersen, 2011; Fetzer, 2003; Holzweißig, 1995;
Krebs, 1995), most scholars would admit that sporting suc-
cesses have at least somewhat improved the identification of
the GDR citizens with the socialist regime.
However, East German athletic dominance came with
consequences for West German sport as the West German
political elite perceived international sport as an important
Cold War arena as well. The political interest in athletic
achievements inspired the modernization of structures and
policies within the West German sport movement because the
federal government offered heavily increased subsidies in
exchange for efforts to improve performances (Balbier, 2005,
see also Meier & Reinold, 2013). Yet the increased politiciza-
tion of sport remained controversial in West Germany. Sport
became ideologically contested after the "New Left" adopted
a highly critical stance toward high-performance sport and
depicted sport as means of discipline and the extension of
capitalist logics into leisure time (Rigauer, 1979). Thus, sport
never occupied such a central role in West German self-repre-
sentation and identity politics.
Thus, in sport as in other domains, the division of Germany
served to create quite different institutions and policies. The
fact that reunification has placed two very different societies
under the West German regime has raised the question if and
how East German attitudes and behaviors would adapt
(Arnold, Freier, & Kroh, 2015; Bauernschuster & Rainer,
2011;Fuchs,Roller,&Weßels1997;Konietzka&Kreyenfeld,
2002; Lee, Alwin, & Tufis, 2007; Svallfors, 2010).
Research Questions
In light of these peculiarities of its history, Germany repre-
sents an ideal case for studying the long-term effects of iden-
tity politics. The division of Germany has created a unique
laboratory for examining political socialization effects of
sport-centered identity politics. Three important yet unre-
solved questions are at the core of this study:
Research Question 1: Based on the prominent role of
sport in the former GDR and the international success of
East German athletes at the international level, it can be
argued that sport constitutes an important domain for
national pride particularly among East Germans.
However, over the course of almost two decades since
reunification, it is also plausible to assume that a process
of convergence may have taken place. Hence, the impor-
tance of sport as a source of national pride in East and
West Germany will be analyzed. Particularly, the initial
differences in 1992, 2 years after reunification, and the
development of sport-related national pride in both parts
of Germany over the next 16 years will be investigated.
Research Question 2: Moreover, it has remained unclear
how sport-related national pride relates to general
national pride. Politics, the economy, science, culture,
and sport are often regarded as distinct societal domains
in which outstanding achievements may bring credit and
prestige to a nation (Evans & Kelley, 2002). Although it is
commonly assumed that general national pride may result
from domain-specific national pride, the relative weight
of each domain for general pride remains a matter of spec-
ulation. Hence, the effect of the sporting domain on gen-
eral nationalism will be assessed and compared with other
societal domains, so that the specific contribution of sport
can be grasped. Moreover, East and West Germany will
also be compared in this regard, whereby the article is
driven by the hypothesis that achievements in sport will
be more closely correlated with general national pride
among East Germans.
Research Question 3: Furthermore, little is known about
the sociodemographics of sportive nationalism. Previous
research has indicated that lower educated individuals as
well as those actively involved in sports score higher in
4 SAGE Open
sportive nationalism (Denham, 2010; Elling et al., 2014;
Hallmann et al., 2013; Haut et al., 2016). However, find-
ings on age, gender, income, and political orientation
reveal contradictory patterns. Hence, this article will ask
for sociodemographic characteristics that make it more
likely that individuals show sportive nationalism. Again,
differences between East and West Germany are
addressed. Given the significance of sport in East German
identity politics, it seems likely that sporting national
pride is less structured by sociodemographic characteris-
tics in East Germany compared with West Germany.
Method and Data
Data Source
The German General Social Survey (GGSS; GESIS--
Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 2012) is a cross-
sectional survey with a focus on attitudes, behavior, and
social structure in Germany. The GGSS has been conducted
every 2 years since 1980 and contains a large body of perma-
nent questions. Before German reunification in 1990, the
sample represented the adult population of West Germany
and West Berlin. Since 1992, the sample represents the resi-
dent adult population (>18 years) in East and West Germany.
Questions on national identity and sporting national pride
have been included in the 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2008 survey
wave; hence, our analysis relies on these four waves. Sample
sizes in these waves vary between 3,469 and 3,804 respon-
dents. In each wave, at least 1,000 persons are surveyed in
East Germany to allow for comparisons of East and West
Germans.As questions on national pride were only presented
to individuals with German citizenship, we cannot account
for sportive nationalism of non-German residents. Details on
the samples and questionnaires are provided on the website
of the German Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences
(www.gesis.org/en/allbus/) and in the GGSS technical
reports (e.g., Wasmer, Scholz, & Blohm, 2010).
Variables
Research presented here uses the GGSS measures for
domain-specific national pride and general national pride.
Furthermore, sociodemographic indicators as well as politi-
cal orientations are used as covariates in the models. These
control variables are fully described in the Appendix.
Domain-specific national pride was assessed in each wave
with questions addressing various German institutions and
achievements: (a) the German constitution ("Grundgesetz"),
(b) the German parliament ("Bundestag"), (c) achievements
of German athletes, (d) economic achievements, (e) German
art and literature, (f) scientific achievements, and (g) services
of the welfare state. Respondents were told to choose up to
three institutions or achievements, which make them proud of
Germany. Across all GGSS waves, about 75% of respondents
indicated the maximum number of three sources of pride,
15% reported to be proud of at least one or two of said institu-
tions or achievements, and another 10% spontaneously
replied not to be proud of any of the above-mentioned aspects.
Based on these data, our operational definition of sport-
related national pride is thus located on a relational level:
Compared with six other possible sources of pride, respon-
dents had to rank the achievements of athletes among the top
three to be considered sportive nationalists.
General national pride was captured with one item, "I am
proud to be a German." This wording was used in the most
recent survey of 2008. Respondents indicated their national pride
on a 5-point rating scale. As general national pride was assessed
with different items and scales in different waves, the GGSS is
unsuitable for comparisons over time in this particular case.
Results
The Importance of Sport as a Domain of
National Pride
In several GGSS waves, respondents were asked which
achievements make them feel proud of Germany. We docu-
ment the share of respondents who are proud of Germany
with regard to its achievements in the (a) athletic, (b) eco-
nomic, (c) cultural, (d) scientific, and (e) civic domain,
whereby the civic domain is measured with three items refer-
ring to constitution, parliament, and welfare state (Table 1).
Respondents in West Germany most frequently indicate that
they are proud of Germany's constitution as well as its eco-
nomic and scientific achievements. Whereas pride in the consti-
tution increased from 49% in 1992 to 62% in 2008, the
importance of economic pride has decreased significantly, from
a peak of 60% in 1992 to 49% in 2008. Science also became
more important over time with 49% of Germans reporting to be
proud of achievements in this domain in 2008. Sporting success
of German athletes is of lesser importance in West Germany.
Only a minority of 20% were proud of Germany's athletic
achievements in 1992. However, this share increased to 27% in
the latest GGSS wave. Hence, although still at a rather low level
compared with other domains, sport-related pride has become
more common in West Germany from 1992 to 2008.
Data on East Germany, however, reveal a very different
pattern. East Germans are less proud of civic achievements
like the constitution, the parliament, or the welfare system.
This may be due to their socialization under a very different
political regime. Moreover, their pride in the economy
declined sharply from 55% in 1992 to 37% in 2008, reflecting
the enduring economic decline in the East German federal
states. However, sport-related national pride is of far greater
importance for East Germans compared with West Germans,
because about one in two East Germans selected sport as a
domain for national pride. This high level of sportive nation-
alism in East Germany is in line with the socialization hypoth-
esis, which assumes a formative and thus long-lasting impact
Meier and Mutz 5
of the former GDR's identity politics. Thus, even in 2008--
18 years after reunification--the importance of sport as a
domain for national pride varies strongly between East and
West Germany. Sport is less important in West Germany,
where the economic, scientific, and civic domains appear to
be more important for national pride. In East Germany, how-
ever, sportive nationalism is far higher and positioned among
the top domains for national pride.
At second glance, however, the data also support the notion
of convergence between East and West Germany: Whereas
sportive nationalism was 2.55 times higher in East than in West
Germany in 1992 (51% vs. 20%), this ratio dropped steadily
over time, to 2.35 (1996: 54% vs. 23%), 1.91 (2000: 42% vs.
22%), and 1.70 in the 2008 survey (46% vs. 27%). Hence, dif-
ferences in sportive nationalism between East and West
Germans became smaller and may converge in the long run.
Sport-Related National Pride and General
National Pride
The last wave of 2008 included a question on general national
pride, so that the relevance of sport for general national pride
can be assessed. Accordingly, an ordinal regression model
was conducted with general national pride as the dependent
variable and domain-specific national pride scores as the pre-
dictor variables. Age, gender, and educational level of the
respondents served as control variables. The model was cal-
culated for East and West Germany separately (Table 2).
It has to be noted, however, that cross-national research
supports the idea that Germans show comparatively low lev-
els of national pride (Evans & Kelley, 2002). In the GGSS
samples, about 15% to 20% of the adult population report a
strong sense of national pride. These rather low numbers are
usually ascribed to Germany's inglorious past. In view of the
atrocities of the Nazi regime and due to the collective guilt
over these crimes, the open expression of national pride is
still considered inappropriate by many, particularly in older
generations. Hence, those who openly express a strong sense
of national pride are mostly younger people, those with right-
wing political orientations and a rather uncritical attitude
toward Germany's history.
Results reveal that sportive nationalism is a strong predic-
tor of general national pride in both parts of Germany.
Respondents who chose sport as an important domain for
national pride also indicated more general national pride.
Besides the economic sphere, sport is most closely correlated
with general national pride. At least in West Germany, civic
and scientific national pride are also positively correlated
with general national pride; however, the effects of these
domains are not as strong as for sport. In East Germany, per-
ceived achievements in the civic and scientific domains are
not significant predictors of general national pride. Pride in
artistic and cultural achievements is not substantially associ-
ated with general pride in West Germany and even nega-
tively correlated with general nationalism in East Germany.
Hence, athletic success does not only lead to sport-related
national pride but also fosters general nationalism.
Achievements in other societal domains, for example, in the
field of arts and literature, might nurture domain-specific
pride but do not increase general national pride to a notice-
able degree.
The Sociodemographics of Sportive Nationalism
in Germany
Concerning the sociodemographics, previous research sug-
gests that higher levels of sportive nationalism correlate with
a lower educational level and fewer economic resources.
Here, we analyze the sociodemographics of sportive nation-
alism with regard to age, gender, education, income level,
self-placement in the left­right political spectrum and place
of residence, that is, East versus West Germany.
Given the fact that Germany provides a "natural experi-
ment" for studying socialization effects of sport-centered
identity politics, it is of utmost interest to examine East­West
differences and changes in the sociodemographics of sportive
nationalism over time. Therefore, we tested for interactions of

the sociodemographic variables with (a) East and West
Germany and (b) with the survey year. The first set of interac-
tions accounts for differences in the sociodemographic distri-
bution of sportive nationalism among East and West Germans,
whereas the second set of interactions allows for trend analy-
ses over a 16-year period (1992-2008). Although we tested
for all possible interactions, the final logistic regression
model (Table 3) only includes those effects which turned out
as significant.
Significant main effects are found for all of the included
variables: A higher degree of sportive nationalism is a
characteristic of younger generations, males, individuals
with lower and medium educational levels, a lower income,
and for East Germans. The generation effect illustrates that
older respondents are less prone to report sportive nation-
alism than younger respondents. Respondents born in the
1970s and 1980s show significantly higher levels of sport-
ive nationalism compared with respondents born before
1950, hence compared to those socialized under the Nazi
regime and/or in the post­World War period. The gender
effect on sportive nationalism seems highly plausible:
Because sport represents a highly gendered sphere, it does
not come as a surprise that males also take more pride from
Germany's sporting success. In addition, education and
income seem to strongly influence sporting pride. Thus,
our findings support similar results from other studies,
which also documented more sporting pride among lower
status groups (Elling et al., 2014; Hallmann et al., 2013;
Haut et al., 2016). Findings thus support claims made by
Schediwy (2012) that identification with successful
German athletes becomes more attractive in times of eco-
nomic crisis, in particular among individuals with lower
social status who are economically more vulnerable. For
these individuals, identification with successful sport
teams and athletes may, at least gradually, compensate for
the loss of individual self-worth that typically results from
unemployment or precarious working conditions.
Moreover, the time variable (survey year) once more indi-
cates that sportive nationalism generally has increased in
Germany from 1992 to 2008.
These findings appear to be quite stable over time because
only one of the interaction effects with the survey year
reaches significance. Namely, the significant interaction with
East/West Germany shows that the main effect--that East
Germans feel more pride when Germany's athletes suc-
ceed--has decreased over time. Similar to a number of other
legacies of East German political socialization, differences
in sports-related pride appear to wane over time and even
may converge in the long run.
Nevertheless, the differences between East and West
Germany with regard to sportive nationalism are still
striking. Besides the markedly higher level of sport-
related national pride in East Germany, further socializa-
tion effects are indicated by the fact that sportive
nationalism in East Germany is less influenced by educa-
tion, less "gendered" and more equally distributed among
different generations. Hence, East German women and
better-educated East Germans are more likely to display
sportive nationalism than their West German counterparts.
Moreover, older East Germans show more and younger
East Germans less sports-related pride compared with
West Germans of the same generation. In addition, East
German identity politics seem to have succeeded in dis-
solving the relationship between right-wing attitudes and
sportive nationalism. Whereas in West Germany sportive
nationalism is more common among those who place
themselves further right on the left­right political contin-
uum, there is no such effect in East Germany. Hence, one
effect of the GDR's sports-centered identity politics may
be seen in the fact that sportive nationalism is much more

Discussion
Taking Germany as a crucial case, research presented here
has addressed a number of questions concerning the role and
specific contours of sportive nationalism. By analyzing a
unique longitudinal German data set consisting of four sur-
veys and covering a 16-year period, we addressed some
unresolved key questions concerning sportive nationalism
and sports-based identity politics.
Regarding the relative importance of sportive national-
ism, we were able to demonstrate that pride in athletic
achievements represents an important source of national
pride, but that other societal domains, such as economy, sci-
ence, and culture are more important. This, however, is not

true for East Germany, where pride gained from athletic
achievements is a more prevailing phenomenon. However,
pride in athletic achievements has also grown in West
Germany until 2008, which might reflect the rise of sport as
a global entertainment industry and may mirror the German
"summer tale" of 2006 where the national football team
inspired the masses at the German World Cup. Moreover,
sportive nationalism proved to be a main predictor of general
national pride. Hence, athletic success is to a greater extent
linked to the nation as a whole than achievements in science,
arts, or politics.
Furthermore, we have explored the sociodemographics
of sport-related national pride. The findings support a
number of intuitive assumptions concerning sportive
nationalism. A higher degree of sportive nationalism is
more common among younger generations, males, indi-
viduals with lower and medium educational levels, and a
lower income. These findings inspire a number of interpre-
tations. First, sportive nationalism might indeed serve self-
esteem enhancing purposes for most vulnerable social
groups. Second, the gendered character of sport has the
effect that the domain represents a far less important source
of national pride for women. Third, sport-centered identity
politics have long-lasting socialization effects. The empha-
sis on success in high-performance sport under the social-
ist regime in the former GDR has indeed resulted in higher
levels of sportive nationalism among East Germans, con-
tinuing until today. However, just like other legacies of the
socialist regime, the socialization effects of the GDR's
identity politics wane in the long run. From reunification
until 2008, a significant trend toward convergence can be
detected when it comes to the levels of sportive national-
ism in East and West Germany.
Finally, it is necessary to reflect on the limitations of
our study. While we believe that the longitudinal character
of the GGSS data serves to increase the robustness of our
findings, two major limitations have to be mentioned.
First, the forced choice format used by the GGSS is far
from optimal and should be replaced by rating scales.
Second, the exclusion of immigrants prevented us from
addressing the question how sportive nationalism figures
among ethnic minorities.
