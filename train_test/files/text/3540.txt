Introduction
Brachial blood pressure (BP) increases with exercise and
an exaggerated rise in BP during exercise has been shown
to be an independent predictor of myocardial infarction,
left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke and cardiovascular
death.1­4 It is, however, well recognized that brachial BP
can be an imperfect surrogate for the corresponding central
aortic pressure at the aortic root, due to variation in the
degree of aortic­brachial pressure amplification. To date,
the effect of exercise on central aortic pressure has received
little attention, in part due to the complexity of undertak-
ing such measurements during active exercise. Early inva-
sive studies with direct measurement of aortic pressure
demonstrated an exaggeration of pressure amplification
from the aortic root to the periphery with vigorous exer-
cise, such that the exercise-induced rise in peripheral
pressure was found to exceed the rise in central pressure.5,6
More recently these differential effects of exercise on
peripheral and central pressure have been confirmed using
non-invasive methods based on peripheral pulse wave
analysis, suggesting that the magnitude of pressure

Abstract
Introduction: Brachial blood pressure increases with exercise and an excessive rise predicts increased cardiovascular
risk. Measurement of brachial blood pressure alone may exaggerate the true blood pressure elevation due to exercise-
induced change to pressure amplification. Whether blood pressure-lowering treatment modulates pressure amplification
during exercise is unknown.
Methods: Thirty-two participants with stage 1­2 hypertension (mean age 59.2 years) received eight weeks' blood
pressure lowering with either aliskiren (300mg, n=16) or valsartan (320mg, n=16). Brachial and central aortic pressure
(CASP) were measured non-invasively during treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol) at baseline, after eight weeks' treatment
and 48 hours following treatment withdrawal.
Results: The rise in brachial blood pressure with exercise exceeded the rise in CASP, indicative of enhanced pressure
amplification. Eight weeks' treatment elicited similar reductions in brachial blood pressure and CASP which did not differ
between rest and peak exercise (p>0.05). The exercise-induced increase in systolic pressure amplification did not differ
between baseline and following eight weeks' treatment (p>0.05). These effects remained unchanged following treatment
withdrawal.
Conclusion: Blood pressure lowering does not directly influence the relationship between aortic and brachial pressure
either at rest or during exercise in patients with hypertension, other than through proportionate lowering of both
pressures. These effects remained unchanged 48 hours after a simulated missed medication dose.

amplification may depend upon the type and extent of
exercise undertaken, as well as age and other factors.7­11
Remarkably, to date no previous study has reported the
effects of BP-lowering treatment on the response of central
pressure to exercise. We recently reported in this journal data
from a study evaluating the effects of two different strategies
for therapeutic inhibition of the renin­angiotensin system
(RAS) on brachial BP during exercise. This study compared
the direct renin-inhibitor aliskiren with the angiotensin recep-
tor blocker valsartan and showed that both treatments simi-
larlyattenuatedanexercise-inducedriseinbrachialpressure.12
In that study, central aortic pressure was also recorded non-
invasively via pulse wave analysis, using tonometry (BProTM,
HealthSTATS International, Singapore) and mathematical
computation of the radial pressure wave.13 These data are pre-
sented in the current report and describes for the first time the
effects of BP-lowering therapy on the relationship between
central aortic and brachial pressures during exercise.
Patients and methods
The results presented in this paper derive from both pre-
specified and exploratory analysis of data from patients
recruited into a multicentre randomized controlled trial
(RCT) evaluating the effects of RAS blockade on bra-
chial and central aortic pressures (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT00819767) and EUDRA CT (2008-005500-10).12
Patients
Men and women aged  50 years with stage 1­2 hyperten-
sion (mean sitting systolic BP (msSBP)  140 mmHg and
< 180 mmHg, and mean sitting diastolic BP (msDBP) <
110 mmHg, measured at rest) were eligible for inclusion.
In addition, patients had to be anticipated to be able to
reach peak exercise capacity (85% of their predicted maxi-
mum heart rate) during a treadmill exercise test conducted
according to the standard Bruce protocol.
The main exclusion criteria included: secondary hyper-
tension, therapy with more than two antihypertensive
drugs, a history of severe cardiovascular or cerebrovascu-
lar disease, known Keith­Wagener grade III or IV hyper-
tensive retinopathy, and type I diabetes. Pregnant or
nursing women were also excluded. All patients provided
written informed consent before participating in any study
procedures and all study centres received approval from
the relevant local and central ethical review boards.
Study design
The study design has been reported previously12 and is
outlined below.
The study from which data were analysed was a rand-
omized, double blind, parallel-group study. After a two-week
washout and a one- to two-week placebo run-in period,
eligible patients were randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150
mg or valsartan 160 mg for one week, with forced titration to
double the initial dose for a further seven weeks (Figure 1).
Three treadmill exercise tests were conducted using the
standard Bruce protocol at: (i) baseline (immediately prior to
randomization), (ii) at the end of the active treatment period
(week 8) and (iii) 48 hours after treatment withdrawal, to
evaluate the persistence of the treatment effect two days after
treatment withdrawal (missed dose, week 8 + 2 days).
Exercise tests were conducted according to American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/
AHA)14 and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guide-
lines for exercise testing15 and patients were closely moni-
tored before, during and after the tests. Electrocardiogram
(ECG) monitoring was continuously performed during the
test to ensure patient safety and tests could be stopped if any
of several ECG criteria were met (such as severe ST-segment
depression; ST-segment elevation; frequent ventricular
extra-systoles; onset of ventricular tachycardia).
Study assessments
The main objective of this analysis was to assess the exer-
cise-induced changes in central aortic systolic pressure
(CASP) relative to the corresponding changes in standing
brachial BP after eight weeks of aliskiren or valsartan ther-
apy and following treatment withdrawal. Our primary
focus was on CASP because the measurement of pulse
pressure (brachial and central) is dependent upon accu-
rately determining true diastolic pressure, which we found
to be less reliable with manual sphygmomanometry during
exercise. The primary endpoint for this analysis was the
change in systolic pressure amplification from rest to peak
exercise, comparing baseline with end of treatment (eight
weeks). Changes in other central haemodynamic variables
during exercise were also investigated. In order to stand-
ardize exercise effort according to the Bruce protocol,
incremental treadmill exercise was maintained by each
participant until 85% predicted maximal heart rate (HR)
had been achieved (100% of predicted HR: female 200 ­
age; male 220 ­ age).
For the primary analysis, due to the limited size of the
study, baseline and treatment data for the study population
were pooled to assess the physiological effects of exercise
on brachial and central pressure parameters. This was a
reasonable approach as we had shown that both valsartan
and aliskiren had had similar effects on brachial pressure
at rest and during exercise.12 Brachial BP and CASP were
measured whilst standing at rest, at peak exercise and dur-
ing the recovery phase, prior to administering study medi-
cation. Other central haemodynamic variables, including
systolic pressure amplification ratio (calculated as bra-
chial/central BP), were also recorded.
Standing BP provided the baseline (at rest) value for the
exercise test, and was the mean of three measurements
1054 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
taken at 1­2-min intervals prior to the test. Standing BP
was also measured during exercise at the end of each 3-min
period, immediately after reaching peak exercise capacity
and during the recovery period (10, 20 and 30 min after
peak exercise; Figure 1 and Supplementary Digital Content
Figure 1 online). A mercury sphygmomanometer was used
for brachial BP measurement due to the recognized unreli-
ability of automated BP measurement during exercise.
Systolic BPwas defined according to the onset of Korotkoff
phase I sounds, whilst diastolic pressure was defined using
Korotkoff phase IV sounds.
Measurement of central aortic pressure.Central aortic
pressures were measured using the BProTM device
(HealthSTATS International, Singapore) during each
exercise test at rest, at peak exercise and during recovery
(at 10, 20 and 30 min after peak exercise). The device,
designed like a wrist watch, uses applanation tonometry to
capture radial artery waveforms, which are calibrated
to brachial BP and processed using a validated algorithm
to derive central aortic pressures.13,16 The device was
worn clamped to the wrist using a `square lock' restraint,
which allowed reliable and consistent recording of high-
fidelity radial artery waveforms during exercise testing.
At rest, waveforms were captured immediately following
the final of three brachial blood pressure measurements
(within 15 s) and calibrated to the averaged brachial
blood pressure. At peak exercise and during the recovery
period, waveforms were captured immediately following
the first brachial blood pressure measurement with the
participant temporarily stationary and with their wrist
held still at heart level. Captured waveforms were back-
calibrated to the appropriate brachial blood pressure
value. For all measurements using the BProTM device,
arterial pressure waveforms were sampled in 10-s blocks
over the course of 20­30 s and the first stable waveform
block used for data analysis. In selecting the first stable
waveform block, waveforms were visually inspected for
anomalies by an experienced operator and quality control
criteria applied to ensure adequate pulse height (100 mV)
and pulse length variability (<20%).
Statistical analyses
The study population was defined as those participants com-
pleting central and brachial blood pressure measurements
both at rest and at peak exercise. Normally distributed vari-
ables are presented as mean ± SD, non-normally distributed
data are presented as median ± interquartile range.

cally significant. Database management and statistical analy-
sis were performed using IBM SPSS for Windows version

pressure in 68 participants.12 Of these, 32 participants (16
aliskiren, 16 valsartan) completed central pressure record-
ings both at rest and at peak exercise across the eight week
treatment period. The present report describes the influ-
ence of BP lowering on brachial and central pressure dur-
ing exercise testing in these 32 participants.
Patient disposition and baseline characteristics
More than two-thirds of patients in the study were male
(68.8%) and almost all were Caucasian (96.9%). Mean age
was 59.2 years, and 34.4% of patients were obese (body
mass index (BMI)  30 kg/m2) with a mean BMI of 28.8
kg/m2 (Table 1). The baseline characteristics of the study
population were similar to those previously reported for
the entire patient population12 (n=68).
Effects of exercise on CASP and brachial BP at
baseline in the pooled population
At baseline, as expected, standing CASP was lower than
standing brachial SBP at rest (137.0±10.3 vs. 150.9±10.9
mmHg) in the pooled patient population (n=32). CASP
increased from rest to peak exercise by a mean of 30±25.5
mmHg, and then fell to below the resting level during the
recovery period (Figure 2). The changes in standing bra-
chial SBP showed a similar profile during exercise (Figure
2), although the mean increase from rest to peak exercise
(50.6±28.4 mmHg) was much greater than that for CASP
(p<0.01). Systolic pressure amplification, that is, the ratio
between CASP and brachial SBP, together with the differ-
ence between brachial and central pressures, showed a
marked elevation with peak exercise before declining to
resting values during recovery (Figure 3).
Effects of BP lowering at rest and during
exercise in the pooled population
Eight weeks' BP-lowering treatment was associated with
reductions in both brachial SBP and CASP from baseline at
rest (Figure 2). Eight weeks' treatment was also associated
with reductions in brachial SBP and CASP at peak exercise.
The extent of the treatment-induced reductions at rest and
peak exercise did not differ when compared (reduction in
brachial SBP: rest ­15.9±13.0 mmHg, peak exercise
­12.7±25.9; difference 3.2±26.5 mmHg, p=0.5; reduction
in CASP: rest ­16.1±13.5 mmHg, peak exercise ­8.9±23.3
mmHg; difference 7.1±24.6 mmHg, p=0.11). Similarly, the
extent of the increase in brachial SBP and CASP from rest
to peak exercise did not differ between baseline and after
eight weeks' treatment (brachial SBP change (rest­peak
exercise): baseline 50.6±28.4 mmHg; eight weeks' treat-
ment 53.8±21.7 mmHg, p=0.5; CASP change (rest­peak
exercise): baseline 30±25.5 mmHg; eight weeks' treatment
37.1±19.2 mmHg, p=0.11). Whilst statistical analysis
revealed no difference between the effects of treatment at
rest and peak exercise, a trend towards a lesser reduction in
CASP, however, was apparent at peak exercise relative to
rest. Similarly, a trend toward a greater increase in CASP

with achievement of peak exercise was seen following
eight weeks' treatment relative to baseline. Importantly, as
reported at baseline, the rise in brachial SBP exceeded the
rise in CASP following eight weeks' treatment.
Systolic pressure amplification and the difference
between brachial and central pressure both showed an
increase from rest to peak exercise (Figure 3). The extent
of these increases with exercise did not differ between
baseline and after eight weeks' treatment (increase in sys-
tolic amplification (rest to peak exercise) at baseline
0.11±0.09; increase in systolic amplification (rest to peak
exercise) after eight weeks' treatment 0.08±0.1; difference
0.03±0.1, p=0.08; increase in brachial minus central pres-
sure (rest to peak exercise) at baseline 20.6±13 mmHg;
increase in brachial minus central pressure (rest to peak
exercise) after eight weeks' treatment 16.7±13.2 mmHg;
difference 3.9±14.8 mmHg, p=0.15). However, consistent
with the effects of treatment on CASP relative to brachial
SBP, trends towards lesser increases in systolic amplifica-
tion and the difference between brachial and central pres-
sure were seen with exercise, following eight weeks'
treatment (Supplementary Digital Content Figure 2).
These data indicate that whilst eight weeks' treatment
reduced brachial and central BP both at rest and at peak
exercise, the pattern of change in these parameters with
exercise remained essentially unaltered. This was seen in
spite of some residual variability in the effects of treatment
on central pressure at peak exercise.
Effects of a missed medication dose on BP
lowering at rest and during exercise in the
pooled population
Forty-eight hours after a missed medication dose, brachial
and central pressures remained unaltered both at rest and at
peak exercise relative to values seen after eight weeks'
treatment (Figure 2). Similarly, the increase with exercise
in systolic pressure amplification and the difference
between brachial and central pressure remained unchanged
relative to that seen at eight weeks or baseline following a
missed medication dose (Figure 3).
Analysis of data by BP-lowering treatment type
Whilst this study was not powered to demonstrate differ-
ences in exercise haemodynamics between treatments, the
changes in brachial and central pressure during exercise
were broadly similar when the two different treatments
(aliskiren versus valsartan) were compared (Figure 4).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the influence of
BP lowering on exercise-induced change in brachial and
central blood pressure in people with hypertension. The
main findings are that the rise in central pressure from rest
to peak exercise was markedly lower than the correspond-
ing rise in brachial pressure, consistent with increased
aortic­brachial systolic pressure amplification during exer-
cise. Blood pressure lowering treatment for eight weeks
reduced both brachial and central pressures at rest and dur-
ing exercise. However, the reductions in aortic and brachial
pressures following treatment were proportionate to the
pre-treatment relationship between aortic and brachial
pressures, at all time points. These findings demonstrate for
the first time that BP-lowering treatment, at least with the
drugs tested here, does not exert a major influence on the
relationship between aortic and brachial pressure at rest and
during exercise, other than through proportionate lowering
of both pressures. Consistent with the latter, the increased
systolic pressure amplification associated with peak exer-
cise was not significantly modulated by BP-lowering treat-
ment, nor was there any significant treatment-induced

change in the difference between aortic and brachial pres-
sure at corresponding time points. If anything, there was a
trend toward a lesser reduction in central relative to bra-
chial pressure at peak exercise, together with a trend to a
smaller exercise-induced increase in systolic amplification
following eight weeks' treatment, which did not achieve
statistical significance. Finally, the beneficial influence of
treatment on brachial and central pressure during exercise
was not diminished 48 h after medication withdrawal, sim-
ulating a missed medication dose.
The exaggeration of systolic and pulse pressure ampli-
fication with exercise has been demonstrated in previous
studies using both direct5,6 and indirect7­11 measurement of
aortic pressure waveforms, together with contemporane-
ous measurement of peripheral BP. This indicates that the
true pressure excursion (i.e. central pressure) during exer-
cise is much less dramatic than the typical rise in brachial
pressure. This may be a direct consequence of functional
changes in the systemic circulation in response to the
demands of the working musculature for increased perfu-
sion, but may also serve to protect the major organs against
excessive pressure elevations during the exercise period.
The mechanism for the increase in systolic pressure
amplification during exercise has not been fully eluci-
dated. Dynamic exercise is associated with increases in
cardiac output, heart rate and sympathetic mediated vaso-
constriction and venoconstriction. In addition to the conse-
quent elevation in systemic BP in response to exercise,
stimuli within the exercising musculature mediate local-
ized vasodilatation in response to the increased metabolic
activity to maintain adequate muscle perfusion. Thus
assessment of central BP together with peripheral blood
pressure as measured over a non-working musculature, for
example, over the brachial artery in the case of treadmill
exercise, demonstrates enhanced pressure amplification
relative to the resting state.5­11 By contrast, the degree of
central to peripheral amplification has been reported to be
attenuated when peripheral pressure is measured over the
working muscle5 as a consequence of local vasodilatation
in the working limb.17,18 Similarly, the exercise-induced
enhancement in central to peripheral amplification meas-
ured over the non-working muscle has been reported to be
attenuated following initiation of local vasodilator stimuli
such as induction of reactive hyperaemia6 or application of
heat locally.19 These observations indicate that the
increased pressure amplification induced by exercise may
be modulated by local conditions and may involve changes
to pressure wave reflections in the face of an unchanged or
diminished aortic impedance. Alternatively the enhanced
amplification may result as a consequence of increased
blood flow into a vasoconstricted vasculature and may also
result in part from enhanced sensitivity of central BP to
increasing HR.20
Our observation that the enhancement in pressure ampli-
fication with exercise remained relatively unchanged
despite BP lowering is intriguing. It suggests either that in
spite of effective BP lowering, RAS blockade does not
directly affect the physiological performance of the arterial
system during exercise, or that global changes to the physi-
cal characteristics of the arterial system do not modulate
the pressure amplification response to exercise. The latter is
consistent with other studies investigating the influence of
factors such as diabetes or ageing on pressure amplifica-
tion. Thus, whilst type 2 diabetes has been associated with
exaggerated brachial and central BP responses to exercise
relative to age- and gender-matched people without diabe-
tes, no difference in systolic or pulse pressure amplification
between groups was reported either at baseline or following
exercise.21 In a study comparing the effects of exercise on
brachial and central pressure in groups of young and older
men, Casey and colleagues11 reported that whilst ageing
was associated with changes to brachial and central pres-
sure at both rest and peak exercise, there was little differ-
ence in the magnitude of the pressure amplification change

to exercise in relation to age. Similar data were reported by
Sharman and colleagues10 with regard to the influence of
age on the exercise-mediated change from baseline values
in pressure amplification. However, these workers also
reported a reduction in the extent of exercise-induced ampli-
fication in the presence of hypercholesterolaemia. This was
interpreted to indicate that exercise-induced elevations in
pressure amplification were attenuated by enhanced periph-
eral pressure wave reflections resulting from impaired
endothelial function with hypercholesterolaemia.
Our findings would not necessarily support a major role
for wave reflection. Treatment-induced reduction in wave
reflections might have been expected to minimize the
exercise-induced increase in central relative to brachial
pressure, thereby enhancing the amplification response.
Instead, we found a trend towards an attenuated exercise-
induced increase in amplification following treatment,
which is difficult to reconcile with the concept of benefi-
cial effects of treatment on wave reflections.
Our suggestion that wave reflections are unlikely to
play a major role in modulating exercise-mediated pres-
sure amplification is supported by recent work using wave
separation analysis during moderate exercise22,23 which
indicates that changes in pressure amplification with exer-
cise are independent of changes to arterial pressure wave
reflections. Similarly, other studies investigating the influ-
ence of short-term infusion with noradrenaline or inhibi-
tors of nitric oxide synthase (LNMMA) on the change in
pressure amplification during exercise8 report no change
to the exercise-induced increase in pressure amplification
with drug infusion. These data are also consistent with the
notion that exercise-induced changes to pressure amplifi-
cation are independent of global change in arterial physical
characteristics.
A key issue for the interpretation of exercise studies
using non-invasive measurements of central pressure is
whether exercise itself has any influence on the method for
deriving central pressure. Previous studies have produced
equivocal findings. Sharman and colleagues, using a com-
mercially available generalized transfer function for deriv-
ing central pressure, reported no influence of exercise on
non-invasively-derived central pressure in a small group of
patients referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterization.7
Similarly Holland and colleagues24 reported non-inva-
sively-derived central pressure to be a reproducible and
reliable technique during haemodynamic perturbations
induced by exercise. However, using a radial to carotid
transfer function, Payne and colleagues reported that exer-
cise was associated with an underestimation of transfer
function-derived carotid pressure compared with directly
measured carotid pressure, in a group of healthy men
undergoing moderate exercise.25 Other workers using a
digital to aortic transfer function generated in cardiac
patients reported that exercise modulates the characteristics
of the transfer function such that derivation of aortic
pressure became unreliable, especially at higher heart
rates.26 Importantly, however, the extent of any possible
underestimation in central systolic pressure defined in these
studies was small, that is, no more than 5mmHg, when
compared with the rise in central pressure with exercise
(circa 30mmHg in our study) and is comparable to the vari-
ability typically seen in comparisons between invasively-
measured and non-invasively-derived central pressure.
By contrast, studies using direct invasive measurement
of aortic pressure suggest little influence of exercise on
aortic waveform shape,27 or on the impedance spectrum,22
indicating that underestimation of central pressure in non-
invasive studies may be specific to use of a generalized
transfer function derived at rest. The present study used
low-pass filtering via a N-point moving average to derive
central pressure non-invasively rather than using a gener-
alized transfer function. Whilst exercise was associated
with modulation to the shape of the radial pressure wave,
whether exercise potentially modulates the degree of fil-
tering required accurately to derive central pressure is
unknown.
The persistence of BP-lowering effects following a
missed dose of BP-lowering medication, which mimics
lack of compliance to treatment, is another important treat-
ment consideration.28 For sportsmen and very active indi-
viduals, the effects of a missed dose on the changes in BP
during exercise are of particular clinical importance, given
the relationship between exercise-induced rises in SBP and
adverse clinical outcomes.1­4 The current study suggests
that the beneficial effects of BP lowering with valsartan or
aliskiren were maintained following a missed dose, even
during the stress induced by vigorous exercise. This find-
ing is consistent with data from the ASSERTIVE study,
which compared the effect of aliskiren and telmisartan on
BP after a one-week treatment withdrawal.29,30
The present study has a number of limitations, which
should be addressed. This was a small study with an
exploratory objective to investigate the influence of
RAS-blocking treatment on the exercise-induced rise in
central pressure. As such it was not powered to demon-
strate differences in central pressures or related haemo-
dynamic parameters between the two different treatments
used in the study. Similarly, the study was not powered
to investigate the response of central pressure elevation
to exercise by age, gender or height. Nevertheless, our
study was well powered to show changes in both bra-
chial and central blood pressure and amplification in
response to exercise and the data are consistent with pre-
viously published reports. However, this is the first study
to report the effects of BP-lowering treatment on exer-
cise-induced pressure amplification change. As such it
was not possible, a priori, to calculate the necessary
sample size required should a change in the amplifica-
tion response to exercise become apparent ­ especially
one that trended in the opposite direction to what many
Lacy et al. 1059
might have predicted. An indicative, retrospective power
calculation indicates that the study would have required
77 participants to demonstrate a significant decrease in
systolic pressure amplification and a sample size of 115 to
show a significant change for the difference between bra-
chial and central pressure with exercise between baseline
and end of treatment. This information will be useful for
calculating statistical power for future studies of this
kind. We focused on systolic pressure amplification
rather than pulse pressure. Although diastolic pressures
were measured at rest and during exercise, the investiga-
tors noted that the measurement of DBP by auscultation
(Korotkoff phase IV) during exercise was problematic
due to noise and movement, and less reliable than sys-
tolic pressure recordings. Moreover, other workers have
reported rhythmic variations in pulse pressure associated
with exercise, particularly upright dynamic exercise.31,32
We therefore elected to focus our data analysis on systolic
pressure. Undertaking detailed physiological studies dur-
ing exercise is complex. Despite the small numbers, our
findings clearly demonstrate that BP lowering does not
enhance exercise-mediated pressure amplification. If any-
thing there was a trend to the opposite direction, that is,
towards an attenuation in exercise-mediated amplification.
Importantly, these data were recorded within the rigorous
context of a randomized clinical trial of BP lowering.
In conclusion, this study reports for the first time that
BP lowering treatment, at least with the RAS-blocking
drugs tested here, did not directly influence the relation-
ship between aortic and brachial pressure at rest and dur-
ing exercise, other than through proportionate lowering of
both pressures. Further work is needed to better understand
the mechanisms underpinning aortic­brachial pressure
amplification during exercise.
