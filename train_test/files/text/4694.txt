Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy
that occurs in 1 in every 500 African American births
(National Institutes of Health, 2002). Clinical complications
of SCD include vaso-occlusive pain crises, anemic episodes,
infections, and stroke (Frank, Allison, & Cant, 1999; Smith,
1989). Health care utilization for children with SCD has
been well documented largely due to an increase of studies
using administrative claims data (Grosse, Boulet, Amendah,
& Oyeku, 2010). Children with SCD have mean expendi-
tures 8.8 times that of children in general (Bilenker, Weller,
Shaffer, Dover, & Anderson, 1998). Relative to children with
other chronic illnesses, children with SCD have a higher fre-
quency of hospitalizations and longer mean length of stay
(Ireys, Anderson, Shaffer, & Neff, 1997). In addition, chil-
dren with SCD have rehospitalization rates as high as 23%
(Brousseau, Owens, Mosso, Panepinto, & Steiner, 2010).
The average medical fee for a child with SCD during child-
hood (age 0-18 years) is approximately US$1,354,000 (Kauf,
Coates, Huazhi, Mody-Patel, & Hartzema, 2009).
Cumulatively, these studies indicate that despite progress in
the evaluation and management of SCD (Halasa et al., 2007;
Steinberg et al., 2003; Vichinsky, Hurst, Earles, Kleman, &
Lubin, 1988), care of affected children continues to be
high-cost and resource-intensive (Amendah, Mvundura,
Kavanagh, Sprinz, & Grosse, 2010; Leschke et al., 2012;
Mvundura, Amendah, Kavanagh, Sprinz, & Grosse, 2009;
Raphael et al., 2009; Raphael, Mei, Mueller, & Giordano,
2012; Sobota, Graham, Neufeld, & Heeney, 2012).
While the relative efficiency and low cost of claims data
have yielded new insights into health care utilization for
pediatric SCD, uncertainties remain as to whether routine
claims data may lack sufficient information to fully charac-
terize medial service use. A number of past studies have
questioned the utility of administrative claims data for
assessing health care utilization and quality given well-
documented limitations including coding errors and mis-
classifications of health care use (Iezzoni, 1997;
Newschaffer, Bush, & Penberthy, 1997; Parkinson, 2002;
Steinwachs et al., 1998). However, few studies have
focused on a single chronic condition (Pawlson, Scholle, &
Powers, 2007). While medical record review may provide
more clinical data relative to administrative claims, it is
limited particularly when records are only available from a

Abstract
Health care utilization of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been well documented due to an increase in the use of
administrative data sets. While use of such data sources is relatively efficient and low cost, questions remain as to whether
they provide sufficient information to fully characterize health care use. The aim of this study was to determine whether
administrative data have the capacity to fully assess health care utilization among children with SCD. We studied the health
care utilization of 154 low-income children with SCD in a managed care organization combining administrative data and
medical record review. In our comparison, we found that administrative claims provided key information on the scope
and location of health service use and that sole reliance on medical record review may undercount unique members and
encounters.

subset of institutions where an individual may receive care.
In the case of SCD, even when children receive care at
comprehensive sickle cell centers, they may also seek ser-
vices outside these institutions.
The overall aim of this pilot study was to determine
whether administrative data are sufficient to fully assess
health care use among children with SCD. To evaluate the
health care utilization of children with SCD who were
enrolled in a Medicaid managed care program, we compared
administrative claims data with medical record chart review.
Our specific study questions were (a) whether medical record
review supplements administrative claims data for SCD and
(b) the degree to which children with SCD concurrently
receive care at multiple institutions.
Method
Study Design
A retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive analysis was
conducted based on claims data from Texas Children's
Health Plan (TCHP) and medical record review from Texas
Children's Hospital (TCH) to assess health care utilization of
children with SCD. TCHP is a health maintenance organiza-
tion for children with public insurance and the largest pro-
vider of care for children with Medicaid and the State
Children's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) in the greater
Houston area. TCH is a large, tertiary freestanding children's
hospital in Houston, Texas. The study was approved by the
institutional review board at the Baylor College of Medicine.
Study Population
The goal of selection was to identify children with SCD who
were TCHP members and also received medical services at
TCH. SCD was identified using International Classification
of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9CM)
code 282.6 which encompasses sickle cell hemoglobinopa-
thies. Medical services were defined as emergency care
(ER), hospitalizations, hematology visits, primary care phy-
sician (PCP) visits, and radiologic imaging. The initial target
population consisted of children ages 0 to 18 years who
received health care services paid by TCHP at any time dur-
ing 2007 and had a minimum of one medical service at TCH
during the same period. We then excluded members who had
less than 10 months of contiguous enrollment within TCHP
during the calendar year, as done in a prior study (Raphael et
al., 2009). From this process, we identified 154 unique mem-
bers who comprised our study sample.
Administrative Database
The study used administrative data from TCHP for the calen-
dar year 2007 that included diagnoses and medical services.A
third-party software was used to collect demographic and
utilization data for members with SCD and migrate them to a
relational database containing chart review data. To protect
patient confidentiality, we created an interface between the
administrative claims and chart review data that permitted an
individual patient's data to be merged but which de-identified
the matched data at the time of the analysis.
We collected demographic data and medical service use.
Patient characteristics consisted of age, gender, race/ethnic-
ity, sickle cell phenotype, receipt of comprehensive care at
TCH, public insurance type, continuous enrollment months
in calendar year, and distance from TCH. Age was divided
into categories of <1 year (infant), 1 to 4 years (preschool
age), 5 to 12 years (school age), and 13 to 18 years (adoles-
cence). Racial/ethnic information was categorized as White,
Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Other. For each
patient, we determined whether they received comprehen-
sive hematology care at TCH. For the purpose of this study,
receipt of comprehensive hematology care was defined as a
minimum of one routine visit to the sickle cell center at TCH.
Public insurance was categorized as Medicaid versus SCHIP.
Continuous enrollment in the study calendar year was
grouped as 10, 11, or 12 months. Finally, for each patient, we
calculated the distance from their home to TCH by using dis-
tances between zip codes.
For medical service use, we recorded ER visits, hospital-
izations, and routine hematology visits for SCD. We also
assessed PCP encounters, both preventive visits and urgent
care visits. Finally, we recorded Transcranial Doppler
Ultrasound (TCD) screening, a recommended annual screen-
ing test for children with SCD to assess stroke risk (National
Institutes of Health, 2002).
Supplemental Medical Record Review
Using unique identifiers from TCHP administrative claims,
we matched and identified medical record numbers for
TCHP members with SCD who received care at TCH. While
TCH has the largest children's hospital in Houston, children
with SCD enrolled in TCHP have access to non-TCH institu-
tions within the city. A diagnosis of SCD from the adminis-
trative claims was verified with TCH medical records to
minimize misclassification errors. A chart review was con-
ducted to determine documentation of all health care utiliza-
tion occurring at TCH for the study period.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demo-
graphics and health care utilization. For health care utiliza-
tion, we calculated total encounters per unique member
separately for claims data and medical record review. This
ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of a given
encounter type by the total number of unique members hav-
ing that encounter. All analyses were conducted using
STATA 9.0.

Results
Patient Demographics
Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. The
mean age of patients was 5.7 years. Children ages 1 to 4
years accounted for half of all patients. African American
and Hispanic children comprised more than 80% of the
study sample. The majority of children did not receive
comprehensive care at TCH. Most children were insured
through Medicaid. Almost 70% of the study sample lived
within 20 miles of TCH.
Medical Service Utilization--Claims Versus Chart
Review
Results comparing administrative claims with chart review
data are shown in Table 2. For ER visits, the ratio of total
encounters per unique member was 2.2 for claims compared
with 1.5 for medical record review. The total encounters per
unique member ratio was also higher for claims relative to
medical record review for routine hematology visits.
Outpatient hematology care demonstrated notable patterns.
A total of 49 members generated 226 visits with hematology
according to TCHP claims data. Within TCH alone, 51
members (including 2 members not identified in claims
data) accounted for 158 visits with hematology according to
TCH chart review. For PCP visits, 154 unique members
accounted for 654 PCP visits, or 4.3 claims per person.
Health care utilization at TCH only accounted for a fraction
of these encounters. According to medical record review, 14
PCP encounters were documented among 6 unique mem-
bers, or 2.3 visits per person. Of the PCP visits, 57%
(373/654) were coded as preventive and 42% (281/654)
were coded as urgent according to claims review (data not
shown). Of 154 members, 20 did not have any office visits
with a PCP according to claims review. Of this group, 7
members had at least 1 office visit with a hematologist. For
hospitalizations, the total encounters per unique member
were lower for claims relative to medical record review. No
differences in the ratio were found for TCD screening. Only
17% (26/154) of unique members underwent TCD screen-
ing according to TCHP claims data. Only 8 of the 26 TCDs
were documented at TCH.
In addition to assessing the total encounters per unique
member, we also assessed the utilization patterns of frequent
users of medical services. For members (n = 17) who were
identified as having 3 or more ER visits, we compared the
occurrences at TCH with other institutions. Two thirds
(58/87) of ER visits occurred at TCH while the remainder
occurred at outside institutions. For members (n = 7) with 3
or more inpatient hospitalizations, approximately 70%
(19/27) of their hospitalizations occurred at TCH.
Discussion
Our pilot study provides novel data on the potential benefit
of combining administrative claims data and medical record
review to assess health care use and fragmentations in care
among children with SCD. This study demonstrates findings
consistent with past studies, documenting significant use of
medical care, inadequate access to hematology services, and
underutilization of TCD screening (Carroll, Haywood,
Fagan, & Lanzkron, 2009; Mvundura et al., 2009; Raphael
4 SAGE Open
et al., 2009; Raphael, Shetty, Liu, Mahoney, & Mueller,
2008; Shankar et al., 2005; Shankar et al., 2008). It also
shows that medical review, alone, conducted at one institu-
tion, can quite dramatically undercount unique individuals
and encounters. Chart review only showed benefit in the case
of routine hematology visits where it picked up additional 2
members (49  51) who had encounters. These claims were
potentially missed due to inaccurate coding or errors in filing
or reporting. To achieve the most complete picture of health
care utilization, claims data that cover an entire state or
region may offer the most accurate data source.
This work highlights potential fragmentations in care for
children with SCD. For high-acuity care, TCHP members
sought care at TCH and other health care institutions. While
these utilization patterns may have been driven by conve-
nience and proximity to health care services, they nonethe-
less raise concern about how children with SCD navigate the
health care system. Receipt of care in multiple environments
can be problematic for children with SCD. They may be
cared for by staff unfamiliar with their extensive histories
and diverse needs or unfamiliar with SCD in general.
Physicians may inappropriately repeat tests and interven-
tions. Such practices may have adverse consequences on
individual patient health and generate unnecessary health
care costs.
This pilot study had several methodological limitations.
Only medical records at TCH were reviewed. We did not
have access to records at other acute care institutions. This
limited our ability to verify and fully assess the nature of
encounters at all sites of acute and hematology care. It also
limited our ability to determine the exact sickle cell pheno-
type for the majority of our sample. We also did not have
access to the visit policies of the individual PCPs. These
policies could encourage or discourage fragmentation. If the
PCP advised patients in need of acute care to use geographi-
cally convenient facilities or those more closely affiliated
with their practice, it would artificially appear that fragmen-
tation of care was occurring. However, these policies may
have other benefits of convenience and proximity to PCPs
and patients. In our study sample, 31% of children lived 20
miles or farther from TCH. Use of TCH may have been espe-
cially difficult for these families.
This study demonstrates the benefits of administrative
claims data in documenting the health care utilization of chil-
dren diagnosed with SCD. Administrative claims data pro-
vides key insights into the scope of health service use,
including how and where services are being used. This study
also highlights the limitations of sole reliance on medical
record review. In the future, integration of chart review may
have a more central role (Pawlson et al., 2007). Historically,
chart review has been limited by its resource and time inten-
sive nature. However, with federal efforts to implement elec-
tronic medical records across integrated health care systems,
review of medical records may be more of a viable option in
the future.
