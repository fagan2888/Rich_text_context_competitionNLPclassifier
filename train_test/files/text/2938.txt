Research Question
By mid-2006 real estate prices in the US began to plummet, triggering the US subprime
mortgage crisis that led to a global financial crisis. German banks, too, experienced consider-
able loan losses and ensuing capital constraints. This was largely attributed to their various
exposures to the US real estate market. In addition to their direct lending to US firms in the
real estate sector and to major subprime lenders, German banks also became exposed by
providing liquidity support in the form of credit lines to their asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP) conduits. For that reason, we investigate how each type of exposure in the US influ-
enced domestic lending in Germany. We focus on the heterogeneity in the contraction taking
place across banks and firms. We are mainly interested in seeing whether  when home prices
started to decline in the US  differences in bank exposures to the US real estate market start-
ed to determine bank lending in Germany according to firm risk.
Contribution
A number of features clearly distinguish our paper from previous work. First, having access
to unique and confidential supervisory data, we know the actual time-varying exposures to
the US real estate market (including direct lending to the US real estate sector and to the sub-
prime lenders, and the indirect conduit exposure) of all German banks which, combined with
the steep drop in US home prices, allows us to identify possible bank losses. Second, to iden-
tify the changes in lending we rely on credit register data that covers the entire banking sector
in Germany. Finally, we examine not only the resultant aggregate volume but also the com-
position of bank lending in Germany across corporations, industries and regions.
Results
We first document the overall contraction in lending in Germany following the US home
price shock. We find that banks with a higher exposure to the US real estate market contract
their lending to German firms by more than banks that do not have such an exposure. The re-
duction in lending is more pronounced for borrowers in riskier industries and regions follow-
ing a decrease in US home prices. When breaking down our estimations by type of exposure,
we also find that this effect is driven by the direct exposure to the real estate sector and by the
conduit exposure. In sum, we in effect document that possible losses abroad shift bank lend-
ing at home and that the size of this effect depends on the type and the degree of exposure the
bank has.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Als Mitte 2006 die Immobilienpreise in den USA zu stürzen begannen, wurde die Subprime-
Krise in den USA ausgelöst, die zu einer globalen Finanzkrise geführt hat. Auch deutsche
Banken erlebten erhebliche Kreditausfälle und mussten die daraus resultierenden Kapitalein-
bußen verkraften. Dies war im Wesentlichen auf ihre verschiedenen Engagements am US-
Immobilienmarkt zurückzuführen. Neben ihrer direkten Kreditvergabe an die US-Firmen im
Immobiliensektor und an die wichtigsten Subprime-Kreditgeber wurden die deutschen Ban-
ken auch durch die Bereitstellung von Liquiditätshilfen in Form von Kreditlinien, um ihre au-
ßerbilanziellen Geschäftseinheiten zu unterstützen, dem US-Hauspreisschock ausgesetzt. Aus
diesem Grund untersuchen wir, wie jede Art der US-Engagements deutscher Banken die in-
ländische Kreditvergabe in Deutschland beeinflusst hat. Wir untersuchen vor allem die Hete-
rogenität bei dem Rückgang der inländischen Kreditvergabe. Uns interessiert primär die Fra-
ge, ob ­ als die Immobilienpreise in den USA zu sinken begannen ­ die inländische Kredit-
vergabe der Banken durch die Unterschiede in ihren Engagements in dem US-
Immobilienmarkt und in Abhängigkeit vom Unternehmensrisiko in Deutschland beeinflusst
wurde.
Beitrag
Eine Reihe von Eigenschaften unterscheidet unser Papier eindeutig von früheren Arbeiten.
Erstens ermöglicht uns der Zugang zu vertraulichen bankaufsichtlichen Einzeldaten die tat-
sächlichen zeitlich variierenden Engagements in dem US-Immobilienmarkt aller deutschen
Banken zu bestimmen. In Kombination mit dem drastischen Rückgang der US-
Immobilienpreise ermöglicht uns diese Information, die mutmaßlichen Verluste der Banken
zu identifizieren. Zweitens greifen wir auf das Kreditregister zu, das den gesamten Banken-
sektor in Deutschland abdeckt, um die Änderungen in der Kreditvergabe zu untersuchen.
Schließlich untersuchen wir nicht nur das resultierende Volumen im Aggregat, sondern auch
die Zusammensetzung der Kreditvergabe der Banken in Deutschland über Unternehmen,
Branchen und Regionen.
Ergebnisse
Wir dokumentieren zunächst den generellen Rückgang der Kreditvergabe in Deutschland
nach dem US-Hauspreisschock. Wir finden, dass die Banken mit einer höheren Kreditvergabe
an den US-Immobilienmarkt ihre Kreditvergabe an deutsche Firmen stärker nach dem Rück-
gang der US-Immobilienpreise reduziert haben als die Banken, die keine derartige Kredit-
vergabe an den US-Immobilienmarkt hatten. Der Rückgang der Kreditvergabe nach dem US-
Hauspreisschock ist auch stärker bei deutschen Firmen in riskanteren Branchen und Regio-
nen. Die Schätzergebnisse nach der Art der US-Engagements zeigen, dass diese Ergebnisse
überwiegend durch die direkte Kreditvergabe an den US-Immobiliensektor und durch die
Conduit-Engagements getrieben sind. Wir dokumentieren somit vor allem, dass mutmaßliche
Verluste im Ausland die Kreditvergabe der Banken zu Hause verlagern,während die Größe
des Effekts von der Art und dem Grad der Risikoposition der Bank abhängt.

Abstract
We investigate how differential exposures by German banks to the US real estate market during the
recent financial crisis affect their corporate lending in Germany. Using unique bank-level exposure da-
ta, we distinguish between three different types of bank exposures, i.e. direct exposure to the US real
estate sector, direct exposure to subprime lenders in the US, and indirect exposure through the liquidi-
ty provided to ABCP conduits. We find that banks with a higher exposure to the US real estate sector
and to conduits cut their lending to German firms by more following a decrease in US home prices
than banks that do not have such an exposure. Moreover, these banks then also shift their lending to
industry­region combinations with lower insolvency ratios. Hence possible losses abroad shift bank
lending at home, and the size of this effect depends on the type and the degree of exposure the bank
has.

1 Introduction
By mid-2006 real estate prices in the US began to plummet, triggering the US subprime mort-
gage crisis that led to a global financial crisis. While the main focus was on the fragility of the fi-
nancial system (and, to some extent, the regulatory focus is still on how to re-establish a healthy
banking industry), the initial policy reaction relied mostly on monetary tools. These measures
proved to be not entirely effective due to the presence of excessive household debt coupled with de-
creasing house prices. The crisis may not have been as severe, it is often argued now, if those un-
derlying problems had have been addressed in a first and foremost step (Mian and Sufi (2014)).
German banks, too, experienced considerable loan losses and ensuing capital constraints. This
was largely attributed to their various exposures to the US real estate market. In addition to their di-
rect lending to US firms in the real estate sector and to major subprime lenders, German banks also
became exposed by providing liquidity support in the form of credit lines to their asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP) conduits.
The first banks that had to be bailed out by a government during the financial crisis were actual-
ly two German banks, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and Sachsen Landesbank. The deteriorating
quality of their assets and the panic on the ABCP market forced these German banks to write off the
liquidity lines they had provided to their ABCP conduits. These write-offs resulted in considerable
losses on their balance sheets. In general, the Landesbanks' substantial exposures to US mortgage-
backed securities through their ABCP conduits, which were higher than those of the large German
banks, led to the collapse or bail-out of various Landesbanks.
Given these differences, we therefore investigate how each type of exposure in the US influ-
enced domestic lending in Germany. We first suitably document the overall contraction in lending
that occurred in Germany, then focus on the heterogeneity in the contraction taking place across
banks and firms. We are mainly interested in seeing whether  when home prices started to decline
2
in the US  differences in bank exposures to the US real estate market started to determine bank
lending in Germany according to firm risk.
We are clearly not the first to study (and for identification purposes `exploit') the international
transmission of shocks through the banking sector. Our research follows the seminal work by Peek
and Rosengren (1997) and Peek and Rosengren (2000) who show that when parent banks are faced
with a (funding) shock, this can negatively affect lending by their foreign affiliates.1 In particular
Peek and Rosengren (1997) identify a supply shock to bank lending in the US through US branches
of Japanese banks, which was caused by the decline in Japanese stock market values. Unlike the
previous studies trying to examine the relationship between capital ratios and the overall volume of
lending, their study actually disentangles loan supply from loan demand by focusing on the trans-
mission of the capital effects of the Japanese stock market declines. Their paper documents that the
Japanese banks' capital ratios significantly determine its commercial and industrial lending in the
US. Using similar data, Peek and Rosengren (2000) investigate the change in commercial real estate
loans in spatially separated markets, which enables them to examine the impact of this loan supply
shock on the real economic activity in the US.
A recent paper (and closest to ours) is a paper by Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011). They investi-
gate the impact of the financial crises on the credit supply of German savings banks. Here, the
transmission occurs through savings banks' holdings in Landesbanks that were exposed to subprime
mortgages.2 This mechanism is somewhat different from the one in Peek and Rosengren since an
external financial shock is transmitted to a domestic market through the exposure of the domestic
banks. For that reason, it becomes even more important and potentially more difficult to isolate the
loan supply effect. Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011) disentangle supply from demand effects by
employing information coming from the loan application process. The authors find that affected
1
Recent research confirms that, during the global financial crisis, global banks transmitted shocks across borders through their local affil-
iates (see, among others, Cetorelli and Goldberg (2011); Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012); Acharya, Afonso and Kovner (2013);
Albertazzi and Bottero (2013); Claessens and van Horen (2013); Cull and Martinez Peria (2013); Ongena, Peydró and van Horen
(2013); Allen, Hryckiewicz, Kowalewski and Tümer-Alkan (2014); Bertay (2014); and de Haas and van Lelyveld (2014)).

Other papers studying the international transmission through the asset side of the banks include De Haas and Van Horen (2013) and
Popov and Van Horen (2013). The former paper examines syndicated loans and finds that crisis-related write-downs negatively affect-
ed cross-border bank lending. The latter paper finds that large holdings of impaired sovereign debt negatively affected bank lending
during the European sovereign debt crisis. Cuñat, Cvijanovic' and Yuan (2013) study the domestic transmission of real estate price
shocks within the US using bank balance sheets.

savings banks reject more loan applications than non-affected banks. However, close bank-firm re-
lationships help to mitigate the loan supply shock.
A number of features clearly distinguish our paper from Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011). First,
having access to unique and confidential supervisory data, we know the actual time-varying expo-
sures to the US real estate market (direct lending to the US real estate sector, to major subprime
lenders, and conduit exposures) of all German banks. Combined with the US home price shock,
these exposures to the US real estate market allow us to identify possible (but at the time not yet
publicly observable) bank losses. In contrast, Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011) rely on ex post pub-
licly reported distress at three Landesbanks which reduced the value of equity held by savings
banks present in their loan data set. Thus our data set allows us to assess the time-varying effects of
various types of German bank exposures to the US real estate market throughout the entire crisis pe-
riod, not just the presumed (though plausible) impact through indirect linkages within parts of the
German banking system.
Second, to identify the changes in lending we rely on credit register data that cover the entire
banking sector in Germany, not just savings banks. We match this data with bank and market char-
acteristics. Finally, we examine the resultant changes not only in the aggregate volume but also in
the composition of bank lending in Germany across corporations, industries and regions as we want
to investigate whether there is a `flight to quality' in lending in Germany for those banks that were
more exposed to the US real estate market.3
In terms of credit volume we find that banks that had a direct exposure to the US real estate sec-
tor contracted their lending in Germany by more following a decrease in US home prices than banks
that did not have such exposure. This effect is both statistically significant and economically rele-
vant. For example, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a
decrease by 5 index points (which is equal to two standard deviations) in the S&P/Case-Shiller US
3
In this respect, our paper also contributes to an extant literature that examines the flight to quality or loan strictness following negative
shocks affecting banks (Lang and Nakamura (1995); Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1996); Murfin (2012); Becker and Ivashina
(2014)), or documents bank risk-taking following expansionary monetary shocks (Ioannidou, Ongena and Peydró (2014); Jiménez,
Ongena, Peydró and Saurina (2014)). See also e.g. for the US (Altunbas, Gambacorta and Marquez-Ibañez (2014); Delis, Hasan and
Mylonidis (2011); Paligorova and Santos (2012); Dell`Ariccia, Laeven and Suarez (2013); Buch, Eickmeier and Prieto (2014b); Buch,
Eickmeier and Prieto (2014a)), Austria (Gaggl and Valderrama (2010)), Colombia (López, Tenjo and Zárate (2010a), López, Tenjo and
Zárate (2010b)), the Czech Republic (Gersl, Jakubík, Kowalczyk, Ongena and Peydró (2015)), Portugal (Bonfim and Soares (2013)),
and Sweden (Apel and Claussen (2012)).

National Home Price Index, is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.1 per-
centage points more than a bank with no such exposure. This is a large effect given that the mean
(median) quarterly loan growth during the sample period equals -2.0 (-1.0) percent). And a bank
with 1 billion in US conduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.0 per-
centage points more than banks without conduits in place following a decrease by 5 index points in
home prices.
In terms of credit composition, we find clear evidence of a flight to quality. For example, a bank
with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a decrease by 5 index points in
the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, is estimated to contract its quarterly lending
in Germany to firms in riskier industry­region combinations (i.e. those with a 1 percentage point
higher insolvency rate) by 3.3 percentage points more than a bank with no such exposure. A bank
with 1 billion in US conduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending to such riskier industry­
region pairs by 2.4 percentage points more than banks without conduits in place when US home
prices decrease by 5 index points. Overall, these findings imply that possible losses abroad may not
only cut but also shift bank lending at home, but that the size of this effect may depend on the type
of exposure the bank has.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss the various expo-
sures German banks have in the US and their lending to firms in Germany. In Section III we de-
scribe the data and the definition of the variables of interest. We discuss the methodology and pre-
sent the main estimation results in Section IV. Section V concludes.
2 Exposures in the US and Lending in Germany
2.1 Bank Exposure to Real Estate, Subprime and Conduits
2.1.1 The Three Types of Exposures
German banks were engaged in at least three ways in the US real estate market: some banks had
direct (regular) exposures to the US real estate sector on their balance sheets, some banks had expo-
5
sures to subprime lenders, and some banks had asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits in
place.
Table 1 gives a detailed overview of German banks' portfolios based on the credit register data
by distinguishing between on and off-balance sheet exposures in 2007. The upper panel of the table
provides the regional distribution of exposures to the real estate sector, including Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain, offshore centers, the US and all foreign countries.4 We can clearly see that German
banks' exposure to US firms in the real estate sector was significantly higher than exposures to any
of the other countries' firms in the same sector. Whereas US real estate exposure exceeds 30 bil-
lion, the second highest exposure, which is to offshore centers, totals only 13.6 billion, while the
third highest, which is to Spain, equals 10.6 billion. Moreover, US real estate exposure was poten-
tially the first to be struck by a collapse in home prices and this exposure will therefore experience
the "cleanest" (identifiable) shock to real estate during the crisis.
Table 1 also breaks down the exposures by three types, i.e. on and off-balance sheet exposures
and derivatives. The fraction of the on-balance sheet exposures ranges from 87 to 92 percent for all
three types of exposures, which explains our later approach of focusing on these on-balance sheet
exposures. The rest of the table lists the outstanding loans to US banks (157 billion) and the total
exposure to offshore centers (148 billion). It is not surprising that the structure of lending to banks
differs from the direct exposure to the real estate sector as the former consists of similar shares of
on and off-balance sheet exposures due to a higher share of derivatives.
The bulk of the German banks' engagement in the US subprime mortgage market took place
through the investment activities of their ABCP conduits, however.5 For the mean bank among the
1,547 banks in our sample, direct real estate exposure in 2007Q2, for example, was equal to 17.7
million, exposure to major subprime lenders to 1.3 million, and conduit exposure to 81.3 million
(Table 2). But only a few banks had such exposures. Among the 41 banks with real estate expo-
sures, the mean (median) exposure amounted to 666.8 (161.8) million; for the 78 banks with sub-
4
During the eurozone crisis, Greece, Ireland and Portugal received bail-out funds of 148.6, 54.9 and 61.4 billion, respectively. An-
other eurozone member, Spain, experienced problems in the real estate sector reflected in decreasing house prices. Finally, exposure to
offshore centers is an indication of SPV exposures.

Since the credit register does not contain exposures to ABCP conduits, we do not include the information on those exposures in Table
1. The data on ABCP conduits comes from Moody's ABCP Query and is discussed in Table 2.
6
prime exposures, the mean (median) exposure was equal to 25 (5) million; while for the 13 banks
with conduits, the mean (median) exposure was equal to 9.7 (5.7) billion.
2.1.2 The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits
ABCP conduits set up by German banks performed maturity transformation by purchasing long-
term assets and issuing asset-backed commercial paper, a short term debt instrument which is often
used to raise capital. The ABCP were primarily sold to money market funds (MMFs) and rolled
over at regular intervals. Nevertheless ABCP conduits used to be off-balance sheet vehicles and
represented the agents of the "shadow banking" market which appeared to be less regulated. There-
fore, German banks could hold assets in their ABCP conduits without providing a sufficient amount
of the required capital.
7
8
ABCP conduits were designed to protect investors from declines in the market value of the un-
derlying assets. Sponsoring banks provided liquidity support to their ABCP conduits. According to
Moody's (2007): "Most programmes have 100% committed liquidity support that can be drawn to
repay ABCP up to the par value of non-defaulted assets, regardless of market value." In cases
where ABCP conduits experienced difficulties, credit risk attributed to the ABCP conduits effec-
tively put a strain on their parent banks.
Being a safe haven for investors before the crisis, ABCP conduits played a central role in the fi-
nancial crisis 2007-2009 when news about the deteriorating quality of US subprime mortgages
roiled the financial markets and the market for ABCP froze with risk-averse investors being unwill-
ing to purchase and roll over maturing ABCP (Acharya and Schnabl (2010); Kacperczyk and
Schnabl (2010)).6
Between August 2007 and the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008, the ABCP
market was seriously stressed. In this period, the total value of ABCP outstanding decreased by 37
percent, from $1.18 trillion to $745 billion. However, the cost of issuing overnight ABCP relative to
the US Federal Reserve Funds rate also jumped from 10 to 150 basis points after the news of the
withdrawals from BNP Paribas. On 16 September 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund ­ a large MMF
­ announced considerable losses on its holdings of Lehman Brothers' CP. This in turn triggered a
run on the MMF industry and led to the reduction of holdings of all types of CP by MMFs. After
Lehman Brothers' collapse, German banks, which were already weakened by the need to meet their
obligations on maturing ABCP, came under further pressure.
2.2 Lending to Domestic Firms in Germany
Credit growth in Germany has been characterized by various fluctuations since 2002. The annual
growth rate of lending to domestic firms rose sharply from -0.1 percent in May 2007 to 3.8 percent
in July 2008, whereas a remarkable drop was observed starting from the third quarter of 2008
6
On 31 July, 2007, the news about the bankruptcy of the two Bear Stearns' hedge funds invested in subprime mortgages reached the
market. On 7 August 2007, the French Bank BNP Paribas pronounced its withdrawals from its three funds due to an inability to judge
the "fair" value of their holdings.
9
(Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, 9/2009). The annual growth in lending declined by 2.7
percentage points to 1.1 percent between July 2008 and July 2009. The rest of the euro area, on the
other hand, witnessed a sharper decline in lending than Germany, and also at an earlier point in time
­ at the end of 2007.
The slowdown in lending is found to be situated in the non-financial industry. Growth in lending
declined sharply especially for those banking groups that were hit particularly hard by the global fi-
nancial crisis.
3 Data and Methodology
3.1 Data Sources
We employ a unique matched firm-bank level dataset that contains quarterly information from
the 1st quarter of 2005 to the 4th quarter of 2009. The data combine five databases, i.e. the credit
register (MiMik), Moody's ABCP Query, bank balance sheet data (Bista, BAKIS), regional firm in-
solvencies per industry and home price indices (S&P/Case-Shiller). These data sources make it pos-
sible to observe the individual lending behavior of German banks to domestic firms, and to combine
this information with the exposure of German banks to the real estate sector in the US, to subprime
lenders in the US, and to their conduits in the US, as well as to use the firm and bank-specific in-
formation.
The Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register (MiMik) is the main data source for the individual
exposures of German banks to firms.7 The credit register contains information on large exposures of
1.5 million (formerly 3 million Deutsche Mark) and above.8 Therefore, exposures to small and
medium-sized firms might be underrepresented in this database. However, if the sum of the expo-
sures to firms in a borrower unit exceeds the threshold of 1.5 million, the individual exposure to a
7
Details on the credit register can be found in Schmieder (2006), and in published work by Schertler, Buch and Westernhagen (2006),
Hayden, Porath and Westernhagen (2007) and Ongena, Tümer-Alkan and von Westernhagen (2012), for example. The Bundesbank al-
so maintains a website with working papers based on its credit register.
8
For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If exposures of 1.5 million or above
existed during the reporting period but are partly or fully repaid, the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. We take
the actual amounts of the exposures into consideration.
10
firm in that borrower unit is reported, even if it is a small exposure. This reporting partly abates the
extant bias in the credit register towards medium and large-sized firms.
Bank exposures to firms in the credit register are defined fairly broadly, e.g. they include not on-
ly corporate loans but also corporate bonds.9 In the credit register we are able to distinguish between
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.10 We choose to use only on-balance sheet positions,
since the inclusion of off-balance sheet exposures leads to an overstatement of the actual exposures
due to guarantees provided by banks to the other banks.
Based on individual bank exposures to firms, banks and other financial institutions, the credit
register covers both domestic and foreign exposures and contains the information on country code
and industry classification within a particular country. This structure of the credit register allows us
to identify both individual bank exposures to the real estate sector as well as to the top subprime
lenders in the US, and enables us to study the impact of these exposures on the lending of German
banks to domestic firms. However, although the credit register contains some information on firm
quality before the 1st quarter of 2008, we augment the available information with the industry-level
number of firm defaults within particular German Federal States from the Federal Statistical Office.
This information on the industry number of firm defaults allows us to differentiate between the
lending behavior of German banks towards firms with a worse and a higher quality.
The second database we use is the Moody's ABCP Query. From this database we take the in-
formation on all important conduits of German banks and on the amount of liquidity provision of
German banks to their conduits. However, this information is available in the Moody's ABCP Que-
ry only starting in 2007. For 2005 and 2006 we hand-collect this information from two Moody's
publications: "A Performance Overview for EMEA ABCP conduits" and "A Program Review for
US conduits". This information allows us to study the impact of the German bank exposure to their
conduits on lending behavior to domestic firms. Similar to the real estate exposure in the US and
9
For a more detailed definition of the bank exposures, see Section 19 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). The following
items are deemed not to be bank exposures: shares in other enterprises and securities in the trading portfolio.
10
For example, lease receivables, mortgage loans, publicly guaranteed loans, and inter-bank loans (with a residual maturity of up to one
year) are listed separately under on-balance sheet activities. Off-balance sheet items include derivatives (other than written option posi-
tions), guarantees assumed to cover these and other off-balance sheet transactions (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998).
11
exposure to the subprime lenders in the US (taken from the credit register), the German bank expo-
sure to their conduits is quarterly and is aggregated at the bank level.
We borrow the majority of our bank-specific variables from the monthly balance sheet statistics
(Bista) and some of our bank-specific variables from BAKIS. BAKIS is the Information System,
which is shared between the Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin (the German Federal Banking Super-
visory Office). It contains the bank balance sheets for all German banks. We select the monthly bal-
ance sheet statistics and match them with the credit register on a quarterly basis. Some risk indica-
tors, such as e.g. non-performing loans, are not available in Bista and we extract them on a yearly
basis from BAKIS.
Finally, to capture the price developments in the US real estate market, we access the S&P/Case-
Shiller Home Price Indices.
3.2 Measuring Bank Exposures to Financial Shocks in the US
When measuring bank exposures to financial shocks in the US, we differentiate between direct
and indirect bank exposures. Direct exposures are taken from the credit register and appear talis
qualis on banks' balance sheets. Under indirect exposure, we consider the amount of liquidity that
German banks provided to their conduits before and in the aftermath of the US crisis. These expo-
sures are considered to be off-balance sheet and thus do not directly appear on banks' balance
sheets in the event that banks' conduits run into trouble.
More precisely, we define the three different bank exposures in the US as follows: Log US Real
Estate Exposureit
is the logarithm of the total exposure of bank i in a particular quarter t to the US
real estate sector11. This information is taken directly from the credit register. US Real Estate Expo-
sureit
is accumulated across individual bank-firm level exposures to the US real estate sector (and
therefore varies at the bank level but does not vary across firms borrowing from the same bank
when we assess the changes in lending at the bank-firm level).
11
We take the logarithm of the exposure plus one in order to incoporate those banks which do not have any exposure to the US real es-
tate sector. For those banks we take the logarithm of zero plus one. We use the same approach for the other exposures as well.
12
We also define Log US Subprime Exposureit
as the logarithm of the total exposure of bank i in a
particular quarter t to the subprime lenders in the US. Again this information is taken directly from
the credit register. We gathered information on the top 25 subprime lenders in the US which experi-
enced difficulties during the US mortgage crisis. However, the German banks have been exposed to
18 of these top subprime lenders.12 US Subprime Exposureit
is accumulated across the individual
exposures to subprime lenders in the US and therefore varies only by bank.
Finally, we define the Log Conduit Exposureit
as the logarithm of the total amount of liquidity
provided by bank i in a particular quarter t to its ABCP conduits. The information on the liquidity
lines is taken from Moody's ABCP Query. Log Conduit Exposureit
is accumulated across individual
exposures to ABCP conduits and therefore varies again only by bank. The definition and measure-
ment of bank exposures to financial shocks in the US is summarized in Table 3.
Table 4 provides the descriptive statistics on the US real estate, subprime and conduit exposures
across the dataset we employ. We have almost 4.7 million bank-firm-quarter observations of differ-
ent bank exposures in the US to help us identify their impact on lending of German banks to domes-
tic firms. Not all banks in our sample have been exposed to shocks in the US. For those banks for
which we cannot find reliable direct or indirect exposures to shocks in the US, we assume that their
exposure to those shocks is equal to zero. This is a reasonable assumption given the exhaustive
character of our data sources.13
Table 4 again reflects that important German banks had considerable direct exposure to the US
real estate sector. On average, US real estate exposure for banks in our sample equals 442 million
with the 90th percentile value exceeding 1.6 billion. Subprime exposure, in comparison, does not
carry so much weight and equals on average 36 million with the standard deviation of 124 mil-
lion. Table 4 clearly shows that the magnitude of the conduit exposure ­ which is off-balance sheet
­ is of a quite different magnitude compared to direct US real estate exposure. The average for the
12
The 18 top subprime lenders have been identified in the credit register as borrower units. In total, 123 enterprises in the credit register
belong to those 18 top subprime lenders.
13
The coverage of conduit exposures prior to 2007Q1 is very sketchy because rating agencies did not cover them as few observers antic-
ipated bank lines of credit would be provided in their rescue.
13

banks in our sample is around 1.9 billion and the standard deviation reaches 5.3 billion which is a
very large number indeed.14
3.3 Assessing Domestic Bank-Firm Lending In Germany
Our model explains the quarterly change in lending, representing the first difference of the loga-
rithm of domestic lending:
(1)
where Domestic Lendingijt
represents exposure of bank i to firm j in Germany in a particular
quarter t.
If the exposures were fully repaid during the quarter, zero values are reported at the end of the
quarter in the dataset. However, in our analysis we capture only non-zero exposures and therefore
predominately focus on continuing changes in domestic lending, i.e. the "internal margin".
Table 4 shows that, in total, we have around 3.9 million bank-firm-quarter observations to assess
domestic lending by banks to firms. On average, domestic bank-firm lending in our sample is
around 3.6 million. We note that average domestic lending in our sample appears to be much low-
er compared to the average US real estate exposure, the average subprime exposure and the average
conduit exposure. This is the case because large banks in particular have such exposures.
Table 5 compares the number of observations for banks with and without exposures to the real
estate sector, subprime or conduits. These sub-samples are not mutually exclusive. The sub-sample
of banks with real estate exposure has over 1.4 million bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic
lending. The average bank-firm level amount of domestic lending in this sub-sample equals 6 mil-
lion and is somewhat larger than average domestic lending for the total sample. It should be men-
14
We acknowledge the fact that only a small number of banks were exposed as presented in Table 2. However, these banks are also the
lenders to a higher number of borrowers compared to the rest of the banking industry with no exposures. This is observable in the
number of observations of the exposed group to the total number as ranging from 25 to 35 percent (Table 5). In other words, these
banks have an important role in overall domestic lending.

tioned that banks with conduit exposures belong to the same sub-sample. However, a couple of
banks have subprime exposures although they do not have real estate exposures.
The sub-sample of banks with subprime exposure provides us with 926,000 bank-firm-quarter
observations of domestic lending. The average domestic lending for this sub-sample amounts to
5.7 million. Also a number of banks do have direct exposure to the US real estate sector and pro-
vide liquidity to conduits although they do not offer loans to subprime lenders.
We note that the number of banks that provide liquidity to conduits is significantly smaller com-
pared to the sub-samples discussed before. The sub-sample of banks with conduit exposure provides
us with only around 426,000 bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic lending. Similar to the
sub-samples with direct exposure to the real estate sector and the one with subprime exposure, the
average for domestic lending in this sub-sample, at 5.9 million, tends to be larger than the average
for the total sample.
3.4 Sample
Over the time period from the 1st quarter of 2005 to the 4th quarter of 2009 we consider 2,031
banks that provide domestic balance-sheet loans to 336,990 firms in Germany. In total we have 3.9
million bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic on-balance-sheet lending. However, a number
of bank mergers took place during this time period. We carry out a merger correction procedure by
creating a new separate bank after the merger.15 Of the 2,031 banks involved, 90 banks have direct
exposure to the US real estate sector, 142 banks have direct exposure to subprime lenders and 20
banks have conduit exposure.
In a final step we match the datasets discussed in Section III. A., and we end up with 2,030,417
bank-firm-quarter credit exposures. Table 6 contains their summary statistics that imply (when
comparing to Table 4) that selection is fortunately minimal. It is also worth noting that the change
in log domestic lending has negative mean and median values: -0.02 and -0.01, respectively.
15
Our approach is based on separating the pre-merger banks from the merged bank. In the end, we have three banks, which are treated
independently from each other. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger takes place. Each time a newly merged bank receives a
new identification number, we drop the target banks in that year (or quarter).

4 Explaining Domestic Bank-Firm Lending in Germany
4.1 Specifications
In Table 7 we run the growth in domestic bank lending in Germany on different types of expo-
sures, starting with total US exposure (total exposure to the US real estate market), followed by a
classification of our main variables of interest; US real estate exposure, US subprime exposure and
conduit exposure, and various interactions that are introduced in different models, for the sample
that consists of the 2,030,417 bank-firm-quarter credit exposures.
We are particularly interested in the interaction of the exposures with: (1) the change in US
home prices to gauge the impact of this incoming shock on the volume of bank lending, on the one
hand; and with (2) the change in US home prices and insolvency to gauge the impact of the incom-
ing shock on the composition of bank lending, on the other hand.
We estimate different forms of the following specification:

where log Domestic Lendingijt
is the growth of domestic lending (measured as the quarter-on-

sure by German banks in the US, we distinguish between Total US Exposureit-1
, US Real Estate Ex-
posureit-1
, Subprime Exposureit-1
and Conduit Exposureit-1
. US Homepricest
is the change in US
home prices while Insolvencyjt-1
defines the firm insolvency rate at the industry-region level. The
bank controls we feature are size (log of total assets), capital and liquidity ratios, ROA, and NPL.16
16
All bank variables are quarterly except ROA and NPL. These two variables are only available on a yearly basis.
20
All specifications include comprehensive sets of bank and also firm fixed effects (i
and 
j
).17 ijt
is the error term.
We employ sets of three specifications for each exposure type, always starting with a simple
model without any interactions, a second model with the interaction of exposure and US home pric-
es, and a third model with the double and triple interactions with insolvency.
Each third specification, and also the final one which includes the triple interaction term, can
help answer one of our main research questions: "Is there a flight to quality in bank lending in Ger-
many when home prices in the US decline, and does the strength of this effect depend on the degree
of the German bank's exposure to real estate, subprime and conduits in the US?
4.2 Control Variables
We start by discussing the estimated coefficients on the control variables, after which we turn to
the coefficients of main interest on the double and triple interaction terms that include exposures.
Among bank control variables, all estimated coefficients except liquidity are statistically signifi-
cant throughout. Representative estimates in this regard from Model 1, for example, are for log size
-0.00256***, for capital -0.25015*** and for NPL 0.06257***, respectively.18 These estimates im-
ply that a one standard deviation increase in the logarithm of total assets decreases the growth in
lending by 0.6 percentage points (= 2.23 × -0.00256 × 100), that a one standard deviation increase
in capital decreases the growth in lending by 0.9 percentage points (= 0.0350 × -0.25015 × 100),
and that a one standard deviation increase in NPL increases it by 0.2 percentage points (= 0.0356 ×
0.06527 × 100). For comparison, the mean growth of domestic loans across all bank-firm-quarter
observations equals -2.5 percent.
17
Because we are mainly interested in the effect of bank-level exposures over time, including bank-time fixed effects is problematic. Be-
cause few firms in Germany rely on multiple banks that are differentiated by their exposures in the US, including firm-time fixed ef-
fects equally robs the estimations of most if not all of their relevant variation. In further unreported robustness exercises we also inves-
tigate whether the effects are differentiated across bank type and across time periods but we do not find statistically significant differ-
ences.
18
*** Significant at 1 percent, ** significant at 5 percent, and * significant at 10 percent. For convenience we will also indicate the sig-
nificance levels of the estimates that are mentioned further on in the text.
21
22
23
Next we discuss the estimated coefficients on the variables the exposures will be interacted with,
i.e. the variable that captures the change in US home prices and the variable Insolvency. The coeffi-
cient for the change in US home prices is negative and significant in all models ranging between -
0.09740*** and -0.1695***, and equal to -0.09701*** in the last specification. This latter estimate
implies that a 5 index point decrease in US home prices (which is the largest drop that is observed
but one that occurs in more than one quarter of the observations) increases the growth in domestic
lending by 0.5 percentage points (= 0.05 × 0.09701) in the last model that controls for all exposures.
These estimates suggest that a substitution effect may be taking place whereby home price de-
clines in the US per se may lead to more lending in Germany overall. Although the magnitude of
this effect is not that large, our estimates of coefficients on the double and triple interactions with
this variable presented below may gain further credence as this substitution effect (as we will see) is
overturned when banks have exposures in the US.
With respect to the insolvency ratio of the borrower's region and industry, it decreases the
growth in lending as expected. The coefficient is negative in all but one specification, but it is statis-
tically insignificant.
The interaction term of the change in US home prices and insolvency appears to have an inverse
relationship with the change in lending. This implies that the substitution effect may be dominating
the tendency for "flight to quality".
4.3 Main Effects of Exposures
Let us now turn to the exposures and their interactions. Before investigating the three types that
are directly related to the origins of the crisis, we estimate our model with the total exposure to the
US real estate market that is the sum of the three types. We observe in the first three models in Ta-
ble 7 that an increase in total US exposure decreases growth in domestic lending. In Model 1 the es-
timated coefficient equals -0.00038***. As the lower panel in Table 7 (which details the economic
relevancy assessment calculations) indicates, this estimate implies that a bank with a 1 billion total
24
exposure to the US is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 0.8 percentage
points more than a bank with no such exposure.19 Its interaction with changes in US home prices
(0.00829**) implies an additional difference of 0.9 percentage points following a decrease by 5 in-
dex points in the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. This is our first main finding:
German bank exposure to the US real estate market, and the possible losses emanating there as real
estate prices in the US sagged, substantially contracted bank lending in Germany. A direct link in
terms of credit volume.
Next, in Model 3 we introduce insolvency as a measure of ex ante credit risk at the industry­
region level. The interactions of insolvency with the aforementioned terms are of main interest. The
estimated coefficient on the double interaction term of exposure and insolvency equals -0.01717,
while the estimated coefficient on the triple interaction term of exposure, US home prices and in-
solvency equals 1.86401***. The triple interaction implies that, following a decrease by 5 index
points in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate market contracts
its quarterly lending to firms in Germany in riskier industry­region combinations (i.e. those with a 1
percentage point higher insolvency rate) by an additional 1.9 percentage points more than a bank
with no such exposure. This is our second main finding: German bank exposure to the US real es-
tate market overall and the possible losses emanating there as real estate prices in the US sagged,
substantially shifted bank lending in Germany. A direct link in terms of credit composition, and
clear evidence for a flight to quality.
4.3.1 Real Estate
Total US exposure is defined as the sum of the exposures to the US real estate market and con-
sists of direct lending to the real estate sector and the subprime lenders, and the indirect conduit ex-
posure. However, we would also like to focus on each particular type of exposure that is linked to
different aspects of the problems in the real estate sector in the US. Therefore it is of great interest
19
To assess economic relevancy, we rely on the amounts of 1 billion for total US exposure, real estate and conduit exposures and 100
million for subprime exposure. This choice ensures ease and clarity of exposition, but it also broadly respects the absolute and relative
order of magnitudes of the standard deviations and means of the exposure variables (see Table 6). The standard deviation on real estate
exposure equals 1 billion and on subprime 116 million. On conduits, the standard deviation equals 4.5 billion, while its mean equals
1.5 billion.
25
to examine a direct exposure to the US real estate sector in order to have a cleaner measure. We first
observe in Models 4, 5 and 6 in Table 7 that US real estate exposure per se does not explain much
of the changes in domestic lending, but that its interaction with US home prices in Model 5 strongly
does. In the latter model, the estimated coefficient on the interaction equals 0.01078***. This esti-
mate implies that a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a de-
crease by 5 index points in the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, is estimated to
contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.1 percentage points more than a bank with no such
exposure.20 This effect is slightly larger than the estimated coefficient in the previous set of exercis-
es with total US exposure.
The coefficient on the double interaction term of exposure and insolvency has a larger magni-
tude (-0.05522), however it is imprecisely estimated. The coefficient on the triple interaction term
of exposure, US home prices and insolvency equals 3.19112**. Following a decrease by 5 index
points in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to US real estate is estimated to con-
tract its quarterly lending in Germany to riskier firms by an additional 3.3 percentage points more
than a bank with no such exposure. This is clearly a larger economic effect compared to the one
found for total exposure to the US real estate market suggesting that the direct link in terms of credit
composition exists and may comprise a large part of the exposure effect.
4.3.2 Subprime
In Models 7 to 9 in Table 7 we replace real estate with subprime exposure (which, as mentioned
previously, is to subprime lenders and distinct from real estate exposure). All relevant estimated co-
efficients are imprecisely estimated probably due to the smaller amounts of exposures involved and
the fact that fewer banks have such exposures.
Yet, the signs of most coefficients are as expected. For example, the estimates in Model 9 imply
that a bank with a 100 million exposure to subprime lenders, and following a decrease by 5 index
points in US home prices, contracts its quarterly lending in Germany by 0.6 percentage points over-
all, and to riskier firms by 0.6 percentage points more than a bank with no such exposure.
20
Notice that for more than half the sample observations, the German banks involved have zero real estate exposure in the US, marking
these banks to be at once a relevant and ideal control group.
26
Hence once more credit volume and composition in Germany are affected by the possible losses
that emanate from exposures combined with home price declines in the US.
4.3.3 Conduits
Finally, in Models 10 to 12 in Table 7 we introduce conduit exposure. This exposure is very
large. Indeed, the liquidity potentially provided to conduits is three times as high as US real estate
exposure on average, and much larger than the amount lent to subprime lenders in our sample.
However, we do not find evidence to argue that conduit exposure itself has an impact on lending in
Germany. Yet the estimates in Model 11 show that a contraction in domestic lending is again
spurred by US home prices dropping. A bank with a 1 billion exposure cuts lending by 1.0 per-
centage points more following a decrease by 5 index points in US home prices than a bank with ze-
ro exposure.21
Finally, in Model 12 the estimated additional coefficients further imply that a bank with 1 bil-
lion in US conduits contracts its quarterly lending to riskier firms in Germany by 1.4 percentage
points more than banks without conduits in place, with the additional home price effect resulting in
a contraction of 2.4 percentage points.
In sum, credit volume and composition in Germany are affected by the possible losses that ema-
nate from exposures, combined with US home price declines, on real estate, subprime and conduits
in the US.
4.4 Robustness
Our identification strategy relies on bank and bank-time level variation in exposures in the US,
coupled with firm fixed effects that account for firm-level demand in Germany. Due to the lack of
multiplicity in relationships, i.e. few German firms engage multiple banks, including firm-quarter
fixed effects removes all the variation we are interested in. However, to account for time varying
firm-level demand, we generate "firm-size times year" fixed effects. We proxy firm size with the
21
Conduits may not have entirely been invested in real estate or at all. For example, "credit arbitrage" ABCP conduits invested heavily
in securitized assets, such as asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages and commercial mortgages, and were consequent-
ly more exposed to subprime US residential mortgage loans than other types of conduits. Other ABCP conduits, such as "multi-seller"
or "single-seller" conduits, had primarily funded unsecured receivables by the time the financial crisis arrived. It is currently impossi-
ble for us to distinguish between the different types of assets present in the conduits.
27
sum of total bank borrowing at firm level, and use the distribution of this variable to generate ten
different percentile dummies. For each size percentile we then generate a set of year-specific fixed
effects.
The results remain mainly unaffected for total exposure to the US real estate market in terms of
the level and the double interactions whereas we lose significance for the triple interaction and
overall for direct real estate exposures. We have to note that when including firm size-year fixed ef-
fects, all bank controls are imprecisely estimated as well.
However, we do observe a much stronger effect for conduit exposure. Conduit exposure itself
actually leads to a contraction in lending in Germany. This finding likely results from the sudden
realization at the onset of the financial crisis that conduits "could come crashing back on the banks'
balance sheets" (actually optimal given potential reputational losses in, e.g. Segura (2014)), and
banks taking appropriate action in terms of lending in Germany.
The estimated coefficient of -0.00171*** in Model 4 implies that a bank with 1 billion in US
conduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 3.5 percentage points more
than banks without conduits in place. The double and triple interactions point to the same direction
with magnitudes of three to five times higher than previously estimated. For instance, in the final
model, the coefficient for the triple interaction of 8.19237* implies that, following a decrease by 5
index points in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to conduits is estimated to con-
tract its quarterly lending in Germany to riskier firms by an additional 8.3 percentage points more
than a bank with no such exposure. Finally, in Model 5 we include all three exposures at once and
find the results are mostly confirmed.
28

5 Conclusion
Motivated by the seminal works of Peek and Rosengren (1997) and Peek and Rosengren (2000),
we study the international transmission of shocks through the German banking sector during the re-
cent turmoil. In particular, using unique German bank exposure data, we investigate how exposures
to the US real estate market influenced domestic lending in Germany. We are interested in total
bank exposure to the US real estate market and its three salient components: direct exposures to the
US real estate sector and to the subprime lenders in the US, and indirect exposure as liquidity pro-
vided to ABCP conduits.
Confirming previous studies on the transmission of shocks, we first document the overall con-
traction in lending in Germany following the home price shock. Our main aim is, however, to ex-
plore the heterogeneity in the contraction across banks and firms. In other words, we investigate
whether differences in bank exposures to the US determine domestic lending in Germany when
home prices started to decline in the US, and whether there is a `flight to quality' in lending for
those banks that were more exposed to the US real estate market.
We indeed find that banks with higher total exposure to the US real estate market and, in par-
ticular, with higher exposure to the US real estate sector and to conduits contract their lending to
German firms more following a decrease in US home prices than banks with no such exposure.
Moreover, these banks also prefer lending to industry­region combinations with lower insolvency
ratios, especially following a decrease in US home prices. To sum up, we mainly document that
possible losses abroad shift bank lending at home whereas the size of the effect depends on the type
and the degree of exposure the bank has.
