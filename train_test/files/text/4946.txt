Republican States Bolstered Their Health
Insurance Rate Review Programs Using
Incentives From the Affordable Care Act

Abstract
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included financial and regulatory incentives and goals for states to bolster their health
insurance rate review programs, increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements, expand Medicaid, and establish state-
based exchanges. We grouped states by political party control and compared their reactions across these policy goals. To
identify changes in states' rate review programs and anticipated loss ratio requirements in the individual and small group
markets since the ACA's enactment, we conducted legal research and contacted each state's insurance regulator. We
linked rate review program changes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) criteria for an effective rate
review program. We found, of states that did not meet CMS's criteria when the ACA was enacted, most made changes
to meet those criteria, including Republican-controlled states, which generally oppose the ACA. This finding is likely the
result of the relatively low administrative burden associated with reviewing health insurance rates and the fact that doing so
prevents federal intervention in rate review. However, Republican-controlled states were less likely than non-Republican-
controlled states to increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements to align with the federal retrospective medical loss
ratio requirement, expand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges, because of their general opposition to the ACA.
We conclude that federal incentives for states to strengthen their health insurance rate review programs were more effective
than the incentives for states to adopt other insurance-related policy goals of the ACA.

Original Research
Introduction
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) sought to increase access to
more affordable health insurance through a number of provi-
sions. It expanded Medicaid eligibility and provided pre-
mium tax credits to households with incomes between 100%
and 400% of the federal poverty level that purchased insur-
ance within the ACA's newly established health insurance
exchanges (or marketplaces). These provisions increased
access to insurance; however, that access is unaffordable to
many individuals and small employers because of rising
health insurance premiums.1
To try to reduce the health insurance premium growth,
some stakeholders wanted the ACA to give the federal gov-
ernment the authority to reject proposed health insurance rate
increases determined to be unreasonable. But in the end, poli-
cymakers compromised by including incentives to strengthen
states' health insurance rate review programs and by estab-
lishing a federal medical loss ratio requirement. Since the
ACA's enactment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) has made annual and ad hoc evaluations to
determine whether each state's rate review program is
effective.2-5 CMS bases its determination on whether the state
(1) receives sufficient data and documentation to determine
the reasonableness of the proposed rate increase (whereby the
rate is the unit price of insurance, and the premium is based
on the rate coupled with the benefit design and allowable rat-
ing factors, such as age, geography, family composition, and
tobacco use); (2) conducts a timely review that considers
changes in factors such as medical cost, utilization, benefits,
and cost sharing; and (3) bases its determination of the rea-
sonableness of rate increases on a standard that is set forth in

state statute or regulation.6 Beginning September 1, 2011, in
the individual and small group markets, non-grandfathered
health insurance annualized rate increases of 10% or more
must either be reviewed by the state or CMS for reasonable-
ness. States with an effective rate review program conduct the
review and make this determination, but CMS plays this role
for states with ineffective rate review programs. The ACA
allocated $250 million for states to bolster their rate review
programs, including helping states to establish effective pro-
grams. The grants have been used by 44 states to hire and
contract with actuaries, upgrade information systems, and
enhance rate transparency.7,8
In addition to incentivizing states to impede unreasonable
premium rate increases, the ACA encourages states to play a
role in expanding insurance coverage. A number of studies
have examined the factors that led states to decide whether to
expand Medicaid or establish a state-based exchange.9-13
Politics loomed large in both decisions. Beland, Rocco, and
Waddan found that Medicaid expansion and state-based
exchange decisions required institutional coordination
between the federal and state governments, further compli-
cated by the fact that most states needed both the governor's
and legislature's approval.9 Jones and colleagues describe
how several Republican-controlled states, which were ini-
tially receptive to establishing state-based exchanges, acqui-
esced in the face of intense political pressure to oppose the
ACA in general.10
However, politics was not the only factor in state decision
making. Although Democratically controlled states were
more likely to expand Medicaid than Republican-controlled
states, economic circumstances, previous Medicaid expan-
sion, and administrative capacity all played a role in states'
decisions to expand Medicaid.11 Haeder and Weimer discuss
the influence of state insurance commissioners and existing
administrative capacity within states that established state-
based exchanges.12
To our knowledge, however, no studies have examined
which states, by political party control, decided to establish
an effective rate review program and create an anticipated
loss ratio requirement that is consistent with the federal ret-
rospective medical loss ratio requirement. In the remainder
of this article, we first examine CMS's determinations of the
effectiveness of each state's rate review program over time
and highlight the states that took actions to become effective.
Second, we report the share of states, by political party con-
trol, that made changes to become effective rate review pro-
grams, increased their anticipated loss ratio requirement to
align with the federal medical loss ratio requirement,
expanded Medicaid, and established a state-based exchange.
We statistically test whether these 4 decisions differed by
state political party control. Our hypothesis is that although
Republican-controlled states generally oppose the ACA as a
whole and chose to not emulate the federal medical loss
ratio, not expand Medicaid, nor establish a state-based
exchange, they would nonetheless establish effective rate
review programs at a similar rate to non-Republican-con-
trolled states, because reviewing rates has a relatively low
administrative burden and doing so would prevent federal
review of their carriers' rates.
Data and Methods
Whereas several studies have documented states' rate review
and anticipated loss ratio laws at a point in time,14-21 we are
the first to document changes over time between 2010 and
2013. Our sources included statutes, regulations, and insur-
ance department bulletins. We also examined states' cycle I
and II grant applications "Grants to States for Health Insurance
Premium Review" submitted to CMS, states' medical loss
ratio waiver applications submitted to the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the studies refer-
enced above. After completing this legal research, we con-
tacted state legislative librarians to review our findings. We
then contacted the state agency that regulated health insur-
ance to review our findings and to better understand their rate
review programs. We received a full response from 47 state
regulators and the District of Columbia, and a partial response
from three state regulators, and thus relied on in-state health
insurance experts to confirm our findings.
Since the enactment of the ACA, CMS has continually
determined the effectiveness of each state's rate review pro-
gram (using the criteria discussed in the Introduction), and
has published its determinations as of the following dates:
July 1, 2011,2 February 16, 2012,3 May 3, 2013,4 and April
16, 2014.5 We classified each state into one of the following
categories:
·
· Always Had Effective Rate Review Program: States
that CMS determined to have effective rate review
programs for all major types of carriers (ie, for-profit
insurers, non-profits, and health maintenance organi-
zations [HMOs]) for each of its reviews, and based on
our analysis, had already met CMS's effectiveness
criteria when the ACA was enacted.
·
· Effective Rate Review Program via Changes: States
that made changes to rate review statutes or regula-
tions after the ACA was enacted to become effective
rate review programs. Many of these states did not
receive an "ineffective" determination from CMS,
because the change was made prior to CMS's first
determination, effective July 1, 2011. We identified
these states by linking their statutory and regulatory
rate review changes to CMS's effectiveness criteria,
to determine which states met CMS's effectiveness
criteria as a result of the changes.
·
· Ineffective Rate Review Program: States that had an
ineffective rate review program as of April 16, 2014.
Prior to the ACA, many states established an anticipated
loss ratio requirement within a law, regulation, or bulletin for
Fulton et al 3
the individual and small group markets.20 The state loss
ratios were strictly based on the share of premiums repre-
sented by medical claims,22 whereas the federal medical loss
ratio allows for quality improvement adjustments as well as
tax, license, and regulatory fee adjustments, reducing the tra-
ditionally defined state loss ratio by a few percentage points.
Therefore, we assumed that a 75% state loss ratio require-
ment was equivalent to the 80% federal medical loss ratio
requirement. In the individual market, DHHS granted 7 of
the 17 states that applied for temporary relief to lower the
federal medical loss ratio threshold to between 65% and 75%
for 2011 and 2012; however, each of these states had an 80%
requirement by 2013.23 Based on our research, 23 states in
the individual market and 13 states in the small group market
already had anticipated loss ratio requirements for their
major types of carriers when the ACA was enacted; however,
only 3 states in the individual market and 5 states in the small
group market had a requirement of at least 75%. Hence, we
examined whether the remaining states and the District of
Columbia established or increased their anticipated loss ratio
requirement to be at least 75% by December 31, 2013.
Although the ACA did not have an explicit financial incen-
tive for states to establish an anticipated loss ratio that is con-
sistent with the federal medical loss ratio, increasing carriers'
loss ratios was a goal of the ACA. This goal creates an
implicit incentive, because a state does not want to determine
a rate increase to be reasonable and then systematically have
carriers' medical loss ratios exceed the 80% federal medical
loss ratio threshold.
For Medicaid expansion and state-based exchange deci-
sions, we relied on secondary sources. Twenty-seven states
and the District of Columbia (or 55%) expanded Medicaid as
of August 28, 2014.24 Eighteen states and the District of
Columbia (or 37%) established state-based exchanges as of
October 1, 2013, the beginning of the first open enrollment
period.25,26 Mississippi and Utah only established their
exchanges in the small group market. Furthermore, Nevada,
New Mexico, and Oregon have subsequently decided to have
a federally supported state-based exchange in which they
rely on the federal Web site and information technology;
however, we based our analysis on their October 1, 2013,
statuses.27
We classified states' political party control as of January
31, 2011, as follows: Republican or Democratic if the
Republican Party or Democratic Party, respectively, con-
trolled both houses and the governor's office.28 Otherwise
states were considered divided.
We used a Fisher exact test to test whether the percentage
of states that adopted these 4 policy goals differed by politi-
cal party control. We used this test because the decision was
binary and the expected frequency of particular cells was less
than 5.29 We used a McNemar exact test to test whether
Republican-controlled states adopted these 4 policies at dif-
ferent rates, because the data were generated from the same
sample of states, the decision was binary, and the expected
frequency of particular cells was less than 5. This test
included only the sub-sample of Republican-controlled states
that had not adopted the policies being compared prior to the
ACA. Results were considered statistically significant if the
P value was less than .05 using a 2-tailed test.
Results
Status of the Effectiveness of States' Health
Insurance Rate Review Programs
Figures 1 and 2 show the effectiveness status of each state's
rate review program in the individual and small group mar-
kets, respectively, from July 1, 2011, toApril 16, 2014. These
maps show that 37 states in the individual market and 27
states in the small group market that CMS determined to
have effective rate review programs for each of its reviews,
and based on our analysis, had already met CMS's effective-
ness criteria when the ACA was enacted. However, as we
discuss below, altogether, 9 states in the individual market
and 19 states in the small group market responded to the
CMS incentive and became effective rate review programs.
Four states in the individual market and 13 states in the
small group market took actions after the ACA was enacted
that enabled them to have effective rate review programs by
September 1, 2011, the date for which CMS or the state
would review rate increases of 10% or more (see "Effective
Rate Review Program via Changes" states with two or three
asterisks in Figures 1 and 2). For example, Georgia had only
an "informational only" filing requirement for most rate
revisions in the individual and small group markets. In 2011,
Georgia amended Rule Chapter 120-2-98 to require indem-
nity plans, preferred provider organizations, and Blue Cross
Blue Shield plans to file rate increases of 10% or more, so
that the state could review the reasonableness of those
increases.
Meanwhile, 5 states in the individual market and 6 states
in the small group market, which CMS initially determined
to have ineffective rate review programs, took action after
the September 1, 2011, deadline to become effective (see
"Effective Rate Review Program via Changes" states with no
asterisks in Figures 1 and 2). For example, although
Pennsylvania had prior approval authority over all carrier
types in the individual market as well as HMOs and non-
profit carriers in the small group market, it had no rate filing
requirements for for-profit insurers in the small group mar-
ket, and thus, was considered ineffective.2 However, in late
2011, Pennsylvania enacted Act 134 to give it prior approval
authority over those insurers, enabling it to become an effec-
tive rate review program.3
Finally, 5 states in both the individual and small group
markets currently have an ineffective rate review program.
This includes both Oklahoma and Texas, which had effective
rate review programs in 2011, but decided to not comply
with reviewing certain federal rate review requirements.

Comparison of States' Reactions to the
Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Policy
Goals
Figures 3 and 4 show states' reactions to the ACA's health
insurance policy goals in the individual and small group mar-
kets, respectively. The figures include a set of 4 bars each for
Republican-controlled states, politically divided states, and
Democratically controlled states. For each set, the first bar
shows the percentage of states that did not meet the require-
ments of an effective rate review program when the ACA
was enacted, but became effective since its enactment. The
second bar shows the percentage of states that had an antici-
pated loss ratio requirement below 75% (including those
states with no requirement) when the ACA was enacted, but
established or increased their loss ratio requirement to this
threshold or higher after its enactment. The third and fourth
bars show the percentage of states that expanded Medicaid
and established a state-based exchange, respectively.
Figure 3 shows states' reactions to the 4 health insurance
policy goals in the individual market. Republican-controlled
states were moderately--but not statistically--less likely
than non-Republican-controlled states to establish an effec-
tive rate review program (50.0% vs 83.3%, P = .301) and
establish or increase their anticipated loss ratio requirement to
be at least 75% (10.0% vs 25.0%, P = .271). However,
Republican-controlled states were statistically less likely than
non-Republican-controlled states to expand Medicaid (23.8%

vs 76.7%, P < .001) and establish a state-based exchange
(4.8% vs 53.3%, P < .001). Within Republican-controlled
states, we compared the rate of establishing an effective rate
review program with their rates of adopting the other 3 policy
areas. (Only the 8 Republican states that did not already have
an effective rate review program in place when the ACA was
enacted were eligible to be included in these McNemar tests.
The test with the anticipated loss ratio requirement to be at
least 75% was not applicable, because none of the 8 states
established or increased its anticipated loss ratio requirement
to be at least 75%. For state-level detail on decisions in these
4 policy areas, see Table A1 in the appendix.) We found that
these states were less likely to adopt the other policy areas,
but the differences were not statistically different: establish-
ing or increasing their anticipated loss ratio requirement to be
at least 75% (50.0% vs 0.0%, P = not applicable), expanding
Medicaid (50.0% vs 12.5%, P = .250), or establishing a state-
based exchange (50.0% vs 12.5%, P = .250).
Figure 4 shows states' reactions to the 4 health insurance
policy goals in the small group market. Republican-controlled
states were moderately--but not statistically--less likely than
non-Republican-controlled states to establish an effective rate
review program (69.2% vs 90.9%, P = .327). However,
Republican-controlled states were statistically less likely than
non-Republican-controlled states to establish or increase their
anticipated loss ratio requirement to be at least 75% (5.3% vs
33.3%, P = .031), expand Medicaid (23.8% vs 76.7%, P <
.001), and establish a state-based exchange (9.5% vs 56.7%, P
= .001). Within Republican-controlled states, we compared
their rate of establishing an effective rate review program with
their rates of adopting the other 3 policy areas (Only the 13
Republican states that did not already have an effective rate
review program in place when the ACA was enacted were eli-
gible to be included in these McNemar tests. For the test with
the anticipated loss ratio requirement to be at least 75%, only
12 of these states were included because one state already had
an anticipated loss ratio requirement of at least 75% when the
ACAwas enacted. For the Medicaid expansion and state-based
exchange tests, all 13 states were included. For state-level
detail on decisions in these 4 policy areas, see Table A1 in the
appendix.) We found that these states were less likely to adopt
the other policy areas and the differences were statistically sig-
nificant: establishing or increasing their anticipated loss ratio
requirement to be at least 75% (66.7% vs 8.3%, P = .016),
expanding Medicaid (69.2% vs 23.1%, P = .031), or establish-
ing a state-based exchange (69.2% vs 7.7%, P = .008).
For example, South Carolina, a Republican-controlled
state that neither expanded Medicaid nor established a state-
based exchange, had prior approval authority over some
types of plans in the small group market, but no filing
requirement for most insurers, non-profit carriers, and
HMOs. On June 29, 2011, it issued Bulletin 2011-03, giving
itself prior approval authority over those carriers' rates,
effective September 1, 2011. This change enabled the state to
become an effective rate review program.2
Discussion
The ACA included financial and regulatory incentives and
goals for states to bolster their health insurance rate review
programs, increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements,
expand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges. Both
Republican-controlled and non-Republican-controlled states
established effective rate review programs at a high rate: For
Republican-controlled states, the rates were 50% and 69% in
the individual and small group markets, respectively, and for
non-Republican-controlled states, the rates were 83% and
91% in the individual and small group markets, respectively.
However, Republican-controlled states were less likely than
non-Republican-controlled states to establish or increase
anticipated loss ratio requirement to be at least 75% (only in
the small group market), expand Medicaid, and establish a
state-based exchange. Particularly in the small group market,
Republican-controlled states were more likely to establish an
effective rate review program than to establish or increase
their anticipated loss ratio requirement to be consistent with
the federal retrospective medical loss ratio requirement,
expand Medicaid, or establish a state-based exchange.
The ACA's attempt to strengthen states' health insurance
rate review programs is reminiscent of the ACA's Medicaid
expansion. Under both policies, the federal government set
minimum standards and provided financial incentives for
states to pursue a federalist policy goal.
There is a notable difference, however. For rate review pro-
grams, the ACA created a clear federal role for non-compliant
states. Specifically, CMS reviews non-grandfathered carriers'
rate increases of 10% or more in the individual and small
group markets in states with ineffective rate review programs.
This incentivized states, including Republican-controlled
states that generally oppose the ACA, to establish effective
rate review programs. For example, in April 2011, Idaho's
Republican governor issued Executive Order No. 2011-03
ordering executive agencies to not implement the ACA; how-
ever, in August 2011, the Idaho Department of Insurance
received a waiver to begin conducting rate review in compli-
ance with theACA, in part, "to help preserve state oversight of
rates."30 In contrast, there was no federal intervention for
states that did not expand Medicaid, because the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that hinging all federal Medicaid funding on a
state's decision to expand Medicaid was overly coercive.31
Although most Republican-controlled states bolstered
their rate review programs to become effective, in part, to
prevent federal review of their carriers' rate increases, only
5% of all Republican-controlled states in the individual mar-
ket and only 10% of all Republican-controlled states in the
small group market established state-based exchanges to
avoid the federally facilitated exchange. Establishing a state-
based exchange, because of its visibility, could be construed
as a tacit endorsement of the ACA. In fact, the American
Legislative Exchange Council advocated for states to not
establish state-based exchanges as a way to oppose the
Fulton et al 7
ACA.32 Furthermore, the administrative burden to establish a
state-based exchange is significant. DHHS grants totaled
over $4 billion for states to establish state-based exchanges,
16-fold more than the $250 million in grants for states to
bolster their rate review programs.7,8,25 This administrative
burden has a greater impact on Republican states, which are
more likely to have lower capacity state governments.33
This study has 3 primary limitations. The small sample
size of 50 states and the District of Columbia limits our
power to detect statistical differences, potentially resulting in
not rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a substantive
difference. Notwithstanding the small sample size, we were
able to detect important statistical differences.
Second, we do not incorporate how states reviewed health
insurance rates sold through associations. Prior to the ACA,
states often regulated associations' rates in the large group
market, or had less stringent requirements if they regulated
them in the individual and small group markets.34,35 However,
as of November 1, 2011, associations are subject to rate
review regulations under the individual and small group
markets.36 Therefore, a few states with effective rate review
programs were considered to be ineffective in reviewing
associations' rates.4
Third, most states made decisions and changes related to
rate review, loss ratios, Medicaid expansion, and state-based
exchanges in 2011 and 2012. We classified states' political
party control as of January 31, 2011 to incorporate the
November 2010 elections. Only Louisiana and Mississippi
changed political party control in 2012, both from divided
control to Republican control. In a few states, a policy change
occurred in 2010, 2013, or 2014 under a different political
party control than 2011; however, these rare events did not
affect our main findings.
Conclusion
In principle, federalism combines state policy innovation and
administration with federal financing and minimum stan-
dards, all of which are present in the ACA.37-39 The ACA
sought to increase access to more affordable health insurance.
It provided financial and regulatory incentives and goals for
states to establish effective health insurance rate review pro-
grams, emulate the federal retrospective medical loss ratio
requirement, expand Medicaid, and establish health insurance
exchanges. Although the federalist goal for states to establish
effective rate review programs was largely accomplished,
including within Republican-controlled states, these states
generally did not emulate the federal retrospective medical
loss ratio requirement, expand Medicaid, or establish state-
based exchanges, because of their general opposition to the
ACA. Our findings suggest that federal incentives for states
to strengthen their health insurance rate review programs
were more effective than the incentives for states to adopt
other insurance-related policy goals of the ACA.

Note. Rate review program effectiveness was coded based on March 23, 2010, status (when the Affordable Care Act was enacted) and April 16, 2014, status.
Always Eff: always had an effective rate review program since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act; Became Eff: became an effective rate review program after
a change via legislation or regulation; Ineff: ineffective rate review program as of April 16, 2014. Anticipated loss ratio requirement was coded based on March 23,
2010, and December 31, 2013, statuses. Always 75%, always had an anticipated loss ratio requirement at or above 75% since the enactment of the Affordable Care
Act; Became 75%, anticipated loss ratio requirement became at or above 75%; <75%, anticipated loss ratio requirement was less than 75%; None, no anticipated
loss ratio requirement. Medicaid expansion was coded based on August 28, 2014, status. State-based exchange was coded based on October 31, 2013, status.
aThese states have "none" coded in the table because the major carrier type(s) based on market share in the state did not have an anticipated loss
ratio requirement; however, the following minor carrier type(s) did have an anticipated loss ratio requirement: Michigan for-profit insurers (individual
market), Nevada non-profit carriers (individual and small group markets), North Carolina for-profit insurers (individual market) and health maintenance
organizations (HMOs; individual and small group markets), and Pennsylvania for-profit insurers (individual market).
