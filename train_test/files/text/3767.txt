Introduction
In learning process, children not only need to build their own
concepts, but also need to share or communicate their under-
standing to others (Vygotsky, 1980). This requires students to
be active in class, such as by speaking, observing, performing
tasks, and collaborating with friends. Classroom layouts
should be arranged appropriately based on the teaching pur-
pose (Haghighi & Jusan, 2012; Marx, Fuhrer, & Hartig, 1999;
Wannarka & Ruhl, 2008), and it can significantly affect
improvements in the learning process as well as learning out-
comes (Akinolu & Tandogan, 2007; Johnson, 2006;
Kimonen & Nevalainen, 2005; Pardjono, Groves, & Gough,
1999; Rotgans & Schmidt, 2011; Stern & Huber, 1997;
Weltman & Whiteside, 2010). For example, students will
more actively ask questions within a row and column arrange-
ment, and to improve social interaction among students, fur-
niture should be arranged in a semicircle (Marx et al., 1999).
As in the active learning principle, students should be active
mentally and physically to construct knowledge (Dewey,
1938; Pardjono et al., 1999; Piageat, 1999; Vygotsky, 1980),
having children arrange furniture themselves may encourage
the learning process. Therefore, to encourage furniture
arrangement by children for active learning purposes, furni-
ture should be easy for them to transport, which also would
reduce the time required to arrange the classroom layout.
However, not all elementary schools in the world, espe-
cially in developing countries, have adapted accordingly.
Our previous study (Purwaningrum et al., 2015) found that
chairs in Indonesian elementary schools were too heavy for
children aged 6 to 9 to easily carry and lift. In that study, it
took significantly longer for children to complete a carrying
task with the Indonesian chair (weight: 5.0 kg) than with the
two Japanese chairs (weight: 3.2 kg and 3.9 kg). The result

Grasping and Carrying Elementary
School Chairs for Easy Carrying, Lifting,
and Turning

Abstract
Carrying, lifting, and turning chairs improve learning activities in schools, which leads to higher quality education. However,
it has been shown that elementary school chairs in Indonesia are too heavy for children aged 6 to 9 to easily lift and carry.
The present study aimed to investigate children's methods of carrying chairs as well as lifting and turning them onto desks.
Forty-two children (aged 6-9), including 17 Indonesians (6 boys, 11 girls) and 25 Japanese (12 boys, 13 girls), participated in
the study. The experiment used three elementary school chairs (one Indonesian, two Japanese) and two desk types (standard
and tall). The most popular method for carrying a chair was to carry it in front of the body with the chair in a lateral position
(75%). In all carrying methods, participants showed a preference for grasping two particular points to hold the chair. Children
lifted and turned chairs most successfully when they used this popular grasping pattern. The carrying method and the popular
grasping pattern for carrying, lifting, and turning chairs need to be considered when redesigning heavy Indonesian elementary
school chairs to improve the ease of transport without decreasing the weight.

also found that for all children aged 6 to 9, it took children
aged 6 to 8 longer to carry the Indonesian chair than children
aged 9. In lifting and turning chairs onto standard and tall
desks, the Indonesian chair had a lower success rate (around
20%); with 6-year-olds showing especially low success rates.
Thus, according to (Purwaningrum et al., 2015), the weight
of Indonesian elementary school chairs was not appropriate
for children of a certain age, and decreasing the weight of
chairs was therefore recommended to encourage dynamic
classroom activities.
In developed countries, decreasing chair weight to accom-
modate children using light, strong, and durable materials
and constructions through a qualified manufacturer might be
rather easy to execute. In developing countries such as
Indonesia, however, there are problems with manufacturing.
A simple solution for developing countries might be to pro-
duce two types of elementary school chairs--one for ages 6
to 9 and another for ages 10 to 12. However, school furniture
producers that use conventional woodworking will face pro-
duction obstacles, such as difficulties establishing standard-
ized manufacturing processes with strong quality controls
and effective management. Moreover, it will require increas-
ing the price of furniture that is too expensive for developing
countries. Therefore, if developing countries produce chairs
using the same product used in developed countries but in
lower price, they might be frail.
Focusing on how elementary school children as a user
carry, lift, and turn chairs in common class activities can pro-
vide alternative strategies for modifying Indonesian elemen-
tary school chairs without decreasing their weight. Due to
individual differences in age, physique, knowledge, and so
on, children use various carrying methods to complete the
same tasks. Previous studies have focused on the effects of
carrying methods on anterior load carrying capability. It was
found that carrying a load at hand height had better carrying
capacity than carrying at elbow height (Mital & Okolie,
1982; Snook, 1978). As such, examining popular carrying
methods could indicate that it might be easier for children to
perform tasks using their preferred methods.
Thus, the second factor (after weight) in investigating
Indonesian elementary school chairs is the parts of chair
most popularly used for grasping. Some parts of these chairs
are too thick for children to grasp. Moreover, there are sharp
corners, making them unsafe. The shapes of these chairs sug-
gest they were not designed to be easily moved. Without
improvements, such poorly designed chairs can create haz-
ardous situations and possibly result in injuries. Thus, in
redesigning chairs without decreasing their weight for
improved ease of transport, parts popularly used for grasping
should be suitably shaped to facilitate effective methods of
lifting, carrying, and turning.
To obtain useful basic data for redesigning Indonesian
elementary school chairs to be easily carried, lifted, and
turned by children aged 6 to 9, this study investigated the
methods children aged 6 to 9 used to carry chairs, and to lift
and turn them onto desks. First, we examined chair-carrying
methods, including direction and sequence. Second, we
investigated which parts of chairs were most commonly
grasped while performing tasks.
Method
Participants
The participants were 42 right-handed children (aged 6-9),
including 17 Indonesians (six boys and 11 girls) and 25
Japanese (12 boys and 13 girls). The mean ± standard devi-
ations (SD) for the anthropometric data of all participants
were as follows: age: 7.8 ± 1.0 years; body height: 122.7 ±
7.1 cm; body weight: 24.5 ± 3.5 kg; and grip strength: 9.23
± 2.2 kgf.
As Indonesia is the main target of this study, Indonesian
children were involved in the experiment. This study also
involved children and chair of Japanese nationality as a com-
parison. Generally, given user that using the product in daily
life are familiar, and perform better. Japanese children use
their furniture, and Indonesian children use their furniture.
Therefore, including both Japanese and Indonesian children
in this study are fair to avoid a bias.
However, the sex of Indonesian and Japanese children in
this study was mixed up as previous studies about the designs
of elementary school furniture regarded that sex is not a fac-
tor that determines the dimensions of school furniture
(Adewole & Isedowo, 2012; Dhara, Khaspuri, & Sau, 2009).
Furthermore, the Japanese and Indonesian children were
mixed up according to the anthropological database of
Japanese and Indonesians (Ministry of Education, 2014;
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Statistics
Bureau of Japan, 2013; Purwaningrum, Aryani, Mulyadi, &
Yassierlie, 2011; Rosyidi, Susmartini, Purwaningrum, &
Muraki, 2014), which showed that the heights and weights of
children aged 6 to 9 are similar.
The ethics committee of the Faculty of Design, Kyushu
University, Japan, approved the experiment of this study
(Approval Number: 125), and participants' parents signed
informed consent forms before the study.
Experimental Instruments
Chairs.To compare the effects of three dimensions and
weight conditions on the carrying, lifting, and turning a chair
method, this experiment examined two Japanese (Chairs A
and B) and one Indonesian (Chair C) elementary school chair.
Chairs A and B were Size 2 (width: 340 mm; depth: 290 mm;
seat height: 300 mm; weight: 3.2 kg) and Size 3 (width: 360
mm; depth: 290 mm; seat height: 340 mm; weight: 3.9 kg),
respectively. The dimensions of Chairs A and B were appro-
priate for children aged 6 to 9 (International Organization for
Standardization [IOS], 1979) whose heights ranged from 117
to 130 cm and 131 to 144 cm, respectively. The Indonesian
Purwaningrum et al. 3
chair (Chair C) was produced in Indonesia; it was made
entirely of wood with a seat height of 420 mm, a width of 385
mm, a depth of 385 mm, and a weight of 5.0 kg. This chair
type is widely used in Indonesia's public elementary schools
(IOS, 1979; Ministry of National Education, 2007). The
weight of Chair C fell within the lowest weight range based
on a pilot survey of 11 public elementary schools in Indonesia
(Rosyidi et al., 2014). The dimension of the chair was the
same as the dimension of the chairs generally used that are
same for all grade in Indonesian elementary schools (Purwan-
ingrum et al., 2011).
Desks. In this study, desks were only used in the experiment
for lifting and turning chairs. Two desk height conditions
were used. The first was a Japanese elementary school desk
(Size 3; height: 580 mm; weight: 8.4 kg) that is typically
used by elementary school children 131 to 144 cm in height.
This condition met ISO 5970 (IOS, 1979). The second type
was the same as the first, but a box was placed under the desk
for additional height (100 mm). The new height simulated
the average typical height of Indonesian elementary school
desks (550-750 mm; Purwaningrum et al., 2011; Rosyidi
et al., 2014). As the study compared the effects of height dif-
ferences between Indonesian and Japanese desks on lifting
and turning chairs, this simulation was sufficient for the task.
Experimental Tasks, Conditions, and Procedures
Two tasks--(a) carrying a chair and (b) lifting and turning a
chair onto a desk--were performed in an appropriate experi-
mental space. First, participants were briefed on the proce-
dures for completing each task. They could say "stop" to
move on to the next task if they felt the present task was too
difficult or impossible to finish. Moreover, a stop instruction
would be issued immediately if it appeared to the researcher
that it would be impossible or dangerous to continue the task.
For safety, participants wore nonslip work gloves and shoes,
and an adult guard stood beside the participants. To prevent
injury, fear, and so on, and allow participants to easily judge
whether they could perform the next task, tasks were
sequenced from lighter (smaller) to heavier (larger) furni-
ture. After each task, the participant's condition was checked
(e.g., indications of pain, fatigue, lack of motivation, etc.) to
determine whether he or she should continue to the next task.
In the task of carrying a chair, each chair (A, B, and C)
was brought from the start to finish line. The distance
between lines was 3 m. First, participants sat on the chair
which was placed sideways behind the start line. Second,
after start command, participants stood up and carried the
chair toward the finish line. Finally, the chair was put down
on the floor beyond the finish line. In this task, some proce-
dures must be followed by participants: (a) any part of the
chair could be hold; (b) the chair should not push or slide on
the floor; (c) walking speed during the task should be at an
ordinary.
In the task of lifting and turning a chair, each chair (A, B,
and C) was turned upside down and put on two desk heights
(standard desk height: 580 mm; taller desk height: 680 mm).
Before start command, the participant sat on the chair that
was placed in front of the desk. Then, the participant stood
up from the chair, turned the chair upside down, and put it on
top of the desk after the start command. In this task, any part
of the chair could be held. The chair could be rotated on the
floor if it is necessary.
Measurement
Each participant's movement was recorded by a digital
video camera (Panasonic, HC­V 300 M, Japan) at 30
frames per second. To record tasks in detail, the camera
was operated freely by hand (i.e., not mounted, as on a
tripod), following participants' movements step by step,
such as their methods for carrying chairs and their grasp-
ing positions on the chairs.
Grasping parts of the chairs.Before conducting the experi-
ments, 18 parts of the chairs were coded A-R as the possible
points that might be grasped by participants (Figure 1).

Criteria for success in lifting and turning chairs. Success criteria
were established before performing the experiment involv-
ing lifting and turning chairs onto desks. The task was judged
successful if the participant executed it smoothly, that is if
they could complete lifting and turning the chair without
dropping the chair or stopping, and if there were no indica-
tions of danger. Danger was indicated if the grasp was unsta-
ble, that is, grasping the chair so that it tended to fall to the
floor. The task was judged unsuccessful if the participant
failed to smoothly lift and turn the chair onto the desk.
Statistical Analysis
The SPSS statistical package (IBM SPSS version 21.0 for
Windows, Chicago, USA) was used to analyze the data.
The exact chi-square test (Field, 2013; Sheskin, 2004) was
calculated to analyze the effects of chair type on the suc-
cess rate.
Results
Carrying Chairs
The methods for carrying chairs were categorized based on
the chair's direction, its orientation, and how many hands the
child used. Figure 2 shows the four carrying methods.
Carrying Method 1: The chair was carried in front of the
child's body with two hands on two parts of the chair, and
the chair's orientation was lateral.
Carrying Method 2: The chair was carried in front of the
child's body with two hands on two parts of the chair, and
the chair's direction was either forward or backward.
Carrying Method 3: The chair was carried in front of the
child's body with one hand in one position.
Carrying Method 4: The chair was carried in front or at
the side of the child's body with two hands on one part of
the chair.
During the task of carrying a chair, an inconsistent proce-
dure was shown by one participant. To obtain a reliable find-
ing, even though he could complete the task, his result was
omitted in the analysis. Thus, the number of participants in
the carrying a chair task became 41. Figure 3 shows the per-
centages of carrying methods used by participants for each
chair type in the experiment. Even though the dimension and
the weight of three chair types, and design between Japanese
and Indonesian chair were different, the percentages of each
carrying method for all chair types were similar. Method 1
was used the most (73%-78%), followed by Method 2 (15%-
17%). Methods 3 (5%) and 4 (2%-5%) were rarely used. The
exact chi-square test indicated there was no significant effect
of chair type on carrying method.
The participants employed various grasping patterns,
using one or two hands to grasp certain parts of the chairs.
Table 1 shows nine grasping patterns used by participants:AJ,
BJ, DJ, GJ, HI, OO, BB, O, and B. AJ, for example, means
the chair was grasped by two hands with the right or left hand
on Part A and the other hand on Part J. In Patterns B and O,
the chair was grasped using only the left or right hand.

Each carrying method had specific grasping patterns. For
example, Method 1 showed patterns AJ, BJ, DJ, and GJ;
Method 2 showed patterns HI and OO; Method 3 showed
patterns BB and O; and Method 4 showed patterns B and
OO. Pattern OO, observed in Methods 2 and 4, was a special
case. Using Figure 2, those conditions could be illustrated:
Method 1 indicates grasping pattern AJ; Method 2 indicates
grasping pattern HI; Method 3 indicates grasping pattern O;
Method 4 indicates grasping pattern OO. Table 2 shows the
percentages of grasping patterns used for each chair type.
Parts J, A, and B showed a higher frequency than the other
parts. Meanwhile, Parts C, E, F, K, L, M, and N were not
used by any participants.
Lifting and Turning Chairs Onto Desks
Popular grasping patterns. Participants lifted and turned chairs
onto desks using various grasping patterns on different parts
of the chairs. They completed the task in steps using different
grasping patterns. Grasping patterns were categorized
according to the child's first step in grasping the chair. Forty
second-step grasping patterns were identified for all chairs
and desks. Participants primarily used seven grasping pat-
terns, with AJ/JA and BJ/BA as the most popular. The 33
other patterns were less popular. Table 3 shows the distribu-
tion of the popular grasping patterns.
Popular grasping patterns and success rates.Figure 4 shows
effect of chair type and popular/unpopular grasping patterns
on success rates for lifting and turning three types of chairs
onto standard and tall desks. For both desk types, the popular
grasping patterns had higher success rates than the unpopular
ones with each chair type (Figure 4). The success rates for
both popular and unpopular grasping patterns decreased
gradually from Chairs A to C with both desks. The highest
success rate (90%) was achieved with Chair A and the stan-
dard desk. The lowest success rates, or unpopular grasping
patterns, occurred with Chair C with the tall (12%) and stan-
dard desks (20%; Table 3; Figure 4).
Figure 5 shows effect of popular/unpopular grasping pat-
tern on success rates for lifting and turning all chair types
with both standard and tall desks. The exact chi-square test
showed a significant effect of popular and unpopular patterns
on success rate among chair types at taller desk (p < .05) but
not at standard desks. Interestingly, for both standard and
taller desks, the popular pattern had a higher success rate
than the unpopular patterns, with taller desk with tall desks
(60% and 40%, respectively), and with standard desks (60%
and 50%, respectively).
The most popular of first-step grasping patterns (AJ/JA
and BJ/BA) were followed by the second-step grasping pat-
terns. The most popular of them were NL/LN and MK/KM.
As NL/LN and MK/KM are the same (left and right of the
chair's feet), they were categorized into the same group
(Table 4).
Discussion
Carrying Chairs
This study considered how children carry chairs to redesign
them for easier transport. Carrying Method 1 (Figure 2), in
which the chair was carried in a lateral orientation in front of
the child's body with two hands on two parts of the chair,
was the most popular. Understanding how humans use a
product is an important factor in product development (Green
& Jordan, 1999; Jordan, 2002; Sanders, 1999; Sanders,
2002). The preferred carrying method in this study was sup-
ported by previous research showing that a user's pleasur-
able feelings in choosing a product or tool correlate to
psychological rather than physical or usability factors (
Jordan, 2002). Furthermore, in the material-handling field,
Jordan (2002) and Kuijt-Evers, Twisk, Groenesteijn, De
Looze, and Vink (2005) found that an object's appearance
affected comfort and preference during handling. In the pres-
ent study, the shape (appearance) of the chair led children to
use carrying Method 1. This was because the position of the
hands on the chair tended to balance and stabilize the direc-
tion of the chair mass so that it seemed easy and comfortable.
Future research should investigate whether Method 1 is
indeed the easiest and safest way for children to carry chairs.
This study showed that chair-carrying methods involved the
child's preference for grasping certain parts of the chair. The
most popular grasping patterns in M 1 were AJ and BJ (Table
1)--that is, PartsAand B on the top and bottom of the chair's

back and Part J on the front of the seat (Tables 1 and 2). The
Indonesian chair's features were too large for the anthropom-
etry of children aged 6 to 9 (Purwaningrum et al., 2011;
Rosyidi et al., 2014). Specifically, the distance between Parts
A and B for the right hand and Part J for the left was too
large. In addition, its heavy weight (Purwaningrum, Funatsu,
Xiong, Rosyidi, & Muraki, 2015) and sharp shape could
increase the difficulty of carrying it with a balanced posture
and potentially cause injury. Therefore, to improve the ease
of transporting Indonesian elementary school chairs without
decreasing their weight, the parts children prefer to grasp
should be considered.
Lifting and Turning Chairs
The results for lifting and turning chairs onto desks also pro-
vide guidelines for redesigning chairs based on grasping pat-
terns. The main considerations were the AJ/JA and BJ/JB
patterns, which were used most often in the first step for each
type of chair and desk (Table 3; Figure 6). Furthermore, AJ/JA
and BJ/JB had higher success rates than the less popular grasp-
ing patterns for each type of chair and desk (Figures 4 and 5).
Thus, AJ/JA and BJ/JB are the ideal grasping patterns for chil-
dren to easily lift and turn both Indonesian and Japanese chairs.
The secondary considerations were the NL/LN and MN/
NM patterns, which were used most often in the second step
Figure 4. Success rates of popular and unpopular grasping patterns in lifting and turning three types of chairs onto standard and tall
desks.

following the most popular grasping patterns in the first step
(Table 4, Figure 6). Further, NL/LN is equivalent to MK/
KM, and MN/NM is equivalent to KL/LK. Therefore, pat-
terns MK/KM, MN/NM, and KL/LK should be considered
secondarily after AJ/JA and BJ/JB to improve the ease of lift-
ing and turning chairs.
The popular patterns (AJ/JA, BJ/JB) nevertheless had
low success rates with Chair C and both desks (Figure 4),
indicating that lifting and turning the Indonesian chair was
difficult. Meanwhile, the popular patterns' high success
rates with Chair A showed that Japanese chairs could be eas-
ily lifted and turned. In addition, the exact chi-square test
found that the popular patterns' success rates were signifi-
cantly higher than the unpopular ones only with the tall
Indonesian desk. Therefore, grasping patterns must be con-
sidered in redesigning Indonesian chairs to make the task of
lifting and turning chairs onto tall Indonesian desks easier.
The results for both tasks (carrying and lifting/turning
chairs) showed that Parts A, B, and J were used most by chil-
dren. Those parts were designed more safely on the Japanese
chair than the Indonesian chair. The rounded corners and
proper sizes of the Japanese chair parts make it easy for chil-
dren to grasp and carry the chairs. However, those parts are
dangerous on Indonesian chairs, making them difficult for
children to carry, lift, and turn. The parts are large, there is no
convenient place for children to grasp them, and the sharp cor-
ners could cause injuries. Moreover, the chair's dimensions
are unsuitable for children, especially for children aged 6 to 8
(Purwaningrum et al., 2011; Rosyidi et al., 2014). The awk-
ward shapes, weights, and dimensions could cause them to
drop the chair. Therefore, considering grasping patterns for
redesigning chairs promotes safety in addition to easy lifting.
Conclusion
This study utilized how preference of user to carry, lift and
turn a chair easily. The furniture which is easy to transport
should be provided due to the proper layout arrangement are
required for a teaching purpose (Haghighi & Jusan, 2012;
Marx et al., 1999; Wannarka & Ruhl, 2008) in an active learn-
ing to improve quality of education. The problem with
Indonesian furniture was not only improper dimension
(Purwaningrum et al., 2011; Rosyidi et al., 2014) but also the
weight was too heavy to transport for children, especially for
children aged 6 to 9 years (Purwaningrum et al., 2015). The
observation found a key point, and an alternative solution
should be considered for redesigning and modifying the heavy
Indonesian elementary school chairs without decreasing their
weight. Moreover, to decrease the weight of Indonesian school
furniture will face a manufacturing problem. To our knowl-
edge, using grasping patterns as a criterion for designing ele-
mentary school chairs for easy lifting and turning is new in this
research area. The investigations in this area should factor in
two aspects: the methods of carrying chairs and the most pop-
ular grasping patterns for carrying, lifting, and turning them. It
would be interesting for future investigations to evaluate the
effectiveness of such modified Indonesian elementary school
chairs so that encourage the active learning in a classroom.
