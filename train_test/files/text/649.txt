Challenges Of State
Health Reform:
Variations In Ten States
Estimates abound on how many Americans lack insurance
coverage. A new survey of families uncovers new challenges
for states in crafting their own strategies for the uninsured.
by Joel C. Cantor, Stephen H. Long, and M. Susan Marquis
ABSTRACT: This DataWatch reports on the key findings from the 1993 Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation Family Health Insurance Survey, which interviewed
more than 27,000 families in ten states. There is considerable variation among
the states in insurance coverage, health status, and access to care of both
adults and children. Moreover, states with higher percentages of uninsured
residents also have populations with lower health status and more access
problems. This clustering of problems in certain states may make health care
reform even more challenging for their elected officials to accomplish.
Only a few years ago national health care reform was at
the center of health policy discussions.1 Over a longer period,
several states have shown interest in health care reform, and
some of them have legislated and implemented reforms.2 Now Con-
gress and the Clinton administration have joined them by express-
ing strong interest in increasing state flexibility and responsibility
for reform. For example, the Clinton administration has strongly
supported Section 1115 Medicaid waivers, and the new State Chil-
dren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), signed into law as part of
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, relies on federal grants to partici-
pating states, which will design and administer the program.3
The problems to be corrected by health care reform have been
well documented for the nation as a whole. We know a good deal
about the number of uninsured Americans, their characteristics, and
the implications of being uninsured for access to health care and use
of services.4 On the other hand, as the focus shifts to the states, it is
important to ask if these national patterns represent the circum-
stances of all states equally well. To put it another way, does each

state need to overcome the same health care problems in degree and
in kind? Although we do have estimates of variation in the uninsur-
ance rate by state from a national survey, there is limited comparable
information on state circumstances along several other problem
dimensions.5
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) launched a pro-
gram, State Initiatives in Health Care Reform, in 1991 to award
grants to individual states to assist them with the process of design-
ing and implementing health care reforms.6 The grantee states were
selected, in part, for their geographic diversity, the extent of unin-
surance, and the proposed approach to reform. Although the grantee
states were required to have a clear, prospective plan for health care
reform, they varied widely in the extent of previous reforms, and
several of them had no history of reform.7 As part of the RWJF
program, we developed and fielded two surveys to better under-
stand the states' problems, analyze policy options, and collect base-
line data to support subsequent evaluation of outcomes. An earlier
report described results from the Employer Health Insurance Sur-
vey.8 In this paper we report key results from the Family Health
Insurance Survey.
Study Methods
The RWJF Family Health Insurance Survey was conducted in the
latter half of 1993 and early 1994 in Colorado, Florida, Minnesota,
New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Ver-
mont, and Washington State.9 It collected detailed information on
insurance status, as well as information on demographic charac-
teristics, employment, income, health status, access to health care,
and use of health services.10 Response rates ranged from a low of 61
percent in New York to a high of 83 percent in North Dakota.
More than 2,000 twenty-five-minute telephone interviews were
conducted with families in each state, supplemented by 100­200
in-person interviews in households having no telephone. This
yielded a total of 27,138 families containing 62,549 persons across
the ten states. Families with Medicaid enrollees or uninsured per-
sons were oversampled using a general population telephone
screening interview. The Medicaid population identified in the
screening interview was supplemented by sampling from program
enrollment lists in nine of the ten states. Finally, households with-
out telephones in a few geographic areas in each state were identi-
fied and interviewed in person.
The interview unit was the family. Within each family, the survey
collected all data items for all adults; insurance and other charac-
teristics were collected for all children, but health status and service

use for only one randomly selected child per family.
We used sample weights to make estimates. The weights adjust
for the probability of selection and for differential nonresponse
among subgroups of families. The estimates are for the nonelderly
population and are provided separately for adults and children. All
insurance and health status estimates refer to the day of the inter-
view. The estimates of health service use and measures of access
problems--not having a usual provider and not receiving selected
health services--refer to various reference periods preceding the
interview.
Study Findings
Overall, the ten survey states are quite representative of all fifty
states in the average level and variability of several important popu-
lation, health care system, and health policy characteristics (Exhibit
1). For example, personal income per capita in 1993 was $20,800 in
all states and $21,770 in the ten survey states, while the range was
$14,745­$28,151 over all states and $16,295­$24,844 over the ten
survey states. To cite another example, the survey states cover
nearly the complete range of generosity in Medicaid program eligi-
bility, as measured by the ratio of Medicaid recipients to the popula-
tion in poverty. Measures of variation in managed care penetration
and the supply of hospitals and physicians also are very similar.
Extent of insurance coverage. The health care circumstances of
people in the ten study states vary substantially (Exhibit 2). The
percentage of the nonelderly population without health insurance
coverage in 1993 varied nearly threefold, from 27 percent in New
Mexico to 10 percent in Minnesota. The percentage of uninsured
persons is lower for children (under age eighteen) than it is for
adults (ages eighteen to sixty-four) in nine states. However, the
range of variation among the states in the percentage of uninsured
persons is greater for children (ratio of the high to low state is 4.0 to
1) than it is for adults (2.5 to 1).
Health status and access. Key measures of health status and
access to care follow a similar pattern (Exhibit 2). The percentage of
adults and children reported to be in fair or poor health (on a five-
level scale) or reported to have no usual source of medical care other
than an emergency department are highest in the states with a high
percentage of uninsured persons.11 As we observed in patterns of
insurance coverage, there is more interstate variation among chil-
dren than there is among adults. The ratio of the high to the low
state on both measures is at least twice as great among children as it
is among adults.

hibits that follow, we examine insurance coverage, health status,
and access in greater depth. In each, we group the three states with
the highest percentage of uninsured persons and the three states
with the lowest percentage of uninsured persons. Specifically, we
compare circumstances in Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma--
the high-uninsured states--with those in Minnesota, North Da-
kota, and Vermont--the low-uninsured states.
These and the estimates that follow are based on simple means of
the separate estimates for the three individual states (that is, they
are not weighted by each state's population), because our objective
is to use these states as observations to characterize circumstances
in similarly situated states that were not studied. In contrasting the
patterns for high- and low-uninsured states, we examined the con-
ditions for the middle four states grouped (not shown in the exhib-
its). With the exception of one measure (childhood immunization
compliance), estimates of health care problems for the middle four
states fell between those for the high- and low-uninsured states.
Insurance coverage. Exhibit 3 shows the distribution of public
and private health insurance coverage of adults and children. The
interstate variation in the uninsured rate for each age group is mir-
rored by differences in the rate of private coverage, but the percent-
age with public coverage in each age group varies little among the
states.12 Therefore, the relatively wider interstate spread in the per-
centage of children without coverage--also seen in Exhibit 2--
stems from wider variations in the rate of private coverage for them.
Health status. Persons living in states with a higher percentage
of uninsured persons are also more likely to be in ill health. Adults

and children are each about twice as likely to be reported in fair or
poor health in the three high-uninsured states compared with the
three low-uninsured states--a gap of six percentage points among
adults and two percentage points among children (Exhibit 4). Also,
the percentage of adults limited in the kind or amount of vigorous or
moderate physical activity (for example, lifting heavy objects, mov-
ing a table, or carrying groceries) is modestly higher in the high-
uninsured states.13
Access to care. The measures of access to care shown in Exhibit
5 reveal greater problems in the three states with the highest per-
centage of uninsured than in the three low-uninsured states. The
first two measures of poor access--lack of a usual source of care
(other than the emergency department), and not receiving emer-
gency care when needed--are two to three times higher in the
high-uninsured states. The rates of these access problems are higher
for adults than they are for children.

We also examined four other, less subjective measures of access
to care (Exhibit 5). First, among adults and children the percentage
with no doctor visit in the year prior to the survey is about 1.2 and 1.5
times greater, respectively, in the high-uninsured states than in the
low-uninsured states. This difference prevails despite the fact that
people in the high-uninsured states are in poorer health, which
should make them more likely to have seen a physician. Three meas-
ures of preventive services use show similar patterns. The percent-
age of women ages nineteen to sixty-four who fail to receive a rec-
ommended Pap smear, the percentage of women ages forty-one to
sixty-four who fail to obtain at least one mammogram, and the
percentage of children ages two to four who fail to receive at least
one recommended immunization were between 1.2 and 1.5 times
greater in the high-uninsured states.14
Discussion
In the current political environment, much of the responsibility
for improving health care access and affordability is vested in gover-
nors and state legislatures rather than in the federal government.
The new CHIP provides federal funds to assist states in providing
coverage to their low-income, uninsured children. However, to par-
ticipate in CHIP, states also must contribute payments to the pro-
gram and make many decisions about its design.15 In this DataWatch
we found considerable interstate variability in the health insurance

coverage of children. While the percentage of uninsured children is
lower than the percentage of uninsured adults in most states, still
almost one-quarter of all children are uninsured in the three states
with the highest uninsured rates. Thus, the ease with which some
states would have been able to take significant steps on their own to
close the gap in the care of children may be less than widely be-
lieved. This suggests that federal support for states' efforts, as em-
bodied in CHIP, is well placed. This program may help to diminish
the disparity we now see among states in the rate of uninsured
children.
We find that health care problems cluster within states: Those
with the highest percentages of uninsured persons also have lower
levels of average health status and higher levels of access problems.
States with both a high percentage of their population without
insurance and with low health status will have to spend more per
capita than other states spend to attain equivalent outcomes. The
substantial variation suggests that a strategy relying on incremental,
state-by-state action is likely to leave the nation with significant
lingering gaps in the health care of many Americans. While some
states such as Minnesota and Vermont may be expected to redress a
significant part of their respective health system problems, the chal-
lenges to other states such as Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma
are far greater.
Although our results provide a better quantification of the prob-
lems state health reformers face, their policy implications are not
entirely clear. We observe considerable clustering of various prob-
lems among states with the highest rates of uninsurance. Yet from
the data presented here, we cannot discern whether this represents
the coincidence of several different problems, each requiring a dif-
ferent policy remedy, or the single core problem of inadequate rates
of insurance, with the obvious policy implication to expand cover-
age. There is a well-documented connection between lower rates of
coverage and poorer access to medical care, but we cannot be sure
that this is the only cause of the access shortfalls that we observe
among the states. Moreover, it is possible that the lower levels of
health status in the high-uninsured states merely reflect the effects
of long-standing insurance coverage gaps and correspondingly
poorer access to care. On the other hand, the observed health status
differences also could be the result of differences in income, educa-
"A strategy relying on incremental, state-by-state action is likely
to leave significant lingering gaps in health care."

health care reform either is or is not simply a matter of insurance

search, SurveyDesignandData CollectionMethodsfor theRobertWood JohnsonFounda-
tion's Family Survey on Health Insurance (Princeton, N.J.: MPR, 14 September
1994). The data cleaning procedures are described in L.M. Andrews, S.H.
Long, and M.S. Marquis, Data Cleaning Procedures for the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Family Health Insurance Survey, MR-862-RWJ (Santa Monica, Calif.:
RAND, 1997).
10. In addition to the customary types of insurance coverage collected in national
surveys (Medicare, Medicaid, Civilian Health and Medical Program of the
Uniformed Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, employment-based, and
other private), the survey included state-specific probes for special subsidized
insurance programs by name in states where they were available.
11. These comparisons do not directly adjust for differences among the states in
their demographic profiles. However, there is some age standardization in
limiting the comparisons to persons under age sixty-five and in comparing
adults and children separately. Nonetheless, there may be differences in the
composition of the states' populations that relate both to insurance status and
access.
12. In contrast, Cathy Schoen and colleagues, in "Insurance Matters for Low-
Income Adults," found that differences in the number of uninsured among
low-income adults in the five states included in the Kaiser/Commonwealth
survey were mirrored by differences in Medicaid coverage, rather than by
differences in private insurance. The Kaiser/Commonwealth survey was ad-
ministered after recent expansions in the Medicaid program in several of the
states. In addition, differences in the populations covered in the two surveys
(all persons versus the low-income population) might have contributed to the
different findings.
13. The survey did not include questions about physical limitations among chil-
dren.

mended immunizations if they were reported as not having received any one of
the following vaccinations: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT);
poliovirus; or measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Age-specific immuniza-
tion recommendations are based on Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, "Immunization of Adolescents: Recommendations of the Advisory Com-
mittee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Medical Associa-
