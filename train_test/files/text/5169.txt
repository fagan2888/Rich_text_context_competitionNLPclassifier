Introduction
The past decade has brought with it a substantial interest in
exploring the connection between the microbial world of
our gut and other important aspects of health, including
immune functioning, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunc-
tion, metabolism, and obesity (Bravo etal., 2012; Collen,
2015; DeSalle and Perkins, 2015; Lynch and Pedersen,
2016; Mayer, 2011).An expanding branch of this research--
of particular interest to mental health professionals--is pro-
viding evidence that supports a strong link between the
microbial state of our gut and our emotional functioning,
particularly in relation to stress, anxiety and depression
(Dinan and Cryan, 2012; Foster and McVey Neufeld, 2013;
Wang and Kasper, 2014). Furthermore, the microbial func-
tions of our gut may also have significant influence on
more profound disorders, such as autism (Mayer et
al.,
2014). Since much of the research is found in the biological
and medical literature, published work can prove to be
quite cumbersome to digest and apply for those trained in
the behavioral sciences. The purpose of this article can be
described in three parts. One, regardless of training or theo-
retical orientation, the information provided here will hope-
fully inform all mental health practitioners that a previously
untapped domain may better assist in understanding and
treating patients. Second, some general information per-
taining to gut health is provided. Along with this informa-
tion, it must be understood that individual dietary treatments
are best provided by professionals who are adequately
trained in such areas. Third, since most of the literature in
this area can feel quite foreign and overwhelming for clini-
cians, this topic will be succinctly broached from a stance
that is more user-friendly to clinicians not directly trained
in biology or medicine.
The conventional practice in therapy has been to focus on
the more established variables known to underlie mental
health--childhood experiences, relationships with significant
others, our individual history of learning, and nervous system
functioning.The process of psychotherapy most often focuses
on two aspects. From a psychological approach, we work
with clients through listening, reflecting, acknowledging

to the growing connection between gut
health and emotional well-being

Abstract
The microbial environment of the human gut has powerful influence on immunity, metabolism, and obesity. There is now
emerging evidence that the microbiome of our gastrointestinal system may also be a key factor impacting our emotional
and behavioral health. The purpose of this article is to elucidate how this emerging area of science can further educate
and encourage mental health professionals to explore an additional means to treatment. Since much of this research is
found in the biological and neuroscientific literature, it can be quite cumbersome for clinicians to digest and apply, who
would critically benefit from a concise discussion of the gut­brain connection.

insights, trying to address their past and understand current
thoughts and behaviors. Although the work of therapy can
vary greatly based on the theoretical orientation of the thera-
pist, all can be viewed as a form of "talk therapy," where vari-
ous aspects of the psychological domain are understood as the
cause for distress. It is this traditional focus on behavioral and
psychological variables that can be understood as the first tier
in treatment.
The second area that is often addressed in mental health
comes from biology and the medical sciences. Psychiatrists
have provided us invaluable science and medication to
understand and assist patients who are in need of treatment.
The strength of the medical world is so great--that the notion
of chemical connections in the brain--and its relation to a
patient's emotional state and behavior is often addressed
even by practitioners who are not specifically trained in med-
icine. Antidepressants, anxiolytic medication, and other
powerful psychotropic medications are widely accepted by
practitioners, patients, and the public as an important factor
in treatment. Building on the traditional aspects of therapy
aforementioned, use of psychotropic intervention would be
considered the second tier in the healing process.
However, in addition to the psychological and neuro-
chemical variables that contribute to our emotional state
and behavior, there is mounting evidence that the state of
our digestive system--our gut--may be a key factor sig-
nificantly influencing our mental health (Cryan and Dinan,
2012; Dinan and Cryan, 2013). This rapidly emerging
domain is providing powerful indications that a new piece
of the puzzle must be added as the third tier toward a more
comprehensive understanding and treatment of patients.
A bit of biology
Our body is not uniquely human. It is estimated that the
number of uniquely human cells in one person ranges from
nearly 10
trillion to over 30
trillion cells (Bianconi etal.,
2013; Mayer, 2016). In addition to our "own" cells, an esti-
mated additional 100
trillion "foreign" cells reside in and
on us (Collen, 2015; Gill et
al., 2006; Mayer, 2016).
Collectively, these organisms, predominantly classified as
bacteria and largely residing in our gut, are referred to as a
microbiome (DeSalle and Perkins, 2015). By definition, a
microbiome is the entirety of microscopic organisms and
their genetic material that inhabit a particular environment
(Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). Rather than comparing the
number of human versus non-human cells in and on a per-
son, differences in genetic material may be compared.
Humans have an estimated 20,000 different genes. This
pales in comparison with the additional eight million differ-
ent genes that comprise our microbiome (National Institutes
of Health (NIH), 2012). Thus, we are harboring within us
over 360 times more genetic material than is our own.
The organisms of our microbiome, having co-evolved
with us for millennia, interact with our body in intricate and
balanced ways, to powerfully assist and influence our met-
abolic, immune, behavioral, and numerous other functions
(DeSalle and Perkins, 2015). In turn, we provide them a
home to survive, reproduce, and evolve. The relationship
between "us" and "them" is predominantly balanced, pro-
viding countless commensal and mutualistic exchanges
(Wang and Kasper, 2014). Health problems arise when dys-
biosis, an unhealthy imbalance of such bacteria, occurs.
Illnesses, a course of antibiotics, a change in location, poor
diet, and various other factors can cause the natural state of
our microbiome to become imbalanced (Collen, 2015).
Although dysbiosis can be corrected over time, research
suggests that chronic states of dysbiosis may be a key factor
leading to many serious ailments, including obesity, aller-
gies, psychiatric, and behavioral problems (Chutkan, 2015;
Collen, 2015; Logan etal., 2016).
Putting our microbiome aside for a moment, how does
communication between two seemingly separate parts of
the body occur? The vagus nerve is the main communica-
tion link between the brain and the gut. What is most
interesting, even when the vagus nerve is severed, and the
link is broken, the gut continues to function. This is due to
the fact the human gut is the only organ that has a nervous
system that is functionally separate from the autonomic
nervous system. Biologically classified as the enteric
nervous system (ENS), consisting of nearly 100
million
neuronal connections, and the ability to function indepen-
dently, it is often referred to as the second brain (Carpenter,
2012). Adding the trillions of actions and interactions of
the gut bacteria back into the communication network,
evidence is supporting the existence of a powerful and
three-factor link known as the microbiota­gut­brain axis,
working in complex ways to affect a host of behaviors,
emotional experiences, and disease (Cryan and O'Mahony,
2010; Foster and McVey Neufeld, 2013; Mayer et
al.,
2015; Wang and Kasper, 2014). One example of the
microbiota­gut­brain axis is in the production and use of
serotonin, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is strongly
correlated with depression. Although serotonin is com-
monly associated with location in the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS), it is found not only in the brain but is also
created in the gut. Strikingly, about 95percent of our sero-
tonin is synthesized by bacteria in the gut! (Carpenter,
2012). Thus, complex communication pathways involv-
ing production and adequate levels of serotonin, the ENS,
the vagus nerve, and CNS serve to provide solid basis to
infer that the microbiome of our gut should act as a critical
variable concerning depression. Although no studies to
date have specifically investigated the effect of chronic
dysbiosis on serotonin synthesis in the human gut, based
on what we know regarding this three-factor link, it can be
hypothesized that a state of microbial imbalance in the gut
may have a direct adverse effect on the functions of both
the ENS and CNS and subsequent experience of depres-
sion (Mayer, 2016).

Probiotics and prebiotics
A discussion about the impact of our gut health on our
behavior and emotional well-being cannot occur without
addressing two very important players: probiotics and
prebiotics. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2002)
defines probiotics as "live microorganisms which when
administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit
on the host" (p. 8). Dietary supplements aside, probiotics
are found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and cer-
tain fermented vegetables to name a few (Chutkan, 2015).
Some of these microorganisms, many of which reside in
our gut, were initially obtained moments after birth (Collen,
2015; Se Jin Song etal., 2013). Others have hitched a ride
from contact with people, animals, and objects in our envi-
ronment and have set up a home inside and on us over the
course of our lifetime (DeSalle and Perkins, 2015).
However, the details of specific strains of bacteria and their
potential effects on our body are beyond the scope of this
article. This omission is intentional, as one aim of this arti-
cle is to serve as a contribution for clinicians to become
better aware of this growing area of therapeutic potential.
However, it should not be inappropriately or prematurely
used as a treatment tool for patients. As stated earlier, refer-
rals should be made to GI and nutritional professionals for
patients who may benefit from the emerging science.
Prebiotics are the nutritional substances that probiotics
require in order to survive, reproduce, and thrive. Simply
stated, prebiotics can be understood as the food upon which
probiotic microbes feast. Without proper nutrition, no organ-
ism great or small can thrive. The same holds for the micro-
organisms that reside in and on the human body. Prebiotics
that are naturally occurring in our diet are simply special
forms of indigestible fiber that are obtained from food such
as bananas, asparagus, onions, and many others (Chutkan,
2015). A critical problem is that the modern Western diet, of
which most Americans have become accustomed, fails in its
ability to provide prebiotics and adequately nourish the
microbiota of the human gut (Chutkan, 2015; Collen, 2015).
The irony lies in the fact that we are eating more than ever at
any point in history. However, the foods we are consuming
are potentially starving and destroying the microbiome that
is crucial to our physical and mental health. Thus, compre-
hensive understanding of the vitality of the human microbi-
ome and its effect on measures of health would have proper
nutrition at its core.
Implications for practice and research
The emerging evidence indicating that the state our gut can
have a significant impact on our behavior and emotion is
something that should be received and evaluated with serious
consideration for those providing mental health treatment.
Traditionally, the field of psychology has separated the mind
from the body. However, the strong bi-directional impacts
that our body and mind have on one another are becoming
ever increasingly clear. For example, we know that a stressful
event, such as an interview, an exam, or an argument, can
often lead to a whole host of physiological effects in the gut,
ranging from "butterflies" to nausea, and bouts of diarrhea, in
cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, the
stressed states of our mind may even be able to adversely
impact the composition of our vital gut microbiome.
O'Mahony etal. (2009) examined the effects of daily mater-
nal separation--a commonly accepted operationalization of
stress--in rats. Rats that experienced separation compared to
a control group demonstrated numerous stress-related out-
comes. One of the most notable outcomes was a reduction in
the diversity of the GI microbiome among rats in the experi-
mental group, compared to those in the control condition.
Conversely, as the mounting research is uncovering, commu-
nication is also occurring from the bottom up, with the gut
microbiome "talking to" the brain, consequently affecting
behavior. In a groundbreaking study, Sudo etal. (2004) pro-
vided evidence that germ-free mice have an exaggerated
physiological response to a stressful stimulus, as evidenced
by abnormal functioning of the hypothalamic­pituitary­adre-
nal axis. Once such mice were colonized with a particular
strain of bacteria that is commonly found in the GI tracts of
infants, as well as in many fermented milk products, the stress
response was reversed. Moreover, results from this study
point to the important influence that the gut microbiome has
on appropriate stress responses. Bercik etal. (2011) also dem-
onstrated the powerful effects of gut microbes on exploratory
behavior as a measure of anxiety, in two strains of germ-free
mice. BaggAlbino/c (BALB/c) mice are naturally more timid
and inhibited, compared to NIH Swiss mice, which are much
more exploratory in nature. Under controlled conditions, each
group of mice were bred germ-free and subsequently colo-
nized with microbiota from their counterparts. Results indi-
cated that after the microbial transplants from NIH Swiss
mice, BALB mice demonstrated behaviors much more char-
acteristic of their Swiss peers, including greater exploratory
behavior as well as an increase in the expression of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. In
contrast, Swiss mice demonstrated a behavioral profile simi-
lar to their anxious donors, as evidenced by an inhibition in
exploratory behavior. It is of note that the changes were not
permanent in nature but clearly demonstrated how alterations
in gut microbiota directly affect brain and behavioral func-
tioning. It is evident that with studies such as these, the com-
bined efforts of biology, neuroscience, nutrition, psychology,
and psychiatry will undoubtedly provide a more profound
understanding of communication between our "first" and
"second" brain.
Nearly all clinicians will work with patients suffering
from some form of anxiety or depression during their career.
It is not uncommon for both patients and clinicians to feel
frustrated during the therapeutic process when nearly every
psychotropic option has been exhausted, and psychological

areas of exploration appear to no longer provide valuable
insight and change. We now know there is real possibility
that something as simple as a patient's diet, history of GI ill-
ness, or chronic use of antibiotics may have significantly
imbalanced an intricate system, with direct influence on
emotion and behavior. Building on psychotherapy, and phar-
macotherapy, this third domain to treatment, involving pre-
cise nutritional evaluation and therapy may prove to be an
additional, powerful, and natural tool to help us better under-
stand and aid in the healing process of patients. Dinan etal.
(2013) discuss the potential for the development of a specific
novel class of probiotics, known as psychobiotics. They sug-
gest that these live organisms, when properly administered,
have the ability to act upon the gut­brain axis through the
production of substances that are strongly correlated with
depression and anxiety, thus aiding patients with psychiatric
conditions. Neef and Sanz (2013), as well as Bravo etal.
(2012), further support the notion that targeted food and pro-
biotic supplement usage are important areas for future clini-
cal application. The promise of psychobiotic and specialized
nutritional prescriptions may strongly resonate for clinicians
as an innovative and important aspect to treatment. However,
it is important to note that such substances and interventions
are still in the early stages of development and are not readily
available for clinical use as of yet. Undoubtedly, this area
could prove to be of great utility, as it would affect biological
processes, but without the sometimes severe and chronic
side- effects of traditional psychotropic medication.
Although not specifically employed as a psychobiotic,
Messaoudi etal. (2011) examined the effects of a probiotic
formula on several measures of behavioral and psychologi-
cal functioning, in both rat and human samples. The pre-
clinical trial demonstrated reduced anxiety-like behavior,
among rats after a 2-week ingestion of the probiotic for-
mula. However, what is more striking are the results of the
clinical trial, involving 66 human participants. In the dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects were given a
fruit bar that either contained the probiotic formula or a
placebo, for 30
days. Both the experimental and control
bars tasted the same. Results indicated that those in the
experimental condition reported significantly lower levels
of anxiety, anger, depression, and somatization, on a num-
ber of self-report measures. Lower levels of cortisol were
also evident in the experimental condition compared to the
control group. Tillisch etal. (2013) also demonstrated the
effect of a fermented milk product containing probiotics,
with significant impact on brain activity in regions control-
ling emotional and sensory processing, in healthy women.
Although researchers used a placebo-controlled design,
sample size of each condition was relatively small.
The work of Messaoudi etal. (2011), as well as Tillisch
etal. (2013), should be lauded for its inclusion of human, as
opposed to solely animal subjects, as most research in this
area lacks such a design. However, it is crucial not to over-
simplify the idea that nutritional intervention and a healthy
gut will be the panacea for profound psychological difficul-
ties. Severe mood and paralyzing anxiety disorders are not
going to be cured with probiotic yogurt and prebiotic fiber,
alone. Additional, well-controlled, double-blind, studies are
needed to investigate what particular strains of bacteria might
directly confer mental health benefits, which strains of bacte-
ria are directly related to specific emotional problems, and
how to best nourish our gut as a means to creating holistic
treatment plans for different disorders. Furthermore, as a way
to strengthen the generalizability of future findings, research
designs employing human participants will be crucial.
Conclusion
The brain­gut connection is no longer an abstract concept.
Neurobiological research has demonstrated a strong, bi-
directional communication pathway whereby two seemingly
independent organs influence each other in profound ways.
Evidence from medical science has strongly supported the
notion that unchecked stress levels exacerbate GI illnesses,
such as IBS and other digestive disorders. What is becoming
increasingly clear is that a third factor--the microbiome of
our gut--is playing a powerful role in this connection.
Mounting evidence supporting the notion of a microbiome­
gut­brain axis is not only helping us better understand the
complex underpinnings of GI illnesses, allergies, metabolic
functioning, and obesity but also providing additional clues
into untangling multifaceted psychological problems such as
depression, anxiety-based illnesses, and autistic disorders.
As both interest and technology advance, we are well on our
way to developing innovative research designs that will
potentially lead to nutritionally based and psychobiotic treat-
ments, in addition to traditional psychological and psycho-
tropic intervention. It is important to note that pure research
alone will not be enough to advance this newly discovered
territory. Practitioners must embrace the burgeoning science
not simply as an adjunct to the healing process but as a vital
third tier to the treatment they provide.
