Abstract
The Young Women's Group in Manchester is a `young women's peer health project,
run by and for young lesbian and bisexual women', which runs an allotment as one
of its activities. At a time when interest in allotments and gardening appears to be
on the increase, the existence of yet another community allotment may seem unre-
markable. Yet we suggest that this queer allotment poses challenges for conventional
theorisations of allotments, as well as for understandings of public and private. In
this article we explore how the allotment project might be understood to be
intensely engaged in `growing intimate publics', or what we term `privatepublics'.
These are paradoxical intimacies, privatepublic spaces which are not necessarily

Introduction
The Young Women's Group (YWG) is a `young women's peer health project,
run by and for young lesbian and bisexual women', based in Manchester, in the
north west of England.2 One of the youth group's activities is working an
organic allotment.3 At a time when interest in allotments and gardening appears
to be on the increase, the existence of yet another community allotment may
seem unremarkable. Yet despite the growing literature on allotments, and
increasing attention to gender, there remains little attention to the spatial
dimensions of allotment practices, particularly involving young people, and
especially young queer people. We offer a redescription of the YWG allotment,
so that, as Haraway suggests `it becomes thicker than it first seems' (Haraway
and Goodeve, 2000: 108), highlighting how the YWG allotment is an almost
unimaginable space. In so doing we explore how the allotment project might be
understood to be intensely engaged in `growing intimate publics', or what we
term `privatepublics'. These are paradoxical intimacies, privatepublic spaces
which are not necessarily made possible in the usual private sphere of domestic
homes, but which materialise on an apparently public allotment site in
Manchester. These intimate privatepublics might be understood to offer a
resourceful counter to tendencies towards privatising that which was previously
public (e.g. in processes of urban development and regeneration, often relying
on rather different public­private partnerships), whilst at the same time
appearing to bring into the public domain that which has been seen to be
private and domestic: sexuality. These growing privatepublics emerge in ways
that create intimate private spaces in the apparently public domain, necessarily
reconfiguring the boundaries of public and private. By exploring how young
lesbian and bisexual women may be marginalised in both public and private
realms, and how a focus on questions of `public' and `private' spaces can leave
questions of `nature' excluded, we understand the process of materialising an
allotment run by young lesbian and bisexual women as an `everyday utopia'
(Cooper, 2014), through which we might understand the radical possibilities of
gardening (cf. McKay, 2011).

Queering allotments
While home gardening and allotmenting garner increasing attention, young lesbian
and bisexual women have yet to figure in the literature (Bhatti and Church, 2000,
2001; Degnen, 2009; McKay, 2011). Conventionally allotments have been seen as
men's spaces, as a way to get away from the domestic, the feminine domestic; that
sheds are not only for tools ­ they are for men and cups of tea, and escaping
nagging wives (Crouch and Ward, 1988). Allotments, and sheds, have acted as a
masculine, heteronormative private sphere. Allotments have sexual politics.
Although, in their classic text, The Allotment: Its Landscape and Culture, Crouch
and Ward suggest that the stereotype of the allotment as `for men only' may never
have been entirely true, their reimagining of the allotment, that it `was always more
of a family affair than was supposed', nonetheless still seems limited (1988: 90).
Reflecting on the increasing popularity of home gardening, Bhatti and Church
(2000, 2001) identify gardens as a key site of leisure and of home-making, and one
where gender relations are played out in particular ways. Johnston and Longhurst
note that much less attention has been focussed on sexuality and gardens, with
dream homes in the suburbs being associated with nuclear families and a gendered
division of flowers (women) and vegetables (men). They describe the `Fifth Season
garden group', made up of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender gardeners, who
organised the Heroic Gardens festival in Auckland, New Zealand. They also cite an
account of a gay garden: `[t]o create a small kingdom ­ an area of sovereignty ­ has
been an essential survival strategy. More than this, it is, in some sense, a triumph.
Creating ­ as in this case, gardening ­ is how we stay sane' (Wells, 2000: 109 in
Johnston and Longhurst, 2010: 71).
But we suggest there is much more to be said about queer gardening, and many
more possibilities than heroism, or a defensive queer sovereignty. Elsewhere
Longhurst notes that gardens can both reflect and reinforce emancipatory and
oppressive power relations, noting that `[g]ardening can be a highly exclusionary
practice' (Longhurst, 2006: 590) requiring cultural capital and money, often impli-
cated in reinforcing (neo)colonial relations. Studies of allotments and community
gardens where food growing occurs have also revealed how they both challenge and
confirm power relations. In the USA research suggests that whilst community food
growing gardens can offer sites of meaning for deprived communities, these spaces
can also become aligned with neo-liberal gentrifying processes that seek to exclude
poorer residents from urban redevelopment areas. The small number of studies
that have explored gender and food growing projects have observed how these
spaces offer opportunities for women, often from low income backgrounds, to
challenge masculine approaches to gardening and enhance cultural identities
(Buckingham, 2005; Metcalf et al., 2012). However, certain practices and activities
in allotments, such as digging and growing particular products, are often pre-
scribed as male (Buckingham, 2005; Perez Vazquez, Anderson and Rogers, 2005)
and Pitt (2014) found that young women in urban South Wales still view commu-
nal food growing gardens as masculine spaces.
Moore et al. 329
If gender and sexuality are little explored with respect to gardens, or allotments,
then questions of age, and specifically of young people, are rarely addressed.
Exceptions include the ideal of children growing up in nuclear families enjoying
suburban gardens, or more recently allotment and growing projects in schools
(though here more commonly with young children than with teenagers). There is
little association of home gardening or allotmenting with young people, except
perhaps vandalism. Arguably one of gardening and allotmenting's exclusions
may be young people who are less likely to garden partly because they may lack
time, money and the access to gardening spaces (Mintel, 2007). In this sense allot-
ments appear as a queer space in which to find young people, and maybe an even
queerer space to find young queer people, reminiscent of behind the bike shed, or in
the closet. Crouch and Ward's account of the allotment as a `family affair' only
confirms that a lesbian and bisexual women's youth group appears inconceivable in
the space of the allotment. Yet the YWG allotment does exist, and here we seek to
explore what it means to materialise, to grow, a young lesbian and bisexual
women's allotment. What queer privatepublic natureculture, more-than-human,
feminist science fiction is this?
The Young Women's Group allotment
The Young Women's Group allotment is one of the activities offered as part of a
youth group for lesbian and bisexual women. The Young Women's Group (YWG)
has been running as a peer health project since 2005, meeting approximately weekly
in the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre just off the busy Oxford Road in central
Manchester. On the website, the group describes itself:
We are the Young Women's Peer Health Project run by and for young lesbian and
bisexual women. We work to improve young lesbian and bisexual women's health by
promoting various activities designed around six areas of wellness which are: physical,
emotional, intellectual, spiritual, occupational and social/community. (http://
www.likt.org.uk/)
The group offers a range of activities and projects around art and crafts, politics,
sport, and literature, and tries to respond to any requests for particular activities
from within the group.
In 2006 the Young Women's Group took on the allotment after it was given up
by a previous adult gay and lesbian (though in practice lesbian only) group which
had had the plot for a year, and which Niamh Moore had been part of. When the
YWG took over the allotment, Niamh stayed on, and with Amelia Lee, supported
young women's work at the plot. Later Claire Holmes joined and took on the work
of Allotment Co-ordinator. Involvement in the allotment (and any of the activities
the group runs) is voluntary. Young women meet at the Centre and then travel
together by bus or bike to the plot, which is about two miles south of the youth
centre. The YWG also overlaps with an LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans)
330 Feminist Theory 15(3)
youth group which meets in the same youth centre, and sometimes joins the YWG
at the allotment. The allotment is sometimes described as `LGYM Outdoors' ­ the
outdoor space for Lesbian and Gay Youth Manchester (LGYM). While the plot
was very overgrown, and initial years were spent digging and clearing the site, after
some years of perseverance it is now thriving. The allotment continues to develop
and change: it now, for example, provides produce to the community cafe
´ set up in
2013 in the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre.
Queer privatepublics
In seeking to provide an account of the YWG allotment, we take up an observation
made by Bhatti and Church, who intriguingly noted that some of their respondents
seek privacy in the garden, even though it is a semi-public space (Bhatti and
Church, 2000: 187). While allotments may seem, even more so than the garden,
to be thoroughly public spaces, we noted that there is a lot that is still private
among the brambles at the YWG allotment. This apparently contradictory finding
echoes Longhurst's turn to Gillian Rose's work on `paradoxical spaces' to describe
gardens as spaces that are `imbued with contradictions and allow for the simultan-
eous occupation of dualist categories', `troubling the binary divisions between
nature and culture, private and public, individuality and sociality, leisure and
work, and colonial and postcolonial' (Longhurst, 2006: 581­582). As we will
explain, the YWG allotment certainly seems to trouble existent understandings
of public and private. We offer privatepublics as a way into understanding the
imbrications of public and private at this site, drawing on Haraway's use of neolo-
gisms to resist dualisms. In this we echo Haraway's turn to the possibilities of
`naturecultures' to attend to how `all actors become who they are in the dance of
relating, not from scratch, not ex nihilo, but full of the patterns of their sometimes
joined, sometimes separate heritages both before and lateral to this encounter'
(Haraway, 2008: 25). Likewise we see privatepublics as drawing attention to the
ways in which public and private are categories that cannot be assumed in advance
but rather come into being in relation.
In turning to privatepublics we also seek to extend Berlant and Warner's work
on `sex in public' (1998). Berlant and Warner have highlighted the ways in which
certain privileged forms of heterosexuality have been allowed privacy while the
publicness of queer venues such as bars, saunas and clubs was called into ques-
tion for appearing to flaunt homosexuality. Their paper is not about `sex in
public' as might be commonly understood; rather they want to describe what
they `want to promote as the radical aspirations of queer culture building: not
just a safe zone for queer sex but the changed possibilities of identity, intelligi-
bility, publics, culture, and sex that appear when the heterosexual couple is no
longer the referent or the privileged example of sexual culture' (Berlant and
Warner, 1998: 548). Bhatti and Church have already alerted us to some
women's efforts to renegotiate the possibilities of privacy in the apparently
semi-public spaces of the garden: we suggest that the YWG allotment offers a
Moore et al. 331
manifestation of Berlant and Warner's queer culture building. But first we return
to the supposed public nature of allotments.
Public allotments or allotments for the public?
Allotments can seem to be thoroughly public entities. In the UK allotments are
generally provided by local councils who have a statutory responsibility to make
plots of publicly owned land available to members of the public for a small rent.
The controversy around the setting up of The New Allotment Company Ltd in
2010, a private company providing allotments on the grounds that local authorities
are not doing enough to meet public demand, suggests just how important the
notion of the `publicness' of allotments is.4 The New Allotment Company Ltd
describes allotments not as a public good, but as an extension of the private.
However, this is not framed as the extension of a private limited company into
the public domain, but rather as an extension of the domestic private: `[a]n allot-
ment is an area of land where fruits, vegetables and herbs are grown for you to eat
at home. It's really an extension of the garden and the kitchen table'.5
In this light, it is useful to briefly trace the history of the allotment. In the UK
the origins of allotments are often traced to the enclosures of common land (the
Inclosure Acts of 1750­1860); common land had been used by local people for
grazing animals and gathering timber and sometimes growing crops. Following the
Inclosure Acts, the Commons Act 1876 recognised a need for land for cultivation
by the poor. The law regarding allotments was first explicitly outlined in the Small
Holdings and Allotments Act 1908.6 Allotments might be understood as the `illegit-
imate offspring' of the enclosures (cf. Haraway, 1985), undermining the privatisa-
tion of once public, common land. In this sense then, The New Allotment
Company Ltd is merely the latest instance of the privatisation of land in the UK
(Ravenscroft, Church and Parker, 2012). Nonetheless private allotments are still
uncommon in the UK; most sites are public, provided by local councils.
Allotments, and the huge growth in interest in them, might be understood to
offer a counter to other ways of framing the city, and its rough edges, through
urban regeneration and rather different publicprivate partnerships.
Yet, for supposedly public sites, allotments are often curiously hidden away,
classically glimpsed in passing only from train windows, visible only fleetingly from
the corner of one's eye, there for a blurred second and gone again before they have
quite registered, framing the city and journeys between cities, so that you might
almost have imagined this other higgledy-piggledy world. So we suggest that allot-
ments are also intriguingly hidden publics.
Introducing young women from the youth group to the allotment often throws
up interesting questions. When one young woman, Liz, came to the allotment for
the first time, she said she had not actually known what an allotment was. She
probably wasn't the only one. So while allotments may be public, they are often
not just hidden from view, but may be utterly unknown entities for some. Initially
she seemed almost overwhelmed trying to take this new thing in, struggling to get
332 Feminist Theory 15(3)
some grasp of `it'. She asked if it was `ours', belonging to the Young Women's
Group. Niamh explained that it was rented from the council. Nonetheless she
repeated `but you mean it's ours?' The answer that the allotment was rented
from the council was clearly not the main point. This was not a notion of private
property ownership then. Rather Liz seemed to suggest that such a rambling over-
grown space could appear vast, unanticipated, unimaginable, and how little there
might be sometimes that might be `ours'; conveying a sense of a new world opening
up. She also said `it's all our own work'; implying a different kind of ownership, the
ownership of collective labour, where something is earned, created and materialised
together. It was in fact her first visit to the allotment; although not her first time to
the Young Women's Group, but she already felt that she could insert herself into
the history, and labour, of the allotment. The transformations then are not just of
the `land', but of a group transformed by the force of this encounter with a scrubby
piece of earth, reconfiguring relationships and possibilities. This quasi public
nature seemed to offer possibilities for those often excluded from both private
and public spaces; figuratively, and as we explore later, sometimes literally, home-
less. So allotments are public, but somewhat hidden from view and perhaps in the
case of the YWG allotment, still private enough.
Public, but still private (enough): On (not) being `out'
at the allotment
Being at the allotment might appear to mean being in public ­ after all, everyone
has left `home', the so-called private sphere, to be there. Although it is not clear
what public or private might mean for those young lesbian and bisexual women in
their mid to late teens and early twenties who generally (have to) inhabit someone
else's space; the allotment offers an alternative to the limits of `bedroom cultures'
(McRobbie and Garber, 1976). For many home may be neither private, nor domes-
tic, as usually understood, and at the same time young people are not always
welcomed in civic public spaces. The chaotic cosiness of the youth centre has
also been left behind, as young women travel by public transport (or bikes now)
to the allotment. Despite the appearance of being in public, not all the group
members are `out', either at home, or at the allotment. On the one hand there is
the shared unspoken out-ness, not necessary to say out loud; on the other hand
there are, for instance, conversations about going to Pride and some not going to
avoid being `seen'. In public `down the allotment' might be okay, but for some
being seen at Pride might be more risky. So there is a lot that is still private in this
hidden public among the brambles. And it's not clear what public or private means
to those who have been, or still are, in foster care or `supported' accommodation,
like The Foyer, whose name suggests a public space to be passed through briefly,
but not inhabited, not lived in, not home, not obviously much better than a closet.7
The Foyer offers `a room of one's own' to young people between the ages of sixteen
and twenty-five, who are in full-time education, though, decades later, it appears
a more cramped space than Virginia Woolf envisaged with her call for a space for
Moore et al. 333
women's writing ([1929] 2002). Certainly today's `benefits' for under twenty-fives
do not amount to 500 guineas a year. Possibly for some the allotment is as private
as it gets. Even those young people who do, or did, live in houses with gardens
(and possibly nuclear families) do not necessarily have access to the gardens.
Liz recounted that her father would not let her help in the garden; although a
few weeks later she came back and told of asking her father about whether there
was anything that could be done about the horsetails (no there was not).
The YWG allotment then is another materialisation of possibilities, beyond
homes and supported accommodation, and even beyond the youth centre,
which however necessary, also has its limits. The allotment has been called
`LGYM Outdoors' ­ Lesbian and Gay Youth Manchester Outdoors ­ in recognition
of its importance to, and relationship with, the work that goes on in the youth centre.
Albert Kennedy, Cath Hall and Joyce Layland:
Names we call home
In a city where a young gay boy died falling from a car park roof as he was chased,
where running was the only space left, it is salutary to reflect on the complexities of
home and on any easy assumptions that the bright lights of the city offer sanctuary
for LGBT people, and particularly young people. The Albert Kennedy Trust
(AKT) is named after this sixteen-year-old, who was a runaway from a children's
home in Salford. The AKT was founded in 1989, a year after Albert Kennedy's
death, by Cath Hall, a foster carer who was working with Manchester's LGBT
youth group at the time. Hall recognised the need for support for young LGBT
people who were homeless or in a housing crisis, acknowledging that neither par-
ental homes, nor so-called care homes, were necessarily adequate for the needs of
young LGBT people.8
In a city, like many other places around the world, where young people are
kicked out of home or flee before they are kicked and more (again and again); in a
city which is the supposedly safe landing point after a smuggled journey out of
`other' countries where it is not safe to be gay, it is not insignificant that the LGBT
Centre was renamed the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre, after the mother of a young
gay man who helped found the original centre.9 When her son came out to her as
gay, Joyce Layland did not kick him out of home; rather it seems that she recog-
nised her limits and perhaps also a sense of responsibility, and the needs of her son
for other safe spaces. When she found that, even in a city with a large lesbian and
gay population, there were no specific facilities for LGBT young people, she went
about setting some up. That a mother recognised that she was not enough, that
(one) home is sometimes not enough, and was not threatened by this but rather
sought to expand the places her son might call safe, is a significant story. Yet to
domesticate the youth centre as another home for young people would perhaps be
to miss part of the point; the name is intentional ­ a message to other parents that
there are options beyond kicking your child out of their home. The story of the
name of the building gets told and retold because it serves a very important
334 Feminist Theory 15(3)
political purpose. The dangers to young LGBT people are not only flying through
the air, the dangers include the multiple displacements that put young people `on
the street'. The Joyce Layland LGBT Centre offers a kind of home to young people
who may, or may not, have other options, but it also reminds parents not to make
their children homeless, and so is as much a role model, an ideal, for parents.
Just as homes are not always enough, sometimes too the youth centre is also not
enough; it is often noisy and full of chaos. The allotment offers yet another space of
possibility. The beds, and the work of weeding them while hunkered down in the
paths between, offer a cramped, constrained, but big enough space for conversa-
tions to spill out, sometimes loud and noisy and shared, sometimes quiet and low
and private, sometimes conversations that cannot quite happen in the youth centre
because there is not quite enough space there.
It was at the allotment for instance that H took out a carefully folded-up letter,
to show those present her offer of a place on a course at a local university, where
she made everyone read all the words, where she shared her excitement, hopes and
fears, about how she would be able to manage, this life that she once never ima-
gined, that was never imagined for her, that she had to work hard at to imagine
into being. And a place at university meant she would be around for at least
another three years, and be able to stay involved with the allotment. As well as
starting her university course, she also took a course at a local community garden
centre, so that she could learn more about growing vegetables organically.
So it was quite a shock when she announced she was getting an allotment of her
own. Such apparent individualism seemed so contrary to the ethos of a collective
project. But H's new plot was adjacent to the YWG plot. It was less about cutting
ties and going it alone, than stretching one's toes just a little, growing into a more
expansive project. And in any case, it was like the YWG plot at the beginning, huge
and hugely overgrown, so the plan was to share tools and labour and help her clear
it. And, after all, Claire, the Allotment Co-ordinator, and Niamh actually had
allotments of their `own'; though these were with partners and friends. Indeed,
Claire gave up her plot at another site and got one just along from the YWG
allotment to make it easier to work both plots. While Niamh moved house and
got an allotment elsewhere, she still `came back', even though this meant a two to
three hour round trip by inconvenient trains and buses, or a twenty-mile bike ride
each way. So an allotment of one's own was hardly about cutting ties with the
YWG allotment (perhaps more a desire for vegetables of our own, for even more
possibilities of growing), and the boundaries between plots not so distinct as tools,
seeds and labour are shared back and forth. These boundaries were made literally
even more fluid one day when a plan for a day's solid digging was undone. When H
arrived she found hundreds of tadpoles swimming in an inch of water in the creases
of a sheet of plastic covering the ground of her plot. There had been a plan for the
day, but it unravelled in the moments of standing around the sheet of plastic in the
rare burning sun in Manchester, silently watching the teeming life, and contemplat-
ing what had been plotted for the day, and what to do now, as if there was
any decision to make. Then two were sent off to get a pond liner while everyone
Moore et al. 335
else dug a pond on the putative borders of the plots, moved by the `significant
otherness' (Gabb, 2011) of the tadpoles still wriggling furiously in the water.
Queer naturecultures
In turning to privatepublics to understand allotment life we are referencing Donna
Haraway's `naturecultures'. Our aim here is to draw attention to the ways in which
privatepublics and naturecultures are entangled. A focus on public/private dualism,
with private signalling the domestic, and public often conjuring up civic, urban
spaces, has often meant that nature disappears from consideration. Yet the queer-
naturecultures of the allotment bring privatepublics back into view.
David Bell's (2010) account of `queernaturecultures' includes the utopian pastor-
alism of Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter, as well as lesbian separatist com-
munes, radical faeries, and phenomena such as the popularity of the film Brokeback
Mountain (2005) and the practice of dogging. Histories of lesbian land, of les-
bian separatist communities, of efforts to make space for women and a relationship
with land, can be considered part of the genealogy of the YWG allotment
(Munt, 1998; Sandilands, 2002; Shugar, 1995; Valentine, 1997). Such versions of
queer natures are often counters to assumptions that cities offer the appropriate
liberatory space for gay politics, against the supposed conservatism of the rural.
One of the ongoing challenges for feminists and queers is the apparently
doubled-nature of nature. Nature has been understood as that which is other
than human, as the non-human. Yet nature is also that which is precisely the
essence of being human, as in `human nature'. For feminists questions of
`women's nature' have often become more troubling when women are seen to be
`in' or `for' nature. Thus lesbian separatists creating lesbian land are often held up
as paradigmatic essentialists, even while they are engaged in the intense labour of
building women's culture. Similarly when feminists are also environmentalists,
not only `in' nature, but `for' nature, they too are often vilified as essentialists,
as eco/feminists have discovered to their cost (Moore, 2014).
Haraway's work, and that of (other) eco/feminists, has been useful for troubling
any notion that humans are separate from nature, or that human nature might be
best understood as about deterministic essences. Haraway directly addressed the
question of nature in `The Promises of Monsters: A Regenerative Politics for
Inappropriate/d Others', where she proposed that `nature is made, but not entirely
by humans; it is a co-construction among humans and non-humans' (1992: 298).
She argued:
So, nature is not a physical place to which one can go, nor a treasure to fence in or
bank, nor as essence to be saved or violated. Nature is not hidden and so does not
need to be unveiled. Nature is not a text to be read in the codes of mathematics and
biomedicine. It is not the `other' who offers origin, replenishment, and service. Neither
mother, nurse, nor slave, nature is not matrix, resource, or tool for the reproduction of
man. [. . .] Nature is also a tropos, a trope. It is figure, construction, artifact,
336 Feminist Theory 15(3)
movement, displacement. Nature cannot pre-exist its construction. [. . .] Nature is a
topic of public discourse on which much turns, even the earth. (Haraway, 1992: 296)
Haraway usefully implodes any separation of nature and culture, alongside any
notion of nature's passivity ­ while insisting that the public is a key site for rework-
ing nature/s.
This attention to the public is taken up in David Bell's (2010) use of `queer-
naturecultures' to address `the nature of our sexual natures' (Weeks, 1991: 86, cited
in Bell, 2010: 134), to think through the nature of sex and the sex of nature. While
the focus here is on questions of sexuality, rather than sex per se, Bell's work clearly
remains pertinent. Both Haraway and Bell pick up on the questions of publics.
Haraway suggests, perhaps counter-intuitively for some, that nature is `the place to
rebuild public culture' (1992: 296). Bell concludes his reflections on queernature-
cultures with a series of questions: what does it mean to talk about the publicness
of nature? And if we can speak of more-than-human publics, what does that mean
for the politics of nature and the politics of sex (Bell, 2010: 144)? While Bell is
addressing the naturalisation of sex, alongside its `relegation' to the private sphere,
here we focus on the limits of the public, through suggesting how allotments undo
neat distinctions between public and private, nature and culture, rural and urban,
domestic and civic.
Growing intimate privatepublic naturecultures:
The YWG allotment as `everyday utopia'
So what does it mean to materialise, to grow, a young lesbian and bisexual
women's allotment? What queer privatepublic natureculture, more-than-human,
feminist science fiction is this? We suggest here that it means to make something
up, to imagine something into being that does not exist, or only barely exists,
threatening to disappear any second. The allotment might be seen as a site of
what Davina Cooper terms `everyday utopia' ­ `sites and spaces which aspire to
accomplish some routine aspect of social life in a more democratic, equal or freer
fashion'.
There is little explicitly said within the Young Women's Group about what a
lesbian and bisexual women's allotment might mean. But the process of producing
YouTube videos as part of a research project allowed new conversations to
emerge.10 In the YouTube videos there is a repetition of the allotment as a space
apart from the stress of other daily life, which, for a few hours, recedes; a space for
regeneration all round. Typical of this is the following exchange between four
young women in a focus group after the making of the videos, in response to a
prompt about what about the allotment makes them happy:
I think it makes me a lot happier when I go to do other things. Like it's like a thing at
the end of the week like. It's fine, I can do all of this hard work' cause I'll get to spend
four hours on the allotment on some days.
Moore et al. 337
It's very therapeutic. So like weeding and weeding [all laugh] and yes, more weeding
[all laugh] and, you know, just kind of just getting really stuck in. I think it gives you
that head space where, you know, you're able to kind of relieve maybe some kind of
troubles and then you come out feeling refreshed, renewed and ready to carry on.
I think it's like for me, it gives me that sense of having a group which I feel comfort-
able in and kind of that whole thing of community or our own little community . . . it
makes me happy [laughs].
In this conversation there are the `shadows' of other aspects of lives, other
worlds, which do not appear to be so nourishing. Ecofeminist philosopher,
Val Plumwood, used the term `shadow places' to reference north/south inequal-
ities. Plumwood was reworking the grounding of environmental ethics in a
reified `sense of place', and suggested that what was needed in its stead was
`an ethic of place' (see also de la Bellacasa, 2012). She suggested that the reifi-
cation of place in much environmental discourse requires the privileging of one's
own place and relationships, at the expense of other `hidden places' (Plumwood,
2008). Plumwood asked whether
discourses of place and belonging marginalise denied, dislocated and dispossessed
identities, privileging `the self-identical and well-rooted ones who have natural
rights and stable homes'? (Haraway, 1997: 215; Plumwood, 2002: 23). Is the ability
to maintain access (unproblematically) to a special homeplace and to protect it not at
least partly a function of one's privilege/power in the world. (2008: 140)
Given Plumwood's attention to interlocking matrices of oppression, she would
likely not have objected to using shadow places to think through the implications
of heteronormative places and their shadow lands. Indeed such an account is
implicit in her commentary on the recent attention to the figure of the child:
I am not of course arguing that there's necessarily anything wrong with loving a
special place, or that justice demands that we each love and care for all places equally,
any more than it requires one love one's child only as much as all other children and
no more. But justice does require that we take some account of other children, and of
our own and our child's relationship to them, perhaps even that we not aim to have
our child thrive at the expense of these other children. (Plumwood, 2008: 147)
This version of an ecofeminist maternal ethic of care offers something quite other
than `reproductive futurism' (Edelman, 2004). With her call for more multiple
relationships to place against a `monogamous ideal' (Plumwood, 2008: 147) of
relationships with singular and special places, Plumwood's ecofeminist ethic and
politics of place was already queer. It is the kind of queer ethic of place/home which
Joyce Layland articulated and which is carried on in the visionary practices of
professional youth and community workers like Sally Carr, Claire Holmes,
338 Feminist Theory 15(3)
Amelia Lee and many others who continue Joyce Layland's work. As feminists
have long noted, home is a difficult space for many women. As Caren Kaplan
articulates it:
We must leave home, as it were, because our homes are often the sites of sexism,
racism, and other damaging social practices. Where we come to locate ourselves in
terms of our specific histories and differences must be a place with room for what can
be salvaged from the past and what can be made new. What we gain is a reterritor-
ialization; we reinhabit a world of our making. (1987: 194)
Eco/feminists might stress that the `our' of `a world of our making' is not all
human.
This everyday utopia offers not a reified sense of place, but as Davina Cooper
has articulated:
the movement of members between everyday utopias and a wide array of other
sites ­ indeed the interwoven character of the sites themselves in their multiple
entangled relationships to other places and process ­ highlights a crucial dimension
of everyday utopias. Far from offering totalizing expressions of what an ideal self-
sufficient life could be, everyday utopias are more akin to hot spots of innovative
practice. (2014: 9)
The YWG allotment was never intended to sustain a nuclear family of four. It is
not even clear if the plot has managed to sustain the hedgehog that came to the
allotment from a hedgehog sanctuary (though, more precisely, it was never likely
that the hedgehog needed us in any case, but we hope he is living happily some-
where amongst the undergrowth). For a long time, it was not possible to pretend
that the vegetables were sustaining anyone, although the idea, the promise, of
vegetables, gathered young and older women together at the allotment, even
those who say on video that they `don't like veg', for the hard work of digging,
and digging, and more digging. Nonetheless, the ambitions for the plot change and
grow, from being `LGYM Outdoors', to bringing fruit and vegetables back to the
Centre and cooking and eating together; to supporting the new Sidney Street
Community Cafe11 and creating opportunities for training and employment; to a
rearticulation of the work at the allotment as a transgenerational project; and a
transformed notion of the interconnections which might be community.
In seeking to create alternatives to Manchester's gay scene, not only spaces for
young people, but also alternatives to the scene, the YWG, and the allotment, offer
a manifestation of Berlant and Warner's call for a queer culture that would make
room for `the development of kinds of intimacy that bear no necessary relation to
domestic space, to kinship, to the couple form, to property, or to the nation'
(Berlant and Warner, 1998: 558). We suggest that the YWG allotment offers a
queer eco/feminist re-vision (cf. Rich, 1979) of Virginia Woolf's A Room of
One's Own (Woolf, 2002), anticipated by Alice Walker in In Search of Our
Moore et al. 339
Mothers' Gardens (Walker, 1983). This vision pushes the possibilities of a room of
one's own, of a garden of one's own, even of Our Bodies, Ourselves (Boston
Women's Health Collective, 1973), to encompass an allotment, and a demand
for a whole joined up planet, a queer ethic of place, a worlding of privatepublic
naturecultures. A world where, for a short while, the blur of the allotment from the
train window is reversed and the view from, and the experience of, the allotment
allows a recentring, so the rest of the world, the rest of the week, a shadow world,
temporarily recedes into the corner of one's eye, and for a while a different world,
an everyday utopia of an almost unimaginable intimate privatepublic naturecul-
ture, comes into being.

Young Women's Group, which resulted in two YouTube videos, `I love you allot' and
`Spearmint? I'll have some of that!', available at: http://www.likt.org.uk/activities/allot-
ment/; and a focus group with twelve young women, all of whom had gardened at the
allotment on at least one occasion, and most of whom were regulars at the allotment.
The focus group, which took place at the Platt Chapel Community Centre in
Manchester in June 2011, was facilitated by Amelia Lee, a youth worker trained in
group facilitation methods (ICA-UK's Technology of Participation) who worked regu-
larly with the young women. Andrew Church, Niamh Moore, Neil Ravenscroft and
Paul Gilchrist, another researcher based at the University of Brighton, were also present
at the focus group, but did not actively participate.
