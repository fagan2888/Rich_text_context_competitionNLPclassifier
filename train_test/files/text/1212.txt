Racial Differences in Glaucoma Care
The Longitudinal Pattern of Care
Jan Ostermann, PhD; Frank A. Sloan, PhD; Leon Herndon, MD; Paul P. Lee, MD, JD
Objective: To examine if racial differences exist in lon-
gitudinal care patterns for Medicare beneficiaries with
glaucoma.
Methods: We analyzed national longitudinal Medicare
claims data from January 1, 1991, through December 31,
1999 in 21 644 Medicare beneficiaries linked to the Na-
tional Long-Term Care Survey. Logistic regression was
used to predict whether a person underwent an eye ex-
amination or eye surgery during the year, and negative
binomial regression was used to predict the number of
eye examinations and surgical procedures for glaucoma
per year. Annual use of eye examinations was nearly iden-
tical for black persons (1.85 per year) and white per-
sons (1.89 per year), whereas surgery rates were higher
among blacks (0.15) than whites (0.08, P.001).
Results: Blacks were more likely than whites to have glau-
coma diagnosed, but rates among whites were higher than
in prior population-based studies. When we controlled
for other factors, blacks were not significantly less likely
to undergo eye examination during the year; however,
blacks were 78% more likely to undergo surgery
(P  .001) and had 76% higher rates of surgical proce-
dures (P  .001).
Conclusions: No systematic pattern was found of un-
deruse among blacks relative to whites after glaucoma di-
agnosis. Higher rates of surgery among blacks may indi-
cate delayed onset of care and/or greater disease severity.

RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE
provision of health care ser-
vices have been a relatively
unexploredtopicineyecare
services, whereas they have
received prominent attention in other fields
ofmedicineandhealthcare.Withineyecare,
study results demonstrated that black per-
sons have a rate of utilization of glaucoma
services that is more than twice that of the
white population.1-3 This result has been
compared with estimates from population-
based studies of glaucoma prevalence in
whichprevalenceamongblackswas4times
higher than among whites, leading to the
conclusion that glaucoma is undertreated
in blacks.1,4-7 Growing evidence of under-
treatment in blacks and other minorities in
other health arenas,8-14 especially surgical
services, is consistent with this concern of
a potential disparity in access to and use of
eye care services for glaucoma.
The authors of these prior studies used
cross-sectional estimates of care for the
Medicare population during 1 year's course
of care. In this study, we examined whether
differences in care patterns exist on a lon-
gitudinal basis for individuals with glau-
coma enrolled in the Medicare program.
First, we determined whether the rate of di-
agnosis of glaucoma according to race com-
portswiththemostrecentestimatesbyPre-
vent Blindness America and the National
Eye Institute.15 Second, we investigated
whether longitudinal care patterns, once
glaucoma is diagnosed, vary according to
race. In this way, we can begin to deter-
mine better the extent of racial disparities
in access to and use of care, as well as in in-
tensity of care after individuals gain access
to the health care system.
METHODS
The initial study population consisted of a na-
tionally representative sample of 21 644 Medi-
care beneficiaries who were studied previ-
ously to estimate prevalence of glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy (DR), and age-related
macular degeneration (ARMD).16 The sample
was nationally representative of Medicare ben-
eficiaries chosen for purposes of conducting the
National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), a
longitudinal study of elderly persons, during
1982 and 1984 and every 5 years through 1999.
The data are available on a restricted use ba-
sis; we obtained Duke University's Institu-
tional Review Board and US Centers for Medi-

care and Medicaid Services' approval for use of the data for this
study.
To obtain the analysis sample of 21 644 beneficiaries for this
study, we performed the following steps. In brief, beginning
with a sample of 41 931 beneficiaries who appeared in the data
for at least part of the period from 1982 through 1999, we ex-
cluded persons who died before 1991. This exclusion resulted
in a loss of 11 023 individuals. We next eliminated 8238 indi-
viduals who were younger than 65 years in 1991. We then re-
moved 573 individuals who died between January 1 and June
30, 1991, for whom we had fewer than 6 months of claims data.
Of the remaining sample, we were unable to match 98 indi-
viduals to 1991 through 1999 Medicare enrollment records for
unknown reasons; 338 individuals also had incomplete enroll-
ment data (missing data for 1 or more years) between 1991 and
1999. Finally, we removed 17 individuals with duplicate and
conflicting enrollment records, leaving us with a net eligible
sample of 21 644 Medicare beneficiaries.
The only loss in sample after the beginning of 1991 was be-
cause of death or health maintenance organization (HMO) en-
rollment. The sample of 21 644 persons was further reduced
in those years in which the person was enrolled in a Medicare
HMO for more than 6 months in a particular year. For ex-
ample, if a beneficiary was enrolled in an HMO for more than
6 months during 1993 but was in an HMO for less time than
this in the other years, the person would have been excluded
from the analysis sample only in 1993. This adjustment was
necessary because Medicare did not receive information about
utilization of services of beneficiaries in HMOs until after 1999.
Information about whether a beneficiary belonged to an HMO
each month was obtained from separate Medicare enrollment
files. The number of persons excluded from the analysis be-
cause of HMO enrollment varied each year and ranged from
1319 in 1991 to 2193 in 1999. We followed up persons through
2000, but no persons diagnosed as having glaucoma were added
to the original sample after 1999 to allow for at least 1 year of
follow-up data.
To identify persons with glaucoma, we searched for glau-
coma-specific diagnosis codes in the Medicare claims data
(Table 1, Panel A). Persons entered the sample in the year
after diagnosis, but not before 1991, the first year in which di-
agnosis codes were available in Medicare physician carrier data.
We identified medical records of eye examinations and surgi-
cal procedures performed for glaucoma treatment by using Cur-
rent Procedural Terminology and International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) pro-
cedure codes (Table 1, Panel B). We identified the individual's
race from Medicare vital statistics information linked to our data
set. We excluded 685 persons (3.2%) who were not explicitly
classified as either black or white.
Each person entered the database repeatedly every year af-
ter the year of diagnosis until 2000 or death, whichever oc-
curred first. We calculated annual prevalence as the number
of persons with glaucoma diagnosed before year end, divided
by the total number of persons, excluding those alive for fewer
than 6 months or those covered by Medicare HMOs for more
than 6 months during the year.
Oursampleyielded353blacks(8.9%)and3598whites(91.1%)
with glaucoma diagnosed, for at least 1 year from 1992 through
2000, including those persons with codes for suspected glau-
coma status (Table 2). On average, we observed black persons
for 5.5 years and white persons for 5.7 years (P = .11). Annual
rates of eye examinations for persons diagnosed with glaucoma
werenearlyidenticalforblacks(1.85peryear)andforwhites(1.89
per year) (P=.51). However, blacks were more likely than whites
tohavenoeyeexaminationduringtheyear(42.5%,blacks;33.6%,

a prior diagnosis of some form of glaucoma had no eye exami-
nation during the entire observational period from 1991 through
2000 (P  .001). Of persons without an eye examination, 23.1%
of blacks and 27.4% of whites were suspected of having glau-
coma (P=.42, data not shown).
Rates of surgical procedures for glaucoma were almost twice
as high for blacks as for whites (0.15 surgical procedures per

person per year for blacks compared with 0.08 surgical proce-
dures per person per year for whites P  .001). Furthermore,
blacks with a diagnosis of glaucoma were more likely to have
surgery during the entire observational period, as well as in any
given year.
Most of the explanatory variables were based on data from
Medicare claims and enrollment files. Information about some
demographic characteristics, functional status, insurance, and
income came from the 1989, 1994, and 1999 waves of the
NLTCS, which was merged with the Medicare claims file. We
used information from the NLTCS interview nearest to the ob-
servational year. For example, for 1991, we used 1989 data from
NLTCS; for 1993, we used 1994 NLTCS data.
We used logistic regression to predict whether a person un-
derwent eye examination or eye surgery during the year and
negative binomial regression to predict the number of eye ex-
aminations and surgical procedures for glaucoma per year
(STATA version 7.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).17 Co-
variates and their distribution according to race are shown in
Table 3. P.05 was considered statistically significant.
Black race was the main covariate of interest. Other covar-
iates were as follows: diagnosis of glaucoma (suspected glau-
coma--omitted reference group, primary open-angle glau-
coma [POAG], narrow-angle glaucoma, other), ability to read
newsprint with or without glasses, other ocular comorbidi-
ties--DR (background, proliferative, unspecified), cataract,
ARMD (dry, wet, unspecified), death during the year, death dur-
ing the next year, number of complications from diabetes (count
of ICD-9-CM 250.xx codes), diagnosed dementia, DxCG score
(measure of case mix severity based on all diagnoses/
procedures recorded in claims in the year before the observa-
tional year),18 age, male sex, years of schooling, family in-
come, number of limitations in activities of daily living, marital
status, children living in the elderly person's home, children
living within an hour of the elderly person but not in the home,
Medigap coverage, number of months during the year the per-
son was enrolled in Medicaid, number of months during the
year the person was enrolled in an HMO, number of ophthal-
mologists in the primary sampling unit per capita, standard met-
ropolitan statistical area or county for persons not living in a
standard metropolitan statistical area, number of optometrists
per capita in the primary sampling unit, nonresidence in a stan-
dard metropolitan statistical area, living in nursing home, and
binary variables for each year. We included interactions be-
tween glaucoma and diagnoses of other major eye diseases--
cataract, ARMD, and diabetes mellitus. In some specifica-
tions, we also included interaction terms for black race and years
since year of first diagnosis of glaucoma but excluded these co-
variates from the results presented because they did not alter
the results. When information for a variable from NLTCS was
not available, we set the variable to zero and included a binary
variable to identify the value as missing. Standard errors were
adjusted for repeated observations in the same individuals.
RESULTS
There were statistically significant differences between
white and black persons in the prevalence of eye dis-
eases (Table 3). A greater percentage of blacks had POAG
or narrow-angle glaucoma, diabetes, DR, and complica-
tions from diabetes and reported having difficulty read-

ing newsprint. Blacks were less likely to have other forms
of glaucoma (suspected glaucoma, the omitted refer-
ence group, and other glaucoma), cataracts, and ARMD.
Compared with white persons in the sample, black per-
sons were slightly older (1 year on average) and were
more likely to be female, live in urban areas, be less edu-
cated, have a lower income, be less likely to be married,
be more likely to have children living within 1 hour dis-
tance, and have more comorbidities. Black persons were
also more likely to have a diagnosis of dementia, re-
ported more limitations in activities of daily living, were
less likely to be in a nursing home, and were more likely
to die during any given year.
Rates of diagnosed glaucoma among those who sur-
vived the year increased over time for both blacks and
whites (Table 4). Rates for blacks increased from 11.2%
in 1991 to 32.9% in 1999, whereas those for whites in-
creased from 8.8% to 26.0%. Prevalence was signifi-
cantly higher among blacks in all 3 years (P  .01 in 1991
and P  .001 in 1995 and 1999). Prevalence of POAG
in blacks relative to whites was 1.6 in 1991 (7.5% vs 4.7%,
P  .001). As the cohort aged, the ratios of black to white
glaucoma prevalence increased to 1.44 in 1995 and 1.46
in 1999. Rates of narrow-angle glaucoma were higher
among blacks than whites (P  .01 in 1995 and 1999),
but there were no statistically significant differences in
prevalence of other and suspected glaucoma.
Having other major eye diseases in combination with
glaucoma may not only complicate therapy but also lead
to poorer visual outcomes on average than having glau-
coma alone. Joint prevalence of glaucoma and DR was
the same for blacks as for whites in 1991, but the joint
prevalence of glaucoma and DR increased substantially
thereafter (Table 5). By 1999, 11.1% of blacks with glau-
coma also had DR diagnosed, compared with 5.4% for
whites. Joint prevalence of glaucoma and ARMD and joint
prevalence of glaucoma, DR, and ARMD were generally
lower for blacks than for whites, but the differences were
not statistically significant at conventional levels.
In the second phase of the study, we examined use of
eye care services conditional on a diagnosis of glau-
coma. The purpose of limiting this analysis to persons
with diagnosed glaucoma was to obtain a better sense of
whether racial disparities existed in the provision of ser-
vices after initial access barriers were overcome and blacks
entered the health care system with a diagnosis of some
form of glaucoma.
Blacks with glaucoma (including suspected glau-
coma) diagnosed were 32% (P  .001) less likely to un-
dergo eye examination during the year, not accounting
for other factors likely to affect use (Table 6). Control-
ling for the other covariates reduced this difference in
half to 16% (P=.09). Thus, it appears that more blacks
than whites were likely to be sporadic in their care pat-
terns, and the nearly identical mean annual utilization
rates (Table 2) suggest that blacks who received care did
so in a more intense fashion.
Blacks were 88% more likely to have eye surgery for
glaucoma during a year than were whites (P  .001).
When we controlled for other covariates, the difference
remained high--64% (P  .001). Rates of eye examina-
tions were not significantly different between blacks and
whites, whereas rates of surgery were 83% higher for
blacks than for whites diagnosed as having glaucoma with-

out other covariates included in the analysis and 62%
higher with other covariates included (P  .001).
The relationship between race and eye examinations
and surgical procedures was similar when we restricted
the analysis to persons with POAG diagnosed (Table 7).
When we did not control for covariates, blacks with POAG
were 36% less likely to undergo any eye examination dur-
ing a given year but 75% more likely to undergo surgery
(P  .001). Controlling for the other factors changed the
differences to ­17% (P=.20) and 78% (P  .001). As with
glaucoma patients overall, there was no difference be-
tween blacks and whites in the mean number of annual
examinations, but surgery rates were 71% to 76% higher
for blacks than whites (P  .001).
COMMENT
Blacks were more likely than whites to have a diagnosis
of glaucoma. However, our study estimates of preva-
lence according to race demonstrated a lower ratio than
expected of diagnosed glaucoma in blacks than in whites
among those 65 years and older.1,5 The rate of suspected
glaucoma was lower for blacks than whites at all inter-
vals as the cohort of survivors grew older. If patients with
a definite POAG diagnosis are combined with those sus-
pected of having glaucoma, the ratio of rates for blacks
to whites decreases further below the 1.8 ratio esti-
mated by Prevent Blindness America; the race-specific es-
timates and ratios from the Baltimore Eye Survey, which
exceed 4 in the Medicare age group; and ratios from other
studies.5,15,19-21
The longitudinal ratio of glaucoma diagnosis rates
among blacks compared with that among whites was less
than that estimated in cross-sectional studies. Unlike the
authors of studies in which cross-sectional data were used
to demonstrate differences in rates of diagnosis relative
to population-based estimates,1,5,19 we longitudinally fol-
lowed up a nationally representative cohort of persons
65 years and older to estimate these rates of glaucoma
(particularly POAG) diagnosis. Our analysis revealed
lower glaucoma diagnosis rates among blacks in gen-
eral, and of POAG in particular, than did analyses in ear-
lier studies.
The present study, moreover, also provides some in-
sights into why this shortfall relative to the expected ra-
tiomightormightnotbeanimportantproblem.Thepreva-
lence rates among blacks in this cohort, whose average age
was in the middle to high 80s by 2000, increased to more
than 30%, an expected level based on findings in the Bar-
bados Eye Study population.22 In contrast, relative to find-
ingsintheBaltimoreEyeSurvey,19 rateswerenearly3times
higheramongblacks,andtheywerealmost10timeshigher
among whites in our study relative to the Barbados Eye
Study22; the resulting ratio is less than might be expected
from results of either previous study. Whether this find-
ing represents overdiagnosis among whites or underdiag-
nosis among blacks, or both, cannot be answered from our
data. In fact, it may be neither of these but a manifesta-
tion of the longitudinal nature of our study--as opposed
to findings with cross-sectional estimates--and the larger
sample sizes involved in this study relative to those in the
population-based studies. (The Baltimore Eye Survey19 in-
cluded only 11 black and 4 white patients with definite
POAG cases among persons 80 years and older.) At a mini-
mum, our estimates provide an alternative estimate of
prevalence rates.
Finally, as noted in an earlier study,16 the influence of
usingphysician-baseddiagnosticcriteriaasopposedtospe-
cific study criteria may affect our reported rates, so it is less
certain whether there is a significant degree of underdiag-
nosis of glaucoma among blacks. The study results sug-
gest that it would be worth examining actual rates of glau-
coma diagnosis to determine if access is being garnered in
the health care system so that diagnoses can be made.
Our study results also indicate that there are 2 dis-
tinct groups once blacks have received a diagnosis of glau-
coma. First, there is a group that does not obtain access
to regular care, as is evident by the larger share of black
individuals without annual examinations. There is, how-
ever, also a second group for whom the rate of visits to

the Medicare physician and service use (especially sur-
gical) is at least as great as, if not greater than, that of
whites. The rates of surgery are much higher among blacks
on per person and subpopulation bases, confirming the
direction of findings in earlier cross-sectional studies.
In our study, blacks were much more likely to un-
dergo glaucoma surgery once they had glaucoma diag-
nosed. Compared with authors of previous cross-
sectional studies, we were able to monitor surgical use
per person across time. Thus, in contrast to conclusions
of prior studies such as that of Wang et al,5 our conclu-
sions do not indicate a lower rate than expected of glau-
coma surgery among blacks with glaucoma; instead, we
found a higher rate among blacks, so we cannot draw any
significant conclusions about underservice.
Higher rates of glaucoma surgery reported for blacks in
our study most likely reflect the greater clinical severity of
diseaseamongblacks.Although,toourknowledge,therec-
ommendation of surgery according to race has not been
studied within ophthalmology, research in other fields of
medicine suggests that blacks are less likely than whites
to be offered invasive or surgical therapies.23,24 To the ex-
tent that this result generalizes to ophthalmology, there is
the implication that the higher rates of surgery for blacks
in our study reflect greater clinical severity of glaucoma for
blacks than for whites at diagnosis. Unfortunately, we did
not have direct information about the clinical severity of
glaucoma among black patients.
The results of this study demonstrate the value of lon-
gitudinal data for learning about the roles of race and other
demographic factors in use of health services. Because
of the relatively larger sample sizes of individuals in the
older age cohorts compared with those in population-
based studies, rate estimates may be robust in different
ways in longitudinal than in population-based studies.
Counterbalanced against this gain is the loss of preci-
sion of disease definition. However, prevalence and in-
cidence estimates from this study population provide es-
timates similar to those in population-based studies for
glaucoma,16 suggesting that this case identification is-
sue may not be overly problematic.
In conclusion, the present study results demonstrate
that, to the extent possible with administrative data, no
clear pattern of significant undertreatment of glaucoma
among blacks exists. Although the ratio of diagnosed cases
in blacks compared with that in whites is lower than ex-
pected from the Baltimore Eye Survey,19 there is a some-
what surprising finding in that the rate of glaucoma among
the white population is relatively much higher, which re-
duces the ratio. Additional investigation as to the clini-
cal severity of disease and the resulting influences on pat-
terns of care are the next step. We hope that other
investigators also will pursue these studies.
