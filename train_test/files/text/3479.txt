ABSTRACT
Malignant gliomas are primary brain tumors characterized by
morphological and genetic complexities, as well as diffuse in-
filtration into normal brain parenchyma. Within gliomas, mi-
croglia/macrophages represent the largest tumor-infiltrating
cell population, contributing by at least one-third to the to-
tal tumor mass. Bi-directional interactions between glioma
cells and microglia may therefore play an important role on
tumor growth and biology. In the present study, we have
characterized the influence of glioma-soluble factors on mi-
croglial function, comparing the effects of media harvested
under basal conditions with those of media obtained after
inducing a pro-inflammatory activation state in glioma cells.
We found that microglial cells undergo a different pattern of
activation depending on the stimulus; in the presence of ac-
tivated glioma-derived factors, i.e. a condition mimicking the
late stage of pathology, microglia presents as a mixture of
polarization phenotypes (M1 and M2a/b), with up-regulation
of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), ARG (arginase) and
IL (interleukine)-10. At variance, microglia exposed to basal
glioma-derived factors, i.e. a condition resembling the early
stage of pathology, shows a more specific pattern of ac-
tivation, with increased M2b polarization status and up-
regulation of IL-10 only. As far as viability and cell prolifer-

ation are concerned, both LI-CM [LPS (lipopolysaccharide)­
IFN (interferon ) conditioned media] and C-CM (control-
conditioned media) induce similar effects on microglial mor-
phology. Finally, in human glioma tissue obtained from sur-
gical resection of patients with IV grade glioblastoma, we
detected a significant amount of CD68 positive cells, which
is a marker of macrophage/microglial phagocytic activity,
suggesting that in vitro findings presented here might have
a relevance in the human pathology as well.

INTRODUCTION
Primary brain tumors represent approximately 2% of all adult
neoplasia; of these, most common phenotype is the high-
grade malignant glioma (grade III­IV by the World Health
Organization) (Wen and Kesari, 2008). Malignant gliomas
are primary CNS (central nervous system) tumors, originat-
ing from glial cells and characterized by morphological and
genetic complexity as well as diffuse infiltration of tumor
cells into the normal brain parenchyma (Rolle et al., 2012).

L. Lisi and others
Current therapeutic strategies (i.e., aggressive surgical resec-
tion combined with radiation and chemotherapy) are largely
ineffective; patients have a life expectancy of 14 months
from the initial diagnosis of GBM (glioblastoma multiforme),
the most aggressive glioma type of tumor (Stupp et al., 2005,
2009). In fact, malignant gliomas remain at present among
the most lethal cancers (for a recent review Bradley and Rees,
2014), and this underscores the need for novel and more ef-
fective therapeutic approaches.
It has been widely shown that gliomas are histologically
heterogeneous tumors, containing cancerous cells mostly de-
rived from astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but also stro-
mal cells and a significant amount of different inflammatory
cells; the latter have been found to significantly contribute
to glioma cell growth and progression (Charles et al., 2012).
Among tumor-infiltrating cells, microglia/macrophages rep-
resent the largest population of cells, contributing to at least
one-third of the total tumor mass (Carvalho da Fonseca and
Badie, 2013). The percentage of microglia within the tu-
mor positively correlates with the tumor grade, with the
highest proportion (78%) found in proliferative and high-
grade glioma (Roggendorf et al., 1996). Furthermore, the
abundance of microglia is also positively related to can-
cer invasiveness (Markovic et al., 2005). In the last decade,
a large number of experimental studies provided evidence
for a tumor-supporting role of microglia; on the opposite,
data in support of microglial anti-tumor properties have also
been reported (Li and Graeber, 2012). Interestingly, the group
of Seyfried hypothesized that some neoplastic cells within
the GBM arise from the transformed macrophage/microglia
(Huysentruyt et al, 2011), further suggesting the tumor-
supporting hypothesis of microglia. However, the exact role
of microglia in the biology of malignant gliomas remain to
be fully elucidated (Zhai et al., 2011).
Under pathological conditions microglia do not consti-
tute a uniform cell population, but rather comprise a family
of cells with diverse phenotypes, which may be associated to
beneficial or, on the contrary, to detrimental biological activ-
ities (Schwartz et al., 2006). Microglial-activated cells can be
broadly divided into classically activated M1 cells, with cy-
totoxic properties and alternatively activated M2 cells, with
phagocytic activities. Furthermore, the M2 activation can be
further divided into three classes: M2a, involved in repair
and regeneration; M2b, an immune-regulatory phenotype;
or M2c, an acquired-deactivating phenotype (Chhor et al.,
2013). Each of these distinct microglia phenotypes has spe-
cific inducers: Toll-like receptor-4 agonist LPS (lipopolysac-
charide), IFN (interferon ) and TNF (tumor necrosis factor
) for M1; IL (interleukine)-4 and IL-13 for M2a; immune
complexes and toll-like receptor agonists, as well as IL-1R
ligands for M2b; IL-10, TGF (transforming growth factor )
and glucocorticoids for M2c (for a recent review, see Boche
et al., 2013). Several reports have shown that intra-tumoral
microglia express an M2 phenotype in response to soluble
factors released by glioma cells. For example, Kaminska and
co-workers have recently characterized the M2 activation
state of rat microglia cells exposed to a conditioned medium
harvested by rat C6 glioma cell cultures as well as the molecu-
lar pathways that direct microglia toward a pro-invasive and
immunosuppressive phenotype (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2011;
Ellert-Miklaszewska et al., 2013). Using co-cultures of the
human microglia cell line CHME-5 and the rat glioma C6
cells, Bouzier-Sore and co-workers showed that microglial
activation after exposure to C6 cells is bi-phasic, with a prior
transitory phagocytic activated phenotype (M2) followed by
a reversal to a non-phagocytic status (M1) (Voisin et al.,
2010). Microglia express a variety of receptors on their sur-
face, which can be activated by signals from glioma cells
(Okada et al., 2009; Held-Feindt et al., 2010). For example
glioma cells produce cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, TGF
and prostaglandins E2 (Rolle et al., 2012). These factors are
able to activate microglial cells; in particular, IL-4 causes al-
ternative activation (M2) of microglia (Gadani et al., 2012).
Moreover, interactions between microglia and tumor cells
are bi-directional (Galv~
ao et al., 2013); under the influence
of glioma, microglia release several classes of molecules that
foster glioma growth, progression and inflammatory acti-
vation (Li and Graeber, 2012). Activated microglia can also
release inflammatory products, such as nitrites, IL-10 and
urea, that may exert detrimental effects on glioma cells.
A further factor of complexity comes from yet other cell
types involved in multi-lateral communications. In fact ma-
lignant gliomas can cause a disruption of the BBB (blood­
brain barrier), thus circulating immune cells not normally
found in the CNS gain access to the tumor areas (Zhan and
Lu, 2012). These include various types of T cells, macrophages
and myeloid-derived suppressor cells that all together partic-
ipate in the response to tumor growth (Charles et al., 2012,
Kushchayev et al., 2012). These cells tend to secrete anti-
inflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokines, peptides and
proteins that can directly activate glioma cells. Additionally,
the glioma is invaded or surrounded by reactive astrocytes,
which contribute to the inflammatory milieu as well (Rivera-
Zengotita and Yachnis, 2012; O'Brien et al., 2013).
In the present paper, we have compared the effects of
different conditioned medium on microglial cell biology.
Conditioned medium harvested from inflammatory activated
glioma cells should better mimic the situation that is expected
to be found in vivo at the moment that a malignant glioma
is diagnosed, i.e. when bi-directional communications be-
tween microglia and tumor cells are already well-established.
For the first time, here we show that microglial cell activa-
tion undergoes a different fate depending on the stimulus
used and, in presence of factors derived from the glioma-
activated cells, they express a distinctive phenotype. The lat-
ter is substantially different from the phenotype expressed
by microglial cells exposed to CM (conditioned media) col-
lected by glioma cells under basal conditions. In particular,
both CM-induced morphological changes in microglial cells,
and increased cell viability and proliferation. However, while
C-CM (control-conditioned media) tend to induce an M2b
polarization of microglia, with production of free oxygen

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Cell culture reagents [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium), DMEM-F12 and FBS] were from Invitrogen Cor-
poration. Antibiotics were from Biochrom AG. Bacterial
endotoxin LPS (Salmonella typhimurium) was from Sigma-
Aldrich. The rat recombinant IFN was purchased from En-
dogen (Pierce Biotechnology). -actin (clone AC-74) mouse
monoclonal antibody was from Sigma Aldrich; rabbit poly-
clonal anti-phospho [Ser2448] mTOR (mammalian target of ra-
pamycin) was purchased from Novus Biological; mouse mon-
oclonal anti-human CD68 was purchased from Dako Italia.
Cell cultures
Microglia
Primary enriched cultures of rat glial cells, microglia and
astrocytes, were prepared as previously described (Dello Russo
et al., 2004). In particular, microglial cells were obtained by
mixed cultures of cortical glial cells (at in vitro day 14), by
gentle shaking. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 3×105 cells/cm2 using 100 l/well DMEM-F12, containing
10% (v/v) FBS and antibiotics. Under these conditions, the
cultures were 95­98% CD11b positive.
C6 glioma cells
C6 glioma cells were passed once a week and were prepared as
previously described (Lisi et al., 2011). CM from the activated
C6 glioma cells was generated following a protocol aimed
to remove the proinflammatory stimulus from the medium.
Briefly, in preliminary experiment microglia cells were incu-
bated in the presence of 1 g/ml LPS and 10 UI/ml IFN for
various times (Figure 1A), then this medium was removed and
replaced with complete culture medium. After a 24-h con-
ditioning period, this medium was collected and used in part
to assess NO release (Figure 1B), and in part was stored at
- 80C until the experiments on microglia were performed.
Based on the results shown in Figure 1, the C6-CM were
prepared as it follows:
A) C-CM: 4 h incubation in the plain medium, followed
by three washes with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and
Figure 1 Effects of LI on C6 NO production

of LI. (B) C6 glioma cells were pre-incubated for different times, as indicated
in presence of LI and at the end of the pre-incubation time, cells were washed

the subsequent 24 h. NO production was assessed indirectly by measurement
of nitrites (the Griess method). Data are expressed as means +
- S.E.M. (n = 6).

addition of fresh plain medium for 24 h. After this second
period of incubation, the CM was collected, centrifuged to
remove cellular debris and stored as C-CM.
B) LI-CM: 4 h incubation with LI, followed by three washes
with PBS and addition of fresh plain medium for 24 h. Af-
ter this second period of incubation, the CM was collected,
centrifuged and stored as LI-CM.
Both CM were stored at - 80C until the experiments on
microglial cells were performed.
DCF (2 ,7 -dichlorofluorescein) assay
Reactive free radicals were measured using H2
DCF-DA [2 ,7-
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Invitrogen)]. At the end
of the experiment, the incubation medium was replaced
by BSS {balanced salt solution [124 mM NaCl, 5.8 mM KCl,

H2
DCF-DA was added to the cells, which were incubated
for additional 45 min at 37C. The fluorescence signal due
to H2
DCF-DA oxidation within the cells was quantified us-
ing a spectrophotometric microplate fluorescence reader
(PerkinElmer Inc.), using 485 nm as excitation and 535 nm
as emission wavelength.
Nitrite assay
iNOS activity was assessed indirectly by measuring nitrite
accumulation in the incubation media. Briefly, an aliquot
of the cell culture media (80 l) was mixed with 40 l
Griess Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and the absorbance mea-
sured at 550 nm in a spectrophotometric microplate reader
(PerkinElmer Inc.). A standard curve was generated during
each assay in the range of concentrations 0­100 M us-
ing NaNO2
(Sigma-Aldrich) as standard. In this range, the
standard detection resulted linear and the minimum de-
tectable concentration of NaNO2
was 3.12 M. In the
absence of stimuli, basal levels of nitrites were below
the detection limit of the assay at all the time points
studied.
mRNA analysis in real-time PCR
Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mi-
cro kit (Qiagen), which included 15 min DNAse treatment.
RNA concentration was measured using the Quant-iTTM
RiboGreen® RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen Corporation). A stan-
dard curve in the range of 0­100 ng was run in each assay
using 16S and 23S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) from Escherichia
coli as standard and provided by the kit. Aliquots (0.15 g) of
RNA were converted to cDNA using random hexamer primers.
Quantitative changes in mRNA levels were estimated by real-
time PCR (Q-PCR) using the following cycling conditions: 35
cycles of denaturation at 95C for 20 s; annealing and ex-
tension at 60C for 20 s; using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast
SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). PCR reactions
were carried out in a 20 l reaction volume in a MX3000P
real-time PCR machine (Stratagene). Primers used for the
evaluation of gene expression are reported in Table 1. Rela-
tive mRNA concentrations were calculated from the take-off
point of reactions (threshold cycle, Ct) using the comparative
quantitation method performed by Stratagene software and
based upon the - Ct method. This analysis approximates
a given sample's target mRNA (e.g., iNOS) level relative to
the mean of the target mRNA levels in untreated controls
(`calibrator' value), thus permitting statistical analysis of de-
viation from the mean even among the controls. Ct values
for -tubulin expression served as a normalizing signal. In
each assay, the PCR efficiency was also calculated using se-
rial dilution of one experimental sample; efficiency values
between 94 and 98% were found for each primer set and
taken into account for the comparative quantitation analysis
(Dello Russo et al., 2009).
Cell viability measurement
Microglial viability was assessed by reduction of the tetra-
zolium compound MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-
carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,
inner salt] contained in the CellTiter AQueous One Solution
Reagent (Promega). For this assay, cells were seeded in
96-well plates. At the end of the experimental procedure,
20 l of MTS reagent were added to the cells that were
further incubated for 2 h. Living cells bio-reduces yellow MTS
into a purple soluble formazan product with an absorbance
peak at 492 nm, that was read in a spectrophotometric
microplate reader (PerkinElmer Inc.)
Cell proliferation assay
Microglial proliferation rate was determined using a non-
radioactive proliferation assay (Exalpha Biological Inc.), used
according to the manufacturer's instructions. This ELISA as-
say measures the incorporation of BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine
or 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) into newly synthesized DNA of
actively proliferating cells. Microglial cells were incubated in
plain medium or C-CM, LI-CM for 48 h. BrdU solution was
added 32 h later directly in the incubation medium, and cells

Glioma and microglial polarization
were kept in the incubator for the remaining 16 h. At the
end of the incubation time, the medium was removed and
cells were fixed. BrdU immunoreactivity was measured us-
ing a specific primary antibody provided by the kit. Data are
expressed as percentage of control values.
Immunocytochemistry
For immunocytochemistry, microglia was plated at a den-
sity of 3.5×105 cells/well on the coated glass coverslips
and treated as indicated for 48 h. At this time, cultures
were washed with PBS containing Ca2 + and Mg2 + (PBS-
w) and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Af-
ter fixation, cultures were washed three times with PBS-w
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 5 min; then
washed and blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS-w for 30 min.
Phalloidin-TRITC (1 M) in PBS-w containing 0.1% BSA and
0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added for 2 h. After incubation,
DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was added for 10 min
and then washed twice with PBS-w. Coverslips were mounted
using Vectashield mounting media. Images were obtained
on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope
equipped with a Cool SNAP professional digital camera and
LUCIA-G/F imaging software.
Western immunoblot
The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,
1% (v/v) igepal, 0.1% (w/v), SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxy-
cholate, 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0] (Sigma-Aldrich) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail diluted 1:250 (Sigma-Aldrich).The
protein content in each sample was determined by
Bradford's method (Biorad) using bovine serum albumin as
standard. A 10-g aliquot of protein was mixed 1:2 with
2X Laemmli Buffer (Biorad), boiled for 5 min, and separated
through SDS/10% PAGE gels. Apparent molecular weights
were estimated by comparison with colored molecular weight
markers (Sigma Aldrich). After electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-
dry electrophoretic transfer (Biorad). The membranes were
blocked with 10% (w/v) low-fat dried skimmed milk pow-
der in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-
20, pH 7.6) (Biorad) for 1 h at room temperature (25C),
and incubated in the presence of the primary antibody
overnight with gentle shaking at 4C. Primary antibodies for
phosphorylated-mTOR, -actin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at
the final concentration of 1:1000. Primary antibodies were
removed, membranes washed three times in TBST, and fur-
ther incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of
specific secondary antibody, anti-rabbit for mTOR and anti-
mouse for -actin IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) con-
jugated (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:15,000. Following three
washes in TBST, bands were visualized by incubation in ECL
reagents (GE Healthcare) and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (GE
Healthcare). The same membranes were washed three times
in TBST, blocked with 10% (w/v) low-fat dried skimmed milk
powder in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and used for
-actin immunoblot.
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
Human tumor tissue obtained from surgical resection
of patients with IV grade glioblastoma were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.6
overnight at 4C. Dehydration of tissue was through a se-
ries of 80%, 95% (v/v) ethanol 1 h each followed by 100%
ethanol overnight. Two 100% (v/v) xylene washes were
done for 1 h each and then 1 h in 60C Paraplast Plus
(Tyco/Healthcare). After a change of Paraplast Plus, tissue
was incubated in a 60C vacuum oven for 2 h prior to plac-
ing in molds to cool and solidify. Sections, 5-m thick, were
cut and mounted. Sections were deparaffinized by drying on
superfrost plus slides (Fisher), heating at 56C overnight, and
then washing through mixed xylenes, 100% ethanol, 95%
ethanol, ddHO. Slides were immersed in 10 mm citrate buffer,
pH 6.0, dry heated for 10 min each to unmask antigen sites,
and then cooled and washed in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was inhibited by rinsing the slides in 3% hydro-
gen peroxide for 5 min. Non-specific binding was blocked by
5 min incubation with the Super Block Solution (ScyTek Lab-
oratories). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated for
30 min at room temperature with monoclonal Mouse Anti-
Human CD68 (1:100; Dako Italia). Sections were washed ex-
tensively with PBS and subsequently treated with the Ultra
Tek Anti-Polyvalent kit (ScyTek Laboratories). Finally, sections
were treated with 3,3 -diaminobenzidine as chromogen, con-
trasted with hematoxylin­eosin and mounted.
Data analysis
All experiments were performed using five to six replicates
per each experimental group, and repeated at least three
times. For the RNA analysis, the samples were assayed in
triplicates, and the experiments were repeated at least twice.
Data were analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA followed by
the Bonferroni's post hoc test or by unpaired t test where
appropriate. P values<0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
As shown in Figure 1, C6 cells can be activated in response
to a standard pro-inflammatory stimulus, namely LI (LPS at
1 g/ml plus IFN at 10 units/ml). In particular, we evaluated
the activity of the iNOS , which was significantly increased
after an incubation period of 24 h (Figure 1A). The effects of
LI were long-lasting; in fact, pre-exposure of C6 cells to the
pro-inflammatory stimulus increased the levels of nitrites in
the following 24 h incubation in the plain medium, regardless

to 50% microglia incubation medium [DMEM-F12 with 10%
(v/v) FBS] was used; whereas a medium consisting of 50% C6
cell incubation medium (i.e. DMEM with 1% FBS) and 50%
DMEM-F12 (10% FBS) was prepared for controls.
First, we tested the effects of C-CM and LI-CM on mi-
croglial morphology, cell viability and proliferation. Mi-
croglial cultures exposed for 24 h to 50% C-CM or 50%
LI-CM did undergo morphological transformation into amoe-
boid cells, as shown by phase contrast microscopy (Fig-
ure 2) and F-actin staining with phalloidin-TRIC (Figure 2).
The switching of incubation medium from 100% DMEM-
F12 (10% FBS) to 50% DMEM-F12 (10% FBS)/ 50% DMEM
(1% FBS) for 24 h had no effect on microglia morphology

(Figures 2B­2F); thus supporting the use of this medium as
control treatment in subsequent experiments. As expected, a
48-h exposure of microglial cells to CM harvested from both
resting and LI-activated C6 cells increased microglial viability
(Figure 3A) and cell proliferation (Figure 3B). No significant
differences were observed between the two CM on these two
parameters.
We have recently shown that the mTOR kinase is impor-
tant to maintain microglial viability and cell proliferation;
moreover, it is involved in cytokine-dependent microglial
pro-inflammatory activation (Dello Russo et al., 2009). In
light of this evidence, the effect of CM on the activation
status of mTOR was assessed. As shown in Figure 4, we found
a significant difference among the two CM in the magnitude
of phosphorilation of mTOR kinase at Ser2448, which is an
index of mTOR activation: in 2-h experiments, we detected
a 4-fold and a 6-fold increase in mTOR activation after the
exposure of microglia to C-CM and LI-CM, respectively, com-
pared with the control medium. Thus, although responses
induced by exposure to CMs are qualitatively similar, LI-CM
elicited a net + 50% increase in mTOR activation compared
with C-CM. A not-conditioned medium containing 1 ng/ml

LPS, used as a positive control, induced a 1.5-fold increase in
the activation of mTOR, whereas the exposure to a medium
containing 50% DMEM (1% FBS) reduced mTOR activation
by roughly 50% (results not shown).
A subsequent set of experiments was carried out to as-
sess the effect of glioma CM on microglial pro-inflammatory
activity. First, we measured total levels of reactive species,
both nitrogen and oxygen-free radicals, using the fluores-
cent probe H2
DCF-DA (LeBel et al., 1992). Both CMs were
able to increase total ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels
(Figure 5A). However, the exposure of microglial cells to C-
CM significantly increased the expression of iNOS (Figure 5C)
with no sizable effect on iNOS activity (Figure 5B), whereas
on the contrary LI-CM was found able to increase both iNOS
expression and enzyme activity (Figures 5B and 5C). Further-
more, LI-CM significantly increased the expression of dif-
ferent genes involved in both classic (M1) and alternative
(M2) activation of microglial cells. In response to LI-CM, we
detected a significant up-regulation of the following genes:
CD86, an M1/M2 polarization marker (Figure 6A); TNF- (Fig-
ure 6B) and IL-1 (Figure 6C), markers of M1 classic activa-
tion; TGF (Figure 6D), an M2 marker; ARG (Figure 6E), an
M2a polarization marker; and IL-10 (Figure 6F) a marker of
the M2b activation status. Conversely, C-CM mostly induced
a significant up-regulation of genes involved in the induc-
tion of the alternative M2b activation phenotype, such as
IL-10 (Figure 6F) and TGF (Figure 6D). Finally, C-CM had no
stimulatory effect on ARG expression, whereas a 20% reduc-
tion was observed after 24 h (Figure 6E).Taken together, these
data show that soluble factors from glioma cells promote mi-
croglial inflammatory activation, even though C-CM seems

to specifically induce M2b-type activation, while LI-CM pro-
mote a mixed phenotype, with M1 and M2a/2b polarized
cells.
Complex glioma-microglia interactions are also confirmed
by the finding that pre-exposure of microglial cells to C6 CMs
induces different responses to a classic M1 pro-inflammatory
stimulus, as LPS. As shown in Figure 7, a 24-h challenge
with LPS did not modify iNOS expression (A) and activity (B)
in microglia pre-treated for 24 h with C-CM. Conversely, a
24-h pretreatment with LI-CM was associated to a 3-fold
increase in iNOS expression, and a 2-fold increase in the
amount of nitrites, induced by LPS with respect to controls
(Figure 7). In a further series of experiments, we investigated
the effects of C6-CMs pretreatment on COX (cyclooxygenase)
isoforms gene expression. Pretreatment of microglial cells
with C-CM results in a selective up-regulation of constitutive
COX (COX1), but not COX-2, in response to LPS (Figure7C),
whereas on the contrary pre-incubation with LI-CM led to
the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory COX2, but not COX1
(Figure 7D).
Finally, sections of glioma tissue obtained from surgical
resection of patients diagnosed with IV grade glioblastoma
(GBM) were stained for CD68 (PG-M1 clone), a marker of
phagocytic activity of macrophages/microglia (Boche et al.,
2013). As shown in Figure 8, a diffuse infiltrate of CD68-
positive cells was detected, thus supporting the hypothesis
that in vitro findings presented here might indeed occur in
the setting of human pathology.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that media collected from
both basal and pre-activated C6 glioma cells induce morpho-
logical changes in microglia cells and increase cell viability
and proliferation. However, while C-CM induced a specific
M2b-type polarization of microglia, characterized mainly by
a significant up-regulation of IL-10 and TGF gene expres-
sion; LI-CM harvested from pre-stimulated (LPS­IFN) glioma
cells led to a mixed phenotype, M1 and M2a/M2b, as indi-
cated by the concurrent up-regulation of iNOS, TNF, IL-1,
TGF, ARG, IL-10 and the M1/M2 polarization marker, CD86.
Incubation medium used for C6 cell cultures (DMEM with 1%
FBS) differs from that used for microglia (DMEM-F12 with
10% FBS); being the most important difference between
them the percentage of serum added to the medium, which
can directly affect cell viability as well as the response to
pro-inflammatory stimuli. Therefore one might expect that
the switch of the microglial cultures to a medium contain-
ing 50% of C6 cell incubation medium could per se induce
morphological changes. However, this is not the case since
no significant differences were associated to the different
type of medium (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E and 2F). Therefore the
50% C6 cell incubation medium was used as control in most
of the experimental procedures.
The CM from activated C6 glioma cells were generated
following a more complex protocol (see the Method sec-
tion), aimed to remove LPS and IFN from the media in order
to avoid their direct effects on microglia. By using LI-CM we

intended to mimic the in vivo condition of late-stage pathol-
ogy, when gliomas cause significant breakdown of the BBB
(Wolburg et al., 2012); as a consequence, circulating immune
cells not normally found in the CNS invade the tumor and re-
lease factors promoting the pro-inflammatory activation of
glioma cells (Zhan and Lu., 2012). Conversely, we considered
the C-CM experimental paradigm as an in vitro correlate of
early-stage glioma pathology, when glioma cells are seem-
ingly not yet activated.
Both C-CM and LI-CM increased microglia cell prolifer-
ation in a similar manner, suggesting the similar underly-
ing mechanisms, seemingly not involving pro-inflammatory
molecular pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, Kamin-
ska and co-workers reported that glioma-derived solu-
ble factors induce the activation of focal adhesion ki-
nase, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B),
ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), and P38 MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways, re-
sulting in enhancement of cell motility, phagocytosis, sus-
tained proliferation and a distinct genomic response. Such
activated microglial phenotype appeared to be unique, be-
ing not associated with activation of NFB (nuclear factor
B) and Stat1 and thus up-regulation of inflammatory genes
(Ellert-Miklaszewska et al., 2013).
We have recently demonstrated that mTOR kinase activa-
tion is involved in microglial cell proliferation and viability
under basal conditions, as well as in pro-inflammatory ac-
tivation in response to bacterial endotoxin or a mixture of
inflammatory cytokines (Dello Russo et al., 2009). Phospho-
rylation at Ser2448 of the mTOR protein primarily reflects
a feedback signal from the mTOR downstream target, the
p70S6K (p70S6 kinase), and it is therefore considered a re-
liable marker of mTOR activation within the cells (Rosner
et al., 2010). Interestingly, both C-CM and LI-CM increased

Human tumor sections from four different patients were stained with mon-
oclonal mouse anti-human CD68 [PG-M1 clone] to observe the presence of

mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448, albeit to a different extent.
In this regard, we have previously observed that the effect
of LPS was more marked compared with cytokines on mTOR
phosphorylation at Ser2448, suggesting that different stimuli
can induce a different level of mTOR phosphorylation, possi-
bly because of different signaling mechanisms. Moreover, we
can speculate that different magnitudes of mTOR phospho-
rylation can be associated to different pattern of microglial
activation. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the
higher level of mTOR activation induced by LI-CM in compar-
ison with C-CM (or else to the direct effect of 1 ng/ml LPS)
resulted in the activation of a larger array of inflammatory
mediators. In particular, the exposure of microglial cells to
C-CM, despite a modest albeit significant increase in iNOS ex-
pression (Figure 5C), did not modify iNOS activity (Figure 5B),
whereas it significantly increased IL-10 and TGF gene ex-
pression after 24 h (Figures 6F and 6D). Conversely, LI-CM was
found to increase both iNOS expression and the enzyme ac-
tivity (Figures 5B and 5C), and was also able to increase other
markers of M1 inflammatory activation, such as TNF and
IL-1 (Figures 6B and 6C). However, LI-CM also significantly
increased the expression of ARG, IL-10 and TGF (Figures 6D­
6F) as well as the expression of the M1/M2 marker CD86
(Figure 6A). In this regard, Chhor et al. (2013) have previously
shown that iNOS is a marker of M1 activation, ARG of M2a
activation and IL-10 of M2b activation. Therefore, our results,
based on this classification, suggest that C-CM is able to po-
larize the microglia cells mainly versus the M2b alternative
status of activation, whereas LI-CM induces a switch toward
M1 and M2a phenotypes. Interestingly, Chhor et al. (2013)
also showed that a pre-exposure of microglial cells to the
M2a-inducing stimulus IL-4 before the LPS challenge failed
to prevent the typical induction of M1 markers (COX2, iNOS).
Similarly, in our model the administration of LPS after LI-CM
(i.e. an M2a-inducing condition) significantly increased COX2
gene expression and both iNOS gene expression and activity.
On the other hand, a previous exposure to C-CM, taken as
an M2b-inducing condition, prevented the typical effects of
LPS, i.e. microglial expression of M1 markers. Similar find-
ings were also obtained by Hu et al.(2012) in focal cerebral
ischemia. Consistent with our data, Voisin et al. (2010) found
that 45% of the microglia appeared to be in a low phago-
cytic state (M1) and 55% of the cells had a high capacity
for phagocytosis (M2) at the beginning of exposure to both
isolated culture conditions and microglia-glioma co-cultures
(human microglial cell line, CHME5 and rat glioma C6 cells).
During the first 3 h of co-culture, the population in a low
phagocytic state tended to decrease, whereas the opposite
occurred with the population in a higher phagocytic state;
however, after 6 h of co-culture, this trend tended to reverse
so that, after 24 h of co-culture, a large increase in the M1
population and a drastic reduction of the M2 phagocytic one
were observed.
At a late stage of this research we thought it was interest-
ing to seek for any parameter of human pathology that could
possibly correlate with our in vitro findings on the animal
model. Interestingly, in human glioma tissue obtained from
surgical resection of patients with IV grade glioblastoma, we
detected a significant amount of CD68 positive cells. The
latter is a marker of macrophage/microglial phagocytic ac-
tivity, thus a not specific index of M1/M2 activated cells.
The presence of CD68 positive cells in all the analyzed tumor
samples, albeit in different amount, suggest the relevance of
activated microglia/macrophages in the human pathology as
well. However, further characterization is necessary in order
to correlate the in vitro data to the human pathology with
respect to the extent of microglial polarization at different
stages of disease and/or the possible neoplastic nature of
CD68 positive cells, as hypothesized by the group of Seyfried
(Huysentruyt et al., 2011).
In conclusion, our data consistently show that a different
degree of glioma activation can polarize microglia cells in
different manners, suggesting that microglia might in turn
exert different effects on glioma cells depending on the stage
of disease. Additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the

role of microglia within the glioma and see whether differ-
ent populations differentiate over time, possibly correlating
with a different outcome of the disease. It is also possible
that pharmacological strategies aimed at blocking microglial
differentiation and their polarization towards the M2 pheno-
type might have beneficial effects in the course of the cancer
pathology.
