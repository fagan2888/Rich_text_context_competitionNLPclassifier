The purpose of this study was to develop practical
prediction equations for estimating adult mid-arm
circumference (AC) using self-reported height and
weight data from NHANES III 1988­1994 and NHANES
1999­2000. Both surveys used a complex sample design
to obtain nationally representative data for the US
civilian noninstitutionalized population. The analytic
sample consisted of 4801 men and 4854 women in
NHANES III and 1960 men and 2180 women from
NHANES 1999­2000. Self-reported weight, height, and
age data from NHANES III were used for model building,
and similar data from NHANES 1999­2000 were used for
validation. An all-possible regressions procedure by
gender was used to derive the mid-AC prediction
equations. The final prediction equations for adult mid-
AC are (for self-reported weight in pounds and height
in inches) for men: AC (cm) ¼ 32.52145 þ 0.10975 Â (wt)
À0.26057 Â (ht)À0.03028 Â (age), R 2 ¼ 0.76; and for wo-
men: AC (cm) ¼ 30.22126 þ 0.13534 Â (wt)À0.34121 Â (ht)
þ 0.09014 Â (age)À0.00082565 Â (age2), R 2 ¼ 0.81. Based
on these equations, tables were created to predict mid-
AC using self-reported height and weight. Clinicians can
refer to our prediction equations and reference tables to
determine mid-AC and proper BP cuff sizes.

Introduction
High blood pressure (BP), or hypertension, defined
as average systolic BP equal to or greater than
140 mmHg or diastolic BP equal to or greater than
90 mmHg, is a major public health problem in the
United States. In 1999­2000, approximately 28.7%
of the US population, or 58.4 million Americans,
had hypertension.1 Several factors affect BP mea-
surement variability and accuracy.2,3 An inappropri-
ate choice of cuff size for the upper arm frequently
leads to inaccurate BP values.4­8 A cuff bladder
width that is too narrow for the mid-arm circumfer-
ence (AC) will overestimate BP, resulting in `cuff
hypertension,' whereas a bladder width that is
too wide for the AC will result in falsely low BP
readings.9,10
The Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, and Treatment of High BP recommends
that an appropriate cuff size be used to ensure
accurate BP readings.11 Recent guidelines for BP
determination strongly recommend that several BP
cuff sizes be available for proper fit of the subject,
and routine measurement of mid-AC is recom-
mended for the initial patient visit.12
While the measurement of mid-AC is not techni-
cally difficult, it is not performed in clinical practice
routinely, even though it is considered crucial for
accurate BP assessment. Further, clinicians do not
routinely check the fit of the `index line' provided
on many BP cuffs to see whether the BP cuff size is
appropriate for the patient. Data on clinical practice

patterns indicate widespread problems in BP cuff
selection. The most common practice appears to be
the use a standard adult-size BP cuff for all subjects,
disregarding mid-AC.13 In one survey of 114 physi-
cians,14 only 3% used an appropriate cuff size to
obtain BP. In another survey of general practi-
tioners,15 only 57% had an appropriately large cuff
available to obtain BP in obese patients. Surveys of
nursing practice reported similar problems.16,17
The ratio of the cuff bladder width (CW) to mid-
arm circumference (CW/AC) is a key parameter for
selecting an appropriate BP cuff size. A CW/AC ratio
of 0.40 is recommended to give the optimum fit for
accurate BP measurement.3,4,12,18 This recommenda-
tion, however, is subject to continuing discussion in
the scientific literature.18,19
The need to tailor BP cuff size to the individual is
more pressing today due to increasing overweight
and obesity among US adults.20 Mid-AC is positively
correlated with body weight; recent US anthro-
pometric data demonstrate a parallel increase in
the population mean mid-AC.21­23 Using a BP cuff
inappropriate for mid-AC in obese patients results
in more biased BP readings than in the nonobese
patient.24 This is especially true when using a
regular adult cuff (12 cm) on an obese individual
with large arms.
The combination of measured height, weight,
gender and age predicts 80% of the variability in
mid-AC in men and 86% of the variability in
women.23 Although it is preferable to base BP cuff
selection on measured data, there are some circum-
stances when it may be useful to determine BP cuff
size based on self-reported data. Also, it is of
scientific interest to examine the relationship
between mid-AC prediction equations based on
measured, as opposed to self-reported height and
weight data. Currently, there are no prediction
equations for adult mid-AC based on self-reported
height and weight. This paper provides such predic-
tion equations, and reference tables for estimated
mid-AC and BP cuff sizes using self-reported data.
Also, we present an evaluation of the agreement
between our prediction equations for mid-AC based
on measured vs self-reported height and weight.
Study design
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional, nationally
representative survey with a complex, stratified,
multistage probability cluster design. The survey
consists of a detailed household interview and a
health examination conducted in a mobile examina-
tion center (MEC). Procedures for sample selection,
interviews and examinations were similar to for
both NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES 1999­
2002.25 Informed consent was obtained from all
participants and the protocol was approved by the
NCHS Ethics Review Board.
Measurements
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 used the
same interview questions to collect data on self-
reported height (in inches) and weight (in pounds).
Both surveys also employed an identical examina-
tion protocol for measurement of standing height,
weight, mid-AC, and for obtaining BP. The NHANES
procedure manuals describe the questionnaire and
examination protocols, and are available on the
NHANES web site.26
Sample and data analysis
Each NHANES survey provides national estimates
for the US population. Samples were drawn in-
dependently with no intended overlap. NHANES III
data were used as a model building data set to
develop the mid-AC prediction equations, and
NHANES 1999­2000 data were employed as the
validation data set.27,28 The current analytic sample
uses survey data for all participants ages 20 years
and over (including the elderly ages 80 þ ), who
were both interviewed and examined and for whom
measured mid-AC and self-reported height and
weight were available. This included 4854 women
and 4801 men in NHANES III and 2180 women and
1960 men from NHANES 1999­2000 (see Table 1).
The analysis was stratified by gender. The model
predictors were selected on the basis of their high

correlation with mid-AC measurement and concep-
tual relevance to the model building.21­24 As neither
education nor race/ethnicity contributed to the
accuracy of self-reported height and weight in
NHANES II and NHANES III, these terms were not
included in the self-reported model.29,30 Also, in
final modeling, interaction terms did not contribute
to accuracy of prediction. Therefore, the final
predictor variables selected included weight, height,
age, and a quadratic term for age. For a detailed
discussion of model selection criteria see Ostchega
et al.23
Briefly, an all-possible regressions procedure was
used to arrive at parsimonious models to predict
mid-AC. The models with the largest adjusted R2,
the lowest Mallow's C(P) statistic, and all estimated
regression coefficients significant (Po0.05) in both
model were selected.31­33 Four additional analytic
procedures were performed to establish the predic-
tive regression model validity. First, we estimated
the predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS)
statistics for all regression models and selected the
model with the smallest PRESS value.34 Moreover,
PRESS statistics can be used to detect outlying or
influential observations. Specifically, if the PRESS
statistic values are considerably larger than the
residual sum of squares, it may indicate the
existence of outliers in the data.34 Second, the mean
squared predicting error (MSPR) was calculated for
the validation model. An MSPR which does not
differ greatly from the model building data set mean
square error (MSE) indicates that the regression
equation derived from the model fitting data set is a
reasonable and valid indicator of the predictive
ability of the fitted regression model.34 Third, cross-
validation was performed using the model-building
coefficient values to calculate predicted AC values
and validating them by correlation analysis with the
observed AC values in the validation data sets. The
final step in the validation process involved asses-
sing the impact of the CW/AC ratio on systolic and
diastolic BP variability for men and women sepa-
rately using NHANES 1999­2000 data. CW/AC ratio
as an independent variable was initially regressed
with measured mid-AC in the denominator and a
second time with predicted AC in the denominator
for self-reported weight and height, using systolic
BP or diastolic BP as the dependent variable. In the
numerator (CW) were BP cuff sizes (12, 15, and
18 cm) that were selected by the BP observers in the
MEC using a table as a guide for appropriate cuff
selection based on the 0.40 CW/ACA ratio criter-
ion.35 During NHANES, the examiners used the
appropriate BP cuff size 90% of the time.35 We
compared the R2 values resulting from measured AC
with the results of AC derived from the predicting
equations. We expected that both the measured and
predicted CW/AC ratios would contribute a similar
amount of variation to the average systolic and
diastolic BP, and therefore were likely to contribute
a similar degree of bias to the above measurements.
All data were analyzed as a simple random sample
because no national estimates are reported. The data
were analyzed using SAS (Version 8.02, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Tables were constructed using the prediction
equation to provide mean mid-AC by gender, age,
weight, and height categories. As age had a curvi-
linear relationship with AC and an initial positive
correlation followed by a negative correlation (not
shown), age was dichotomized into two age groups.
For men, the correlation between age and mid-AC
was positive for ages 20­50 (r ¼ 0.14) and negative
for ages greater than 50 (r ¼ À0.37); for women, the
correlation was positive for ages 20­60 (r ¼ 0.21) and
negative for ages greater than 60 (r ¼ À0.33). Since
the initial set of prediction equations were con-
firmed in the split sample validation step, the
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 data for
weight and height were subsequently pooled to
produce the final set of prediction equations. This
improved the precision of the estimates for the mean
mid-AC values.23
All mid-AC estimates derived from measured vs
self-reported height and weight equations were
categorized using the American Heart Association
BP cuff size recommendations.12,36 The mid-AC
range for the adult BP cuff size was 27­34 cm; for
the large adult size, 35­44 cm; and for the adult
thigh size, 45­52 cm. Percent agreement was com-
puted for these categorized variables by gender and
age groups: men ages 20­50 and 450 years; and
women ages 20­60 and 460 years.
Results
Table 1 shows sample sizes and means for the age
and anthropomorphic characteristics of NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2000 participants. Results are
presented by gender. Table 2 shows the final models
developed to predict actual mid-AC using self-
reported weight and height data. Each predictor
contributed significantly (Po0.01) to predicting
mid-AC, and combined, they explained 76% of
variation in men and 81% of the variation in
women. Body weight is the most important pre-
dictor of AC; a one pound increase in weight
resulted in an increase of 0.11 cm in AC in men
and 0.14 cm in women. MSE and adjusted R2 values
were very similar for the building and validation
models (men: MSE ¼ 3.7 vs 4.1; adjusted R2 ¼ 0.76
and 0.76; women: MSE ¼ 5.0 vs 5.4; adjusted
R2 ¼ 0.81 and 0.81). The PRESS statistics are similar
to the SSE in all models, suggesting no outliers
or influential observations. Further support for
the validity of the fitted regression model is the
observation that MSPRs in the validation models
do not differ greatly from the MSEs in the model
building regression sets for men or women (men:
MSPR ¼ 4.1, MSE ¼ 3.7; women: MSPR ¼ 5.4,
MSE ¼ 5.0).

Figures 1 and 2 are scatter plots of the predicted
mid-AC values vs the measured mid-AC values for
men and women, respectively. The bivariate correla-
tions were highly significant and positively corre-
lated for both genders, suggesting a high degree of
association between predicted and measured mid-
AC generally (men: r ¼ 0.87312, Po0.0001; women:
r ¼ 0.89742, Po0.0001).
The effect of the CW/AC ratio on systolic and
diastolic BP variability was examined using pre-
dicted and measured AC in the denominator. The
CW/AC ratio based on measured or estimated mid-
AC did not have a significant effect on systolic BP
overall. This was true both for estimated mid-AC
calculated with the prediction equations and for
measured mid-AC. In contrast, the composite CW/
AC ratio had an effect on diastolic BP when either
predicted or measured mid-AC values were used.
The relative magnitude of the differences in the R2
values obtained with measured vs predicted mid-AC
were, however, extremely small, and the largest
difference in R2 values amounted to less than 0.5%.

As this systematic error was minimal, it did not
appear to affect the overall validity of the prediction
equations.
The prediction equations were evaluated using a
combined NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000
data set. Table 3 and Figure 3a and b provide
predicted mean mid-AC by weight, height, age, and
gender based on the derived equations using self-
reported height (lbs) and weight (in). The equation
developed for men is: mid-AC (cm) ¼ 32.52145 þ
0.10975 Â (wt)À0.26057 Â (ht)À0.03028 Â (age). The
equation developed for women is: mid-AC (cm) ¼
30.22126þ 0.13534Â (wt)À0.34121Â (ht)þ 0.09014Â
(age)À0.00082565 Â (age2). The combined data pro-
vided the same results as the split-model data.
Specifically, each of the individual predictors con-
tributed significantly (Po0.01) to predicting mid-
AC, and in combination, they explained 76% of
variation in men and 81% of the variation in
women. Mean values for cells with fewer than 28
observations were not provided. All pairwise com-
parisons were significant at ao0.0001, rejecting the
null hypothesis of equality of means.
Percent agreement statistics were calculated for
recommended BP cuff sizes (standard adult, large
adult, and adult thigh) derived from the prediction
equations using measured height and weight data
vs self-reported height and weight data, respectively.
For men, the overall agreement between the two
prediction methods was 94% for the age group 20­
50 years, and 95% for ages 450 years. Among men,
the standard adult cuff category had the highest
agreement (96­97% by age group) and the adult
thigh cuff had the lowest agreement (83­84% by age
group). For women, overall agreement was 92% for
ages 20­60 years and 94% for ages 460 years.
Among women, the standard adult cuff category had
the highest agreement (95­96% by age group) and
adult thigh cuff had the lowest agreement (76­78%
by age group).

Discussion
In the clinical setting, it is clearly preferable to
determine BP cuff size based on direct mid-AC
measurement, a secondary choice is to use tables
derived from predicted mid-AC based on measured
height and weight data.23 The method presented for
using self-reported height and weight data provides
a third alternative for BP cuff selection. Although
the use of self-reported height and weight data is
less accurate than those based on measurements; its
general validity is supported by the high level of
agreement between methods for predicting mid-AC
and appropriate BP cuff size based on measured vs
self-reported data.
There are several settings in which self-reported
height and weight data may be useful to select an
appropriate BP cuff. In mobile or home health care
settings, for example visiting nursing, it may not
always be practical to carry portable scales and
stadiometers to obtain measured height and weight
or to obtain mid-AC. Also, in health screening
settings (e.g. health fairs) where personnel costs
and time constraints must be considered, self-
reported height and weight data may expedite BP
cuff selection. Individual self-measurement of BP is
a growing trend. In situations where subjects test
their own BP with automated equipment, self-
reported data may be used to help select appropriate
BP cuff sizes. Consumers may ask providers to
help them select an appropriate BP cuff for home
monitoring and to facilitate such discussions,
preliminary informational materials could be
developed using the tables we developed.
Body weight is the main predictor of, and is
positively correlated with variation in mid-AC. Our
current findings support previous work that relates
increasing mid-AC to increased weight.21­23 The
relationship between self-reported and measured
height and weight was previously reported. Kucz-
marski et al.30 using NHANES III data concluded
that self-reported weight and height can be used
with younger and middle aged adults, but they had
some reservations about using self-reported weight
and height in adults ages 60 and older. The
association between self-reported and measured
height and weight was also demonstrated with
NHANES II data; however, no conclusions were
drawn there regarding self-reporting reliability by
age.29 Therefore, for adults age 60 and older, it is
strongly recommended to base BP cuff size selection
on either direct mid-AC measurement or tables
values based on measured height and weight data.23
The NHANES prediction equations for mid-AC
are derived from a nationally representative sample
using standardized research protocol. Technically,
the results of our study apply strictly to the US
general population as a whole, which is quite large.
While it has sometimes been assumed for Public
Health planning purposes that results from the US
NHANES surveys apply generally to the situation
internationally, this should not be simply be
assumed to be the case. Ideally, similar studies
would be carried out in other countries and
international results compared to allow us to assess
whether the US results accurately reflect the general
situation. All prediction models have some amount
of unexplained variance (1ÀR2). Specifically, for
men in our model, 24% of the variance in mid-AC
values estimated from self-reported data was un-
explained. However, when predicted AC was used
in the denominator of the CW/AC ratio and this was
regressed on mean SBP and DBP, there were minor
differences compared to regression models using
directly measured mid-AC in the denominator of
the CW/AC ratio term.
The overall background for, and major conclu-
sions of our study, are summarized in Table 4. BP
monitoring is an essential component of hyperten-
sion diagnosis and treatment, and proper cuff size is
required to measure BP accurately. Graphics based
on prediction equations for mid-AC provide clin-
icians with a convenient reference to select an
appropriate BP cuff (Figure 3a and b). Body weight

is the major contributor to mid-AC variability and
with the increasing trend towards obesity in the US
and internationally accurate BP cuff fit is essential
for valid BP readings. The current practice of using
one cuff size (usually the standard adult cuff) to
obtain all BP measurements coupled with the
general population trend towards increasing body
size otherwise seems likely to lead to increasingly
inaccurate BP readings. The suggested mid-AC
prediction equations therefore have clinical rele-
vance in helping select appropriate sized BP cuffs.

Table 4 Summary of the findings
What is known:
1. The proper selection of blood pressure (BP) cuff sizes for accurate BP readings depends on accurate mid-arm circumference (AC)
measurements.
2. Because of recent population trends towards increasing obesity and mid-AC, practical methods for the selection of correctly sized BP
cuffs is increasingly important.
3. Valid prediction equations for mid-AC exist based on measured height and weight.
4. Measured height and weight are highly correlated with self-reported height and weight.
It was unknown:
1. Whether the proper selection of blood pressure (BP) cuff sizes for accurate BP readings can be based on self-reported height and
weight, as opposed to direct measurement data.
Evidence from the current study:
1. Prediction equations for mid-AC were derived from self-reported height and weight data using a large nationally representative
sample.
2. The prediction equations performed well in both men and women, sufficient to have utility in mid-AC estimation and BP cuff size
determination.
3. Compared to direct mid-AC measurement, or mid-AC estimation based on measured height and weight, the prediction equations based
on self-reported data are less accurate, and are a third choice for clinicians. They are likely to be of practical utility only in special
settings.
