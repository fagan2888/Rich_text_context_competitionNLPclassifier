Article
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a debilitating mood disor-
der, and is characterized by a perinatal onset any time
between the third trimester of pregnancy to 4 weeks post-
partum (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). PPD
symptoms mirror major depression and include pervasive
low mood, sleep disturbances, weight changes, poor cop-
ing, impaired concentration, anxiety, feelings of worthless-
ness or guilt, and reduced confidence and self-esteem
(O'Hara & McCabe, 2013; O'Hara & Swain, 1996). PPD
symptoms may reduce the mother's parenting capacity,
and her PPD symptoms may persist into a major depres-
sive disorder (Post and Antenatal Depression Association,
2013). Consequently, the infant can suffer lifelong effects
leading to an insecure attachment, impaired socioemo-
tional functioning, attention deficits, and behavioral dis-
turbances (Chabrol & Callahan, 2007). Many women fail
to seek a treatment for PPD, however, believing their
symptoms are those typical of the baby blues (Post and
Antenatal Depression Association, 2013). The baby blues
are characterized by transient symptoms that usually pass
within 2 weeks post birth, whereas PPD symptoms are
more pervasive and have a greater impact on the mother
and child. While the literature is rich for certain types of
risk factors, other areas remain underresearched. For
example, perfectionism and locus of control (LOC) are
two factors that, despite associations with PPD, have been
largely neglected.
Perfectionism remains a contentious concept, although
growing consensus suggests it is characterized by the setting
of high standards coupled with extreme self-critical evalua-
tions (Hamachek, 1978; Hewitt & Flett, 1991a). At low lev-
els, perfectionism is considered adaptive and linked to
positive affect (Frost, Heimberg, Holt, Mattia, & Neubauer,
1993), while at high levels, it is considered maladaptive and
a risk factor for depression (Dimitrovsky, Levy-Shiff, &
Schattner-Zanany, 2002). A common conceptualization
divides perfectionism into three dimensions. Self-oriented
perfectionism is characterized by the standards one holds for
the self; socially prescribed perfectionism is defined by the
standards one thinks society holds for them; and other-ori-
ented perfectionism is characterized by the standards one
holds for others (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a, 1991b). This
approach is taken in the present study.
Positive associations have been identified between self-
oriented perfectionism and depression (Hewitt & Flett,
1991a), and between socially prescribed perfectionism and
depression (Shafran & Mansell, 2001). Hewitt and Flett

Perfect Imperfections: Locus of
Control, Perfectionism, and Postpartum
Depression
Lauren C. Jackman1, Einar B. Thorsteinsson1,
and Dominic G. McNeil1
Abstract
We examined whether locus of control (LOC) moderates the apparent relationship between perfectionism and postpartum
depression (PPD). It was predicted that external LOC would moderate the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism
and PPD, and socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD. A sample of 243 women completed an online self-report questionnaire
assessing perfectionism, LOC, and PPD. Self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were significantly associated
with PPD. Increased personal loci of control (i.e., low external LOC and high internal LOC) moderated (strengthened)
the relationship between perfectionism and PPD. LOC may be an important concept and one of the underlying factors at
work in the perfectionism­PPD relationship. This outcome may be attributed to the self-directed nature of self-oriented
perfectionists.

(1991a) claimed that both dimensions are pivotal to predict-
ing depression. It is argued that self-oriented perfectionists
generate their own failures as they tend to set unrealistically
high standards and stringently critique their performance,
which leads to increased failure. Ashby, Rice, and Martin
(2006) supported this claim by identifying moderate to
strong effect sizes (r = .38-.68) for maladaptive perfection-
ism (defined as self-oriented perfectionism) and major
depression. The researchers concluded that self-worth and
self-criticism play a central role for perfectionists with
depression. While this research has focused on the link
between perfectionism and depression, there is suggestion of
a similar relationship between perfectionism and PPD (e.g.,
Gelabert et al., 2012; Mazzeo et al., 2006; Oddo-Sommerfeld,
Hain, Louwen, & Schermelleh-Engel, 2016). For example,
Mazzeo et al. (2006) identified a link between socially pre-
scribed perfectionism and PPD (r = .34) among 1,119 female
twins. The perfectionism­PPD relationship also has to be
understood in relation to perceptions of LOC as it may have
important implications for identifying women at risk of PPD.
LOC is characterized as an individual's perceived ability
to exercise control over the outcome of life events (Rotter,
1966). The theory purports that people with an internal LOC
("internals") believe they are in control of the outcomes in
their life, whereas people with an external LOC ("externals")
believe their life outcomes are left up to chance/fate (Rotter,
1966). External LOC was later expanded to include an addi-
tional dimension of "powerful others," whereby control is
placed with other people such as parents, teachers, or doctors
(Levenson, 1973). Internals do not have greater control over
their life, just the perception that they do, consequently, they
are more emotionally adjusted, whereas externals feel pow-
erless to achieve their outcomes. Dimitrovsky, Perez-
Hirshberg, and Itskowitz (1987) concluded that externals
may be more sensitive to external influences and have
extreme responses to critical life events such as childbirth.
Perfectionism theory purports that high level self-oriented
perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism are mal-
adaptive (Hamachek, 1978) due to self-oriented perfection-
ists generating their own failures and socially prescribed
perfectionists experiencing cognitive dissonance (Hewitt &
Flett, 1991a). LOC theory characterizes externals as mal-
adaptive, as externals feel powerless (Rotter, 1966). Thus,
the concept of uncontrollability exists both in the literature
for LOC (external) and perfectionism (socially prescribed
perfectionism). Despite this theoretical connection between
maladaptive perfectionism and LOC, few studies have inves-
tigated this relationship alongside PPD.
Empirical evidence shows that socially prescribed perfec-
tionism, self-oriented perfectionism, and external LOC are
all independently linked with PPD (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a).
Hewitt and Flett (1991b) found external LOC to be posi-
tively associated with socially prescribed perfectionism, r =
.20. They asserted that self-oriented perfectionists with inter-
nal LOC can be proactive in changing their standards,
whereas socially prescribed perfectionists with external LOC
are more reactive (Hewitt & Flett, 1991b). Recent studies
have found similar results between maladaptive perfection-
ism and high levels of external LOC (Periasamy & Ashby,
2002; Stewart & De George-Walker, 2013).
The present study investigates (a) the associations
between perfectionism, LOC, and PPD; and (b) whether
LOC moderates the relationship between perfectionism and
PPD. It is hypothesized that both self-oriented and socially
prescribed perfectionism will be positively correlated with
PPD and external LOC will be positively correlated with
PPD. It is also hypothesized that LOC acts as a moderator on
the perfectionism and PPD relationship. Finally, it is pre-
dicted that high internal LOC and low external LOC will
reduce the impact of socially prescribed perfectionism and
self-oriented perfectionism on PPD.
Method
Participants
A sample of 326 female participants, including those who
had recently given birth to those 9 months postpartum, par-
ticipated anonymously in the present study. Eighty-one
(24.8%) participants were excluded from the final analyses
due to not completing all components of the questionnaires,
leaving data for 243 participants aged 20 to 42 years (M =
30.40, SD = 4.37). Table 1 shows the key demographics for
the sample (e.g., percentage postpartum, education, and rela-
tionship status).
Materials
The demographic questionnaire included questions pertain-
ing to participants' age, sex, location, education level, mari-
tal status, and history of depression.
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox,
Holden, & Sagovsky, 1987) is designed to screen the likeli-
hood of PPD and suicidality in postpartum women. It is a
10-item scale with each item answered on a 4-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 0 to 3 with anchors varied in line
with the different questions (e.g., yes, most of the time to
hardly at all). Participants respond to statements about how
they felt over the last 7 days. A score of 9 or below is consid-
ered unlikely to have PPD; 10 to 12, possible PPD; and 13 or
above, as likely PPD (Cox et al., 1987). The scale has high
construct validity, r = .98 (Glaze & Cox, 1991) and good
internal consistency,  = .80 (Teissedre & Chabrol, 2003).
The internal consistency for the current sample was excel-
lent,  = .91.
The Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism
Scale (HP-MPS; Hewitt & Flett, 1991a, 1991b) has 45 items
measuring three subscales: Self-Oriented, Socially
Prescribed, and Other-Oriented Perfectionism. Statements
are answered on a 6-point Likert-type scale from 1 (disagree)
Jackman et al. 3
to 6 (agree). Higher scores on any one dimension indicate
unhealthier perfectionistic attitudes and behaviors. The
HP-MPS is a reliable measure of the severity of perfection-
ism dimensions, and has adequate concurrent validity and
strong test­retest reliability. Using Cronbach's alpha, the
internal consistency for the three dimensions in the current
sample was excellent for the Self-Oriented Perfectionism
subscale ( = .93), Socially Prescribed ( = .88), and Other-
Oriented Perfectionism dimensions ( = .81).
The Internal-External Locus of Control Scale (Levenson,
1973) is designed to determine LOC across three dimensions
of internal, external (chance/fate), and powerful others. The
24-item instrument consists of a series of attitude statements
that represent commonly held opinions. Participants rate
different statements on a 6-point Likert-type scale from -3
(strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree). There are eight
items on each of the three subscales; the higher the score on
a dimension, the more likely that dimension is upheld.
Twenty-four points were added to each score to reflect the 24
items. The scale has good construct validity (Levenson,
1973). The internal consistency for the scales are considered
moderate to good and range between  = .64 and  = .78
(Richardson, Field, Newton, & Bendell, 2012). For the cur-
rent sample, the internal scale was acceptable ( = 66), and
good for the external ( = .77) and powerful others scales (
= .83).
Procedure
Ethical approval was obtained from the relevant university
body (approval code HE14-126). Participants were recruited
over a period of 12 weeks from social media channels (e.g.,
postnatal depression support websites such as PANDA and
parenting forums on social media such as Canberra Mummy,
Baby Centre, and Essential Baby), and PPD support organi-
zations/groups with the facilitator's permission (e.g., posters
in community-based parenting clinics). Participants pro-
vided implied consent before commencing the surveys. The
testing materials for this project were conducted using an
online self-report questionnaire in English hosted by
QualtricsTM Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The order of
the questionnaires involved the demographics questionnaire
followed by the EPDS, HP-MPS, and LOC. At the conclu-
sion of the questionnaire, participants were thanked for their
participation and provided with information about PPD sup-
port services. The data used in this study have been made
publicly available (Jackman, Thorsteinsson, & McNeil,
2017).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were run using SPSS (version 21). Moderation
analyses were conducted using a SPSS macro, PROCESS
model 1; the settings were for 1,000 bootstrap samples for
bias correction and to establish 95% confidence intervals and
centered predictors (Hayes, 2013). To overcome any reduc-
tion in power by performing multiple moderation analyses,
one-tailed tests of significance were conducted and a larger
sample was recruited (A. Hayes, personal communication,
11 September, 2014).
Results
Of the total sample, 136 participants (56%) had unlikely
PPD, with 72 (30%) likely, and 34 (14%) possible. Table 2
shows the means, standard deviations, and correlations for
perfectionism, LOC, and PPD. Self-oriented perfectionism,
socially prescribed perfectionism, and powerful others LOC,
all showed positive correlations with PPD. All perfectionism

dimensions were correlated with one another. Internal LOC
was positively correlated with all perfectionism dimensions,
while external LOC was negatively correlated with all per-
fectionism dimensions. Powerful others LOC was only cor-
related with other-oriented perfectionism.
External LOC moderated the relationship between
socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD, predicting 7% of
the total PPD variance (Table 3). As Figure 1a shows, low
(raw b = 0.14, p < .001) and medium external LOC (raw b =
0.07, p < .001) accentuated the relationship between socially
prescribed perfectionism and PPD. As predicted, external
LOC moderated the relationship between self-oriented per-
fectionism and PPD; thus, the lower the external LOC, the
stronger the relationship, see Figure 1b. The moderation
model predicted 5% of the total PPD variance. Main effects
of external LOC (raw b = 0.22, p < .001) and self-oriented
perfectionism (raw b = 0.05, p = .006) were significant. As
Figure 1b shows, the interaction is similar to the socially pre-
scribed perfectionism and external LOC moderation model.
There was a significant relationship between self-oriented
perfectionism and PPD for participants who scored low (raw
b = 0.10, p = .03) and medium (raw b = 0.05, p = .02) exter-
nal LOC.
Internal LOC also moderated the relationship between
socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD; however, this
relationship was positive; thus, the higher the internal LOC,
the stronger the relationship. Overall, the model predicted
12% of the total PPD variance. Main effects of internal LOC
(raw b = -0.35, p < .001) and socially prescribed perfection-
ism (raw b = 0.11, p < .001) were significant. As shown in
Figure 2a, a simple slopes plot revealed a significant associa-
tion between socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD for
participants who scored low (raw b = 0.07, p = .002), medium
(raw b = 0.11, p < .001), and high (raw b = 0.15, p < .001)
internal LOC.
Internal LOC also moderated the relationship between
self-oriented perfectionism and PPD. Overall, this model
predicted 10% of the total PPD variance. Main effects of
internal LOC (raw b = -0.38, p < .001) and self-oriented
perfectionism (raw b = 0.08, p < .001) were significant. As
shown in Figure 2b, a simple slopes plot revealed the interac-
tion to be similar to the socially prescribed perfectionism,
PPD, and internal LOC relationship. A significant associa-
tion was found between self-oriented perfectionism and PPD
for participants who scored low (raw b = 0.04, p = .002),
medium (raw b = 0.08, p < .001), and high (raw b = 0.13, p <
.001) internal LOC.
Powerful others LOC moderated the socially prescribed
perfectionism and PPD relationship; thus, the lower the pow-
erful others, the stronger the relationship. The model pre-
dicted 8% of the total PPD variance, F(3, 238) = 9.87, p = .03.
Main effects of powerful others LOC (raw b = 0.21, p < .001)

and socially prescribed perfectionism (raw b = 0.07, p < .001)
were significant. Examination of the interaction revealed the
interaction to be similar to the external LOC moderation
models. A significant association was found between socially
prescribed perfectionism and PPD for participants who scored
low (raw b = 0.10, p < .001) and medium (raw b = 0.07, p <
.001) powerful others LOC.
Main effects of powerful others LOC (raw b = 0.22, p < .001)
and self-oriented perfectionism (raw b = 0.04, p = .01) were sig-
nificant. The interaction, however, was not significant (raw b =
-0.005, p = .13). Therefore, powerful others LOC did not act as
a moderator between self-oriented perfectionism and PPD.
Discussion
Self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were
positively correlated with PPD, supporting the views
that high levels of self-oriented or socially prescribed
perfectionism is a determinant to increased risk of hav-
ing PPD. This outcome also corresponds to previous
research that suggested high levels of self-oriented and
socially prescribed perfectionism may be maladaptive
and linked to depression (Shafran & Mansell, 2001).
There were also relationships between LOC and PPD in
the expected directions. There was only a weak relation-
ship between external LOC and PPD, but there were
moderate significant negative association between inter-
nal LOC and PPD, and a moderate positive association
between the powerful others LOC and PPD. As powerful
others LOC is an externally based dimension, these
results collectively signify a decreased likelihood of
PPD for people who perceive themselves to be in control
compared with people who consider external factors
responsible for their life.

The hypothesis that external LOC moderates the relation-
ship between socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD, and
the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism and
PPD, was supported. Participants with low external LOC had
a low likelihood of PPD, but only when they were low on
perfectionism. In contrast, participants with high external
LOC had a high likelihood of PPD, irrespective of their level
of perfectionism. Internal LOC strengthened the relationship
between perfectionism and PPD. Powerful others LOC had a
similar relationship with socially oriented perfectionism and
PPD as external LOC, an unsurprising result given they are
both externally based loci of control.
The moderation is consistent with the perfectionism
(Hamachek, 1978) and LOC (Rotter, 1966) theorems and
supports the claim that perfectionism at high levels is mal-
adaptive (Hamachek, 1978), as shown by the positive asso-
ciation between self-oriented and social-prescribed
perfectionism and PPD. It appears this relationship only
manifests when external LOC is high or when internal LOC
is low. This outcome reinforces Rotter's (1966) argument
that internals are more emotionally adjusted than externals. It
is possible that self-oriented perfectionists align their self-
worth with their performance; therefore, when little control
is perceived, they are more likely to have PPD (Hewitt &
Flett, 1991a). Socially prescribed perfectionists may fear
societal failure and experience cognitive dissonance, which
in turn makes them more vulnerable to depressive episodes
when minimal control is perceived (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a).
Thus, it is possible that perfectionists may be protected by
their internal LOC and that they are, consequently, less likely
to have PPD.
Socially prescribed and self-oriented perfectionism had
similar relationships with LOC but this goes against
expectations. The association between self-oriented per-
fectionism and LOC provides support for the literature
(Hewitt & Flett, 1991a). However, the socially oriented
perfection and LOC relationship outcome contradicts pre-
vious research (Periasamy & Ashby, 2002; Stewart & De
George-Walker, 2013), where socially prescribed perfec-
tionism was positively associated with internal LOC and
negatively associated with external LOC. It is possible
that socially prescribed perfectionists experience cogni-
tive dissonance and attempt to reduce the discrepancy
between their "ideal" and "actual selves" by perceiving an
internal LOC (Festinger, 1957). While this explanation is
plausible, it is more likely that these similarities are due to
the perfectionism dimensions being similar constructs
resulting in a high correlation (r = .90). Previous studies
have found mixed results with some finding overlapping
between self-oriented and socially prescribed perfection-
ism (Hewitt & Flett, 1991b), while others finding them
differentiated (Shafran & Mansell, 2001). These varia-
tions in outcome highlight the limitations of the perfec-
tionism literature failing to delineate clear dimensions of
perfectionism.
Limitations
The results of the present study are bound by the limitations
typical of cross-sectional self-report study designs. Some
women may have underestimated their symptoms due to a
social desirability bias (Boyce, 2003), while others may have
overestimated their symptoms due to a demand characteris-
tics bias (Gelabert et al., 2012). Information about previous
history of diagnosed depression ("Do you have a history of
diagnosed depression?") was sought in the survey. However,
analyses controlling for previous history of depression were
not conducted as such analyses would be underpowered as
the sample size would effectively be halved. The partici-
pants' mental health literacy levels may also have affected
the outcome (Thorsteinsson, Loi, & Moulynox, 2014) as
well as their beliefs and attitudes toward mental illness
(Gibbons, Thorsteinsson, & Loi, 2015). However, the effi-
cient nature of the self-report questionnaires contributed to a
large sample being recruited. Furthermore, the question-
naires used were reliable and valid suggesting that the data
collected are indicative of the concepts being investigated.
Future Research
Future research investigating the triad relationship between
perfectionism, LOC, and PPD should include a longitudinal
design that recruits pregnant women to determine if the rela-
tionship changes during pregnancy and through the postpar-
tum period. There is a need to increase our understanding in
the clinical realm of how perfectionism and LOC interact to
potentially contribute to PPD, which may lead to women
being screened for perfectionism during pregnancy. Future
studies might also measure time since delivery to examine if
this interval has any impact on PPD relationships.
Conclusion
The results indicate that a complex yet intuitive relationship
between LOC, perfectionism, and PPD exists. LOC exacer-
bates the perfectionism and PPD relationship indicating
women at risk of PPD are those who have self-oriented and
socially prescribed perfectionism with high external LOC or
low internal LOC. These results may be attributed to the self-
directed nature of self-oriented perfectionists. Powerful oth-
ers had a similar moderating relationship to external LOC on
socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD. This may be due
to these two loci of control being externally based. The asso-
ciation that LOC strengthens the relationship between per-
fectionism and PPD may be an important factor in the
likelihood of PPD occurring, and is a relationship that merits
further investigation.
