Introduction
Transpapillary bile duct cannulation by endo-
scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) is the technique of choice for palliative as
well as pre-operative drainage of distally obstruc-
tive jaundice. ERCP can be impossible when pre-
vious surgery or proximal digestive obstruction
has made the papilla inaccessible. In such cases,
endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage
(EUBD), a recent development of interventional
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), can be offered as
an alternative to more conventional instrumental
(percutaneous transhepatic) or surgical drainage
methods. Because EUBD is generally proposed in
the case of distal biliary obstruction, there has
been no systematic report of the results of EUBD
in the case of proximal hilar biliary obstruction.
Moreover, ERCP in non-operable hilar stenosis is
more challenging than distal obstruction, with a
failure rate of up to 27%, and lower clinical effi-
cacy, even after successful stenting.1 For these
reasons, we decided to study the outcomes of
patients treated by EUBD for proximal malignant
biliary obstruction.
Is EUS-guided drainage a suitable
alternative technique in case of proximal
biliary obstruction?

Abstract
Background: Results of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUBD) are unknown
in case of proximal stricture. The aim is to assess clinical outcomes of EUBD in patients with
malignant hilar obstruction.
Methods: Patients undergoing EUBD with hilar strictures were prospectively included.
Primary outcome was clinical success at 7 and 30 days (defined by 50% bilirubin decrease).
Secondary outcomes were technical success, procedure-related complications, length of
hospital stay, reintervention rate, survival and chemotherapy administration.
Results: Eighteen patients with a mean age of 68.8 years were included. On 15 classable
stenosis, 7 (47%) were noted Bismuth I­II, 7 (47%) Bismuth III, and 1 (6.7%) Bismuth IV.
Reasons for EUBD were surgically modified anatomy in 10 patients (55.6%), impassable
stricture at ERCP in 7 (38.9%) and duodenal obstruction in 1 (5.6%). Only hepaticogastrostomy
was performed. Clinical success was at day 7 and 30 respectively 72.2% and 68.8%. Technical
success was 94%. Complications occurred in 3 (16.7%) patients. Median (range) length of
hospital stay was 10 (6­35) days. Reintervention rate was 16.7%. Median (range) survival was
79 (5­390) days. Chemotherapy was possible in 10 (55.6%) patients.
Conclusions: EUBD is feasible for hilar obstruction for surgically altered anatomy or after
ERCP failure. Clinical outcome is satisfactory when considering underlying advanced disease,
allowing chemotherapy.

Patients and methods
Study design
This is an observational cohort study including
consecutive patients with a mostly prospective
collection of data. Out of a prospectively main-
tained and incremented database of EUS-guided
interventional procedures starting in November
2013, consecutive patients undergoing EUBD
who presented hilar bile duct obstruction were
extracted over a period of 2 years, ending in
November 2015. Inclusion criteria were: age
>18, histologically proven malignant obstruction
involving the main biliary confluence (as assessed
from MRI) with no access to the papilla or a pre-
vious failure to achieve retrograde endoscopic
drainage. Exclusion criteria included severe coag-
ulation disorders not amenable to rapid and sus-
tainable correction, large volume ascites (a small
amount of ascites was considered acceptable),
previous left hepatectomy, CT-scan or MRI
showing severe atrophy or massive tumor involve-
ment of the left liver lobe, and non-dilated bile
ducts. The study received IRB approval and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
Baseline data
Baseline demographic and biological data,
information on the patients' clinical history and
current condition were collected prospectively
on inclusion. Most short-term follow-up data
were also obtained prospectively on patient dis-
charge or from referring physicians. Additional
data, both clinical and biological, were obtained
when necessary by a retrospective review of
medical records. Endoscopic procedure details
were immediately recorded. Clinical data
included World Health Organization (WHO)
status at inclusion, underlying neoplasia, surgi-
cal history, previous interventional procedures,
significant clinical events, length of hospital
stay, medical decisions made after EUBD
(chemotherapy, care limitation), clinical events
during the first 3 months following EUBD (such
as procedure-related complications and reinter-
ventions ­ whether endoscopic or not) and sur-
vival time. Biological data included only total
serum bilirubin level (mg/dl) before drainage, 7
days and 30 days after drainage. Patients were
followed until death or date of transfer to a pal-
liative care unit.
Outcomes measures
The main outcome measure was clinical success
defined by a decrease of total serum bilirubin
level to less than half the pre-operative level within
7 (early success) and 30 days (sustained success)
of procedure.
Secondary outcome measures included technical
success (defined by the possibility of puncturing
biliary ducts and inserting a stent between the bil-
iary tree and the stomach or the duodenum), pro-
cedure-related complications (within 30 days)
and overall complications (within 3 months),
administration of chemotherapy, length of hospi-
tal stays, reintervention rate and overall survival.
Procedure
All procedures were performed in supine position
under monitored general anesthesia with airway
intubation. Prophylactic antibiotics were admin-
istered before all procedures. One endoscopist
(FP) with expertise in ERCP, EUS and EUS-BD
performed all procedures.
By using a large-channel curved linear array
echo-endoscope (GF-UCT140/180, Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan), the left hepatic duct was identi-
fied from the proximal gastric body and punc-
tured with a 19-gauge needle (EUSN-19A; Cook
Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, NC, USA). Color
Doppler was used to detect any intervening ves-
sel. After confirming bile aspiration, contrast was
injected to obtain a cholangiogram (Figure 1). A
0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire; Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA, USA) was then advanced into the
intrahepatic biliary ducts. The needle was
removed, and the track was coagulated by using a
6 Fr cystostome (Endoflex, Belgium) to facilitate
the insertion of a 10 mm large fully covered self-
expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) (WallFlex;
Boston Scientific or Hanarostent, MI-Tech, Life
Partners Europe, Bagnolet, France), generally 80
mm in length, in the left hepatic duct. When the
right liver bile ducts appeared to be accessible
from the left ducts, an uncovered SEMS bridging
the confluence (Zilverstent; Cook Medical) was
inserted after guidewire cannulation and balloon
dilation if necessary, and before FCSEMS
transgastric placement (Figures 2 and 3). A sin-
gle hemostatic clip was generally used to secure
the gastric stent end and reduce the risk of stent
migration.

rubin levels are expressed as mean (± SD).
Results
Patients
During the study period, 18 patients fulfilled the
inclusion criteria, out of 52 undergoing EUBD
and 3159 referred to our center for ERCP. All 18
patients had EUBD by the transgastric route. A
flow chart displays patient selection (Figure 4).
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. All
patients had clinical jaundice at the time of
EUBD, but general condition remained good or
fair in most patients. The main cause of biliary
obstruction was loco-regional recurrence of previ-
ously resected biliary (n = 2), gastric (n = 1), and
pancreatic (n = 3) adenocarcinoma in six patients
(33.3%) followed by hepatic hilar metastases in
four patients (22.2%) from colorectal adenocarci-
noma (n = 3) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(n = 1). Pancreatic mass from metastatic adeno-
carcinoma (n = 3, 16.7%), primary hilar cholan-
giocarcinoma (Klatskin's tumor) (n = 3,16.7%)
and peritoneal carcinomatosis in two patients
(7.6%) from gastric (n = 1) and pancreatic cancers
(n = 1) represented following causes of obstruc-
tion. Because of previous hepatectomy, only 15
patients presented classable stenosis on Bismuth
Classification. Thus, we had seven (47%) patients
with Bismuth I­II stenosis, seven (47%) patients
with Bismuth III stenosis and one (6.7%) with
Bismuth IV stenosis. ERCP was not achievable in
10 patients (55.6%) as a consequence of a modified
anatomy after total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y
oeso-jejunal anastomosis (n = 3), duodenopan-
createctomy with Roux-en Y gastro-jejunal

anastomosis (n = 4), or palliative Roux-en-Y
reconstruction (n = 3). Other reasons for failure
or preclusion of transpapillary drainage were
impassable hilar stricture in seven cases (38.9%)
and duodenal obstruction caused by pancreatic
head carcinoma in one case (5.6%)
Three patients (16.7%) presented with tissular
infiltration of a hepatico-jejunal anastomosis after
right hepatectomy involving the hilum; the other
15 (83.3%) had an advanced hilar stricture. A
clip was used to avoid migration in seven patients
(38.9%).
Outcome of endoscopic ultrasound-guided
biliary drainage
Outcome results are shown in Table 2. EUBD
was technically successful in 17 patients (techni-
cal success rate = 94%).
Early clinical success (within seven days of EUBD
procedure) was observed in 13 out of 18 patients
(72.2%). Two patients died of advanced cancer,
but without biliary complications at 10 and 11
days. Sustained clinical success at 30 days was
observed in 11 of the 16 remaining patients
(68.8%). Total bilirubin mean (±SD) serum
level declined from 12.1 (±7.2) mg/dl to 6.5(±5)
mg/dl at 1 week and 3.8 (±5.8) mg/dl at 1 month,
a decrease of respectively 46.3% and 68.6% from
baseline, as represented in Figure 5.
Attempts to bridge-stent the main confluence
were successful in three out of six procedures
(50%) for five patients (three unsuccessful
attempts in two patients for tight hilar strictures).
Among those patients with attempted bridge-
trans-hilar stenting, specific early and sustained
clinical success was 60% (3/5).
When advanced strictures were considered
(>Bismuth II) regarding eight patients, early
and sustained success was observed in five
patients (62.5%) for whom four bridge-stent
hilar stenting were attempted in three patients
and all achieved.
Reinterventions were needed in three patients
(16.7%) after one case of migration of the hepa-
tico-gastric stent and two failure cases of bridge-
trans-hilar stenting. Median and mean lengths of
hospital stay after EUBD were respectively 10
(6­35) and 12.8 (±7.8) days, and median and
mean overall survivals were respectively 93 (5­410)
and 133.8 (127.7) days. Three procedure-related
complications were observed (16.7%). One
patient developed a severe hemorrhage at the
point of gastro-hepatic puncture 5 days after
EUBD, causing the only procedure-related death
of the study. One jaundice observed 60 days after
EUBD was deemed secondary to the transgastric
FCSEMS clogging, but no attempt at stent desob-
struction was undertaken after collegial decision
to limit care in a patient with a terminal-stage

pancreatic cancer. The third complication
observed was a stent migration 2 months after
procedure, treated with a new procedure. No case
of peritoneal bile leak was observed. Within
30 days of EUBD, chemotherapy was resumed in

Discussion
This observational study is dedicated to the out-
come of EUBD in case of proximal biliary
obstruction. Many reports have recently shown
that EUBD is an interesting technique when
ERCP is not possible, whether due to a surgically
altered anatomy or to a proximal gastroduodenal
obstruction.2­5 However, since the right liver
accounts for approximately 60­70% of the hepa-
tocellular mass and EUBD gives access in most
cases to the left ducts (except, but randomly, in
case of transduodenal EUBD), this technique
tends to be limited to distal obstruction, in which
all EUBD approaches (transduodenal, transgas-
tric and by transhepatic rendezvous) are in theory
equally valid.4,6,7 The common approach to cases
of hilar obstruction after ERCP failure or when
access to the major papilla is barred is to refer the
patient to the interventional radiologist for a per-
cutaneous transhepatic drainage, in which case
left and right liver accesses are available and
multiple stenting is possible even for advanced
strictures. However, percutaneous drainage is
associated with higher morbidity than ERCP and
is not recommended in case of ascites and mas-
sive one-sided tumor involvement, thus some-
times restricting available access routes.8­10 The
other alternative interventional option of enteros-
copy-guided retrograde drainage is poorly attrac-
tive since papillary access is successful in only
60­70% of patients, is very time-consuming and
has few drainage options for advanced strictures
as a consequence of small scope working channel
and fewer ancillary devices to conduct complex
procedures.4 It was therefore interesting to inves-
tigate to what extent EUBD could provide jaun-
dice relief even when limited to the left liver lobe,
with the knowledge acquired from ERCP studies
showing that in selected cases one-sided ERCP
drainage of advanced hilar strictures could be effi-
cient.1,11 Our study shows that EUBD in such
patients has a high technical success rate (94%),
which was expected, but also a satisfactory rate of
clinical success (around 70%), allowing patients
to receive additional chemotherapy (55.6%)
otherwise precluded by obstructive jaundice, and
a low rate of complications (16.7%).
Technical EUBD success rate was similar to other
EUBD studies.12 In only one patient did the left
duct puncture and stenting fail because bile ducts
were not dilated. When comparing patients in this
study with our experience of EUBD in patients
with distal obstruction, we found a similar techni-
cal success rate (100%). It is important to note
that all patients with proximal obstruction in our
series had EUBD through the transgastric route.
This approach has been preferred in our experi-
ence for its absence of significant infectious com-
plications and possibly lower rate of bile leaks.
Moreover, EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy is
often the only available EUBD option, since the
transduodenal route does not permit the punc-
ture of intrahepatic ducts and the rendezvous
technique is either impossible (previous surgery)
or difficult for the same reasons that led to ERCP
failure.12
Clinical success rates in the range of 75­100%
have been reported after EUBD, but poorly
defined criteria for clinical success and inclusion of
mostly distal strictures may account for the differ-
ence, with a much higher chance of rapid jaundice
relief in distal strictures.12 In our own experience of
EUBD in distal biliary strictures, clinical success
was 86%.13 Moreover, since it has been previously
proven that draining >50% of the liver volume
may be an important predictor of success (espe-
cially in advanced Bismuth III­IV hilar strictures),
left lobe drainage could be sufficient in patients
with a large left liver.1,11,14 However, clinical suc-
cess was more rapid when bridging the obstructed
main confluence with an uncovered stent when
successfully attempted, although 3/5 such attempts
failed. Such procedures can be very demanding
and must probably be attempted in only some spe-
cific, carefully selected cases, when the right­left
balance of functional liver mass suggests a particu-
lar advantage of draining at least part of the right
lobe and provided that guidewire loops in the
hilum can be avoided or reduced before reaching
the right sectors.
Artifon and colleagues, in a single-center randomized
study, did not find any difference after ERCP failure
between EUS-choledochoduodenostomy and percu-
taneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in
terms of efficacy and safety, but only distal stenosis
were studied (malignant involvement of the second
F Moryoussef, A Sportes et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 543
portion of the duodenum and the major papilla).15
In a recent work of percutaneous transhepatic bil-
iary metal stenting for malignant hilar obstruction
looking at predictive factors for efficacy in 159
patients from a single center, Li and colleagues
reported a technical success rate of 100% and a
clinical success of 71.4%.16 These outcomes are
similar to ours, except that clinical success in Li's
study was defined by a decrease of only 30% at 7
days. Morbidity results from Li's study (26.4%)
suggest more severe and more frequent complica-
tions than after EUBD. Direct comparisons with
our results are not possible, but this indicates that
EUBD and PTBD might have similar efficacies in
hilar obstructions. Moreover, PTBD may need
reinterventions especially when the most com-
mon two-step approach is chosen, with an exter-
nal drain in place for a few days before stenting.
As with Artifon and colleagues, a recent prospec-
tive study comparing EUBD in our center and
PTBD by an expert interventional radiologist
for proximal and distal biliary obstruction found
similar success and adverse events rate but a lower
number of reintervention and length of hospitali-
zation favoring EUBD.
As long as a patient with non-curable malignant
disease remains in fair condition and is willing to
undergo additional treatments to extend survival
and improve comfort, the current trend in clinical
oncology is to offer chemotherapy whenever
possible. Most chemotherapy requires good
liver function and an effective biliary clearance.
Effective biliary drainage is therefore a prerequi-
site, not only for the patient's quality of life and
nutritional stabilization, but also to allow chemo-
therapy to be administered. We found no pub-
lished result of that kind in EUBD studies, but in
a retrospective study of 71 patients with advanced
solid malignancies and hilar biliary obstruction
treated with PTBD, chemotherapy administra-
tion was possible in 55% of patients17 ­ that is,
exactly the same rate as in the present study.
Moreover, EUBD in this subgroup of patients
who could receive chemotherapy allowed high
overall survival at 210 (32­390) days.
The complication rate of 16.7% is lower than the
22% rate reported in Park's meta-analysis,12 and
can be deemed acceptable, but it must be noted
that one of our patients died from severe bleeding
a few days after EUBD. Bleeding and bile leak are
the two most serious complications to be antici-
pated after EUBD and must be prevented as
much as possible by a perfect correction of coagu-
lation and an expert handling of the EUBD
procedure.
The present work presented one main limitation,
which was the small number of patients because
EUBD after ERCP failure is not well known
among oncologists, who still address patients for
PTBD.
Conclusion
EUBD is a feasible and effective technique for
proximal biliary obstruction after ERCP failure,
as well as in patients with surgically altered anat-
omy. Bridge-trans-hilar stenting can be attempted
in selected cases, with a lower feasibility rate but
good clinical outcome when successful. EUBD
can make chemotherapy feasible.
