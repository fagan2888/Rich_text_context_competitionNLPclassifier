Context and pressures for change
New public management (NPM) has been built around private sector techniques of
enterprise regulation, coordination, and control, and reflects a sense of their innate
superiority (Osborne and McLaughlin, 2002; Willcox and Harrow, 1992). The essence
of NPM has been summarised as `managers, markets, and measurement' (Ferlie et al,
1996), although differing degrees of emphasis can be identified and there is some minor
disagreement in the literature over the nature of the key features of NPM (Butterfield
et al, 2005). Cope et al (1997) and Butterfield et al (2005) provide interesting reviews of
NPM as it pertains to the police service in Britain, stressing the importance of the
`practitioner manager' in changing managerial roles and the reassignment of strategic
responsibilities. The police, caricatured as the service industry where the customer is
always wrong (Squires, 1998, page 169), has presented NPM with a serious challenge
during both its Conservative and its New Labour manifestations (Newman, 2002).
In this paper we focus upon the sociotechnical issues (Trist et al, 1963) that are integral
to the current NPM reform process.
Commentators have been aware of the unique challenge of police management for
many years. For example, the Shortt report of 1924:
``A constable is entrusted with powers that may gravely affect the liberty of the subject
and he must be ready to act on his own initiative in all sorts of contingencies.
The burden of individual discretion placed upon a constable is much greater than
that of any other public servant.''

Abstract. This paper presents a review and interpretation of the apparent inertia and resistance to
change that has characterised the last twenty-five years of UK policing. We argue that attempts
to introduce New Public Management to policing have not proved as effective as in other public
services. Most of the activities of the police have explicitly spatial consequences yet, we argue, the
slow diffusion and adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) and other technical innovations
has been a particular issue. The current round of political aspirations to reform policing depend in
large part on a rapid increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of police management information
systems and their deployment at strategic and tactical levels. Generic opportunities and constraints
arising in the field of geographic information science are identified and summarised followed by a
critical appreciation of current GIS deployment in policing. Direct practical experience in GIS
policing applications is used to outline observed barriers to progress and also forms the basis for a
number of strategic recommendations.

Elsewhere, we have suggested that constabulary discretion tends to disable senior line
managers' attempts to initiate change and to control the quality of outputs (Irving and
Bourne, 2002; Irving et al, 1996).
As a prologue to the Thatcher public service marketisation and privatisation reform
programme (Ascher, 1987), there was a relentless build up of official criticisms of the
quality of policing. Sir Robert Mark's battle against corruption in the Metropolitan
Police (Cox et al, 1977) was followed by exposure of dubious CID methods in the
Maxwell Confait murder investigation (Fisher, 1977). By then, such a body of evidence
about police malpractice had accumulated that a Royal Commission was inevitable.
The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure's report (1980), the first to be based
extensively on empirical research, revealed unacceptable practices, poor management,
and ineffective administrative procedures.
The litany of bad news continued with Lord Scarman's report on the Brixton riots
(1981) which criticised Metropolitan Police management for its unjust and heavy-
handed approach to the community. Two years later, the Policy Studies Institute's
classic study of the policing of London (Smith et al, 1983) confirmed and elaborated
many of Scarman's judgments.
Constructive responses to this very public stream of bad news flowed from two
sources: the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 created a new legislative frame-
work for managing and controlling criminal investigation. However, it was the
Metropolitan Police itself, under Sir Kenneth Newman, that initiated the police
service's own comprehensive management-reform process. Newman also continued
to support the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment that he had inherited from his
predecessor, Sir David McNee, and which had been the most immediate product of
Scarman's criticisms (Irving et al, 1989). This experiment, designed for and by police
officers (Beckett and Hart, 1981), sought to achieve exactly the kind of localism
and devolution of operational strategy making that now sits at the core of the
contemporary reform agenda (Home Office, 2001; 2004a). Similarly, Sir Kenneth
Newman's corporate planning and performance-management system foreshadowed
Home Office NPM initiatives of the early 1990s (Hough, 2003; Loveday and Reid,
2003, pages 13 ^ 15).
Neither Sir Kenneth Newman nor his successor, Sir Peter (later Lord) Imbert,
could make any impact on the rising crime rate (Home Office, 1993a; Mirrlees-Black
et al, 1996). Meanwhile, successive Home Secretaries (Kenneth Baker and Ken Clarke)
pursued the NPM initiative. As Maguire (1997, pages 170 ^ 172) concluded, there were
sufficient ways of interpreting crime rates through the late 1980s and early 1990s to give
ammunition to most political agendas, and certainly they could be presented to make
police reform look essential.
Sir Patrick Sheehy's (1993) report on police responsibilities and rewards was
intended to pave the way for the NPM reform programme by removing inflexibil-
ity in police organisational structures, rules, and procedures. The Police Reform
White Paper (Home Office, 1993b) assumes successful implementation of Sheehy's
recommendations. In fact, concerted and effective resistance from the service left the
police virtually unaffected (McLaughlin and Murji, 1993). Twin investigations of police
roles and responsibilities, one from the Home Office (Posen, 1994), one indepen-
dent (Police Foundation and Policy Studies Institute, 1994), briefly raised the issue of
privatisation, a stalwart of Thatcherite NPM (Walsh, 1995), but without any immediate
effect.
The Police Reform White paper of 1993 laid out no real plans for setting, much
less achieving, goals. Sheehy's 232 recommendations might have produced a new era
in police management if they had not been so strenuously resisted (Caines, 1994).
160 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley
The Police and Magistrates Courts Act of 1994 certainly gave the Home Secretary new
powers to set national policing objectives, supported by measurable performance
indicators. It also required more explicit articulation of local policing plans, with local
objective setting (Hough, 2003). However, these long legislative levers were never
attached to any appropriate gearing mechanism to reach down into the service itself.
Two seminal Audit Commission reports (1993; 1996) provided the service with
expert-practice guides in an attempt to lift performance in criminal investigation and
patrol management. However, these guides relied heavily on feeding back to the service
in authoritative and accessible form what expert informants on the inside told Audit
Commission researchers. In drawing upon the experience of Neighbourhood Policing,
some accounts tended to excise the problems and criticisms that had emerged during
the experiment (Irving et al, 1989; Turner, 1986).(1) There is certainly no sign of
appropriate caveats in the Audit Commission's handbooks. In fact, before the 1993
Conservative police-reform watershed, the service itself had completed a unique
Operational Review involving all three representative organisations (ACPO et al, 1990).
This important critique identified a clear disparity between police and public priorities
for the service, and started a process of internal debate about change which Sheehy
managed to dissipate. It can also be argued that neither the Audit Commission reports
nor the Sheehy report give a sense of the extraordinary difficulties involved in coor-
dinating, controlling, and improving federated ranks' response to strategic redirection
(Irving and Bourne, 2002; Irving et al, 1996).
NPM and the police under New Labour
New Labour's attempts to outperform Conservative efforts to apply NPM reforms to
the police service have been admirably summarised and cogently criticised by Loveday
and Reid (2003). They adduce evidence that steady centralisation and the micro-
management of police operations from Whitehall have been largely ineffective (pages
25 ^ 28). They also present powerful and persuasive expert opinion as to the distorting
effect of facile performance measurement on policing operations (page 19).
Since 1997 successive Home Office initiatives aimed at top-down reform of policing
from the Home Office have taken the NPM mission to a new phase. Newman (2002)
has produced a timely and helpful account of this evolution that seeks to explain
resistance and the slow pace of change in the face of so much political enthusiasm.
Two factors are singled out. First, she cites the limitations imposed by the technical
means available to achieve political ends. Second, she acknowledges the inertia of
established institutions, particularly in the face of unresolvable tensions between eco-
nomic and social goals in public service provision. The professions, as traditional
managers of these tensions, resent and resist governmental interference (Broadbent
and Laughlin, 2002, page 105).
Although it was not apparent in the academic consultation exercise which preceded
its publication (Irving, 2004) the latest Police Reform White Paper (Home Office,
2004a) is itself something of a model of improved NPM. This includes new commit-
ments to more specific means of delivery, and greater recognition of the realities of
local police management. In particular, the need to improve middle management's
skills is properly recognised.
We shall try to complement this welcome trend by focusing attention on a critical
element in the `means to ends' equation. The White Paper (Home Office, 2004a) credits
(1) Some of those closely involved in the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment maintained a dialogue
with the Police Foundation as they were promoted through the ranks to senior levels in the service.
This conclusion is drawn from unpublished notes of that dialogue made by Irving between 1992 and
1998. This can be verified by comparing Audit Commission and Neighbourhood Policing reports.
Police reform and the new public management paradigm 161
the National Intelligence Model with being the ``single most significant nationally
implemented change (in policing)'' (paragraph 2.4). There are significant aspirations to
``increase the responsiveness and customer service of the police'' (paragraph 2.18 ^ 22)
and the use of market-analysis tools in this respect is recommended (page 56).
The new Neighbourhood Policing mandate is to be intelligence led and proactive. If
these aspirations are to be approached without defeating the pledge to reduce bureau-
cracy (paragraph 3.19), local policing management will need a rapid and consistent
improvement in the availability of smart information handling capacity. Moreover,
local managers will need rapidly to increase their ability to use such smart systems
effectively. The White Paper implicitly acknowledges the challenge this poses by
highlighting the ``lessons from Bichard and the Soham case'' (Home Office, 2004a,
page 105).(2)
The police management challenge and the critical role of information technology
The Police Reform White Paper (Home Office, 2004a, page 1) vaunts the increase in
officer numbers to 140 000, with the addition of 4000 community support officers. These
figures need to be contextualised: consideration of time and space quickly diminish
their power to impress. Even assuming that all available personnel are engaged in
core policing tasks, they must still be divided between four basic shifts.(3) Thus, there
are an absolute maximum of 36 000 officers at any one time to cover 53 million citizens
dispersed over 151000 ha. This is equivalent to one officer per 1500 people and 4 ha.
These crude figures gloss over considerable variability between Basic Command Units
(Mawby and Wright, 2003, pages 174 ^ 175). However, crime is concentrated in areas of
highest population density where the nature of the built environment creates special
problems for police surveillance (Audit Commission, 1996). Into this time ^ space ^
personnel equation, the public push about ten crime reports a minute. Because these
events are distributed according to a heavily skewed, or Poisson, process (Farrington
and Welsh, 2004, page 451) and tend to cluster in time and space (Marchant, 2004),
it follows that at any one time, assuming a fair distribution of police resources across
the country, a minority of patrol officers will be seriously overstretched whereas the
majority will be relatively underemployed.
Reiner (1997, pages 1008 ^ 1011) summarises the nature and operation of police
discretion as an institutional and individual response to this problematic workload.
Manning (1977), in an enduringly useful metaphor, characterises police work as stage
managing public perception by creating the illusion of control. These accounts and
explanations, arising from the criminology literature, do not acknowledge the simi-
larities between the police service and many other enterprises.(4) Input resources are
always limited, production processes are always less efficient than would be ideal,
and consumer demand for product is fickle, often irrational, and, without the control
of price, potentially insatiable. The static role of management is to order operational
processes so that, notwithstanding these difficulties, the total return on investment
in inputs is optimised. The dynamic role is to foresee and forestall environmental,
sociotechnical, and market perturbations (Burnes, 2000, pages 48 ^ 53; Eden and
Ackermann, 1998, page 33; Handy, 1999, page 15). Moreover, Nolan et al (2004, page 102)
argue that because the police are expected to manage problems resulting from social
processes far beyond their control, much police effort is thus devoted to asserting the
false impression that they are, in fact, controlling the problems.

report (Bichard Inquiry, 2004).

162 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley
Geographic information systems (GIS) provide much of the technology backbone
to local governmentövarious estimates suggest that 70% ^ 80% of local government
work involves GIS in some way, and inventory-analysis applications are legion. Yet the
potential of GIS to represent the characteristics of local populations remains very
underexploited in the delivery of public services, and local service delivery in policing
(and also in education and health) seems to assume a passive population undifferen-
tiated in attitudes, expectations, or even needs. In short, today's consumer-led public
services remain very much less sophisticated in targeting services than their counter-
parts in the private sectoröalmost every public-facing part of the retail sector has had
geodemographic segmentation systems for years, if not decades.
In general terms, GIS make it possible to devise practical, rational measures of local
service demand, as well as facilitating transparent assessment of current performance
levels relative to locationally sensitive measures of need. In relation to specific urban
services, GIS can be used to anticipate and accommodate the priorities and preferences
of local communities in terms of how services are delivered, or create the opportu-
nity to achieve savings by targeting communication programmes to populations for
whom their messages are most appropriate (as, for example, with Neighbourhood
Watch schemes in policing, or primary health care interventions). Chan (2003, pages
655 ^ 676) provides a recent summary assessment of the impact of new technologies on
policing. In doing so, she echoes the conclusions of the general change and strategy
theorists quoted above. New technology, such as GIS, is absorbed into and modified
by an organisational culture (Chan, 2003, pages 668 ^ 669; Trist et al, 1963).
Perhaps inevitably, new technology usually creates winners and losers and disturbs
existing power relations (Chan, 2003, page 664; Eden and Ackermann, 1998, page 47).
Technological systems have their own inefficiencies: the success of a technology is
contingent on appropriate choice and implementation (Burnes, 2000, pages 80 ^ 87;
Chan, 2003, pages 665 ^ 668). These insights, at least in the management sciences,
are usually a prelude to instrumental action: unblocking resistance and creating and
implementing effective change strategy (Burnes, 2000, page 155). However, progress in
policing since 1980 has been painstakingly slow.
Innovation in policing
Beckett and Hart's (1981) Neighbourhood Policing strategy was built in twenty years
of US legal realism research (Goldstein, 1979). A central plank of the strategy was
that the basic policing needs of communities could be met only if police used scientific
and information technology (IT) methods to order and control the flow of infor-
mation with which they had to deal (Beckett and Hart, 1981). It was on this basis
that the Metropolitan Police Neighbourhood Policing team commissioned the first
local personal computer (PC)-based police information-handling system in the United
Kingdom and initiated the development of CRIS, the ambitious force-wide Crime
Reporting and Information System (see Turner, 1986, chart 11).
Early community-policing specialists in the United Kingdom, notably John Alderson
in Devon and Cornwall (Alderson, 1979), were well aware of the interdependence
between spatiotemporal crime mapping and the practical application of Goldstein's
problem-oriented approach. Although the Neighbourhood Policing IT plans do not
stretch to mapping software, it was intended that their outputs should provide the basis
for crime-pattern analysis (Beckett and Hart, 1981).
By the mid-1980s Professor Stan Openshaw was already developing what was
to be the basis of the first smart crime pattern analysis software in the United
Kingdom. At the same time Sir Stanley Bailey, Chief Constable of Northumbria,
was importing crime and incident recording concepts from the USA that were to
Police reform and the new public management paradigm 163
make Openshaw's ideas practicable by the end of the decade. However, in London the
difficulties of implementing area-based information-management systems during
the life of the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment (1981 ^ 89) are evident in Turner's
(1986) evaluation report. The slow progress in the development of CRIS and its
parallel offender-recording system, CRIMINT, can be charted through contemporary
policy documents (Imbert, 1992; Williamson, 1988, page 103). In fact these systems in
the United Kingdom's premier police force were still incapable of performing smart
geodemographic crime pattern analysis in 2001 (Irving et al, 2001).
The IT difficulties that emerged during the Neighbourhood Policing project
convinced the Police Foundation of the need to invest in the development of crime
pattern analysis software. Between 1989 and 1995, the Police Foundation, Northumbria
Police, and Newcastle University (Centre for Urban and Rural Development Studies)
jointly developed an appropriate crime and incident mapping system which was com-
mercialised by Forensic Technology Ltd, which was taken over by ABM Ltd in 1998.(5)
It is ironic that, if the Home Office had supported this development process in its early
years, police forces in the United Kingdom would have had for free what they now
have to acquire at standard commercial prices. ABM's PROphecy system was acquired
by the much-praised New York Police Department in 2004.
Cope (2003, page 355 et seq.) describes the problems associated with the intro-
duction of crime-pattern analysis and associated IT: the quality of data, data-input
and back-record conversion difficulties, the relative inefficiency of analytic algorithms,
the insufficiency of background research, and so on. What is missing is an assessment
of the efficacy of technological support provided to police managers by force IT
departments and their central government mentors.
In an attempt to understand the sociotechnical constraints on the introduction
and development of IT-led police project and performance management, Irving fol-
lowed the fortunes of a Problem Oriented Policing project in Thames Valley and
Northumbria (Irving and Dixon, 2002). In large part, the failure of the project
could be ascribed to lack of appropriate IT support and training which even negated
the effect of Northumbria's nominal software superiority. Moreover, Northumbria's
analytic capability appeared to have degenerated since the end of the force's active
involvement in relevant research and development.
In the conclusion to their report, Irving and Dixon (2002) comment on the police
service's poor record in managing technical innovation and recommend that the Home
Office pay more attention to forces' capacity and capability to undertake and champion
innovation. This recommendation harks back to a previous paper on the diffusion
of innovation prepared for the Home Office (Faulkner and Irving, 1994). This recom-
mendation in relation to project IT support was again tested in an early phase of the
National Reassurance Policing Programme. Participating forces' IT capability to
support problem-oriented policing strategies at local community level was found to be
generally unsatisfactory and in urgent need of rectification to render the wider project
viable (Irving, 2003).
This brief history of one important aspect of change and innovation management
in the police service provides some compelling evidence that NPM aspirations to
mimic private sector use of technology to improve organisational efficiency may be
problematic. Where no other means of improvement are available, the NPM mission
would seem to depend on investing more in understanding the dynamics of innova-
tion lag in policing. To this end, we go on to look at a particular emerging avenue of
technical innovation in crime-pattern analysis; and consider the gap between its
management potential and its take-up, and how that gap might be reduced.

Knowledge base and technology: opportunities and constraints
Opportunities
Technology is clearly necessary, but not sufficient, for success in implementing an
effective criminal justice system. Some of the key technology trends that will shape
the technological setting to criminal justice reform and neighbourhood policing in the
rest of this decade include:
(1) Data sharing under agreed protocols and subject to robust user-authentication
procedures.
(2) Services-oriented architecturesöweb services will make it much easier to integrate
technology into neighbourhood-based policing strategies, and will drive the acceptance
and adoption of technology by those charged with implementing policies.
(3) Spatial data infrastructures (SDI) and portalsöaccess to data is still a constraint on
GIS, and top-down programs that organize data access via web portals will alleviate
these problems.
(4) Sensory websönew hardware and network developments now allow low-cost sensors
to be placed in many more remote locations (for example, in vehicles, or on people).
These can track and monitor objects that move or change state, and can relay this
information to central GIS logging and analysis systems. These open up many new
applications for GIS in neighbourhood policing.
(5) Modelling and analysisöour ability to perform GIScience is being enhanced by the
availability of improved software for spatial analysis and modelling. Key develop-
ments in GIS include both exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), and developments
in inferential statistics. Techniques that are sensitive to local context without sacrific-
ing the power of generalisation are also importantösuch as geographically weighted
regression [GWR (Fotheringham et al, 2002)].
(6) Data managementöinformation systems now have vastly improved facilities for
measuring and monitoring changes in systems in real time, and for accommodating
multiuser transactions.
(7) Mobile technologiesöfor example, hand-held GIS which incorporate global posi-
tioning systems (GPS). A portable GIS may be used for reporting policing activity and
extend to the extended policing family, for example, neighbourhood wardens reporting
`envirocrime' such as graffiti, fly-tipping, and vandalism whereby real-time mapping
GPS and GPRS (global packet radio service) technologies are used to report incident
locations to a central GIS database thus enabling rapid and appropriate response
strategies (see Kilroy, 2004).
(8) Visualisationöthe ability to visualise geographic data in conventional two-dimen-
sional maps and three-dimensional representations is already providing new scientific
insights, as well as helping to popularise GIS-based representations of localities. For
example, ESRI ArcGlobe has been used at University College London to bring
together information on socioeconomic distributions (fear of crime) with built environ-
ments, and this kind of approach may allow police forces to understand the physical
context of neighbourhood satisfaction with reassurance policing better.
Such tools and technologies are, however, applied in particular institutional and
organisational contexts. As such, constraints may pertain to the external operating
environment (such as data-protection legislation), or to the particular setting in which
policy is formulated.
Constraints
Accessibility
In spite of broad public familiarity with geographic and the simpler GIScience con-
cepts through exposure to education and the Internet, there is evidence that more
Police reform and the new public management paradigm 165
advanced GIScience and its applications exclude a large number of potential users
and beneficiaries because of their complex statistical and computing base. They may
also disenfranchise some of those who might otherwise wish or need to appreciate
the basis on which current GIS users make strategic and tactical decisions that affect
them.
Many of the insights gained from applications of GIScience are counterintuitive
and counterexperiential. Public trust and confidence in GIScience depends on improv-
ing current levels of accessibility. Software needs to be more user-friendly and to be
fail-safe in the hands of inexpert practitioners.
The quality of geodemographic data infrastructures
As geodemographic data sources proliferate, extracting valid and reliable information
from them to apply to public service operational decision making becomes more of
a challenge. Dedication to unsatisfactory data by dint of previous investment, or force
of habit and convenience, undermines the management process that GIScience is
intended to support and improve. Zonally coarse, infrequently collected, unstable,
or otherwise inappropriate and inaccurate data can marginalise and/or disempower
individuals, groups, and communities when important public sector investment
and resource-deployment decisions are made on an empirical geodemographic basis.
Poor geographic data and information extraction defeat the very moral political and
ideological ends that its use is meant to serve.
Modelling and visualising complexity
The current generation of GIS have limitations in their ability to represent real geo-
graphic phenomena, particularly their dynamics. In the best of all possible worlds,
GIS would include data models for all types of geographic phenomena, including those
that are well beyond the range of currently supported data models. It is impossible,
for example, to build effective representations today of phenomena such as crime hot
spots that simultaneously move, change shape, and change internal structure. Many
more examples exist, leading us to suggest that the development of data models
for complex geographic phenomena should be given high priority by the GIScience
research community.
The effects of ontological anxiety
Threats to community security transmitted and amplified by commercial media hungry
for audiences and politicians hungry for votes are creating an ontological form of
anxiety (Giddens, 1991). Military and security-service investment in surveillance, fuelled
by public and political concern, has created an unparalleled flow of geographical data
which GIScience can help turn into useful warnings, risk assessments, and general
intelligence. But the very anxiety that helps to create the necessary investment to
produce this flow tends to keep the product hidden from many of those who are best
placed to help with the extraction and interpretation processes.
Feeding the technology with adequate science
Recent advances in GIS modelling and analysis may be helping us to model the world
better and to test ever more sophisticated hypotheses about the future in respect, for
example, of climate and population change. However, the utility of this increase in
modelling capability depends on the adequacy of the scientific explanatory paradigms
available to select variables, define relationship algorithms, and interpret outputs.
The better the modelling, the more severe the test on the scientific backupöwitness
the state of the climate-change debate.
166 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley
Police reform, local management, and technological innovation
The new localism philosophy of central government establishes community engagement,
citizen-focused service delivery, and the neighbourhood at the heart of policy and its
delivery management. However, in spite of significant reform in strategic management
structures, performance-assessment frameworks, and the focused redistribution of
resources across the criminal justice system, many outputs and outcomes fail to
substantiate the political rhetoric surrounding the local, the neighbourhood, and the
community (Ashby, 2005). The most recent Police Reform White Paper explicitly calls
for effective engagement strategies from the police service, which necessarily require
a ``detailed, neighbourhood level understanding of the demographics of the community
it serves'' (Home Office, 2004a, page 67). However, it is our experience that such a
detailed appreciation of local populations is usually lacking in UK policing.
Moreover, although the public may reasonably expect their local police to retain a
detailed knowledge of crime hot spots, evidence suggests that police perceptions are
usually at odds with evidence-based computer-generated hot-spot maps (Ratcliffe and
McCullagh, 2001, page 336). Furthermore, commentators have consistently argued
that, given the nature of operational policing, officers are most unlikely to identify
subtle and intricate differences in performance between neighbourhoods (see Ashby,
2005; Scott, 1998). Similarly, in those areas where policing response to incidents is low,
variation in concerns, anxieties, and fears in the community are unlikely to be
observed whilst operating under traditional reactive policing strategies. In recognition
of such arguments, significant resource commitments, research, and political rhetoric
surrounds terms such as `citizen-focused service delivery', `neighbourhood policing',
and `reassurance policing'. Although such evidence challenges the maxim that a `good
copper knows his beat', large sectors of the police service have been slow to adopt
much of the technological and analytical expertise which may help rectify the disparity
between external expectations, police perceptions, and reality.
GIS and crime mapping is proving to be of mounting importance in policing, with
a wide range and increasing number of application texts (for example, Chainey and
Ratcliffe, 2005; Harries, 1999; Hirschfield and Bowers, 2001; Ratcliffe, 2000; 2002a),
formal fora (the US National Institute of Justice held its Eighth Annual International
Crime Mapping Conference in September 2005), and online discussion outlets [for
example, the CrimeMap listserv(6)] both for practitioners and for researchers. Further-
more, the Home Office has recently commissioned a good-practice guide on crime
mapping in policing and an evaluation of the various GIS-based information-sharing
systems currently utilised across the United Kingdom. However, the very fact that central
government needs to conduct such assessments and evaluations suggests that there is
currently a lack of cohesion and consensus on the subject, leading to different practices
(at worst, conflicting; at best, inefficient) across the forces of the United Kingdom.
Ratcliffe (2002b, page 63) corroborates these concerns, citing mismatches between
databases, GIS software functionality, user expertise, and intelligence needs.
Although the increased focus on geospatial technologies is welcome, the predom-
inant applications for crime mapping in UK Basic Command Units remain relatively
unsophisticated and often only tactical in nature. Mirroring the US example of
CompStat, the geographical plotting and spatial analysis of recent UK crime trends
in tactical briefings is probably the most advanced and high-impact current use of
spatial techniques. These techniques commonly identify the extent and location of a
crime problem, and form a basis for subsequent targeting of police resources. Notwith-
standing command and control/dispatch, hot-spot detection and risk propensity surface

Police reform and the new public management paradigm 167
identification are currently perceived as the pinnacle of GIS deployment in a
local policing context. Comparatively little geographical expertise is employed in
more strategic tasks such as performance review and the objective evaluation of
crime-reduction or community-safety initiatives. Although proactive, intelligence-led,
evidence-based policy and policing strategy may dominate political rhetoric in the
United Kingdom, GIScience expertise native to the police service predominantly
remains focused on high-profile, reactive policing strategies. Proportionally, relatively
little resource is directed to understanding the composition of local populations, their
concerns, and priorities, and the development of successful engagement strategies
for different types of neighbourhood (Ashby, 2005; Nolan et al, 2004). We would
therefore argue that, just because GIS is currently used in simple hot-spot analysis,
a smooth and untroubled transition to strategic deployment cannot be assumed.
The National Reassurance Policing Programme (NRPP) and signal-crimes perspec-
tive indicates an interesting developmental pathway (Innes et al, 2004). After fifteen
years of `regime drift'öwhere performance indicators had dominated and efficiency
had become more influential than public satisfaction and confidence (Ashby, 2005)öa
return to community policing styles and engagement with local communities is postu-
lated as a means of tackling declining public confidence and satisfaction with policing
in a period of falling crime rates. However, the reassurance-policing paradigm requires
geospatial expertise, technology, and capacity, and as yet the project plans contain few
prescriptive requirements for spatial analysis. For example, fundamental geocoding
procedures remain a topic for research and development (see, for example, Ratcliffe,
2004) and current practices are undeniably variable across Basic Command Units of
contemporary police forces. Similarly, the lack of IT commonality further hampers
common training standards, and historically the important role of the intelligence
officer has not attracted the most appropriate candidates (Ratcliffe, 2002a). Further-
more, Radcliffe's arguments sustain the view that the police service has failed to
transplant business practice effectively and to diffuse technical innovation at a rate
comparable with that in the private sector:
``In many police services, new technologies take a long time to implement, and
by the time they are in place a brief tour of the policing and commercial sites
on the Internet show that they have been invariably superseded by something better
somewhere else'' (Ratcliffe, 2002b, page 56).
Geodemographics: an example of geospatial technology diffusion in the police
Within the domain of spatial analysis, geodemographics (the classification of small
areas into similar neighbourhood types) has been widely used within the private sector
for decades and has become pivotal to tactical and strategic resource management.
However, despite its origins in deprivation studies (Webber, 1975; 2004), adaptation to
public service delivery applications has only recently been mooted (see Ashby, 2005;
Ashby and Longley, 2005; Bowers and Hirschfield, 1999; Brown et al, 2000). The most
recent Police Reform White Paper cites Avon and Somerset Constabulary's use of
``market analysis tools to reduce crime'' (Home Office, 2004a, page 56), and the use
of the proprietary ACORN geodemographic classification as a component in allocat-
ing some top-up allowances in police resourcing (Home Office, 2004b). Rudimentary
geodemographic analyses have been published in Home Office Statistics Bulletins (for
example, Aust and Condon, 2003), with yet more limited analyses regularly summar-
ised in a generalised context (Dodd et al, 2004; Simmons, 2002; Simmons and Dodd,
2003). Nevertheless, geodemographics applications in UK policing remain surprisingly
scarce and limited given the political rhetoric surrounding a `customer-service culture'
for policing and the drive to adopt best business practice.
168 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley
Our own research in Devon and Cornwall Constabulary has pioneered geodemo-
graphic analysis of recorded-crime databases and national surveys as a strategic tool
for local resource allocation, effective community engagement, and strategic delinea-
tion of priority areas. The adoption of such technologies has been championed by
forward-looking local managers, keen to grasp the potential value both of locally
administered and of centrally available datasets. Leveraging extra information from
such databases has been common practice in commercial marketing operations for
many years, but the benefits in the public sector remain largely unrealised (for dis-
cussion of preliminary findings and strategic opportunities see Ashby, 2005; Ashby
and Longley, 2005). Until recently, the public sector culture purposefully ignored
segmentation of the communities it served. The adoption of geodemographics for the
customisation of local public service delivery potentially offers benefits far exceeding
those observed in the commercial world. In commercial practice, geodemographic
analysis is usually used to target appropriate markets with specific private goods.
The benefits therefore accrue to particular segments of the population through free-
market mechanisms. Public goods such as policing are, by their nature, inclusive, and
a challenge is to ensure that benefits accrue across the entire population.
A pragmatic approach to enable the leverage of extra information from adminis-
trative datasets, with a view to informing intelligence-led neighbourhood policing
styles, has been described elsewhere (Ashby, 2005; Ashby and Longley, 2005). Further,
it has been commented that such data-driven approaches and heuristic models of
appropriate policing styles for different localities are consistent with theoretical models
of neighbourhood development: for example, the concepts of collective efficacy (7) and
the notion of social capital (see Ashby, 2005; Williamson et al, 2005). Although further
discussion of these methodologies and results is inappropriate here, the fundamental
underpinnings should be clarified. Using statistical clustering algorithms it is possible
to cluster every neighbourhood (in our case, unit postcodes which on average consti-
tute fifteen households) into a distinct category based upon a range of social-economic,
geographic, demographic, financial, property, consumption, and lifestyle traits. In
practice, such classifications are regularly developed by leading commercial vendors
(for example, Experian(8) or CACI(9)), academics, and/or governmental organisations
for a range of purposes and spatial scales (for discussion of such typologies, see Sleight,
2004). The number of categories within such typologies ranges from thirty to sixty-five
neighbourhood types, with aggregated groups (typically eight to fifteen in number) also
frequently utilised. National classification of very small areas (postcodes), based on
socioeconomic and demographic composition rather than upon geographic location
alone, enable the comparison of similar areas in different regions of the country.
The classification of areas based upon underlying data rather than crude groupings
of administrative areas such as Police Force areas, Basic Command Units, or local
authority districts is consistent with the remit of the Public Service Reform Agenda
regarding devolution and delegation to the lowest appropriate scale to meet the needs
of local communities. As such, the analysis of administrative datasets and national
government surveys would enable: comparative performance assessment and bench-
marking of similar areas with similar policing environments; the dissemination of
(7) ``Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control
of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after con-
trolling for neighbourhood structural characteristics'' (Sampson and Raudenbush, 1999, page 603).
Developments of this concept and discussion of the progression of neighbourhoods in a policing
context are given in Nolan et al (2004).

`what works' to other regions in similar circumstances; and the effective targeting
of resources and communications strategies based upon a detailed understanding of
the likely activity patterns, attitudes, expectations, and concerns of local communities.
Although the potential value of such geodemographic analysis is recognised by
local managers when they are exposed to such techniques, the adoption of these new
technologies and methodologies within the police service has yet to be firmly estab-
lished within the crime analyst's toolbox. A summary of relevant findings from our
own experience with a wide range of police forces, partner organisations, and central
government departments are outlined below. This list also highlights some of the key
observed barriers to the diffusion of new technologies in the police service:
(1) Tendered contracts for IT management and the provision of GIS software can
hinder the swift adoption of desktop spatial analytical packages.
(2) User requirements are too frequently written by semidetached IT specialists, who
tend to impose their view of what end users require.
(3) Data-protection safeguards and restrictions, often assumed and untested, can
adversely affect the flexibility that analysts may require to explore datasets and to
augment ancillary data sources for strategic analyses.
(4) Information-sharing infrastructures remain poorly developed and local managers
have frequently expressed the need for further guidance and clarity regarding legislative
duties and responsibilities, statutory requirements, liabilities and legal vires to enable
more efficient and effective partnership work. Police managers often do not appreciate
the sophisticated flexibilities available within the data-protection legislation.
(5) Appropriate and relevant training for crime analysts is an essential prerequisite to
the diffusion of any new technologies or techniques. The capability of trainee analysts
is often appropriate only for current technology. Therefore innovation may be resisted
or rejected in order to preserve individuals' capabilities.
(6) The research industry that has grown up around GIS development tends to favour
the generation of `training' as opposed to supporting technological innovation that
would ultimately reduce or eliminate the current market value of available training
materials.
(7) Managers trained largely on legal notions of evidence find it difficult to cope with
soft probabilistic information in their decision making.
(8) Police managers have not yet acquired the military trick of leading and directing
levels of technical expertise that they do not share.
Some strategic recommendations
The authors' experience in disseminating and implementing new technologies and
analytical methods into the police service at a local level has encompassed myriad
resistances, and although many obstacles have been overcome, many challenges remain.
Whereas the value and potential of more sophisticated spatial analyses of policing
environments is widely appreciated, the capacity to negotiate a range of obstacles
successfully needs fostering. A working group of police forces, partnership organisa-
tions, academics, and commercial sponsors is assisting us in the dissemination of
geodemographic analysis `best practice' and in the formulation of key standards
and principles to enable effective comparisons and dialogues between apparently
otherwise disparate partners. We suggest that the development of such partnerships
across administrative boundaries, functional specialisms, and divisions within the
public sector would enable efficient, appropriately targeted, service delivery founded
upon evidence-based policy and best practice. Although the absence of competition
across public service regions and departments should enable much more effective
pooling of resources, intelligence, technology, and expertise than is currently observed,
170 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley
or indeed could be practised in commercial environments, it remains the case that
competitors in the commercial world remain far more advanced in the sharing of key
data and the development of standards, protocols, and infrastructures. This paradox
needs to be addressed. It may be, as Lord Browne (cited by Sylvester, 2005) recently
observed, that the public sector needs to appreciate its distinctive characteristics better.
Public services may compete for public money, but that should not act to the
detriment of their public clients. Geodemographic analysis of public service require-
ments has the capacity to demonstrate ways in which different public service delivery
units can act synergistically. For example, by representing the policing concerns of a
community in a geodemographic framework, the need for interagency partnership
working becomes less rhetorical and more concrete: planning, architectural, housing,
transport, and educational requirements to aid problem solving are rapidly made
manifest. The danger of splitting each citizen client into a number of discrete service
components to be treated separately diminishes. The campaign for data sharing is a
dangerous oversimplification: what is required is information sharing, and this presup-
poses a shared conceptual framework, technology, and informatics expertise. Only then
will interagency working become the efficient public service tool of recent political
visions.
However, echoing Ratcliffe's discussion of intelligence-led policing, such prescrip-
tions have to be accompanied by well financed process and outcome evaluation:
``A more pressing problem is the absence of a conceptual framework ... that is
supported by an evidence-based theory. The dearth of any empirical and contextual
research into the effectiveness of intelligence led policing in either the academic or
professional literature leaves the police with little option other than to experiment
and do the best they can'' (Ratcliffe, 2002b, page 64).
Engaging with a wide range of managers, analysts, strategists, and researchers in the
aforementioned working group, the authors have observed that fundamental concepts
and practices can remain straightforward and transparent, and lucid guides to best
practice can be produced. Clear visualisation is highly valued and spatial analyses need
not be limited to specialist GIS products. Professional GIS software is largely unneces-
sary (and prohibitively expensive) for a wide variety of users and, although such
functionality is required by analysts, a full working knowledge of these applications
is unwarranted for a manager simply wanting to create, view, and manipulate a
computer-generated map. Whereas basic mapping tools could become part of a generic
office suite of applications, more advanced analytic tools will remain the domain of
specially trained personnel. However, GIS and geodemographics need not be limited
to highly trained analysts with top-end computers.
In the light of this discussion we recommend the following:
(1) Further clarity and guidance to public service managers and their supporting
analysts about harmonising data-capture, processing, and analytic systems so that
information sharing is rendered not only viable but attractive.
(2) Commitment to open up knowledge-transfer networks beyond their current,
relatively rigid, boundaries allowing academic and commercial influences to dissipate
public sector protectionism.
(3) Reaffirmation of central government's role, not as an arbiter of system design, but
as `referee' capable of ensuring the level of interoperability necessary for open system
knowledge transfer benefits to accrue.
(4) Designing GIS to fit management needs from strategic through tactical to
operational planning and feedback without allowing current low expectations and
low levels of expertise to determine how the technology is developedöempowering
end-users in the design process.
Police reform and the new public management paradigm 171
Concluding remarks
The police service continues to struggle to bridge some of the gaps between what
legislators want and what managers need in terms of performance management.
Although it is understandable that training and research in strategic spatial analysis
within the police force has to compete with the pressing demands of tactical policing
for limited resources, the commitment by central government to provide a customer-
service culture and to deliver local, community-focused, neighbourhood-style policing
suggests the need to explore state-of-the-art solutions from the private sector. In light
of the current commitment to new localism we suggest that, although geodemographics
is never likely to become a panacea for neighbourhood policing (nor should it), the
apparent failure to embrace such ideas, evaluate their potential, and provide a robust
evidence base will perpetuate the gap between the best practice of the public and
private sectors. The available evidence and experience indicates that substantial
and tangible benefits are available.
Crime and disorder are perennially important to voters and, therefore, to politi-
cians. The current political requirement to control taxation and the high cost of
policing society creates a chronic gap between political aspirations and the reality
of operational policy. Performance management and the efficient use of technology
provide reasonable scope for closing this gap. Although GIS must compete with a host
of other management and technology solutions, it uniquely offers an essential compo-
nent of management control: a means of making sense of the police service's arena of
operations. Without it, the National Intelligence Model (NIM) and the new localism
are largely rhetoric.
Private sector managers whose companies depend absolutely on understanding
their markets have already embraced GIS and are adapting it to their special needs.
This process of development has been stunted in the police service, and now needs to
be continuously vitalised to overcome a clutch of evident threats to progress.
Prospectively, the future of geodemographics in the public services is encouraging
and although our argument highlights the time lag between public sector and private
sector practice, the counter argument is legitimate; we support Radcliffe's view (2002a,
page 54) that the apparent ineffectiveness of the traditional policing paradigm is
fuelling enthusiasm for new technology and processes, and that bona fide evaluation
is fundamental. We believe that this enthusiasm paradoxically raises the risk that GIS
will not be properly developed and deployed in policing. For this reason, careful
process and outcome evaluations are essential, not solely, or even mainly, as a civil
service dominated check on ministerial strategy or investment, but as an essential part
of an internal police service led process of innovation management.
