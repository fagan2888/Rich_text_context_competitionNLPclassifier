Phenotypic features associated with the social categorization
of racial groups have been strongly linked to stereotyping,
prejudice, and discrimination. Notably, individuals perceived
to possess higher levels of Afrocentric features (e.g., dark
skin, full lips, wide nose, coarse hair) have been subject to
increased negative stereotyping (e.g., alleging heightened
levels of aggression; see Blair, Chapleau, & Judd, 2005),
leading to real-world repercussions, such as receiving longer
prison sentences for crimes equated for severity and priors
(Blair, Judd, & Chapleau, 2004; Viglione, Hannon, &
DeFina, 2011).
Skin tone has emerged as the most allegedly diagnostic
feature in racial judgments (and is thus perhaps the most
infamous phenotypic feature; for example, Secord, Bevan, &
Katz, 1956; also see Stepanova & Strube, 2009), as exempli-
fied by a skin tone bias (Maddox, 2004; Maddox & Gray,
2002)--the tendency to judge a target's membership in racial
categories/subcategories and to form behavioral intentions
toward the target (see Cesario, Plaks, Hagiwara, Navarrete,
& Higgins, 2010) based on his or her skin tone lightness or
darkness (also see Blair, Judd, Sadler, & Jenkins, 2002;
Maddox & Gray, 2002; Marks, 1943; Sciara, 1983). One of
the evocative characteristics of a skin tone bias is that it is
pervasive across and within diverse ethnic and racial groups,
including Whites, Latinos, and Blacks (see Maddox, 2004).
The link between skin tone and stereotyping has been
demonstrated in a mostly unidirectional fashion, namely
from the perception of a target's complexion to observers'
negative stereotyping of the target (but see Eberhardt, Goff,
Purdie, & Davies, 2004, for bidirectional links between
Black stereotypic crime-related concepts and the activation
of the racial category Black). In the current article, we focus
on the link between the presence of stereotype-related infor-
mation for a target and observers' recognition memory for
the target's skin tone. We ask whether encountering a Black
person following a counter-stereotypic (expectancy-violat-
ing) versus a stereotypic (expectancy-congruent) prime
would lead to misremembering this person's skin tone. The
idea that counter-stereotypic and stereotypic expectancies
could affect perception and memory for skin tone, in a top-
down fashion (for other racial markers in an ambiguous face
paradigm, see MacLin & Malpass, 2001, 2003) is predicated
on a seminal paper by Levin and Banaji (2006) who showed
that Black/White ambiguous faces categorized as White (vs.
Black) were perceived as being lighter in reflectance,
lending support to the idea that social categorization affects

When an "Educated" Black Man Becomes
Lighter in the Mind's Eye: Evidence for a
Skin Tone Memory Bias

Abstract
We offer novel evidence that a Black man appears lighter in the mind's eye following a counter-stereotypic prime, a
phenomenon we refer to as skin tone memory bias. In Experiment 1, participants were primed subliminally with the counter-
stereotypic word educated or with the stereotypic word ignorant, followed by the target stimulus of a Black man's face. A
recognition memory task for the target's face and six lures (skin tone variations of ±25%, ±37%, and ±50%) revealed that
participants primed with "educated" exhibited more memory errors with respect to lighter lures--misidentifying even the
lightest lure as the target more often than counterparts primed with "ignorant." This skin tone memory bias was replicated
in Experiment 2. We situate these findings in theorizing on the mind's striving for cognitive consistency. Black individuals who
defy social stereotypes might not challenge social norms sufficiently but rather may be remembered as lighter, perpetuating
status quo beliefs.

skin tone perception in the direction of a racial stereotype.
Levin and Banaji invited "more research exploring how this
most basic of percepts is modulated by a broad range of
knowledge" (p. 511). We chose to follow Levin and Banaji's
exhortation by exploring the possible effects of a stereotype
expectancy violation on recognition memory for skin tone,
using a Black male target face (an unambiguous-race face).
The rationale for using a paradigm that is centered on an
unambiguous-race face, instead of the oft-used ambiguous-
race face paradigm, is that for the former (but not for the
latter) there exist clear stereotypic and counter-stereotypic
expectancies.
Our experimental paradigm employed forward and back-
ward masking procedures following Pessiglione et al. (2008).
Participants were primed subliminally with a Black counter-
stereotypic word (educated; expectancy-violating) or with a
Black stereotypic word (ignorant; expectancy-congruent),
which was followed immediately by a photograph of a Black
man's face. Participants were thus unaware of the prime
before completing a speeded recognition memory task for
the target photo and six lures (25%, 37%, and 50% lighter
and darker in skin tone).
We contend that encountering the counter-stereotypic
word educated (for education as connoting White vs. Black,
see Fiske, 2005; Gaertner & McLaughlin, 1983; Wittenbrink,
Judd, & Park, 1997) prior to viewing a Black person's face
would likely result in a "Whitening" of the target's face in
memory. This prediction can be situated in recent theorizing
on stereotype disconfirmation and cognitive consistency. In
particular, Sherman, Allen, and Sacchi (2012) argued that a
counter-stereotypic instance tends to create an incompatible
cognition, which is then oftentimes resolved by assimilating
individuating information to the stereotype. Within Sherman
et al.'s (2012) framework, encountering an educated Black
male could lead to reclassification of this individual as an
atypical exemplar or a subtype of his racial category, which
preserves cultural beliefs about racial category structure.
From a cognitive consistency viewpoint (also see
Gawronski, Peters, Brochu, & Strack, 2008), encountering
the word ignorant prior to viewing the Black target's face
should not lead to memory distortions because a stereotypic
prime would be congruent with societal expectations and
therefore would not create an incompatible cognition that
would require dissonance reduction (per Sherman et al.,
2012). There is some evidence, however, that Black stereo-
typic primes cause people to falsely recognize more proto-
typical Black exemplars. Specifically, Eberhardt et al. (2004)
found that (a) Black stereotypic crime-related primes elicited
faster responses and more sustained attention to Black versus
White faces in a dot-probe task (Studies 2 and 3) and (b) after
being presented with crime-related primes, police officers
were more likely to falsely identify a Black lure, which was
more stereotypical than the target (Study 4). Eberhardt et al.
argued that a Black stereotypic prime, such as crime, might
either activate a prototypical Black male or perhaps several
Black male exemplars in memory that "seem most physi-
cally representative of the Black racial category (i.e., those
who look highly stereotypical)" (p. 877; also see Osborne &
Davies, 2013, for evidence that Black stereotypic crimes
cause an increased misattribution of Afrocentric features to
perpetrators). Despite the fact that Eberhardt et al. did not
examine the effects of stereotype-driven expectancies on
memory distortions for a given Black male face--they exam-
ined instead whether a Black target face would be confused
with a different and more stereotypical Black male lure in a
police lineup--their findings raise the possibility that
encountering a stereotypic word (e.g., ignorant) prior to
viewing a Black target face would result in a more stereo-
typic representation of that face's features in memory, includ-
ing a darker skin tone. Such a finding would beckon revising
the current theorizing, which is based on a dissonance-reduc-
tion cognitive consistency framework, to include a prototype
activation mechanism for stereotypic primes.
Stereotypes provide important cognitive functions such as
organization and prediction (Hamilton & Sherman, 1994),
ego protection (e.g., Fein & Spencer, 1997), and preparation
for action in the social world (see Morsella & Ben-Zeev,
2012). Given that a skin tone memory bias would function in
the service of stereotype maintenance, even partial evidence
for its existence--a Black male becoming lighter or darker in
the mind's eye, following a counter-stereotypic or a stereo-
typic prime, respectively--would have grave implications.
In other words, it is possible that a stereotype could become
a prepotent response for organizing incoming visual infor-
mation, resulting in a heightened "perceptual readiness"
(Bruner, 1957) for distorting a person's skin tone in the direc-
tion of that stereotype (a "visual tuning device" per Eberhardt
et al., 2004). A skin tone memory bias might persevere even
in the face of counter-stereotypic exemplars that might have
otherwise served to defy stereotype-based expectancies,
resulting in a "catch-22" between an allegedly diagnostic
racial feature and social beliefs.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was designed to examine whether participants
would evince a skin tone memory bias as a function of coun-
ter-stereotypic versus stereotypic subliminal primes, using
forward and backward masking procedures based on
Pessiglione et al. (2008). The use of subliminal priming
affords exploring the effects of counter-stereotypic/stereo-
typic primes while overcoming social desirability factors
that would likely be elicited with an explicit presentation of
the same primes. A prime appeared for 33 ms, flanked tem-
porally by pre- and post-masks for 67 ms each. The presenta-
tion of the prime was designed to occur below the threshold
of conscious awareness and the sequence appeared to be a
static supraliminal image of the pattern mask (see Figure 1b).
The subliminal primes were presented in black font using
40-point Helvetica and displayed centrally on a 50.8 cm
Ben-Zeev et al. 3
Apple iMac monitor with a viewing distance of approxi-
mately 48 cm. The priming procedures were pilot-tested with
respect to stimulus durations (N= 17) to ensure that the prime
was below the threshold of conscious awareness (no pilot
participants reported seeing the prime at 33 ms). Primes
(educated, ignorant, and athletic) were selected from the
literature (Wittenbrink et al., 1997) and were pilot-tested
(N = 36) with regard to stereotypicality. We purposely
selected the words educated and ignorant given prevalent
stereotypes alleging intellectual inferiority of Blacks versus
Whites (Steele, 1997), but included the positively valenced
word athletic to control for the possibility of an inadvertent
valence effect (rather than the predicted counter-stereotypic
vs. stereotypic effect) between the semantically opposite
educated and ignorant primes. The prime was followed
immediately by a presentation of the target photograph (see
Figure 1a). On a subsequent recognition memory task, par-
ticipants were presented with the Black male target1 and six
variations of the target (lighter and darker in skin tone),
which served as lures.
In accordance with a cognitive consistency framework,
the educated (counter-stereotypic or expectancy-violating)
prime, as compared with the ignorant and athletic (stereo-
typic or expectancy-congruent) primes, was expected to lead
to heightened memory errors (i.e., the proportion of incorrect
identifications of lures as the target) for lighter lures only,
suggesting that the target's skin tone would be remembered
as relatively lighter. The expected effects for the darker lures
were less clear. A dissonance-reduction mechanism per cog-
nitive consistency theorizing (Sherman et al., 2012) would
suggest that there would be no effect of prime on the darker
lures. However, Eberhardt et al.'s (2004) Study 4 findings
offer the possibility of heightened memory errors for darker
lures as well, such that the target's skin tone would be
remembered as relatively darker following a stereotypic
prime; perhaps resulting from the activation of a Black male
prototype.
Method
Participants. Participants were 125 undergraduate students at
San Francisco State University2 who participated in exchange
for partial course credit. All participants had normal or cor-
rected-to-normal vision.
Materials. The stimuli consisted of seven color photographs: A
target Black male and six variations of the target (±25%, ±37%,
and ±50%), which served as lures.3 All photographs had 206 ×
255 pixel off-white (128-128-128 rgb) backgrounds.
Procedure.Participants were recruited to participate in a
"study on memory for faces" and randomly assigned to
between-subjects subliminal prime conditions: counter-ste-
reotypic (educated) and two stereotypic conditions (ignorant
and athletic). To ensure that participants attended to the
subliminal prime, participants were instructed to focus their
attention on the center of the computer screen. Following the
presentation of the subliminal prime, participants were given
30 s to study the target photo for later recognition. Partici-
pants subsequently completed 16 trials of a working memory
distractor task (a modified n-back task), in which they viewed
random digits (from 0 to 9) presented sequentially and were
prompted at random intervals to input the last three digits.
Participants then completed the recognition task. Stimulus
presentation was controlled using PsyScope Experiment
Software (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993).
The recognition task consisted of 28 trials in which the
target and lures were presented 4 times each in random order.
Participants were asked to indicate Yes/No to the question
"Is this face IDENTICAL to the one you studied originally?"
For each experimental trial, participants viewed a central
fixation point (+) for 500 ms, followed by the stimulus
(a target or lure) for 255 ms, which was succeeded by a ques-
tion mark that remained on the screen until participants indi-
cated a response (by pressing either the "f" or "j" key;
counterbalanced across participants). The fixation point was
then replaced by an equal sign (=). After 1,000 ms, the next
experimental trial initiated (see Figure 1c). Finally, partici-
pants completed a funneled debriefing (Bargh & Chartrand,
2000). None of the participants reported seeing the prime.
Results and Discussion
Accuracy to the original target (M = .734, SE = .024) indi-
cated that participants were able to consistently recognize the
target, on average three out of four target presentations.
Effects of prime type on memory errors to the lightest and dark-
est lures. A trend analysis of the lighter lures showed that as
the images increased in dissimilarity (+25%, +37%, +50%)
to the target (0%), participants' accuracy increased linearly
across prime condition, F(1, 122) = 109.786, p < .001, p
2
=
.474. A similar pattern was uncovered for the darker lures;
participants' accuracy increased linearly as the images
became darker, F(1, 122) = 76.274, p < .001, p
2
= .385.
Examining whether the primes would influence memory
errors to the extreme light lure (+50%) and extreme dark lure
(-50%) would thus constitute a conservative test for the exis-
tence of a skin tone memory bias.
AmixedANOVAwith all three primes (ignorant, educated,
athletic) revealed a marginal interaction between lure and
prime, F(2, 122) = 2.959, p = .056, p
2
= .046. As predicted,
pairwise comparisons of the prime conditions revealed that
ignorant and athletic did not differ, p = .358, indicating that the
valence of the stereotypic prime was not a factor. We therefore
tested the semantically opposite ignorant (stereotypic) and
educated (counter-stereotypic) primes: A mixed ANOVA on
the lightest versus darkest lure by prime type (ignorant vs.
educated) revealed a significant interaction between lure and
prime, F(1, 86) = 5.175, p = .025, p
2
= .057.

To further investigate the effect of prime on memory
errors to the lightest versus darkest lure, we tested the simple
effects of prime type for each lure. As predicted from a cog-
nitive consistency perspective, (a) an ANOVA on memory
errors to the darkest lure (-50%) did not reveal an effect of
prime, F(2, 122) = 0.791, p = .456, p
2
= .013; but (b) for the
lightest lure (+50%), participants in the counter-stereotypic/
educated condition evinced increased memory errors
(M = .388, SE = .048) as compared with counterparts in both
stereotypic conditions (ignorant: M = .212, SE = .042, and
athletic: M = .203, SE = .049), F(2, 122) = 5.305, p = .006,
p
2
= .080 (see Figure 2a). A planned contrast for the lightest
lure revealed that participants primed with educated exhib-
ited significantly more memory errors (M = .388, SE = .048)
than participants in the stereotypic conditions, on average
(M = .207, SE = .032), t(122) = 3.257, p = .001. To examine
whether this finding held for the lightest but not the darkest
lure, we conducted similar analyses on the darkest lure,
which, were not significant (all ps > .10).
Memory errors for lighter versus darker lures. Composite error
scores for the darker (-50%, -37%, -25%) and lighter
(+25%, +37%, +50%) lures, respectively, were created to
test whether the findings for the extreme light and dark lure
held for all the darker and lighter lures. An ANOVA on
memory errors for darker lures (-50%, -37%, -25%) did
not reveal an effect of prime, F(2, 122) = 0.136, p = .873,
p
2
= .002. We therefore focused on memory errors for lighter
lures (+25%, +37%, +50%) only, consistent with previous
analyses which were conducted on the extreme light and dark
lures. For the lighter lures, participants in the counter-stereo-
typic/educated condition evinced increased memory errors
(M = .522, SE = .039) as compared with counterparts in both
stereotypic conditions (ignorant: M = .419, SE = .039, and
athletic: M = .360, SE = .047), F(2, 122) = 4.049, p = .02,
p
2
= .062 (see Figure 2b).
Following the analyses for the lightest and darkest lures,
we compared memory errors for participants in the educated
condition against average memory errors for participants in
both stereotypic conditions (ignorant and athletic did not dif-
fer, t(74) = .968, p = .336). This planned contrast revealed
that participants in the educated condition exhibited signifi-
cantly more memory errors (M = .522, SE = .039) in response
to the lighter lures as compared with participants in the ste-
reotypic conditions (M = .390, SE = .030), t(122) = 2.698,
p = .008.

Taken together, data from Experiment 1 yielded evidence
supporting the existence of a skin tone memory bias per a
cognitive consistency but not a prototype activation frame-
work, such that the same Black man was remembered as
lighter in complexion, if contextualized as educated (vs. as
ignorant or as athletic). We examine this phenomenon further
in Experiment 2.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we added two additional stimuli as distrac-
tors (i.e., fox and greeble targets and their respective lures)
and framed this study as one that was intended to measure
"color perception and visual acuity" to (a) explore whether
the skin tone memory bias found in Experiment 1 would rep-
licate and (b) attempt to rule out the possibility that the find-
ings might have been due to the word educated itself, which
perhaps has a unique association with lightness that is not
specific to race-based social categorization (e.g., educated as
connoting light, as illustrated by the word enlightened). We
decided a priori to include only the semantically opposite
primes of educated versus ignorant, which have been shown
to be associated with education-related stereotypes about
Black individuals (e.g., Fiske, 2005; Gaertner & McLaughlin,
1983; Wittenbrink et al., 1997). The athletic prime, which
was used in Experiment 1 to rule out a valence effect, was
not included because it was shown to not differ from the
ignorant prime. If the skin tone memory bias found in
Experiment 1 would replicate in human but not in other cat-
egories, we would expect that the Black male but not the
non-human targets would be subject to heightened memory
errors following the counter-stereotypic prime (educated) as
compared with its semantically opposite stereotypic prime
(ignorant).
Method
Participants.
Thirty-five San Francisco State University
undergraduate students participated in exchange for partial
course credit. All participants had normal or corrected-to-
normal vision.
Materials. All materials were the same as those used in Exper-
iment 1 with the exception of two additional targets (fox and
greeble) and their respective lures (see Figure 3a). We selected
a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a biological kind stimulus (e.g.,
Medin & Ortony, 1989) and a greeble as a computer-gener-
ated stimulus documented to activate face-processing regions
similarly to human faces (e.g., Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson,
Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999). The original photograph of the
Black male, fox, and greeble served as targets, with six varia-
tions per target (±25%, ±37%, and ±50%) as lures. Thus, each
participant viewed a total of 21 different images.
Procedure.All procedures were identical to those used in
Experiment 1 with the following exceptions. Participants in
Experiment 2 were randomly assigned to one of two between-
subjects prime conditions: counter-stereotypic (educated) or
stereotypic (ignorant). The study time for the original images
following the prime was increased from 30 s to 60 s because
participants were being asked to simultaneously study three
target stimuli instead of one. The recognition task consisted
of 84 trials in which each of the 21 pictures was randomly
presented four times.
Results and Discussion
Accuracy to the Black male target was similar to that of
Experiment 1 (M = .77, SE = .054) and not significantly dif-

ferent from accuracy to the fox (M = .71, SE = .052) or gree-
ble (M = .69, SE = .045), F(2, 68) = 1.653, p = .20.
Effects of prime type on memory errors to the lightest and dark-
est lures. Similarly to Experiment 1, trend analyses showed
that as the images increased in dissimilarity (±25%, ±37%,
±50%) to the target (0%), participants' accuracy increased
linearly across prime condition for both the lighter, F(1, 33)
= 20.577, p < .001, p
2
= .384, as well as the darker lures,
F(1, 33) = 49.479, p < .001, p
2
= .60. Following the same
rationale as in Experiment 1, we examined whether the
primes would influence memory errors to the extreme light
(+50%) and extreme dark (-50%) lures. A mixed ANOVA on
the lightest versus darkest lure by prime type (ignorant vs.
educated) revealed a significant interaction between lure and
prime, F(1, 33) = 8.825, p = .006, p
2
= .211.
As in Experiment 1, we examined whether the lightest
Black male lure (+50%) would by itself still elicit differential
memory errors as a function of prime to conservatively test
for a skin tone memory bias. A one-way ANOVA on memory
errors as a function of prime condition was significant,
F(1, 33) = 5.536, p = .025, p
2
= .144, such that participants
primed with educated exhibited significantly more memory
errors (M = .403, SE = .063) to the lightest lure than partici-
pants primed with ignorant (M = .191, SE = .064). Analyses
on the darkest lure were not significant (all ps > .10; see
Figure 3b).
Memory errors for lighter versus darker Black male lures.Simi-
larly to Experiment 1 and as predicted from a cognitive con-
sistency perspective, anANOVAon memory errors for darker
Black male lures (-50%, -37%, -25%) did not reveal an
effect of prime, F(1, 33) = 0.032, p = .860, p
2
= .001. Thus,
we focused on memory errors for lighter lures (+25%, +37%,
+50%) only. For these lures, participants in the counter-ste-
reotypic educated condition evinced increased memory errors
(M = .602, SE = .052) as compared with counterparts in the
stereotypic ignorant condition (M = .319, SE = .045), F(1, 33)
= 16.867, p < .001, p
2
= .338 (see Figure 3c).
Educated does not equal "lightness":The case of foxes and gree-
bles.We conducted analogous ANOVAs on memory errors
for the lighter fox and greeble stimuli and found no effects of
prime for either the lighter fox images, F(1, 33) = 0.928, p =
.324, p
2
= .027, or for the lighter greeble images, F(1, 33) <
0.001, p = .990, p
2
< .001. As expected, analyses on the
darker images were also non-significant. Thus, the skin tone
memory bias was replicated for the Black male target only,
likely due to what the word educated connotes, culturally, in
relation to race.

Experiment 2 data thus corroborate the findings from
Experiment 1 and provide further support for the hypothesis
that a skin tone memory bias exists and is specific to racial
categorization, such that--in line with cognitive consistency
theorizing--a counter-stereotypical Black male is remem-
bered as lighter in complexion.
General Discussion
Taken together, the present data provide evidence that a
counter-stereotypic Black male tends to be remembered as
"Whiter" in accordance with cultural beliefs and thus offer
support for the existence of a skin tone memory bias. We use
Whiter versus White, because a "one-drop" rule has been
documented to guide automatic judgments of racial category
membership, such that a Black­White biracial individual
tends to be perceived as Black (Peery & Bodenhausen, 2008;
also see Halberstadt, Sherman, & Sherman, 2011, for a cate-
gorization-based account of hypodescent). These findings--
a counter-stereotypic (expectancy-violating) but not a
stereotypic (expectancy-congruent) effect--are consistent
with the mind's striving for cognitive consistency or the ten-
dency to attempt to resolve an incompatible cognition in the
direction of a stereotype (Sherman et al., 2012). Whereas
encountering a Black individual after being primed with the
word educated might pose a challenge to existing beliefs,
encountering a Black individual after being primed with the
word ignorant would likely not require resolution or a misre-
membering of skin tone to align with these beliefs; especially
in light of work on hypodescent (Halberstadt et al., 2011;
Peery & Bodenhausen, 2008).
A caveat is in order, however. It is possible that our cur-
rent stimuli and paradigm were not sensitive enough to
uncover a stereotypic-driven expectancy-congruent skin
tone memory bias. Education-related primes might have dif-
ferential effects on memory distortions of Black targets than
do crime-related primes, such as those used by Eberhardt
et al. (2004). A Black target primed as a criminal (vs. as
being uneducated) might be perceived as more threatening,
perhaps causing an activation of a Black male prototype (see
Eberhardt et al., 2004, for how some concepts might be more
central to the activation of a group prototype), and any ensu-
ing effects on memory for skin tone. In addition, the present
experiments required participants to study a single Black
male face while being informed that they would later be
given a recognition test for this target face, whereas Eberhardt
et al. (Study 4) used five Black faces (the target and four
lures: two that were less stereotypic than the target and two
that were more stereotypic than the target) and used an inci-
dental memory paradigm. Eberhardt et al. argued that prim-
ing police officers with crime "led them to envision a Black
face that was even more strongly representative of the Black
racial category than the Black face to which they were actu-
ally exposed" (p. 888). It is thus possible that a stereotypic-
driven skin tone memory bias could occur under certain
conditions, such as in the process of selecting a target face
from a set of different Black males who vary systematically
with regard to stereotypicality (as in Eberhardt et al.'s
lineup). We thus advocate for further research on the nuanced
nature of a skin tone memory bias and its underlying mecha-
nisms, which should use a variety of primes, stimuli, and
paradigms, as well as measure people's experience of disso-
nance directly.
Uncovering a skin tone memory bias, in which an edu-
cated Black man becomes lighter in the mind's eye, is worth-
while in its own right given the documented detrimental
effects of a skin tone bias held by White perceivers as well as
by people of color (Maddox, 2004). Of equal import, a skin
tone memory bias fits within a broader tradition of what is
now considered to be classical work on the effects of social
context on perception and memory (Bruner, 1957; Bruner &
Goodman, 1947; Sherif, 1935; Tajfel & Wilkes, 1963) and its
recent re-incarnation (a revitalized "new look" perspective,
see Corneille, Hugenberg, & Potter, 2007, p. 348), a body of
work on how social categorization-based predictions bias
perception and memory of socially diagnostic stimuli,
including physical features, objects, and expressions of affect
(also see Becker, Neel, & Anderson, 2010; Corneille, Huart,
Becquart, & Brédart, 2004; Eberhardt et al., 2004; Hugenberg
& Bodenhausen, 2004; Levin & Banaji, 2006; MacLin &
Malpass, 2003).
In sum, a skin tone memory bias reinforces the bidirec-
tional interplay between social contextual cues and memory
for an allegedly diagnostic racial feature, which conspires to
affect judgments about and actions toward stigmatized indi-
viduals--especially intellectually successful Black individu-
als who are susceptible to being perceived as "an exception
to their race" (e.g., Fowler, 2001)--in the direction of pre-
serving existing beliefs.

Notes
1. The target was pilot-tested (n = 76) with respect to perceived
race.
2. Maddox and colleagues (e.g., Maddox & Gray, 2002) have
provided evidence that skin tone bias is prevalent across differ-
ent ethnic and racial populations. Our sample was multi-ethnic
and multi-racial: 36.3% White, 21.7% Asian/Pacific Islander,
8 SAGE Open
20.4% Latino, 8.9% Black, and 12.7% Other. There were no
significant (or near significant) differences in memory errors
between non-White and White participants.
3. To create each variation, a single pixel (serving as a reference)
was isolated from the target, and its rgb values were recorded.
From there, the skin area of the target was adjusted accord-
ingly (lighter or darker), until the rgb values of the reference
matched the new, correct values.

Author Biographies
Avi Ben-Zeev is a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at San
Francisco State University (SFSU), where he directs the Complex
Cognition Lab and is the Co-Coordinator of the Mind, Brain &
Behavior Program. He received his PhD degree from Yale
University in 1997. Dr. Ben-Zeev's scholarship has centered on
explicating cognitive underpinnings of social categorization and
stereotyping, especially in regard to identifying contextual factors
that cause stigmatized individuals to underperform intellectually
(i.e., social identity threat). More recently, Dr. Ben-Zeev has been
investigating how memory and perception conspire to distort
socially diagnostic racial and gender features in the service of cog-
nitive consistency.
Tara C. Dennehy is a doctoral student at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst. She received her MA from San Francisco
State University in 2011. Tara's research interests are broadly
located at the intersection of cognitive and social psychology with a
focus on examining basic processes and their implications for ste-
reotyping, prejudice, and social inequity.
Robin I. Goodrich is a doctoral student at the University of
California, Davis. She received her BA from San Francisco State
University in 2011. Robin's research focuses on the extent to which
dissociable working memory processes rely on the hippocampus
and surrounding medial temporal lobe.
Branden S. Kolarik is a doctoral student at the University of
California, Davis. He received his MA from San Francisco State
University in 2011. His research focuses on human episodic mem-
ory; more specifically on the neural mechanisms that support long-
term memory for spatial context.
Mark W. Geisler is a Professor of Physiological Psychology at
San Francisco State University (SFSU), where he directs the
Cognitive Psychophysiology Lab and is the Co-Coordinator of
the Mind, Brain & Behavior Program. He received his PhD degree
from SUNY, Stony Brook in 1994. Dr. Geisler's scholarship has
centered on human psychophysiology, specifically using electro-
encephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in
research and applied clinical settings in order to quantify and char-
acterize human information processing, and to assess the relation-
ship between neuropsychological and electrophysiological mea-
sures of cognition.
