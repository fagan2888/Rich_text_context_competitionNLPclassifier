Mission Unfulfilled:
Potholes On The Road
To Mental Health Parity
The questforparity should be driven by the desire to provide the
bestcare, notby indiscriminate cuttingof costs and services.

PROLOGUE: The rapid emergence of managed behavioral health
care has transformed the treatment of the mentally ill in many
ways that have been documented. But there are other
dimensions that have been less well explored. In this lead
paper prepared by David Mechanic and Donna McAlpine of
Rutgers University, the most important (and disturbing)
conclusion they reach is that as managed behavioral health care
has grown to dominate treatment of the mentally ill, an
increased democratization of that care has occurred. That is,
individuals, however ill, have tended to receive a similar level
of treatment. This approach obviously places at greater risk
those patients suffering from the most serious forms of mental
illness.

ABSTRACT: Managed care holds the promise of facilitating parity between
general medical care and alcohol, drug, and mental health care by reducing
expenditures, even while expanding benefits. Limitations in our knowledge of
variations in needs and treatment standards for substance use and psychiatric
illnesses make such disorders an easy targetfor management. Costs for behav-
ioral health care services have been reduced ata faster pace than has been the
case for general medical care costs. The most severely ill face the potential
burdens of managed care as access and intensity of care become more uniform
across patient populations.
It i s co mmo nly as s erted tha t the organizational ap-
proaches and strategies of managed behavioral health care (in-
volving capitated payment and utilization management) will al-
low wiser and more efficient use of resources, thereby facilitating
parity with general medical care.1 Such optimism derives from the
large reductions in costs that managed behavioral health care has
achieved for public and private employers. In addition, studies of
particular employer health plans under behavioral health care carve-
outs suggest that parity can be achieved with small additional yearly
premiums if the structures and strategies for management are in
place. The passage of the Mental Health Parity Act in 1996 can be
attributed in part to research evidence showing that management
strategies could contain costs, even while benefits were expanded.
This paper addresses a number of issues that are fundamental to
parity but that have not typically been central to discussions of
managed care's impact on spending. First, we examine national
trends in behavioral health care spending as a proportion of all
health spending. We ask whether there are attributes of mental
health practice that have made it an easier target for cost reduction
than are other areas of health care. Second, because reductions in
costs do not necessarily imply poor care, we make some effort to
look into the "black box" of managed care and inquire whether the
results of care management strategies appear to be rational. The data
are inadequate for answering such questions definitively, but they
provide cautionary guides for future monitoring efforts. Third, we
focus on the clients with the most serious illnesses and greatest
disabilities, and we consider the consequences of managed care for
achieving parity for these groups. We examine evidence that man-
aged care strategies "democratize" the provision of services and thus
reduce the intensity of care for the sickest patients.
We argue that the concept of parity, as typically applied, remains
limited. As ordinarily used, parity refers to maintaining the same
annual and lifetime benefits, coinsurance arrangements, and limits
on hospital days and visits that apply to general medical conditions.
Even this ambitious goal is narrow because it fails to account for the

critical importance of benefit design and for the fact that usual
concepts of medical necessity may exclude vital services needed by
persons with mental health and substance abuse problems, particu-
larly clients with the most serious and persistent conditions. More-
over, the implementation of parity depends on being able to ensure
access to appropriate care of high quality. Management strategies
may enable or inhibit such implementation.
Managed Behavioral Health Care And Spending
A recent study comparing national spending for alcohol, drug, and
mental health (ADM) treatment between 1986 and 1996 reported
that average annual growth of such expenditures was 7.2 percent,
compared with 8.3 percent for overall personal health care.2 Find-
ings from studies of health spending by employers are consistent
with this national trend. The Hay Group estimated that behavioral
health benefits, as a proportion of total employer health care costs,
fell from 6.1 percent in 1988 to 3.1 percent in 1997.3 These figures
should be interpreted cautiously, because we know very little about
the representativeness of this convenience sample. Jeffrey Buck and
Beth Umland, using a convenience-panel survey of large employers
collected by Foster Higgins, similarly report that ADM costs fell
from 9 percent of all health costs in 1989 to approximately 4 percent
in 1995.4 They also report that ADM spending among employers
with 500 or more employees declined from about 6 percent of health
benefit costs in 1993 to 4 percent in 1995.
These studies have limitations, but they plausibly suggest that
spending for behavioral health care is falling behind other areas.
Given the consistent body of research that documents large un-
treated ADM conditions in the general population, clinical studies
that repeatedly document minimal and inadequate treatment, and
the pattern of discrimination against and stigmatization of persons
with ADM problems, behavioral health spending's failure to keep
pace with health spending overall requires continuing scrutiny.5
A case can be made that the slower growth of behavioral health
care spending is a correction of a pattern of indiscriminate growth in
the early 1980s. Saul Feldman, chief executive officer of a behavioral
health care company, reports that by the mid-1980s the proportion
of total health care costs attributable to behavioral health care in
large companies climbed to 15­18 percent or even more but has now
stabilized at below 10 percent.6 He reports that the introduction of
managed care strategies achieved savings of 30­40 percent or more
in the first few years; this is generally consistent with the literature.7
However, many large companies that became clients of behavioral
health care companies were motivated to do so by very high, and

often increasing, behavioral health care costs. In part, these in-
creases were catching up with unmet need, improved treatment,
and reduced stigma associated with seeking such care. But they also
reflected the opportunistic behavior of specialty providers that
could offer services to the level of enriched insurance coverage.
Thus, in the early period of managed care it appeared relatively easy
to bring costs down without doing harm.
Managed care may function very differently, when expenditures
are initially moderate or low, relative to the success stories reported
by companies such as IBM and Xerox that have so often been re-
ported in the literature.8 Given similar levels of overall health spend-
ing, the consequences of reducing behavioral health spending from
15 percent to 10 percent of expenditures are different from reduc-
tions from 10 percent to 5 percent and even to 3 percent, as some
report. Experience also is likely to depend on the total constellation
of strategies for dealing with employee problems, including em-
ployee assistance programs (EAPs). In many of the instances noted
in the literature, significant savings were made by attacking "low-
hanging fruit," such as routine inpatient alcohol and other substance
abuse treatment, long hospital stays for children and adolescents,
and other excesses of cost-based reimbursement. By curtailing inpa-
tient days and bargaining aggressively with providers and facilities,
managed care companies initially have not faced much difficulty in
reducing costs. Forecasts that parity could be achieved because of
the substantial saving possibilities inherent in managing care may
be based, therefore, on evidence that cannot be reliably generalized.
A case also can be made that the reductions in growth of ADM
spending, compared with overall personal health care spending, re-
flected a widening gap between the benefit packages employers
offered for mental and physical health care. There is much evidence
of a growing deficit in benefits for ADM services over the past
decade. Limits in coverage for mental health care have become more
common, and cost sharing has increased more substantially for men-
tal health care than for general medical care.9 This situation was
inadequately addressed by the Mental Health Parity Act.
Health care spending commonly follows new knowledge and
technology, new treatment opportunities, changing patterns of ill-
ness, opportunities created by new reimbursement rules, and the
supply of professionals and facilities. Medications and patient man-

agement strategies in mental health care have improved greatly, but
it would be difficult to argue that these advances are greater than, or
even comparable to, advances in other areas of medicine. There is no
inherent logic in maintaining that ADM spending needs to grow at
the same pace as other spending. But in light of the trends, it does
seem prudent to inquire whether ADM care is being targeted more
than physical health care and, if so, what the consequences are for
those who require the most intensive services. Parity in benefit
structures means little if ADM care is managed more stringently
than other types of health care. We now turn to this issue.
Targeting And The `Black Box' Of Managed Care
ADM services have been an easy target for managed care because
they traditionally have been based in institutions, with longer
lengths of inpatient stay than was the case for most other medical
care. While lengths-of-stay also have been falling for medical and
surgical conditions for several years, ADM inpatient care has had a
longer way to fall.10 The greatest reduction in patient days continues
to be in mental hospitals, where the aggregate number of such days
has fallen markedly over time.11 Even in general hospitals, length-of-
stay among persons with primary psychiatric disorders has fallen
sharply over the past decade. For example, average length-of-stay
among persons with a primary psychiatric diagnosis in private, non-
profit general hospitals--the primary place for acute inpatient
care--fell from 12.6 days in 1988 to 8.6 days in 1995, despite a more
severely ill patient population.12
Individual studies suggest that managed care may be targeting
ADM services more than other types of medical care. Thomas
Wickizer and Daniel Lessler performed a retrospective analysis of
the effects of utilization management on hospital use among almost
50,000 patients between 1989 and 1993.13 Requested admissions
were rarely denied, but concurrent review of length-of-stay caused
hospital days to plummet. Patients with mental illness were most
affected by these utilization review strategies: While they only con-
stituted 5.7 percent of inpatient cases that were reviewed, they ac-
counted for 55 percent of the gap between the total number of days
requested and the number of days approved. Requests for bed days
for patients with psychoses were allowed at no higher a rate (54.6
percent) than were those for all mental health admissions (54 per-
cent). In contrast, approved bed days for obstetrics, medical admis-
sions, and surgical admissions were 93 percent, 86 percent, and 83
percent, respectively. Average length-of-stay (adjusted for sex, age,
and region) fell significantly for all types of admissions but espe-
cially for mental health from 1990 to 1993. The average number of

medical days approved fell from 6.8 days to 5.2 days (­23.5 percent),
but the average number of mental health days approved fell from
20.7 days to 10.9 days (­47.3 percent).
The observation by Wickizer and Lessler that denials did not
vary by the seriousness of the mental health diagnosis suggests that
managed care may reduce care indiscriminately. Full understanding
of how managed care works, however, requires knowledge of the
epidemiology of need in each population, the utilization levels that
predate the managed care carve-out, the structure of the managed
care contract, and the degree of local competition among mental
health facilities and providers. Such information is almost never
available, so we have to make inferences from ambiguous data.
Case studies of large employment groups and state employees'
programs indicate that managed care carve-outs do achieve substan-
tial savings per enrollee. However, the data suggest various explana-
tions for the savings. For example, Ching-to Ma and Thomas
McGuire, in a study of a carve-out for Massachusetts state employ-
ees, found a 10 percent increase in mental health inpatient admis-
sions and only a slight reduction (5 percent) in length-of-stay but a
very large drop (70 percent) in price per day (from $1,257 to $384).14
The decline in costs for inpatient substance abuse care was similar,
except that admissions decreased by 5 percent and length-of-stay
increased slightly. In contrast, William Goldman and colleagues, in
a study of a large West Coast employer, reported a 24 percent reduc-
tion in inpatient admissions and a 43 percent reduction in length-of-
stay.15 Roland Sturm and colleagues, examining the implementation
of a managed care parity benefit among Ohio state employees, re-
ported a reduction of more than 75 percent in inpatient days.16
If managed care strategies are functioning properly, we anticipate
that large reductions in inpatient care should be accompanied by
sizable increases in alternative services that can reasonably substi-
tute. We observe this pattern in some studies. Goldman and col-
leagues reported substantial increases in claims paid for outpatient
treatment, and more modest increases in claims paid for residential
and day treatment, during the years following implementation of a
carve-out when inpatient claims were declining.17
In other instances, however, we see no significant substitution,
suggesting that the motivation is more to manage costs than to
manage care. Ma and McGuire, for example, found reductions in
outpatient costs per enrollee for both mental health and substance
abuse outpatient care (­47.9 percent and ­50.8 percent, respec-
tively).18 This cost reduction reflected declines in number of users
and number of visits per year. Similarly, in comparing the periods
before and after the carve-out, Sturm and colleagues observed sub-

stantial declines in outpatient visits among enrollees in an indem-
nity medical plan, although they also reported slight increases in the
use of intermediate services for the years following the carve-out.19
We know little about the internal strategies and rationales
adopted by managed care providers that may explain these different
patterns. One notable exception is Ma and McGuire's invaluable
case study of the Options contract in Massachusetts.20 They evalu-
ated the performance of the managed care organization relative to
what might have been expected from the formal economic incen-
tives built into the contract. They found, in this instance, that the
contractor continued to reduce utilization and costs well beyond
the target and the financial gains that would accrue. They speculate
that the contractor was going beyond the contract to build its mar-
ket reputation and to position itself for future competition.
There are indications that reductions in the intensity of care may
go too far. Wickizer and Lessler examined whether reduced length-
of-stay resulting from utilization management made it more likely
that patients would be readmitted to the hospital within sixty
days.21 For every day of reduced stay, the odds of readmission within
sixty days increased by 3.1 percent. This is not a large increase, since
the risk of readmission within sixty days is small. However, for
those with large reductions (ten or more days), the risk of readmis-
sion within sixty days was 37 percent higher than for patients
whose days of care were not reduced. This is one of the few studies
than begins to enter the "black box" and alert us to possible prob-
lems in utilization review strategies.
It is disconcerting when investigators observe that reductions in
intensity of care are comparable across diagnostic groups with dif-
ferent needs. Haiden Huskamp, analyzing data from the carve-out
for Massachusetts state employees, found that decline in costs of
facility-only and outpatient episodes was much greater for patients
with unipolar depression than for patients with less serious disor-
ders; reductions in cost were no smaller for persons with schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorders than for persons with less severe dis-
orders.22 In this instance, managed care appeared to reduce intensity
of care for the patients who we would anticipate to have the greatest
need. Some very disabled high users may require a high intensity of
care, and the "democratization" in the distribution of services that
may occur under managed care may not serve them well.
"The `democratization' in the distribution of services that may

To understand how this happens, one needs to examine the po-
litical dynamics of implementing managed care and the decision
processes of managers and clinicians who function in varying man-
aged care frameworks. The chaotic introduction of Medicaid man-
aged care by TennCare Partners in Tennessee, while not necessarily
representative of any other state, provides useful cautionary tales on
how not to proceed and how easy it is to do harm. A valuable case
study by Cyril Chang and colleagues suggested that the process of
implementation not only reduced services overall but also shifted
"resources away from severely mentally ill individuals, for they now
must compete for scarce resources with enrollees who have milder
mental health needs."23
The evaluators of the Utah managed care program found a reduc-
tion in utilization among patients with schizophrenia who had the
most intensive service use prior to managed care. These seriously ill
patients had worse outcomes with managed care.24 It is plausible
that within a context of many needs and constrained resources there
is an inclination toward increased democratization of care. We need
to understand much better how judgments on intensity of care are
made and the extent to which managed care is substituting forms of
care. Reductions across the board should be carefully audited, par-
ticularly with highly vulnerable clients and in situations where the
overall pattern of service use is not unduly high.
Medicaid Managed Care And Vulnerable
Populations
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) estimates that
half of Medicaid beneficiaries will soon be under managed care ar-
rangements.25 Initially cautious about enrolling disabled popula-
tions in such arrangements, some states have begun to move them
into some type of managed care. The structure of managed behav-
ioral health care varies widely from one state to another, but careful
studies of individual cases are beginning to appear. These indicate
that managed care can reduce Medicaid costs with little evidence of
impaired overall quality.26
Concepts of parity, however, require a different perspective when
applied to Medicaid and to persons with greater disabilities. Medic-
aid has had a more comprehensive benefit structure that better re-
sponds to long-term care problems than most private insurance and
has often been effectively coordinated with other public services.
Thus, usual concepts of parity appear overly narrow when applied
to the population of persons with the most severe psychiatric ill-
nesses. A study examining spending for persons with severe and
persistent mental illness in Wisconsin found that more than half

were for nontraditional services, and many such services are un-
likely to be included under usual definitions of medical necessity.27
Carve-out arrangements involving persons with psychiatric dis-
abilities require careful contractual language about the availability
of specific services such as psychosocial rehabilitation and housing
assistance and about the intensity of such services. The boundaries
defining the responsibilities of the managed care vendor, other pub-
lic programs, and the general medical system need to be specifically
addressed, and accountability needs to be well defined. Criteria for
evaluating performance should be explicit, with appropriate ar-
rangements made to ensure that the data required to monitor per-
formance will be available and appropriately formatted. Excellent
legal work has been done to assist states in understanding their
contractual roles in arrangements with vendors that are typically
more expert in contracting than the states are.28
The Vacuum In Evaluating Quality
The history of mental health services has taught us that it is quite
easy to reduce utilization and cost simply by administrative fiat.29
Many localities emptied their mental hospitals but failed to provide
the necessary substitutive services in the community. They served
the mentally ill population badly and did a great deal of harm. This is
not to suggest that managed care practices will necessarily repeat
this experience. But it should make clear that reducing admissions,
length-of-stay, hospital days, or other services, and their associated
expenditures, is the easy part of the process. Doing so in a manner
that provides high-quality care and good outcomes is the more diffi-
cult and more important task.
The importance of developing indicators of quality has been well
articulated, and there is a consensus that measuring quality is im-
portant.30 Moreover, we have seen substantial efforts by proprietary
companies, government agencies, and other stakeholders to develop
standardized quality measures for behavioral health care.31 These
efforts are relatively young, which makes it difficult to judge their
eventual utility. Early experiences, however, do provide some reason
for circumspection. Within the propriety sector, for example, the
American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA)
devised a set of measures (Performance Measures for Managed Be-
havioral Healthcare Programs, or PERMS) to be used by behavioral
health care companies to assess quality; indicators range from meas-
ures of access to measures of satisfaction. Results among thirteen
managed care companies using these indicators ranged widely, so it
is nearly impossible to judge whether the observed variations were
the result of quality differences or methodological problems.32

Within the public sector, the Mental Health Statistics Improvement
Program (MHSIP) developed a set of indicators that also incorpo-
rate access and utilization measures as well as consumer satisfaction
and prevention.33 It is too early, however, to judge the usefulness of
these indicators as they are collected in practice. Others have
strongly argued for the need to collect outcome indicators, in addi-
tion to indicators of processes of care, yet it may prove difficult to
include such measures in large databases.34 Despite these consider-
able efforts, we continue to be nearly flying blind. Complaints and
anecdotes do exist, and these may be indicative of real trouble
spots.35 However, anecdotes are not evidence.
The few good outcome studies we have give us grounds for cau-
tion. The RAND Medical Outcomes Study found that depressed
patients were less likely to be recognized by primary care physicians
in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and, when identified,
were less likely to receive the medication continuity that fee-for-
service patients received and had poorer outcomes.36 Evaluations of
managed care for the Medicaid populations in Minnesota and Utah,
which had longer follow-up periods than most other such studies,
suggest that clients with the most serious illnesses, and who were
the most intensive users of services, were more likely to show wors-
ened outcomes.37 In one of the more comprehensive investigations of
changes after implementation of a prepaid plan for Medicaid en-
rollees with schizophrenia in Utah, Michael Popkin and colleagues
report that the prepaid plans were associated with poorer outcomes
in terms of patients' terminating treatment, overreliance on crisis
intervention, poor medication management, and reduced use of
psychotherapy.38
Some of these studies are now out of date, and each refers to
different managed care arrangements. Thus, we should be careful
not to generalize their findings too widely or to make too much of
them. Managed care is a work in progress, and management strate-
gies are presumably being improved with experience. The studies
themselves all have limitations. Nevertheless, they provide the cau-
tionary guideposts that are greatly needed as we continue down the
managed behavioral health care road. They raise some important
questions: Do some managed care practices shift costs, increase
risks of suicide and violence, reduce work productivity, or limit
functioning and quality of life?
"Parity should be a configuration of management strategies fitted
to careful assessment of patients' needs."

Parity requires an understanding of the components of a good
mental health service and of what is required to treat clients with
variations in need and severity of illness. The uncertainties that
persist within any kind of evidence-based framework make it rela-
tively easy to reduce services in a shotgun fashion. The call for parity
by advocates came within the context of indemnity insurance, but
few believed that this could be achieved without managing services.
Behavioral health care management thus offers advantages in ex-
panding the range of insured services and giving more patients ac-
cess to a mental health service. The challenge for the coming decade
is to develop clear standards based on the best evidence and clinical
judgment so that parity has substance in implementation as well as
in concept. Parity is not simply some match in service limits to what
a medical or surgical patient experiences. It should be a configura-
tion of management strategies fitted to careful assessment of pa-
tients' needs and a response that is consistent with our best scien-
tific knowledge.39
A Concluding Note For The Policymaker
There is much rhetoric about managed behavioral health care, but
policymakers must appreciate the uncertainties. Most state policy-
makers have been wise in moving slowly and cautiously in extending
such practices to their disabled populations. Most disabled persons
enroll voluntarily in managed care, and only a few states have re-
quired participation of severely and persistently mentally ill persons.
Managed behavioral health care has gained much valuable experi-
ence with employed populations and in moderating some of the
excesses of traditional patterns of fee-for-service and cost reim-
bursement in mental health care. But until we have (and use) more-
sophisticated quality measurement, the temptation will remain to
manage costs and not care. Awareness of the mental health parity
issues has increased in recent years, and there is growing support for
policies that remove discrimination against the mentally ill. A well-
managed parity benefit need not be expensive, as some analyses
have suggested. But it is equally important to understand that any
parity policy must be implemented through access that extends
beyond traditional concepts of medical necessity, particularly in
relation to public clients.
Managed behavioral health care is new to the arena of disabled
clients and their multiple needs. It is still unclear whether such
clients will be attractive to managed care providers, given their
complex needs and the financial constraints likely to be imposed by
public purchasers. But to the extent that such clients are attractive,
public purchasers take on new and important roles. First, they must

be sophisticated buyers and understand that they share responsibil-
ity for poor outcomes when they simply seek to pay the lowest
capitation rate. They need to become expert in contracting, under-
standing not only the elements of appropriate benefit design but
also the boundaries between contracted responsibilities and what
remains of the public safety net. They also need to give attention to
preserving the safety net, because experience indicates that it will
still be needed. Behavioral health care is an area in which it is rela-
tively easy to shift costs and responsibilities to other sectors, so
boundaries have to be clear and transparent to monitoring efforts.
However inadequate the existing outcome studies are, they make it
clear that aggregate outcomes for populations often fail to reveal the
consequences for small subpopulations who have the greatest needs
and who are often the most disadvantaged and vulnerable.
Quality measurement in behavioral health care is still relatively
primitive. In the long run, the accountability of managed care will
depend on our ability to develop a reasonable consensus on practice
standards and quality indicators. Work is proceeding on such devel-
opment, but the field is not advanced enough to provide the needed
assurance. As a start, policymakers and purchasers in both the pub-
lic and private sectors must ensure, through their contracting, that
the necessary data are available to monitor access and performance
and that such data are not simply proprietary products.
We are now entering a period in which the challenge of managing
care and reducing expenditures will become more difficult without
doing harm. Several elements contribute to this. First, most of the
easy reductions have already been made, and the cost/quality trade-
offs are tougher. Second, purchasers, having had a taste of the possi-
ble cost reductions, have learned to bargain more aggressively with
behavioral health care organizations. This puts greater pressure on
these organizations to keep utilization low. Third, consumers and
their advocates have become more knowledgeable and aggressive
and will increasingly act as a countervailing force. Fourth, the avail-
ability of new, more expensive drugs, and coalitions between phar-
maceutical companies and consumers to make drugs more available,
will contribute to increased costs. Fifth, increasing government
regulation of managed care practices in general, and behavioral
health care in particular, in response to many complaints by con-
sumers and advocates, will make cost reductions more challenging.
It is too easy to blame managed care for all of the defi-
ciencies of mental health practice. Policymakers, purchasers,
providers, and consumers all have a vital role and responsibility
and need to cooperate in supporting patterns of practice that pro-

vide value for money but also are sensitive to the special needs and
vulnerabilities of persons with widely varying conditions and dis-
abilities. Purchasers need to understand that going with the lowest
bidder will mean that clients are much less likely to benefit from
new technologies. Advocates must understand that while in an ideal
world they would like unlimited access, they too must establish
priorities and not demand a pattern of service that is unsustainable.
Providers must accustom themselves to a more scientifically based
pattern of practice. Parity is a fine concept, but if it is to be fully
meaningful it must be designed to meet access and quality chal-
lenges and diversity of need.
