Introduction
Lung cancer (LC) is a major cause of cancer death world-
wide with 1 million deaths each year.1 More than 80% of
LC cases are of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),2 and
it has been estimated that 51% of patients present with
advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.3 Although much
progress has been made in optimizing the treatment of LC
(including multidisciplinary therapy, targeted therapy,
etc.), the 5-year overall survival rate remains about 15%
for all stages.1 Therefore, it is important to find new thera-
pies which could prevent LC development.
The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates
angiotensin II (AngII), the active peptide of the renin­
angiotensin system (RAS) that regulates blood pressure.
ACE has also been associated with cell proliferation, angi-
ogenesis, and inflammation.4 The receptor of AngII, the
AngII type1 receptor (AT1R) subtype, is expressed on
tumor and endothelial cells, and is upregulated in many
cancer tissues. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are
used as one of the first-choice drugs for patients with
hypertension. Some studies reported thatARB user showed
decreased LC risk. However, other studies could not
confirm this result.5­12 Thus, the result is still controver-
sial. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the rela-
tionship between ARB and LC risk.

Abstract
Background: Several reports suggest that the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is associated with lung
cancer (LC) reduction. However, the results were contradictory.
Methods: Four online databases were searched. The strength of the association between ARB and the risk of LC was
measured by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). OR was analyzed by random-effects model.
Results: Eight studies with 298000 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Using of ARB was significantly associated
with decreased LC risk (OR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.69­0.94; p = 0.005). In the subgroup analysis by race, Asians treated with
ARB showed decreased LC risk (OR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.54­0.67; p < 0.00001). However, Caucasians treated with ARB
did not show significantly decreased LC risk (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.79­1.02; p = 0.11). Subgroup analysis by duration of
follow-up was conducted. The studies with less than 5 years showed significant result (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.64­0.97;
p = 0.02). However, the studies with more than 5 years did not show significantly decreased LC risk (OR = 0.84; 95%
CI 0.61­1.16; p = 0.29).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that ARBs may be associated with decreased risk of LC.

and Wanfang. The search terms were "angiotensin receptor
blocker" or ARB, "lung cancer or lung carcinoma or lung
neoplasm" in various combinations, with no language limi-
tation. The reference list of each relevant publication was
also reviewed to ensure that all appropriate studies were
included in the meta-analysis.
Study selection
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the research was
a case-control study or a cohort study; (2) the study investi-
gated the association between ARB and LC risk; (3) suffi-
cient published data about sample size, odds ratio (OR), and
their 95% confidence interval (CI). Studies were excluded
when they were: (1) a duplicate publication; (2) meta-
analyses, letters, reviews, or editorial articles.
Data extraction
Two reviewers collected the data and reached a consensus
on all items. The following items were extracted from each
study if available: first author, year of publication, study
design, ethnicity, age, gender, sample size, follow-up
years, and covariates.
Qualitative assessment
Two authors completed the quality assessment indepen-
dently. The Newcastle­Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to
evaluate the methodological quality, which scored studies
by the selection of the study groups, the comparability of
the groups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of inter-
est. We considered a study awarded 0­3, 4­6, or 7­9 as a
low-, moderate-, or high-quality study, respectively.
Statistical analysis
The strength of the association between ARB and the risk
of LC was measured by OR and 95% CI. OR was analyzed
by random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated by
an 2-based Q statistic and was considered statistically sig-
nificant when p < 0.10. The significance of the pooled OR
was determined by the Z-test and was considered statisti-
cally when the p-value was less than 0.05. Subgroup analy-
ses by ethnic groups and follow-up years (less than 5 years
or not) were performed. Publication bias was analyzed by
funnel plots and Egger's test. All statistical tests were per-
formed using the Revman 5.1 and STATA 11.0 software.
Results
Eligible studies
Eight studies with 298,000 subjects were included in this
meta-analysis. Three studies were case-control studies
and five studies were cohort studies. Three studies were
conducted in Asian patients and four studies were per-
formed in Caucasian patients. The median follow-up dura-
tion ranged from 2.9 to 7.8 years. The quality score ranged
from 7 to 9, suggesting that the quality of the studies was
good. The characteristics of included studies are showed in
Table 1.
Quantitative data synthesis
As shown in Figure 1, using of ARB was significantly
associated with decreased LC risk (OR = 0.81; 95% CI
0.69­0.94; p = 0.005). In the subgroup analysis by race,
Asians treated with ARB showed decreased LC risk (OR
= 0.60; 95% CI 0.54­0.67; p < 0.00001; Figure 2).
However, Caucasians treated with ARB did not show sig-
nificantly decreased LC risk (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.79­
1.02; p = 0.11; Figure 2). Subgroup analysis by duration
of follow-up was conducted. As shown in Figure 3, the
studies with less than 5 years' duration showed signifi-
cant result (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.64­0.97; p = 0.02).
However, the studies of more than 5 years did not show
significantly decreased LC risk (OR = 0.84; 95% CI
0.61­1.16; p = 0.29). When we limited the meta-analysis
to studies that controlled for confounders such as age,
sex, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and anti-hyper-
tensive agents, a significant association between ARB
use and decreased LC risk remained (Table 2). However,
when we limited the meta-analysis to studies that con-
trolled for statins or smoking, the result was changed
(Table 2).
The funnel plot and Egger's test were performed for the
overall comparison. No obvious visual asymmetry was
observed in funnel plots (Figure 4), and the p-value of the
Egger's test was greater than 0.05, indicating no statistical
evidence for publication bias among studies.
Discussion
The present meta-analysis of eight observational studies
showed that the use of ARBs could decrease LC risk. This
result suggested that ARBs might be a protective factor for
LC. However, this protective value was only found in
Asians and not in Caucasians. It was possible that different
lifestyles, diets, and environments may account for this
discrepancy. In addition, we found that this protective
effect might decrease if the duration of follow-up is more
than 5 years. This result indicated that time might modify
the effect of ARB on LC risk. Furthermore, we observed
that statin and smoking status could also modify the effect
of ARB on LC risk.
RAS signaling has been shown to increase cell prolif-
eration during malignancy, and ARBs are able to decrease
pro-survival signaling by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mole-
cules and suppressing caspase activity.4 A previous study

found that telmisartan could induce apoptosis via down-
regulation of Bcl-2 and involvement of caspase-3 in
human renal cancer cells.13 Wilop and coworkers sug-
gested that addition of ACEI or ARB to platinum-based
first-line chemotherapy may contribute to prolonged sur-
vival in patients with advanced LC.14 Inhibition of RAS
could also improve the risk and survival of other cancers.
Rao et al. found a small, but statistically significant,
reduction in the incidence of clinically detected prostate
cancer among patients assigned to receive ARB.15
Babacan et al. suggested that the use of ACE inhibitors/
ARBs may be effective in N3+ breast cancer patients.16
Chen et al. indicated that administration of ACEIs/ARBs
was independently associated with superior overall sur-
vival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma receiving oesophagectomy.17
Our analysis has several limitations. First, all the
included studies were observational investigations and
cannot thus support any causality between the use of ARB
and LC risk. Second, the lack of the original data of the
eligible studies limited the evaluation of the effects of
ARB on different populations, such as smokers and non-
smokers. In addition, the subgroup analysis of statins was
also not conducted. Third, although we performed an
extensive review of the main electronic databases, we can-
not be sure to have included all relevant studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that ARBs may
be associated with decreased risk of LC. ABRs might be
one of the chemoprophylactic drugs of LC.
