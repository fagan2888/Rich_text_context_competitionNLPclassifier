Background--Lead and cadmium exposure may promote atherosclerosis, although the cardiovascular effects of chronic
low-dose exposure are largely unknown. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between
blood levels of lead and cadmium and peripheral arterial disease.
Methods and Results--We analyzed data from 2125 participants who were 40 years of age in the 1999 to 2000 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle brachial index
0.9 in at least 1 leg. Lead and cadmium levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. After adjustment
for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, the ORs of peripheral arterial disease comparing quartiles 2 to 4 of lead
with the lowest quartile were 1.63 (95% CI, 0.51 to 5.15), 1.92 (95% CI, 0.62 to 9.47), and 2.88 (95% CI, 0.87 to 9.47),
respectively (P for trend0.02). The corresponding ORs for cadmium were 1.07 (95% CI, 0.44 to 2.60), 1.30 (95% CI,
0.69 to 2.44), and 2.82 (95% CI, 1.36 to 5.85), respectively (P for trend0.01). The OR of peripheral arterial disease
for current smokers compared with never smokers was 4.13. Adjustment for lead reduced this OR to 3.38, and
adjustment for cadmium reduced it to 1.84.
Conclusions--Blood lead and cadmium, at levels well below current safety standards, were associated with an increased
prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in the general US population. Cadmium may partially mediate the effect of
smoking on peripheral arterial disease. (Circulation. 2004;109:3196-3201.)
Key Words: cadmium  lead  peripheral vascular diseases  smoking
Lead and cadmium are established toxic and carcinogenic
metals.1,2 Most studies of the cardiovascular effects of
these elements in humans have focused on their association
with increased blood pressure.3,4 Other cardiovascular end
points remain largely unexplored, although increased expo-
sure to lead and cadmium has been associated with cardio-
vascular events in some5­9 but not all10,11 studies. Lead and
cadmium increase oxidative stress,12 affect endothelial func-
tion,13 promote inflammation,14 downregulate nitric oxide
production,15,16 and induce renal dysfunction,17 mechanisms
that could implicate these metals in the development of
atherosclerosis.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by flow-
limiting atherosclerosis in the muscular arteries of the lower
extremities. Relative to other risk factors, smoking is more
strongly associated with PAD than atherosclerosis in carotid
or coronary arteries,18,19 although the reasons are unknown.
Smoking, however, is an important source of exposure to lead
and especially to cadmium.20 Cadmium in cigarettes has been
proposed as a causative agent for cigarette smoke­induced
cardiovascular disease.20,21 We thus hypothesized that cad-
mium and lead exposure increases the risk of PAD and that
they mediate the effect of smoking on PAD.
To investigate the association of lead and cadmium expo-
sure with PAD, we evaluated the relation between blood lead
and cadmium levels and the ankle-brachial blood pressure
index (ABI), a highly specific marker of subclinical PAD,22
in a representative sample of US adults 40 years of age.
Methods
Study Population
This study used data from the 1999 to 2000 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which was selected to
represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.23 Detailed
in-person interviews, physical examinations, and serum samples
were obtained from 9965 persons. ABI was measured in subjects
40 years of age (3185 subjects). Among them, 2381 (75% of those
eligible) had a valid ABI measurement. We excluded 6 participants
with ABI values 1.5 (values usually related to noncompressible
vessels in the legs)24 and 250 participants (10.5%) with missing
values in at least 1 of the variables of interest, leaving 2125
individuals in the sample.
Peripheral Arterial Disease
A specific protocol was used to measure ABI in NHANES 1999 to
2000.23 The measurements of blood pressure used for ABI were
different from other measurements of blood pressure used to evaluate

hypertension in NHANES 1999 to 2000. For ABI determination,
systolic blood pressure was measured on the right arm (brachial
artery) and both ankles (posterior tibial arteries) with a Doppler
device, the Parks Mini-Laboratory IV, model 3100 (Parks Medical
Electronics). If the participant had a condition that would interfere
with blood pressure reading in the right arm, the left arm was used.
Systolic blood pressure was measured twice at each site for partic-
ipants 40 to 59 years of age and once at each site for participants 60
years of age. The left and right ABI measurements were obtained by
dividing the ankle mean systolic blood pressure in each side by the
mean systolic brachial blood pressure. PAD was defined as an ABI
value 0.90 in at least 1 leg.24
Blood Lead and Cadmium
Blood for lead and cadmium measurements was collected in ordinary
tubes after confirmation of no background contamination in all
collection and storage materials.23 The cadmium and lead levels in
whole blood were measured at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention/National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) En-
vironmental Health Laboratory Sciences Laboratory on a Perkin-
Elmer model SIMAA 6000 simultaneous multielement atomic ab-
sorption spectrometer with Zeeman background correction.23 The
detection limits were 0.01 mol/L for lead and 2.5 nmol/L for
cadmium. Two subjects in the study sample had levels below the
detection limit for lead, and 230 (9.7%) had levels below the
detection limit for cadmium. For these subjects, we imputed a level
equal to the limit of detection divided by 2.25 The analytical
laboratory followed extensive quality control procedures.23 National
Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Materials
whole-blood materials were used for external calibration. The
interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.1% to 4.0% for
lead and from 4.1% to 7.3% for cadmium.
Other Variables of Interest
Information on age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and alcohol consump-
tion was based on self-report, and body mass index was calculated by
dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Hypertension
was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, a mean
diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, a self-reported physician diagno-
sis, or medication use. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total
cholesterol level 6.2 mmol/L, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or
medication use. Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose
7.0 mmol/L, a nonfasting glucose 11.1 mmol/L, a self-reported
physician diagnosis, or medication use.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured with a Behring
Nephelometer II Analyzer. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated
by use of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula
with calibrated serum creatinine levels to account for laboratory
differences between NHANES III and NHANES 1999 to 2000.26
Serum cotinine was measured by an isotope-dilution high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ioniza-
tion tandem mass spectrometric method.23
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN software
(Research Triangle Institute) to account for the complex sampling
design and weights in NHANES 1999 to 2000. The jackknife
"leave-one-out" method was used to obtain appropriate SEs of all
estimates.
Blood lead and cadmium levels were log transformed to improve
normality. Adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs were used to compare
each quartile of lead or cadmium distribution with their lowest
quartile. Quartile cutoffs were based on the weighted distribution of
lead and cadmium. Probability values for linear trend were obtained
by including log-transformed metal levels as continuous variables in
the regression models. Smoking was adjusted for by use of self-
reported smoking status (never, former, current) and cotinine levels
in serum. Similar results were obtained when smoking was modeled
as number of cigarettes currently smoked or as cumulative pack-
years of smoking (data not shown). The final models included
adjustment for demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors,
glomerular filtration rate, and C-reactive protein. We also assessed
possible interactions between lead and cadmium and between each
metal with sex, race-ethnicity, smoking status, renal function, or
C-reactive protein. Because no clear interactions were observed and
no interactions were statistically significant, they were not included
in the final models.
Results
The geometric means of blood lead and cadmium levels were
0.10 mol/L and 4.5 nmol/L, respectively (Table 1). Lead
and cadmium levels were higher in older subjects, in those
with lower educational levels, and in smokers. Both metals
were highest in current smokers, although smoking was more
strongly associated with cadmium. Lead levels were higher in
men, in blacks, in Mexican Americans, and in alcohol
drinkers. Cadmium levels were higher in women, with no
substantial differences by race-ethnicity or by drinking status.
The correlation between lead and cadmium was 0.32
(P0.001).
After adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk
factors, subjects with PAD had 13.8% (95% CI, 5.9 to 12.9)
higher mean levels of lead and 16.1% (95% CI, 4.7 to 28.7)
higher mean levels of cadmium than subjects without PAD.
The association of lead and cadmium with PAD was strong
and progressive (Table 2), even after multivariable adjust-
ment. Simultaneously adjusting for the other metal did not
appreciably alter the association for either cadmium or lead.
Compared with never smokers, current smoking was asso-
ciated with an OR of 4.13 for PAD (Table 3). Adjusting for
lead reduced the OR for smoking and PAD to 3.38, whereas
adjusting for cadmium reduced this OR to 1.84.
Discussion
Blood lead and cadmium levels were strongly associated with
an increased prevalence of PAD in a representative sample of
US adults. The decrease in the association of cigarette
smoking with PAD after adjustment for cadmium suggests
that the effect of smoking on PAD is partly mediated by the
cadmium content of cigarettes. The observed increase in PAD
prevalence occurred at lead and cadmium levels much lower
than current safety levels used by environmental and occu-
pational regulatory agencies. For instance, only 1 study
participant had lead levels 1.93 mol/L (40 g/dL), the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Safety Standard for lead in whole blood,27 and only 35 (1.6%)
had lead levels 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention criterion for elevated blood
levels in children and pregnant women.28 Similarly, all
participants had cadmium levels 44.5 nmol/L (5 g/L), the
OSHA Safety Standard for cadmium.29
The general population can be exposed to lead and cad-
mium in ambient air near industrial and combustion sources,
in certain foods, through smoking, and sometimes in drinking
water.1,2 Lead exposure has declined substantially in the last
2 decades after the ban on leaded gasoline.30 Lead exposure
still occurs in urban environments, particularly in areas near
emission sources, and through contact with lead dusts and
soils. Exposure to cadmium in the general population results
from exposure to cigarette smoke, inhalation of ambient air

near coal-fired power plants and municipal waste incinera-
tors, and from consumption of some foods (highest levels in
shellfish, liver, and kidney meats). Compared with workers in
smelting, refining, and manufacturing industries, the preva-
lence of elevated exposures to lead or cadmium in the general
population is low,1,2 and the levels in this study were much
lower than those reported in retired workers.31,32
Several mechanisms may explain an increased risk of
atherosclerosis with lead or cadmium. Experimental studies
show that both metals contribute to oxidative stress by
catalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species,12,15
increasing lipid peroxidation,33,34 and depleting glutathione
and protein-bound sulfhydryl groups.12 Lead and cadmium
may also stimulate the production of inflammatory cyto-
kines14 and may induce endothelial damage by downregulat-
ing nitric oxide production.15,16 Both metals have also in-
duced atherosclerosis in some models in vivo.35 The
relevance of these mechanisms to human atherogenesis and to
PAD, however, is uncertain because mechanistic studies are
typically conducted at higher doses than the concentrations
observed in the present study. Furthermore, the effects of lead
and cadmium in our study persisted after adjustment for

glomerular filtration rate and for C-reactive protein, suggest-
ing that mechanisms other than impaired renal function and
inflammation were involved. Additional studies, at very low
levels, are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of
these metals at current levels of exposure in the general
population.
An important finding of our study was the decrease in the
association of smoking with PAD after adjustment for cad-
mium. This pattern suggests that the effect of smoking on
PAD is mediated partly by cadmium. In addition to cadmium,
several agents in tobacco are considered to contribute to
cardiovascular disease, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen
oxides, hydrogen cyanide, tar, zinc, and carbon disulfide.20
Although we could not evaluate the relative contribution of
cadmium compared with other tobacco components, it is
important to note that the effect of cadmium persisted after
adjustment for cotinine levels or for reported intensity of
smoking, indicating that the effect of cadmium is not likely to
be confounded by smoking or by compounds in cigarette
smoke. Because ABI was the only marker of atherosclerosis
available in NHANES 1999 to 2000, we could not evaluate
whether cadmium is specifically associated with PAD or
whether a similar association is present for other vascular
territories. However, it is well established that smoking is
more strongly associated with PAD than with atherosclerosis
in other arteries18,19; therefore, the effect of cadmium on other
cardiovascular outcomes is of great interest.
Our findings are consistent with previous cohort studies
showing a positive association of blood lead with cardiovas-
cular mortality in NHANES II5 and with coronary heart
disease incidence in Denmark.6 Another cohort study in
British men, however, did not show an association between
blood lead and cardiovascular disease incidence.10 Few stud-
ies have evaluated the association between cadmium and
cardiovascular outcomes. Ecological studies have found as-
sociations of cardiovascular mortality rates with cadmium
levels in air7 and in soil and water.36 Two small case-control
studies found higher blood cadmium in subjects with myo-

cardial infarction compared with control subjects,8,9 but a
cross-sectional study in Belgium found no association be-
tween blood cadmium and the prevalence of cardiovascular
disease.11 Finally, several autopsy studies have found associ-
ations between tissue lead or cadmium levels and atheroscle-
rotic lesions.37,38
Several limitations of this study should be considered. The
cross-sectional design and the use of prevalent cases of PAD
limit conclusions regarding the direction or causality of the
observed associations. Because ABI is a subclinical marker
and PAD is often asymptomatic,39 our design may be some-
what resistant to biases introduced when symptomatic sub-
jects modify their levels of exposures. Indeed, the associa-
tions between PAD and traditional risk factors in NHANES
1999 to 2000 were of the expected direction and magnitude
(data not shown). Prospective studies with incident cases of
PAD, however, are needed to confirm our findings. Another
possible limitation of our study is confounding by socioeco-
nomic status, by differences in urbanization, or by other
pollutants that may occur in the same environmental settings.
We note, however, that although no data are currently
available in NHANES 1999 to 2000 on income or urban/rural
residence, our results persisted after adjustment for educa-
tional level and for race-ethnicity. Finally, our analyses were
based on single blood measurements of lead and cadmium,
imperfect biomarkers of chronic exposure. Environmental
exposures, however, are likely to be less changeable than
occupational exposures, and single blood levels are fre-
quently used biomarkers in population studies.5,11,25 It is also
likely that, because of the limitations of blood lead and
cadmium as biomarkers, our results underestimate the asso-
ciations of both metals with PAD.
The strengths of the study come from the rigorous sam-
pling design and the quality of the study measurements used
in NHANES. These results are representative of the US
noninstitutionalized civilian population. Other strengths in-
clude the use of ABI, a noninvasive measure of atheroscle-
rosis particularly useful for epidemiological studies, and the
large sample size. Furthermore, lead and cadmium in blood
are biomarkers of internal dose that integrate all routes of
exposure.25
Although our findings need confirmation in prospective
studies and support from mechanistic studies at low levels of
exposure, we conclude that blood lead and cadmium, at levels
well below current safety standards, were associated with an
increased prevalence of PAD in a representative sample of
US adults. In addition, cadmium exposure explained a sub-
stantial part of the effect of smoking on PAD.
